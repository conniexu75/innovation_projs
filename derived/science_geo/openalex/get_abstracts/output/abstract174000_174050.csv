https://openalex.org/W2060628991,"Cancer cells display high rates of aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known historically as the Warburg effect. Lactate and pyruvate, the end products of glycolysis, are highly produced by cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen. Hypoxia-induced gene expression in cancer cells has been linked to malignant transformation. Here we provide evidence that lactate and pyruvate regulate hypoxia-inducible gene expression independently of hypoxia by stimulating the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α). In human gliomas and other cancer cell lines, the accumulation of HIF-1α protein under aerobic conditions requires the metabolism of glucose to pyruvate that prevents the aerobic degradation of HIF-1α protein, activates HIF-1 DNA binding activity, and enhances the expression of several HIF-1-activated genes including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 3, and aldolase A. Our findings support a novel role for pyruvate in metabolic signaling and suggest a mechanism by which high rates of aerobic glycolysis can promote the malignant transformation and survival of cancer cells."

Here we show that the PARP-2 gene, mainly expressed in actively dividing tissues follows, but to a smaller extent, that of PARP-1 during mouse development. We found that PARP-2 and PARP-1 homo- and heterodimerize; the interacting interfaces, sites of reciprocal modification, have been mapped. PARP-2 was also found to interact with three other proteins involved in the base excision repair pathway: x-ray cross complementing factor 1 (XRCC1), DNA polymerase β, and DNA ligase III, already known as partners of PARP-1. XRCC1 negatively regulates PARP-2 activity, as it does for PARP-1, while being a polymer acceptor for both PARP-1 and PARP-2. To gain insight into the physiological role of PARP-2 in response to genotoxic stress, we developed by gene disruption mice deficient in PARP-2. Following treatment by the alkylating agentN-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), PARP-2-deficient cells displayed an important delay in DNA strand breaks resealing, similar to that observed in PARP-1 deficient cells, thus confirming that PARP-2 is also an active player in base excision repair despite its low capacity to synthesize ADP-ribose polymers.

PARP-1 is a nuclear enzyme involved in the detection and signaling of DNA strand breaks introduced either directly by ionizing radiation or indirectly following enzymatic incision of a DNA lesion (abasic sites or oxidized or alkylated bases) repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway (see for review Ref. 1de Murcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signalling to Cell Death. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar). The discovery of numerous PARP-1 protein partners and/or poly(ADP-ribose) acceptors involved in DNA architecture (histones H1 and H2B, lamin B, and high mobility group proteins) or in DNA metabolism (DNA replication factors, DNA repair proteins, i.e. XRCC1, transcription factors, topoisomerases, and PARP-1 itself) has shed light onto the implication of PARP-1 in these processes (see for review Ref. 1de Murcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signalling to Cell Death. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar). The function of PARP-1 in BER has long been assumed, until direct evidence demonstrated the presence of PARP-1 in the BER complex, associated to XRCC1 (2Caldecott K. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S.

The polymer produced by PARP-1 upon activation by DNA breaks triggers the recruitment of XRCC1, which shows high affinity for oligo(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 (3Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V.

The requirement of PARP-1 in BER was established in vivo, because PARP-1 knock-out cells displayed a severe defect in strand breaks resealing following genotoxic treatment (6Trucco C.

The preferential role of PARP-1 in long patch BER was observed using extracts from these PARP-1 knock-out cells (4Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Ménissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G.

In reconstituted in vitro systems containing purified human BER enzymes, PARP-1 was shown to stimulate strand displacement DNA synthesis by DNA polβ, in cooperation with FEN-1, leading to long patch BER (9Prasad R.

In proliferative cells inflicted with sub-lethal doses of DNA damage, PARP-1 as a survival factor participates in DNA damage detection and signaling, leading to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, to avoid deleterious genetic alterations (1de Murcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signalling to Cell Death. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar). On the other hand, in post-mitotic cells, massive DNA damage as observed in pathological conditions such as cerebellar or cardiac ischemia or septic shock and to overactivate PARP-1, triggering energy depletion that leads to cell death (see for review Ref. 13Szabo C. de Murcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signalling to Cell Death. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 151-176Google Scholar). The PARP-1 knock-out mice were at the origin of the discovery of a new DNA damage-dependent PARP protein, named PARP-2, because an unexpected residual poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis could be measured in PARP-1-deficient cells following DNA damage (14Shieh W.M.

McDaniel A. Dong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are the only ones reported to be DNA damage-dependent, and in Arabidopsis thalianaboth PARP-1 and PARP-2 genes are induced by ionizing radiation (24Doucet-Chabeaud G. Godon C. Brutesco C. de Murcia G. Kazmaier M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of mammalian PARP-2 contains a nuclear location signal and a functional DNA binding domain (15Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) distinct from that of PARP-1 (two zinc fingers). The nature of this DNA binding domain has yet to be determined. In our attempts to further characterize PARP-2 and compare its biological implication with that of PARP-1 with respect to DNA damage surveillance, we discovered that the expression pattern of PARP-2 and PARP-1 genes follows almost the same tissue distribution. The two proteins homo- and heterodimerize and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate each other. In addition, PARP-2 was found to interact with the BER proteins XRCC1, DNA polβ, and DNA ligase III, all being PARP-1 partners as well. XRCC1 could be heteromodified by PARP-2 and was able to negatively regulate PARP-2 activity as it does for PARP-1. The requirement for PARP-2 in BER was demonstrated in vivo by the COMET assay in mouse embryonic cells lacking PARP-2. Our results showed that PARP-2 is a component of a functional BER complex in vivo, likely through dimerization with PARP-1. This strengthens the role of PARP-2 as a survival factor following genotoxic stress. The SmaI/NotI fragment encoding full-length murine PARP-2 (mPARP-2) cDNA was isolate from pVL-mPARP-2 (15Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol.

BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 142-145PubMed Google Scholar) in-frame with GST, allowing the expression of GST-mPARP-2 fusion protein. Truncated forms of mPARP-2 were generated by PCR and cloned in-frame with GST in the pBC vector. TheXhoI/XhoI PCR product encompassing full-length mPARP-2 was ligated into the XhoI site of pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), allowing the expression of GFP-mPARP-2. Complementary oligonucleotides encoding the FLAG epitope following a methionine were linked into theEcoRV/EcoRI sites of the pIRES-eGFP vector (CLONTECH), allowing the expression of the FLAG epitope (F). The cDNA encoding full-length human XRCC1 (hXRCC1, kindly given by K. Caldecott) was subcloned into the EcoRI sites of pIRES-FLAG vector, allowing the expression of FLAG-tagged XRCC1 (F-hXRCC1). In situ hybridization was performed as described in Niederreither and Dollé (26Niederreither K. Dollé P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 89: 247-267PubMed Google Scholar) on serial sections (10 μm) of frozen embryos or mouse adult organs dissected from 2- or 16-week CD1 mice and frozen in OCT. AXhoI/PstI fragment from a mouse PARP-1 EST clone (AA032357, Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), encoding residues 337–572, was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+), and antisense and sense mPARP-1 riboprobes were produced using T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively. The murine PARP-2 probe corresponding to residues 8–363 is described in Amé et al. (15Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T.

Exposure varied from 4 to 6 weeks for PARP-1 and PARP-2 probes. For immunoprecipitation of purified proteins, 1 μg of purified hPARP-1 and/or mPARP-2 (as indicated) was incubated 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of F1.23 monoclonal anti-PARP-1 antibody and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin in 1 ml of LSB (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were added, and after 30-min incubation at 4 °C, bound immune complexes were washed three times with LSB buffer, and the pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and heated 3 min at 100 °C before analysis by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous PARP-1 from HeLa cells, cells were lysed in LSB buffer 20 min at 4 °C, scraped, and centrifuge 20 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. After preclearing with protein G-Sepharose 30 min at 4 °C, 20 μl of F1.23 anti-PARP-1 antibody was added, and immunoprecipitation was carried on as described above. GST-pull-down analyses were performed in HeLa S3 cells as described in Dantzer et al. (4Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Ménissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V.

Tomkinson, San Antonio, TX) polyclonal antibodies or with anti-GST (1/10,000, Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France) and anti-GFP (1/1000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) monoclonal antibodies. Blots where then probed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit, 1/20,000 or sheep anti-mouse, 1/20,000, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), and immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). When indicated, 3-AB (1 mm) was added 2 h prior to lysis and maintained throughout all the lysis and washing steps. GST pull-down assays were performed as described above, except that washes were done with HSB (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a last wash with activity buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol), each sample was split onto three, the beads were pelleted (volume of the pellet: ± 20 μl) and resuspended in 300 μl of activity buffer containing either 300 pmol of hPARP-1, 600 pmol of mPARP-2, or no PARP. Reaction was started by the addition of 180 μl of activity buffer containing DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA, and [32P]NAD. Final concentrations were 0.5 μg of DNA, 1 μm NAD for control, and PARP-2 and 0.1 μm for PARP-1 samples. In addition, each sample contained 1 pmol of [32P]NAD (1000 Ci/mmol). After 4 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of cold HSB on ice, and beads were washed three times with HSB, resuspended in 12 μl of Laemmli buffer, and heated for 3 min at 100 °C before analysis by Western blot. Purified mPARP-2 (200 pmol) was incubated with 1- to 8-fold purified hXRCC1 (3Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) for 2 min at 25 °C in 40 μl of activity buffer containing 300 ng of bovine serum albumin, 5 μm [32P]NAD (1000 Ci/mmol), and 100 ng of DNase I activated calf thymus DNA. Reaction was stopped by addition of 15 μl of Laemmli buffer on ice, and reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the Coomassie Blue-stained and dried gel. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated by micro-dissection of embryos at day 13.5 of gestation resulting from intercrosses between PARP-2+/− heterozygous mice. Each embryo was genotyped by PCR to screen for the disruption of the PARP-2 allele. The generation of these mice and the genotyping PCR procedure will be described elsewhere. MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% gentamicin. For Western blot analysis, 105cells were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and sonicated, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot as described above, using anti-PARP-2 (Yuc) and anti-PARP-1 (Monte) polyclonal antibodies. The evaluation of residual poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in MEF cell extracts was performed as described by Amé et al. (15Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Passage 3 MEFs were thawed 48 h prior to harvesting on 60-mm Petri dishes. The following day, cells were either mock treated or exposed for 30 min to N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU) as indicated. COMET assay was performed as described in Trucco et al. (6Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Slides were dried in cold ethanol, and DNA was stained prior to scoring with 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Fifty COMET per slide were observed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a DP50 camera (Olympus) and analyzed using the VisCOMET software (Impuls Bildanalyse GmbH, Gilsching, Germany) to calculate the tail moment as defined by Olive et al. (27Olive P.L. Banath J.P. Durand R.E. Radiat. Res. 1990; 122: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). In situhybridization experiments were performed to compare the expression patterns of the PARP-1 and PARP-2 genes at various stages of mouse development and in adult tissues. Antisense probes for PARP-1 and PARP-2 yielded specific labeling patterns that appeared similar although not perfectly identical. During early developmental stages, both genes were expressed throughout the embryo (data not shown). Differential labeling patterns became apparent by E12.5. At that stage, both genes were expressed at high levels in the developing liver and kidney (Fig. 1,A–C). Only PARP-1, however, was found to be expressed at higher levels in the genital ridge and the spinal ganglia. The signals observed throughout other embryonic regions for both PARP-1 and PARP-2 antisense probes were higher than for the corresponding sense probes (data not shown), indicating a ubiquitous moderate expression of both enzymes. At E18.5 (Fig. 1, D–I), PARP-1 and to a lesser extent PARP-2 were preferentially expressed in the thymus and in regions of the nervous system (see below). Within the developing trunk, preferential expression of PARP-1 andPARP-2 persisted in the liver and became restricted to the cortical region of the kidney, the spleen, adrenal gland, and in stomach and intestinal epithelia (Fig. 1, G–I, and data not shown). Note that PARP-1 transcripts appeared more restricted than those of PARP-2 toward the base of the intestinal crypts (G–I, insets). From E14.5 to E18.5, as well as in the adult mouse, both genes were expressed at the highest levels in the thymus (Fig. 1, D–F and data not shown). In the adult mouse,PARP-1 and -2 expression was particularly high in the subcapsular zone of the thymus (data not shown), where immature lymphocytes proliferate. Expression decreased as lymphocytes mature and was also found in the medulla. PARP-1, and to a lesser extend, PARP-2 transcripts were detected in the white pulp of the spleen, especially in the germinal centers and in Peyer's patches in the intestine wall (data not shown) suggesting that high levels ofPARP-1 and -2 expression are related to proliferation of immature lymphocytes. At E18.5, PARP-1 was preferentially expressed in specific brain regions (see the olfactory bulb, cerebellar, and cerebral cortex in Fig. 1, D–F) and in the olfactory epithelia. Expression was also higher in the cranial and spinal ganglia. PARP-2 expression appeared more homogeneous in craniofacial tissues, although it was slightly up-regulated in brain and cranial/spinal ganglia. In the adult brain (Fig. 1, J–L), both PARP-1 (28Pieper A.A. Blackshaw S. Clements E.E. Brat D.J. Krug D.K. White A.J. Pinto-Garcia P. Favit A. Conover J.R. Snyder S.H. Verma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1845-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and PARP-2 genes showed high expression in neuronal cells forming the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus and the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus (CA 1–3). Weaker expression was detected in cells of the cerebral cortex. Only PARP-1, however, was expressed at high levels in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum (data not shown). It is in testis that the expression pattern of PARP-1 andPARP-2 is the most distinct. PARP-1 is expressed at high levels in the seminiferous tubules of the developing testis (Fig. 1, G–I). Expression was particularly strong in the basal layers of the seminiferous epithelium (Fig. 1, M–N, and Ref. 29Concha I.I. Figueroa J. Concha M.I. Ueda K. Burzio L.O. Exp.

In contrast, the PARP-2 signal was weak and rather homogeneous, throughout the seminiferous tubules and the interstitial tissue (Fig. 1 O). Apart from testis, the expression pattern of PARP-2resembles that of PARP-1 except that the level of expression of PARP-2 is weaker. PARP-1 is known to act as a catalytic dimer (30Bauer P.I.

To investigate possible homodimerization of PARP-2, extracts from HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid allowing the overexpression of murine PARP-2 (mPARP-2) in fusion with GST were mixed with extracts from HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid allowing the expression of either mPARP-2 fused to GFP, or GFP alone (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 6, respectively). GST fusion proteins were also generated expressing truncated versions of mPARP-2 (see Fig.2): amino acids 1–69 (Nt, the DNA binding domain), amino acids 63–202 (domain E), and amino acids 203–559 (F, the catalytic domain). GST-fused proteins were trapped on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and copurifying GFP-tagged mPARP-2 was assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibody. Fig. 2 shows that PARP-2 is able to homodimerize (lane 2) through its E domain (lane 4). To further investigate the possibility that PARP-2 forms heterodimers with PARP-1 and to prevent any cross-reaction with PARP-2, we immunoprecipitated PARP-1 from HeLa cell extracts using the F1.23-specific monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal part of PARP-1 (32Lamarre D. Talbot B. de Murcia G. Laplante C. Leduc Y. Mazen A. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PARP-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with PARP-1 (Fig.3 A, lane 3). A negative control using an unrelated antibody did not trap either of these two proteins (lane 2). The interaction between PARP-2 and PARP-1 was also observed (lane 4 and see Fig.5 B below) in the presence of the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), indicating that it occurs independently of their polymerizing activity.Figure 5Heteromodification of PARP-1 and PARP-2.The GST-tagged deletion mutants of mPARP-2 (A) or hPARP-1 (B) were expressed in HeLa cells, extracted by GST pull-down, and incubated 4 min at 25 °C in activity buffer with or without purified hPARP-1 or mPARP-2 as indicated in the presence of [32P]NAD (1 μm for control and mPARP-2, 0.1 μm for hPARP-1) and DNase I activated DNA.

To map the interaction domain within PARP-1, GST fusion proteins were generated expressing truncated versions of hPARP-1 (Fig. 4 A): amino acids 1–371 (A–C, the DNA binding domain), amino acids 174–366 (B and C), amino acids 384–524 (D, encompassing the BRCT domain), amino acids 572–1014 (F, encompassing the catalytic domain), and amino acids 525–655 (region E). These fusion proteins were overexpressed in HeLa cells, and GST pull-down experiments were performed followed by Western blot analyses. Copurification of endogenous PARP-2 was efficient with constructs containing either the DNA binding domain (lane 2) or the BRCT domain (lane 4). These domains are those involved in the homodimerization of PARP-1 (Fig. 4 A and Ref.30Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Hakam A. Kun E. Biochem.

Each nucleosome consists of ∼148 bp DNA wrapping around a core histone octamer, which includes two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar). The packaging of DNA generally creates a repressive environment for gene expression; therefore, transcriptional activation of many genes requires chromatin modifications, such as the reversible acetylation of core histones. Transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA onto the ε-amino group of various lysine residues in the NH2-terminal tails of core histones is a ubiquitous process found in all eukaryotes examined. The steady state level of acetylation is controlled by the competing activities of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs).1 In general, hypoacetylated chromatin is associated with gene silencing, whereas hyperacetylation correlates with gene activation (2Loidl P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Roth S.Y. Denu J.M.

However, recent studies have shown that histone deacetylation can also play a significant role in transcriptional activation. For example, inhibition of HDACs by trichostatin A or trapoxin both activates and silences a small fraction of cellular genes in mammalian cells (6Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, mutation of the yeast histone deacetylases RPD3and SIN3 shows that both genes are required to fully activate or to repress specific promoters (6Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L.

Finally, there is increasing evidence to support the idea that acetylation/deacetylation of non-histone proteins may also function in activation as well as repression of transcription (11Luo J., Su, F.

Since the discovery of histone deacetylase RPD3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, numerous HDACs have been identified in mammalian cells, and are grouped into three classes based on sequence homologies. Members of the class I include RPD3 and its related proteins HDAC1–3 and 8 (15Buggy J.J. Sideris M.L. Mak P. Lorimer D.D. McIntosh B. Clark J.M. Biochem.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These enzymes have ∼400–500 amino acids and are primarily located in the nucleus. The class II histone deacetylases consist of proteins that closely resemble the yeast HDA1 protein, including HDAC4–7 (20Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 21Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this class are larger proteins (∼1000 amino acids), whose catalytic domains are located in the COOH terminus of the peptide with the exception of HDAC6, which contains a duplicate of the catalytic region in its NH2 terminus as well (20Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the recently identified class II member, HDAC10, harbors an amino-terminal catalytic domain as well as a carboxyl pseudo-repeat that shares significant homology with its catalytic domain (22Kao H.Y. Lee C.H. Komarov A. Han C.C. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the deacetylase function for each domain is yet to be determined. Finally, the yeast SIR2 protein and its homologues form the third class. These enzymes contain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent activities that are insensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (23Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M.

Factors that interact with class II HDACs include transcriptional corepressor CtBP, proteins of the 14-3-3 family as well as MEF2 transcription factors, which are involved in muscle differentiation (for review, see Ref. 33Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The presence of different HDACs in distinctive complexes with different transcription regulators presumably contribute to their diverse biological activities. In the present study, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a novel human histone deacetylase, HDAC11. Our data suggest that HDAC11 is a unique member of the family that is expressed in specific tissues and certain cancer cell lines. The enzyme localizes primarily to the nucleus and interacts with HDAC6 in vivo. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and the Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science (Boston, MA). Rediprime DNA labeling kit, Hybond-P membrane, and Hyperfilm MP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Kodak BioMAX MR film was from EASTMAN Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). Human multiple tissue Northern blot and human tissue RNA were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). PLATINUM Pfx DNA polymerase, RNaseOUT, 10 mm dNTP mixture, and pre-cast Tris glycine gels were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The RiboGreenTM kit was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). An ABI PrismTM Sequence Detection System was from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). DNA purification kits were from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). NE-PERTM Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents was purchased from Pierce. Normal dermal human fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Reverse transcription-PCR was employed to generate the HDAC11 coding region, using cDNAs synthesized from normal dermal human fibroblast. PCR primers were designed based on a primary human renal epithelial cells cDNA EST sequence (GenBankTM accession number AK025890). Restriction enzyme sites and sequences encoding the FLAG epitope were added. The primers are: forward: 5′-GAGGATCCACCATGCTACACACAACCCAGCTG-3′ (BamHI site is underlined, and the translational start site is bolded), and reverse: 5′-GCGTCTAGA CTA CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCAGCCCGGGGCACTGCAGGGGGAAG-3′ (the XbaI site is underlined, the STOP signal is in italic, and the FLAG-encoding sequences are in bold). The ∼1.1-kb PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct pcDNA3.1/HDAC11-Flag was verified by DNA sequencing. The multiple human tissue Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH. A32P-labeled probe corresponding to the HDAC11 coding region (nucleotide numbers 181 to 1122) was prepared using the Redi-prime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Northern blot was pre-hybridized and hybridized in the presence of 32P-labeled probe according to the manufacturer's protocol. A probe corresponding to human actin cDNA (CLONTECH) was used as a control for the relative amount of mRNA loaded in each lane. Total RNA from cultured cell lines were isolated with the Qiagen RNeasyTM96 kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Human tissue RNA was purchased from CLONTECH. RT-PCR was performed on an ABI PrismTM Sequence Detection System using the primers listed: HDAC11 forward, 5′-CAATGGGCATGAGCGAGAC-3′ and HDAC11 reverse, 5′-TGTGGCGGTTGTAGACATCC-3′. Ten ng of total RNA were added to a 25-μl reaction in a Taqman Reaction System (Eurogentec) according to the manufacturer's protocol, which was also supplemented with 0.25 units/μl reverse transcriptase (MultiScribe ABI) and 0.08 units/μl RNase inhibitor (RNaseOUT, Invitrogen). The reverse transcription of mRNA was initiated with a 5-min incubation at 48 °C followed by a 10-min incubation at 95 °C to inactivate the reverse transcriptase and simultaneously activate the thermostable DNA polymerase. The two-step PCR reaction with alternating 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C lasted 50 cycles. The ABI sequence detection software (version 1.6.3) and MicrosoftTM Excel were used to calculate the quantities of mRNAs. The RT-PCR assays were standardized with different dilutions of total RNA isolated from A549 lung tumor cells. Total amount of RNA in each reaction was quantified in a fluorometric assay using the RiboGreenTM kit from Molecular Probes Inc. according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 5 × 106 293 cells were grown in a 15-cm2 plate (∼50% confluent) on the day of transfection. GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to transfect 30 μg of plasmid DNA per plate of cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min on a rotator, followed by spinning at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The soluble supernatant was collected and used for immunoprecipitation with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. As a negative control, 1 ml of lysis buffer was used instead of the cell lysate. The immunoprecipitated complex was pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, four times with lysis buffer containing 1 mNaCl, and three times with 1 ml of HDAC assay buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The immunoprecipitated complex was suspended in 30 μl of HDAC assay buffer containing 30,000 cpm of the acetylated histone H4 peptide. Histone deacetylase activity was determined after incubation at 37 °C for 3 h as described (16Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C., Al Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). For inhibition studies, the immunoprecipitated complex was preincubated with trapoxin (200 nm) for 20 min on ice. Forty-eight hours after transfection, 293 cells were lysed as described above. For immunoprecipitation with anti-HDAC6 (H-300) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech), the lysate was pre-cleared with 30 μl of protein G plus/protein A-agarose suspension (Oncogene) for 2 h at 4 °C. The lysate was incubated with 2 μg of anti-HDAC6 (H-300) antibody and 30 μl of protein G plus/protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. For immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, 20 μl of the affinity gel was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1m NaCl, and once more with lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated on 10% Tris glycine gels, transferred onto Hybond-P membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitated protein complexes were separated on Tris glycine gels by electrophoresis and transferred onto the Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride memberane. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies diluted in TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence on BioMAX MR films. Anti-FLAG rabbit antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Anti-HDAC6 (S-14) (Santa Cruz) was diluted 1:200. Anti-mSin3A (Santa Cruz) was diluted 1:1,000. Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Upstate Technologies, Lake Placid, NY) and anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Whole cell lysates were prepared from transfected 293 cells as described above. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using NE-PERTM nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of total protein from each preparation were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody for detection of HDAC11-FLAG fusion proteins. To identify additional members of the HDAC family, we performed BLASTTM searches against GenBankTM and dbEST data bases using the yeast HOS3 protein (34Carmen A.A. Griffin P.R. Calaycay J.R. Rundlett S.E. Suka Y. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12356-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as the query sequence. The HOS3 protein is a unique member of the HDAC family. It contains functional deacetylase motifs that are shared by both class I and class II eukaryotic HDACs, as well as the prokaryotic HDAC-like proteins, which include the acetoin utilization proteins (AcuCs) (36Leipe D.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases (APAHs) (36Leipe D.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), yet it is not grouped into any of the three HDAC classes. Our homology searches reveal a cDNA sequence in primary human renal epithelial cells (GenBankTM accession number AK025890) that potentially encodes a novel histone deacetylase, which we designate as HDAC11. In addition, we have identified putative HDAC11 orthologues inMus musculus (accession number BC016208, 91% identical to human), Drosophila melanogaster (accession number CG10899, 52% identical to human), and Arabidopsis thaliana(accession number AF149413, 51% identical to human) based on sequence homologies at the amino acid level (data not shown). The predicted human HDAC11 amino acid sequence reveals an open reading frame of 347 residues with a corresponding molecular mass of 39 kDa (Fig.1 A). Searches of genomic data bases indicate that the HDAC11 gene is located on human chromosome 3p25.2, spanning ∼25-kb in length. It contains 9 exons and 8 introns, as predicted by spliced junction sites (data not shown). Sequence comparisons at the amino acid level show that HDAC11, over the entire length of the protein, is only slightly homologous to the existing HDAC family members, including the yeast HOS3 protein. However, HDAC11 contains all nine blocks of conserved sequences that are potentially important for the deacetylase function (Fig. 1 B) (20Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Furthermore, alignment of HDAC11 with other members of the HDAC family reveal a putative catalytic core region that includes almost all of the invariant active site residues shared by the eukaryotic HDACs as well as the prokaryotic HDAC-like proteins (Fig. 1 B) (37Finnin M.S.

These findings suggest that the newly identified cDNA might encode a protein that possesses histone deacetylase enzymatic activity.Figure 1A, nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the human HDAC11 cDNA clone.

The polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is in bold face and italic. B, multiple sequence alignment of HDAC11 with other HDACs and HDAC-like proteins. HDAC11 contains all nine blocks of sequences conserved in other eukaryotic histone deacetylases and the prokaryotic AcuC hydrolases and acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases (36Leipe D.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Active site residues involved in catalysis, metal chelation, and ligand binding, as shown in the crystal structure of the bacterial HDAC-like protein, are marked with a black dot (●). The human proteins are preceded byh, the yeast proteins are preceded by y, the prokaryotic proteins are preceded by pro, and theDrosophila protein is preceded by a d.

These analyses reveal two HDAC11 transcripts in human tissues. One is ∼1.7 kb, which agrees with the estimated size of the human cDNA clone; the other is ∼3.2 kb and appears to be expressed more abundantly (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, additional GenBankTM search identified a 3160-bp Macac fascicularis (primate, akacrab-eating macaque) brain cDNA (accession number AB052134) that shared extensive homology with the human cDNA. Therefore, the longer transcript we observed on the Northern blot might represent the human homologue of the macaque cDNA. Sequence alignment of the two cDNAs show that although the macaque cDNA contains additional nucleotides in both the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, the predicted macaque polypeptide is almost identical to that of the human (only 3 conservative amino acid substitutions), missing just the first 28 amino acids (Fig. 2 B). This finding suggests that the two transcripts seen on the Northern blot are probably the result of alternative gene splicing. Furthermore, Northern analyses indicate that the overall expression level of HDAC11 mRNA is low in many human tissues and that the high expression level is limited to brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig. 2 A). On the contrary, previous reports have shown that many members of the histone deacetylase family are ubiquitously expressed (20Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 35Hu E. Chen Z. Fredrickson T. Zhu Y. Kirkpatrick R. Zhang G.F. Johanson K. Sung C.M. Liu R. Winkler J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, we envision that HDAC11's function may be tissue-specific. Real-time PCR technique was also employed to examine HDAC11 expression in normal human tissues and eight human cancer cell lines. These experiments confirm findings of the Northern analyses; in addition, they reveal high expression levels of HDAC11 mRNA in testis (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, our data show that large amounts of HDAC11 transcripts are found in four cancer cell lines, most notably, a rhabdomyosarcoma muscle tumor line (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these results suggest that HDAC11 may function not only in normal human tissues, but also in the development and/or maintenance of certain human cancers. To determine whether HDAC11 possesses histone deacetylase activity, we expressed HDAC11 as a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged fusion protein (Fig.3 A) in 293 cells, which is detected on Western blots as a ∼39-kDa protein using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3 B). Using the same antibody, we immunoprecipitated the HDAC11-FLAG fusion protein and performedin vitro histone deacetylase assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). These experiments show that the immune complex from cells transfected with HDAC11-FLAG expression vector contains 2–3-fold higher enzymatic activity than that from cells transfected with the empty vector alone (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, as previously reported for many other HDACs, HDAC11's enzymatic activity is inhibited by trapoxin, a known histone deacetylase inhibitor (Fig.3 D). These results demonstrate that HDAC11 is a functional enzyme with histone deacetylase activity. Previous studies have shown that both class I and class II HDACs function in large protein complexes that include many transcription repressors/corepressors and other HDAC members (20Grozinger C.M.

To determine whether HDAC11 participates in similar complexes, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Our results indicate that unlike the class I and class II HDACs, HDAC11 does not associate with mSin3A (Fig. 4 A), RbAp48, N-CoR, or SMART in vivo (data not shown), suggesting that HDAC11 is probably biochemically distinct from the existing HDACs. Interestingly, we find that HDAC6, which is also highly expressed in kidney and testis (20Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), 2F. Asselbergs, unpublished data.coimmunoprecipitates with HDAC11 (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the reciprocal experiments show that the anti-HDAC6 antibody is able to coimmunoprecipitate the HDAC11-FLAG fusion protein (Fig.4 C). Therefore, these two HDAC members probably associate with common proteins or each other in vivo. No previous protein-protein interactions have been demonstrated for HDAC6, whose biological activity is still largely unknown. It has been shown that some members of the histone deacetylase family localize exclusively to the nucleus (16Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C., Al Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), whereas others shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (26Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 29Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Curr.

Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). To examine the subcellular localization of HDAC11 protein, we transfected 293 cells with the HDAC11-FLAG expression vector and performed cell fractionation studies. Our data shows that the HDAC11-FLAG fusion protein is found in the whole cell lysates and the nuclear extracts, but not in the cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 5). As expected, we also detect the endogenous HDAC1 protein in the same nuclear extract preparation. Therefore, we conclude that HDAC11 proteins are located mostly in the nuclei. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of a new human histone deacetylase, HDAC11. We have shown that, when expressed in mammalian cells, the cloned cDNA lead to production of an active HDAC enzyme. Furthermore, the HDAC11 mRNA is abundantly expressed in specific normal human tissues as well as several cancer cell lines. Finally, we have demonstrated that the HDAC11 protein resides in the nucleus and is found in protein complexes with another HDAC family member, HDAC6. The histone deacetylase family is a large and expanding family with the recent additions of human HDAC9 (42Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and HDAC10 (22Kao H.Y. Lee C.H. Komarov A. Han C.C. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Together with the prokaryotic HDAC-like proteins AcuCs and APAHs, eukaryotic HDACs are members of an ancient protein superfamily (36Leipe D.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the eubacterium protein Bacillus subtilis AcuC and the proteobacterium protein Mycoplana ramosa APAH may have diverged from a common ancestor and subsequently evolved to give rise to the eukaryotic class I and class II HDACs, respectively (20Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). HDAC11 is the smallest member of the HDAC family discovered so far and the entire protein contains mostly the catalytic domain. Similarly, the prokaryotic HDAC-like proteins AcuC and APAH are relatively small enzymes whose catalytic domains span their entire sequences (36Leipe D.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Analyses of the conserved active site residues as well as phylogenetic studies (Fig. 1 C) indicate that HDAC11 is more closely related to the prokaryotic AcuC protein and the class I eukaryotic HDACs than to the APAH protein and class II HDACs. Furthermore, these findings suggest that together with AcuC, APAH, and the yeast HOS3 protein, HDAC11 might have diverged early in evolution and thus more closely related to the common ancestral gene(s) from which the eukaryotic HDACs evolved. The COOH-terminal FLAG-tagged HDAC11 fusion protein, when expressed in 293 cells, possesses HDAC activity that is active on a synthetic peptide derived from the NH2-terminal domain of histone H4. Compared with activities of other HDAC members in the same in vitro enzyme assay, HDAC11's activity is much lower (data not shown). However, we have found that the HDAC11-FLAG fusion protein is expressed at a lower amount compared with all other FLAG-tagged HDAC members we have examined; thus, the reduced in vitroactivity does not necessarily imply that HDAC11 is a weaker HDAC. Furthermore, the activity is measured in an in vitro assay using a synthetic peptide that might not be the endogenous substrate(s)in vivo. These may include other histones as well as non-histone proteins. It is possible that HDAC6, due to its association with HDAC11 in vivo, is contributing to the observedin vitro enzymatic activities. However, HDAC6's enzymatic activity is highly resistant to trapoxin (43Furumai R. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), whereas the activity derived from immunoprecipitated HDAC11 is completely inhibited at 200 nm. Therefore, we conclude that HDAC11 is a bona fide histone deacetylase. Based on results of this and other similar studies, we hope that the availability of this new HDAC will permit development of more selective HDAC inhibitors with possible beneficial pharmaceutical properties. Unlike the class I HDAC enzymes, which are ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, expression of HDAC11 mRNA is limited to brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis, suggesting that its function might be tissue-specific. Interestingly, we have found an extremely high level of HDAC11 mRNA in several human cancer cell lines. Preliminary studies suggest that the aberrant expression is not due to gene amplification, but rather a result of deregulation of HDAC11 gene expression.2 It is tempting to speculate that misregulation of HDAC11 gene expression may contribute to carcinogenesis and/or metastasis in certain human cancers. We have observed two HDAC11 transcripts on Northern blots, most likely a result of alternative gene splicing. The larger transcript, which might encode an NH2-terminal truncated protein, appears to be expressed more abundantly in normal human tissues. It will be interesting to examine whether the truncated HDAC11 protein contains histone deacetylase activity and whether it is the predominant form in vivo. An antibody against the endogenous HDAC11 protein will aid in addressing these questions. It has been widely accepted that HDACs modulate transcriptional gene expression at specific promoters by associating with transcriptional corepressors, often in large protein complexes (26Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Most of the evidence on the role of HDACs in vivo has been pieced together by studying the interacting partners. Immunoprecipitation experiments of epitope-tagged HDAC11 suggest that, in contrast to class I and class II HDACs, HDAC11 does not associate with the mSin3A or the SMRT·N-CoR complex. Interestingly, we find that virtually all of the HDAC11 in vivo is present in a protein complex that can be immunoprecipitated by the HDAC6 antibody (Fig. 4 C). HDAC6 is a unique member of the class II enzymes that contains two catalytic domains. Unlike other members of the class II, such as HDAC4 and HDAC5, HDAC6 has not been found in protein complexes containing HDAC3 or RbAp48. It has been suggested that HDAC6 may not interact with histonesin vivo, but rather may deacetylate other substrates (20Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Its precise biological function has not been established. We speculate that both HDAC11 and HDAC6 may utilize non-histone proteins as their substrates; they may exist in a distinctive protein complex from the known co-repressor complexes and play roles other than to directly modulate chromatin structure. Further studies of HDAC11 will not only provide information on its biological functions but also potentially shed some light on HDAC6's mechanism of action. We thank members of the D. Cohen and Atadja laboratories for critical discussions of the manuscript and their support."

Signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase is complex and includes mitogen-activated protein kinases and p70S6 kinase, in addition to Akt, and appears to modulate many important cell processes including cell metabolism and growth (13Coffer P.J.

Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and recent work suggests it plays a similar role in the mammalian heart (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The downstream pathways responsible for controlling cardiomyocyte size have not been identified. Activation of PI 3-kinase leads to D3 phosphorylation of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, some of which is converted to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-trisphosphate by an inositol phosphatase (17Damen J.E.

Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate accumulate in the cell membrane and recruit Akt and PDK1 to the cell membrane by binding to their pleckstrin homology domains, leading to phosphorylation and activation of Akt (18Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Because PDK1 is constitutively active, movement of Akt to the sarcolemmal membrane is sufficient to lead to its activation. For this reason, incorporation of the src myristoylation signal creates a constitutively active Akt mutant (10Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T. Hajjar R. Rosenzweig A.

The relative contribution of these downstream effectors in mediating the cardiac effects of Akt remains undefined. To examine the effects of chronic Akt activation in the heart, we generated transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Akt (myr-Akt). Mice demonstrated a broad spectrum of phenotypes from sudden death with massive cardiac enlargement to cardiac hypertrophy with preserved systolic function and protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Two viable lines have been bred for five generations and characterized more fully. These lines should provide a valuable tool for investigating the effects of Akt activation in chronic models of cardiac disease. The cDNA encoding HA-tagged Akt with Src myristoylation (myr) signal (kindly provided by Dr. Thomas F. Franke, Columbia University) was subcloned downstream of the 5.5-kb murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter (generously given by Dr. Jeffrey Robbins, Division of Molecular Cardiovascular Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation (28Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and used to generate transgenic mice through oocyte injection. Positive founders were identified by Southern blotting and bred to wild-type C57BL6 mice. Hearts from 8–16-week old mice were removed from deeply anesthetized animals, snap frozen, and crushed in liquid nitrogen before tissue was homogenized in cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions on 12% separation gels with a 4% stacking gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies to HA (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Akt (Cell Signaling), phospho-Akt (Ser-473, Cell Signaling), ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), GSK-3β (Transduction Lab), phospho-GSK-3β (Cell Signaling), SAPK/JNK (Cell Signaling), p38 (Cell Signaling), phospho-p70S6 kinase (Cell Signaling), and p70S6 kinase (Cell Signaling) for 18–20 h at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and signal detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling). Akt Kinase Assay—Myocardial tissue was lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt antibody, and used to measure Akt kinase activity using the Akt Kinase Assay Kit (Cell Signaling) with GSK-3α/β as substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. These kinase activities were measured with the SAPK/JNK and p38 kinase Assay Kits (Cell Signaling) using c-Jun and ATF-2 as substrates for SAPK/JNK and p38, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Kinase activity of GSK-3β was measured as described previously (29Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen hearts were homogenized and lysed in the lysis buffer. GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated with anti-GSK-3β monoclonal antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads. After the beads were washed, the immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in reaction mixture containing 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm glycogen synthase peptide-2 (Upstate) as substrate. The mixtures were spotted onto Whatman P81 paper, washed with 0.5% phosphoric acid, and32P measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Kinase activity was reduced to background levels when 10 mm LiCl was included in the reaction mixture, suggesting the activity measured was GSK-3β (data not shown). Lysates were prepared as above and immunoprecipitated with Ab to p70S6 kinase (Cell Signaling). The immobilized immunoprecipitates were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in reaction mixture containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 100 μm unlabeled ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 μm S6 synthetic peptide (RRLSSLRA; Alexis Biochemical) as substrate. The reaction mixtures were spotted on P81 paper and washed with 0.5% phosphoric acid. 32P incorporation into the peptide was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. For all kinase assays, samples from 8–16-week old mice were used. Tissues were snap-frozen in OCT medium, and 10-μm sections were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Morphological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue was performed using microscopy and a SONY imaging system. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated with the perfused-heart method described previously (30Nagata K., Ye, C. Jain M. Milstone D.S. Liao R. Mortensen R.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, after deeply anesthetizing the mice, hearts were quickly excised, cannulated via the aorta, and perfused in the Langendorff mode with a constant perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg. The hearts were first perfused for 5 min at 37 °C with 1.8 mm Ca2+ Tyrode (in mm: NaCl 137, KCl 5.4, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 10, and glucose 10, pH 7.4), followed by Ca2+-free Tyrode for an additional 5 min. They were then perfused with a digestion solution containing 5 mg of collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 17.5 mg of collagenase B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1.5 mg of protease XIV (Sigma) in 35 ml of Ca2+-free Tyrode. After the hearts were palpably flaccid, the digestion solution was washed out with Ca2+-free Tyrode solution for 30 s. The left ventricle (including the septum) was cut into small pieces and gently agitated, allowing the myocytes to be dispersed in Ca2+-free Tyrode. The isolated myocytes were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Using Cytospin2 (Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh), myocytes suspended with phosphate-buffered saline were placed on glass slides and stained with anti-HA Ab. The Ab was detected using Vectastain ABC-Alkaline Phosphatase kit (VECTOR Lab). Images were digitally captured, and individual cells were traced and surface areas calculated using NIH image (version 1.60). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection) and the anterior chest was shaved. Cardiac ultrasound imaging was performed in the left lateral decubitus position using a high-frequency 13.0 MHz liner transducer (Acuson Sequoia C256 with a 15L8 linear array) at a frame rate of 166 frames/s and imaging depth set at 10 mm. Estimated ejection fraction was calculated using a modified Simpson's rule. TG20 male positive and negative littermates aged 9–12 weeks were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion as previously described (12Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.-H., Li, L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Briefly, seven animals from each group were anesthetized (Avertin), intubated, and ventilated. Left thoracotomy was performed and LAD ligated with 7-0 silk. 5 min into ischemia, 50 μl of fluorescent microspheres (10-μm FluoSpheres, Molecular Probes) were injected into the LV cavity. After 30 min, the LAD ligature was released, and reperfusion visually confirmed. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after ischemia. Hearts were frozen in liquid N2, and sectioned from apex to base (Jung Frigocut 2800E, Leica) into four 2-mm sections. To delineate the infarct, sections were incubated in 5% (w/v) triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min. The area-at-risk delineated by fluorescent microspheres was visualized under UV light. For each section, the area-at-risk and infarct area were measured from enlarged digital micrographs using NIH image. %MI was calculated as the total infarction area divided by the total area-at-risk for that heart. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments and were compared using a two-tailed Student'st test. The null hypothesis was rejected atp < 0.05. Cardiac specific expression of constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt) was driven by the murine α-myocin heavy chain promoter, which produces predominantly postnatal ventricular transgene expression (28Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three transgene positive (TG+) founders (two females, one male) died suddenly with massive cardiac dilatation at ages 9–19 weeks. Two viable TG+ lines (TG564 and TG20) were derived from independent founders. Both lines exhibited Mendelian inheritance of the transgene consistent with autosomal (TG564) and X-linked (TG20) transmission stable over 5 generations (data not shown). Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to the incorporated HA epitope confirmed cardiac-specific expression (Fig.1 A). Transgene expression was comparable in TG564 male and female mice. In TG20 mice, transgene expression was greater in male compared with female mice (Fig.1 B). Immunohistochemical staining in female TG20 mice revealed that not all cardiomyocytes expressed the transgene (data not shown) consistent with the expected inactivation of the transgene-encoding X-chromosome in some cardiomyocytes. Immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody to Akt demonstrated substantial overexpression of the transgene in comparison to the endogenous molecule (Fig.1 C). Akt activity was dramatically increased as measured by an in vitro kinase assay using a synthetic GSK-3α/β fusion protein as substrate (Fig. 1 C, bottom). Hearts from transgenic mice in both lines were substantially larger than transgene negative (TG−) littermates with evident gross cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 2 and TableI). In TG564 mice, the HW/BW ratio was 2.5- and 2.1-fold greater than that seen in TG− female and male littermates (p < 0.005), respectively (Table I). TG20 had less marked cardiac hypertrophy with a HW/BW ratio 1.6- and 1.7-fold greater than that seen in TG− female and male littermates (p < 0.005), respectively.Table IHeart and body weight of TG miceNegative littermates (20 line)Negative littermates (564 line)Female (n = 8)Male (n = 9)Female (n = 9)Male (n = 8)Age (weeks)15.0 ± 1.214.5 ± 2.414.1 ± 0.714.5 ± 0.5Body weight (g)24.7 ± 0.930.4 ± 2.423.4 ± 0.930.4 ± 1.7Heart weight (mg)111.7 ± 3.5128.0 ± 3.4102.5 ± 4.8130.1 ± 0.5HW/BW (mg/g)4.5 ± 0.14.3 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.2TG20 positiveTG564 positiveFemale (n = 8)Male (n = 10)Female (n = 10)Male (n = 9)Age (weeks)16.7 ± 2.316.6 ± 1.015.8 ± 1.715.4 ± 1.3Body weight (g)25.1 ± 1.529.5 ± 1.924.5 ± 1.329.6 ± 1.7Heart weight (mg)175.3 ± 11.51-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.209.3 ± 11.81-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.268.1 ± 15.91-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.1-bp < 0.005 versusthe same gender in 20 line.262.9 ± 8.31-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.1-bp < 0.005 versusthe same gender in 20 line.HW/BW (mg/g)7.0 ± 0.41-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.7.2 ± 0.31-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.11.0 ± 0.41-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.1-bp < 0.005 versusthe same gender in 20 line.9.0 ± 0.51-ap < 0.005versus negative animals.1-bp < 0.005 versusthe same gender in 20 line.n = number of animals.

To characterize the cardiac enlargement on a cellular level, we isolated cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice and their littermates. Cardiomyocyte surface area was measured from digitized micrographs of isolated cells. TG564 myocytes were substantially larger with a mean surface area 1.7-fold greater than that seen in TG− littermates (2827 ± 30 versus 1692 ± 20 μm2,p < 0.000001) (Fig.3 A). Cardiomyocytes isolated from TG20 females revealed significant heterogeneity in size. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the larger cardiomyocytes expressed the Akt transgene, while the smaller cardiomyocytes did not (Fig. 3 B). Echocardiograms were performed in both lines from 8 to 18 weeks to assess in vivo cardiac function as well as wall and chamber dimensions. TG20 mice demonstrated LV hypertrophy that was slightly more marked for male as compared with female TG+ mice (Table II). Wall thickness in TG564 mice was comparably increased in both males and females, and similar to that seen in male TG20 mice. Systolic ventricular function (as indicated by ejection fraction) was normal in both lines (Table II).Table IIEchocardiographic finding in TG miceIVSPWEF mm %Female negative (n = 10)0.66 ± 0.030.64 ± 0.0268.0 ± 2.42-ap = not significant.Male negative (n = 15)0.73 ± 0.040.72 ± 0.0465.9 ± 1.72-ap = not significant.TG20 female positive (n = 13)0.82 ± 0.032-bp < 0.05 versusfemale negative animals.0.84 ± 0.032-bp < 0.05 versusfemale negative animals.63.8 ± 1.22-ap = not significant.TG20 male positive (n = 10)0.96 ± 0.042-cp < 0.05 versusTG20 female positive.0.98 ± 0.042-cp < 0.05 versusTG20 female positive.62.5 ± 2.82-ap = not significant.TG564 female positive (n = 9)0.97 ± 0.042-cp < 0.05 versusTG20 female positive.1.03 ± 0.032-cp < 0.05 versusTG20 female positive.62.9 ± 1.92-ap = not significant.TG564 male positive (n = 8)0.94 ± 0.052-cp < 0.05 versusTG20 female positive.0.92 ± 0.062-cp < 0.05 versusTG20 female positive.62.0 ± 2.42-ap = not significant.n = number of animals.

Several signaling pathways relevant to cardiac hypertrophy were examined. We observed no change in the level of total extracellular regulated kinases (ERK)-1 and 2, or phosphorylated ERK-1 and –2 (Fig.4 A). Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) has also been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy bothin vitro (31Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and in vivo (32Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Fry S. del Monte F. Haq S. Guerrero J. Picard M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there was no difference between SAPK activity in TG+ and TG− mice (Fig. 4 B). We measured phosphorylation of p38 and p38 kinase activity with ATF-2 as substrate. Although occasional TG+ mice showed modestly enhanced phosphorylation of p38, most did not (data not shown). Moreover, p38 activity was similar between TG+ and TG− mice (Fig. 4 C). GSK-3β is phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt (33Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). GSK-3β inactivation is required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to some stimuli in vitro (29Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J.

Similarly, there was no difference in activity (Fig. 4 D, lower panel). The ribosomal protein p70S6 kinase is another downstream target of Akt (34Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S.

https://openalex.org/W2018924297,"Alström syndrome is a homogeneous autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by childhood obesity associated with hyperinsulinemia, chronic hyperglycemia and neurosensory deficits. The gene involved in Alström syndrome probably interacts with genetic modifiers, as subsets of affected individuals present with additional features such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hepatic dysfunction, hypothyroidism, male hypogonadism, short stature and mild to moderate developmental delay, and with secondary complications normally associated with type 2 diabetes, such as hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Our detection of an uncharacterized transcript, KIAA0328, led us to identify the gene ALMS1, which contains sequence variations, including four frameshift mutations and two nonsense mutations, that segregate with Alström syndrome in six unrelated families. ALMS1 is ubiquitously expressed at low levels and does not share significant sequence homology with other genes reported so far. The identification of ALMS1 provides an entry point into a new pathway leading toward the understanding of both Alström syndrome and the common diseases that characterize it."
https://openalex.org/W2138681651,"Cyclophilin A (CyPA), a ubiquitously distributed intracellular protein, is a peptidylprolylcis-trans-isomerase and the major target of the potent immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. Although expressed predominantly as an intracellular molecule, CyPA is secreted by cells in response to inflammatory stimuli and is a potent neutrophil and eosinophil chemoattractant in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms underlying CyPA-mediated signaling and chemotaxis are unknown. Here, we identified CD147 as a cell surface receptor for CyPA and demonstrated that CD147 is an essential component in the CyPA-initiated signaling cascade that culminates in ERK activation. Both signaling and chemotactic activities of CyPA depended also on the presence of heparans, which served as primary binding sites for CyPA on target cells. The proline 180 and glycine 181 residues in the extracellular domain of CD147 were critical for signaling and chemotactic activities mediated by CD147. Also crucial were active site residues of CyPA, because rotamase-defective CyPA mutants failed to initiate signaling events. These results establish cyclophilins as natural ligands for CD147 and suggest an unusual, rotamase-dependent mechanism of signaling.

It also elicits an inflammatory response characterized by a rapid influx of neutrophils when injected in vivo (7Xu Q. Leiva M.C. Fischkoff S.A. Handschumacher R.E. Lyttle C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11968-11971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intercellular effector activities of CyPA imply the presence of a binding protein (receptor) to transduce the signal to the target cell. Binding sites have been described for other members of the cyclophilin family, cyclophilins B (CyPB) and C (CyPC) (9Denys A. Allain F. Carpentier M. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Friedman J. Trahey M. Weissman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6815-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For CyPB, two types of binding sites have been identified. The type I sites correspond to specific functional receptors that mediate internalization of bound CyPB, and the type II sites are represented by sulfated glycosaminoglycans (9Denys A. Allain F. Carpentier M. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both sites appear to be specific for CyPB because affinity of CyPC for the type I sites was 6-fold lower than that of CyPB, and CyPA did not interact with these sites at all (9Denys A. Allain F. Carpentier M. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Carpentier M. Allain F. Haendler B. Denys A. Mariller C. Benaissa M. Spik G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We reported recently that CyPB can signal through CD147, a type 1 integral membrane protein also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) (12Yurchenko V. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 786-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is unlikely, however, that CD147 is the type I binding site described by Denys and colleagues (9Denys A. Allain F. Carpentier M. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) because unlike type I receptor, CD147 was shown to interact with CyPA (13Pushkarsky T. Zybarth G. Dubrovsky L. Yurchenko V. Tang H. Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6360-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In that case, interaction was observed between CD147 and CyPA associated with HIV-1 virions and was found to enhance HIV-1 infection at a step of entry or uncoating (13Pushkarsky T. Zybarth G. Dubrovsky L. Yurchenko V. Tang H. Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6360-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Sherry B. Zybarth G. Alfano M. Dubrovsky L. Mitchell R. Rich D. Ulrich P. Bucala R. Cerami A. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1758-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Neither CyPA nor CyPC was able to inhibit CyPB binding to type II sites (glycosaminoglycan) (9Denys A. Allain F. Carpentier M. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a recent report demonstrated binding of CyPA to heparan sulfates, a subtype of glycosaminoglycans (15Saphire A.C. Bobardt M.D. Gallay P.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6771-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that CyPA and CyPB use different classes of glycosaminoglycan molecules for binding or that the affinity of CyPA for glycosaminoglycan is much lower than that of CyPB. In the case of CyPB, binding to the type II site (glycosaminoglycan) is believed to present the immunophilin for interaction with the type I site (11Carpentier M. Allain F. Haendler B. Denys A. Mariller C. Benaissa M. Spik G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Anticipating a similar arrangement for CyPA, we searched for a signaling receptor that mediated intercellular effector activities of CyPA. These studies identified CD147 as a protein responsible for CyPA-induced signaling and chemotactic activities. These signaling events also required the presence of heparans on the cell surface and depended on active site residues of CyPA. An expressed sequence tag identified as human CyPA (16Adams M.D. Dubnick M. Kerlavage A.R. Moreno R. Kelley J.M. Utterback T.R. Nagle J.W. Fields C. Venter J.C. Nature. 1992; 355: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) was obtained from ATCC (ATCC 78809D).In vitro translation and sequencing confirmed that this sequence represented a full-length CyPA cDNA (essentially homologous to GenBank Y00052). The sequence was cloned into the vector pAS2-1 (CLONTECH) to generate plasmid pAS2-1-CyPA encoding CyPA-GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein. This plasmid was used as a bait to screen a human B cell cDNA library (from S. Fields, SUNY at Stony Brook, NY) constructed in pSE1107 encoding the GAL4 activation domain (library complexity ≈108). Screening was performed using Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 2 (CLONTECH) essentially as suggested by the manufacturer. In control experiments, pAS2-1-CyPA did not activate transcription from the GAL4 promoter (measured as β-galactosidase activity) when introduced alone into yeast reporter host strains (Y187 or Y190) or when cotransformed with an empty GAL4 activation domain vector (pACT2, CLONTECH) (negative controls). A strong positive signal was detected when pAS2-1-CyPA was cotransformed with a pGAD424-glycosaminoglycan construct (expressing a fusion between the full-length HIV-1 gag protein and GAL4 activation domain (17Luban J. Bossolt K.L. Franke E.K. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar)) (positive control). The actual screening was performed by cotransforming pAS2-1-CyPA together with pSE1107-cell library into yeast reporter host strain Y190. To select for cotransformants in which the two proteins interact, the culture was plated on triple dropout plates (synthetic dropout/-His/-Trp/-Leu), and colonies were tested for expression of the lacZ reporter gene by a filter assay protocol. All blue colonies were screened further by cycloheximide counterselection according to the supplied (CLONTECH) protocol to identify false positives. Plasmids from true positive colonies were isolated and their inserts sequenced. The wild-type CHO-K1 and heparan-deficient CHOpgsB-618 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. The antibodies to p42/44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and SAPK/JNK were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); anti-CD147 and anti-CD8 mAbs were purchased from Ancell (Bayport, MN), and anti-heparan sulfate mAb was purchased from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). Heparitinase I (cleaves heparan sulfate at α-N-acetylglucosaminide-d-glucuronic acid linkage), heparitinase II (cleaves heparin sulfate and heparin), and heparitinase III (cleaves heparin at α-N-acetylglucosaminide-l-iduronic acid linkage) were purchased from Seikagaku America. Human CyPA was cloned into the pET14b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified using His-Bind methodology (Novagen) as described (14Sherry B. Zybarth G. Alfano M. Dubrovsky L. Mitchell R. Rich D. Ulrich P. Bucala R. Cerami A. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1758-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for CyPA mutants CyPAm4, F60A, F113A, W121A, and H126A were described earlier (15Saphire A.C. Bobardt M.D. Gallay P.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6771-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Braaten D. Ansari H. Luban J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2107-2113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transient and stable expression in CHO cells, a DNA fragment encoding the full-length CD147 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). For solution binding studies, a DNA fragment encoding full-length CD147 without the signal peptide was cloned into the pT7Blue2 vector (Novagen) and expressed using the troponin T (TnT) Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI). For fluorescent labeling of recombinant human CyPA the Alexa™488 Protein Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 50 μl of 1 m bicarbonate was added to 0.5 ml of a 2 mg/ml solution of recombinant human CyPA, and the entire mixture was then added to a vial of reactive Alexa dye (Alexa 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, dilithium salt). Labeling was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature, and then the reaction was terminated by adding hydroxylamine and stirring for additional 30 min. Fluorescently labeled CyPA was purified away from unreacted dye by gel filtration. The final molar ratio of dye to protein was 0.97. For binding assays with Alexa 488-labeled CyPA, cells were harvested with 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed with PBS, and the pellet was resuspended in binding buffer at 6 × 106 cells/ml. 3.5 × 105 cells were aliquoted into 6-ml Falcon tubes, mixed with appropriate volumes of labeled CyPA, and incubated on ice for 45 min. At that time 4 ml of PBS was added to each tube, and the cells were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and analyzed immediately for cell-associated fluorescence by flow cytometry. Iodination of CyPA and CyPAm4 was performed usingN-succinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-[125I]diiodophenyl)propionate (diiodinated Bolton-Hunter reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activities of wild-type and mutant CyPA used in all binding experiments were 280 and 300 Ci/mmol, respectively. For binding experiments with iodinated CyPA, cells were plated in 24- (2 × 105 cells/well) or 48-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and allowed to adhere firmly for 18 h before performing the binding experiment. Cells were incubated with 130 nm iodinated cyclophilin in a binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% BSA and 0.09% azide) for 3 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 1% SDS), and then counted in a gamma counter (Gamma Track 1193, TM Analytic, Brandon, FL). Nonspecific background binding was determined by counting radioactivity bound in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled CyPA. CyPA or BSA (150 μm each) was activated by incubating with a biotin-containing trifunctional cross-linking reagent (Sulfo-SBED, Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After removal of unincorporated cross-linker by gel filtration on D-Salt Dextran Desaltic column (Pierce), activated CyPA or BSA was affinity purified on a monomeric avidin column (Pierce) to remove unreacted protein molecules. Activated purified CyPA or BSA was then incubated with CHO.pcDNA (CHO) or CHO.CD147 cells at 4 °C for 45 min in the dark. After UV cross-linking (15 min, 365 nm), cells were washed twice with PBS at room temperature, lysed, and biotin-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose (30 min, room temperature). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBS and analyzed by Western blotting on nonreducing or reducing (β-mercaptoethanol-containing) SDS-gels using anti-CD147 monoclonal antibody (RDI, Flanders, NJ) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Neutrophils were obtained from heparinized venous blood by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation, as described (5Sherry B. Yarlett N. Strupp A. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Neutrophil chemotaxis was assessed in a 48-well modified Boyden chamber (19Boyden S. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 115: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) with the two compartments separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with a 5-μm pore size (Whatman Nuclepore, Tewksbury, MA). Neutrophils (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) in Gey's balanced salt solution supplemented with 2% BSA and 20 mm HEPES (GBSA) were added to the compartment above the filter, and test samples of possible chemoattractants diluted in chemotaxis medium were present below the filters. Chambers were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2for 30 min; then the filters were recovered, fixed, and stained with Giemsa reagent. The number of cells appearing on the lower face of the filter was recorded in four high power fields for each well, and each experimental condition was assayed in triplicate wells. 10−7m formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was used as a positive control. To control for chemokinetic activity, CyPA was added to both chambers. CHO.pcDNA and CHO.CD147 cells were assayed for chemotaxis in a manner identical to that described for neutrophil chemotaxis except that the two wells were separated by a 10-μm pore size filter (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml fibronectin for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2), and the chambers were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4.5 h. Mobilization of intracellular calcium in CyPA-stimulated cells was assessed as described by Sherryet al. (14Sherry B. Zybarth G. Alfano M. Dubrovsky L. Mitchell R. Rich D. Ulrich P. Bucala R. Cerami A. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1758-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.6 ml of Fura-2/AM-loaded cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with 100–500 nm human CyPA per sample, and fluorescence emission at 340 and 380 nm was measured on a PerkinElmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B. Serum-starved CHO cells transiently or stably transfected with pcDNA or CD147 constructs were treated with 50–500 nm CyPA. Cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting analysis using antibodies specific for the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK MAP kinases following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Previous studies demonstrated a chemotactic activity of CyPA for neutrophils, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes (5Sherry B. Yarlett N. Strupp A. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7Xu Q. Leiva M.C. Fischkoff S.A. Handschumacher R.E. Lyttle C.R. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 2714-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of a CyPA receptor on target cells. To identify potential binding partners of CyPA, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with a B cell cDNA library. Preliminary screening yielded 1 × 106 positive cDNA clones, of which 10 clones were identified as true positives after several rounds of screening (see “Materials and Methods”) and sequenced. Two of the clones carried an insert, which was 97% identical in its sequenced 5′ 186 nucleotides to human EMMPRIN cDNA (20DeCastro R. Zhang Y. Guo H. Kataoka H. Gordon M.K. Toole B. Biswas G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1260-1265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We selected EMMPRIN for further analysis because it was the only transmembrane protein among CyPA-interacting clones, which made it a good candidate for the role of CyPA receptor. Consistent with this hypothesis, our recent report demonstrated that EMMPRIN stimulates HIV-1 infection by mediating activity of virus-incorporated CyPA (13Pushkarsky T. Zybarth G. Dubrovsky L. Yurchenko V. Tang H. Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6360-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). EMMPRIN is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein of 50–60 kDa expressed on a wide variety of cells including hemopoietic, microglial, endothelial, and peripheral blood cells (21Wimazal F. Ghannadan M. Muller M.R. End A. Willheim M. Meidlinger P. Schernthaner G.H. Jordan J.H. Hagen W. Agis H. Sperr W.R. Czerwenka K. Lechner K. Valent P.

At the Sixth International Workshop and Conference of Human Leukocyte Antigens it was designated as CD147 antigen (26Stockinger H. Ebel T. Hansmann C. Koch C. Majdic O. Prager E. Patel D.D. Fox D.A. Horejsi V. Sagawa K. Shen D.-C. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Borne A.E.G. Goyert S.M. Mason D. Miyasaka M. Moretta L. Okumura K. Shaw S. Springer T. Sugamura K. Zola H. Leucocyte Typing VI. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1997: 760-766Google Scholar) and will be referred to as such in this report. Because CD147 is expressed naturally as an integral membrane protein, we used whole cell binding assay to demonstrate specific binding interactions between CyPA and CD147. Because CD147 is expressed on most cell types, we employed CHO cells transfected with a vector expressing human CD147 as target cells. We first compared binding of fluorescently labeled CyPA to CHO.CD147 cells and to control CHO cells transfected with the empty vector (CHO.pcDNA). To our surprise, CyPA bound almost equally to both cell types (Fig. 1 A). This result can be explained by a recent report that identified glycosaminoglycans as the major CyPA-binding molecules on CHO and other cells (15Saphire A.C. Bobardt M.D. Gallay P.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6771-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sulfated glycosaminoglycans also serve as low affinity binding sites for CyPB (11Carpentier M. Allain F. Haendler B. Denys A. Mariller C. Benaissa M. Spik G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of CHO.CD147 cells with three different heparitinases, which significantly eliminate surface heparans (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel, and1 C), also significantly diminished binding of fluorescently labeled CyPA (Fig. 1 B, upper panel) without affecting expression of CD147 (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, heparans, but not CD147, appear to determine principally CyPA binding to the cell surface. Because heparans are extremely abundant on the cell surface, their high capacity interaction with CyPA can mask CyPA binding to CD147. Three approaches were used to demonstrate specific CyPA-CD147 interaction. We first transfected a heparan-deficient clone of CHO cells, CHOpgsB-618, with a CD147-expressing construct (or an empty pcDNA vector) and produced cells stably expressing CD147. Using iodinated CyPA, we demonstrated CD147-specific (cold competable) binding of CyPA to these cells (Fig. 1 D). In another approach, we used mutant CyPAm4, which does not bind heparans because four basic residues in its COOH-terminal region (Arg148, Lys151, Lys154, and Lys155) responsible for heparan binding had been replaced with alanines (15Saphire A.C. Bobardt M.D. Gallay P.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6771-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). When iodinated, CyPAm4 specifically bound to CHO.CD147 but not to CHO.pcDNA cells (Fig.1 D). Our attempts to measure the Kd of CyPA-CD147 binding were unsuccessful, likely because this binding is of relatively low affinity and requires a large excess of cold CyPA for saturation. This result suggests that interaction between CyPA and CD147 is different from classical ligand-receptor interactions and might be of transitory nature, similar to enzyme-substrate interactions (see below) and consistent with the enzymatic activity of CyPA. Heparans might serve as primary binding sites for CyPA and thus stimulate its interaction with CD147, consistent with their requirement for CyPA-induced signaling and chemotaxis (see below). To demonstrate directly the interaction between CyPA and CD147 expressed on CHO cells we employed a cross-linking approach. CyPA (and BSA used as a negative control) was activated by incubating with a biotin-containing trifunctional cross-linking reagent, Sulfo-SBED. This reagent has amine group-specific reactivity, a nonspecific photoreactivity, and a biotin handle. The cross-linking can be reversed by thiol cleavage. Activated purified CyPA or BSA was incubated with CHO.pcDNA or CHO.CD147 cells, and cross-linking was induced by UV irradiation. After cell lysis, biotin-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of human CD147. As shown in Fig.1 E, high molecular mass bands (∼200 kDa) were observed in the lysate of CHO.CD147 (but not CHO.pcDNA) cells incubated with CyPA (but not with BSA) and analyzed under nonreducing conditions. Under reducing conditions that reverse cross-linking, these bands disappeared. Two faster migrating bands (obviously corresponding to nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms of CD147 with a molecular mass of 35 and 55 kDa, respectively) revealed in the lysates from CHO.CD147 cells under both reducing and nonreducing conditions likely represent CD147 nonspecifically labeled by contaminating Sulfo-SBED. This conclusion was supported by a control experiment with mock treated CHO.CD147 cells in which these bands were still observed (not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CyPA specifically associates with CD147. To determine whether binding of CyPA to CD147 initiates intracellular signaling events, we measured Ca2+ flux in CHO.CD147 and CHO.pcDNA cells stimulated with CyPA. A characteristic flux of intracellular Ca2+ was observed in CHO.CD147, but not in CHO.pcDNA cells (Fig.2 A, left panel). This signal was eliminated by anti-CD147 antibody that recognizes an epitope in the extracellular domain of CD147, but not by isotype control (Fig. 2 A, left panel). Consistent with the essential role of heparans in CyPA binding to cells, pretreatment of cells with heparitinase also eliminated CyPA-specific Ca2+ flux (Fig. 2 A, right panel). To investigate other signaling pathways that could be initiated by CyPA through CD147, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases in CyPA-treated CHO.CD147 and CHO.pcDNA cells. A characteristic increase in the level of phosphorylated ERKs was observed after the addition of CyPA to CHO.CD147, but not to CHO.pcDNA cells (Fig. 2 B, upper panels). A time course analysis demonstrated that ERK activation reached maximum at 5 min after stimulation and gradually decreased afterward (Fig.2 B, bottom panels). No such increase in phosphorylation was detected for JNK or p38 MAP kinases (not shown). The observed CyPA-induced CD147-mediated signaling is similar to signaling induced in vesicular smooth muscle cells by CyPA secreted in response to oxidative stress (6Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G. Liao D.F. Yan C. Haendeler J. Suh Y.A. Lambeth J.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD147 might be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Consistent with the requirement of heparans for CyPA signaling, mutant CyPAm4, which does not bind heparans, did not induce (at a 100 ng/ml concentration) signaling events in CHO.CD147 cells (Fig. 2 C). Some signaling was seen at higher concentrations (1 μg/ml) of mutant CyPA (not shown), conforming the role of heparan in stimulating physiological activity of low concentrations of ligands (27Schonherr E. Hausser H.J. Dev. Immunol. 2000; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To determine whether integrity of the CyPA active center was essential for signaling, we made use of a previously described panel of active site mutants of CyPA. The F60A and H126A mutants have been shown to retain less than 1% of the wild-type catalytic efficiency in a tetrapeptide assay, whereas the F113A mutant retains about 10%, and the rotamase activity of the W121A mutant is reduced only by about 2-fold (28Zydowsky L.D.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2306-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The W121A mutation, despite its relatively moderate effect on catalytic activity, caused a 75-fold decrease in sensitivity to cyclosporin A (49Liu J. Chen C.M. Walsh C.T. Bioche"

https://openalex.org/W2083332433,"In the human stomach, gastric lipase hydrolyzes only 10 to 30% of ingested triacylglycerols because of an inhibition process induced by the long chain free fatty acids generated, which are mostly protonated at gastric pH. The aim of this work was to elucidate the mechanisms by which free fatty acids inhibit further hydrolysis.In vitro experiments examined gastric lipolysis of differently sized phospholipid-triolein emulsions by human gastric juice or purified human gastric lipase, under close to physiological conditions. The lipolysis process was further investigated by scanning electron microscopy, and gastric lipase and free fatty acid movement during lipolysis were followed by fluorescence microscopy. The results demonstrate that: 1) free fatty acids generated during lipolysis partition between the surface and core of lipid droplets with a molar phase distribution coefficient of 7.4 at pH 5.40; 2) the long chain free fatty acids have an inhibitory effect only when generated during lipolysis; 3) inhibition of gastric lipolysis can be delayed by the use of lipid emulsions composed of small-size lipid droplets; 4) the release of free fatty acids during lipolysis induces a marked increase in droplet surface area, leading to the formation of novel particles at the lipid droplet surface; and 5) the gastric lipase is trapped in these free fatty acid-rich particles during their formation. In conclusion, we propose a model in which the sequential physicochemical events occurring during gastric lipolysis lead to the inhibition of further triacylglycerol lipolysis. In the human stomach, gastric lipase hydrolyzes only 10 to 30% of ingested triacylglycerols because of an inhibition process induced by the long chain free fatty acids generated, which are mostly protonated at gastric pH.

The lipid droplets consist of a hydrophobic core containing the majority of the triacylglycerol molecules, esterified cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins, surrounded by an amphipatic surface monolayer of phospholipids, free cholesterol, and a few triacylglycerol molecules (11Miller K.W.

Hamosh P. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The relatively limited extent of lipolysis by the gastric lipase under physiological or pathological conditions suggested that a feedback inhibition by the products of lipolysis probably occurs (1Carey M.C. Small D.M. Bliss C.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 651-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 22Hamosh M. Ganot D. Hamosh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12121-12125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the inhibition of gastric lipase activity may be due to the progressive release of protonated free fatty acids (8Borel P. Armand M. Ythier P. Dutot G. Melin C. Senft M.

At present, however, the mechanism by which free fatty acids inhibit gastric lipase action in the stomach is unknown. It can be suggested from the literature that long chain free fatty acids prevent further gastric lipase lipolysis by modifying the physicochemical properties of the lipid/water interface, especially the interfacial tension or the surface pressure (2Brockman H.L. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1984: 3-46Google Scholar, 13Miller K.W. Small D.M. Gotto A.M. Plasma Lipoproteins.

Biochem. 1986; 156: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); they could prevent the interfacial binding of gastric lipase or promote its release from the droplet surface (2Brockman H.L. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1984: 3-46Google Scholar), or they could limit the number of triacylglycerol molecules located at the droplet surface by steric hindrance (13Miller K.W. Small D.M. Gotto A.M. Plasma Lipoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 1-74Google Scholar). However, thus far no study has provided direct evidence for the mechanisms involved. A few previous studies have examined the effect of free fatty acid on gastric lipase activity (8Borel P. Armand M. Ythier P. Dutot G. Melin C. Senft M. Lafont H. Lairon D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1994; 5: 124-133Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Gargouri Y. Pieroni G. Rivière C. Sauniére J.F. Lowe P.A. Sarda L. Verger R. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the distribution of fatty acids in model systems (26Spooner P.J.R. Bennett Clark S. Gantz D.L. Hamilton J.A.

Acta. 1988; 959: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), however, they were not performed under physiological conditions. In the present work we have performed several in vitro experiments using conditions close to those occurring physiologically, to understand the mechanism of inhibition of gastric lipolysis in vivo, and to begin to elucidate conditions that will enable modulation of the extent of gastric lipolysis. Human gastric juice was collected from healthy adult patients for diagnostic purposes after pentagastric stimulation (6 μg/kg) (a generous gift from Dr. J. Peyrot and Pr. J. Salducci, Gastroenterology Department, Nord Hospital, Marseille, France). Pure human gastric lipase (HGL)1 with a specific activity of 910 units/mg on tributyrin was obtained according to Thiruppathi and Balasubramanian (29Tiruppathi C. Balasubramanian K.A. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 22: 111-114PubMed Google Scholar). Gastric lipase activity of gastric juice (100–200 μl) or purified lipase was determined using a pH-stat titrator (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) at pH 5.40 and 37 °C with tributyrin as substrate (ICN Biomedicals Inc., OH) as previously described (3Armand M. Borel P. Dubois C. Senft M. Peyrot J. Salducci J. Lafont H. Lairon D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G372-G381PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gargouri Y. Pieroni G. Rivière C. Sauniére J.F. Lowe P.A. Sarda L. Verger R. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One lipase unit corresponds to the release of 1 μmol of fatty acid per min. The relative proportion of lipids used was chosen in accordance with human daily dietary intake (1Carey M.C. Small D.M. Bliss C.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 651-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The lipid mixture contained 93.5% triolein (w/w) (ICN), 6% phospholipids (PL) (w/w) (l-α-phosphatidylcholine, XVI-E from egg yolk), and 0.5% free cholesterol (w/w) (both from Sigma, La Verpillière, France). Lipids were solubilized in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), mixed, dried under nitrogen, and dessicated using a rotavapor under vacuum at 30 °C. The lipid mixture was stored at −20 °C. For lipolysis experiments, the mixture contained [3H]- or [14C]triolein (3 × 104 dpm/μmol of triolein or 1.5 × 106 dpm/μmol of triolein when a low HGL/TO ratio was used) and [14C]l-α1-palmitoyl–2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (3.5 × 104 dpm/μmol PL) (PerkinElmer Life Science, Dreiech, Belgium). Lipid mixtures enriched with different concentrations of oleic acid (OA) (2 and 6.9% oleic acid (w/w), i.e. 0.063 and 0.216 μmol of OA/μmol of TO) contained [14C]triolein (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 3 × 104 dpm/μmol of triolein) and [3H]oleic acid (1.2 × 104 dpm/μmol of OA) (Amersham International plc, UK). These OA/TO ratios were selected to mimic the amount of free fatty acids released after 2 or 25 min of gastric lipolysis under present physiological conditions, respectively. To study the distribution of lipolysis-generated free fatty acids between the core and surface of the lipid droplet, the lipid mixture was radiolabeled with [14C]triolein (106dpm/μmol of triolein), [3H]l-α-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (106 dpm/μmol PL), and [3H]cholesterol (107 dpm/μmol of free cholesterol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The lipid mixture for fluorescence studies was labeled with dansyl cholesterol (gift from Drs. A. Misharin and C. Alquier). A fine emulsion (about 0.7 μm in median diameter) was prepared by sonication of 100 mg of lipid mixture in 6 ml of distilled water for 10 min at 95% power level and a frequency of 20,178 Hz (Sonoreactor, Undatim, Japan), in ice/ethanol. A medium-size emulsion (about 2 μm) was obtained by sonicating 100 mg of lipid mixture in 3 ml of distilled water for 5 min at 25 watts power in an ice/ethanol cooling bath using a microtip probe (Brandson 250 W sonifier, Osi, France). A coarse emulsion (about 15 μm) was prepared by mechanical stirring of 100 mg of lipid mixture in 1 ml of distilled water for 1.5 min at room temperature. The emulsions obtained were collected after concentration and removal of excess phospholipids as follow: the coarse emulsion was allowed to stand for 10 min in ice, and the medium-size and fine ones were centrifuged 10 min or 1 h at 4,000 rpm and 10 °C, respectively. The resultant triacylglycerol/phospholipid ratios (w/w) were found to be 50/1, 40/1, and 14/1 for the coarse, medium, and fine emulsions, respectively. The emulsion droplet sizes were determined as previously reported (3Armand M. Borel P. Dubois C. Senft M. Peyrot J. Salducci J. Lafont H. Lairon D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G372-G381PubMed Google Scholar) using a particle-size analyzer (Capa-700, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). The results are given in the form of a frequency distribution graph (Fig. 1). Emulsion median diameter (μm) and emulsion surface area (Sw, m2/g emulsified fat) were calculated by the particle-sizer software from the droplet size distribution. The coarse emulsion (Fig. 1 A) was composed of lipid droplets sizing from 1 to 40 μm with a majority of particles between 8 and 30 μm (about 70% total particles by volume). For the medium-size emulsion (Fig. 1 B), lipid droplets sized from 0.1 to 40 μm and about 80% of total particles ranged from 1 to 4 μm. The fine emulsion (Fig. 1 C) was mainly composed of small size droplets from 0.1 to 2 μm, with 75% of total particles sizing between 0.1 and 1 μm. Emulsion surface area varied inversely with the emulsion median diameter. Both parameters were significantly different for the three emulsions (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Experiments were carried out at 37 °C and pH 5.40, using polycarbonate test tubes (13 × 51 mm, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) to limit the loss of lipid molecules on the inner surface of the test tube during lipolysis. The reaction medium was a 2.5-ml mixture containing 100 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CaCl2 (buffer L), 1.5 μm bovine serum albumin, and 25 μmol of triolein emulsified as described above. The HGL/TO ratio was selected to mimic physiological conditions (3Armand M. Borel P. Dubois C. Senft M. Peyrot J. Salducci J. Lafont H. Lairon D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G372-G381PubMed Google Scholar, 10Armand M. Pasquier B. André M. Borel P. Senft M. Peyrot J. Salducci J. Portugal H. Jaussan V. Lairon D. Am. J. Clin.

Samples (200 μl) were collected at intervals from 0 to 100 min, and lipids were extracted immediately by the Folch method (30Folch J. Lees M. Stanley J.H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 498-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel (Ready plastic sheet F1500, Schleider and Schuell, Germany) according to Bitman and Wood (31Bitman J. Wood D.L. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1981; 4: 1023-1034Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After exposure to iodine vapors, individual lipid spots were scraped and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (1600TR, Packard, Meriden, CT). The reaction medium was a 0.8 ml of mixture of buffer L with medium-size [3H]triolein emulsion, at pH 5.4 and 37 °C. Three HGL/TO ratios were used corresponding to high (53.2 pmol/μmol) and moderate (10.6 pmol/μmol) physiological ratios, and to a large excess substrate (0.21 pmol/μmol). In the first experiment, a large amount of exogenous OA (1.4 μmol of OA/μmol of triolein) (final ethanol concentration: 1.2–2.5%, v/v) was added prior to the initiation of lipolysis or 5 min after. In addition, a physiological amount of OA, corresponding to the amount of free fatty acid generated during a 60-min lipolysis of the emulsion (0.3 μmol of OA/μmol of triolein), was added 5 min after lipolysis started. For the second and third experiments, 0.3 μmol of OA/μmol of triolein was added before or 5 min after the beginning of lipolysis. Samples (100 μl) were collected at intervals from 0 to 60 min. [3H]OA produced were separated by liquid-liquid partition (32Belfrage P. Vaughan M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and radioactivity was measured as described above. The reaction medium was a 0.8-ml mixture of buffer L with [3H]OA (2 or 6.9%) and [14C]TO-PL emulsions of 2.5 or 1.3 μm, respectively, at pH 5.4 and 37 °C. The HGL/TO ratio was 53.2 pmol/μmol. Samples (100 μl) were collected at intervals from 0 to 60 min and the amount of [14C]OA released was determined as described above. The reaction medium was a 1.1-ml mixture of buffer L and [3H]triolein medium-size emulsion at pH 5.4 and 37 °C, with a HGL/TO ratio of 53.2 pmol/μmol. Samples (100 μl) were collected from 0 to 60 min. After 60 min lipolysis, a new dose of HGL was added, thus doubling the initial concentration of enzyme, and lipolysis was carried out for an additional 60 min. Samples (100 μl) were collected then from 65 to 120 min after lipolysis. The reaction medium was a 1.5-ml mixture of buffer L and [3H]triolein medium-size emulsion, at pH 5.4 and 37 °C. Pure HGL or gastric juice, with a gastric lipase equivalent/triolein ratio of 53.2 pmol/μmol were used. Samples (100 μl) were collected from 0 to 90 min. At 90 min, a [14C]triolein medium-size emulsion was added, thus doubling the initial concentration of triolein. Samples (100 μl) were then collected at 95 to 180 min lipolysis. The amounts of [3H]- and [14C]OA released were determined as described above. Rates of lipolysis were calculated as the percent of triacylglycerols hydrolyzed, from micromoles of released OA at a given time (OA t ) relative to the total micromoles of physiologically releasable OA (S n-1 andS n-3 positions), based on the initial amount of triolein, using the following equation: [OA t /(TO × 2)] × 100. Samples of a radiolabeled medium-size emulsion collected before or after 10, 25, and 60 min lipolysis by pure HGL were transferred to sealed glass disposable micro-sampling pipettes (inner diameter (1.1–1.2 mm) × L (75 mm)) (Corning, New York) and the surface and core phases of the lipid droplets were separated by centrifugating at 20,000 rpm for 18 h in a Beckman SW 40 Ti swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc.) using a Beckman Ultracentrifuge (model number L7) according to Miller and Small (11Miller K.W. Small D.M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1982; 89: 466-478Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lipid classes of the two phases were analyzed as described above. Samples of a lipolysed medium-size emulsion collected at intervals from 0 to 80 min were mixed volume/volume with 1% OsO4 in distilled water at pH 5.4 and room temperature. The mixture was gently shaken, put on a microscope cover glass, and fixed overnight in a moist chamber at room temperature. The emulsion deposit was then gently washed with distilled water, first dried with filter paper followed by drying 1 day in a silica gel dessicator. Preparations were gold-palladium coated then examined at magnification ×4,800 to 6,600 with a JSM-35CF scanning electron microscope (JEOLS, Paris, France) operated at 35 kV accelerating potential. An aliquot (50 μl) of a medium-size emulsion previously incubated with HGL for 60 min was mixed in a shaking bath at 37 °C with a medium-size emulsion labeled with dansyl cholesterol to distinguish from the first emulsion, at pH 5.40 for 15 min. Then the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice with 10 μl of purified specific polyclonal anti-HGL antibodies (6.2 mg/ml) from rabbit (diluted 10 times in buffer L) followed by incubation for 30 min on ice with 10 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) (diluted 10 times in buffer L). High levels of antibodies were used to obtain sufficient labeling at acid pH and cold temperature. A negative control was performed without the enzyme. HGL was mixed with TRITC (Molecular Probe, Inc.) (25 μg/mg of protein) in 25 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.0, at room temperature for 1 h, then quickly neutralized to pH 6.0, dialyzed against sodium acetate 50 mm, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, at cold temperature overnight and concentrated on PEG-6000 at 4 °C. Under these conditions HGL retained about 60% of its initial activity. Based on the method of Holczinger (33Holczinger L. Acta Histochem. 1959; 8: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar), a copper acetate solution (Sigma) (0.15% final concentration) was mixed carefully into the reaction medium after 90 min lipolysis of a medium-size emulsion. The copper-free fatty acid soaps formed were then visualized with FITC-Gly-Gly-His (Molecular probe) (38 μg/ml final concentration), a marker with high selectivity and sensitivity for Cu2+ due to the presence of the tripeptide commonly called copper-binding peptide (34Lau S.J. Kruck T.P.A. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All specimens were examined under a Leitz Dialux 20 microscope (Jena, Germany) equipped with a Ploemopak 3.1 epifluorescence system using filters specific for FITC (filter bloc Leitz model L3), dansyl cholesterol (filter block Leitz model A2), or TRITC (filter block Leitz model N2), at a final magnification of ×1,250. Photomicrographs were taken using a CCD color Camera (DC 100, Leica, Switzerland). A [14C]triolein, [3H]PL, free [3H]cholesterol medium-size emulsion was incubated with HGL for 90 min. The lipid particles generated during lipolysis were isolated by FPLC using a Superose 6 column (6 × 57 cm) at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with buffer L as eluent. The lipid droplets are retained on the column. The fractions obtained were analyzed for lipid composition by TLC and radioisotope counting as described above. The size of the lipid particles was determined with a quasielastic light-scattering detector (SEMAtech, Nice, France). The presence of HGL was ascertained by immunoblotting (35Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar) by depositing 20 μl of the various fractions on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; the membrane was soaked for 30 min at room temperature in 5% skim milk in a TBS Tween buffer, washed, and incubated with HGL-polyclonal rabbit antiserum (final dilution 1:5000); immunodetection was carried out with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (final dilution 1:5000) (Sigma). Statistical significances were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the differences were determined by the Fisher's test at a probability of 95%. Correlation coefficient was obtained from linear regression (StatView II; Abacus, Berkeley, CA) (36Winer B.J. Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. McGraw-Hill, New York1971Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1991549727,"Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein generates β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides that are deposited in senile plaques in brains of aged individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Presenilins (PS1 and PS2) facilitate the final step in Aβ production, the intramembranous γ-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological evidence support a catalytic or accessory role for PS1 in γ-secretase cleavage, as well as a regulatory role in select membrane protein trafficking. In this report, we demonstrate that PS1 is required for maturation and cell surface accumulation of nicastrin, an integral component of the multimeric γ-secretase complex. Using kinetic labeling studies we show that in PS1 −/−/PS2 −/− cells nicastrin fails to reach the medial Golgi compartment, and as a consequence, is incompletely glycosylated. Stable expression of human PS1 restores these deficiencies in PS1 −/−fibroblasts. Moreover, membrane fractionation studies show co-localization of PS1 fragments with mature nicastrin. These results indicate a novel chaperone-type role for PS1 and PS2 in facilitating nicastrin maturation and transport in the early biosynthetic compartments. Our findings are consistent with PS1 influencing γ-secretase processing at multiple steps, including maturation and intracellular trafficking of substrates and component(s) of the γ-secretase complex."

We have utilized two complementary approaches to identify genes that are predominantly affected by rapamycin in Jurkat T cells. One was to compare levels of polysome-bound and total RNA using oligonucleotide microarrays complementary to 6,300 human genes. Another was to determine protein synthesis levels using two-dimensional PAGE. Analysis of expression changes at the polysome-bound RNA levels showed that translation of most of the expressed genes was partially reduced following rapamycin treatment. However, translation of 136 genes (6% of the expressed genes) was totally inhibited. This group included genes encoding RNA-binding proteins and several proteasome subunit members. Translation of a set of 159 genes (7%) was largely unaffected by rapamycin treatment. These genes included transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, and members of the RAS superfamily. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from the same cell populations using two-dimensional PAGE showed that the integrated intensity of 111 of 830 protein spots changed in rapamycin-treated cells by at least 3-fold (70 increased, 41 decreased). We identified 22 affected protein spots representing protein products of 16 genes. The combined microarray and proteomic approach has uncovered novel genes affected by rapamycin that may be involved in its immunosuppressive effect and other genes that are not affected at the level of translation in a context of general inhibition of cap-dependent translation.

It is a potent immunosuppressant with therapeutic applications in the prevention of organ allograft rejection and in the treatment of autoimmune disease (2Saunders R.N. Metcalfe M.S. Nicholson M.L.

Rheumatol. 2000; 29: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The importance of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant drug has focused attention on its mechanism of action. Rapamycin has a similar biochemical structure to cyclosporin A and FK506. However, unlike cyclosporin A and FK506, rapamycin is not a calcineurin inhibitor (7Morris R.E. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 137-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The primary mode of immunosuppressive action of rapamycin is an antiproliferative action reflecting the ability of the drug to disrupt signaling by T cell growth-promoting lymphokines such as IL-21 and IL-4 (8Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L. Melino M.R. Sigal N.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar). The growth-inhibitory effects of rapamycin are not limited to T cells, since this drug inhibits the proliferation of many mammalian cell types as well as that of yeast cells (9Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar).Rapamycin blocks progression of the cell cycle at the G1phase by binding to FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein) (10Koltin Y. Faucette L. Bergsma D.J. Levy M.A. Cafferkey R. Koser P.L. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 11Fruman D.A.

Rapamycin-induced inhibition of p70s6k activity and subsequent dephosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein lead to a selective translational repression of mRNA containing a polypyrimidine-rich tract (TOP) motif at their 5′ terminus (17Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 is a small heat- and acid-stable protein whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation. Dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 inhibits cap-dependent translation by binding to the mRNA cap-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) (18Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence J.C., Jr. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 19Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence J.C. Jr. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). We previously reported that rapamycin blocks the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and inhibits specifically cap-dependent initiation of translation (12Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and that, in contrast, rapamycin increases internal initiation of translation, a mechanism independent of the cap structure and reported so far for some viral and cellular mRNAs (20Beretta L. Svitkin Y.V. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8993-8996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We performed a systematic study to identify global and specific effects of rapamycin on translation. To determine rapamycin-sensitive transcripts, we used a methodology based on the separation of polysomes from mRNPs using sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by oligonucleotide microarray hybridization. This technology has been recently adapted for studies of translational control (21Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 22Zong Q. Schummer M. Hood L. Morris D.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1641-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is based on the assumption that translationally inactive mRNAs are present as free cytoplasmic mRNPs, whereas actively translated mRNAs are contained within polysomes. This enables identification of mRNAs specifically mobilized from free mRNPs onto polysomes andvice versa in T cells in response to rapamycin. A complementary approach used proteomic analysis to systematically analyze gene expression in T cells in response to rapamycin.DISCUSSIONTo develop a better understanding of rapamycin's molecular mechanism in T cells, we utilized two complementary approaches to identify specific genes regulated by rapamycin in T cells. One relies on the quantitative analysis of translated mRNAs by DNA microarrays. The other relies on quantitative analysis and identification of proteins by proteomics. In addition, we quantitated polysome-bound mRNAs as a measure of their translation efficiency (29Pradet-Balade B. Boulme F. Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins and elongation factors contain a polypyrimidine tract at the 5′-end of their mRNAs and have been described as translationally repressed by rapamycin (17Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Indeed, translation of a large number of ribosomal proteins and elongation factors was found to be strongly repressed by rapamycin in our study. We have uncovered a large number of additional genes. Part of the regulated genes have functions related to RNA processing and translation. Translation initiation factors 4A and 5A were strongly repressed. Translation of prothymosin α was also strongly repressed by rapamycin. Interestingly, prothymosin α has been reported to enhance cell-mediated immunity as well as proliferative and cytotoxic responses of T cells (30Bustelo X.R. Otero A. Gomez-Marquez J. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1443-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vuckovic-Dekic L. Stanojevic-Bakic N. Int. J. Thymol. 1997; 5: 399Google Scholar, 32Baxevanis C.N. Reclos G.J.

Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, prothymosin α has been shown to exert a potentiating effect on human CD4+ T cell proliferation in response to antigens, which was associated with a prothymosin-induced increase in IL-2 production. It was also demonstrated that prothymosin α, in combination with IL-2, can render cell to cell interactions more effective, resulting in increased killing of autologous tumors (34Grunberg E. Eckert K. Maurer H.R. Int. J. Thymol. 1997; 5: 415Google Scholar).Remarkably, translation of seven genes encoding proteasome subunit members was abolished, which would explain in molecular terms the reported inhibition of proteasome activator expression and proteasome activity by rapamycin (35Wang X. Omura S. Szweda L.I. Yang Y. Berard J. Seminaro J. Wu J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2781-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The proteasome-mediated degradation pathway regulates a wide variety of cellular activities, including cell growth and immune and inflammatory responses. Within the immune system, the proteasome is essential for production of peptides for major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation. More recent studies have suggested a possible role for the proteasome in regulating the levels of cell surface receptors. In particular, a functional proteasome is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL-2 receptor-ligand complex and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2, possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome (36Yu A. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 381-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies have implicated the proteasome in the regulation of Jak-STAT signal transduction, including IL-2-induced activation of STAT5 (37Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 38Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14017-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Adhesion molecules are essential in interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, between T help cells and T effector cells, and between T cells and endothelial cells. It has been recently demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors repress T lymphocyte aggregation and then potentially cell-cell interactions in the immune system (39Kanaan N. Luo H., Wu, J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Finally, a role of proteasomes in T cell activation, proliferation, and apoptosis has been reported (40Wang X. Luo H. Chen H. Duguid W. Wu J. J. Immunol. 1998; 15: 788-801Google Scholar, 41Marshansky V. Wang X. Bertrand R. Luo H. Duguid W. Chinnadurai G. Kanaan N., Vu, M.D. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3130-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) including a requirement of the proteasome activity for T cells to progress from the G0 to S phase. Most interestingly, inhibition of proteasome activity is a common feature of immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506 (42Meyer S. Kohler N.G. Joly A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This raised the intriguing possibility that the proteasome is one of the common downstream targets of these drugs. In addition, our data elucidated the mechanisms by which rapamycin is inhibiting the expression of some proteasome proteins. Therefore, we identified important downstream targets of rapamycin such as prothymosin α and proteasome subunits that may modulate the immune response following rapamycin treatment and mediate the immunosuppressive effects of this drug.Translation of the majority of eukaryotic mRNAs is initiated through a cap. Some mRNAs, however, are translated by a cap-independent mechanism, mediated by ribosome binding to internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements located in the 5′-untranslated region. So far, only a handful of cellular IRES have been described (43Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that rapamycin inhibits specifically cap-dependent translation, whereas cap-independent translation is unaffected or slightly increased (12Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 20Beretta L. Svitkin Y.V. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8993-8996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified 159 genes that are still translated in the presence of rapamycin. These genes are candidates for IRES-driven mRNAs. Remarkably, these genes included three genes reported to harbor an IRES, the human immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein Bip/GRP78 (44Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), the cyclin-dependent kinase p58 (PITSLRE) (45Cornelis S. Bruynooghe Y. Denecker G. Van Huffel S. Tinton S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and the transcription activator TFIID (46Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Additional genes unaffected by rapamycin included specific families such as kinases and phosphatases, DNA-binding factors, and genes controlling transcription as well as RAS superfamily members. Some genes of these families have been previously described to be translated in poliovirus-infected cells, featuring a general inhibition of cap-dependent translation (21Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).In addition to a translational control by rapamycin, rapamycin affected transcript levels of several genes within a short time period. Most genes were growth-related and may explain the strong inhibition of proliferation observed in rapamycin-treated cells. We observed an up-regulation of several negative regulators of cell proliferation such as cyclin G2 (47Horne M.C. Donaldson K.L. Goolsby G.L. Tran D Mulheisen M. Hell J.W. Wahl A.F. J. Biol.

These genes included cyclin D2 (52Ajchanbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol.

Remarkably, expression of three subunits of the 26 S proteasome was also decreased, suggesting an inhibition of the proteasome at both transcriptional and translational control. Similarly, cyclin F, ETS2 repressor factor, Fas/Apo-1, and tumor necrosis factor receptor were both transcriptionally and translationally up-regulated by rapamycin.Proteomic analysis of the same populations did validate the microarray data. Intensities of 8% of the [35S]methionine-labeled protein spots increased, and intensities of 5% decreased. In addition, microarray and proteomic analysis were similar for 15 regulated proteins identified. The oligonucleotide array and proteomics analyses undertaken in this study have uncovered novel genes and proteins with potential roles in the immunosuppressive response effect of rapamycin. Microarray analysis has identified important changes in genes involved in immune response and growth control as well as in the degradation pathway. This study also demonstrates that close to 7% of cellular mRNAs are still translated in a context of a general shut-off of protein synthesis. Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic originally isolated fromStreptomyces hygroscopicus (1Sehgal S.N. Baker H. Vezina C. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1975; 38: 727-732Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar). It is a potent immunosuppressant with therapeutic applications in the prevention of organ allograft rejection and in the treatment of autoimmune disease (2Saunders R.N. Metcalfe M.S. Nicholson M.L.

Rheumatol. 2000; 29: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The importance of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant drug has focused attention on its mechanism of action. Rapamycin has a similar biochemical structure to cyclosporin A and FK506. However, unlike cyclosporin A and FK506, rapamycin is not a calcineurin inhibitor (7Morris R.E. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 137-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The primary mode of immunosuppressive action of rapamycin is an antiproliferative action reflecting the ability of the drug to disrupt signaling by T cell growth-promoting lymphokines such as IL-21 and IL-4 (8Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L. Melino M.R. Sigal N.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar). The growth-inhibitory effects of rapamycin are not limited to T cells, since this drug inhibits the proliferation of many mammalian cell types as well as that of yeast cells (9Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Rapamycin blocks progression of the cell cycle at the G1phase by binding to FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein) (10Koltin Y. Faucette L. Bergsma D.J. Levy M.A. Cafferkey R. Koser P.L. Johnson R.K.

The rapamycin-FKBP12 complex inhibits mTOR (mammaliantarget of rapamycin), also referred to as FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associatedprotein) (9Schmelzle T. Hall M.N.

Rapamycin-induced inhibition of p70s6k activity and subsequent dephosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein lead to a selective translational repression of mRNA containing a polypyrimidine-rich tract (TOP) motif at their 5′ terminus (17Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 is a small heat- and acid-stable protein whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation. Dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 inhibits cap-dependent translation by binding to the mRNA cap-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) (18Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence J.C., Jr. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 19Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence J.C. Jr. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). We previously reported that rapamycin blocks the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and inhibits specifically cap-dependent initiation of translation (12Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and that, in contrast, rapamycin increases internal initiation of translation, a mechanism independent of the cap structure and reported so far for some viral and cellular mRNAs (20Beretta L. Svitkin Y.V. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8993-8996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed a systematic study to identify global and specific effects of rapamycin on translation. To determine rapamycin-sensitive transcripts, we used a methodology based on the separation of polysomes from mRNPs using sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by oligonucleotide microarray hybridization. This technology has been recently adapted for studies of translational control (21Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 22Zong Q. Schummer M. Hood L. Morris D.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1641-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is based on the assumption that translationally inactive mRNAs are present as free cytoplasmic mRNPs, whereas actively translated mRNAs are contained within polysomes. This enables identification of mRNAs specifically mobilized from free mRNPs onto polysomes andvice versa in T cells in response to rapamycin. A complementary approach used proteomic analysis to systematically analyze gene expression in T cells in response to rapamycin. DISCUSSIONTo develop a better understanding of rapamycin's molecular mechanism in T cells, we utilized two complementary approaches to identify specific genes regulated by rapamycin in T cells. One relies on the quantitative analysis of translated mRNAs by DNA microarrays. The other relies on quantitative analysis and identification of proteins by proteomics. In addition, we quantitated polysome-bound mRNAs as a measure of their translation efficiency (29Pradet-Balade B. Boulme F. Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins and elongation factors contain a polypyrimidine tract at the 5′-end of their mRNAs and have been described as translationally repressed by rapamycin (17Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Indeed, translation of a large number of ribosomal proteins and elongation factors was found to be strongly repressed by rapamycin in our study. We have uncovered a large number of additional genes. Part of the regulated genes have functions related to RNA processing and translation. Translation initiation factors 4A and 5A were strongly repressed. Translation of prothymosin α was also strongly repressed by rapamycin. Interestingly, prothymosin α has been reported to enhance cell-mediated immunity as well as proliferative and cytotoxic responses of T cells (30Bustelo X.R. Otero A. Gomez-Marquez J. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1443-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vuckovic-Dekic L. Stanojevic-Bakic N. Int. J. Thymol. 1997; 5: 399Google Scholar, 32Baxevanis C.N. Reclos G.J.

In vivo, prothymosin α has been shown to exert a potentiating effect on human CD4+ T cell proliferation in response to antigens, which was associated with a prothymosin-induced increase in IL-2 production.

https://openalex.org/W2086887115,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> RNase R, a 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease homologous to RNase II, was overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity in its native untagged form by a rapid procedure. The purified enzyme was free of nucleic acid. It migrated upon gel filtration chromatography as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of ∼95 kDa, in close agreement with its expected size based on the sequence of the <i>rnr</i> gene. RNase R was most active at pH 7.5–9.5 in the presence of 0.1–0.5 mm Mg<sup>2+</sup>and 50–500 mm KCl. The enzyme shares many catalytic properties with RNase II. Both enzymes are nonspecific processive ribonucleases that release 5′-nucleotide monophosphates and leave a short undigested oligonucleotide core. However, whereas RNase R shortens RNA processively to di- and trinucleotides, RNase II becomes more distributive when the length of the substrate reaches ∼10 nucleotides, and it leaves an undigested core of 3–5 nucleotides. Both enzymes work on substrates with a 3′-phosphate group. RNase R and RNase II are most active on synthetic homopolymers such as poly(A), but their substrate specificities differ. RNase II is more active on poly(A), whereas RNase R is much more active on rRNAs. Neither RNase R nor RNase II can degrade a complete RNA-RNA or DNA-RNA hybrid or one with a 4-nucleotide 3′-RNA overhang. RNase R differs from RNase II in that it cannot digest DNA oligomers and is not inhibited by such molecules, suggesting that it does not bind DNA. Although the <i>in vivo</i>function of RNase R is not known, its ability to digest certain natural RNAs may explain why it is maintained in <i>E. coli</i> together with RNase II."

Although certain responses, such as adhesion and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α, are inhibited by pretreatment with an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, others, such as actin assembly, are unaffected. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in neutrophil gene transcription and protein expression following lipopolysaccharide exposure and to establish their dependence on p38 signaling. Microarray analysis indicated expression of 13% of the 7070 Affymetrix gene set in nonstimulated neutrophils, and LPS up-regulation of 100 distinct genes, including cytokines and chemokines, signaling molecules, and regulators of transcription. Proteomic analysis yielded a separate list of up-regulated modulators of inflammation, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins. Poor concordance between mRNA transcript and protein expression changes was noted. Pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 attenuated 23% of LPS-regulated genes and 18% of LPS-regulated proteins by ≥40%. This study indicates that p38 plays a selective role in regulation of neutrophil transcripts and proteins following lipopolysaccharide exposure, clarifies that several of the effects of lipopolysaccharide are post-transcriptional and post-translational, and identifies several proteins not previously reported to be involved in the innate immune response.

These “immediate” functional responses, including actin assembly, adhesion, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and priming for an enhanced secretory response and for release of reactive oxygen intermediates, appear to be central both to the innate immune response and to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory human diseases, including sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (6Parsons P.E. Worthen G.S. Moore E.E. Tate R.M. Henson P.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) has been shown to mediate LPS-induced PMN adhesion, NF-κB activation, and TNF-α and IL-8 translation and release (7Nick J.A.

Chest. 1999; 116: 54S-55SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and its blockade attenuates LPS-induced PMN accumulation in the airspace (8Nick J.A. Young S.K. Brown K.K. Avdi N.J. Arndt P.G. Suratt B.T. Janes M.S. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2151-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, other cascades almost certainly lead to downstream effectors of the LPS signal; for example, actin assembly appears to be p38 MAPK-independent (9Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Lehman L.A. McDonald P.P. Frasch S.C. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). An improved understanding of the transcriptional and translational responses of the neutrophil to LPS and the modulation of these responses by p38 MAPK might carry pathogenetic and therapeutic implications. Historically, it has been believed that the downstream PMN transcriptional response to LPS is static and that PMN functional responses to LPS that depend on de novo protein synthesis are primarily limited to the release of cytokines (10Cassatella M.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 21-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate a robust transcriptional response (11McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, most studies have relied upon and reported a short list of functional assays of the LPS-exposed PMN; therefore, no exhaustive investigation of either the transcriptional response or protein synthetic repertoire of the PMN has been reported. Although several techniques have been used to evaluate transcripts, the screening of global changes in mRNA by microarray analysis has only recently become possible. In this way, thousands of genes can be screened in an unbiased fashion for transcript abundance. Such genomic screens in mammalian cells have previously been applied to define altered expression profiles in response to agonists (12Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We have applied DNA microarrays and proteomics to define and compare transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations in the LPS-exposed PMN and to establish the dependence of these alterations on p38 MAPK signaling. Endotoxin-free reagents and plastics were used in all experiments. Aprotinin, leupeptin, AEBSF, E-64, pepstatin, and bestatin protease inhibitors, spermine HCl, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) were all purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). For two-dimensional PAGE, rehydration buffer, equilibration buffers, vertical electrophoresis solutions, and 10% homogeneous polyacrylamide slab gels were purchased from Genomic Solutions, Inc. (GSI, Ann Arbor, MI). Sequencing grade porcine trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). PMNs were isolated by the plasma Percoll method (22Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), a technique that yields less than 5% monocytic contamination, and resuspended at a concentration of 15.4 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 culture medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 1% heat-inactivated platelet-poor plasma. After addition of 100 ng/ml Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS (List Biological), incubation was carried out with continuous rotation (4 h, 37 °C) both in the presence and absence of SB203580. Both Affymetrix analysis and proteomic analysis utilized 75 × 106 cells. For microarray analysis, nonstimulated and 4-h-treated PMNs were collected from three separate donors. A more detailed time course following LPS exposure was performed using polymerase chain reaction. For proteomic analysis, LPS incubations from separate donors (n = 6) were performed and then analyzed individually. Control and post-LPS incubation PMNs were washed (0.34 m sucrose/1 mm EDTA/10 mm Tris) and then lysed in a modified rehydration buffer (GSI, Ann Arbor, MI) supplemented with 2m thiourea, 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 22.5 mm spermine HCl, and a mixture of six protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm AEBSF, 5 μm E-64, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm bestatin). DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 60 min (23Rabilloud T. Valette C. Lawrence J.J. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1552-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and subsequently labeled with biotin as described by Affymetrix. Briefly, first-strand synthesis was accomplished with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using a T7-oligo(dT)24 primer for 1 h at 42 °C followed by second-strand synthesis using E. coli DNA polymerase I and RNase H (Invitrogen) at 16 °C for 2 h. Double-stranded DNA was used as a template for in vitrotranscription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotin-labeled UTP and CTP using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo). Fifteen micrograms of cRNA was fragmented and used for hybridization to Affymetrix HuGene 6800FL Genechips. Each sample was hybridized initially using a Test2 Genechip to test for sample degradation and full-length in vitro translation. Data were analyzed using Affymetrix Genechip software. Results from three separate donors were analyzed. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using 2 μg total RNA, derived from 20 × 106 cells that were treated as indicated. Polymerase chain reactions were performed using specific primers for Mx-1, TNF-α, MCP-1, p65, S100A4, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The protein concentration of the lysates was measured as described by Bradford et al. (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Poor isoelectric focusing (IEF) results were encountered unless the polycationic spermine was diluted (data not shown); therefore, lysates were diluted with rehydration buffer (GSI, Ann Arbor, MI) to achieve a final spermine concentration of 6 mm. Equal protein loads (1.5 mg) of control and LPS-stimulated neutrophils were used to rehydrate IEF gels overnight (18 cm, pH 3–10 nonlinear Immobiline DryStrip IEF gels, Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ). IEF was performed at 20 °C to 100-kVh (Phaser, GSI) under mineral oil, followed by two 10-min SDS equilibration steps (DTT and then iodoacetamide-containing equilibration buffers, GSI) and then by vertical electrophoresis on 10% homogeneous polyacrylamide slab gels (GSI) at 500 V. Protein spots were visualized by agitation in colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (16 h) (25Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar), followed by destaining in deionized water (20 h). In separate experiments, control and LPS-stimulated PMN lysates from three donors were pooled and then analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE using overlapping narrow isoelectric point (pI) ranges (18 cm, pH 5.0–6.0, 5.5–6.7, and 6–11, AmershamBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Identical IEF and vertical electrophoresis parameters were used for all gels. Colloidal Coomassie-stained gels were digitized using a Powerlook II (UMAX Data Systems, Inc., Taiwan) flatbed scanner with 8-bit dynamic range and 150-dpi resolution. BioImage (GSI, Ann Arbor, MI) 2D-Analyzer software was used to locate, quantitate, and match protein spots on the control and LPS gel images. Analysis was performed by assigning 50 common anchor spots between paired images; the remaining spots were compared by a constellation-matching algorithm. All data were then carefully reviewed by the operator to account for any discrepancies. Protein loading between control and experimental gels may have varied because of inconsistencies in rehydration of the different IEF gel strips; therefore, gel images were normalized so that the sum of the integrated intensities of all matched spots on paired gels was made equal. Control and LPS-stimulated gel images from individual donor experiments were matched to generate composite images; composite images were then matched into a master composite image to track the LPS response of protein spots among different donors (26Arnott D. O'Connell K.L. King K.L. Stults J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Only those spots that were common (image-matched) to all original 12 (pH 3.0–10.0) gels were considered for further analysis. For these spots, the LPS-induced change in integrated intensity in the six experiments was subjected to statistical analysis with a two-tailed Student's t test, and those spots with p < 0.05 were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (described below). For the narrow range (pH 5.0–6.0, 5.5–6.7, and 6–11) two-dimensional PAGE experiments using pooled donors, only those spots with concordant regulation exceeding 1.5-fold or that appeared de novo in the LPS gel in two repeat experiments were further analyzed. In-gel digestion of protein spots was performed with sequencing grade porcine-modified trypsin using the method of Hellman et al. (27Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were then extracted (50 μl of 50% acetonitrile/5% trifluoroacetic acid, 2 h), and the supernatant was taken to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge and then redissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (20 μl, 0.5%). Peptides were then purified and concentrated using ZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA) operated in delayed extraction mode. Samples (0.5 μl) were spotted onto a sample plate to which matrix (0.5 μl of 10 mg/ml CHCA) was added. The sample-matrix mixture was dried at room temperature and then analyzed in reflector mode. CHCA was also spotted alone as a negative control. Spectra were the sum of 100 laser shots, and those peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 3:1 were selected for data base searching. Spectra were internally calibrated using autolytic trypsin peptides (m/z 842.51, 2211.10). The monoisotopic masses for each protonated peptide were: (a) entered into the program MS-Fit (available at prospector.ucsf.edu) for searches against the Swiss-Prot, NCBI, and GenPept databases, and (b) entered into Mascot (available at matrixscience.com), an algorithm testing statistical significance of peptide mass fingerprinting identifications. For MS-Fit searches, masses derived from trypsin, CHCA, keratin, and Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 were excluded. Search parameters included a maximum allowed peptide mass error of 0.1 Da (0.8 Da in the few instances in which linear mode was used), consideration of one incomplete cleavage per peptide, pI range of 3.0–10.0, and molecular mass range of 1–200 kDa. Accepted modifications included carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (from iodoacetamide exposure following IEF) (28Yan J.X. Sanchez J.C. Rouge V. Williams K.L. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and methionine oxidation, a common modification occurring during SDS-PAGE (29Mardian J.K. Isenberg I. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein identifications were assigned when three criteria were met: 1) statistical significance (p < 0.05) of the match when tested by Mascot (matrixscience.com); 2) >20% sequence coverage by the tryptic peptides; and 3) concordance (±15%) with the molecular weight and pI of the parent two-dimensional PAGE protein spot. The following special exceptions were considered: (a) protein identifications not fulfilling criterion 2 were still assigned if criteria 1 and 3 were fulfilled and no other Homo sapiensproteins with peptide mass-matched p values < 0.05 were identified by Mascot; (b) if criterion 3 was not fulfilled (lower than expected molecular weight), a cleavage product of the identified protein was inferred, and the cumulative molecular weight of the tryptic peptides was compared with that of the two-dimensional-PAGE spot to ensure that it was not exceeded; (c) if criterion 3 was not fulfilled (isolated discordance between theoretical and observed pI), post-translational modification of an unrecovered peptide was inferred; and (d) if two or more H. sapiens protein assignments with >4 mutually exclusive matching peptides were identified, a protein mixture in the two-dimensional PAGE spot was inferred and further analysis halted (quantitative conclusions regarding the individual protein constituents could not be drawn). Human PMNs were left untreated or incubated in the presence of 100 ng/ml LPS for 4 h. As a control to confirm that the PMNs were quiescent at baseline and that LPS resulted in normal stimulation, mRNA was isolated, cDNA was prepared, and PCR for TNF-α was performed. Little TNF-α expression was seen in nonstimulated cells, whereas LPS treatment led to an increase in expression in each of the donors subsequently used for microarray analysis (data not shown). No macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor transcript was detected by oligonucleotide microarray analysis, confirming there was no significant monocytic contamination. Human PMNs express a limited repertoire of mRNA transcripts at baseline but respond to LPS with differential expression of genes in many families. Considering only those genes present by microarray analysis in all three donors, unstimulated PMNs expressed 13.0% (923 of 7070 genes) of the Affymetrix gene set. Gene classes represented at baseline include metabolic enzymes, structural proteins, receptors, signaling proteins, and transcription factors. By comparison, human monocytes expressed ∼40% and human fibroblasts ∼35% of the represented genes (data not shown). By the criterion of a >3-fold increase in expression in all three donors on Affymetrix oligonucleotide array analysis, exposure of PMNs to LPS for 4 h resulted in the up-regulation of 100 genes (Table I).Table IHuman neutrophil genes induced after 4 h of LPS exposureDescriptionGenBank™ no.Change-foldTranscriptional regulationPleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 2D8378416.8NFKB2S7663812.3NFKBIEU9161611.5p65L190678.4BCL3U056817.7X-box binding protein 1M316277.5Metal-regulatory transcription factor 1X787107.4Ets-2J041027.4c-RelX750426.2NFKB1M586035.8Basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-likeU154604.7IKBM690433.8MAX dimerization proteinL068953.6DIF2S819143.1Cytokines and receptorsMCP-1M6920378.7MIP-1βM7288548.8αHelix coiled-coil rod homologAF01495820.8IL-1βX0450017.6GRO3 (beta)M5773117.3TNF-αX0291014.5MIP-3αU641978.1IL10RAU006727.3IL-6Y000816.3GROaX544894HM74D109233.8Immune responseOrosomucoidX0254420.2Complement component C3K0276512.8Protease inhibitor 9U713649.5Complement component 3a receptor 1U284886.1Protease inhibitor 3L103434.9SLPI/antileukoproteaseX044704.7ELANH2/elastase inhibitorM930564.6CD58Y006363.8Complement componentPFCM836523.5KinasesCNK/FNK/PLK-likeU5699816.2CotD1449711.9Pim-2U777359.5LIMK2D459064.3PhosphatasesPAC-1/DUSP2L1132911.8DUSP5U159325.3PHA1U734773.4Signaling moleculesTNFAIP1/A20M5946510TRAF1U192616.2RanBP2D420635.6GNA15M639045.2PTAFRD102023.9Adhesion and cytoskeletonICAM1M2428322.4CEACAM1 (bilary glycoprotein)X163546.3LIMS1U092846.1SNL/actin bundling proteinU030575.9Galectin-1/LGALS1M577104.7MEMD/ALCAMU309994.2CD44HG2981—HT31253.9TSG-6M311653.7MetabolicGTP cyclohydrolase IU1952313.5NDUFV2/ubiquinone reductaseM225388.6PSMA6/(proteosome iota)X594178.4UDP-galactose transporter (SLC35A2)D844547.3PLAU(urokinase)X024196.4KYNU/l-kynurenine hydrolaseU577215.5AMPD3D127755P4HA1/prolyl 4-hydroxylaseM244864.7γ Glutamylcysteine synthetaseL355464.5ATP6DJ056824.2ATP6S1D164694Glycerol kinaseX682853.6FACL1L092293.5AK3X606733.3Interferon-inducibleISG15M1375522.5Mx1M3388219.4IFI56M2459412.1INDOM344555.2GBPIM555424.3PRKRU506483.7IFIT4U525133.6IFI54M146603.5IFI58U346053.5IFP35U728823OtherGos2M7288548.8MIHC/IAP1U375467.2KIAA0105D146615.1KIAA0118D420875SNAP23U559365CASP5U280154.8KIAA0113D307554.8KIAA0255D874444.7Hepatoma-derived GFD164314.7PTGS2D282354.6CD48M377664.3UNC119 homologU409984.2KIAA0151D634853.9Rab1bXM0356603.8Annexin VIIJ045433.7KIAA0110D148113.7AdrenomedullinD148743.7AIM1U831153.6KIAA0250D874373.2P5–1L061753.2Scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cellsD634833.2VHLL154093.1 Open table in a new tab Genes from several different functional classes were induced in PMNs following LPS exposure. Of interest, a number of transcriptional regulators were induced, including transcription factors of the NF-κB family. The transcriptional NF-κB complex has previously been implicated in the regulation of the genes induced by LPS (11McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes for several cytokines and chemokines were also found to be up-regulated. These include TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-3α, and MIP-1β (Table I). PCR was performed to confirm the results from the microarray analysis. PCR analysis on selected genes indicates that the time course for changes can be rapid or delayed but parallel the changes found in the array at the 4-h time point (data not shown). Other up-regulated genes included those for metabolic enzymes, immune response molecules, kinases, phosphatases, signaling molecules, adhesion and cytoskeletal components, interferon-stimulated genes, and those with unknown or miscellaneous function (Table I). LPS stimulation of PMN also resulted in the down-regulation of 56 genes (Table II). Down-regulated genes were identified as transcriptional regulators, protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases, structural molecules, and signaling molecules. Genes for metabolic proteins were also evident, as were several uncharacterized genes.Table IIHuman neutrophil genes repressed (>4-fold) after 4 h of LPS exposureDescriptionGenBank™ no.Change-foldKinasesCAMK, II, gammaU50360−4Diacylglycerol kinase, deltaD63479−4.2PRKCL2/PRK2 protein kinase C-like 2U33052−4.3MAPKAPK3U09578−6.3Protein kinase Ht31, cAMP-dependentHG2167–HT2237−8CAMK IIL07044−9.8TransportersSLC25A5/solute carrier family 25, member 5J02683−4.2SLC19A1; folate transporterU17566−4.4SLC2A3; facilitated glucose transporterM20681−5MetabolicCarbonic anhydrase IVL10955−4.4RNase A family, k6U64998−4.5Glycogen phosphorylase; liverM14636−4.6Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphataseU57650−4.6Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinaseU51336−4.7TransketolaseL12711−4.8Protein phosphatase 4, reg. subunit 1 (clone 23840)U79267−4.9Cytidine deaminaseL27943−5.4MGAT1M55621−5.4HMOX1X06985−5.4MAN2A2L28821−5.8Glycogenin (also represents U31525)HG4334–HT4604−5.9StructuralFibrinogen-like protein (pT49 protein)Z36531−4.2H2AFZM37583−4.7PaxillinU14588−4.9Lamin B RL25931−5.9Dynamin 2L36983−6.2Actinin 1M95178−6.7α-TubulinX01703−10Tubulin, α1, isoform 44HG2259–HT2348−15Transcriptional regulatorsLymphoblastic leukemia-derived sequence 1M22638−4.4MAX-interacting protein 1L07648−4.5Nuclear factor crythroid 2isoform fS77763−6Transducer of ERBB2, 1D38305−6.9NFATC4L41067−7.8ATF-2 (CRE-Bpa)L05515−9.6ReceptorsLymphotoxin β receptorL04270−4.4Folate receptor 3(gamma)U08471−5U11875−5.3SignalingPix-α; cool-2(KIAA0006)D25304−4.5ARHB/RhoBM12174−4.5TNFSF10; TRAILU37518−6.6Ca2+bindingANXIIL19605−4.3S100A4M80563−4.8ANX1X05908−4.8OtherProteolipid protein 2L09604−4.9Protein phosphatase 1, α catalytic subunitHG1614–HT1614−5TIMP2M32304−5.1KIAA0199D83782−5.2Lipin 2(KIAA0249)D87436−5.6LRMP(Jaw1)U10485−5.8CUGBP2U69546−6.9Clone 23933U79273−7PECAM1L34657−8Delta sleep-inducing peptideZ50781−8.7DiGeorge synd. critical region gene 2(KIAA0163)D79985−9SELPLG; CD162; selectin P ligandU25956−32 Open table in a new tab In contrast to the limited number of transcripts found at baseline, PMNs were found to express a large number and variety of proteins in the nonstimulated state (Fig. 1, A and C, and Table III, Table IV, Table V). Reproducible protein expression patterns were found on the pH 3.0–10.0 gels, and the majority of proteins fell in the pH 5.0–7.0 range (Fig.1A). The basic region (pH > 7.0) consistently exhibited poor resolution, precluding meaningful image analysis and further workup (data not shown). Depending on the spot-finding parameters (minimum spot intensity, filter width) selected on the image analysis software, spot-by-spot manual editing was found to be necessary to avoid over- and underdetected spots; moreover, further manual editing was performed to screen for unmatched and mismatched spots following matching of paired control and LPS-stimulated gels. After spot editing, ∼1200 well-resolved spots were evident on each pH 3.0–10.0 gel. In an attempt to improve resolution of the pI range bearing the greatest number of well-resolved spots, overlapping narrow pH range gels (pH 5.0–6.0, 5.5–6.7, 6–11) were also run. Of interest, a similar number of well-resolved spots (∼1200) were detected on the narrow pH range gels (Fig. 1, C and D). Assuming a detection limit for Coomassie of 15 ng (0.25 pmol, or 1.5 × 1011 molecules, for a 60-kDa protein) and a protein load per gel corresponding to 75 × 106PMNs, we estimate a detection limit on our gels of 2000 molecules/cell for a 60-kDa protein. As investigators have suggested in other cell lines with the use of high resolution two-dimensional-PAGE methods (30Corthals G.L. Wasinger V.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Sanchez J.C.

Molecular cloning of GPVI has revealed the presence of a proline-rich domain in the sequence of GPVI cytoplasmic tail which has the consensus for interaction with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Fyn and Lyn. A series of in vitroexperiments demonstrated the ability of the SH3 domains of both Src kinases to bind the proline-rich domain of GPVI. Furthermore, depletion of the proline-rich domain in GPVI (Pro(−)-GPVI) prevented binding of Fyn and Lyn and markedly reduced phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, but did not affect the association of the γ-chain with GPVI. Jurkat cells stably transfected with wild type GPVI show robust increases in tyrosine phosphorylation and intracellular Ca2+ in response to the snake venom convulxin that targets GPVI. Importantly, convulxin is not able to activate cells transfected with Pro(−)-GPVI, even though the association with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing chains is maintained. These findings demonstrate that the proline-rich domain of GPVI mediates the association with Fyn/Lyn via their SH3 domain and that this interaction initiates activation signals through GPVI.

A maltose-binding protein (MBP)-GPVI fusion protein was prepared from cDNA encoding the GPVI cytoplasmic sequence Glu266-Ser316 (11Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J.

The construct encoded a fusion protein with the N-terminal region corresponding to Escherichia coli MBP and the GPVI sequence at the C terminus. The correct sequence was verified by sequencing. MBP and MBP-GPVI expressed in E. coli were purified on amylose-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). GST-SH3 domains of Fyn, Lyn, Src, Fgr, Btk, or PLCγ2 expressed in E. coli were purified on glutathione-agarose as described previously (19Gross B.S. Melford S.K. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, GST-Lyn-SH3 and GST-Src-SH3 were radioiodinated with sodium [125I]iodide using the chloramine-T method, and separated from free label on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) washed with TS buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) as previously described (21Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol.

Binding of GST-Src-SH3 or GST-Lyn-SH3 to MBP-GPVI cytoplamic domain fusion proteins or a synthetic peptide based on GPVI was assessed using a microtiter well assay as described elsewhere (22Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Gu M., Xi, X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, detachable microtiter wells (Immunlon-2 Remova-wells, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with MBP or MBP-GPVI (5 μg) in 50 μl of TS buffer by incubation at 22 °C overnight. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the GPVI cytoplasmic sequence His269-Ser316 (Chiron Mimotopes, Clayton, Australia) was solubilized in distilled water at 0.5 mm, and wells coated overnight at 22 °C with 50 μl of a 1:10 dilution in 0.05 m NaHCO3, pH 9.2. MBP, MBP-GPVI, or His269-Ser316 peptide-coated wells were incubated at 22 °C with 5% (w/v) BSA in TS buffer for 2 h, then washed 4 times with 0.1 ml of TS buffer. To each well was added 200 μl of 125I-labeled GST-Lyn-SH3 or GST-Src-SH3 (final concentration, 1 μg/ml) in TS buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Parallel assays included a 50-fold excess of unlabeled GST-Lyn-SH3 or GST-Src-SH3, or GPVI synthetic peptide Val282-Ser298 (5–100 μm). After 30 min at 22 °C, the supernatant was aspirated, and bound radioactivity counted in a γ-counter. Platelets were obtained from drug-free volunteers on the day of the experiment and suspended in Tyrodes-Hepes buffer (134 mm NaCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3). They were isolated and stimulated as described previously (20Asazuma N. Wilde J.I. Berlanga O. Leduc M. Leo A. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Bon C. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Schraven B. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33427-33434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Stimulations were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.3). 2.5 × 108 platelets, 2–9 × 106Jurkat cells, or COS-7 cells were used for immunoprecipitation. Detergent-insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant precleared with protein A-Sepharose (50% (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (TBS-T: 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6)) for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies and protein A-Sepharose were added and each sample rotated at 4 °C overnight. The Sepharose pellet was washed sequentially in lysis buffer and TBS-T, before the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Where indicated, the proteins were dissolved using Laemmli sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol (non-reducing condition). Precipitation of proteins with the fusion construct was performed as described previously (19Gross B.S. Melford S.K. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 15% gels, electrotransferred, and blotted as described previously (20Asazuma N. Wilde J.I. Berlanga O. Leduc M. Leo A. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Bon C. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Schraven B. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33427-33434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For GPVI detection, membranes were incubated with 10 μg/ml convulxin for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-convulxin antibody as described previously (24Berlanga O. Bobe R. Becker M. Murphy G. Leduc M. Bon C. Barry F.A. Gibbins J.M. Garcia P. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPVI was precipitated using its ligand, convulxin. Cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg/ml convulxin for 2 h. 1:10,000 anti-convulxin antibody and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose were then added. COS-7 cells was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. Both mediums contain 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Before the experiment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Tyrodes-Hepes buffer. Cells were detached by adding trypsin-EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37 °C before washing. The cDNA for human GPVI was subcloned intoHindIII/XbaI sites of pRc plasmid (FLAG-tagged). The construct encoded a fusion protein with the N-terminal region corresponding to human GPVI and FLAG sequence at the C terminus. The cDNA for the human FcR γ-chain was subcloned into pMG (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) and the cDNAs for Lyn or Fyn were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The constructs for Lyn or Fyn encode a fusion protein with the N-terminal region corresponding to Lyn or Fyn and the C-terminal region corresponding to Myc. All sequences were verified by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis of GPVI was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (see Fig. 3). The oligonucleotide used for the proline-rich domain-deleted GPVI was 5′-gcagaggccgcttcagacccggaaatcac-3′. For stable transfections, 1 × 107 Jurkat cells were washed once with serum-free medium and once with cytomix buffer (0.119m KCl, 91 μm CaCl2, 9.76 mm K2HPO4, 10.2 mmKH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, 2.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6) which was supplemented on the day of experiment with 0.37 mg/ml glutathione. Cells were resuspended in 400-μl cytomics and placed into an electroporation cuvette already containing 40 μg of DNA. Cells were electroporated, added to 15 ml of completed medium, and incubated for 48 h before selection by 500 μg/ml neomycin (G418). Surface expression of normal GPVI or proline-rich domain-deleted GPVI was confirmed by flow cytometry using convulxin and anti-convulxin antibody as described previously (24Berlanga O. Bobe R. Becker M. Murphy G. Leduc M. Bon C. Barry F.A. Gibbins J.M. Garcia P. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transient transfections, 5 μg of each DNA (pRc alone or pRc containing GPVI, proline-rich domain-deleted GPVI, Fyn, Lyn, or FcR γ-chain) was added to the buffer containing 252 mm CaCl2 and 240 μmchloroquine. Then, 500 μl of 2 × HBS buffer (280 mmNaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, 50 mm HEPES, 12 mm dextrose, pH 7.5) was added to the DNA mixture drop by drop. Fifteen hours after adding this transfection mixture to COS-7 cells, the medium containing DNA was removed and completed medium was added. After 24 h, transfected cells were used for experimentation. Intracellular calcium mobilization was measured in Jurkat cells (2 × 106/ml) suspended in Tyrodes buffer containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 upon convulxin stimulation as described previously (25Quek L.S. Pasquet J.M. Hers I. Cornall R. Knight G. Barnes M. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Lowell C.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were resuspended in Tyrodes-Hepes buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. All incubation times were performed for 30 min unless otherwise indicated. For GPVI detection, Jurkat cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml convulxin, washed, and incubated with 0.4 μg/ml anticonvulxin antibody, washed again, and finally incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:500. Stained cells were analyzed immediately using a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). Data were recorded and analyzed using CellQuest software. We used a MBP cytoplasmic tail of GPVI fusion protein to investigate whether Src kinases associate with the proline-rich region in GPVI via their SH3 domains. Binding of the 125I-labeled GST fusion proteins of SH3 domains of Lyn and Src kinases to the MBP-GPVI tail fusion protein was displaced by an excess of the corresponding unlabeled fusion protein, whereas there was no specific binding to MBP itself (Fig.1A). These findings demonstrate that Src kinases are able to bind the GPVI tail via their SH3 domains. A proline-rich peptide (Val282-Ser298) based on the GPVI tail was used to investigate whether this is able to displace the binding of the 125I-labeled GST-Lyn-SH3 to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the GPVI cytoplasmic sequence His269-Ser316. Binding of125I-labeled GST-Lyn-SH3 to the GPVI cytoplasmic sequence was inhibited to a similar extent by an excess of the proline-rich peptide or the unlabeled GST fusion protein (Fig. 1B, i). The IC50 for displacement by the peptide was ∼6 μm (Fig. 1B, ii). These results demonstrate that the SH3 domains of the Src family kinases are able to bind to the proline-rich domain of the GPVI tail. The ability of the SH3 domains of Src kinases to bind GPVI was further investigated using platelet lysates. GST fusion proteins of the SH3 domains of the Src kinases Lyn, Fyn, Src, and Fgr bound similar levels of GPVI in control and convulxin-stimulated platelets, as measured by ligand blotting using convulxin, whereas there was no specific binding to GST alone or the SH3 domains of PLCγ2 and Btk (Fig.1C). These observations confirm the ability of the GPVI tail to selectively associate with the SH3 domains of Src kinases in vitro. The association of Src kinases with the GPVI·FcR γ-chain complex in platelets was investigated through immunoprecipitation of the glycoprotein receptor combined with Western blotting for Src kinases. In agreement with the results of Ezumiet al. (8Ezumi Y. Shindoh K. Tsuji M. Takayama H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we observed a specific association of Fyn and Lyn (Fig. 2A), but not Src (Fig. 2B) with this complex in resting platelets. We also confirmed the absence of Fyn or Lyn association with control mouse IgG immunoprecipitates (data not shown). A small increase (<30%) in association with both kinases was observed after a delay of ∼20 s was seen in some but not all experiments. These findings demonstrate that Fyn and Lyn associate with GPVI·FcR γ-chain complex in platelets and that an increase in this association is an early response to GPVI stimulation. However, these results do not provide information on the site of association of Src kinases within this receptor complex, bearing in mind that Src kinases have also been reported to bind non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated ITAMs (26Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar, 28Osman N. Lucas S. Cantrell D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Fyn and Lyn associate directly with the SH3 domain of GPVI in vivo, we used COS-7 cells reconstituted with wild type GPVI (WT-GPVI) and a receptor mutant lacking the proline-rich domain (Pro(−)-GPVI; see Fig.3A). Both forms of GPVI were tagged with FLAG at the C terminus to facilitate analysis through precipitation. Western blotting studies using convulxin and an antibody to convulxin demonstrated that COS-7 cells express similar levels of WT- and Pro(−)-GPVI on their surface despite the absence of the FcR γ-chain (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of WT-GPVI with an anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated a direct association with co-transfected Fyn and Lyn (Fig. 3, B and C). In sharp contrast, there was only minimal association of the two Src kinases with Pro(−)-GPVI despite a similar level of expression of the glycoprotein and the two Src kinases in the transfected cells (Fig. 3, B and C). These findings demonstrate a direct association of Fyn and Lyn with GPVI in vivo and confirm that the proline-rich domain is critical for this interaction. We then used COS-7 cells expressing WT or Pro(−)-GPVI and co-transfected FcR γ-chain to investigate whether the association with Lyn and Fyn is necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain ITAM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of γ-chain was measured by Western blotting following precipitation with a GST fusion protein of the tandem SH2 domains of Syk which selectively binds tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs (30Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). There was no phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain in the absence of Fyn or Lyn in either WT- or Pro(−)-GPVI expressing cells (not shown). In contrast, the FcR γ-chain was tyrosine phosphorylated under non-stimulated conditions in COS-7 cells transfected with WT-GPVI and Lyn or Fyn but not in cells transfected with Pro(−)-GPVI and either Src kinase (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain was increased in WT-GPVI expressing cells stimulated by convulxin, whereas there was only a marginal change in cells expressing the Pro(−) mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). Importantly, the association of the FcR γ-chain with GPVI was similar in both the WT- and Pro(−)-expressing cells as revealed by FLAG precipitation and convulxin blotting for the FcR γ-chain (Fig.4C). This demonstrates that the reduced level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain in Pro(−)-GPVI-transfected cells is not due to disruption of the GPVI-FcR γ-chain complex. These results demonstrate that the proline-rich domain of GPVI is necessary for interaction with Fyn and Lyn and for subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain upon activation by convulxin. Many of the proteins present in the GPVI signaling cascade are restricted to the hematopoietic cell lineage and are therefore absent in COS-7 cells. Because of this, it was important to extend these studies to cells of an hematopoeitic background. Available immortalized megakaryocytic-like cells, however, express low levels of endogenous GPVI and/or are not readily susceptible to transfection using standardized methodology. For these reasons, we chose to express WT-GPVI and Pro(−)-GPVI in human Jurkat T cells. It is not necessary to co-transfect the FcR γ-chain to obtain functional responses as GPVI associates with the ITAM-containing ζ-chains in this cell (16Berlanga O. Tulasne D. Bori-Sanz T. Snell D.C. Miura Y. Jung S. Moroi M. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem.,. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 32Andrews R.K. Gardiner E.E. Asazuma N. Berlanga O. Tulasne D. Nieswandt B. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28092-28097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, Jurkat cells express the Src kinases Lck and FynT (31Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The snake toxin convulxin stimulated a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ and whole tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat cells stably transfected with WT-GPVI but not with Pro(−)-GPVI (Fig. 5A), despite similar levels of receptor expression at the cell surfaces as demonstrated by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). The G protein-coupled agonist thrombin stimulated a brisk increase of intracellular calcium in Jurkat cells transfected with Pro(−)-GPVI (Fig. 5B, ii), demonstrating that expression of the glycoprotein receptor mutant had not interfered with the Ca2+-releasing machinery. In addition, protein tyrosine phosphorylation increased in convulxin-stimulated Jurkat cells with WT-GPVI, but not in those with Pro(−)-GPVI (Fig. 5C). A similar level of association of the ζ-chain was seen with WT- and Pro(−)-GPVI in transfected Jurkat cells, whereas the ITAM-containing protein was not precipitated in untransfected cells (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that the proline-rich domain in GPVI is required for ITAM phosphorylation and downstream responses in an hematopoietic cell line. We have demonstrated that the proline-rich region in the GPVI tail associates with the SH3 domains of Fyn and Lyn and have presented evidence in support of a critical role for this interaction in mediating signaling by the receptor. These observations extend a number of previous studies proposing a role for the two Src family kinases in mediating GPVI-dependent phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain ITAM by providing a molecular basis for this interaction (12Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T., Le Couedic J.P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L.

The results suggest a model in which cross-linking of the glycoprotein receptor brings Fyn and Lyn to the FcR γ-chain ITAM leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and initiation of downstream events through the tyrosine kinase Syk. Several lines of evidence support a direct association of Src kinases with the proline-rich region in GPVI. Src kinases were found to bind to a chimera of MBP and the GPVI tail but not to MBP alone, and to a peptide containing the proline-rich region of GPVI. In addition, the SH3 domains of several Src kinases, but not those of Btk and PLCγ2, precipitated GPVI from control and stimulated platelets. Furthermore, the proline-rich domain of GPVI (RPLPPLPPLP) has the consensus sequence for binding to SH3 domains of the Src kinases (17Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). A direct association of the Lyn and Fyn kinases in a cellular environment with GPVI was confirmed by transient transfection studies in COS-7 cells, which lack the FcR γ-chain. The functional significance of this interaction was demonstrated using COS-7 and Jurkat cells transfected with WT- and Pro(−)-GPVI. Cells transfected with WT-GPVI, but not Pro(−)-GPVI, exhibited a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain ITAM and intracellular calcium mobilization. Importantly, the association of WT- and Pro(−)-GPVI with FcR γ-chain or ζ-chain was similar in COS-7 and Jurkat cells, respectively. Src kinases are known to associate with a number of immune receptors and to play an important role in initiating signals. In Jurkat cells, Fyn and Lck associate with the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex and CD4, respectively, and it has been proposed that these associations mediate phosphorylation of the CD3- and ζ-chain ITAMs (34Ledbetter J.A. Deans J.P. Aruffo A. Grosmaire L.S. Kanner S.B. Bolen J.B. Schieven G.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35zur Hausen J.D. Burn P. Amrein K.E. Eur. J.

Fyn and Lck interact directly with CD3 and CD4 complex via their N-terminal unique domains, respectively (34Ledbetter J.A. Deans J.P. Aruffo A. Grosmaire L.S. Kanner S.B. Bolen J.B. Schieven G.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35zur Hausen J.D. Burn P. Amrein K.E. Eur. J.

In addition, the N-terminal unique domains of the two Src kinases provide a signal for fatty acid acylation and specific plasma membrane localization, which may also serve to stabilize the interactions between the Fyn SH2 domain and phosphotyrosines in TCR ζ-chain ITAMs (35zur Hausen J.D. Burn P. Amrein K.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CD3 ε-chain has a cluster of proline residues although, as yet, it is not known whether Fyn or Lck associates with this region via their SH3 domain. However, Denny et al. (37Denny M.F. Kaufman H.C. Chan A.C. Straus D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5146-5152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that expression of SH3 domain-deleted Lck in an Lck-deficient T cell line inhibited activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but not tyrosine phosphorylation of ζ-chain. This demonstrates that the SH3 domain-proline-rich domain interaction is dispensable for T cell receptor signaling. In B cells, Lyn and Fyn are reported to associate with a short sequence, Asp-Cys-Ser-Met, within the Ig-α chain of the B cell antigen complex via their unique N terminals (26Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have proposed a model in which the association of Src kinases with the proline-rich region of GPVI is necessary for ITAM phosphorylation. The SH3 domains of Src family kinases have been proposed to be autoinhibitory. X-ray crystallographic studies of Src and Hck revealed that the SH3 domain mediates an intramolecular interaction with an atypical binding site in the region linking the SH2 and kinase domains (38Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 39Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Erpel et al. (40Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) have reported that inactivating the SH3 domain of Src induces an 8–10-fold elevation of its kinase activity. Based on these findings, it seems likely that binding of the SH3 domain of Fyn and Lyn to the GPVI tail will increase their intrinsic activity. Since platelets need to be activated promptly upon platelet adhesion to collagen in subendothelium at the site of vessel damage, Src kinases may need to be “ready-to-go” even before stimulation. On the other hand, immune cells do not need to react so promptly to external stimuli, and, moreover, it may be favorable to have Src kinases in a “low” state of reactivity to avoid unwanted activation. Nevertheless, it is important to investigate whether proline-rich regions in other immune receptors are important for mediating activation signals. In conclusion, we have shown that the proline-rich domain of the GPVI tail is necessary for the association with Src kinases via their SH3 domain and for mediating activation. This study therefore demonstrates a novel pathway of regulation of ITAM phosphorylation by an Ig domain containing receptor. We are grateful to Drs. S. J. Shattil, C. Kinnon, B. Schraven, P. Lock, M.

Levels of p66Shc expression correlate with life span duration in mice. p46Shc and p52Shc are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p66Shc is expressed in a cell lineage-specific fashion. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of Shc protein expression are unknown. Here we report the identification of two alternative promoters, driving the transcription of two mRNAs coding for p46/p52Shc and p66Shc. We show that treatment with an inhibitor of histone deacetylases or with a demethylating agent results in induction of p66Shc expression in cells that normally do not express this isoform but leaves the levels of the two other isoforms unchanged. Moreover, analysis of the methylation pattern of the p66Shc promoter in a panel of primary and immortalized human cells showed inverse correlation between p66Shc expression and methylation density of its promoter. These results identify histone deacetylation and cytosine methylation as the mechanisms underlying p66Shc silencing in nonexpressing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972959575,"Three major PITX2 isoforms are differentially expressed in human, mice, zebrafish, chick, and frog tissues. To demonstrate differential regulation of gene expression by these isoforms we used three different promoters and three cell lines. Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary, HeLa, and LS-8 cell lines revealed differences in PITX2A and PITX2C activation of thePLOD1 and Dlx2 promoters, however, PITX2B is inactive. In contrast, PITX2B actives the pituitary-specificProlactin promoter at higher levels than either PITX2A or PITX2C. Interestingly, co-transfection of either PITX2A orPITX2C with PITX2B results in a synergistic activation of the PLOD1 and Dlx2 promoters. Furthermore, PITX2 isoforms have different transcriptional activity dependent upon the cells used for transfection analysis. We have isolated a fourth PITX2 isoform (PITX2D) expressed only in humans, which acts to suppress the transcriptional activity of the other PITX2 isoforms. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrated that all isoforms interact with PITX2D and that PITX2B forms heterodimeric complexes with PITX2A and PITX2C. Our research provides a molecular basis for differential gene regulation through the expression of PITX2 isoforms.

We and others have identified three major PITX2 isoforms produced by alternative splicing and use of different promoters (4Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J. Alward L.M. Small K.W. Datson N.A.

PITX2A and PITX2B are generated by alternative splicing mechanisms, and PITX2C uses an alternative promoter located upstream of exon 4 (see Fig. 1 below). All isoforms contain dissimilar N-terminal domains, whereas the homeodomain and C-terminal domains are identical. The C-terminal domain contains a highly conserved 14-amino acid region described in the homeobox genesOtp and aristaless (4Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J. Alward L.M. Small K.W. Datson N.A. Siegel-Bartelt J. Bierke-Nelson D. Bitoun P. Zabel B.U. Carey J.C. Murray J.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 6Gage P.J. Camper S.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which is called the OAR (Otp and aristaless) domain. Recent reports have provided evidence of Pitx2 isoform regulation in left-right asymmetry (23Essner J.J. Branford W.W. Zhang J. Yost H.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu C. Liu W., Lu, M. Brown N.A. Martin J.F. Dev. 2001; 128: 2039-2048PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yu X., St. Amand T.R. Wang S., Li, G. Zhang Y., Hu, Y. Nguyen L. Qiu M. Chen Y. Development. 2001; 128: 1005-1013PubMed Google Scholar). Epigenetic and genetic studies reveal that tissue and organ developments are differentially regulated byPitx2a and Pitx2c isoforms. In the chick it appears that Pitx2c plays a crucial role in the left-right axis determination and rightward heart looping during chick embryogenesis (25Yu X., St. Amand T.R. Wang S., Li, G. Zhang Y., Hu, Y. Nguyen L. Qiu M. Chen Y. Development. 2001; 128: 1005-1013PubMed Google Scholar). However, these researchers were unable to detect the Pitx2b isoform in chicks. Zebrafish are somewhat different in that Pitx2a has a greater impact on cardiac symmetry than Pitx2c (23Essner J.J. Branford W.W. Zhang J. Yost H.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Zebrafish Pitx2c is asymmetrically expressed in the left dorsal diencephalon and developing gut, whereas Pitx2a is seen in the left heart primordium. Eloquent experiments in mice that were defective in Pitx2aand Pitx2b expression demonstrate that different organs have distinct requirements for Pitx2c dosage (24Liu C. Liu W., Lu, M. Brown N.A. Martin J.F. Dev. 2001; 128: 2039-2048PubMed Google Scholar). These researchers have shown that lower levels of Pitx2cexpression were required for cardiac atria and higher levels for duodenum and lung development. In contrast, other investigators have reported expression of Pitx2c and Pitx2b but notPitx2a in mice and frogs (26Schweickert A. Campione M. Steinbeisser H. Blum M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). They report overlapping and distinct patterns of Pitx2 expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, heart, gut, cement gland, head mesenchyma, pituitary gland, branchial arches, myotome, and muscles. Pitx2c andPitx2b were expressed in the head region of mice, and overlapping expression patterns were seen in the brain of frogs. However, they report only Pitx2c expression was observed during heart development in both the mouse and frog (26Schweickert A. Campione M. Steinbeisser H. Blum M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Other experiments in mice have shown Pitx2 expression in the odontogenic epithelium, and it is the first transcriptional marker of tooth development (27Mucchielli M.-L. Mitsiadis T.A. Raffo S. Brunet J.-F. Proust J.-P. Goridis C. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that Pitx2 protein is restricted to the developing dental epithelium (28Hjalt T.A. Semina E.V. Amendt B.A. Murray J.C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Altogether these data demonstrate that Pitx2 isoforms are required either separately or in overlapping domains and in different doses to regulate normal vertebrate heart, lung, brain, tooth, pituitary, and gut development. However, the biochemical/molecular mechanisms of these effects have not been determined. Target genes for PITX2 have been described for the pituitary; theProlactin gene is synergistically activated by Pit-1 and PITX2 (3Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Semina E. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20066-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Other pituitary-specific Pitx2 target genes have also been described (29Tremblay J.J. Goodyer C.G. Drouin J. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 71: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, we have now identified two genes outside of the pituitary that are specifically regulated by PITX2. We have shown that PITX2 regulates procollagen lysyl hydroxylase (PLOD) and Dlx2 gene expression (30Hjalt T.A. Amendt B.A. Murray J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Green P.D. Hjalt T.A. Kirk D.E. Sutherland L.B. Thomas B.L. Sharpe P.T. Snead M.L. Murray J.C. Russo A.F. Amendt B.A. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The PLOD1 gene encodes an enzyme responsible for hydroxylizing lysines in collagens that plays a role in specifying the extracellular matrix and provides a foundation for the morphogenesis of tissues and organs. TheDlx2 gene encodes a transcription factor expressed in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the mandibular and maxillary regions and expressed in the diencephalon. Dlx2, a member of the distal-less gene family, has been established as a regulator of branchial arch development (32Qiu M. Bulfone A. Martinez S. Meneses J.J. Shimamura K. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2523-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 33Thomas B.L. Liu J.K. Rubenstein J.L.R. Sharpe P.T. Development. 2000; 127: 217-224PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous mutants ofDlx2 have abnormal development of forebrain cells and craniofacial abnormalities in developing neural tissue. Dlxgenes exhibit both sequential and overlapping expression, implying that temporo-spatial regulation of Dlx genes are tightly regulated (34Liu J.K. Ghattas I. Liu S. Chen S. Rubenstein J.L.R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 498-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Pitx2 and Dlx2 genes are expressed in the same tissues early during development. These reports establish that the PITX2 family ofbicoid-like homeodomain genes are key regulators of important development processes and are required to regulate specific genes during embryogenesis. Our studies demonstrate differential activation of the PLOD1 and Dlx2 promoters by PITX2 isoforms in several cell lines. We demonstrate synergism between PITX2 isoforms, and their activities appear to be promoter-dependent. We report the identification of a newPITX2 isoform (PITX2D) generated by thePITX2C alternative promoter and differential splicing (Fig.1). We have only observed this isoform expressed in humans, and it was identified from a human craniofacial library. The PITX2D isoform acts to down-regulate the transcriptional activities of PITX2A and PITX2C. All isoforms can form homodimers, and heterodimers are formed with PITX2B. We demonstrate new regulatory mechanisms for the fine-tuning of PITX2 transcriptional activity that is required for normal development. Our data provide a molecular/biochemical basis for the developmental regulation of organ and tissue development by PITX2 isoforms reported in humans, zebrafish, chicks, frogs, and mice. The PITX2A isoform was PCR-amplified from a cDNA clone as described (3Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Semina E. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20066-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The PITX2B, PITX2C, and PITX2D isoforms were PCR-amplified from cDNA clones provided by Drs. Elena Semina and Jeff Murray (Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa). The 5′-primers all contained the initiation codon and a uniqueSalI site, whereas the 3′-antisense primer contained PITX2 sequences downstream of the stop codon and a unique NotI site (5′-GTACTGCAGATGCGGCCGCAGCATAATTCCCAGTC-3′) to facilitate cloning into the pGEX6P-2 GST1 vector (AmershamBiosciences) as previously described (3Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 5′-primers were unique for each isoform and consisted of the following: PITX2B (5′-CGTCGTCGACATGGAGACCAATTGTCGC-3′), PITX2C (5′-CGTCGTCGACATGAACTGCATGAAAGGC-3′), PITX2D (5′-CGTCGTCGACATGTCCACACGCGAAGAA-3′). All pGST-PITX2 plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transformed into BL21 cells. Proteins were isolated as described previously (3Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Semina E. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20066-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PITX2 proteins were cleaved from the GST moiety using 80 units of PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) per milliliter of glutathione-Sepharose. The cleaved proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantitated by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Complementary oligonucleotides containing the Dlx2 bicoid andbicoid-like sites with flanking partial BamHI ends were annealed and filled with Klenow polymerase to generate32P-labeled probes for EMSAs, as described previously (31Green P.D.

Standard binding assays were performed as previously described (35Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Russo A.F. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1999; 19: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The bacteria-expressed and -purified PITX2 proteins were used in the assays at the indicated amounts. The samples were electrophoresed, visualized, and quantitated as described previously, except quantitation of dried gels was performed on the Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) (31Green P.D. Hjalt T.A. Kirk D.E. Sutherland L.B. Thomas B.L. Sharpe P.T. Snead M.L. Murray J.C. Russo A.F. Amendt B.A. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immobilized GST-PITX2D fusion protein was prepared as described above and suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% milk, and 400 μg/ml ethidium bromide). Purified bacteria-expressed PITX2 proteins (200 ng) were added to 5 μg of immobilized GST-PITX2D fusion proteins or GST in a total volume of 100 μl and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed four times with 200 μl of binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Approximately 200 ng of purified PITX2 proteins were analyzed in separate Western blots. Following SDS-gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore), immunoblotted, and detected using PITX2 antibody P2R10 (28Hjalt T.A. Semina E.V.

The homeobox sequence of thePITX2 gene was PCR-amplified using the primers, sense, 5′-caggggaagaatgaggacgt-3′, and antisense, 5′-gaagccattcttgcatagct-3′, and the PITX2A plasmid as a template (4Semina E.V.

The 175-bp fragment containing sequences of the first exon of the PITX2D isoform was PCR-amplified using the primers, sense, 5′-ctgagctgcggcaaggc-3′, and antisense, 5′-ggcagccctgacagagatg-3′, and the PITX2D plasmid as a template (this report). The PCR fragments were separated by electrophoresis in agarose gel and extracted from the gel, and DNA was cleaned using a Qiagen gel extraction kit and labeled with32P using a random-prime labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The following cDNA libraries were screened: human craniofacial (constructed from mRNA derived from the craniofacial region of human embryos ranging from 42- to 53-day gestation (36Padanilam B.J.

The hybridization, washing, exposure, identification of the positive clones, excision, and sequencing procedures were performed as previously described (4Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J.

The exon-intron boundaries were identified by comparison of the identified cDNA and the PITX2 genomic sequence. By using the 266-bp homeobox sequence of the PITX2 as a probe, we identified multiple positive clones that can be divided into seven groups: sequences of PITX2 isoform A, PITX2isoform B, PITX2 isoform C,PITX2 isoform D, partial PITX2sequences that can be attributed to any isoform, and various sequences belonging to either the PITX1 or PITX3genes. The PITX2 A–C isoforms were described before (4Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J. Alward L.M. Small K.W. Datson N.A. Siegel-Bartelt J. Bierke-Nelson D. Bitoun P. Zabel B.U. Carey J.C. Murray J.C.

The PITX2D isoform was only identified from the human craniofacial library: two independent clones were isolated from the 3 × 106 clones examined. ThePITX2D sequence consists of three exons: the first exon (178 bp), which was found to be located 230-bp upstream of the first exon of the PITX2C isoform as it was identified from the human craniofacial library; the second exon (77 bp) representing a partial sequence of the PITX2 exon 5 lacking 129 of its 5′-nucleotides; and the third exon (1258 bp) that is equivalent to thePITX2 exon 6 (Fig. 1). By searching GenBankTM, we identified that the first exon of the PITX2D isoform was found to be a part of the first exon of the PITX2C isoform in two independent submissions: IMAGE 3937807 clone isolated from the lung library and ARP1C(PITX2C) cDNA. Sequences at the exon/intron junctions for the PITX2D were identified for the 5′-splice site, GGGCTGCCGC/gt, and for the 3′-splice site, cactttcc/AGAGGAACAGC. It is notable that the nucleotides at positions −1 and −2 of the 3′-splice site (CC) do not correspond with the conserved sequence identified as AG. The PITX2D isoform is predicted to encode the 205-amino acid protein with the initiation codon for methionine (ATG) located at the beginning of the second helix sequence of the homeobox. Additional screening of the above described libraries with the fragment containing the first exon sequence of the PITX2D isoform failed to identify any clones from the mouse cDNA libraries as well as any additional clones from the human craniofacial cDNA library. Expression plasmids containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter linked to the PITX2 DNA were constructed in pcDNA 3.1 MycHisC (Invitrogen) (35Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Russo A.F. Mol. Cel.

Electroporation of CHO cells was performed at 360 V and 950 microfarads (Bio-Rad), and electroporation of HeLa cells was at 220 V and 950 microfarads. The cells were fed 24 h prior to transfection.

To gain insight into its in vivo function, IQGAP1 was overexpressed in mammalian cells. Transfection of IQGAP1 significantly increased the levels of active, GTP-bound Cdc42, resulting in the formation of peripheral actin microspikes. By contrast, transfection of an IQGAP1 mutant lacking part of theGAP-related domain (IQGAP1ΔGRD) substantially decreased the amount of GTP-bound Cdc42 in cell lysates. Consistent with these findings, IQGAP1ΔGRD blocked Cdc42 function in cells that stably overexpress constitutively active Cdc42 and abrogated the effect of bradykinin on Cdc42. In cells transfected with IQGAP1ΔGRD, bradykinin was unable to activate Cdc42, translocate Cdc42 to the membrane fraction, or induce filopodia production. IQGAP1ΔGRD transfection altered cellular morphology, producing small, round cells that closely resemble Cdc42−/− cells.

Inactive Rho proteins are found associated with the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, RhoGDI.1 This complex is targeted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which activate Rho GTPases by promoting a GDP to GTP exchange. Inactivation is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which increase the intrinsic hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP (4Hall A.

Recent studies have suggested a role for IQGAP1 as a molecular link between active Cdc42 and the actin cytoskeleton (16Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J.

For example, upon induction of actin polymerization, both IQGAP1 and Cdc42 are incorporated into actin-containing complexes (19Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Hart M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24443-24447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 also has cross-linking activity toward F-actin that is augmented by active, GTP-bound Cdc42 (20Fukata M. Kuroda S. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Shoji I. Matsuura Y.Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29579-29583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). There is, however, limited information regarding the in vivo function of IQGAP1 in mammalian cells. Recent data reveal that microinjection of human IQGAP1 intoXenopus embryos generated superficial ectodermal lesions in a Cdc42-dependent manner (21Sokol S.Y., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48425-48430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of IQGAP1 in mammalian cells, we overexpressed wild type and mutant IQGAP1 constructs in several cell types. IQGAP1 overexpression significantly increased active Cdc42 in mammalian cell lysates. By contrast, an IQGAP1 mutant lacking part of the GRD (IQGAP1ΔGRD, residues 1122–1324 deleted) increased the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42, thereby reducing the amount of active Cdc42 in cells. Importantly, IQGAP1ΔGRD prevented bradykinin-mediated activation of Cdc42, translocation of Cdc42 to the membrane fraction, and formation of filopodia. Expression of IQGAP1ΔGRD also decreased active Cdc42 and abrogated microspike formation in cells overexpressing constitutively active Cdc42. Together, these data strongly suggest that IQGAP1 is an important link between Cdc42 and the cytoskeleton in cells. Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from BioWhittaker. Anti-Cdc42, Rac, and Rho antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-myc monoclonal antibodies (9E10.2) were manufactured by Maine Biotechnology and anti-myc polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibody has been previously characterized (15Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

HEK-293H cells were obtained from Invitrogen. T47D cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, COS-7 cells, and HEK-293H were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. MCF-7 cells and COS-7 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously described (17Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M.G. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). HEK-293H cells and T47D cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When analyzing dose-dependent effects, an appropriate amount of empty vector was added to each condition so that the total amount of DNA in each transfection was the same. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-myc-IQGAP1 using FuGENE6. Clones were isolated and selected in DMEM containing 800 μg/ml Geneticin (G418). Following subcloning of several individual clones, expression of myc-IQGAP1 was analyzed by Western blotting. One clone, termed MCF-7/IQGAP1–3F, which overexpresses IQGAP1 3-fold compared with vector-transfected MCF-7 cells (data not shown), was utilized in this work. A myc-tagged wild type human IQGAP1 in a pcDNA3 vector was used (14Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 15Ho Y.-D.

IQGAP1ΔGRDF, which lacks the entire GRD (residues 982–1248 deleted), was constructed as follows. pcDNA3-myc-IQGAP1 was cut with EaeI and AflII, and the blunt ends were generated with T4 polymerase. Following digestion withEco47III and XhaI, a 487-base pairEco47III-EaeI fragment and a 1836-base pairAflII-XhaI fragment were purified. pcDNA3-myc-IQGAP1 was cut with Eco47III andXhaI, and a 7839-base pairXhaI-Eco47III fragment was purified. All three fragments were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. A dual promoter vector that co-expresses GFP and wild type IQGAP1 was generated as described (23Briggs M.W., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7453-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, pcDNA3-IQGAP1 and pEGFP were digested, and the resultant fragments were made blunt-ended and ligated. A plasmid containing both reading frames in the same orientation was identified by restriction analysis and selected for use. All plasmids were purified using Qiagen DNA Purification kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced to verify mutagenesis. MBP-Cdc42 was constructed as follows. pMAL-C2X was digested withPstI, and the blunt ends were generated by T4 polymerase. The Cdc42 gene was excised from pGEX-cdc42 (generously provided by Dr. Matthew Hart) with EcoRI, and the blunt ends were generated with T4 polymerase and digested with BamHI. Fragments were purified from low melting point agarose and inserted into pMAL-C2X at the BamHI and PstI site. Sequence orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping, and the DNA insert region was sequenced to establish that MBP and Cdc42 were cloned in-frame. MBP-Cdc42 was expressed from this plasmid inEscherichia coli strain BL21 grown in 1 liter of Luria broth. Bacteria were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3.5 h and were then lysed by sonication in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA). Insoluble material was pelleted, and the supernatant was loaded onto amylose resin columns. After washing with buffer A, MBP-Cdc42 was eluted with 10 mm maltose and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 145 mmNaCl, 12 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mm Na2H2PO4, pH 7.2) containing 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol.

Briefly, MCF-7 or HEK-293H cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in 500 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmMgCl2, and protease inhibitors) containing 20 μm GTP. Cell lysates were quick-frozen, thawed, sonicated at 4 °C, and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of lysate were pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. An equal aliquot of each sample (50 μg) was examined directly as whole cell lysate and equal amounts of protein were incubated with 40 μg of GST-WASP-GBD for 2 h at 4 °C. Following collection of complexes with glutathione-Sepharose, the beads were washed six times with buffer B. SDS-PAGE was performed, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Blots were probed with anti-Cdc42 antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep-anti-mouse antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used for detection. Where indicated, blots were stripped by incubating in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.7% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and re-probed with anti-Rac or anti-Rho antibodies. COS-7 cells were transfected as outlined above and immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as previously described (17Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M.G. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, following preclearing, equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with anti-IQGAP1 or anti-myc antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. Anti-IQGAP1 immune complexes were collected for 2 h with 40 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) and washed five times with buffer B, and Western blotting was carried out as outlined above. Anti-myc immune complexes were collected with 40 μl of Gamma-bind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and processed as described above. Determination of Cdc42 GTPase activity was performed essentially as previously described (15Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of purified MBP-Cdc42 was incubated for 15 min in buffer C (1 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 125 mm NaCl). Cdc42 was loaded with radiolabeled GTP for 15 min in buffer D (0.1 mm [γ-32P]GTP and 30 mmMgCl2). Purified GST-IQGAP1, GST-IQGAP1ΔIQ, or GST-IQGAP1ΔGRD was added to equal amounts of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Cdc42, and GTP hydrolysis was initiated by adding 7.5 mm MgCl2 at 22 °C. As a control, samples without added Mg2+ were processed in parallel. After 15 min, assays were terminated by addition of 4 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm MgCl2. Samples were spotted on Millipore HA 0.45-μm filters, and a vacuum was applied using a Millipore Sampling Manifold Apparatus. Following two washes with ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm MgCl2, the amount of radiolabeled GTP retained on filter membranes was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. GTP hydrolysis was calculated as the difference between the amount of [γ-32P]GTP retained in the absence and presence of Mg2+. In all analyses, wild type and mutant IQGAP1 constructs were processed in parallel in the same assay. HEK-293H cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer E (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were subjected to 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. Crude homogenates were then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S100) fraction was collected, and the pellet fraction (P100) was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer E. MCF-7 cells were trypsinized, plated on Permanox plastic slides in DMEM, allowed to attach overnight, and transiently transfected with myc-tagged wild type IQGAP1 or IQGAP1ΔGRD. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with 400 nm bradykinin for 10 min. Slides were then processed for immunocytochemistry as previously described (24Kim S.H., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were washed once with PBS, followed by fixation in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde for 20 min at 22 °C. Cells were permeabilized in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked for 1 h in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 22 °C. Slides were then incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with rhodamine-phalloidin and an anti-myc antibody followed by FITC-labeled goat-anti-rabbit antibody. After four washes with PBS, slides were mounted with Aqua Polymount (Polysciences, Inc.). Specificity of immunostaining was determined by omission of the primary antibody. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was done with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope and the MRC-1024 Confocal Imaging System (Bio-Rad) as described previously (17Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M.G. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Images were processed using the Lasersharp 3.0 program (Bio-Rad). For live cell imaging, MCF-7 cells were plated on Lab-Tek II chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc Int.) as previously described (24Kim S.H., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with a dual promoter plasmid co-expressing GFP and wild type IQGAP1. Transfection efficiency was usually between 50 and 60%. Cells were imaged at 5-min intervals for 20 min by time-lapse video microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope. Images were collected and processed as described above. For binding, MBP-Cdc42 was loaded with either GDP or GMPPNP as previously described (26Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, MBP-Cdc42 was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 4.4 mm GMPPNP, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, and alkaline phosphatase-agarose for 30 min. MgCl2 was then added to 20 mm. Unbound nucleotide was removed on a Sephadex G-25 centrifuge gel filtration column, equilibrated in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmMgCl2. Nucleotide complexes of MBP-Cdc42 were precleared by incubating with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h. GST, GST-IQGAP1, or GST-IQGAP1ΔGRD was incubated with loaded MBP-Cdc42 in 500 μl of buffer B for 3 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed six times in buffer B, and complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with anti-Cdc42 and anti-IQGAP1 antibodies. Densitometry of ECL signals was analyzed with UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific Corp.). Statistical analysis was assessed by Student's t test, with InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Previous work published by both our laboratory (15Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and other investigators (25Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) documented that IQGAP1 inhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42in vitro, suggesting that IQGAP1 may stabilize Cdc42 in the active (GTP-bound) form. Therefore, the effect of IQGAP1 on levels of active Cdc42 in intact cells was examined by a pull-down assay utilizing a GST-WASP-GBD construct. Because GST-WASP-GBD binds only GTP-bound Cdc42, the amount of bound Cdc42 reflects the amount of active Cdc42 (24Kim S.H., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). HEK-293H cells were transiently transfected with either vector or wild type IQGAP1. Overexpression of IQGAP1 by 2.0- ± 0.05-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 10, p< 0.005) resulted in 1.59- ± 0.02-fold (mean ± S.E.,n = 10, p < 0.005) increase in active Cdc42 (Fig. 1, A andB). The increased IQGAP1 did not change the total amount of Cdc42 in the cell lysate (Fig. 1 A). The positive effect of IQGAP1 on Cdc42 was confirmed in a different system. MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells that stably overexpress IQGAP1 by 3.1- ± 0.25-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3,p < 0.05) were developed. Compared with vector-transfected cells, overexpression of IQGAP1 increased active Cdc42 in MCF-7 cells by 2.1- ± 0.24-fold (mean ± S.E.,n = 3, p < 0.05), without altering total Cdc42 (Fig. 1, A and B). A panel of mutant IQGAP1 constructs was used to ascertain which domain(s) of IQGAP1 is (are) important in mediating the increase in active Cdc42. Analysis was performed with IQGAP1 mutants lacking the WW domain (IQGAP1ΔWW), the IQ domain (IQGAP1ΔIQ), a portion of the GRD (IQGAP1ΔGRD), the C-terminal tail (IQGAP1ΔC), and the entire GRD (IQGAP1ΔGRDF). (Note that Cdc42 co-immunoprecipitates with IQGAP1ΔWW but not with IQGAP1ΔIQ, IQGAP1ΔC, or IQGAP1ΔGRD (21Sokol S.Y., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48425-48430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).) Probing Western blots with anti-myc antibodies (all IQGAP1 constructs have a myc tag) verified that all IQGAP1 constructs were expressed at approximately equal levels (Fig. 1 A). Analogous to wild type IQGAP1 and consistent with co-immunoprecipitation results, IQGAP1ΔWW significantly increased active Cdc42 (by 1.94- ± 0.08-fold, mean ± S.E., n = 10, p< 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). By contrast, neither IQGAP1ΔIQ, IQGAP1ΔC, nor IQGAP1ΔGRDF significantly changed the amount of active Cdc42. Unexpectedly, active Cdc42 was reduced by 0.64- ± 0.01-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 10,p < 0.0005) by expression of IQGAP1ΔGRD (Fig. 1,A and B). The effect of IQGAP1ΔGRD on Cdc42 activity was investigated further. HEK-293H cells were transiently transfected with different amounts of IQGAP1ΔGRD. Where necessary, an appropriate amount of empty vector was added so that the total amount of DNA transfected into all cells was identical. Compared with vector-transfected cells, IQGAP1ΔGRD expression resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of active Cdc42 (Fig.2 A). Co-transfection with equal amounts of IQGAP1 and IQGAP1ΔGRD abrogated the increase in active Cdc42 produced by wild type IQGAP1 (Fig.2 B). These dual transfected cells exhibited an ∼30% decrease in active Cdc42 compared with cells overexpressing IQGAP1 alone. Together these observations indicate that IQGAP1ΔGRD is a dominant negative inhibitor of IQGAP1 activity. Cdc42 is an important regulator of the cytoskeleton (1Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of wild type IQGAP1 and IQGAP1ΔGRD modulated active Cdc42 differentially, we examined the effect of these constructs on the cytoskeleton by confocal microscopy. MCF-7 cells were transfected with either vector, IQGAP1, or IQGAP1ΔGRD. Slides were probed with anti-myc antibody to identify transfected cells and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize F-actin. In MCF-7 cells, transfected wild type IQGAP1 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with accumulation at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 3 A,myc). This location is essentially identical to that of endogenous IQGAP1 in these cells (17Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M.G. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Following transient transfection, wild type IQGAP1-expressing cells exhibited significantly more microspikes than vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A, F-actin, and B). Quantification at 24 h revealed that cells transfected with vector or IQGAP1 had 0.13 ± 0.04 and 10.82 ± 0.43 microspikes per cell (mean ± S.E., n = 100, p < 0.0001), respectively (Fig. 3 B). Live cell imaging was performed to determine whether IQGAP1 induced the formation of true filopodia. A plasmid that co-expresses GFP and wild type IQGAP1 was transiently transfected into MCF-7 cells. Time lapse analysis demonstrated that transfection of IQGAP1 induced the formation of filopodia, which were observed at the 10-, 15-, and 20-min time points (Fig. 3 C). MCF-7 cells transfected with IQGAP1ΔGRD exhibited a morphology markedly different from that seen in cells transfected with wild type IQGAP1. IQGAP1ΔGRD-containing cells were rounded and substantia"

The nucleotide binding domains of these polypeptides are highly conserved, but this similarity has failed to help us understand the biological role of the ATPase activity of the MutL proteins in mismatch repair. hMutLα is a heterodimer of the human MutL homologues hMLH1 and hPMS2, and we decided to exploit its asymmetry to study this function. We now show that although the two subunits contribute differently to the ATPase activity of the heterodimer, hMutLα variants in which one subunit was able to bind but not hydrolyze ATP displayed similarly reduced mismatch repair activities in vitro. In contrast, variants in which either subunit was unable to bind the nucleotide were inactive. Mutation of the catalytic sites of both subunits abolished repair without altering the ability of these peptides to interact with one another. Since the binding of the nucleotide in hMutLα was not required for the formation of ternary complexes with the mismatch recognition factor hMutSα bound to a heteroduplex substrate, we propose that the ATPase activity of hMutLα is required downstream from this process.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 2Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Unlike other DNA repair pathways, correction of biosynthetic errors requires not only that noncanonically paired bases be recognized but also that the repair system be able to differentiate between the template and the newly synthesized DNA strand, such that it can direct the correction process to the latter. In Escherichia coli, mismatched base pairs and short insertion/deletion loops are recognized by the MutS homodimer, which initiates the repair process by recruiting the remaining members of the repairosome: the MutL homodimer, the strand discrimination factor MutH, and DNA helicase II (UvrD) as well as one of several exonucleases (both 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′), DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and DNA ligase. The MutL protein plays a key role in coordinating this process. It activates the cryptic endonuclease activity of MutH (3Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which then nicks the newly synthesized DNA strand. This reaction is enabled by the transient undermethylation of GATC sequences in newly synthesized DNA and by the ability of MutH to incise only the unmethylated strand. MutL also appears to be responsible for directional loading of DNA helicase II at the site of the nick (6Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The displaced DNA is exonucleolytically degraded, and the removed stretch is then resynthesized by the replicative DNA polymerase (for reviews, see Refs. 8Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar and 9Hsieh P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the MMR pathway of E. coli could be reconstituted from the purified individual components (10Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), our knowledge of the molecular mechanism of the process is limited. This is especially true for the MutL protein, the role of which is particularly enigmatic. What is clear is that its transactions, like those of MutS, are governed by ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. This was first implied by experiments of Grilley et al. (11Grilley M. Welsh K.M., Su, S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that MutL and MutS interact on a heteroduplex substrate in an ATP-dependent manner, and from in vivo studies of Aronshtam and Marinus (12Aronshtam A. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), who showed that MutL alleles carrying single amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the ATP binding domain of MutL were unable to complement the MMR defect of amutL− strain. More recently, the N-terminal domain of MutL could be shown to contain four short sequence motifs that are found also in the type II topoisomerases, the HSP90 heat shock proteins and histidine kinases (Fig. 1a) (13Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 14Mushegian A.R. Bassett D.E., Jr. Boguski M.S. Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5831-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of members of all four families revealed that these proteins share a novel nucleotide-binding fold and suggested an important role for the invariant residues in binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP (for a review, see Ref. 15Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Thus, this superfamily of proteins, known as GHKL ATPases, is likely to have evolved from a common ancestor. However, as illustrated by the divergent roles of these proteins, their common fold is a poor predictor of biological function.The recently described crystal structures of LN40, the N-terminal 349 amino acid residues of MutL (16Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), revealed that the polypeptide folds into two α/β domains (Fig. 1a). The first (amino acids 20–200) harbors all four conserved motifs that form the nucleotide binding site. In the second domain (amino acids 224–331), a loop containing an invariant lysine residue (Lys-307), is likely to act as a sensor that triggers a conformational change in the protein in response to nucleotide binding within the first domain. Such changes have been noted with both LN40 and the entire MutL protein (16Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Analysis of gel filtration and sedimentation properties of the full-length MutL suggested that its elongated structure became globular upon binding of ADPPNP. More dramatically, binding of ADPPNP triggered dimerization of LN40 in solution as well as in crystallization experiments. The structure of LN40·ADPPNP revealed that more than 60 amino acid residues within this domain became ordered and contributed to nucleotide binding or to the dimerization of the NBDs. Assuming that the carboxyl-terminal ends of MutL remain stably associated during this time, the amino-terminal part of MutL could function as an ATP-driven molecular gate. Type II topoisomerases make use of such a gate to capture a segment of duplex DNA in order to pass it through a transient double strand break (18Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and ATP-induced dimerization of HSP90 (19Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) has been suggested to play a role in clamping the substrate polypeptides during the folding reaction (20Young J.C. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, ATP binding/hydrolysis is important in the coordination of HSP90 interactions with other proteins. For example, HSP90 interacts with the co-chaperone p23 only in its ATP-bound form (21Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Given that MutL needs to interact with different partners, a similar role of ATP binding might be anticipated. Based on the observation that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues promoted the binding of single-stranded DNA by MutL (17Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 23Mechanic L.E. Frankel B.A. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38337-38346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the molecular gate might be used to clamp MutL onto DNA. In agreement with this, single-stranded DNA was found to stimulate the very weak ATPase activity of MutL (17Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 24Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Importantly, substitution of an arginine residue located within the gate (R266E) abolished both DNA binding and the stimulation of the ATPase activity (17Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism of MMR appears to be highly conserved, as witnessed by the identification of MutS and MutL (but not MutH) homologues in most organisms studied to date. In human cells, the MutS homologues hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6 form two heterodimers, hMutSα (hMSH2/hMSH6) and hMutSβ (hMSH2/hMSH3), which are involved in mismatch recognition (25Drummond J.T., Li, G.M.

Of the nearly 300 families entered in the HNPCC data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.nfdht.nl), more than 160 carry mutations in the hMLH1locus, of which about 30% cause single amino acid changes. Many of these missense mutations are found in the highly conserved amino-terminal region, suggesting that they might affect the ATPase function of the hMLH1 protein (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, no corresponding mutations have been identified in the hPMS2gene, with only four families with germ line mutations in this locus having been described to date (33Nicolaides N.C.

This implies either that the hPMS2 gene is less prone to mutagenesis than the other HNPCC loci, that the function of hPMS2 is not essential for MMR due to a possible functional redundancy with another member of the MutL homologue family, such as for example hMLH3 (42Lipkin S.M.

We set out to address the latter hypothesis by studying the relative importance of the ATP binding domains of the two subunits of hMutLα in the MMR process. We could show previously that recombinant hMutLα, purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells, was able to complement in vitro the MMR defect of human cell lines carrying mutations in either the hMLH1 or hPMS2genes (37Räschle M.

After washing the cells with 10 pellet volumes of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm PMSF, the cells were resuspended in 3 pellet volumes of cold buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 2× CompleteEDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation (20 min, 4 °C), the cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer (15 strokes). 2 pellet volumes of a cold 50% glycerol solution and NaCl (to a final concentration of 300 mm) were added. After incubation (30 min, 4 °C, mixing), extracts were centrifuged (36,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C in a Sorvall TH-641 rotor) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C.Purification of the hMutLα VariantsExtracts from infected Sf9 cells were diluted with an equal volume of buffer H (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm β-ME) and centrifuged (36,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C in a Sorvall TH-641 rotor). Filtered extracts (0.45 μm) were applied to a 5-ml heparin HiTrap column (AP Biotech) equilibrated with buffer H containing 150 mm NaCl, and proteins were eluted with a rising 2%/ml salt gradient. Pooled fractions containing the hMutLα variants were adjusted to 5 mm imidazol. An appropriate volume of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Stratagene) (∼7 ml of a 50% slurry per 100 mg of extracts from Sf9 cells expressing wild-type hMutLα) was added. After incubation on an end-over-end shaker for 60 min at 4 °C, extracts were transferred into dispensable plastic columns (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed five times with 5 column volumes of cold buffer WB (300 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm PMSF) containing 10 mm imidazol. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer WB containing 100 mm imidazol and with 5 column volumes of buffer WB containing 200 mm imidazol. Fractions containing the highly purified MutLα variants were pooled, adjusted to 150 mm NaCl, and concentrated on a 1-ml Resource-Q (AP Biotech) column. Prior to the injection into the Resource-Q column, proteins were passed through a 6-ml Resource-S column to remove possible contaminants. After injection, the Resource-S column was removed, and proteins were eluted with a rising 4%/ml salt gradient. The fractions containing the pure proteins were pooled, dialyzed extensively against storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 110 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C.Other ProteinsThe purified hMutSα was described previously (43Iaccarino I.

The samples were placed on ice, irradiated for 5 min in an UV-Stratalinker (Stratagene), and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were extensively washed in fixing solution (30% methanol, 10% acetic acid) and analyzed by autoradiography.Partial Proteolysis ExperimentsIn a final volume of 20 μl, 3 μg (16.5 pmol) of the recombinant proteins were incubated with 25 mmTris-Cl (pH 8), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT in the presence or absence of 1 mm MgCl2. The ATP concentration was between 0 and 10 mm, as shown in Fig. 6. After a 15-min preincubation at 20 °C, 10 ng of trypsin (Promega) were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 8 min at 20 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 6× SDS loading dye and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue.FIG. 6ATP and magnesium binding induce a conformational change in the hMLH1 subunit.a, 3 μg of purified wild type hMutLα were incubated with increasing concentrations of ATP and 1 mm Mg2+ for 15 min at 20 °C. The proteins were then partially digested with 10 ng of trypsin for further 8 min at 20 °C, and the tryptic peptides were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie Blue. The proteolytic fragment appearing in the presence of >10 μm ATP is marked with an arrow. b, the appearance of the 39-kDa proteolytic fragment (arrow) is dependent on the presence of ATP and magnesium. The fragment was absent from the partial tryptic digest of LαNA/WT, which is unable to bind ATP in the active site of the hMLH1 subunit. This suggests that the fragment originates from the latter polypeptide (see “Results” for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ATPase AssaysThe ATPase assays were carried out at 37 °C in a 15-μl reaction mix containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 400 μm cold ATP, 222 nm[γ-32P]ATP, and 60 pmol of purified protein (4 μm). To test the DNA-dependent stimulation of the hMutLα heterodimer, either an 81-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide (81BG-GTGT–; final concentration 12 μm) or a 3193-nucleotide-long single-stranded and covalently closed phagemid DNA (pGEM-T; final concentration 2, 20, or 200 nm) were added to the reactions (data not shown). At selected time points, 2-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 5 μl of formamide-loading dye. 2-μl aliquots were loaded onto 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, which were then exposed to Biomax MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The bands were quantified using ImageQuant Software version 1.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For the calculation of the Michaelis-Menten constants, the ATPase activity was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of cold ATP (200–1000 μm).In Vitro MMR AssaysThe MMR assays were carried out as described previously (45Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared from TK6 and HCT116 cell lines, using 5 × 108 cells harvested in the exponential growth phase. After resuspension in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT) at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml, the cells were allowed to swell for 10 min in a glass Dounce homogenizer on ice and then lysed mechanically by applying four or more strokes with a tight pestle. When more than 80% of cells were lysed, the nuclei were pelleted, and the supernatant was centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and stored in"
https://openalex.org/W2158074043,"Two PDZ domain-containing proteins, NHERF and E3KARP are necessary for cAMP-dependent inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3). In this study, we demonstrate a specific role of E3KARP, which is not duplicated by NHERF, in Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity. NHE3 activity is inhibited by elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+] i ) in PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing E3KARP but not those expressing NHERF. In addition, this Ca2+-dependent inhibition requires Ca2+-dependent association between α-actinin-4 and E3KARP. NHE3 is indirectly connected to α-actinin-4 in a protein complex through Ca2+-dependent interaction between α-actinin-4 and E3KARP, which occurs through the actin-binding domain plus spectrin repeat domain of α-actinin-4. Elevation of [Ca2+] i results in oligomerization and endocytosis of NHE3 as well as in inhibition of NHE3 activity. Overexpression of α-actinin-4 potentiates the inhibitory effect of ionomycin on NHE3 activity by accelerating the oligomerization and endocytosis of NHE3. In contrast, overexpression of the actin-binding domain plus spectrin repeat domain acts as a dominant-negative mutant and prevents the inhibitory effect of ionomycin on NHE3 activity as well as the oligomerization and internalization of NHE3. From these results, we propose that elevated Ca2+ inhibits NHE3 activity through oligomerization and endocytosis of NHE3, which occurs via formation of an NHE3-E3KARP-α-actinin-4 complex.

However, the effect of elevation of [Ca2+] i in cell culture models differs among cell lines. In human colon cancer Caco-2 epithelial cells (C2bbe) stably transfected with NHE3, elevation of [Ca2+] i by treatment with thapsigargin inhibited NHE3 activity (8McSwine R.L. Musch M.W. Bookstein C. Xie Y. Rao M. Chang E.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C693-C701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

These results therefore suggest that a regulatory factor, which is specifically expressed in ileum and Caco-2 (C2bbe) epithelial cells but not in PS120 fibroblasts, might be required for the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity. To understand the mechanism of this inhibition, the molecular identity of the regulatory factors involved in the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity needed to be elucidated.

In addition, the last 30 amino acids of these PDZ domain proteins interact with ezrin. Ezrin is thought to act as an A kinase-anchoring protein, which physically places PKA near NHE3 (14Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,15Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Either of these PDZ domain proteins is necessary for cAMP-induced inhibition of NHE3 activity by allowing PKA-dependent phosphorylation of NHE3 (16Zizak M. Lamprecht G. Steplock D. Tariq N.

Another mechanism for acute regulation of NHE3 activity includes membrane trafficking between an intracellular recycling compartment and the plasma membrane (17Chow C.W. Khurana S. Woodside M.

NHE3 is active on the plasma membrane, and the alteration of surface NHE3 protein abundance plays a role in regulation of NHE3 activity by extracellular agonists including peptide hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters (1Donowitz M. Khurana S. Tse C.M. Yun C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G971-G977PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown whether NHERF or E3KARP is involved in regulation of NHE3 trafficking. Whether either NHERF or E3KARP is involved in the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity is also unknown. α-Actinin is a class of actin-binding protein that cross-links F-actin bundles or networks and also connects F-actin to the plasma membrane. So far, four isoforms (α-actinin-1–4) of human α-actinin have been identified. These are classified into (i) muscle type (α-actinin-2 and -3) and (ii) non-muscle type (α-actinin-1 and -4). α-Actinin exists as an antiparallel homodimer with a globular actin-binding domain, four spectrin-like repeats, and two EF-hands motifs (20Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Dimerization of α-actinin is mediated by its spectrin-like repeats (21Flood G. Kahana E. Gilmore A.P. Rowe A.J. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The C-terminal EF-hands domains differ among the α-actinin classes. Muscle isoforms contain non-functional EF-hand motifs, which do not bind Ca2+ at physiological concentrations, and thereby bind to actin filaments in a Ca2+-insensitive manner (20Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, non-muscle isoforms contain two functional EF-hand motifs, and Ca2+binding to these EF-hand motifs reduces the affinity of α-actinin for F-actin (22Tang J. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). α-Actinin-4 (ACTN4) originally was identified as a protein that is up-regulated upon enhanced cell movement and is related to cancer invasion (23Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). ACTN4 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (24Vallenius T. Luukko K. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11100-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); however, no studies have implicated ACTN4 in the regulation of intestinal Na+ absorption. In this study, we demonstrate that E3KARP is specifically involved in the inhibition of NHE3 activity by elevation of [Ca2+] i through an interaction with ACTN4. Elevation of [Ca2+] i induces NHE3 oligomerization and endocytosis of NHE3 with formation of a protein complex containing NHE3, E3KARP, and ACTN4. The oligomerization and endocytosis of NHE3 require a Ca2+-dependent association between E3KARP and ACTN4. This is the first study to show that E3KARP plays a unique role in regulation of NHE3 activity, which is not duplicated by NHERF. Mouse monoclonal (9E10) antibody against Myc epitopes was from Babco Inc. (Berkeley, CA), and monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody P5D4 (hybridoma culture medium) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Louvard (Curie Institute, Paris, France). The rabbit polyclonal anti-ACTN4 antibody, which has been reported to specifically recognize ACTN4 but not α-actinin-1 (23Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and the cDNA for ACTN4 were kindly provided by Dr. S. Hirohashi (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen. Tetramethylammonium was from Fluka Chemical Corp. (Milwaukee, WI). Ionomycin and thapsigargin were from Sigma. Various domains of ACTN4 were generated by a PCR-based strategy from the ACTN4 cDNA. These domains include ABD (corresponding to amino acids 1–237), ABDR12 (aa 1–490), R14 (aa 269–724), R14EF (aa 269–811), R34EF (aa 504–811), and EF (aa 742–811). The PCR products were shuttled into pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoRI and XhoI sites introduced during PCR. NHERF and E3KARP were subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector by the PCR-based strategy, and the various domains of E3KARP, including PDZ1 (aa 12–92), PDZ2 (aa 155–231), C (aa 231–327), and C-terminally extended second PDZ domain (aa 155–327) were also generated by PCR and shuttled into the pGEX4T-1 vector. These were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins in BL-21 cells (Stratagene), and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose as suggested by the manufacturer. The plasmids bearing Myc-tagged ACTN4 or ABDR14 (aa 1–724) were generated by subcloning the EcoRI-XhoI fragments produced by PCR into pcDNA4/myc-His (Invitrogen, CA). The fidelity of the PCR products was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. PS120/NHE3V fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 400 μg/ml G418, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2, 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP and PS120/NHE3V/NHERF cells were established (12Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and cultured in medium supplemented with 600 μg/ml hygromycin to maintain the selection pressure. PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP cells were transfected with cDNAs for full-length human ACTN4 or ABDR14 using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). To select cells stably transfected with the cDNAs, 800 μg/ml Zeocin, 400 μg/ml G418, and 600 μg/ml hygromycin were added to the medium, and cells resistant to the selection pressure were selected through eight passages prior to study. PS120 cells were plated on glass coverslips and grown until they reached 50–70% confluency. They were then placed in serum-free media for ∼4 h before transport was studied as described previously (10Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were incubated in Na+ solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester (BCECF-AM, 5 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 40 mm NH4Cl for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were initially perfused with TMA+ solution (130 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), which was then switched to Na+ solution. Na+/H+ exchange rate data were calculated as the product of Na+-dependent change in pH i times the buffering capacity at each pH i and were analyzed by a nonlinear regression data analysis program (Origin software), which allowed fitting of data to a general allosteric model described by the Hill equation, (v =V max[S] n /(K′[H+] i +[S] n ), with estimates for V max andK′[H+] i and their respective errors (S.E.), as well as fitting to a hyperbolic curve, such as would be expected with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The S.E. was calculated by computer to reflect variability of the parameters estimated. Rabbit ileal villus cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin); unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The pellets were treated with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize membrane-associated proteins and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 40 min to remove insoluble pellets. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were reacted with aliquots (5 mg) of the ileal membrane extracts and washed three times with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to SDS-electrophoresis. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the candidate band was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin as described (25Jensen O.N. Vorm O. Mann M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The masses of the tryptic peptides were measured with a Voyager DE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization was performed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Comparison of the mass values against the Swiss-Prot data base was performed using Peptide Search (26Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using lysates from PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP cells treated with ionomycin or vehicle. In some experiments, PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP cells stably transfected with ACTN4 or ABDR14 were used for immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Aliquots (1 mg of protein) of lysates were reacted with either anti-E3KARP or anti-ACTN4 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were separated by binding to protein A-Sepharose resin and were washed three times with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. The amounts of NHE3, ACTN4, and E3KARP in immune complexes were detected by Western blot analysis. To measure surface NHE3, PS120 cells were treated with either agonist or vehicle at room temperature under the same condition used for measurement of NHE3 activity and then surface-labeled with biotin as described previously (27Akhter S. Cavet M.E. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mmNaCl and 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), cells were incubated with NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) in borate buffer (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm boric acid, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9) and exposed to the quenching buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of N+ buffer (60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mmNa3EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100), and the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble cellular debris. Protein content in the supernatant was quantified by the method of Bradford, and equal amounts of cell lysate were incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) at 4 °C. The remaining supernatant was retained as the intracellular fraction. The streptavidin-agarose beads were washed repeatedly in N+buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were solubilized in Laemmli's buffer. The total, intracellular, and surface fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to NC membrane, and NHE3 antigen was quantified by labeling with anti-VSV-G antibody. The efficiency of cell surface biotinylation of NHE3 is estimated to be at least 85% (28Cavet M.E. Akhter S. Murtazina R. Sanchez de Medina F. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C2039-C2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PS120 fibroblasts were plated on glass coverslips 24 h prior to experiments. After 18 h, monolayers were washed with serum-free medium and cultured for 4 h in serum-free medium. Cells were treated with ionomycin or vehicles for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. The fixed cells were washed with PBS buffer, permeabilized for 10 min with PBS buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and placed in blocking solution (PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution at the following dilutions: 1:500 for polyclonal antibody Ab2570 (anti-E3KARP antibody) and 1:200 for polyclonal anti-ACTN4 antibody. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and then examined with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal fluorescence microscope. NHE3 and its regulatory proteins, NHERF and E3KARP, localize in BB membrane of ileum (29Li X. Galli T. Leu S. Wade J.B. Weinmann E.J. Leung G. Cheong A. Louvard D. Donowitz M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 537-552Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Elevation of [Ca2+] i induced by treatment with carbachol or ionomycin equivalently inhibit BB Na+/H+exchanger activity in intact ileum (4Cohen M.E. Wesolek J. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We reported that either NHERF or E3KARP was necessary for cAMP-induced inhibition of NHE3 activity in PS120 fibroblasts. To determine whether NHERF or E3KARP was involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of NHE3, we examined the effect of ionomycin in PS120 cells stably expressing either NHERF or E3KARP. As shown in Fig.1 A, in PS120 cells stably expressing NHE3 (PS120/NHE3V), NHE3 activity was not affected by treatment with 2 μm ionomycin, consistent with a previous report (9Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Noel J. Schmitt B. Orlowski J. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26460-26465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ionomycin treatment of PS120/NHE3V cells overexpressing NHERF (PS120/NHE3V/NHERF) also did not alter NHE3 activity (Fig.1 B). In contrast, in E3KARP-overexpressing PS120 cells (PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP), ionomycin treatment (15 min at room temperature) caused a 35% decrease in V max estimates (3932 ± 219 μm/s for control versus2557 ± 621 μm/s for ionomycin-treated cells,p < 0.01) (Fig. 1 C). The inhibitory effect of ionomycin on NHE3 activity was completely prevented by co-treatment with EGTA to chelate extracellular free calcium. However, ionomycin also is a protonophore that could affect intracellular pH. To support that elevating [Ca2+] i inhibits NHE3 activity, we determined the effect of thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor. Treatment with 10 nmthapsigargin also inhibits NHE3 activity to a similar extent as ionomycin in PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP cells (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, these results suggest that E3KARP but not NHERF is necessary for inhibition of NHE3 activity induced by elevation of [Ca2+] i . Both NHERF and E3KARP are involved in the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 through ezrin-mediated formation of a protein complex that includes PKA II and NHE3 (12Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that E3KARP but not NHERF is specifically involved in the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 (Fig. 1). These findings suggest a model in which a protein factor, which specifically interacts with E3KARP but not with NHERF, may be required for the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 in PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP cells. To identify E3KARP-binding proteins that do not interact with NHERF, we incubated membrane extract derived from rabbit ileal villus cells with immobilized GST-E3KARP, GST-NHERF, and GST as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2 A, we found that a 100-kDa protein specifically binds to immobilized GST-E3KARP but not to GST nor GST-NHERF. In contrast, NHERF interacts with two distinct proteins with molecular masses of 140- and 95-kDa, supporting the specific interaction of E3KARP with the 100-kDa protein. The 100-kDa protein band was excised and “in-gel”-digested with trypsin. The resultant peptides were eluted and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Fig. 2 B). The masses, designated as P1–P11, were compared with proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base. As shown in Fig.2 C, 11 masses matched the calculated masses of tryptic peptides of ACTN4 with an accuracy of >100 ppm, and the peptides covered 15% of the sequence of ACTN4. In contrast, the 95- and 140-kDa protein bands, which bound to immobilized GST-NHERF, were identified as β-COP and α-COP of the coatomer protein complex, respectively, by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis (data not shown). These results suggest that ACTN4 is an E3KARP-specific binding protein expressed in ileum. In ileum, both NHE3 and E3KARP are primarily localized in the BB membrane of ileum (29Li X. Galli T. Leu S. Wade J.B. Weinmann E.J. Leung G. Cheong A. Louvard D. Donowitz M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 537-552Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To clarify whether ACTN4 also localizes in the ileal BB membrane, we investigated the localization of ACTN4 in ileum by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 2 D, ACTN4 is mostly localized in BB, even though it also exists in basolateral membrane. E3KARP shows a similar pattern of localization with ACTN4 in BB membrane (Fig. 2 D). Immunogold staining using electron microscopy showed that most of ACTN4 localizes in the area of the terminal web, but there is also a significant portion of ACTN4 in BB (Fig. 2 E). These results indicate that ACTN4 is in the same location of ileal Na+-absorbing cells as NHE3 and E3KARP. E3KARP contains two PDZ domains, and NHE3 binds to the P2C domain of E3KARP (15Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To elucidate which domain of E3KARP is involved in the interaction with ACTN4, membrane extracts of ileal villus cells were reacted with each separate domain of E3KARP (PDZ1 and PDZ2, C terminus; and C-terminally extended second PDZ domain) fused to GST. The GST fusion proteins were constructed by PCR and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblot analysis using anti-ACTN4 antibody shows that ACTN4 specifically binds to immobilized GST-E3KARP but binds neither GST-NHERF nor GST alone (Fig.3 A), consistent with the result shown in Fig. 2 A. ACTN4 binds to the P2C fragment of E3KARP, which is the same region required for the interaction with NHE3, whereas it does not interact with PDZ1, PDZ2, and C-terminal regions of E3KARP, indicating the specificity of the association between ACTN4 and the P2C region of E3KARP. E3KARP but not NHERF is involved in the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity (Fig. 1), and E3KARP specifically binds with ACTN4 (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). ACTN4 contains two EF-hand domains that are involved in Ca2+ binding (20Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 22Tang J. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of Ca2+ on the direct interaction between GST-ACTN4 and E3KARP. His6-tagged E3KARP was expressed in E. coli and homogeneously purified by using Ni+-NTA affinity column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3 B, in the absence of free Ca2+, E3KARP binds minimally to immobilized GST-ACTN4. In contrast, in the presence of Ca2+, E3KARP binds to immobilized GST-ACTN4, and the amount of bound E3KARP is increased in a Ca2+concentration-dependent manner. The binding of ACTN4 with E3KARP reaches near maximum at 1 μm[Ca2+] i . This suggests that the interaction between ACTN4 and E3KARP may be regulated by physiological elevation of [Ca2+] i . ACTN4 contains an actin-binding domain, four spectrin-like repeats, and two EF-hand domains (20Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To clarify which domain of ACTN4 is involved in the interaction with E3KARP, we generated multiple fragments of ACTN4 as GST fusion proteins described in Fig. 3 C. The fragments were expressed in E. coli and immobilized to GSH-agarose (Fig. 3 D). The immobilized GST-fused fragments of ACTN4 were incubated with His6-tagged E3KARP in the absence or presence of 1 μm[Ca2+] i . E3KARP binds to the actin-binding domain (ABD) of ACTN4, and the binding of E3KARP to immobilized GST-ABD is increased by addition of two spectrin-like repeats (ABDR12) (Fig.3 E). However, spectrin-repeat domains (R14) themselves do not interact with E3KARP, suggesting that the actin-binding domain is mainly involved in the interaction of ACTN4 with E3KARP. The GST fusion proteins containing EF-hand motifs, i.e. R14EF, R34EF, and EF, associate with E3KARP in the presence of Ca2+, but much lower amounts of E3KARP bind to the EF-hand domains containing fusion proteins compared with ABD and ABDR12. From these results, we suggest that the interaction between E3KARP and ACTN4 is primarily mediated by the ABD domain of ACTN4, and this interaction is Ca2+-dependent. In this study, we showed that E3KARP interacts with ACTN4 in a Ca2+-dependent mannerin vitro (Fig. 3 B). This result raised the question whether E3KARP a"

However, several lines of evidence have suggested that Daxx is located mainly in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional regulator. Recent studies have further indicated that Daxx-elicited transcriptional repression can be inhibited by the nuclear body-associated promyelocytic leukemia protein and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 by sequestering Daxx to the nuclear bodies and the cytoplasm, respectively. Here, we further investigated the coordinated molecular mechanism by which Daxx function is regulated through protein-protein interaction. Using yeast two-hybrid screens to identify Daxx-interacting protein(s), three independent clones encoding the 58-kDa microspherule protein (MSP58) fragments were identified. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Daxx interacts in vitro and in vivo with MSP58 via its NH2-terminal segment, which is distinct from the binding region of Fas, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and promyelocytic leukemia protein, suggesting a unique modulatory role of MSP58 on Daxx function. Transient transfection experiments revealed that MSP58 relieves the repressor activity of Daxx in a dose-dependent manner in COS-1 and 293 cells but not in HeLa cells, implicating cell type-specific modulation of Daxx function by MSP58. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis unequivocally demonstrated that MSP58 overexpression results in a translocation of Daxx to the enlarged nucleoli in COS-1 or 293 cells, whereas Daxx exhibited a diffuse nuclear pattern in HeLa cells. Taken together, these findings delineate a network of regulatory signaling pathways that converges on MSP58/Daxx interaction, causally associating Daxx nucleolus targeting with its transcriptional activation function.

Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis unequivocally demonstrated that MSP58 overexpression results in a translocation of Daxx to the enlarged nucleoli in COS-1 or 293 cells, whereas Daxx exhibited a diffuse nuclear pattern in HeLa cells. Taken together, these findings delineate a network of regulatory signaling pathways that converges on MSP58/Daxx interaction, causally associating Daxx nucleolus targeting with its transcriptional activation function. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 small ubiquitin-like modifier promyelocytic leukemia protein E26 avian leukemia oncogene 1 mammalian STE20-like kinase 3 DNA-binding domain 58-kDa microspherule protein glutathioneS-transferase hemagglutinin glucocorticoid receptor dexamethasone PML oncogenic domains paired amphipathic helices Daxx was initially identified in yeast two-hybrid screens as a protein associated with the death domain of the Fas receptor and was thought to be involved in promoting Fas-induced apoptosis (1Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Daxx, notably in cooperation with Fas overexpression, resulted in an enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis and the activation of Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1 pathway (1Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated that the COOH-terminal portion of Daxx is involved in its interaction with Fas receptor (1Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of the Daxx COOH-terminal domain inhibited both Fas-induced JNK activation and Fas-induced apoptosis (1Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of Daxx in the apoptosis process, Chang et al. (2Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) has reported that Daxx-induced JNK pathway activation appears through a direct protein-protein interaction and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) kinase activation. The overexpression of a kinase-deficient ASK1 was shown to inhibit Fas- and Daxx-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggested that Daxx functions as an adaptor protein linking Fas signaling to JNK pathway via ASK1. Furthermore, upon stimulation of the death receptor Fas, Daxx translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and triggers caspase-independent cell death by association with ASK1 (2Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 3Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recently, two reports (4Charette S.J. Lambert H. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36071-36074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Ko Y.G. Kang Y.S. Park H. Seol W. Kim J. Kim T. Park H.S. Choi E.J. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39103-39106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ASK1 activation is required for Daxx to mediate Fas-induced signaling and localize in the cytoplasm. In addition, heat shock protein 27 has been reported to interact with Daxx to prevent Fas-induced Daxx translocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to the inhibition of Fas- induced Daxx- and ASK1-dependent apoptosis (3Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Hence, these observations have suggested a role for Daxx in a Fas-mediated signal transduction pathway and as a pro-apoptotic signal mediator in the cytoplasm. Moreover, Daxx has also been reported to be associated directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the type II tumor growth factor-β receptor, mediating tumor growth factor-β-induced apoptosis and JNK activation (6Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this respect, Daxx is postulated to function in the cytoplasm as a signal transducer between the cell-surface receptor and the ASK1/JNK kinase cascade. However, several lines of evidence also indicate that Daxx may play a direct role in the nuclear events to modulate gene expression. In particular, several groups (1Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 2Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 7Chang H.Y. Yang X. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have reported that Daxx is present exclusively in the nucleus, a result that appeared inconsistent with the findings that Daxx is part of a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex of Fas, ASK1, and Daxx upon Fas stimulation. Furthermore, it has been reported that Daxx interacts with SUMO-modified PML, which serves as a component of nuclear domain 10, also referred to as the PML bodies or PML oncogenic domains (PODs) (8Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 9Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss III, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 10Li H. Leo C. Zhu J., Wu, X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The results from these studies led to a hypothesis that the Daxx enhancement of Fas-induced apoptosis, at least in part, is a consequence of PML-mediated association of Daxx with PODs in the nucleus (8Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that the interaction between PML and Daxx constitutes a novel nuclear pathway to elicit apoptotic response (11Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Additional supports for a nuclear function of Daxx came from reports on the identification of its nuclear interacting proteins as well as its intriguing property to repress basal and activated transcription (8Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Daxx can inhibit the activity of the transcriptional activator ETS1, leading to the down-regulation expression of two ETS1 target genes,MMP1 and Bcl-2 (13Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, Daxx has been shown to interact with DNA methyltransferase 1, implicating its role in gene silencing (14Michaelson J.S. Bader D. Kuo F. Kozak C. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for the Daxx-mediated repression remains to be unraveled, but its interaction with the histone deacetylase 1 implies that histone deacetylation is potentially involved in thetrans-repression events (10Li H. Leo C. Zhu J., Wu, X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Several studies revealed that effective sumoylation of PML and subsequent recruitment to PODs modulate transcriptional activity of Daxx. Upon sumoylation of PML, the Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression is attenuated, whereas such a derepression correlates well with the sequestration of Daxx to the PODs (10Li H. Leo C. Zhu J., Wu, X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, Lehembre et al. (15Lehembre F. Muller S. Pandolfi P.P. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SUMO-1-modified PML can derepress Pax3 transcriptional activity through the sequestration of Daxx into the PODs. Taken together, these observations suggest that Daxx functions as a transcriptional repressor whose repressive effect can be modulated by PML through the subnuclear compartmentalization. Protein shuttling within the individual cell may play an important regulatory role for protein functions. Accumulated evidence has suggested that Daxx can be shuttled within subnuclear compartments. For example, sumoylated PML is able to interact with Daxx, leading to the recruitment of Daxx to the compartment of PODs. Furthermore, Daxx was found to interact with the centromere protein C (CENP-C), implicating an interphase-restricted association of Daxx with centromeres (16Pluta A.F. Earnshaw W.C. Goldberg I.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results from immunofluorescence studies have revealed that there is a dynamic and cell cycle-regulated shuttling of Daxx between centromeres and PODs (16Pluta A.F. Earnshaw W.C. Goldberg I.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Pluta A.F. Sternsdorf T. Ainsztein A.M. Carmena M. Ruchaud S. Hsu W.L. Orr A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3443-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the translocation of Daxx to PODs is also involved in interferon-triggered apoptosis (18Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang Z. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that intracellular protein localization is tightly regulated in cells. Although the functional significance of these observations remains to be established, it is highly likely that a regulatory process governing protein trafficking exists in response to a variety of physiological and pathological alterations in many different cell types. To explore the nuclear factor(s) that modulates Daxx function, we have searched the Daxx-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid library screen. In this study, we have characterized both biochemical and functional interactions between Daxx and MSP58, a nucleolar protein that has been identified as a p120-interacting protein (19Ren Y. Busch R.K. Perlaky L. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The overexpression of MSP58 relieves the transcriptional repression mediated by Daxx. Furthermore, we show that the Daxx-mediated repression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcriptional activity can be inhibited by MSP58. Intriguingly, such a derepression correlates well with the sequestration of Daxx to the nucleolus, which is mediated through its interaction with the MSP58. The mechanism for regulating Daxx function is comparable with PML sequestration of Daxx to the PODs. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory role for the nucleolus structure and nucleolar protein, MSP58, in modulating Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression. The DNA fragments encoding the full-length or a portion of human Daxx were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subsequently inserted into the pBTM116 vector to produce baits for yeast two-hybrid studies. The LexA-Daxx construct was used to screen against with human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH). Yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as described previously (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). L40 yeast strain was first transformed with pLexA-Daxx and followed by 250 μg of the testis cDNA library transformation. The library transformants were selected on medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. His+ colonies were further tested for β-galactosidase activity using a colony lift filter assay. The plasmids from both His+ and X-gal+ colonies were isolated by the curing process of MC1066 bacterial strain and retransformed with LexA-Daxx, LexA-MST3, or LexA-lamin to test the binding specificity. The library plasmids conferred that the Daxx-specific interactions were then subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Quantitative X-gal assays were performed with yeasts containing pairs of bait and prey plasmids as indicated. The X-gal activities were determined from three separate liquid yeast cultures according to the instructions of the Galacto-light Plus kit (Tropix Inc, Bedford, MA). A PCR fragment encoding full-length (amino acids 1–740) of human Daxx was subcloned into vector pBTM116 in-frame with LexA to generate the LexA-Daxx bait. PML and MST3 were also fused in-frame with LexA in pBTM116. A series of Daxx deletion fragments were inserted into pBTM116 and pcDNA3-HA vectors for fusion protein expression in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. To obtain pACT2-MSP58, pCMV-FLAG-MSP58, and pGST-MSP58, the MSP58 full-length cDNA was generated by PCR amplification from human testis cDNA library and inserted into the vector pACT2, pCMV-tag2 (Stratagene), or pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. pG5-luciferase with five Gal4 binding sites in front of the minimal promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene is from Stratagene. An SV40-driven β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, pSV-βGAL, was used in this study as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Gal-DBD fusions containing full-length Daxx and Daxx fragments were generated by PCR and cloned into the BamH1 site of pCMX-Gal-DBD plasmid. Mammalian vectors expressing PML and GR were gifts from Dr. Ronald M. Evans and Dr. David Ann, respectively. The mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-luciferase reporter construct was generously provided by Dr. Chawnshang Chang. The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (21Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Various35S-labeled Daxx proteins were made with in vitro transcription and translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 35S-Labeled proteins were incubated with 2 μg of each GST-MSP58 fusion protein in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) for 1–2 h, washed four times, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A fraction of the reaction mixture was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining to visualize GST fusion proteins. For testing the association in mammalian cells, various HA-Daxx and FLAG-MSP58 constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells 70% confluent in a 10-cm dish. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Whole cell lysates were mixed with antiserum against HA (BABCO, Richmond, CA) or against FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), and the immunocomplexes were mixed with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After 2 h of incubation, the immunocomplexes were then gently washed three times with the same buffer as described above followed by Western blot analysis with the anti-HA antibody or with the anti-FLAG antibody. Proteins were detected using the ECL kits (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Gal4-DBD antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monkey COS-1, HeLa, and 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-Daxx, pCMX-PML, or pCMV-FLAG-MSP58 by the lipofection method. Forty-eight hour after transfection, the cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-PML monoclonal antibody (PG-M3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-HA polyclone (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) for FLAG and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) for recognized Daxx polyclone (M-112, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min, respectively. The nuclei were revealed by 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (10 μg/ml). The coverslips were inverted, mounted on slides, and sealed with nail polish. Pictures were taken using fluorescent microscopy. All mammalian cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). COS-1 and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were seeded into 10-cm plates the day before transfection. Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE transfection kit (Invitrogen). Cell extracts were harvested 36 h later for co-immunoprecipitation assays and Western blot analysis. For the reporter gene assay, 2–3 ×105cells were seeded on 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfections, and 4 h before transfection, the cells received fresh medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 2 μg of total plasmid DNA/well were used in the transfection. The total amount of plasmid per well was kept constant by adding pcDNA3 empty vector. Cells were harvested 36 h later, and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity (Packard, Meriden, CT). For the experiments of GR activation, cells were induced with dexamethasone (Dex) 18 h after the start of transfection and then harvested after an additional 24 h. Luminescence was measured on a top counter microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Packard 9912V) in single photon counting mode for 0.1 min/well following a 10-min adaptation in the dark. Luciferase values were normalized by the internal control β-galactosidase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Experimental results are presented as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. To identify Daxx-interacting proteins, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length of human Daxx fused to the LexA protein, LexA-Daxx, as bait. A plasmid library constructed by fusing the transcription activation domain to the individual cDNA prepared from human testis was screened for the interaction between LexA-Daxx and its interacting proteins in the yeast L40 reporter strain. A total of 106 transformants were screened by a selection for His prototrophy on yeast dropout medium lacking histidine. Positive clones were confirmed by the expression of β-galactosidase in X-gal filter assays. Among the 87 His+ and β-galactosidase positive clones examined, three independent clones (amino acids 15–50, 5–46, and 14–22) were identified to encode for different but overlapping portions of an identical protein. Sequence analyses revealed that the inserts from these individual clones corresponded to the NH2-terminal region of MSP58 protein (19Ren Y. Busch R.K. Perlaky L. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the MSP58 protein along with the clones interacting with LexA-Daxx is shown in Fig.1 A, top panel. The interactions between the fusion protein encoded by these three clones and Daxx were specific, because other fusion proteins such as LexA-lamin or LexA-MST3 (a serine/threonine kinase) did not confer the same magnitude of β-galactosidase activity elicited by LexA-Daxx as determined by the quantitation X-gal assay of transformed yeasts (Fig.1 A, bottom panel). MSP58 protein has been reported to interact with the proliferation-related nucleolar protein p120 (19Ren Y. Busch R.K. Perlaky L. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MSP58 contains unique NH2-terminal serine-rich clusters and the COOH-terminal region with a coiled coil domain. The COOH-terminal region of MSP58 is required for binding to p120 by domain-mapping studies (19Ren Y. Busch R.K. Perlaky L. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific and distinct interaction of Daxx with the fusion protein of these three isolated clones indicated that Daxx binds to the NH2-terminal region spanning amino acids 1–291 of MSP58, which is distinguished from the previously reported p120-interacting domain. To further verify the protein interaction between Daxx and full-length MSP58 in yeast, the full-length MSP58 cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primer pairs designed that correspond to the nucleotide sequence of human MSP58. The derived MSP58 cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the pACT2 vector, GalAD-MSP58, and subsequently analyzed with different bait proteins (lamin, MST3, Daxx, and PML) for the ability to activate HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes (Fig. 1 B). Yeast co-transformed with GalAD-MSP58, and LexA-Daxx was able to form colonies in the medium plate lacking histidine, indicating a positive interaction between MSP58 and Daxx. Again, the interaction is specific, because no interaction was detected between MSP58 and lamin or MST3 or PML, whereas the interactions between SUMO-1 and Daxx and PML served as positive controls. The interaction was further verified by liquid β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated that MSP58 interacts with Daxx in a specific manner in yeast. To delineate the region(s) of Daxx, which is involved in MSP58-Daxx interaction, various deletion constructs of Daxx were engineered and subjected to analyses in yeast two-hybrid assay. The strength of interaction was quantified by liquid β-galactosidase assay. As shown in Fig. 2, the COOH terminus-deleted Daxx (amino acids 1–501 and 1–625) interacted with MSP58 approximately 2- and 3-fold, respectively, more strongly than that conferred by the full-length Daxx. In contrast, the deletion of amino acid residues 1–501 of Daxx completely abolished its interaction with MSP58. These results implicated the NH2-terminal region of Daxx as being sufficient for stable interaction with MSP58. To further confirm these observed interactions in vitro, GST pull-down experiments were carried out using GST-MSP58 fusion protein and a battery of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Daxx fragments. As shown in Fig.2 B, the full-length Daxx was specifically pulled down by GST-MSP58 but not by GST protein. In agreement with the results of yeast two-hybrid assays, the COOH terminus-deleted Daxx-(1–625) or Daxx-(1–501) bound to GST-MSP58, whereas Daxx-(501–740) failed to do so. To locate the domains in the Daxx that interact with MSP58, Daxx-(1–501) fragment was further engineered into two separate fragments, Daxx-(1–250) and Daxx-(250–501), and assayed by the GST pull-down assay. Clearly, both Daxx-(1–250) and Daxx-(250–501) can specifically interact with MSP58 to the extent compared with that of Daxx-(1–501). As a negative control, no interaction was observed between the COOH-terminal fragment Daxx-(625–740) and MSP58 despite that COOH-terminal region of Daxx (amino acid residues 625–740) was previously identified as a binding domain for other interacting proteins including Fas, PML, Pax3, Ubc9, and SUMO-1. Taken together, the results from our in vitro studies further confirm our observation made in the yeast two-hybrid experiments. In addition, the NH2-terminal region of Daxx is sufficient and indispensable for its interaction with MSP58. To establish whether MSP58 interacts with Daxx in mammalian cells, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with expression constructs encoding FLAG-MSP58 and HA-Daxx. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation assays with anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Daxx was detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes of MSP58 (top panel,lane 4). This interaction was also validated in a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay (second panel, lane 4). To further confirm that the subdomain of Daxx is involved in MSP58 binding, we also used various engineered Daxx expression constructs harboring Daxx-(1–625), Daxx-(1–501), and Daxx-(501–740) fragments, respectively, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with MSP58. The protein expression levels of full-length Daxx deletion mutants Daxx-(1–625) and Daxx-(1–501) were comparable. However, the Daxx-(501–740) fragment was detected as a broadly migrating species on immunoblots. At present, it is not clear whether the high molecular weight form of Daxx-(501–740) reflects further posttranslational modification. This putative modification of Daxx-(501–740) was reproducibly observed in the lysates of transfected 293T or HeLa cells (data not shown). Notably, the deletion of the NH2-terminal region of Daxx resulted in a loss of its association with MSP58 as demonstrated by a lack of detection of the HA-Daxx-(501–740) protein in the immunoprecipitates of MSP58 (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). Conversely, the COOH-terminal region deletion mutants Daxx-(1–625) and Daxx-(1–501), similar to wild-type Daxx, retained its interaction with MSP58 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3–5). In consistent with our in vitro binding studies (Fig. 2), our findings suggest that the Daxx and MSP58 form a complex in cell, and the NH2-terminal region of Daxx is necessary and sufficient for its specific interaction with MSP58. Because MSP58 was identified as a Daxx-interacting protein and Daxx is known to possess strong transcriptional repression activity, we decided to investigate the role of MSP58 in the regulation of transcriptional repression activity of Daxx. To achieve this goal, Gal4-Daxx was co-transfected with the increasing amounts of full-length MSP58 into COS-1 and HeLa cells. The transcriptional activity of a luciferase reporter gene construct containing five copies of a Gal4 binding site within its promoter was then assessed. As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, Gal4-Daxx clearly repressed pG5-luciferase reporter expression in both COS-1 and HeLa cells when compared with the reporter activity of the cells co-transfected with equal amounts of Gal4-DBD. Interestingly, the co-exp"

The enzyme exhibited apparentKm values for UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc of 3.44 and 31.6 μm, respectively, and absolutely required acceptors of chondroitin sulfate polymers and oligosaccharides at least longer than a tetrasaccharide. In addition, chondroitin polymers and oligosaccharides and hyaluronan polymers and oligosaccharides served as acceptors for chondroitin polymerization, but dermatan sulfate and heparin did not.

The soluble enzyme expressed in a bacterial expression system transferred GalNAc and GlcUA residues alternately, and polymerized the chondroitin chain up to a molecular mass of 20 kDa when chondroitin sulfate hexasaccharide was used as an acceptor. The enzyme exhibited apparentKm values for UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc of 3.44 and 31.6 μm, respectively, and absolutely required acceptors of chondroitin sulfate polymers and oligosaccharides at least longer than a tetrasaccharide. In addition, chondroitin polymers and oligosaccharides and hyaluronan polymers and oligosaccharides served as acceptors for chondroitin polymerization, but dermatan sulfate and heparin did not. These results may lead to elucidation of the mechanism for chondroitin chain synthesis in both microorganisms and mammals. chondroitin sulfate kilobase pairs open reading frame Chondroitin sulfate (CS)1 is a glycosaminoglycan having a repeated disaccharide unit consisting ofd-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc), with sulfate residues at various positions. Proteoglycans having CS chains are abundant in cartilage (1Kimata K. Okayama M. Ooira A. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1646-1653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aorta, skeletal muscle, eye (2Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyaishi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J.

They are synthesized intracellularly and secreted to form a macromolecular complex in the extracellular matrix or localized on the cell surface. Biosynthesis of the CS chain of CS-proteoglycans occurs in the Golgi apparatus (6Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the linkage tetrasaccharide, GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl, is synthesized onto a serine residue of the core protein by sequential addition. Then a chondroitin chain is synthesized onto the linkage by the alternating addition of monosaccharide units of GalNAc and GlcUA. During the polymerization, the chain undergoes sulfation at various positions with a variety of sulfotransferases (7Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Many animal species produce CS chains, including Drosophila (8Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol.

Although bacteria do not produce CS chains, some Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli K4 contain polysaccharides similar to CS chains in their capsule. The K4 antigen capsule contains a polysaccharide of chondroitin (GlcUA β(1–3)-GalNAc β(1–4))n to which fructose is β-linked at position C-3 of the GlcUA residue (14Rodriguez M.-L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The addition of fructose branches occurs after the chondroitin elongation (15Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2682-2687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the glycosyltransferases needed to achieve chain polymerization and modification have not been identified. Studies on gene clusters of group 2 K antigens including K1, K5, K7, K12, and K92 have revealed a genomic organization of three functional regions conserved in a number of E. coli strains (16Roberts I.S. Mountford R. High N. Bitter-Suermann D. Jann K. Timmis T. Boulnois G. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1228-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Roberts I.S. Mountford R. Hodge R. Jann K.B. Boulnois G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boulnois G.J. Jann K. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Regions 1 and 3 at both ends are common among the group 2 K antigen gene clusters and express various proteins such as capsule-specific CMP-2-keto-3-deoxymanno-octonic acid synthetase, a stabilizer of the polysaccharide biosynthetic complex, and the ATP-binding cassette transporters. In contrast, the central region termed region 2, containing genes that encode enzymes for the synthesis of the specific K antigen, determines the polysaccharide structure. The nucleotide sequence of region 2 of the E. coli K5 capsule gene cluster has recently been determined (GenBankTM accession numberX77617) (19Petit C. Rigg G.P. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Stevens M. Boulnois G. Jann K. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This region contains four genes termed kfiA, -B, -C, and -D. The polypeptides of KfiA and KfiC show activity of both GlcNAc and GlcUA transferases (20Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Hodson N. Griffiths G. Cook N. Pourhossein M. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27311-27315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas KfiB is a protein associated with KfiC and KfiA on the cytoplasmic membrane, and KfiD is a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. These proteins, likely forming a complex, may synthesize the K5 polysaccharide (N-acetylheparosan)(GlcUA β(1–4)-GlcNAc α(1–4))n. Because the K4 antigen is a member of the group 2 K antigen family (22Jann B. Jann K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 19-42PubMed Google Scholar) and both the K4 and K5 capsules contain glycosaminoglycan backbones, the K4 strain may possess a similar gene cluster to K5. Actually, regions 1 and 3 of the K4 gene show high homology to those of K5. Thus, we hypothesized that region 2 of the K4 gene cluster contains enzymes responsible for chondroitin polymerization. In this study, we found that the K4 antigen gene cluster exhibits a genomic structure similar to K5. Then we cloned region 2 of the K4 capsular gene cluster and identified a bifunctional glycosyltransferase (chondroitin polymerase) gene within the region. The enzyme was further characterized as a soluble recombinant protein expressed in a bacterial expression system. E. coli strain K4, serotype O5:K4(L):H4 (ATCC 23502) (14Rodriguez M.-L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and strain K5, serotype O10:K5(L):H4 (ATCC 23506) (23Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. UDP-[14C]GlcUA (0.125 Ci/mmol), UDP-[3H]GalNAc (1.0 Ci/mmol), and UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (0.3 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. UDP-GlcUA, UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-GlcNAc were from Sigma. CS from shark cartilage (Mr 20,000), chemically desulfated chondroitin (Mr 10,000) from CS (24Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 97: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), dermatan sulfate from pig skin (Mr15,000), heparin from porcine intestine (Mr10,000), and hyaluronan from chick comb (Mr800,000) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. Oligosaccharides of CS (tetra- and hexasaccharides), chondroitin (tetra- and hexasaccharides), and hyaluronan (tetra-, hexa-, octa-, deca-, and tetradecasaccharides) and short chains of hyaluronan (Mr 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000) were prepared by partial digestion of CS, chondroitin, or hyaluronan with hyaluronidase from sheep testis (Sigma) and separation by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography (25Yamagata M. Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Maeda N. Yoshida K. Shimomura Y. Yoneda M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4146-4152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CS heptasaccharide was enzymically prepared by adding GalNAc to the hexasaccharide using K4 chondroitin polymerase (KfoC) obtained in this study. Briefly, 350 nmol of CS hexasaccharide and 1.5 μmol of UDP-GalNAc were incubated in the reaction buffer (500 μl) containing purified recombinant K4 chondroitin polymerase (16 μg of protein) at 30 °C for 1 h. The heptasaccharide product was separated with a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30-pg (Amersham Biosciences) column. Genomic DNA ofE. coli cells prepared by the reported method (26Stauffer G.J. Plamann M.D. Stauffer L.T. Gene (Amst.). 1981; 14: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was digested with Sau3AI, and the library was constructed from λ EMBL3 (Stratagene) and the digests, using Gigapack III Gold Packaging kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probes were prepared by PCR using two sets of primers whose sequences were derived from those of K5 (GenBankTMaccession numbers X74567 and X53819) and K4 genomic DNA as template. The sets of primers are CS-S (5′-ACCCAACACTGCTACAACCTATATCGG-3′) and CS-AS (5′-GCGTCTTCACCAATAAATACCCACGAAACT-3′), and TM-S (5′-CGAGAAATACGAACACGCTTTGGTAA-3′) and TM-AS (5′-ACTCAATTTTCTCTTTCAGCTCTTCTTG-3′). The PCR profile was 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 47 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 5 min, and 72 °C for 10 min for region 1; and 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 5 min, and 72 °C for 10 min for region 3. The PCR products (K4RI3, 1.3 kbp in region 1, and K4RIII5, 1.0 kbp in region 3, see Fig. 1) were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The λ phage library of E. coli K4 genomic DNA was screened with the 32P-labeled PCR products (K4RI3 and K4RIII5). The plaque-transferred filters (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences) were hybridized with the 32P-labeled K4RI3 DNA probe for 15 h at 65 °C in 0.5 m Church's phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (27Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar), 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS, after prehybridization for 1 h at 65 °C. The filters were washed three times with 40 mm Church's phosphate buffer containing 1% SDS for 15 min each at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray films. For removal of probes the filters were treated in boiled 0.5% SDS for 3 min and then rehybridized with 32P-labeled K4RIII5 DNA probe in the same manner. Positive clones were rescreened until a single plaque was obtained. Positive phage DNA clones were digested with EcoRI and/or SalI and subcloned into pBluescript II KS(−) cloning vector. DNA sequencing of both strands of the inserts was performed using ABI PRISM 310 analyzer and DNA sequencer model 4200 (Aloka). The obtained DNA sequence was completed and analyzed using Genetyx-mac computer programs (Software Development). A DNA fragment expected to contain the K4 chondroitin polymerase gene (kfoC) in K4 region 2 was amplified by PCR with a set of primers and K4 DNA clones as template using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The sequence of the sense primer is 5′-CGGGATCCCGATGAGTATTCTTAATCAAGC-3′ located at the amino terminus of the open reading frame (ORF) with a BamHI linker site. The sequence of the antisense primer is 5′-GGAATTCCGGCCAGTCTACATGTTTATCAC-3′, corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the ORF and an EcoRI linker site. The PCR product was purified using a Gel Extraction KitTM (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, inserted into pTrcHis expression vector (Invitrogen), and transformed into E. coli strain TOP10. A clone containing the desired ORF was selected and cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 was ∼0.6. β-Isopropylthiogalactoside (1 mm final) was then added to the culture, and the bacteria were further cultured for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and placed on ice for 30 min. After the suspension was sonicated on ice three times at 10-s intervals and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column. The expressed protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% glycerol for 2 days at 4 °C. Protein content was determined using a micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard protein. Chondroitin polymerase activity was monitored using UDP-[14C]GlcUA and UDP-[3H]GalNAc as donor substrates and an acceptor substrate such as CS hexasaccharide as reported previously (28DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, the reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in a 50-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mmMnCl2, 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4, 1 m ethylene glycol, the donor and acceptor substrates at the indicated concentrations, and the enzyme preparation. This was followed by boiling for 1 min to stop the reaction. Then 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate was added, and the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 μl of distilled water, and the solution was applied to a Superdex peptide HR10/30 column, a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column, or a Superdex 30 pg 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl, and eluted with 0.2m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5–1.0 ml/min. The eluate was fractionated (0.5–1.0 ml/tube), and the radioactivity of each fraction was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The chondroitin polymerase activity was determined by calculating the amount of radioactivity incorporated into fractions with a higher molecular mass than the acceptor substrate. Some of the reaction products were treated with chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase ACII, Streptomyceshyaluronidase, and heparitinase I (Seikagaku Co.) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. To determine the donor substrate specificity of the recombinant enzyme, different combinations of UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GlcUA were used. Double-reciprocal plots of the incorporation activities (v) and the substrate concentrations of one UDP-sugar (S) while holding the other at a constant concentration gave apparent Km values of recombinant chondroitin polymerase protein for UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc. To determine the acceptor substrate specificity, oligosaccharides (CS tetra- and heptasaccharides, chondroitin tetra- and hexasaccharides, and hyaluronan hexasaccharide) or polysaccharides (CS, chondroitin, hyaluronan, and heparin) were used. Effects of pH, temperature, time, and metal ion on the enzyme reaction were also examined. SDS-PAGE of proteins was carried out on a 10% gel by the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For Western blotting, proteins on the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was treated with anti-tetra-His antibody (Qiagen), after blocking with 5% skim milk in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). After several washes with TBS-T, the membrane was treated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. After washes with TBS-T, reactive proteins were detected with the ECL detection system (AmershamBiosciences). Preliminary Southern blot analysis revealed that E. coli K4 genomic DNA digests obtained with various restriction enzymes hybridized with probes of region 1 and region 3 of the K5 capsule gene (data not shown), suggesting that E. coli K4 possesses a capsule gene cluster similar to K5. Thus, we hypothesized that regions 1 and 3 of K4 could be obtained by PCR, which could in turn be used for the cloning of region 2. Two PCR products, K4RI3 (1.3 kbp) and K4RIII5 (1.0 kbp), obtained from E. coli K4 exhibited 96 and 95% sequence identity to regions 1 and 3 of the K5 gene, respectively (Fig.1, A and B). By using these PCR products as probes, we screened an E. coligenomic library and obtained 30 positive clones. By a second screening, four and six plaques were selected using K4RIII5 and K4RI3, respectively (Fig. 1C). One of the selected clones, CS23 (14.5 kbp), hybridized with both probes, indicating that these clones contained a full-length region 2. After construction of the restriction map, several DNA fragments cleaved by appropriate overlapping restriction enzymes were subcloned and sequenced on both strands to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of K4 region 2. The 5′ and 3′ termini of CS23 insert DNA were identical to thekpsS gene of region 1 and kpsT gene of region 3, respectively. By using the GenBankTM homology search BLAST system in NCBI, seven ORFs in region 2 of the K4 capsule gene were predicted and named kfo (K, four)A–G like in the K5 gene (19Petit C. Rigg G.P. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Stevens M. Boulnois G. Jann K. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and one insertion sequence-2 (IS2) (30Ghosal D. Sommer H. Saedler H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was located between kfoC and kfoD (Fig. 1B). The predicted first polypeptide, KfoA of 339 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 38,040, showed high homology to UDP-glucose 4-epimerase from Pasteurella multocida (31May B.J.

KfoB (546 amino acids, calculatedMr 63,567) exhibited considerable homology to KfiB (38% identity) of the E. coli K5 capsule gene cluster (19Petit C. Rigg G.P. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V.

Frost A.J. Adler B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), both of which are involved in capsule production. KfoC (686 amino acids, calculated Mr 79,256) containing two conserved glycosyltransferase sites, showed 59% identity to class 2 hyaluronan synthase (35DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M.

However, this gene was shorter than either of these enzymes, lacking a carboxyl-terminal membrane association domain. Fig.2 shows aligned sequences of the three polypeptides. Although all of them have two consensus β-glycosyltransferase motifs (36DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the motifs in KfoC showed only 14 and 19% amino acid identity to those in KfiA and KfiC, reported as GlcNAc and GlcUA transferases of E. coli K5, respectively (20Griffiths G.

KfoD (488 amino acids, calculated Mr 56,100) and KfoE (522 amino acids, calculated Mr 60,805) had significant homology to BcbD (35% identity) and BcbG (36% identity) of P. multocida (37Boyce J.D. Chung J.Y. Adler B. Vet. Microbiol. 2000; 72: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), respectively, both of which are likely involved in bacterial capsule production. KfoF (389 amino acids, calculated Mr 43,716), with significant homology to a number of UDP-glucose dehydrogenases, showed high homology to KfiD (75% identity) (19Petit C. Rigg G.P. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Stevens M. Boulnois G. Jann K. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). KfoG (345 amino acids, calculatedMr 39,060) containing a glycosyltransferase motif, showed 44% amino acid identity to P. multocida DcbD glycosyltransferase (34Townsend K.M. Boyce J.D. Chung J.Y. Frost A.J. Adler B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein has glycosyltransferase activity. Insertion sequence 2 (IS2) of 1,331 bp, located between kfoC and kfoD, was a transposable DNA element (38Hu S.T. Yang M.K. Spandau D.F. Lee C.H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 55: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 39Ronecker H.J. Rak B. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The IS2 sequence also contained an ORF encoding “transposase” (96% identity) (40Hu S.T. Lee C.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results obtained by sequence analyses indicated that region 2 of K4 consists of genes for the synthesis of a specific capsular polysaccharide similar to that of K5. As KfoC was expected to have chondroitin polymerase activity, we expressed KfoC using a bacterial expression system. An ORF of the kfoC gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into an expression plasmid (pTrcHis-kfoC). TOP10 cells were transformed with the expression construct, and the recombinant polypeptide was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding 0.2 mg of protein per 50 ml of culture. As predicted, the expressed protein showed an 80-kDa band by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses using anti-tetra-His antibody (Fig.3). In contrast, the culture extracts from the empty vector transformant showed no immunologically reactive band. Chondroitin polymerase activity was assayed using a purified recombinant KfoC tagged with His6. First, we used CS hexasaccharide as an acceptor (60 pmol) and UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc as donors (1 nmol each) either of which was labeled. When the sample after the reaction was applied to a high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration column, a product with a peak of ∼5,000 Da was separated from nucleotide monosaccharides or the degraded saccharides (Fig.4). No incorporated product was found in the absence of the acceptor (data not shown). All of these incorporated products were completely digested by chondroitinase ABC,indicating that they were chondroitin chains (Fig. 4). When these digests were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography for glycosaminoglycan disaccharide component assay (41Yoshida K. Miyauchi S. Kikuchi H. Tawada A. Tokuyasu K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), only unsaturated nonsulfated chondroitin disaccharide was detected (data not shown). Chondroitinase ACII also completely digested the reaction products, whereas Streptomyces hyaluronidase and heparitinase I did not (data not shown). Next we performed a time course analysis. The enzyme rapidly incorporated [3H]GalNAc in 3 h as shown in Fig.5B, and after 6 h it slowly incorporated the radioactivity for 18 h under the described conditions. Fig. 5A shows the gel filtration pattern of [3H]GalNAc incorporation at various incubation times (10 min to 18 h). With a longer incubation, the incorporation increased, and products with a higher molecular mass were obtained. At lower concentrations of the acceptor hexasaccharide, products with a higher molecular mass were rapidly obtained. In contrast, products with a lower molecular mass were obtained with higher concentrations of the acceptor (data not shown). When UDP-GalNAc alone was used as a donor substrate, heptasaccharide was produced from a CS hexasaccharide whose nonreduced end is GlcUA. When CS heptasaccharide was used as an acceptor whose nonreduced end is GalNAc, GalNAc was not transferred to this donor (Fig. 6 and Table I). In contrast, when UDP-GlcUA alone was used, no product was obtained from the CS hexasaccharide, but an octasaccharide was obtained from the CS heptasaccharide. When UDP-GlcNAc alone was used as a donor and the CS hexasaccharide was used as an acceptor, the enzyme showed slight incorporation (∼6%) of GlcNAc and made a heptasaccharide (Table I). However, an octasaccharide or longer saccharide was not obtained even in the presence of both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA (Table I and Fig. 4). No incorporation occurred in the absence of an acceptor, indicating that an acceptor substrate is essential for chondroitin polymerization (data not shown).Table IIncorporation of radiolabeled sugars into chondroitin oligosaccharides by the recombinant K4 chondroitin polymerase KfoCChondroitin polymerase-specific activity nmol/min/mg protein1-aThe values given are the mean ± S.D.

A major pathway for post-translational regulation of p53 comprises its nucleocytoplasmic transport and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which involves binding to the oncoprotein, murine double minute-2 (Mdm2). Hypoxia and other stress signals cause cellular injury partly through the action of p53. In this study, we show that hypoxia induces down-regulation of Mdm2 as well as serine 15 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of p53 in cultured cortical neurons from E16 mice. These effects are diminished by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190, but not by the inactive analog SB202474, and by a dominant-interfering mutant of the p38-activating kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3). Hypoxic neuronal death was also reduced by p38 inhibitors, by dominant-interfering MKK3, and by a p53-antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and was increased by a constitutively active form of p38 and by an Mdm2-antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. These results demonstrate that p38 and Mdm2 have roles in coupling hypoxic-ischemic neuronal insults to activation of p53 and hypoxic cell death.

Like other stress signals, neuronal hypoxia and ischemia cause DNA damage and cell death partly by promoting nuclear accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (1Halterman M.W. Federoff H.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,2Halterman M.W. Miller C.C. Federoff H.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6818-6824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p53 is a multifunctional protein that has a critical role in various pathways controlling cellular responses to stress signals (for reviews, see Refs. 3Almog N. Rotter V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: R43-R54PubMed Google Scholar and 4Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). p53 is normally expressed at low levels, in a latent form that is unable to bind specifically to DNA, by rapid degradation through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (5Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar). With stress, p53 accumulates via multiple mechanisms, including enhanced translation, decreased proteolytic degradation, and post-translational modification (6Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 7Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 8She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, its half-life is extended from 30 to >200 min, contributing to an increase in p53 protein levels (7Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The murine double minute-2 (Mdm2)1 oncoprotein, a product of a p53-reponsive gene, is a major inhibitor of p53 function and abundance (9Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Mdm2 was originally identified as an amplified gene in a spontaneously transformed derivative of the BALB/c cell line, 3T3 DM (9Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The Mdm2 gene contains a p53 DNA-binding site and a genetically responsive element such that expression of Mdm2 can be regulated by the level of wild-type p53 protein. The Mdm2 protein, in turn, can complex with p53 and decrease its ability to act as a positive transcription factor (10Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to antagonize p53-dependent transcription, Mdm2 can also promote degradation of p53 through a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (6Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T., Wu, X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and may have an additional role in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p53. This establishes a negative feedback loop, in which p53 initiates its own Mdm2-mediated destruction (10Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 12Picksley S.M. Lane D.P. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 689-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications of p53 include phosphorylation and acetylation (8She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 13Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and serine 20 leads to reduced binding to Mdm2, which enhances p53 accumulation (8She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 14Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Finally, reduced expression of Mdm2 has been implicated in the induction of p53 by hypoxia in non-neuronal cells (15Alarcon R. Koumenis C. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051PubMed Google Scholar). How neuronal hypoxia or ischemia regulates p53 is unknown, but hypoxia influences a variety of signal transduction mechanisms, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways (16Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar, 17Muller J.M. Krauss B. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Rupec R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22368-22374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Among the MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) has been widely associated with cell survival, whereas c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 are often implicated in cell death (16Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar, 19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar). However, the actual roles of each MAPK cascade are highly cell type- and context-dependent (16Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). In the mouse JB6 epidermal cell line, activated ERK and p38, but not JNK, phosphorylates p53 at serine 15 and reduces binding of p53 to Mdm2 (8She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), whereas in mouse fibroblasts, JNK associates with p53 and promotes its ubiquitination (20Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z., Wu, X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Stress signals can also up-regulate p38 in neurons (19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 21Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y.

Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For example, NO donors activate p38 and induce apoptosis in cortical neurons without activating JNK, and the p38 MAPK activity inhibitor SB203580 protects cortical neurons from NO-induced cell death (22Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These and related findings prompted us to assess the relationship between p38 activity and levels of Mdm2 and p53 in primary cultures of cortical neurons subjected to hypoxic insults. We report here evidence that suggests a role for p38 MAPK in regulating Mdm2 and p53 levels in hypoxic neurons. The MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059, the p38 inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580, and the structurally related but inactive analog SB202474, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X, the tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor genistein, and the Src family kinase inhibitor herbimycin A were from Calbiochem.

Rabbit anti-p53, polyclonal anti-phospho(Ser15)-p53, polyclonal anti-phospho(Thr202/Tyr204)-MAPK (ERK1/2), anti-phospho(Thr180/Tyr182)-p38 MAPK, and anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Rabbit anti-ERK 1/2 polyclonal antibody was from Promega. Mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Media and sera were obtained from Invitrogen. Primary neuronal cultures were established as previously described (23Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 24Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cerebral cortex was dissected from fetal CD1 mice at 16 days of gestation, treated with trypsin for 3 min at 37 °C, and dissociated by trituration. Dissociated cell suspensions were plated at 3.5 × 105cells/cm2 on plastic tissue culture dishes coated with poly-d-lysine, in defined medium (Neurobasal/B27, Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (25 units/ml), and streptomycin (25 μg/ml). Cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 days before treatment. Under these conditions, cultures contained ∼95% neurons as reported previously (25Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10242-10247Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To induce hypoxia, cells were placed in modular incubator chambers (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) for 0–24 h at 37 °C in humidified 95% N2, 5% CO2(25Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10242-10247Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of signaling pathways on Mdm2 and p53 expression, the inhibitors listed above were added 1 h before the onset of hypoxia. Northern blotting was carried out as described previously (26Zhu Y. Hon T. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA from treated and untreated cells was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA from each sample was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde/agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (AmershamBiosciences). Filters were hybridized with probes for Mdm2 mRNA, p53 mRNA, and β-actin mRNA at 68 °C in hybridization buffer (CLONTECH).32P-Radiolabeled DNA probes were synthesized using cDNA obtained from reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification. Primers used were: p53 forward, 5′-ATGGAGGAGTCACAGTCGGATA-3′; p53 reverse, 5′-GACTTCTTGTAGATGGCCATGG-3′; Mdm2 forward, 5′-TCAGCAAGACTCTGGCACATC-3′; Mdm2 reverse, 5′-TTCCGAGTCCAGAGACTCAAC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-CACAGGCATTGTGATGGACTC-3′; β-actin reverse, 5′-GCTCAGGAGGAGCAATGATCT-3′. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared by adding 10 volumes of 1 × sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 10% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. Nuclear extractions were performed as previously described (27Deryckere F. Gannon F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 405PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, and then resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine). The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min before adding Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.6%, vortexed, and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction, and the nuclear pellet was washed with buffer A (without Nonidet P-40) and suspended in buffer B (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. The nuclear extract was collected, and protein concentration was determined using Bradford protein assays (Bio-Rad); 40 μg of protein was analyzed by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to ImmunoBlot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with primary antibody overnight, and the signal was detected with Roche Molecular Biochemicals chemiluminescence blotting kits. Cortical neurons were transiently transfected at day 3 using a Ca3(PO4)2 co-precipitation protocol as previously described (19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 28Namgung U. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 17: 6442-6451Crossref Google Scholar). Expression constructs encoding constitutively active MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3) (pRc/RSV-Fla-MKK3 (Glu)) and dominant negative MKK3 (pRc/RSV-Fla-MKK3 (Ala)) (29Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T.

Davis, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School. Briefly, the DNA-Ca3(PO4)2complexes were prepared by mixing 8 μg of DNA per 35-mm dish with 2.5m CaCl2 and 2 × Hepes-buffered saline (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mmNa2HPO4, 15 mm d-glucose, and 42 mm Hepes, pH 7.07). The precipitates were allowed to form for 20–50 min before addition to the cultures. Cells were washed three times with modified Eagle's medium, and 1.5 ml of transfection medium was added to each 35-mm dish. The transfection medium consisted of Neurobasal/B27 supplemented with 1 mm sodium kynurenate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes. The solution containing DNA precipitates was added dropwise to the cultures and gently mixed. After 1 h, the cells were washed three times with modified Eagle's medium and were treated with 1 × Hepes-buffered saline (see above), 1 mm sodium kynurenate, 10 mm MgCl2in 5 mm Hepes, and 5% glycerol for 2 min. Cells were then washed three times with modified Eagle's medium, and the conditioned medium was added back to each dish; 24 h later, the cells were harvested for analysis. An expression construct encoding green fluorescent protein (pEGFP, CLONTECH) was used to verify transfection efficiency and as a control. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector), and viewed by Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscopy. A phosphorothioate antisense ODN (MAS20) labeled with fluorescein at the 5′ end and directed against the initial coding region of the target Mdm2 mRNA (5′-GACATGTTGGTATTGCACAT-3′), a scrambled MX20 ODN (5′-GACATGTTGCTATTGCACAT-3′) (30Trinh E. Boutillier A.L. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a phosphorothioate antisense ODN (p53as) labeled with fluorescein at the 5′ end and directed against the initial coding region of the target p53 mRNA (GenBankTMaccession number AF161020) (5′-ATGGCAGTCATCCAGT-3′), and a sense p53S ODN (5′-ACTGGATGACTGCCAT-3′) were synthesized commercially (Operon Technologies) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Cultures were transfected with ODNs (5 μm) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 10 h, cells were re-treated with ODNs (5 μm) and maintained in culture for another 24–48 h, when they were analyzed for cell viability assay and for protein expression by Western blotting. Neuronal cell viability was assessed by measuring formazan produced by the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) in viable cells. Cells were incubated with 5 mg/ml MTT at 37 °C for 2 h. The medium was removed and cells were solubilized with dimethyl sulfoxide and transferred to 96-well plates. The formazan reduction product was detected by measuring absorbance at 570 nm in a Cytofluor Series 4000 multiwell plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Results were expressed as a percentage of control absorbance, measured in normoxic cultures, after subtracting background absorbance (measured in freeze-thawed cultures) from all values. Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three experiments. Analysis of variance and Student's t test were used for statistical analysis, withp < 0.05 considered significant. To determine whether hypoxia alters the expression ofp53 and Mdm2 genes in neurons cultured from mouse cerebral cortex, cells were deprived of oxygen for 0–24 h, total RNA was extracted, and p53 and Mdm2 expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. Mdm2 was prominently down-regulated in a time-dependent manner, whilep53 increased, compared with the control gene, β-actin (Fig. 1). Western analysis of Mdm2 and p53 proteins in nuclei and cytoplasm of cells fractionated after 0–24 h of hypoxia showed a reduction in Mdm2 protein levels in both compartments and an increase in nuclear p53 (Fig.2 A). Each of these changes was detectable after 4 h and persisted for at least 24 h. At all times examined, Mdm2 expression was most pronounced in the cytoplasm, and p53 predominated in the nucleus.Figure 2Time course of Mdm2 and p53 protein expression and phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in response to hypoxia. Cortical neurons were harvested after the indicated periods (h) of hypoxia. Protein samples (40 μg) were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for Western analysis. Mdm2 and p53 protein from nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (A) and Ser15 phospho-p53 from whole cell extracts (B) were detected with the anti-Mdm2, anti-p53, and anti-Ser15 phospho-p53 antibodies described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data shown are representative blots from three independent experiments per panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 helps to regulate p53 stability by reducing its interaction with Mdm2 and has been reported after UV exposure (8She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that p53 is also phosphorylated in response to hypoxia, we analyzed cell extracts from normoxic and hypoxic cortical neurons by Western blotting with an antibody directed against serine 15 phospho-p53. As shown in Fig.2 B, the level of serine 15 phospho-p53 increased as the duration of hypoxia increased up to 16 h and then declined at 24 h, perhaps due to hypoxic cell death. In contrast to the effect of hypoxia on serine 15 phosphorylation, no change in serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 could be detected (not shown). The specific signal transduction pathways involved in cellular responses to hypoxia vary with cell type; for example, HeLa cells respond with a rapid but transient activation of ERK (17Muller J.M. Krauss B. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Rupec R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23435-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas p38 (but not JNK) is selectively activated in PC12 cells (31Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of Mdm2 and serine 15 phosphorylation and up-regulation of p53 in hypoxic cortical neurons, we measured changes in the expression of phosphoactivated forms of ERK, p38, and JNK. Using phosphospecific antibodies against ERK, p38, and JNK, we found that phospho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2 were present at low levels in normoxic neuronal cultures and that exposure to hypoxia for 4 to 24 h caused a progressive increase in immunoreactivity; phospho-p38 was also detected as early as 4 h after hypoxia and remained elevated for at least 24 h (Fig.3). In contrast, antibodies against total p38 or total ERK1/2 showed no hypoxia-induced change in expression. Thus, both ERK and p38 were phosphoactivated by hypoxia in cortical neurons, whereas hypoxia suppressed phosphoactivation of JNK. In this study, the level of p38 in cortical neurons appeared to be much lower than that of the other two MAPKs, although it became detectable when we used >150 μg of protein per lane. To investigate further which signaling pathways mediate the effects of hypoxia on Mdm2 and p53 in neurons, we used a series of kinase inhibitors to inactivate receptor tyrosine kinases, ERK, p38, JNK, PI3K, and PKC. We expected that if a particular kinase were critical for hypoxia's effects on Mdm2 and p53 signaling, inhibiting its activity should reverse these effects. As shown in Fig.4, the Src family kinase inhibitor herbimycin A (1 μm) (32Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) increased Mdm2 expression in hypoxic cultures, and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (5 μm) (33Gould G.W. Cuenda A. Thomson F.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) prevented hypoxic down-regulation of Mdm2, whereas the nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50 μm) (32Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) was ineffective, and the PKC inhibitor GF102390X (1 μm) (33Gould G.W. Cuenda A. Thomson F.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (2 μm) (18Alvarez-Tejado M. Naranjo-Suarez S. Jimenez C. Carrera A.C. Landazuri M.O. del Peso L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22368-22374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm) (33Gould G.W. Cuenda A. Thomson F.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) potentiated the effect of hypoxia on Mdm2. Genistein and SB203580 also blocked hypoxic up-regulation of p53, whereas the other inhibitors were less effective or inactive in this regard. As is also shown in Fig. 4, SB203580 and wortmannin markedly reduced hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15. Because only the p38 inhibitor SB203580 reversed all of the observed effects of hypoxia, down-regulation of Mdm2, up-regulation of p53, and serine 15 phosphorylation of p53, hypoxic regulation of Mdm2/p53 signaling appears to be mediated through p38. To verify further that this is the case and to control for nonspecific effects, we treated cells with another p38 inhibitor (SB202190, 4 μm) or with SB202474 (4 μm), an inactive analog of SB203580 and SB202190. Western blots showed that the effects of SB202190 and SB203580 on Mdm2 and p53 expression were similar, whereas SB202474 was ineffective (Fig.5 A). The p38 inhibitors appeared to act by blocking hypoxia-induced changes in Mdm2 and p53 expression specifically because neither inhibitor altered expression under normoxic conditions (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Effect of p38 MAPK inhibitors on Mdm2 and p53 protein expression. Cortical neurons were treated with the p38 inhibitors SB203580 (5 μm) or SB202190 (4 μm) or with the inactive analog SB202474 (4 μm) for 1 h prior to the onset of 16 h of hypoxia (A) or normoxia (B). Protein samples (40 μg) from whole cell extracts were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for Western analysis. Mdm2 and p53 from total cell extracts were detected with the anti-Mdm2 and anti-p53 antibodies described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data shown are representative blots from three independent experiments per panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the relationship between hypoxic induction of p38 and hypoxia-induced cell death, we first treated cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (5 or 10 μm), beginning 1 h prior to the onset of hypoxia. Treatment with SB203580 partially protected cortical neurons from hypoxic death, which was reduced by ∼60% at 8 h and by ∼40% at 16 h (Fig.6). Next we transfected cortical neurons with expression constructs encoding constitutively active or dominant-interfering mutants of MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3), which specifically phosphorylates and activates p38 (29Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 34D'erijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T., Wu, I.H. Han J.

Transfection efficiency was monitored using an expression construct encoding green fluorescent protein, which showed that 21 ± 2% (n = 8) of cells were transfected (Fig.7 A). In normoxic cultures, constitutively active MKK3(Glu) decreased cell viability by ∼25% (Fig. 7 B). In hypoxic cultures, dominant-interfering MKK3(Ala) increased viability by ∼20%, whereas dominant active MKK3(Glu) decreased viability by ∼25% of control. Western blots showed that in normoxic cultures, constitutively active MKK3(Glu) decreased Mdm2 and increased p53 expression (Fig. 7 C); in hypoxic cultures, these effects were enhanced, and dominant-interfering MKK3(Ala) produced opposite effects. These data suggest that activation of p38 plays an important role in hypoxia-induced changes in Mdm2 and p53 expression and associated cell death in neurons.Figure 7Constitutive activation or inactivation of MKK3 alters neuronal survival and Mdm2 and p53 expression.Cortical neurons were transfected for 24 h with 3 μg of plasmid DNA encoding a constitutively active form of MKK3 (Glu), 8 μg of plasmid DNA encoding a dominant-interfering MKK3 mutant (Ala), or 8 μg of control vector and then exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for an additional 16 h. A, to measure transfection efficiency, some cultures were transfected for 24 h with a vector expressing GFP (pEGFP) and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Transfection efficiency was calculated as GFP-expressing cells/4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells × 100%. B, cell viability was measured by MTT absorbance and expressed as a percentage (mean ± S.E., n = 3) of viability in normoxic cultures transfected with control vector (Vector). *, p < 0.05 relative to vector.C, protein samples (40 μg) from whole cell extracts were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for Western analysis, and Mdm2 and p53 were detected with the antibodies described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data shown are representative blots from three independent experiments per panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the functional consequences of hypoxic reduction of Mdm2 expression, we blocked Mdm2 expression with an antisense ODN (MAS20), which was transfected into cells for 24–48 h as described previously (36Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar); a scrambled ODN (MX20) was used as a control. As shown in Fig.8 A, blocking Mdm2 expression with MAS20 reduced cell viability by ∼40% under normoxic conditions and by ∼35% after hypoxia. Western blots showed that knockdown of Mdm2 by MAS20 reduced Mdm2 and increased p53 levels, as expected (Fig.8 B). To assess if p53 is required for hypoxic neuronal cell death, we transfected cells with a p53 antisense ODN that overlaps the translation start site. The p53 antisense ODN did not affect cell viability under normoxic conditions, relative to cells transfected with a sense ODN or treated with transfection reagent only. In contrast, in hypoxic cultures, the p53 antisense ODN increased neuronal viability from ∼40 to ∼70% (Fig. 9). Because basal p53 expression was barely detectable, it was not possible to discern a further decrease in expression after antisense treatment. The major finding of this study is that neuronal hypoxia transcriptionally down-regulates Mdm2 and post-transcriptionally up-regulates p53 and that both effects may be mediated through hypoxic activation of p38 MAPK. These events appear to have functional importance in regulating neuronal cell death and survival from hypoxia, because hypoxic neuronal death was reduced by p38 inhibitors, by a dominant-interfering mutant of the p38-activating kinase MKK3, and by a p53-antisense ODN and was increased by a constitutively active form of p38 and by an Mdm2-antisense ODN. The known and proposed roles of Mdm2 in regulating p53 function suggest that the effects of hypoxia on Mdm2 and p53 may be interrelated (37Lohrum M.A. Vousden K.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). First, because binding to Mdm2 promotes the proteasomal degradation of p53 through Mdm2's action as a ubiquitin ligase (36Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), reduction of Mdm2 expression by hypoxia could account for the observed increase in p53 levels in our hypoxic neuronal cultures. This is supported by our finding that an Mdm2-antisense ODN increased p53 abundance. Second, the observed increase in serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 would also be expected to increase p53 levels because this post-translational modification interferes with the interaction between p53 and Mdm2 that leads to p53 degradation (8She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Finally, some evidence suggests that Mdm2 may be involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p53 that translocates it from its site of action as a transcription factor to its site of proteolytic breakdown (36Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 39Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar); in this respect, too, reduced levels of Mdm2 are predicted to permit the enhanced nuclear accumulation of p53 that we observed. In addition to these effects on p53 protein expression, Mdm2 inhibits p53 function by binding to the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of p53 and acting as a negative regulator of p53-induced gene transcription (40Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Different stress signals produce distinct effects on Mdm2 expression. For example, the observed reduction in Mdm2 levels after hypoxia is consistent with the effect of UVC light irradiation of U2-OS cells, which reduces Mdm2 levels, whereas x-irradiation of the same cells increases Mdm2 levels (41Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2760) Google Scholar). In cultured cerebellar granule neurons, Mdm2 expression is decreased when medium is depleted of K+, which also leads to apoptotic cell death (30Trinh E. Boutillier A.L. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, in adrenalectomy-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, Mdm2 expression is increased (38Tan Z., Qu, W., Tu, W. Liu W. Baudry M. Schreiber S.S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mdm2, like p53, appears to be capable of promoting either cell death or cell survival, depending on the nature of the injurious stimulus. In the present study, the observation that an Mdm2-antisense ODN reduced neuronal viability argues for a survival-promoting effect of Mdm2 in this system. Hypoxic regulation of protein expression is mediated through several signal transduction pathways. We found evidence for increased activation of p38 MAPK, and p38 inhibitors blocked the up-regulation of p53 in our hypoxic neuronal cultures. Moreover, hypoxic induction of p53 was also reduced by a dominant-interfering form of MKK3, which activates p38. In contrast to the effect of hypoxia on p38, activation of JNK was decreased. However, JNK may still influence p53 levels in these cultures, since it has been reported that a JNK-p53 complex is found in some cells and that JNK may promote the ubiquitination of p53 under some conditions (20Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z., Wu, X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Whether suppression of JNK activation by hypoxia reduces the degradation of p53 in neurons requires further study. We thank Dr. Roger J. Davis for providing MKK3 expression constructs."

In this study, we designed experiments to test whether the co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and/or p300 interact with c-Maf, Prox-1, or Sox-1 to enhance transcription of crystallin genes. Promoter regions from the mouse αA-, βB2-, and γF-crystallin genes were linked to a luciferase reporter. Expression of c-Maf transactivated each of these promoters.

Maf response element CREB-binding protein N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid histone acetyltransferase luciferase β-galactosidase thymidine kinase During embryonic development, the ocular lens is formed as an invagination of the surface ectoderm. As differentiation proceeds, the lens forms a hollow sphere of epithelial cells termed the lens vesicle (1Piatigorsky J. Differentiation. 1981; 19: 134-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The cells located at the posterior surface of the lens vesicle are induced to differentiate into the primary lens fiber cells that elongate to fill the lens vesicle. The lens subsequently is comprised of a monolayer of proliferative cuboidal epithelial stem cells on the anterior surface overlying a core of elongated fiber cells (2Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3Kondoh H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Lens induction is accompanied by localized expression of several different transcription factors including Pax-6, Six-3, Sox-2, c-Maf, Prox-1, and Sox-1 (4Ogino H. Yasuda K. Dev. Growth Differ. 2000; 42: 437-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the developing and the mature lens there is a distinctive pattern of crystallin gene expression. The α-crystallins are expressed at the lens vesicle stage, and are produced by both lens epithelial and fiber cells. The β- and γ-crystallins are synthesized by the fiber cells, with the expression of most β-crystallins preceding the expression of the γ-crystallins (5McAvoy J.W. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1978; 44: 149-165PubMed Google Scholar, 6Treton J.A. Jacquemin E. Courtois Y. Jeanny J.C. Differentiation. 1991; 47: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Altogether, the crystallins constitute more than 90% of the soluble lens proteins (7Graw J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 387: 1331-1348Google Scholar, 8Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Science. 1987; 236: 1554-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies have shown that c-Maf, Prox1, and Sox1 are required for lens fiber cell differentiation and crystallin gene expression (9Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S.

Prox-1 and Sox-1 are specifically required for the expression of γ-crystallins (10Nishiguchi S. Wood H. Kondoh H. Lovell-Badge R. Episkopou V.

Prox-1 and Sox-1 responsive elements are also present in the γF-crystallin promoter region (9Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lengler J. Krausz E. Tomarev S. Prescott A. Quinlan R.A. Graw J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 515-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that Prox-1 and Six-3 act antagonistically to regulate the γF-crystallin promoter (12Lengler J. Krausz E. Tomarev S. Prescott A. Quinlan R.A. Graw J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 515-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet known how c-Maf, Prox-1, and Sox-1 interact with each other to regulate crystallin gene expression. It is also not known how these transcription factors specify the remarkably high levels of crystallin gene expression seen in lens cells. CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300 are well known transcriptional co-activators that have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (14Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar,15Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). They interact with many transcription factors and are required for cell differentiation and tissue development (16Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CBP/p300 can be recruited to promoters by direct interaction with DNA-binding transcription factors or as components of large complexes containing other cofactors such as P/CAF, SRC-1, and the ACTR/p/CIP group of proteins (17Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravati D. Nash A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 18Torchia Y. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). In previous studies we showed that inhibition of CBP/p300 activity in vivo (by expression of adenoviral E1A proteins in the lens of transgenic mice) resulted in inhibition of fiber cell differentiation and loss of β- and γ-crystallin gene expression (19Chen Q. Ash J.D. Branton P. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a cell culture system to investigate the possibility that CBP and/or p300 may interact directly with the transcription factors that regulate crystallin gene expression. We generated three crystallin promoter-luciferase reporters (αA, βB2, and γF), as well as a MARE-TK-luciferase reporter, and transfected COS-1 and human lens epithelial cells (HLEC-B3) with each reporter and with plasmids encoding c-Maf, Prox-1, and/or Sox-1 in the presence or absence of CBP or p300. Our results indicate that the crystallin promoters are synergistically co-activated by c-Maf·CBP and c-Maf·p300 complexes. CBP and p300 bind directly to c-Maf and co-activation is dependent upon HAT activity. We also demonstrate that Prox-1 can enhance, and Sox-1 can inhibit, this co-activation. Thus, lens-specific transcription factors interact with CBP and/or p300 to provide differential regulation of individual crystallin gene expression. A 624-bp βB2-crystallin promoter (−614/+10) and a 1367-bp (−1357/+10) γF-crystallin promoter were amplified from mouse genomic DNA using primers 5′-ATAGAACCCAGGACCACCAG/5′-GAGTGCCGTGAAGCCAGGCT for βB2-crystallin and 5′-GCCCCACCTGCAACAAACAAC/5′-GGCAGGTCAGATGGGATGGTG for γF-crystallin (20Chambers C.

For the mammalian two-hybrid assays, full-length human p300 or domains of p300 were cloned into pCMX-Gal4-N using restriction digests or PCR amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase to generate the required DNA fragments. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For the c-Maf-HAT construct, primers 5′-TTAGGTACCGCTTCAGAACTGGCAATGAAC and 5′-GCGGAATTCCATGAAAAATTCGGGAGAGG were used to amplify the c-maf coding sequence without the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with Asp718/EcoRI and cloned into the pCMX-D vector. The p300 HAT domain (amino acids 1190–1970) was amplified using primers 5′-GCGGAATTCACTTATTACAGTTACCAGAACAGGand 5′-CTCGAGTCGACCAGGTGGGTTCATACCCATGGG. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI/SalI and ligated in-frame to the 3′ end of c-maf. A start codon followed by two “Myc” tag sequences (EQKLISEEDL) was placed in-frame and upstream from c-Maf, Prox-1, or Sox-1 coding sequences in the pSG5 (Stratagene) vector. For the vector pSG5-p300-F2, two “FLAG” tag sequences (DYKDDDDK) followed by a stop codon were placed in-frame and downstream from the human p300 cDNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 1–2378. The control plasmids pCMX-β-gal and TK-growth hormone have been described elsewhere (23Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O.

COS-1 and HLEC-B3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 °C before transfection. For transient transfections, 200 ng of a luciferase reporter were co-transfected with 50 ng of pCMX-βgal control plasmid plus 20–320 ng of one or more of the transcripition factor plasmids per well of a 24-well tissue culture dish unless otherwise indicated. For the mammalian two-hybrid assays, 200 ng of pG5E1b-Luc reporter plasmid, 50 ng of TK-growth hormone control plasmid, and 100 ng each of the pCMX-Gal4-N and pCMX-VP16-N chimeric expression plasmids were used per well of a 24-well tissue culture dish. Plasmid DNAs were mixed with 2.5 m CaCl2and then added to BES-buffered saline. The DNA mixtures were added to the cells in 1 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After incubation for 8–12 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24–36 h prior to harvesting and assaying for luciferase activity on a Dynex MLX luminometer as described (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith X.Y. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). The β-gal activity was assayed using the Tropix β-galactosidase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix). Growth hormone secretion was assayed using the human growth hormone transient gene expression kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Nichols Institute). Luciferase expression was normalized to the β-gal or growth hormone control. Transfections were done in triplicate and were replicated with similar results in at least three independent experiments. Results are the mean ± S.D. from three individual experiments. All statistical analyses were performed with two-tailed Student'st tests using Microsoft Excel software. Data were considered to be significantly different for p < 0.05. COS-1 cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with Myc-tagged c-Maf, Prox-1, or Sox-1 plus FLAG-tagged p300 and/or full-length CBP in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were collected 36 h after transfection. Nuclear extracts were prepared following the protocol of Schrieber et al. (28Schreiber E. Mathias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). In addition, lenses from newborn FVB mice were collected and sonicated in protein lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, protease inhibitors (Mixture Tablets, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, one tablet in 15–20 ml solution), 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mmEGTA, pH 8.0), then centrifuged to harvest the supernatant. The lens lysates (2 mg) and the transfected COS-1 cell nuclear extracts (1 mg) were precleared by addition of 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (1:1 dilution in RIPA wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 67 mm NaCl). After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-p300 antibody (Sigma), anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz, A-22), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a 3-h incubation at room temperature, 50 μl of protein A- or G-agarose beads (1:1 dilution in RIPA buffer) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in RIPA buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–15% Tris-HCl), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen), followed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Maf (Santa Cruz), anti-CBP, anti-FLAG, or anti-Myc antibodies (1:1000 dilution) and detection by enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After SDS-PAGE separation, the proteins were also visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Our previous transgenic studies showed that lens-specific expression of adenoviral E1A proteins that bind to CBP/p300 causes inhibition of lens fiber cell differentiation and nearly complete loss of crystallin expression (19Chen Q. Ash J.D. Branton P. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although the lens phenotypes resembled the c-maf knockout mice (9Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of c-maf in lens fiber cells expressing the E1A transgene was not affected (19Chen Q. Ash J.D. Branton P. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that c-Maf-mediated transactivation of crystallin genes may require CBP/p300 co-activation. Previous studies have shown that Prox-1 and Sox-1, like c-maf, are expressed at early stages of lens development, and are required for specific crystallin (γ-crystallin) expression (10Nishiguchi S. Wood H. Kondoh H. Lovell-Badge R. Episkopou V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11Wigle J.T. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Oliver G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that expression of lens-specific crystallin genes might require interactions of ocular transcription factors with the co-activators CBP and p300. To test this prediction, we designed experiments to compare the abilities of c-Maf, Prox-1, and Sox-1 to transactivate crystallin promoters. c-Maf has previously been shown to transactivate the γF-crystallin promoter in a cell culture system (29Kim J.I., Li, T., Ho, I. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3781-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that c-Maf could also bind to DNA fragments from the mouse βB2- and αA-crystallin promoters (9Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putative MAREs have been identified in the mouse αA- (position −110/−98), βB2- (position −110/−98), and γF- (position −47/−35) crystallin promoters (9Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cvekl A. Kashanchi F. Sax C.M. Brady J.N. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell.

Based on these studies, we subcloned mouse αA, βB2, and γF promoter DNA fragments into the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Fig. 1) for transient transfection studies. Monkey kidney cells (COS-1) were co-transfected with each crystallin reporter (Fig. 1) and with plasmids encoding the different transcription factors. As predicted, c-Maf transactivated the three promoters in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2, A–C). Sox-1 transactivated the γF-crystallin promoter in a dose-dependent fashion, similar to c-Maf (Fig. 2 C). Sox-1 also stimulated the βB2 promoter, but less strongly than c-Maf (Fig. 2 B). Prox-1 (80 ng) stimulated the βB2- and γF-crystallin promoters only about 2-fold (Fig. 2, B and C). To determine whether these transcription factors can collaborate to transactivate crystallin promoters, co-transfections were done using 60 ng of each transcription factor. We observed cooperative transactivation using Prox-1 plus c-Maf, especially for the βB2 reporter (Fig. 2 D,lanes 5, 11, and 17) (p < 0.05). Co-expression of Sox-1 with c-Maf significantly increased γF promoter activation (Fig. 2 D,lane 18) (p < 0.001), but Sox-1 repressed c-Maf stimulation of the αA promoter (lane 6,p < 0.01). Except for activation of βB2 by c-Maf and Prox-1, the co-activation did not significantly exceed the sum of the activations by each individual transcription factor, suggesting a general absence of synergistic interaction.Figure 2Transactivation of crystallin promoters by c-Maf, Prox-1, and Sox-1. A–C, COS-1 cells were transfected with αA-, βB2-, or γF-crystallin reporters and plasmids encoding c-Maf, Prox-1, or Sox-1. Expression of c-Maf activated all three promoters. There was no significant αA promoter transactivation by Prox-1 or Sox-1 (p > 0.05) (A). Prox-1 activated βB2- and γF-crystallin promoters about 2-fold (p < 0.01) (B andC). Sox-1 significantly transactivated the γF reporter in a dose-dependent manner (C), and also activated the βB2 promoter (p < 0.05) (B).D, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with each crystallin reporter and 60 ng of the plasmids encoding c-Maf, Prox-1, and Sox-1 as indicated. Co-expression of Prox-1 and c-Maf enhanced transactivation of the three promoters (lanes 5, 11, and17) (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, and p < 0.05), especially βB2 (lane 11). Similarly, co-expression of Sox-1 with c-Maf significantly increased γF promoter activation (lane 18) (p < 0.001), but repressed αA promoter activity (lane 6) (p < 0.01). Fold activation is expressed relative to the Luc/β-gal ratio seen after co-transfection of each specific reporter (αA, βB2, or γF) with the empty pCMX-D expression vector, which was arbitrarily set at 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assay for CBP/p300 co-activation of crystallin promoter activity, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with each of the three crystallin reporters and plasmids encoding c-Maf, Prox-1, or Sox-1 in the presence or absence of CBP or p300. Although CBP or p300 alone did not stimulate any of the crystallin promoters (Fig.3, A–C, lanes 5and 6, p > 0.05), both proteins enhanced (or co-activated) c-Maf-dependent crystallin promoter activity for all three promoters (lanes 7 and8, p < 0.01). In contrast, expression of CBP or p300 did not significantly alter the promoter activation induced by Prox-1 or Sox-1 (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3,A–C). Human lens epithelial cell line B3 (HLEC-B3) was also used for transient transfection assays (Fig. 3 D). Synergistic co-activation of the αA-crystallin promoter was seen upon transfection with CBP plus c-maf (p < 0.01,lane 8). Stimulation of the promoter also occurred with c-Maf plus Prox-1 (p < 0.05, lane 5). Co-activation was minimal for the other combinations of factors. In addition, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the αA-crystallin promoter and c-maf, CBP, or p300, plus two versions of the E1A gene of adenovirus: E1AΔN (which does not bind to CBP/p300) and E1AΔCR2 (which binds to and inhibits both CBP and p300) (19Chen Q. Ash J.D. Branton P. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Expression of E1AΔCR2 completely blocked co-activation of the αA-crystallin promoter (p < 0.001, Fig.3 E, lanes 9 and 12). Since Prox-1 and c-Maf can collaborate to stimulate the βB2 promoter (Figs. 2 D and3 D), we tested the effects of Prox-1 and Sox-1 on c-Maf/CBP/p300 co-activation of this promoter (Fig.4). Prox-1 stimulated co-activation (p < 0.01, compare lanes 5 and 6to lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 4 A), whereas Sox-1 significantly inhibited CBP/p300 co-activation of c-Maf (p < 0.001) (lanes 7 and 8). To test whether these interactions required Prox-1- or Sox-1-binding sites, an artificial luciferase reporter (MARE-TK-Luc) was generated by inserting a c-Maf-binding site (TGCTGACTCAGCA) upstream of the TK promoter (Fig. 4 B). When COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the MARE-TK-Luc reporter and plasmids encoding c-Maf, Prox-1, Sox-1, and CBP or p300, we again observed stimulation of co-activation by Prox-1 (p < 0.05, Fig. 4 C, comparelanes 11 and 12 to lanes 9 and10), but inhibition by Sox-1 (p < 0.001,lanes 13 and 14). Prox-1 alone did not activate this reporter (Fig. 4 C, lane 3), indicating that Prox-1 does not co-activate by binding directly to the MARE. Instead, our data suggest that Prox-1 can be indirectly recruited to MARE by the c-Maf·CBP/p300 complex, as shown in Fig. 4 D. These results indicate, but do not prove, that c-Maf and Prox-1 may bind to CBP/p300 simultaneously. Since CBP and p300 have been shown to bind to numerous sequence-specific transcription factors (16Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether c-Maf, Prox-1, or Sox-1 can bind directly to CBP/p300 by co-immunoprecipitation. When COS-1 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged c-Maf and FLAG-tagged p300, antibodies to either Myc or FLAG were able to co-precipitate the two proteins (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). Similar results were obtained when COS-1 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged c-Maf and full-length CBP (Fig. 5 B). When COS-1 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged Prox-1 or Myc-tagged Sox-1 plus FLAG-tagged p300, the anti-FLAG antibody was able to co-precipitate Prox-1 but not Sox-1 (Fig. 5 C, bottom panel, lanes 6 and 5, respectively). To investigate whether c-Maf normally is bound to CBP/p300 in the lens, co-immunoprecipitations were performed using newborn mouse lens lysates. As shown in Fig. 5 D, anti-p300 antibody precipitated a c-Maf protein. To further analyze the binding of c-Maf and Prox-1 to p300, a mammalian two-hybrid assay was established (Fig.6). The DNA-binding domain of Gal4 was fused to full-length p300 and to several subregions of p300. At the same time, full-length c-Maf, Prox-1, and Sox-1 were linked to the transactivation domain of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16. The reporter construct (G5E1b-Luc) contains an E1b promoter cloned downstream of five copies of the Gal4-binding site and upstream from a luciferase reporter (Fig. 6 A). Since p300 alone does not transactivate this promoter, expression of the reporter requires interaction between p300 and c-Maf, Prox-1, or Sox-1 to recruit the VP16 transactivator to the vicinity of the promoter. As shown in Fig.6 B, Gal4-p300 plus VP16 (without c-Maf) slightly induced transcription (lane 3). When Gal4-p300 was co-expressed with VP16-c-Maf (lane 7), a dramatic increase in luciferase expression was obtained. Co-expression of VP16-c-Maf with Gal4-p300 (1–1235), which has the amino-terminal half of p300 fused to Gal4, was also able to increase transcriptional activity (lane 8). Co-expression of Gal4-p300 (1256–2415) with VP16-c-Maf showed minimal activation (lane 9). Subregions of p300 containing amino acids 1–150, 180–662, and 595–1068 were therefore linked to Gal4 and tested (Fig. 6 C). When Gal4-p300 (180–662) was co-expressed with VP16-c-Maf (lane 8), we observed a dramatic increase in transcriptional activity. Thus, c-Maf binds to the region"
https://openalex.org/W2141571911,"The genes for gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis are clustered in the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. In addition to genes encoding a GA-specific geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and a bifunctional ent-copalyl diphosphate/ent-kaurene synthase, the cluster contains four cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes (P450-1, -2, -3, -4). Recently it was shown that P450-4 and P450-1encode multifunctional enzymes catalyzing the three oxidation steps from ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid and the four oxidation steps from ent-kaurenoic acid to GA14, respectively. Here we describe the functional analysis of the P450-2 gene by gene disruption and by expressing the gene in a mutant that lacks the entire GA biosynthesis gene cluster. Mutants in whichP450-2 is inactivated by the insertion of a large piece of DNA accumulated GA14 and lacked biosynthetically more advanced metabolites, indicating that the gene encodes a 20-oxidase.

The fact that the GA 20-oxidase is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in G. fujikuroiand not a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase as in plants, together with the significant differences in regulation of gene expression, are further evidence for independent evolution of the GA biosynthetic pathways in plants and fungi.

Comparison of the products of the plant and fungal genes indicates important biochemical differences in GA biosynthesis between these kingdoms. For example, formation of the early hydrocarbon intermediate ent-kaurene from geranylgeranyl diphosphate requires two enzymes in plants but is catalyzed by a single bifunctional terpene cyclase in G. fujikuroi (7Tudzynski B. Kawaide H. Kamiya Y. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and a Phaeosphaeria species (8Kawaide H. Imai R. Sassa T. Kamiya Y. J. Biol.

Althoughent-kaurene oxidase, which converts ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid, is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in plants and G. fujikuroi, the enzymes encoded byGA3 in Arabidopsis thaliana and P450-4 in G. fujikuroi are highly diverged and are placed in different P450 families (6Tudzynski B. Hedden P. Carrera E. Gaskin P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3514-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that in G. fujikuroi the four steps by which ent-kaurenoic acid is converted to GA14are catalyzed by a single multifunctional cytochrome P450, encoded by P450-1 (4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This enzyme is also responsible for the formation of GA12 and for the kaurenolides and fujenoic acids, which are products of branches from the main pathway (4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the biosynthetic pathway from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate to GA12-aldehyde is the same in the fungus and in all higher plants studied so far, thereafter it differs between G. fujikuroi and plants. InG. fujikuroi, GA12-aldehyde is 3β-hydroxylated to GA14-aldehyde and then oxidized on C-7 to GA14 (main pathway) or oxidized directly on C-7 to GA12 (minor pathway) by the same multifunctional enzyme, P450-1 (Fig. 1 and Refs. 4Rojas M.C.

Phytochemistry. 2001; 56: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The products of P450-1 are then converted by oxidative removal of C-20 to GA4 and GA9, respectively. In most higher plant species, GA12, formed from ent-kaurenoic acid byent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (10Helliwell C.A. Chandler P.M. Poole A. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2065-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), is either 13-hydroxylated to GA53, which is converted to GA20 by GA 20-oxidase (13-hydroxylation pathway) or oxidized directly by 20-oxidase to GA9 (non-13-hydroxylation pathway). In plants, the removal of C-20, through which C20-GAs are converted to C19-GAs, requires the progressive oxidation of the C-20 methyl through a hydroxymethyl to an aldehyde, from which C-20 is lost as CO2 in the formation of a γ-lactone (11Kamiya Y. Takahashi N. Graebe J.E. Planta. 1986; 169: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This series of reactions is catalyzed by multifunctional 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, for which the alcohol and aldehyde intermediates are both products and substrates. For all known plant GA 20-oxidases, the main final products are C19-GAs (12Phillips A.L. Ward D.A. Uknes S. Appleford N.E.J. Lange T. Huttly A.K. Gaskin P. Graebe J.E. Hedden P.

In contrast to plant systems, the oxidation sequence at C-20 to give the C19-GAs has not been clearly established inG. fujikuroi (Fig. 1). Although fungal cultures convert GA14 to GA4 (major pathway) and GA12 to GA9 (minor pathway), it has not been possible to demonstrate the involvement of intermediates in these conversions. Potential intermediates, such as GA37, GA36, and GA13, are present in cultures, but these are not formed from GA14 when they are applied to the fungal mutant strain B1-41a, nor are they metabolized to GA4 (15Bearder J.R. MacMillan J. Phinney B.O. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1975; : 721-726Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar results are found for GA15, GA24, and GA25, the non-hydroxylated analogs of these possible intermediates. Although all GA biosynthetic steps after GA53 are catalyzed by dioxygenases in plants (1Hedden P. Kamiya Y. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 431-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 2Hedden P. Phillips A.L. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), the G. fujikuroi GA gene cluster contains no dioxygenase genes. Instead, four cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes are closely linked in the cluster, indicating that, in contrast to higher plants, the 20-oxidation might be catalyzed by a monooxygenase in the fungus. Here we report the functional analysis of one of the four P450 monooxygenase genes, P450-2, demonstrating that this gene fulfills the function of the plant 20-oxidases. The enzyme catalyzes the removal of C-20 from GA14 and GA12 to produce the C19-GAs, GA4 and GA9, respectively. In addition to the differences in enzyme character, expression of the plant and fungal GA 20-oxidase genes is regulated differently. G. fujikuroi m567, a wild-type strain from rice, was provided by the Fungal Culture Collection (Weimar, Germany). The wild-type strain IMI58289 and the GA-defective mutant strain SG139 (16Barrero A.F. Oltra J.R. Cabrera E. Reyes F. Álvarez M. Phytochemistry. 1999; 50: 1133-1140Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by E. Cerda-Olmedo and J. Avalos (University of Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain). SG139 is missing the entire GA gene cluster as demonstrated by Southern blot and PCR analysis. Escherichia colistrain Top10 (Invitrogen) was used for plasmid propagation. The gene disruption vector, pP450-2-GD, constructed by cloning a 0.9-kb internalHindIII/SalI fragment ofP450-2 from plasmid pP450-S containing a 6.7-kbSalI fragment spanning from P450-4 to the heme binding domain of P450-2 (5Tudzynski B. Hölter K. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 25: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was cloned into the vector pGPC1 (17Desjardins A.E. Gardner H.W. Weltring K.M. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1992; 9: 201-211Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) carrying the hygromycin B resistance cassette. For complementation of strain SG139 with the wild-type P450-2 gene, a 4.0-kbBamHI fragment carrying the entireP450-2 gene was cloned into pGPC1 (17Desjardins A.E. Gardner H.W. Weltring K.M. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1992; 9: 201-211Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For DNA isolation the fungal strains were grown in 100 ml of complete liquid medium optimized forFusarium spp. (18Pontecorvo G.V. Roper J.A. Hemmonns L.M. MacDonald K.D. Buften A.W.J. Adv. Genet. 1952; 5: 141-238Crossref Scopus (1604) Google Scholar) for 3 days at 28 °C on a rotary shaker set at 200 rpm. The mycelium was harvested by filtration through a sterile glass filter (G2, Schott Jena, Germany), washed with sterile distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized for 24 h. The lyophilized mycelial tissue was ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. For RNA isolation, fungal strains were grown in an optimized GA3 production medium (OPM), containing 6% sunflower oil, 0.05% (NH4)2SO4, 1.5% corn-steep solids (Sigma), and 0.1% KH2PO4. Mycelium was harvested after 15 h (growth phase) and after 3–6 days of cultivation (production phase). For study of feedback control by GAs the mycelium was cultivated in 10% ICI medium (19Geissman T.A. Verbiscar A.J. Phinney B.O. Cragg G. Phytochemistry. 1966; 5: 933-947Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar) for 4 days and then resuspended in 0% ICI with or without the addition of 1 g/liter of GA3. For analysis of GAs, fungal strains were grown in the GA production medium for 7–10 days at 28 °C on a rotary shaker (200 rpm). Cultures for metabolism studies were established in 100 ml of 100% ICI medium for 4 days at 25 °C on a rotary shaker, then subcultured into 100 ml of 40% ICI medium, and, after 5 days, into 100 ml of 10% ICI medium containing 1 mm AMO-1618 (Calbiochem). Genomic DNA was isolated from lyophilized mycelium according to Doyle and Doyle (20Doyle J.J. Doyle J.L. Focus. 1990; 12: 13-15Google Scholar). Lambda DNA from positive lambda clones was prepared according to Ref. 21Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar. Plasmid DNA was extracted using Genomed columns following the manufacturer's protocol (Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). RNA for Northern blot analysis was isolated by using the RNAgents total RNA isolation kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). After incubation with restriction endonucleases and electrophoresis, genomic or lambda DNA was transferred to Hybond N+ filters (Amersham Biosciences) (22Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled probes were prepared using the random oligomer primer method. Filters were hybridized at 65 °C in 5× Denhardt's solution containing 5% dextran sulfate (21Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Filters were washed at the hybridization temperature in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS and then 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. Northern blot hybridization was accomplished by the method of Church and Gilbert (23Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). Probing with G. fujikuroi rRNA was used as a control for RNA transfer. Preparation of protoplasts and the transformation procedure were carried out as previously described (24Tudzynski B. Mende K. Weltring K.-M. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Microbiol. 1996; 142: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For gene disruption, 107 protoplasts (100 μl) of strain IMI58289 were transformed with 10 μg of the gene disruption vector pP450-2-GD. For complementation of the mutant strain, SG139, with the intact P450-2 gene, protoplasts were transformed with 10 μg of the circular complementation vector pP450-2-GC. Transformed protoplasts were regenerated at 28 °C in a complete regeneration agar (0.7 m sucrose, 0.05% yeast extract, 0.1% (NH4)2SO4 containing 120 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Calbiochem)) for 6–7 days. Single conidial cultures were established from hygromycin B-resistant transformants and used for DNA isolation and Southern blot analysis. For analysis of GA formation, the wild-type strain and P450-2-disrupted mutants were cultivated in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 ml of OPM medium. Cultures were incubated for 7 days on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 28 °C. GA3 was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to Barendse et al. (25Barendse G.W.M. van de Werken P.H. Takahashi N. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 198: 449-455Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using a Merck HPLC system with a UV detector and a Lichrospher 100 RP18 column (5 μm; 250 × 4; Merck). GA3 ,GA4, and GA7 also were analyzed by thin layer chromatography eluted with ethyl acetate/chloroform/acetic acid (60:40:5). Extracts of culture filtrates and mycelia were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) as described previously (3Linnemannstöns P. Voss T. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2558-2564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of strains SG139 and complemented transformants were used as templates for amplification of the entireP450-2 gene. The specific primers, which were synthesized by MWG-Biotech AG, had the following sequences: P450-2-F, 5′-ATGATCACCAGCTATGCGGGTGCC-3′ and P450-2-R, 5′-ATCCAACTCAACTGACTCCCGACGC-3′. DNA amplification was performed in 50 μl mixtures using 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Red-Taq, Sigma), 50 ng/μl genomic DNA, 50 μm each dNTP, 200 nm each primer and 1×Taq buffer (Sigma). PCR was carried out for 36 cycles, each comprising 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 0.5 min of annealing at 62 °C, and 1.5 min of extension at 72 °C. The PCR product was purified using the gel extraction kit (Genomed), precipitated with 0.3m sodium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol and cloned using the pCR2.1 vector system (Invitrogen). [1,7,12,18-14C4]GA12(4.40 TBq mol−1) and [1,7,12,18-14C4]GA12-aldehyde (6.81 TBq mol−1) were prepared fromR-[2-14C]mevalonic acid (Amersham Biosciences) using a cell-free system from pumpkin endosperm, as previously described (26Graebe J.E. Hedden P. Gaskin P. MacMillan J. Phytochemistry. 1974; 13: 1433-1440Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). [14C]GA14 (6.81 TBq mol−1) was prepared from [14C]GA12-aldehyde by incubation with cultures of the P450-1 transformant SG139-T7 ofG. fujikuroi (4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). [18-2H1]GA12 was a gift from Dr. M. H. Beale (IACR-Long Ashton Research Station) and was used to prepare [2H1]GA14 by incubation with cultures of the P450-1 transformant SG139-T7 (4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). [17-14C]GA24 (1.64 TBq mol−1), [17-14C]GA15 (1.64 TBq mol−1), [17-2H]GA36, and [17-2H]GA37 were obtained from Professor L. Mander (Australian National University, Canberra, Australia). The open lactones of [14C]GA15 and [2H]GA37 were prepared by heating the respective lactones at 100 °C in 0.1 n KOH for 2 h. For incubations with radiolabelled substrates, fungal cultures of SG139 transformants were grown in 40% ICI medium for 2 days at 28 °C then harvested and the mycelia washed with 0% medium (19Geissman T.A. Verbiscar A.J. Phinney B.O. Cragg G. Phytochemistry. 1966; 5: 933-947Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mycelia were resuspended in 0% ICI, and 1-ml aliquots were transferred to 25 ml sterile flasks containing 5 ml of the same medium. The radiolabelled substrates (500 Bq/flask) were added to the cultures in methanol (10–40 μl). After incubation on an orbital shaker at 28 °C for 2 days, cultures were filtered and GAs extracted and purified as described in Ref. 4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar. HPLC analysis was made on a C18 column (Symmetry, Waters) in a Waters 600 instrument using a linear gradient from 60 to 100% methanol/H2O, pH 3.0, over 30 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Products were identified by combined GC-MS as described previously (3Linnemannstöns P. Voss T. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2558-2564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P450-2 is part of the G. fujikuroi GA biosynthesis gene cluster and was mapped to the right of P450-1 and to the left of ggs2 (5Tudzynski B. Hölter K. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 25: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig.2A). The gene (GenBankTM accession no. Y15278) contains 6 introns and encodes a cytochrome P450-like protein of 1,568 bp. To characterize the biosynthetic steps in which the gene might be involved we performed gene disruption experiments. An internal 0.9-kbHindIII/SalI fragment ending in the middle of the heme binding domain of the enzyme, was cloned into the vector pGPC1 carrying the hygromycin resistance gene. The resulting disruption vector pP450-2-GD (Fig. 2B) was transformed into the wild-type strain IMI58289. Among the 24 transformants generated, two showed no GA production. The gene disruption event was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3). Both transformants, ΔP450-2-T35 and ΔP450-2-T39, had lost the 4.0-kbBamHI wild-type band and instead produced hybridizing bands consistent with the integration of the vector into theP450-2 locus by a single crossover. Additional hybridizing bands in the transformants are due to ectopic vector integrations. Neither transformant produced GA4, GA7, or GA3, as shown by TLC and HPLC. To characterize the step in the pathway that was blocked by disruption ofP450-2, the wild-type strain IMI58289 and the transformant T35 were cultivated in 20% ICI production medium for 5 days. Extracts of the culture fluids and the mycelia were analyzed by GC-MS. The total ion current traces for the culture fluid extracts are shown in Fig. 4. The wild-type produced mainly GA3, GA13, GA7, and 7β,18-dihydroxykaurenolide, whereas the mutant ΔP450-2-T35 accumulated GA14 but later intermediates of the pathway were not detected. This result indicated that P450-2 activity was required for oxidation of GA14 at C-20, a reaction that in plants is catalyzed by dioxygenases. To confirm that P450-2 was a 20-oxidase and to define precisely the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme we transformed the GA-deficient mutant strain SG139 with the gene complementation vector pP450-2-GC containing an intact copy of P450-2 and the hygromycin resistance cassette as selection marker. Strain SG139 has lost the entire GA gene cluster and was used previously to demonstrate the functions of P450-4 (6Tudzynski B. Hedden P. Carrera E. Gaskin P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3514-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and P450-1 (4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Ten of the resulting hygromycin-resistant transformants were analyzed by PCR for correct integration of the complete P450-2 gene using primers P450-2-F and P450-2-R (see Fig. 2). Six of the transformants amplified the expected 2,500-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the size of the wild-type gene (data not shown). To confirm that the gene is expressed in the complemented transformants, Northern blot analysis was performed on some of the transformants as well as on the wild-type and mutant strain SG139 (Fig. 5A).P450–2 was expressed in the wild type as well as in transformants T1, T3, T6, and T17 but was not expressed in the recipient strain SG139 or in T4, even though this transformant produced a PCR product of the correct size. Transformants T1, T6, and T17 were used for further expression and metabolism studies. We showed previously that the genes encoding CPS/KS (ent-kaurene synthase), P450-1 (GA14 synthase), and P450-4 (ent-kaurene oxidase) are expressed only in GA production conditions (low nitrogen) (4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Tudzynski B. Hölter K. Fungal Genet.

Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3514-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether P450-2 is co-regulated with these genes, the wild type was grown for 15, 24, 38, 48, and 60 h in 10 and 100% ICI medium containing 0.5 and 5.0 g/liter NH4NO3, respectively. Northern blot analysis of total RNA revealed a single band of ∼1.8 kb only in 10% ICI medium clearly demonstrating strong nitrogen repression of gene expression. The P450-2 transcript was just detectable at 24 h and increased in abundance with culture time (Fig. 5B). Its expression pattern corresponded closely to that of P450-4 (Fig. 5B) and four other genes in the GA cluster (4Rojas M.C. Hedden P. Gaskin P. Tudzynski B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5838-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Tudzynski B. Hölter K. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 25: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In higher plants GA 20-oxidases are key regulatory enzymes for GA biosynthesis, and their expression is under negative feedback control by bioactive GAs. However, addition of 1 g/liter GA3, the final product of GA biosynthesis in G. fujikuroi, to cultures of the wild-type strain did not reduce P450-2 transcript abundance (Fig.5C), suggesting its expression is not under feedback control. [14C]GA14 and [14C]GA12 were both metabolized efficiently by the three P450-2 transformants, SG139-T1, -T6, and -T17, grown under GA-producing conditions. Complete conversion of [14C]GA14 to [14C]GA4 was demonstrated by HPLC and GC-MS, whereas [14C]GA12 was converted to [14C]GA9 and smaller amounts of [14C]GA25, the tricarboxylic acid product (Fig. 6 and Table I). In some incubations with [14C]GA12, [14C]GA916,17-dihydrodiol was also detected (Table I). The dihydrodiol was apparently a product of the P450-2 monooxygenase because [14C]GA9 was not transformed when incubated with the recipient strain SG139. Incubations of [14C]GA12 or [14C]GA14 with SG139 also gave no conversion of these precursors (Fig. 6), whereas the wild-type strain IMI58289 converted these substrates to mainly [14C]GA9plus [14C]GA25 (Fig. 6, retention time 20 and 17 min, respectively), and [14C]GA3 (Fig. 6, retention time, 7 min), respectively.Table IGC-MS identification of products from incubations of isotopically labelled GA12, GA14 and C-20 alcohol and aldehyde GAs with SG139 P450–2 transformantsTransformantSubstrateProducts (% relative amount)1-aIn the case of14C-labeled substrates, the % relative abundance of each product was based on the recovered radioactivity after HPLC separation.

https://openalex.org/W1991746997,"The Gal4p family of yeast zinc cluster proteins comprises over 50 members that are putative transcriptional regulators. For example, Pdr1p and Pdr3p activate multidrug resistance genes by binding to pleiotropic drug response elements (PDREs) found in promoters of target genes such as PDR5, encoding a drug efflux pump involved in resistance to cycloheximide. However, the role of many zinc cluster proteins is unknown. We tested a panel of strains carrying deletions of zinc cluster genes in the presence of various drugs. One deletion strain (Δrdr1) was resistant to cycloheximide, whereas eight strains showed sensitivity to the antifungal ketoconazole or cycloheximide. Unnamed zinc cluster genes identified in our screen were called RDS for regulators of drug sensitivity. RNA levels of multidrug resistance genes such asPDR16, SNQ2, and PDR5 were decreased in many deletion strains. For example, cycloheximide sensitivity of a Δstb5 strain was correlated with decreased RNA levels and promoter activity of the PDR5gene. We tested if activation of PDR5 is mediated via a PDRE by inserting this DNA element in front of a minimal promoter linked to the lacZ gene. Strikingly, activity of the reporter was decreased in a Δstb5 strain. The purified DNA binding domain of Stb5p bound to a PDRE in vitro. Mutations in the PDRE known to affect binding of Pdr1p/Pdr3p showed similar effects when assayed with Stb5p. These results strongly suggest that Stb5p is a transcriptional activator of multidrug resistance genes.

The ability of cells to become resistant to toxic compounds such as drugs is of major importance because the treatment of many diseases is hampered by the ability of either the body's own malignant cells or of foreign pathogenic organisms to develop PDR and thereby become resistant to drugs. Saccharomyces cerevisiaehas been widely used to study PDR, allowing us to gain insight into the mechanisms behind PDR in pathogenic fungi and in higher eukaryotes. There are mainly three types of proteins involved in PDR: 1) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, 2) major facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins, and 3) transcription factors. ABC proteins are found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans and are involved in many important processes in the cell (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar, 2Michaelis S. Berkower C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 291-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most ABC proteins are ATP-powered membrane translocators, although some function as ion channels, channel regulators, receptors, proteases, and sensing proteins (3Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). ABC proteins are able to translocate a wide variety of compounds including ions, heavy metals, anticancer drugs, steroids, mycotoxins, antibiotics, and whole proteins (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar, 4Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 5Kuchler K. Thorner J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 499-514PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dean M. Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Two well characterized ABC transporters, Pdr5p and Snq2p, confer PDR. They are functional homologues of mammalian P-glycoprotein (7Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In contrast to ABC proteins, MFS members do not use ATP. Instead, proton-motive force is used to transport substrates across the membrane. Atr1p is one member of the MFS shown to be involved in drug resistance (9Gompel-Klein P. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Various transcription factors have been shown to regulate the expression of genes encoding ABC or MFS proteins (10Koloczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). There are two major families of transcription factors involved in PDR: 1) the bZip protein family (Yap family), and 2) zinc cluster proteins. Yap1p is the best characterized member of the bZip family and is an important regulator in the stress response (11Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

Thireos G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4036-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Yap1p regulates the expression of the ABC transporter, Ycf1p (14Wemmie J.A. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another class of transcription factors involved in PDR is composed of zinc cluster or binuclear zinc cluster proteins. They form a family of transcription factors found exclusively in fungi. Zinc cluster proteins are characterized by a zinc finger, which contains the Zn(II)2Cys6 (or C6 zinc) binuclear cluster DNA-binding motif with the consensus sequence of CysX2CysX6CysX5–12CysX2CysX6–8Cys. The cysteines mediate the binding of two zinc atoms, which are necessary for the zinc finger to bind DNA (15Pan T. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Gardner K.H. Pan T. Narula S. Rivera E. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11292-11302Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Many zinc cluster proteins bind DNA as homodimers to recognition sites that usually fall within three types: inverted, direct, and everted repeats (17Schwabe J.W. Rhodes D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These proteins have been shown to be involved in various processes in the cell including regulation of primary and secondary metabolism, drug resistance, and meiotic development (18Todd R.B. Andrianopoulos A. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 388-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), e.g. Gal4p is involved in the activation of genes that encode enzymes for galactose metabolism (19Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), whereas Hap1p activates genes involved in respiration (20Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21Creusot F. Verdiere J. Gaisne M. Slonimski P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two zinc cluster proteins, Pdr1p and Pdr3p, have been shown to positively control the expression of genes involved in multidrug resistance (10Koloczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Target genes of Pdr1p and Pdr3p include PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1 encoding ABC transporters, as well as HXT9 and HXT11 encoding hexose transporters which belong to the MFS family (22Decottignies A. Lambert L. Catty P. Degand H. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the ABC transporters renders yeast resistant to drugs. However, the overexpression of the hexose transporters leads to drug sensitivity. Even though Pdr1p and Pdr3p recognize the same pleiotropic drug response element (PDRE), with Pdr3p binding an everted repeat CCGCGG, they have different roles (26Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The PDR3 promoter contains two PDREs, allowing for autoregulation (26Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Another zinc cluster protein, Yrr1p, is implicated in PDR, e.g. Yrr1p has been shown to regulate the expression of SNQ2 (28Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The yeast genome contains 55 genes encoding putative zinc cluster proteins (for a complete list, see Refs. 29Akache B., Wu, K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 30Angus-Hill M.L. Schlichter A. Roberts D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cairns B.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the function of many of these putative zinc cluster proteins is unknown. A phenotypic analysis was carried out on 33 genes encoding yeast zinc cluster proteins to better understand their role (29Akache B., Wu, K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, we have shown that deletion of eight different zinc cluster genes impairs growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. In this study, we have extended our previous analysis by assaying the growth of these deletion strains in the presence of various drugs. Our results show that nine of these deletion strains are either resistant or sensitive to at least one drug. The wild-type strain used was BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0; Ref. 31Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E., Li, J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

Deletions for a number of strains were verified by Southern blot analysis (see list below). Research Genetics strain 11677 does not carry a deletion of the ORFYOR380W. 2K. Hellauer and B.

Plasmid pFA6 (34Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P.

Briefly, the reporters are low copy plasmids (ARSCEN) containing aURA3 marker. The PDR5 and SNQ2reporters contain 1000 and 700 bp of sequences upstream of the ATG, respectively. Reporters PDRE3-lacZ, PDRE3A-lacZ, and PDRE3B-lacZ are high copy (2-μm) URA3-marked plasmids containing a single Pdr1/Pdr3p binding site inserted upstream of minimal CYC1promoter driving lacZ transcription (36Hellauer K.

Research Genetics deletion strain 11677 (YOR380W) did not give a band of the expected size with a probe corresponding to the promoter region of the YOR380Wgene (data not shown; see also “Strains”). A DNA fragment encoding the DNA-binding domain of Stb5p (amino acids 1–163) was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides CGGGATCCATGGATGGTCCCAATTTTGC and GGAATTCCTTGGTACGTCTTGGGGCTC and genomic DNA (isolated from strain YPH499; Ref. 38Sikorski R.S.

The DNA-binding domains of Stb5 and Pdr3p fused to GST were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (27Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell.

Our study focused on 32 members of the Gal4p family of yeast zinc cluster proteins (Table I). Many members are putative proteins of unknown function. We determined whether these zinc cluster genes play a role in multidrug resistance by testing the ability of strains carrying deletions of these genes to grow in the presence of six different drugs: cycloheximide, ketoconazole, chloramphenicol, 4-NQO, rhodamine 6-G, and oligomycin. The mode of action of these drugs is listed in Table II. Wild-type and deletion strains were serially diluted and spotted on plates containing the drugs and grown for the time indicated in Table II. As expected (28Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), deletion ofYRR1 resulted in hypersensitivity to the mutagen 4-NQO (Table III). However, none of the 31 other strains showed altered sensitivity to 4-NQO, oligomycin, rhodamine 6-G, and chloramphenicol (data not shown).Table IGenes tested in this studySystematic nameGeneFunctionRef.YBL066CSEF1Suppressor of essential function(55Groom K.R.

Open table in a new tab –, no phenotype. When assayed with the antifungal ketoconazole or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, nine strains demonstrated a clear phenotype with at least one drug (Table III). Three of the genes deleted were not named previously. Because they potentially encode transcriptional regulators and show altered drug sensitivity, we named themRDS1–RSD3 (for regulator of drugsensitivity; see Tables II and III). Two strains (Δupc2 and Δrds2) were hypersensitive to ketoconazole (Fig. 1). Deletion ofRDS3 resulted in a slightly decreased resistance, as seen from the reduced number of colonies at low cell concentration. The Δrds3 strain was also hypersensitive to cycloheximide (see below). Moreover, seven strains revealed a phenotype when grown in the presence of cycloheximide. One strain (Δrdr1) was resistant to that drug. The same phenotype was observed whenRDR1 was deleted in the strain FY73 (36Hellauer K. Akache B. MacPherson S. Sirard E. Turcotte B. J. Biol.

Strains carrying deletions of YIL130W or YKL222C were slightly resistant to cycloheximide (data not shown). Because of the subtle phenotype observed with these two genes, they were not scored as regulators of drug sensitivity. Six other deletion strains showed sensitivity to cycloheximide (Fig. 2). For example, deletion of STB5 or RDS3 abolished growth on plates containing cycloheximide, whereas normal growth was observed in the absence of the drug when compared with the wild-type strain. Two strains showed phenotypes on more than one drug: strain Δyrr1 was sensitive to 4-NQO and cycloheximide, whereas Δrds3 was sensitive to both ketoconazole and cycloheximide. In summary, our study has assigned new drug sensitivity phenotypes for nine genes encoding zinc cluster proteins.FIG. 2Deletion of various genes encoding zinc cluster proteins results in altered sensitivity to cycloheximide.Wild-type or deletion strains were grown overnight in YPD. Cells were spun down, resuspended in water, and serially diluted (leftto right: ∼1.25 × 104, 2.5 × 103, 5 × 102, and 1 × 102 cells). Cells were then spotted on YPD plates either with (lower panel) or without (upper panel) cycloheximide. Gene deletions are indicated on theright part of the figure. WT, wild-type strain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Deletion strains that showed a phenotype most probably lack a transcriptional regulator. Thus, we tested whether these strains had altered expression of selected genes involved in multidrug resistance. RNA was isolated from the wild-type strain and the deletion strains that showed altered drug sensitivity and probed for PDR5, SNQ2, and PDR16 mRNAs (Fig.3). As stated above, SNQ2 and PDR5 encode multidrug transporters. For example, Pdr5p has been shown to be a major mediator of cycloheximide resistance (40Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr.

As expected (28Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the level of SNQ2 mRNA was reduced in cells lacking YRR1 (Fig. 3, lane 8). Interestingly, SNQ2 RNA was also reduced in aΔstb5 strain (Fig. 3, lane 11). However, actin level was also reduced with that strain. We doubled the amount ofΔstb5 RNA and repeated the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3, lanes 12 and 13). Clearly, the levels ofSNQ2 RNA were reduced in a Δstb5 strain, whereas signals with an actin probe were similar in wild-type and deletion strains. The levels of PDR16 mRNA were reduced in Δecm22, Δrds2, Δhal9, and Δstb5 strains as compared with the wild-type strain (Fig.3, compare lanes 4, 6, 7, and 11 with lane 1). PDR5 mRNA levels were reduced in many strains, but the decrease was not as severe as with PDR16 and SNQ2. Strains Δecm22and Δstb5 had the lowest amount of PDR5mRNA when compared with a wild-type strain, whereas a decrease was also observed in Δrds1, Δrds2, Δhal9, Δupc2, and Δrds3 strains. No major changes in PDR5, PDR16, and SNQ2 mRNAs were observed with deletion of ORFsYKL22C and YIL130W, in agreement with their slight resistance to cycloheximide. All the drug-sensitive strains had lower mRNA levels for either one or more of the tested RNAs. Thus, the observed phenotypes correlate with the reduced amount of the tested mRNAs. Strikingly, a strain deleted of STB5 is sensitive to cycloheximide and has reduced mRNA levels for PDR5(as well as SNQ2 and PDR16). Our data strongly suggest that Stb5p is an additional regulator of genes encoding ABC transporters. To determine whether changes in PDR5 and SNQ2mRNA levels are because of altered promoter activity, we transformed PDR5 and SNQ2 lacZreporters into the wild-type and the deletion strains (Table IV). Only a slightly reduced activity of the SNQ2 reporter was observed with the Δyrr1strain, even though SNQ2 mRNA levels were drastically reduced in the absence of Yrr1p. Similar results were obtained in another study (43Cui Z.F. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We do not know the reason for the discrepancy between the Northern blot analysis and the reporter assay. The activity of the PDR5 reporter in strain Δhal9 was decreased ∼2-fold, whereas the activity of the SNQ2reporter was slightly decreased (Table IV). Deletion of STB5decreased activity of the PDR5 and SNQ2 reporters 2- and 7-fold, respectively. In addition, deletion of RDS3decreased activity of the SNQ2 and PDR5 promoters 2- and 3-fold, respectively.Table IVAc"

The term amoeboflagellate is used to describe amoebae that can transform into flagellates. N. fowleri is a facultative parasite capable of carrying out its full life-cycle without the intervention of a parasitic stage (1Rodriguez-Zaragoza S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Portals of entry for human infection are the nasal passages and olfactory neuroepithelium during swimming and bathing in hot baths or hot springs. The invasive stage ofN. fowleri is primarily the amoebic form. After traveling along the olfactory nerves to the brain they invade the olfactory bulbs and then spread to the more posterior regions of the brain (2John D.T. Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 1982; 36: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,3Ma P. Visvesvara G.S. Martinez A.J. Theodore F.H. Daggett P.M. Sawyer T.K. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12: 490-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Within the brain they provoke inflammation and cause extensive destruction of tissue (4Carter R.F. J. Pathol. 1970; 100: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This rapidly fatal infection, known as “primary amoebic meningoencephalitis” usually results in death within 72 h after the onset of symptoms. The molecular mechanism of invasion and pathogenesis of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis are still unclear. In vitro, intact amoebae (5Marciano-Cabral F. Zoghby K.L. Bradley S.G. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as well as cell-free extracts thereof (6Fulford D.E. Marciano-Cabral F. J.

Among several factors to which pathogenicity has been attributed such as phospholipases (7Fulford D.E. Bradley S.G. Marciano-Cabral F. J.

Huizinga H. Bouvier J. McKerrow J. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 78: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the most attractive candidate for mediating the enormous tissue-destructive capacity is a protein that has been described more than a decade ago (12Young J.D. Lowrey D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1077-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to form pores in target cell membranes. It was found that the pore-forming activity was membrane-bound, however, the responsible protein was never characterized at the molecular level. This study was directed at isolating the pore-forming protein of N. fowleri, subsequently identifying the gene that is coding for this factor and determining its primary structure. We purified two polypeptides that display potent pore-forming activity and that were found after their biochemical and molecular characterization to be glycoproteins each contained in a multipeptide precursor structure. These polypeptides were found to kill prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic target cells. A highly virulent strain of N. fowleri(ATCC 30894), LEEmp, was used in this investigation. Samples of brain tissue from infected mice containing amoebae were cultured at 37 °C in Oxoid medium supplemented with serum and hemin to obtain amoebae. Amoebae were cultured axenically for 4 days prior to use (13Marciano-Cabral F. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 114-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly harvested and washed amoebae were extracted overnight with 5 volumes of 10% acetic acid. The extract was centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant was passed through a C18 12-cc (2 g) Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA),1 and adsorbed material was stepwise eluted with 30–100% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA (10 ml for each 10%-step). Proteins eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA were lyophilized, resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and loaded onto a Mono S HR5/5 cation exchange column (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with the same buffer. Adsorbed material was eluted by washing the column with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (5 ml), and by the use of a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient (25 ml). Pore-forming material representing naegleriapore A was eluted with 260 mm NaCl. After lyophilization of the active fractions, proteins were redissolved in 0.1% TFA and subsequently subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a C3 PRP-3 column (Hamilton) connected to a 130A separation system (Applied Biosystems) and equilibrated with 0.1% TFA. The column was washed with 0.1% TFA (3 min), and peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–45% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA for 45 min and at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Naegleriapore A was eluted with 48% acetonitrile from the column. Proteins eluted with 60–70% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA from the initial Sep-Pak cartridge were directly applied to reversed-phase HPLC as described above. Naegleriapore B was eluted with 52% acetonitrile from the HPLC column. Tricine-SDS-PAGE was performed according to Schägger and von Jagow (14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequencing, naegleriapores purified by reverse-phase HPLC were analyzed using a gas-phase protein sequencer (model 437 A, Applied Biosystems). The method applied did not allow the detection of cysteine residues. The concentration of purified peptides was determined by measuring absorbance at 214 nm; the extinction coefficients were calculated using the respective sequence information (15Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Specific DNA fragments for each isoform were amplified from a cDNA library of N. fowleri using degenerate sense and antisense oligonucleotides deduced from the respective N-terminal amino acid sequence of naegleriapore A (sense: 5′-GATGC(A/T)GAATGTGAAATTG-3′; antisense: 5′-C(T/C)TTTTG(A/C)ATTTC(A/T)GCTTG-3′) and naegleriapore B (sense: 5′-GG(A/T)TGTGAAATTTGTGAATGG-3′; antisense: 5′-CAAAC(A/C)AT(A/T)GCTGGTGGTTC-3′). The λZAP cDNA library from N. fowleri was constructed according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Stratagene), and its screening with the radiolabeled probes was performed as described previously (16Tannich E. Scholze H. Nickel R. Horstmann R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4798-4803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridizing phages were isolated, the plasmids were released according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequences were determined from both strands. For primer extension experiments, the oligonucleotides 5′-CAGTGTTATTCTTTGGGCAC-3′ for naegleriapore A and 5′-CAATTTGTGGCTTGGTC-3′ for naegleriapore B were used. The nucleotide sequence of the extension product was determined according to the anchored PCR technique (17Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). Genomic fragments were amplified from genomic DNA of N. fowleri using oligonucleotide primers according to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding cDNA sequences and sequenced on both strands. Southern and Northern blotting were performed according to published procedures (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); hybridization and washing conditions were described previously (19Nickel R. Jacobs T. Leippe M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Peptides (1 μg) were deglycosylated with 10 units of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer, Mannheim) at 37 °C overnight according to the manufacturer's instruction. On Tricine-SDS-PAGE, the mobility of deglycosylated peptides was higher than that of native peptides. After blotting onto the nitrocellulose membrane, the deglycosylated and native peptides were analyzed using a glycan detection assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim). After deglycosylation samples were dialyzed against 5% acetic acid, vacuum-dried, solubilized in 0.1% TFA, and mixed with the same volume of saturatedtrans-sinapinic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA as UV-absorbing matrix. About 10 μl of the samples was spotted onto a stainless steel probe tip and dried at room temperature. Measurements were performed using a Bruker Relex MALDI-TOF. Ions were formed by laser desorption at 337 nm using an N2 laser. Spectra were recorded with an acceleration voltage of 35 kV in the linear mode. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) and carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes (Sigma Chemical Co.) as external standards. Antibodies against naegleriapore A and B were raised in chickens by injecting purified proteins subcutaneously. Antibodies were purified from egg yolk according to the water dilution method (20Akita E.M. Nakai S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and development of the blots were carried out as described (21Jacobs T. Bruchhaus I. Dandekar T. Tannich E. Leippe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Amoebae were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, and rendered permeable by 0.05% saponin (Sigma) in 4.5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 147 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, pH 7.4, 320 mosmol kg−1 (PBS-A). After blocking with 2% fetal calf serum in PBS-A, the cells were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min with anti-naegleriapore A or anti-naegleriapore B. As a control, amoebae were also incubated with the respective preimmune antibodies. After several washes with PBS-A, the amoebae were incubated with dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein (DTAF)-conjugated anti-chicken IgY from rabbit (Dianova) at 20 °C for 30 min in the dark and washed carefully with PBS-A. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml), and samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy with the Leica TCS NT confocal laser scanning system in combination with a Leica DMR microscope. Amoebapore A was purified fromEntamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS as described previously (22Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Magainin I and cecropin A and B were purchased from Sigma. Pore-forming activity of samples was determined by measuring fluorometrically the dissipation of a valinomycin-induced membrane potential in liposomes (23Leippe M. Ebel S. Schoenberger O.L. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model LS 50B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 620 and 670 nm, respectively. Pore-forming activity was measured as the initial change in fluorescence intensity over time after adding the sample. One unit of activity was defined as a fluorescence increase to 5% of the pre-valinomycin intensity in 1 min at 25 °C. The bacterial strains used wereBacillus subtilis (strain 60015) (22Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli K-12 D31 (24Boman H.G. Nilsson-Faye I. Paul K. Rasmuson T., Jr. Infect. Immun. 1974; 10: 136-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and subsequently inoculated in LB medium for growth to mid-logarithmic phase. After centrifugation, bacteria were washed twice with and resuspended in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 25 mm NaCl. A 96-well microtiterplate (Greiner) was precoated with 0.1% BSA for 15 min prior its use in the assay. Peptides in 0.01% TFA were serially diluted 2-fold in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 25 mm NaCl. 1 × 105 bacteria (25 μl) were incubated with the diluted peptides (25 μl), and 2 μm of the fluorescent dye Sytox green (50 μl, in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 25 mm NaCl) (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 1 h. Perturbation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane allows the dye to cross this membrane and to intercalate with the DNA. When excited at 495 nm the binding of the dye to DNA resulted in an increase of emitted fluorescence at 538 nm, which was measured in a fluoroscan II microtiterplate reader (Labsystems). Antibacterial activity of the peptides was expressed as the percentage of permeabilized bacteria. For maximum permeabilization of the bacteria (100% value), cells were incubated with 70% ethanol for 5 min. Jurkat T cells were maintained at a density of 1–6 × 105 per ml in suspension cultures with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were washed with and suspended in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl before used in the assay. A 96-well microtiterplate was precoated with 0.1% BSA before use. Peptides in 0.01% TFA were 2-fold serial diluted in 20 mmMES, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl. The diluted peptides (50 μl) were then incubated with 5 × 104 Jurkat cells in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, including 20% Alamar Blue (50 μl) (Alamar Bioscience, Sacramento, CA) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 1 h. For maximum lysis (100% value) Jurkat cells were incubated with Alamar Blue in 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl and for minimum lysis (0% value) in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 150 mmNaCl. Viable cells metabolized the dye Alamar Blue resulting in an increase of fluorescence by excitation/emission at 538/590 nm. Cytotoxic activity was calculated as follows: % cytotoxicity = 100 × (0% value − experimental value/0% value − 100% value). We purified two polypeptides with pore-forming activity from acid extracts of N. fowleri by a combination of hydrophobic interaction and cation exchange chromatography. Final purification was achieved by reverse-phase HPLC. The purification yielded apparently homogeneous material with molecular masses of 10 and 13 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). The purified polypeptides named naegleriapore A and B, respectively, were subjected to N-terminal sequencing, resulting in a single amino acid sequence up to residue 34 (DAEXEIXKFVIQQVEAFIESXHSQAEIQKELNKL) for naegleriapore A and up to residue 77 (SVIGXEIXEWLVATAEGFVXKTKPQIEQELLQICAKLGPYEQIXDQLVLMELPDIIDQIIAKEPPAIVXSQVKIXXG) for naegleriapore B confirming the purity of the peptides. Using degenerate primers, specific DNA fragments of 90 and 197 bp were amplified representing naegleriapore A and B, respectively. Screening of a cDNA library ofN. fowleri and subsequent primer extension experiments resulted in the complete cDNA sequences. The cDNAs for naegleriapores A and B contain a short 5′-untranslated region of 37 and 36 bp, an open-reading frame of 921 and 1452 bp, followed by a short 3′-untranslated region of 31 and 24 bp, respectively. Northern blot analyses confirmed a single transcript for naegleriapore A and B of 1.0 and 1.5 kb, respectively, which corresponded to the estimated size of the complete precursor mRNA of each isoform, and Southern blot analyses indicated that each naegleriapore precursor is encoded by a single copy gene (Fig. 2). The size of the cDNAs indicated that the pore-forming polypeptides derive from substantially larger precursor molecules. Deduction of amino acid sequences of 308- and 486-amino acid residues revealed that both precursor proteins start with a sequence, which has the characteristics of a typical signal peptide. The putative signal peptide is followed by several elements, which all are characterized by a virtually invariant motif of six cysteine residues within their primary structures and which are connected by short intervening sequences without cysteine residues. This cysteine residue motif is known from other membrane-active polypeptides defined as the protein family of saposin-like proteins (SAPLIPs) (25Munford R.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SAPLIP motif is found three times in the precursor of naegleriapore A and five times in that of naegleriapore B. The isolated pore-forming peptides naegleriapore A and naegleriapore B represent the second and the first SAPLIP element within their corresponding precursor, respectively (Fig.3). Given that each SAPLIP element starts with four residues preceding the first cysteine residue and ends with the sixth cysteine residue of the motif, a sequence identity of 19 to 31% was observed between the SAPLIP domains.Figure 3Alignment of amino acid sequences of the SAPLIP elements of naegleriapore precursors with amoebapores, NK-lysin, and granulysin. Disulfide bonds are outlined as connecting horizontal lines between the six conserved cysteine residues (shaded in gray). The arrowindicates the site of post-translational processing at the C terminus of granulysin. N-terminal sequences determined experimentally wereboxed. Shown also is a schematic presentation of the precursor molecules of naegleriapores. SAPLIP elements (gray boxes) within the precursor molecules are interrupted by spacer regions (dark gray boxes). Those elements representing the purified peptides naegleriapore A and B are the light boxesin the respective precursor molecule. Signal peptides of the precursors are shown in black, and the N-glycosylation sites are marked Y.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequencing of the genes coding for naegleriapore A and B, respectively, amplified from genomic DNA of N. fowleri revealed that the sequences are identical to the respective cDNA except that the genomic sequences are interrupted by introns. The gene coding for the naegleriapore A precursor contains three introns of 97, 69, and 47 bp in size, whereas the gene coding for the precursor of naegleriapore B contain a single intron of 316 bp. Three introns share the same 5′-donor splicing site (5′-GTAAGT-3′) with the exception of the first intron of the naegleriapore A precursor, which is slightly modified to 5′-GTACGT-3′. At the 3′-acceptor site a consensus sequence was not identified. PutativeN-glycosylation sites within the amino acid sequences of the mature pore-forming peptides and the finding that the molecular mass of purified naegleriapores observed upon SDS-PAGE exceeded the mass of one SAPLIP element prompted us to analyze whether the native peptides are glycosylated. Both peptides were indeed reactive in a glycan detection assay (Fig. 4 A). After digestion with N-glycosidase F both polypeptides shifted to an apparent molecular mass of ∼7 kDa and became negative in the glycan detection assay upon SDS-PAGE. MALDI-TOF analysis of the deglycosylated peptides to identify the C terminus of naegleriapore A and B gave molecular masses of 8.783 and 8.871 kDa for naegleriapore A and 8.906, 8.977, 9.057, and 9.128 kDa for naegleriapore B (Fig. 4 B). The multiple masses for each peptide can be explained by variable processing at the C terminus. The experimentally obtained molecular masses are in a good agreement with the calculated masses for both peptides provided that six half-cystines are present and that the methionine residues of the peptides were oxidized during the purification process as observed with other SAPLIPs (26Faull K.F. Whitelegge J.P. Higginson J., To, T. Johnson J. Krutchinsky A.N. Standing K.G. Waring A.J. Stevens R.L. Fluharty C.B. Fluharty A.L. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 1040-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 C). Polyclonal antibodies against the pore-forming peptides were raised in chickens and tested for their specificity by immunoblotting with purified naegleriapore A and B. Each antibody recognizes only its antigen and did not cross-react with the other naegleriapore isoform (Fig.5). These peptide-specific antibodies were then used to localize the naegleriapore isoforms inside the amoebae. As judged by indirect immunofluorescence, both peptides had a distinctly focal distribution in the cytoplasm of the cells assuming an intracellular storage in granular vesicles (Fig.6).Figure 6Cellular localization of naegleriapore A and B using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.Paraformaldehyde-fixed trophozoites of N. fowleri were permeabilized with saponin and incubated with the antibodies raised against naegleriapore A and B in chickens.

The specific pore-forming activities of naegleriapore A and B are 3.1 ± 1.7 units pmol−1 and 3.7 ± 1.3 units pmol−1, respectively. Because both peptides have been found to be glycosylated, we wanted to determine whether glycosylation is essential for activity. After treatment of purified naegleriapores with N-glycosidase F and subsequent rechromatography on reversed-phase HPLC, it became evident that naegleriapore A possesses one sugar moiety, whereas naegleriapore B has two. This is in good agreement with the potential glycosylation sites within the primary structures. Comparison of the pore-forming activity of incompletely and completely deglycosylated peptides revealed no substantial negative effect upon glycan removal: Although a slight decrease in pore-forming activity was found upon deglycosylation of naegleriapore B, the pore-forming activity of naegleriapore A increases when it was deglycosylated (Fig. 7). To strengthen the notion that pore-forming peptides are involved in the pathogenicity of the parasite, the cytotoxic activity of naegleriapore A and B were tested toward human target cells. Both peptides exert cytotoxic activity against Jurkat cells, but naegleriapore B was twice as active as naegleriapore A (Fig.8 A). Moreover, naegleriapore A displays antibacterial activity toward the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis comparable to other antibacterial peptides such as magainin I from Xenopus laevis (27Zasloff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and cecropin A and B from Hyalophora cecropia (28Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 B). In concentrations up to 10 μm, naegleriapore A was inactive against the Gram-negative representative, E. coli D31 (data not shown). Naegleriapore B did not exert any antibacterial activity in concentration up to 10 μm against the bacteria tested here. Pore-forming activities have been found in extracts of several parasites, e.g. Trypanosoma cruzi (29Andrews N.W. Abrams C.K. Slatin S.L. Griffiths G.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1077-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the proteins mediating this activity have been presented as potential pathogenicity factors of the respective parasite, only the pore-forming peptides of E. histolytica were isolated as a single active entity from crude extracts and characterized in detail at the molecular level (22Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Leippe M. Ebel S. Schoenberger O.L. Horstmann R.D.

This is the first report on the isolation and further molecular and functional characterization of pore-forming peptides of the parasitic protozoon N. fowleri, namely naegleriapores. The primary structure of naegleriapores clearly shows that the peptides belong to the distinct protein family of SAPLIPs, the members of which exert a favorable tertiary structure characterized by amphipathic helices and by six similarly located cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds (25Munford R.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Liepinsh E. Andersson M. Ruysschaert J.M. Otting G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Members of this protein family that also share antibacterial and cytolytic activities were found in such diverse organisms as protozoa, i.e. amoebapores, the aforementioned pore-forming peptides of E. histolytica (35Bruhn H. Leippe M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Leippe M. Cell. 1995; 83: 17-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Leippe M. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and Mammalia, i.e. porcine NK-lysin (38Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jornvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. et al.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and human granulysin (39Pena S.V. Hanson D.A. Carr B.A. Goralski T.J. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2680-2688PubMed Google Scholar). The SAPLIP motif is also found in nonlytic polypeptides, e.g. saposins and surfactant-associated protein B (25Munford R.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the structural similarities, all members of the SAPLIP family have in common their interaction with lipids, and it is assumed that the appearance of the SAPLIP domain is an early evolutionary event from which multiple forms with different specific functions have diverged (40Andersson M. Girard R. Cazenave P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 201-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fold of a saposin-like protein has been elucidated for porcine NK-lysin by NMR spectroscopy (34Liepinsh E. Andersson M. Ruysschaert J.M. Otting G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and yielded a bundle of five α-helices connected by three disulfide bonds to a very stabile tertiary structure. Recently, this structure has been found conserved in the plant-specific domain of plant aspartic proteinase as evidenced by crystal structure analysis (41Kervinen J. Tobin G.J. Costa J. Waugh D.S. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The latter has been named a swaposin, because in sequence alignments it became apparent that the N- and C-terminal parts of the saposin-like domain are swapped. Naegleriapores are each organized within a large precursor, and the processing of the mature peptides appears to be more complicated than it is in the case of amoebapores, the primary translation products of which each consist of one SAPLIP domain and a signal domain only. Each naegleriapore precursor contains several elements of additional naegleriapore isoforms, all revealing the structural SAPLIP motif. Besides this structural similarity to members of the SAPLIP family, the overall sequence identities of all naegleriapore isoforms to amoebapores of E. histolytica, porcine NK-lysin, and human granulysin are between 15 and 30% only. It is tempting to suggest that naegleriapores originating from free-living amoebae represent the archetype of saposin-like cytolytic and antimicrobial peptides that gave rise to the mammalian effector molecules NK-lysin and granulysin. Notably, the organization of several peptides within one precursor molecule was not only found with SAPLIPs, e.g. saposins A–D and surfactant-associated protein B (42Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); with respect to antibacterial peptides, magainins from frog skin and the apidaecins from honey bees are organized in multipreproproteins as well (45Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 46Terry A.S. Poulter L. Williams D.H. Nutkins J.C. Giovannini M.G. Moore C.H. Gibson B.W. J. Biol.

The organization in and the processing of multiple peptides from one large precursor molecule may be an efficient way to synthesize different effector molecules at once and thereby to amplify the antibacterial response. Employing alternative strategies, we detected some but not all of the SAPLIPs, which theoretically should be synthesized in parallel with the naegleriapores by the amoeba. 2R. Herbst and M. Leippe, unpublished results. Although they are apparently not true pore-forming peptides, these other SAPLIPs may well be additional elements of the antimicrobial arsenal ofNaegleria. Notably, naegleriapores are glycoproteins as opposed to being amoebapores, NK-lysin and granulysin. However, other SAPLIPs such as saposins and surfactant-associated protein B are glycosylated as well (25Munford R.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and interestingly, the glycosylation sites are situated at the same position within their primary structure as found with naegleriapores. The deglycosylation of naegleriapores A and B has no significant negative effect on their pore-forming activity. The observed increase in activity of naegleriapore A in the liposome depolarization assay may be due to an elevated hydrophobicity of the peptide upon glycan removal. Likewise, it has been shown that the presence of the sugar moieties of saposin B (48Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Martin B.M. Fluharty A.L. Hirabayashi Y. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and saposin D (49Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are not essential for activity, lipid binding, or protease resistancein vitro. The finding that both peptides are cytotoxic to human cells strengthen the assumption that these peptides are involved in tissue destruction induced by the parasite. Recently, the crucial role of pore-forming peptides in the pathogenicity of parasitic organisms has been demonstrated in E. histolytica by transfection with amoebapore A-antisense RNA. The transformed amoebae, in which amoebapore A synthesis was substantially impaired, exerted reduced cytolytic activity and did not produce liver abscesses in the animal model (50Bracha R. Nuchamowitz Y. Leippe M. Mirelman D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Naegleriapore A displays similar activity against Gram-positive bacteria as the well-known antimicrobial peptides magainin I and cecropins but is less potent than amoebapore A. Naegleriapore A did not affect the representative Gram-negative bacteria E. coli, which may be shielded by their outer membrane. Likewise, it has been shown for amoebapores that only wall-less Gram-negative bacteria were effectively lysed by these peptides (22Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Naegleriapore B does not exert any antibacterial activity here. Because only a limited number of bacteria was tested, this may indicate a divergent spectrum of target bacteria. Nonetheless, the fact that Naegleria is a facultative parasite only and feeds on bacteria suggests that the primary function of the membrane-permeabilizing polypeptides is killing of engulfed bacteria. The naegleriapores appeared to be contained in granules in which they are most likely compartmentalized together with other proteins, e.g. lysozymes, phospholipases, and proteases, that may act synergistically with the membranolytic peptides. The pathogenicity of parasites is a complex process and is proposed to involve more than one essential factor. However, in addition to the high phagocytotic activity of the amoebae, the naegleriapores may play an important role during the lethal contact of naegleriae and host cells. The discharge of cytolytic factors upon contact with host tissues may facilitate invasion into the brain. Moreover, rapid killing of effector cells of the immune system by amoebic pore-forming peptides may explain why the human defense system is, at least in several cases, unable to prevent the invasive process. Accordingly, for the fatal conversion of a free-living, bacteria-hunting amoeba into a parasite that assaults the human body, the cytolytic armament and in particular the pore-forming peptides may play a pivotal role."

We examined the conformation of β2-m amyloid fibrils by analyzing the reactivity of the disulfide bond to a reducing reagent, dithiothreitol. Although the disulfide bond in the native structure was highly protected from reduction, the disulfide bonds in the amyloid fibrils prepared at pH 2.5 were progressively reduced at pH 8.5 by 50 mmdithiothreitol. Because β2-m amyloid fibrils prepared under acidic conditions have been known to depolymerize at a neutral pH, we examined the relation between depolymerization and reduction of the disulfide bond. The results indicate that the disulfide bonds in the amyloid fibrils were protected from reduction, and the reduction occurred during depolymerization. On the other hand, the disulfide bonds of immature filaments, the thin and flexible filaments prepared under conditions of high salt at pH 2.5, were reduced at pH 8.5 more readily than those of amyloid fibrils, suggesting that the disulfide bonds are exposed to the solvent. Taken together, the disulfide bond once exposed to the solvent upon acid denaturation may be progressively buried in the interior of the amyloid fibrils during its formation. β2-Microglobulin (β2-m), a major component of dialysis-related amyloid fibrils, has an intrachain disulfide bond buried inside the native structure.

However, β2-m, existing on the surfaces of nearly all cells as the constant portion of the light chain of the major histocompatibility complex class 1 antigen (6Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar), is a normal constituent of plasma, where its concentration in adults is 1.1–2.7 mg/liter. The daily production of β2-m is in the range of 150–200 mg/day, of which 97% is excreted in the kidneys. The concentration of β2-m, therefore, is significantly increased in patients with renal failure. Blood dialysis therapy resulted in the retention of a high concentration of β2-m in the plasma. Although this retention of β2-m in the plasma appears to be a prerequisite, other factors, such as the age of the patient, the duration of dialysis, and the type of dialysis membrane used, may also be involved in the deposition of amyloid fibrils, and the mechanism of the β2-m amyloid fibril deposition is still unknown. For many proteins forming amyloid fibrils, the fibril formation is facilitated by amino acid mutations that destabilize the native state. However, β2-m is amyloidogenic in the wild-type form.

Despite the decreased stability of the mutant protein, the acidification was still necessary for amyloid fibril formation in vitro. On the other hand, complete denaturation, such as is caused by reduction of the disulfide bond, prevented the formation of rigid amyloid fibrils (17Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M.

It was reported with recombinant β2-m that conditions of low pH and high ionic strength are favorable for the formation of a flexible filamentous structure or “immature fibril” (15Kad N.M.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that the disulfide bond is important for amyloid fibril formation. A single disulfide bond buried in the molecule is highly conserved in the immunoglobulin superfamily, stabilizing the native fold of these proteins (6Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S.

(16Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 21Naiki H. Higuchi K. Nakakuki K. Takeda T. Lab.

Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the net rate of fibril extension is equal to the sum of the rates of polymerization and depolymerization. This indicates that the depolymerization of amyloid fibrils could occur under certain conditions. However, only a few studies concerning amyloid fibril depolymerization have been reported. Recently, Garcı́a-Garcı́a et al. (23Garcı́a-Garcı́a M. Gouin-Charnet A. Mourad G. Argilés A. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1997; 12: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that β2-m in mono- and dimeric forms was solubilized in vitro from prepurified β2-m amyloid fibrils and crude amyloid deposits by the action of phosphate-buffered saline alone, with no need for proteases. Yamaguchi et al. (24Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Takahashi N. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8499-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that β2-m amyloid fibrils readily depolymerized into monomeric β2-m at a neutral to basic pH. They also proposed that apolipoprotein E (apoE), a representative amyloid-associated protein, formed a stable complex with β2-m amyloid fibrils and inhibited the depolymerization of the fibrils, suggesting that apoE could enhance the deposition of amyloid fibrils in vivo. As described above, the deposition of β2-m amyloid fibrils is determined by an intricate balance of the stability of the native state and polymerization and depolymerization of amyloid fibrils. To analyze these conformational features, the reactivity of the disulfide bond, Cys25–Cys80, might be a useful probe. In this study, we focused on the reduction of the disulfide bonds in β2-m amyloid fibrils prepared at pH 2.5. We also used immature fibrils prepared under high salt conditions at pH 2.5. We employed reversed-phased high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence to monitor the reduction of disulfide bonds and the formation of amyloid fibrils, respectively. Our results indicated that the disulfide bonds of amyloid fibrils are highly protected from reduction as in β2-m in the native state, but those of the immature fibrils are not. Recombinant β2-m with three signal peptides, Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Val-, Glu-Ala-Tyr-Val-, and Val-, added at the amino-terminal Leu of intact β2-m was expressed in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and then purified as described previously (17Ohhashi Y.

In this study, we used β2-m with one additional amino acid residue. The conformational and amyloidogenic properties of this species were indistinguishable from the intact β2-m purified from patients. β2-m amyloid fibrils were formed by the fibril extension method described by Yamaguchiet al. (24Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Takahashi N. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8499-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Seed fibrils were prepared by the extension reaction of original fibrils with monomeric recombinant β2-m. The seeds used here were 6th generation from the original fibrils taken from patients. The seeds were added to yield a final concentration of 5 ng/μl in a reaction mixture containing 25 μmrecombinant β2-m, 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 2.5), and 0.1m KCl at 37 °C. Immature fibrils of β2-m were formed at 50 μm β2-m in a high salt concentration without seeds at pH 2.5 as described (18McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemstry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Depolymerization of the fibrils was carried out at pH 8.5 according to the optimal conditions reported by Yamaguchi et al. (24Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Takahashi N. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8499-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The fibrils of 25 μm β2-m were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant, the pellets were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.1 m KCl. After mixing by pipetting and vortex, the reaction tube was incubated at 25 °C. Incubation times ranged between 1 min and 24 h. In the case of immature fibrils, the pH was increased to 8.5 by the addition of 2 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). Polymerization and depolymerization were monitored by fluorometric analysis with ThT (16Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). From the reaction tube, 7.5 μl was taken and mixed with 1.5 ml of 5 μm ThT (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) in 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5), and the fluorescence of ThT was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 455 and 485 nm, respectively, with a Hitachi fluorescence spectrometer, model F-4500, at 25 °C. Fluorescence was measured immediately after the mixture was made and was averaged for the initial 5 s. The mean of the three measurements was presented. Intact β2-m was allowed to react with dithiothreitol (DTT) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.1 m KCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C both in the absence and presence of 5 m urea. We also carried out the reaction in the absence and presence of 4 mGdnHCl at 37 °C. Reduction of the disulfide bond was monitored by reversed-phase HPLC performed on a GILSON series liquid chromatograph equipped with a C4 300-Å column (3.3 × 150 mm, Waters Associates). Intact and reduced β2-m were eluted separately with a gradient beginning with solvent A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and an increasing percentage of solvent B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile). The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min. To follow the reaction of β2-m amyloid fibrils with DTT, amyloid fibrils recovered by the method described above were resuspended in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 50 mm DTT at 25 °C. From the reaction tube, 5 μl was taken and mixed with 5 μl of 2 m HCl to lower the pH and consequently to quench the reaction, and then the remaining fibrils were dissolved completely by adding 90 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. After a 30-min incubation, the sample was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC. Reaction mixtures (2.5 μl) were diluted with 25 μl of distilled water. These diluted samples were spread on carbon-coated grids, and the solution allowed to stand for 1–2 min before excess solution was removed with filter paper. After the residual solution had dried up, these grids were negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). Again, the solution on the grids was removed with filter paper and dried. These samples were examined under a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 75 kV. CD measurements were performed with a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-720, using quartz cells with a 1-mm path length. The temperature was controlled with a water-circulating cell holder at 20 °C. The data were expressed as molar residue ellipticity (θ) as described (17Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We first summarized the different conformational states of β2-m (Figs. 1 and2) as follows. Various spectroscopic results including the far-UV CD (Fig. 2) and NMR data (7Verdone G. Corazza A. Viglino P. Pettirossi F. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Andreola A. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Esposito G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) are consistent with a typical 7-stranded immunoglobulin fold as shown by x-ray crystallography (Fig.1A). The protein is substantially denatured at pH 2.5, as measured by far- and near-UV CD (15–19, Fig. 2) and NMR (17Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) spectra, although marginal residual structures were detected as indicated by the ability to bind 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (18McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemstry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions of acid denaturation (at pH 2.5 and 0.1 m KCl), amyloid fibrils were formed by the extension reaction with seed fibrils. With the preparation of fresh amyloid fibrils, extended fibrils, with a diameter of about 12–15 nm and a longitudinal periodicity, were mainly observed (Fig. 1B). The far-UV CD spectrum had a marked negative peak at ∼220 nm, suggesting an increased amount of the β-sheet content. Recent analysis of amyloid fibrils with H/2H exchange monitored by heteronuclear NMR suggested that the loop regions in the native structure were transformed to a β-sheet structure. 2Hoshino, M., Katou, H., Hagihara, Y., Hasegawa, K., Naiki, H., and Goto, Y. (2002) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9,332–336. One week after the preparation of the fibrils, we could see by EM large fibrillar clusters, which were not dispersed by dilution or mild sonication (Fig. 1C). We did not see notable changes in the CD spectrum on the aggregation of fibrils (data not shown). Another type of β2-m fibrillar structure was formed at high ionic strength and low pH (15Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemstry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 19Smith D.P. Radford S.E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These filaments, often called immature fibrils, were thin (2–5 nm) and very flexible as observed by EM (Fig. 1D) in comparison with the above amyloid fibrils. The immature fibrils were dispersed, and no aggregation of filaments was observed even after several weeks. The far-UV spectrum of the immature fibrils was different from that of the amyloid fibrils, with the negative peak shifted to a lower wavelength of around ∼215 nm. However, this is still consistent with a predominantly β-sheet structure. Because CD is an averaging technique, it was difficult to clarify whether the immature fibrils have a conformation intermediate between the acid-denatured state and amyloid fibrils. We examined the role of the immature fibrils in the formation of typical amyloid fibrils. The immature fibrils were prepared at pH 2.5 under various salt concentrations as reported by McParland et al. (18McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemstry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The immature fibrils were formed spontaneously without a lag time at 50 μm β2-m, and the amount of immature fibrils measured by ThT fluorescence was sensitively dependent on the salt concentration as reported (18McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemstry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the immature fibril formation in 0.2 m NaCl was compared with the extension reaction of the amyloid fibrils (Fig.3A). We found that freshly prepared monomer β2-m, even at concentrations as high as 100 μm, did not bind ThT, whereas both amyloid fibrils and immature fibrils did, even at a concentration as low as 5 μm (data not shown). It is noted that the ThT fluorescence intensity of amyloid fibrils prepared by the extension reaction at 25 μm β2-m and 0.1 m KCl reached a value of 200, more than several times higher than that of immature fibrils at the same concentration. This suggested that the tinctorial property of the immature fibrils is different from that of the amyloid fibrils. Another distinct feature of the immature fibrils was that the rate of formation was slower than that of the extension reaction (Fig. 3A). While the extension reaction with recombinant β2-m was completed in 2 h, the spontaneous formation of immature fibrils took 60 h to complete. To confirm whether the immature fibrils function as seeds, they were added to the monomeric β2-m solution in 0.2 m NaCl. We observed no acceleration of the fibril formation (Fig. 3A), indicating that the immature fibrils did not act as a seed. We also examined whether the immature fibrils can be converted to mature fibrils by adding the seed amyloid fibrils (Fig. 3B). There was no change in the ThT fluorescence even after incubation for up to 1 month. On the basis of these observations, we may conclude that the immature fibrils are not the intermediate of β2-m amyloid fibril formation but an off-pathway or dead-end product. Even so, the conformation of immature fibrils will be important because it might provide valuable information as to the productive intermediate, as is often addressed for the equilibrium molten globule intermediate of protein folding. Yamaguchi et al. (24Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Takahashi N. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8499-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) studied the effect of pH on the depolymerization of amyloid fibrils monitored by ThT fluorescence, and showed that most or all of the initial fluorescence was lost at a pH above 6.0, indicating a pH-induced depolymerization. We examined the depolymerization of amyloid fibrils at pH 8.5 (Fig.4). We noticed an interesting feature of the depolymerization reaction; the reaction was dependent upon the incubation time at pH 2.5. The fibrils long after their formation were difficult to depolymerize completely at neutral pH. One possible reason for this is an aggregation of the fibrils as shown by the electron micrographs; aggregated or clustered fibrils were predominant for the samples older than 1 week (Fig. 1C). The electron micrographs for fresh preparations of the amyloid fibrils did not show such aggregates (Fig. 1B) as reported previously (16Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar,17Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The disulfide bond of β2-m could not be reduced notably with 10 mm DTT at pH 8.5 and 25 °C in the absence of denaturant as monitored by reversed-phase HPLC, indicating that the bond in the intact β2-m was buried in the interior of the protein molecule, as observed for the constant domain of the immunoglobulin light chain (28Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,29Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 321-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reduction of a disulfide bond of β2-m was then carried out with 10 mm DTT in 5 m urea at pH 8.5 and 25 °C, where the protein is partly destabilized (Fig.5A). The HPLC analysis of the reaction product in 5 m urea revealed a clear separation of the intact and reduced molecules with two sharp peaks appearing at distinct elution times, indicating that HPLC analysis is useful for the quantitative evaluation of the disulfide bond reduction. The fraction of reduced β2-m calculated from its peak area increased exponentially with incubation time, and most of the molecules were reduced after several hours (Fig. 6A). When the reduction by 2 mm DTT was carried out in the presence of 4 m GdnHCl at pH 8.5 and 37 °C, where the protein was completely unfolded, the reduction was completed rapidly in 1 h (Fig. 6B). This result confirmed that the intrinsic reduction rate of the exposed disulfide bond by DTT is very rapid under the conditions used. To estimate the extent of protection in the native state in the absence of denaturant, the reduction of the disulfide bond was carried out in the presence of 200 mm DTT at 37 °C (Fig. 6C). At this high concentration of DTT and elevated temperature, we could observe the complete reduction of the disulfide bond in several hours.FIG. 6Reduction of disulfide bonds of monomeric β2-m by DTT at pH 8.5. The solvent conditions were 10 mm DTT and 5 m urea at 25 °C (A), 2 mm DTT and 4 mGdnHCl at 37 °C (B), and 200 mm DTT in the absence of denaturant at 37 °C (C). The linesshow the first-order kinetics with kapp = 0.0047 min−1 (A), kapp = 2.7 min−1 (B), and kapp = 0.01 min−1 (C), obtained by curve-fitting analysis using the non-linear least squares procedure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We assumed first-order kinetics with the apparent rate constantkapp, fre = exp(−kapp × t), wherefre is the fraction of reduced species, t is the reaction time, and the observed kinetics were analyzed by the least squares curve-fitting procedure to obtainkapp. The kapp value at 2 mm DTT in 4 m GdnHCl, pH 8.5, and 37 °C was 2.7 min−1, and the value increased linearly with increase in the concentration of DTT, 3D.-P. Hong, M. Gozu, K. Hasegawa, H. Naiki, and Y. Goto, unpublished data. suggesting that the disulfide bond is completely exposed to the solvent. In contrast, the reaction in the absence of denaturant was still very slow with kapp = 0.010 min−1 in the presence of 200 mm DTT. Taking into account the difference in DTT concentration, the protection factor of the disulfide bond of β2-m in the native state was calculated to be 2.7 × 104. The protection factor in 5m urea at pH 8.5 and 25 °C was at least 3 × 103, although the exact calculation could not be done because of the difference in experimental temperatures. Ohhashi et al. (17Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have examined the conformation and stability of the reduced β2-m in comparison with the intact form. They showed by CD and fluorescence measurements that at pH 8.5 the global conformation of the reduced β2-m is similar to that of the intact β2-m, although the stability is decreased significantly. They also showed that reduction of the disulfide bond completely abolishes the ability of β2-m to form mature amyloid fibrils, suggesting a critical role of the disulfide bond in the amyloid fibril formation of β2-m. If so, would the disulfide bonds in amyloid fibrils be protected? Because the fibrils are prepared and stable under acidic conditions and the fibrils depolymerize at neutral pH, it would be preferable to examine the reduction of the disulfide bond at acidic pH. However, no available disulfide-reducing reagent was reactive at pH 2.5. Therefore, we carried out the reduction of the disulfide bonds with DTT at pH 8.5, although we anticipated that the competition between reduction and depolymerization complicates the interpretation (Fig. 5B). In the absence of the denaturant, the disulfide bond of monomeric native β2-m proteins was only slightly reduc"

Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The membrane binding properties common to these abundant and ubiquitous proteins have suggested their involvement in numerous cellular functions such as membrane trafficking, exocytosis, endocytosis, membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, regulation of membrane protein activity, and signal transduction. Some members of the annexin family are also found in the extracellular compartment and are thus expected to respond to lipid signaling rather than to calcium signaling since extracellular calcium concentration is in the millimolar range. Exposure of negatively charged lipids, especially phosphatidylserine (PS),1 at the external surface of the cellular plasma membrane constitutes a biologically important ensemble of signaling events. PS exposure at the cellular surface is, for instance, one of the earliest detectable molecular events in apoptosis (4Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which binds to PS-containing membranes, has been reported as an anticoagulant protein (6Tait J.F. Sakata M.

Biol. 1991; 217: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ANX-A5 is also used, when conjugated to fluorescent label, for detecting cells undergoing apoptosis (7Vermes I.C. Hassen Reutelinsperger C.P.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 38-52Google Scholar). The annexins are composed of a highly conserved four-domain core and a variable N-terminal segment. The N-terminal segment is most probably directly related to the diversity of the functional properties. The four-domain core, which harbors several calcium-binding sites, is responsible for the calcium-mediated membrane recognition and binding (1-Google Scholar, 2-Google Scholar, 3Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The structure of an annexin domain is highly conserved and comprises five α-helices named A to E (see Fig. 1). The calcium-binding sites are well documented as a result of the numerous crystal structures now available (8Huber R. Römich J. Pâques E.-P.

The AB loop site has the highest affinity for calcium. In contrast, and although the annexin family has been known for many years (17Creutz C.E. Pazoles C.J. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2858-2866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the major PS-binding site has not been reported yet because of the difficulty of obtaining crystals of lipid-bound annexin. Nevertheless, using glycerophosphoserine (GPS) as a ligand for the annexin-calcium complex, a first possible PS-binding site could be identified in the ANX-A5 domain 3 (18Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This site comprises two calcium ions, one in the AB site and the other in the B-site. However, domain 3 was later on shown to be poorly involved in membrane binding, whereas domain 1 was found to play a prominent role in the lipid-binding process of ANX-A5 (19Mira J.P. Dubois T. Oudinet J.P. Lukowski S. Russo-Marie F. Geny B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10474-10482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Dubois T. Mira J.P. Feliers D. Solito E. Russo-Marie F. Oudinet J.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, the ANX-A5 domain 3 lipid-binding site may be considered either as a low affinity secondary site or as a hardly accessible site as suggested by a recent work (21Oling F. Sopkova-De Oliveira Santos J. Govorukhina N. Mazères-Dubut C. Bergsma-Schutter W. Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding these binding data, the crystallographic data involving domain 3 can be readily transposed to domain 1 or domain 2, which are identical as they possess exactly the same ligands for the two calcium-binding sites and then a priori the same capacity of binding PS. These observations emphasize the complexity of annexins and clearly indicate that the properties of the protein-membrane interface must also be considered. From a general standpoint, how interfacial proteins such as annexins behave at the membrane surface still remains a quite complex matter. This is due to the properties of the membrane interface itself, which has to be considered as a “two-dimensional” intermediate reservoir of a few angstroms of thickness between the bulk solution and the hydrophobic membrane interior. The interaction of the protein moiety with ions, especially divalent cations such as calcium, may be considerably different from that in pure bulk solution. This is also true for interactions with lipid polar heads. Several past works have emphasized these aspects (22Denisov G. Wanaski S. Luan P. Glaser M. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Murray D. Arbuzova A. Hangyás-Mihályné G. Gambhir A. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1999; 7: 3176-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the problem is even more complicated in the case of annexins due to the presence, in these proteins, of numerous potential calcium-binding sites with subtle differences. In addition, there is no guarantee that results obtained from bulk solutions will still hold for the membrane interface. It is also worth emphasizing the low intrinsic affinity of annexins for calcium and the apparent absence of binding to isolated phospholipids in the bulk solution. Clearly binding of calcium and phospholipid polar heads has to be understood from properties within the interface. When a phospholipid bilayer is concerned, radiocrystallography as well as NMR hardly provide the essential information at atomic resolution. Thus, we turned to molecular modeling to take a step further in the understanding of molecular recognition of phosphatidylserine polar head by annexins. We now describe a new lipid-binding site for PS. The site was first established using molecular simulation and docking of a PS molecule onto the ANX-A5 domain 1 (Fig.1). Thus, we could identify a consensus sequence that was found in either domain 1 or domain 2 of all known annexins, sometimes simultaneously in both domains, but never in domains 3 or 4. Mutational analysis of this consensus sequence demonstrated its direct involvement in membrane binding and PS recognition. From these results, a more complete picture is now emerging; binding of ANX-A5 to PS-containing membranes involves at least two calcium ions and two phosphoserine polar heads in domain 1 acting cooperatively, one bridging the AB and B calcium ions (18Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and using only few protein ligands and one using the AB calcium ion and about seven protein ligands. Other secondary sites may also contribute to membrane binding at high calcium concentrations. A direct and precise measurement of the intrinsic affinity of the AB site for calcium is also presented for the first time. The PS molecule was first drawn, with an approximately correct orientation of the polar head, near the supposed binding site, namely the region between the helices A and D of domain 1, where a sulfate group is observed in the crystallographic structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1avr (8Huber R. Römich J. Pâques E.-P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3867-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar)). At this step, the phosphate group was positioned near the calcium atom. To compensate for the absence of an adequate force field, the calcium atoms were maintained by ion-protein constraints derived from the crystallographic data. The lipid and the six-residue side chains located in the space between helices A and D were allowed to move, whereas the remaining parts of the domain were held fixed. A low temperature dynamic (50 K, ≈10 ps) was then run until the PS polar head remained approximately stationary. This allowed us to enumerate the polar head-domain interactions described in Fig. 2 A and reveal a consensus sequence in the annexin family. The model was subsequently refined. During refinement, again to compensate for the absence of an adequate calcium force field, an additional distance constraint between the calcium ions and the closest PS phosphate oxygen atom was applied to maintain the distance between these two atoms larger than 2.4 Å. The structure of the complex given in Fig. 2 B was obtained after a few runs of simulated annealing preceded by a short dynamic at 100 K and final minimization. We utilized the Sybyl program (Tripos Inc.) in this work. The structure of domain 1 with three PS molecules (see Fig.4) was obtained in the same way.Figure 4Model building of ANX-A5 domain 1 with the three PS-binding sites occupied. The same docking procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” was used for the apical site and accessory DE site. The average distance between glycerol C2 atoms is ∼8 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The wild type M234, M134, and M1234 mutants of ANX-A5 cDNA were cloned in a pGex 2T expression vector. M1, M2, and M3 mutations correspond to E72Q, D144N, and D228A respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Suppression of consensus sequence in the first domain (R25A, K29S, R65S, D68A) was obtained from M234 ANX-A5. The cDNAs of each mutant were sequenced in their full length using the ABI prism sequencing kit. Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were essentially performed as described elsewhere (20Dubois T. Mira J.P. Feliers D. Solito E. Russo-Marie F. Oudinet J.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain BL21 Gold (from Stratagene) was used. 100 ml of LB medium containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin precultures were incubated at 37 °C overnight. One liter of 150 μg/ml ampicillin LB medium was inoculated with the preculture to get a 0.2 OD600. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C until a 0.8 OD600 was reached, and then 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the medium. The cultures were stopped at OD600 level stabilization (around 2.0 OD600). Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (15 min at 3000 × g), the pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinine. After incubation for 1 h with lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml) followed by sonication, lysed bacteria were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose column. Columns were washed with 1 m NaCl and with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and all steps were performed at 4 °C. GST-annexin V mutants were cleaved by thrombin (10 units/mg of fusion protein) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 150 mmNaCl at room temperature. Final purification was performed on a Ressource Q (fast protein liquid chromatography system, AmershamBiosciences). Purity and identification of all proteins were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were concentrated with an ultrafiltration apparatus (Amicon) with YM10 membranes. Protein concentrations were evaluated using the method of Bradford and UV absorption at 280 nm. The standard copelleting assays contained 30 mg/ml mixed POPC/POPS (80/20) liposomes equilibrated in a Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2) with the indicated concentration of free CaCl2. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature with 5 μm protein, the vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation (270,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C). Supernatant (S1) containing unbound proteins is removed. The pellets containing the bound proteins were resuspended with a Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm EDTA . After a 15-min incubation, vesicles were pelleted, and supernatants (S2) were collected for SDS-PAGE gel analysis. Surface plasmon resonance binding experiments were performed on a Biacore 2000 apparatus using L1 chips coated with 2 mg/ml mixed POPS/POPC (80/20) size-calibrated liposomes using a LiposoFast apparatus (Avestin) with 100-nm pore diameter polycarbonate membranes. Binding experiments were performed in a degassed HBS-N buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 2 mm CaCl2. This buffer was used during equilibration, association, and dissociation phases. Proteins were added to this buffer at the indicated concentrations during association phase. Regeneration of phospholipid bilayer after dissociation phase was performed using 2 mm EDTA in HBS-N buffer. The typical surface plasmon resonance experiment for each protein concentration proceeds in four steps: the equilibration of phospholipid bilayer with HBS-N buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+during 60 s, the association phase during which protein in a determined concentration is added to this buffer during 60 s, the dissociation phase during which HBS-N buffer with 2 mmCa2+ is flowed through the detection cell during 400 s, and the regeneration phase during which 2 mm EDTA in HBS-N buffer is used to remove proteins bound to the bilayer at the end of the dissociation phase. Evaluations of kinetics data were performed using Bialevaluation 3.0 software. Association and dissociation rate constants were independently evaluated. Dissociation rate constants were determined from the last 200 s of the dissociation phase to avoid non-pure membrane-protein dissociation occurring at the beginning of dissociation phase. Two models were used, a simple Langmuir dissociation model and a cooperative dissociation model following the equation,koff(app)=koff(1+Ad∗R/Rmax)Equation 1 where k off(app) is the apparent dissociation rate constant, k off is the dissociation rate constant, Ad is the cooperativity parameter for dissociation, R is the response, andRmax is the saturation response. Residuals between experimental values and fit values never exceed 4 response units. Both models led to the same dissociation rate values even if the Langmuir model generated non-random distributed residuals, unlike the cooperative dissociation model. The association phase was fitted with a Langmuir model, excluding the first 10 s of association. Residuals never exceeded 10 response units. The association rate constant (k on) for each protein concentration was calculated from the kinetic during the association phase, using the dissociation rate constant evaluated for the same protein concentration. Errors on the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) were calculated from fittedk on and k off using the following equation,dKD=koffkon∗dkoffkoff+dkonkonEquation 2 where dK D is the standard error onK D , dk off is the standard error on k off, and dk onis the standard error on k on. Uniformly 15N-labeled proteins were obtained by growing E. coli in a minimal medium containing ammonium sulfate as the exclusive nitrogen source. The purification protocol was identical to the one described above for unlabeled proteins. The proteins were finally obtained in a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.5) containing 10% D2O. NMR experiments were carried out on Bruker DRX 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with 5-mm triple-resonance gradient probe with actively shielded three-axis gradients. All experiments were performed at 293 K and pH 8.5. The pH was checked after each calcium addition. Standard FHSQC (36Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) were recorded with a quadrature detection by the TPPI-States method (37Marion D. Kay L.E. Sparks S.W. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1515-1517Crossref Scopus (591) Google Scholar). 15N decoupling during acquisition was performed using a GARP sequence (38Haka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). The number of scans was between 8 and 32, and the number of points was 2048 in the direct dimension. 200 increments were used in the indirect dimension. The recycling delay was 1.5 s. The spectral width were of 6.2 and 4.1 kHz in the1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. For each annexin V mutant, FHSQC spectra were recorded at the following calcium concentrations: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 15, and 30 mm. Addition of an excess of EDTA was performed at the end of the titration. The spectrum was superimposable on that obtained at 0 mm calcium. At high calcium concentration, an important reduction of the peak intensities and an increase of the line width showed the presence of protein aggregation. This phenomenon was reversible after addition of EDTA. NMR spectra were processed using the GIFA software (39Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A (π/4) shifted squared cosine bell and a (π/4) squared cosine bell were applied along t 1 and t 2, respectively. The data were zero-filled to 1024 points alongt 1 and to 2048 points alongt 2 prior to Fourier transform. Finally, a baseline correction was applied in both dimensions using the corresponding GIFA baseline routine (40Rouh A. Delsuc M.A. Bertrand G. Lallemand J.Y. J Magn. Reson. (Series A). 1993; 102: 357-359Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Difference spectra were performed and allowed to identify most of the correlation peaks that are sensitive to the calcium concentration. The GIFA peak-picking routine was used to determine the chemical shift variation of these correlation peaks. The titration of M1234 led to the determination of the correlation peaks that are sensitive to secondary calcium sites. By difference, it was possible to identify the correlation peaks that are sensitive to the primary calcium site for M234 and for the mutants of M234 with mutated phospholipid equatorial site. The chemical shift variation against the calcium variation was fitted with the following function,Δδobs=ΔδppmCaCa+KDEquation 3 where Δδobs is the observed chemical shift variation, Δδ ppm is the difference between the free and bound protein, Ca is the bulk calcium concentration, and K D is the dissociation constant. The fitting was achieved using the non-linear Levenburg-Marquardt minimization algorithm (41Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1988Google Scholar) implemented in the MATLAB software. The quality of the fits and the uncertainties was obtained from statistical analysis (42Palmer III, A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 43Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) with an experimental Gaussian error set to 0.01 and 0.1 ppm in the 1H dimension and in the 15N dimension, respectively, and using a set of 500 synthetic data for each data set. A model was considered satisfactory if the optimized χexp2 obtained for the experimental data lay within the 95% confidence limit obtained from the 500 Monte Carlo simulations, i.e.χexp2 < χ95%2. The uncertainties in the values of the calcium affinity were the standard deviation of the 500 simulated calcium affinities. We started from two observations: (i) domain 1 is the unique domain for which removal of the type II calcium-binding site removes almost all the membrane binding property of the whole protein (19,20) and (ii) sulfate ions used to grow annexin crystals are often found bonded to a pair of very close Arg residues, Arg25 and Arg63 in the case of ANX-A5 domain 1, suggesting the involvement of these residues in phospholipid binding. Then we docked a PS molecule onto domain 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). By analogy with phospholipase A2, which possesses a calcium-binding loop very close to that of annexins, we positioned the phosphate group of the PS molecule in contact with the calcium ion in domain 1. We then searched for complementary electrostatic interactions between the PS polar head and annexin residues. This led us to identify a potential binding site as described below. As shown in Fig.2 A, the PS-domain 1 interactions involve: (i) a subset of positively charged groups comprising the calcium ion in the AB (type II) calcium-binding site, the Gly30 backbone HN, the side chain NH3+ of Lys29, the Arg25 and Arg63 side chains, and: (ii) a subset of negatively charged groups comprising the Asp68 carboxyl side chain, the Ser71 Oγ relayed by a water molecule and one of the side chain oxygen atom of Glu72, the so-called bidentate calcium ligand. The presence of a bridging water molecule between the Ser71 Oγ and the polar head amino roup was established by molecular dynamics simulation with explicit solvent (data not shown). In ANX-A5 domain 1 the sequence involved in PS binding can be read as Arg25-X 3-Lys29 … Arg63-X 4-Asp68-X 2-Ser71-Glu72. The side chains of this ensemble of residues form a highly polarized pocket well adapted to the binding of the phosphatidylserine polar head with a negative side, Asp68-Ser71-Glu72, and a positive side, Ca2+-Lys29-Arg25-Arg63. Using low temperature molecular dynamics simulation as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the PS-annexin complex was further refined, leading to the structure given in Fig. 2 B. Searching the whole known annexin sequence family, we found the above sequence or a very closely related sequence in either domain 1 or domain 2, sometimes in both (ANX-A4 and -A7), in all annexins. An example for human annexins is given in Fig.3. Remarkably, the sequence is never observed in any domain 3 or domain 4. From this analysis, the following consensus sequence for PS binding may be proposed: (R/K)XXXK-(B-C helices)-(R/K)XXXXDXXS(D/E) + Ca2+. There are a few modifications of this sequence in some domains 2: in ANX-A2, where the third basic residue is shifted one residue upstream, in ANX-A7, in domain 2, the Lys29 is replaced by a Gln residue, and in ANX-A13, where the (R/K)25 residue is also replaced by an uncharged residue Gln. Gln residue is, however, still able to bind to the PS phosphate group. The lipid-free annexin calcium complex presents the characteristic pentagonal bipyramid geometry (8Huber R. Römich J. Pâques E.-P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3867-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C): an equatorial plan with five possible coordinations and two possible apical coordinations normal to the equatorial plan. Four equatorial coordinations have protein ligands, namely the Gly30–Gly32 backbone carbonyls and the two Glu72 carboxylic oxygen atoms for domain 1. The fifth equatorial coordination is free, i.e. only occupied by a water oxygen atom. One apical coordination points toward the domain core (the Met-28 backbone carbonyl), and the second points toward the solution and is free. This geometry allows us to define two types of PS-binding sites according to which of the two above free coordinations is occupied by a PS phosphate group. We propose, for domain 1, to name these two sites: the equatorial site, or D1e, and the apical site or D1a. The D1e site corresponds to the consensus sequence described in this report with the phosphate group bound to the fifth equatorial coordination. The D1a site would correspond to the site described for GPS in domain 3 (18Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) with the PS phosphate group bound to the remaining apical coordination and its carboxylic group bound to the Ca2+ in the B-site. The calcium B-site is located in the generally conserved sequence TXE at the N terminus of the B-helix. It comprises one backbone carbonyl oxygen atom from Thr and two oxygen atoms (bidentate) from the Glu side chain. Docking of a PS molecule on the D1a site shows that the other PS interactions in this site concern the Thr33 and Glu35 side chains, hydrogen-bonding the PS amino group, and the backbone Gly32 HN hydrogen-bonding the two oxygen atoms of the phosphate group, one of which is the serine γ-oxygen atom. Simultaneous binding of two PS molecules to the same AB calcium-binding site (i.e. simultaneous occupancy of both D1a and D1e sites) is sterically possible (Fig. 4). Remarkably enough, binding of two PS molecules allows a full coordination of the AB calcium ion, five ligands from the protein and two from the lipid molecules. Thus, although the D3a (GPS site) does not apparently promote membrane binding as demonstrated below, occupancy of the D1a site most certainly directly contributes to the stabilization of the complex and thus to membrane binding. The secondary low affinity calcium binding in the D-helix C terminus site (Fig. 1 C, DE site) involves two backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms from D-helix and one side-chain ligand from the E-helix Glu78 residue. Docking a PS molecule at this site, with the phosphate group bound to the calcium ion, reveals additional possible interactions of the Glu78 and Arg79 with the ammonium and carboxylic group of the PS polar head, respectively. Such interactions may constitute another secondary, low-af"

We report a procedure capable of yielding Sco1p of >95% purity. Sco1p has been purified from strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae that overexpress the protein. The amino-terminal sequence of purified Sco1p indicates that the first 40 amino acids of the primary translation product constitute a mitochondrial targeting sequence that is proteolytically cleaved during import. We estimate that Sco1p constitutes 0.08% total mitochondrial proteins in wild type yeast and 5% in the transformant used for the purification. Sco1p contains ∼1 mol of copper/mol protein. The copper is not removed by the treatment of Sco1p with EDTA, indicating that it is bound with high affinity. Purified Sco1p sediments identical to Sco1p in crude extracts of mitochondria from wild type yeast or from a strain transformed with SCO1 on a high copy plasmid.

The first center, CuA, is associated with Cox2p and acts as the first acceptor of electrons from reduced cytochromec. The second center, CuB, consists of a single copper atom bound to Cox1p where together with heme A of cytochromea 3 it functions in reduction of molecular oxygen. Two nuclear genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been proposed to function in mitochondrial copper homeostasis and COX assembly (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

The proposed function of Sco1p as a copper transferase was based on the ability of SCO1 to act as a high copy suppressor ofcox17 mutants (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Kuschel M. Paret C. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The involvement of Sco1p in mitochondrial copper metabolism is more directly supported by recent studies showing that a soluble fragment of Sco1p, expressed inEscherichia coli, binds 1 copper/molecule of protein (10Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To learn more about the properties of Sco1p, we have purified the native protein from yeast and characterized its copper-binding property. We have also determined the site at which the Sco1p precursor is processed by the matrix protease and the size of the native protein. The evidence obtained with constructs expressing Sco1p lacking the membrane-spanning domain or having its normal import signal substituted with the leader of cytochrome c 1 shows that the localization and orientation of the protein are essential for its function. Sco1p was purified from two different strains of S. cerevisiae. E428/U1/ST5 is asco1 mutant (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) transformed with pG41/ST5, a high copy plasmid containing the wild type SCO1 gene on a 1.9-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment (Fig. 1). E428/U1/ST28 was obtained by transformation of the same mutants with pG41/ST28, which contains both SCO1 and COX17 on a 1.2-kilobase pair HindIII fragment (Fig. 1). For large-scale purifications, cells maintained on minimal galactose (yeast nitrogen base plus 2% galactose) were inoculated and grown to stationary phase in liquid galactose medium (YPGal) containing 4% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 1% peptone with or without 50 μm copper sulfate. A gene lacking the sequence for the internal membrane-spanning domain of Sco1p was constructed by PCR amplification of the gene in pG41/ST5 (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

The resultant plasmid, pG41/ST23, was identical to pG41/ST5 with the exception that it lacked the internal 51 nucleotides coding for amino acid residues 75–90 of Sco1p (Fig. 1).

The PCR product lacking the sequence coding for the amino-terminal 40 residues of the import signal was digested with BclI andSalI and cloned into pG101/ST10. The gene in the resultant plasmid (pG41/ST24) codes for the following sequence at the junction of cytochrome c 1 and Sco1p: glu-ala ↓ met-thr-ala-ala-Asp-gln-ser-asn-gly where the arrow demarcates the processing site in cytochromec 1, the lowercase residues are part of the cytochrome c 1 leader, the capitalized residues are created by the new restriction site at the junction, and the italicized residues correspond to the amino-terminal end of mature Sco1p. This gene was further modified by removing the sequence coding for the transmembrane segment by PCR amplification of pG41/ST24 with the bidirectional primers described by Buchwald et al. (11Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmids were designated as pG41/ST44 (Fig.1). All the high copy plasmids were used to transform the sco1 null strain W303ΔSCO1 (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of E428/U1/ST5 or E428/U1/ST28 (15 ml) grown in YPGal was inoculated into 800 ml fresh YPGal medium and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 17–18 h. In a typica1 purification, 40 flasks each containing 800 ml of YPGal were used yielding ∼500–600 g of wet weight cells. All steps are carried out at 4 °C. The materials obtained after steps 3 and 5–10 can be stored frozen at −80 °C. In step 1, cells were harvested at 800 × g, washed twice with 3.5 liters of 1.2 m sorbitol and suspended in 1.2 liters of buffer containing 1.2 m sorbitol, 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biochemicals). After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, 80–90% of the cells were converted to spheroplasts. In step 2, the spheroplasts were centrifuged at 2,600 ×g for 20 min, washed twice with 3 liters of 1.2m sorbitol, and lysed in 1.2 liters of STE buffer (0.5m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysed spheroplasts were homogenized in a Waring blender for 40 s and centrifuged at 640 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was washed with 600 ml of STE buffer (0.5 msorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The first supernatant and wash were combined and centrifuged at 640 × g to remove remaining cell debris. In step 3, the mitochondria obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant from step 2 at 14,700 × g avfor 30 min were washed three times in 0.5 m sorbitol and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, suspended in the same buffer at a protein concentration of 20–30 mg/ml, and sonically irradiated for 45 s in a 100-ml beaker with a Branson sonifier using a microtip probe at a power output of 60 watts. The submitochondrial particles (SMP) were sedimented in a Beckman ultracentrifuge at 79,000 ×g av for 45 min and suspended in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at a final protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. In step 4, to the SMP suspension were added solid KCl to a final concentration of 1 m, 0.01 volumes of 20 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 volumes of 10% potassium deoxycholate. After centrifugation at 79,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant containing Sco1p was collected. The materials obtained after steps 3 and 5–10 can be stored frozen at −80 °C. In step 5, to the deoxycholate extract from step 4 was added an equal volume of cold water and 20% potassium cholate to a final concentration of 0.5%. Saturated ammonium sulfate (4 °C) was added to a final concentration of 26% saturation, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 79,000 × g for 10 min. The clear reddish supernatant was adjusted to 42% ammonium sulfate saturation with cold saturated ammonium sulfate. The greenish pellet obtained after centrifugation at 79,000 × g for 10 min was dissolved in 15 ml of TT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.05% Triton X-100) and was desalted on a 120-ml column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated in TT buffer. The desalted proteins elute as a green-colored band in ∼30 ml. In step 6, the fraction from step 5 was diluted to 200 ml with TT buffer and applied to a 5 × 17-cm column of Cibacron Blue 3GA cross-linked to agarose (Sigma). The column was washed sequentially with 1) 400 ml of TT buffer, 2) 200 ml of TT buffer containing 1.0m KCL, 3) 200 ml of TT buffer, 4) 500 ml of a 0–0.5% linear gradient of potassium deoxycholate in TT buffer, and 5) 700 ml of 0.5% potassium deoxycholate in TT buffer. Fractions (15 ml) were collected, separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and stained with silver. Most of Sco1p elutes in the potassium deoxycholate gradient and subsequent 0.5% deoxycholate wash. Fractions containing Sco1p were pooled (∼1 liter). When frozen, this material may develop a white precipitate upon thawing. The precipitate can be removed on a 0.45-μ filter without loss of Sco1p. In step 7, the pool from the Cibacron Blue column was applied to a 50-ml column of hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with TT buffer. Following loading of the sample, the column was washed with 75 ml of TT buffer. The protein is eluted with 50 ml of 0.3m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.05% Triton X-100. This fraction is desalted on a 350-ml column of Sephadex G-25 superfine (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TT buffer. The desalted protein eluting as a single 280-nm absorbing peak is collected in ∼50 ml. Because of the weak adsorption of Sco1p to mono-S, in the next step it is important to remove all the salt on the Sephadex column. In step 8, a preparative high pressure liquid chromatography mono-S column (8 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) was washed with 25 ml of TT buffer and 1.0 m NaCl followed by 50 ml of TT buffer. After application of the desalted fraction from step 7, the column was washed with 1) 20 mm NaCl in TT buffer, 2) 80 ml of a 0–0.1m linear gradient of NaCl in TT buffer, and 3) 80 ml of 0.1m NaCl in TT buffer. Fractions of 8 ml were collected and analyzed for Sco1p on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Sco1p elutes in ∼70 ml of TT buffer peaking at 0.1 m NaCl. In step 9, the pool from step 8 was diluted to 150 ml with TT buffer and applied to a 1 ml of fast protein liquid chromatography mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 5 ml of TT buffer followed by 5 ml of 0.35 m NaCl in TT buffer. Sco1p elutes as a single 280-nm absorbing band and is recovered in ∼2 ml. In step 10, purified Sco1p was desalted on a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 superfine column equilibrated in TT buffer. Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for the transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from E. coli(14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J.

Proteins were analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Western blots were treated with antibodies against the Sco1p (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Copper was determined by atomic absorption in a graphite furnace (Galbraith Laboratories, Knoxville, TN). The amino terminus of purified Sco1p was sequenced with an AP Biosystems Procise Model 494 microsequencer (Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Columbia University). The concentration of Sco1p in E428/U1/ST5 is ∼50 μg/mg mitochondrial protein. This value is raised by another factor of 1.7 in SMP, the starting material used for the purification. The results of a typical fractionation are summarized in Table I and Fig.2. The extraction of the SMPs with deoxycholate solubilizes 70% of the protein almost half of which is lost during the ammonium sulfate fractionation. Further losses occur at each succeeding step resulting in the recovery of only 2–3% of the starting material. The procedure yields 1.5 mg of Sco1p/gram of SMP protein. The purity of Sco1p is ∼95% based on scans of silver-stained gels.Table IPurification and recovery of Sco1p1-aThe purification of Sco1p was carried out with mitochondria prepared from E428/U1/ST5 grown in 32 liters of YPGal medium.FractionTotal protein1-aThe purification of Sco1p was carried out with mitochondria prepared from E428/U1/ST5 grown in 32 liters of YPGal medium.Sco1p1-bThe concentration of Sco1p was determined by quantitative Western blot analysis.

Open table in a new tab The copper content of purified Sco1p was determined by atomic absorption and corrected for adventitious copper in the buffer used to dissolve the protein. The values obtained for three different preparations are reported in TableII. The purity of two of the preparations used for the copper analysis is shown in Fig. 2, A andB. The copper content ranged from 0.7–1.0 mol/mol of Sco1p and was not significantly different in preparations obtained from E428/U1/ST5 or E428/U1/ST28. The supplementation of the medium with different concentrations of copper did not raise the copper content above 1 mol/mol protein. The purified protein was also incubated under anaerobic conditions in the presence of cuprous chloride alone or in combination with purified Cox17p (3Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 372: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Neither condition led to any increase in the amount of protein-bound copper. Finally, the incubation of purified Sco1p in the presence of EDTA caused only a moderate decrease in the copper content, indicating that the copper is bound with high affinity. These results confirm that native Sco1p is a copper-binding protein. The several preparations used for the copper assays suggest a stoichiometry of 1 copper/molecule of protein, a value that is in agreement with the stoichiometry of copper recently reported for a soluble fragment of Sco1p expressed in E. coli(10Nittis T.

The protein was concentrated on a Centricon filter. Open table in a new tab The sequence of the amino-terminal six residues (ESNGKK) of Sco1p purified from E428/U1/ST5 matches the sequence deduced from the gene sequence (2Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) starting with the serine at residue 42. The preceding residue 41 based on the gene sequence should be a glutamine instead of the glutamic acid indicated by the protein sequence. This finding suggests that following cleavage of the presequence, the amino-terminal Gln42 of the mature protein is deaminated. To estimate the mitochondrial concentration of Sco1p, a standard curve was obtained relating known amounts of the purified protein to the signal detected by Western blot analysis. The mitochondria from a wild type strain and from the E428/U1/ST5 transformant were similarly analyzed on the same Western blot (Fig. 3). The concentration of Sco1p in wild type mitochondria was calculated to be 0.8 μg (27 pmol) of Sco1p per milligram of protein. This value is 2–3 times lower than the concentration of Cox17p (80 pmol/mg protein) determined previously (3Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 372: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The concentration of Sco1p in E428/U1/ST5 mitochondria was 52 μg (1.7 nmol) per milligram of protein, indicating a 60-fold overexpression from the multicopy plasmid. The mass of Sco1p was estimated from its sedimentation relative to hemoglobin in sucrose gradients (18Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size of Sco1p was determined by sedimentation analysis in sucrose gradients of wild type and E428/U/ST5 mitochondrial extracts and of the purified protein. Based on its sedimentation relative to hemoglobin (Fig. 4), native Sco1p has a mass of 88 kDa. The fact that the overexpressed and purified protein sedimented similarly to Sco1p extracted from wild type mitochondria indicates that it is not stably associated with other proteins. The mass of the mature Sco1p monomer is 28.7 kDa, suggesting that the native protein is a homotrimer. Sco1p is an intrinsic inner membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain (11Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a topology such that the carboxyl-terminal region containing the active site faces the intermembrane space (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sco1p behaves as a water-soluble protein when expressed from a gene lacking the sequence coding for the transmembrane domain (11Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The water-soluble form of Sco1p was found not to be functional as evidence by its inability to complement sco1 mutants (11Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the maturation of subunit 2 might require that Sco1p be present in the inner membrane. 2The finding that soluble Sco1p expressed inE. coli has bound copper (10Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) makes the alternate explanation that membrane localization is required for copper addition less probable. However, in that study, the location of the soluble Sco1p was not determined. Hence, if Sco1p lacking the transmembrane domain is transported to the matrix, the mislocalization could also account for failure to complement the mutant. To address this question, we first examined the compartment in which soluble Sco1p is located. Resistance against protease K (Fig. 6) indicates that the soluble protein is transported to the matrix compartment. The matrix localization implies that the hydrophobic transmembrane domain acts as a stop-transfer sequence. The dependence of Sco1p function on its localization and/or membrane association was further examined by directing the soluble protein to the intermembrane space. The sequence of SCO1 starting from codon 41 was fused to the sequence encoding the cytochromec 1 presequence (12Sadler I. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The gene was further modified by removing the sequence coding for the transmembrane domain. The cytochrome c 1 presequence consists of an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal followed by a hydrophobic sorting sequence (20Gasser S.M. Ohashi A. Daum G. Bohni P.C. Gibson J. Reid G.A. Yonetani T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The targeting signal directs the amino terminus to the matrix where it is cleaved by the matrix-processing protease. The hydrophobic part of the presequence anchors the precursor to the inner membrane (21Arnold I. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 2731: 469-1476Google Scholar) after which cleavage by the Imp protease (22Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) causes the release of the mature amino terminus in the intermembrane space (21Arnold I. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 2731: 469-1476Google Scholar). The predication was that substitution of the cytochromec 1 bipartite signal for its normal import signal would cause Sco1p to be localized in the intermembrane space (Fig.5 C). The intermembrane localization of Sco1p expressed from this construct (pG41/ST44) was confirmed by its proteinase K sensitivity in mitoplasts but not mitochondria (Fig. 6). Most of the intermembrane Sco1p was solubilized by alkaline extraction of mitochondria with carbonate (Fig. 7). However, the protein probably has some residual hydrophobic character, because it is only partially released when mitochondria are converted to mitoplasts (Fig. 6). The retargeted soluble Sco1p failed to rescue the mutant, indicating that its postulated function in copper transfer probably requires that it be anchored to the membrane.Figure 7Carbonate extraction of native and mutant Sco1p. Mitochondria were isolated from the wild type strain W303-1A (WT) from the transformants E428/U1/ST5 (ST5) and E428/U1/ST44 (ST44) (see Fig. 1 for details of the pG41/ST5 and pG41/ST44 plasmids). The mitochondria were adjusted to 0.1 m sodium carbonate at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. After incubation on ice for 15 min, a small sample (m) was saved, and the rest was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min. Equivalent volumes of the starting sample (M), the membrane pellets (P), and soluble supernatant fraction (S) were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibody against Sco1p. The arrow in the margin identifies Sco1p. The blot with the samples from the wild type strain was exposed 50 times longer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is of interest that sco1 mutants also fail to be complemented by the SCO1 gene in pG41/ST24. The gene in this plasmid consists of the cytochrome c 1presequence fused to the entire SCO1 sequence coding for the mature protein including the transmembrane domain. The product of this gene is processed to the mature-size Sco1p that is located in the intermembrane space, but unlike the native Sco1p, it is not located as an intrinsic membrane protein (data not shown). This indicates that the transmembrane domain of Sco1p is a stop-transfer rather than a membrane-targeting/insertion sequence (21Arnold I. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 2731: 469-1476Google Scholar). The inability of this gene to complement the sco1 mutant emphasizes the importance of both compartmentation and membrane topology for Sco1p activity."

In addition, it is possible that the reagents used to deliver oligonucleotides to cells, including cationic liposomes (7Bennett C.F. Chiang M.Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar, 8Juliano R.L. Alahari S. Yoo H. Kole R. Cho M. Pharmacol. Res. 1999; 16: 494-502Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar), polymers (9Yoo H. Juliano R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), or the type of delivery peptide used in this study (10Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) could also have effects on cellular processes that lead to changes in mRNA levels. To guard against these potentially artifactual effects, investigators in the field have largely adopted a set of standards and controls that must be met before claiming a specific antisense action (11Stein C.A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although these criteria have been invaluable to this point, recent technological advances now permit even more stringent evaluation of the effects of antisense oligonucleotides. In this report we have used DNA arrays to assess the selectivity of a set of antisense and control reagents that we have reported on previously (12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus we have synthesized and evaluated peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates comprised of an oligonucleotide sequence targeted to the AUG region of the MDR1 gene or its mismatch control. These were both conjugated to a 19-amino acid sequence (Ant), adapted from the antennapedia transcription factor, that is known to be useful for intracellular delivery of peptides and oligonucleotides (10Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with the peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates, with the Ant peptide itself, or were maintained as untreated controls. Thereafter, message levels from 2059 genes were assessed using commercial, oligonucleotide-based DNA array technology (13Lockhart D.J. Winzeler E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 14Celis J.E. Kruhoffer M. Gromova I. Frederiksen C. Ostergaard M. Thykjaer T. Gromov P., Yu, J. Palsdottir H. Magnusson N. Orntoft T.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition to the expected decrease in MDR1 message level, 37 additional genes displayed changes that were regarded as significant in comparing the three experimental conditions with the control situation. The multidrug-resistant cell line MES-SA/Dx5 was obtained from the ATCC. This line, originally obtained from uterine sarcoma fibroblasts, expresses high levels of MDR-1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein (15Harker W.G. Bauer D. Etiz B.B. Newman R.A. Sikic B.I. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2369-2373PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 60 ng/ml colchicine in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates were prepared via disulfide bond formation. Specifically, phosphorothioate 20-mer anti-MDR1 5′-d(CCA-TCC-CGA-CCT-CGC-GCT-CC)-3′ and mismatch 5′-d(CCA-TAC-CAA-CAT-CAC-GCT-CC)-3′ oligonucleotides were conjugated with highly basic Ant peptide (NH2RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKGGCCOOH), and the conjugates were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as previously described (12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The conjugates also included a TAMRA (carboxylic acid of tetramethylrhodamine) fluorophore at the 3′-end. The 20-mer anti-MDR1 oligonucleotide was also used in unconjugated form in some studies below. The experimental protocols were similar to those previously described (12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, MES-SA/Dx5 cells were grown in 162-mm flasks to 95% confluency and then seeded into 100-mm dishes at 2 × 106/dish in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/McCoy's medium1 and incubated for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). The peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates or Ant peptide itself were diluted in 10% FBS/McCoy's medium to 0.5 μm and were added into the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h; after a medium change, the cells were assayed 48 h later. This protocol was used for the DNA array, Northern blotting, and flow cytometry experiments described below. We also used a scrape-loading procedure (16Sazani P. Kang S.H. Maier M.A. Wei C. Dillman J. Summerton J. Manoharan M. Kole R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3965-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) to transiently disrupt cell membranes and allow direct loading of unconjugated oligonucleotides into MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Briefly, the cells were seeded 24 h before treatment in 100-mm dishes at 1.5 × 106 cells/dish in 3 ml of medium. For scrape loading the medium was replaced with 3 ml of growth medium containing 0.5 μm 20-mer anti-MDR1 oligonucleotide. Cells were then removed from the plate with a cell scraper (Costar, Corning, NY), replated in fresh medium, and assayed 48 h later. Cell surface expression of P-glycoprotein was determined using a flow cytometry assay as previously described (12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). After treatment with the conjugates, cells were washed twice in PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in 10% FBS/McCoy's medium. The cells were washed in PBS, and 50 μl of 20 μg/ml MRK16 anti-P-glycoprotein antibody (Kamiya, Thousand Oaks, CA) was added. After incubation for 45 min on ice, cells were washed three times in 10% FBS/PBS and then incubated 30 min with an FITC conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). After the incubation, the cells were washed twice in 10% FBS/PBS. The level of FITC fluorescence in viable cells (viability determined by light scatter) was quantitated using the Summit V3.0 software application (Cytomation Inc.) on a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from the cells using a kit according to a protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The RNA concentration was measured by taking the A 260 nm. Array studies were conducted in a manner similar to those described elsewhere (17Notterman D.A. Alon U. Sierk A.J. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3124-3130PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kaminski N. Allard J.D. Pittet J.F. Zuo F. Griffiths M.J. Morris D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Isolated cytoplasmic RNA (0. 7 μg) was used to synthesize cDNA. A custom cDNA kit from Invitrogen was used with a T7-(dT)24 primer for this reaction. Biotinylated cRNA was then generated from the cDNA reaction using the BioArray high yield RNA transcript kit (Affymetrix). The cRNA was then fragmented (5× fragmentation buffer: 200 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 500 mm KOAc, 150 mm MgOAc) at 94 °C for 35 min before chip hybridization. Following the manufacturer's protocol, fragmented cRNA (15 μg) was added to the hybridization mixture. DNA arrays HC-G110 or HG-U95Av2 (Affymetrix) were hybridized for 16 h in a GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and scanned with a Hewlett Packard GeneArray Scanner. Sample quality was assessed by examination of 3′ to 5′ intensity ratios of certain genes. Samples were normalized to the average hybridization intensity on each chip. All array studies were performed as three to six independent experiments. Affymetrix GeneChip Microarray Suite 4.0 software was used for the experimental protocol and for basic analysis. The Gene Spring 4.0.2 (Silicon Genetics) software package was used for additional data analysis. Northern blotting was done according to a standard protocol (19Alwine J.C. Kemp D.J. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5350-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from the cultured cells according to a protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Qiagen Inc.). Five micrograms of RNA sample was resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel containing 1.2% formaldehyde and transferred into a nylon membrane, followed by UV cross-linking (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The blot was hybridized with32P-labeled human cDNA probes. The templates for the probes were gel-purified (gel purification kit, Qiagen Inc.) reverse transcription-PCR products of: human MDR1 with the forward primer 5′-ACC GCA ATG GAG GAG CAA AG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTA AGC TCC CCA ACA TCG TG-3′; human PKCα with the forward primer 5′-CCT TCC AAC AAC CTT GAC C-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCG TGA CTC CAT CCA TCA TG-3′; leukocyte tyrosine kinase with the forward primer 5′-CCA TTC TCT GCT CTA GCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGG CAC AGG CAT TCA GCC-3′; β-actin with the forward primer 5′-CTT CCT TCC TGG GCA TGG A-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGG AGG AGC AAT GAT CTT GA-3′. The probes were synthesized by a random priming method using a commercial kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The hybridized blot was washed twice with 2× SSC buffer at room temperature, followed by two washes of 2× SSC + 1% SDS at 60 °C and two washes of 0.1× SSC at room temperature. The blot was then exposed to Kodak film for 6–24 h prior to development. The effects of the Ant peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates in inhibiting expression of P-glycoprotein are illustrated in Fig.1. Cell surface levels of P-glycoprotein were quantitated by flow cytometry, using an antibody that is directed to a P-glycoprotein epitope displayed on the external surface of cells, followed by a fluorescent second antibody (12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As expected based on previous studies (12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we observed substantial inhibition of P-glycoprotein expression in cells treated with the antisense Ant 20 conjugate (Fig. 1 D) and little effect in cells treated with the mismatch control conjugate (Fig. 1 C, Ant 20 mismatch). Treatment with unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide or with the Ant peptide itself had no effect on P-glycoprotein levels (Ref. 12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and data not shown). The degree of inhibition of P-glycoprotein levels in the flow cytometry studies was ∼85% for Ant 20 and 2% for Ant 20 mismatch versus untreated control. To provide a broader perspective on the specificity of our peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates, we used Affymetrix DNA array technology to interrogate a set of 2059 cancer-related genes. As seen in Fig. 2, the array data on the MDR1 gene agrees with the observations of Fig. 1 and shows a substantial reduction (about 3-fold) in MDR1 message expression in the cells treated with the Ant peptide-antisense conjugate but not in cells treated with the control mismatch conjugate. We next sought other genes whose message levels changed significantly from untreated control levels in response to one of the three experimental treatments. The following criteria were used to identify such genes: (a) there must be at least a 2-fold change in message level as compared with untreated control; (b) the hybridization intensity must be above 100 arbitrary units so as to exclude weak signals; (c) the standard deviation between experiments must be less than 100% of the relative intensity so as to exclude genes that did not change in a consistent manner in the several independent experiments. These are similar to criteria used in several other studies (13Lockhart D.J. Winzeler E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 14Celis J.E. Kruhoffer M. Gromova I. Frederiksen C. Ostergaard M. Thykjaer T. Gromov P., Yu, J. Palsdottir H. Magnusson N. Orntoft T.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, 38 genes including MDR1 were identified (Table I), which is ∼2% of the genes sampled. Both increases and decreases in gene expression were observed. As shown in Table I, and in more detail in Table II, the selected genes can be divided into three different clusters. These are: (a) genes specifically affected by a particular peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (genes affected by Ant 20 or by Ant 20 mismatch); (b) genes affected by treatment with both antisense and mismatch control conjugates (genes affected by both Ant 20 and Ant 20 mismatch); (c) genes affected by the presence of the Ant peptide (genes affected by Ant 20, Ant 20 mismatch, and Ant). Thus cells can respond through changes in gene expression to particular oligonucleotide sequences, to the intracellular presence of peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates in a sequence-independent fashion, or to the presence of the polycationic delivery peptide. The affected genes did not belong to any obvious functional group or pathway.Table ICompilation of genes affected by peptide-oligonucleotide conjugatesNameNumber of genes affectedGenes increasedGenes decreasedSpecific genesSpecific genes increasedSpecific genes decreasedGenes affected by Ant 2024131114410Genes affected by Ant 20 mismatch201281037Genes affected by Ant862422Genes affected by both Ant 20 and Ant 20 mismatch1091Genes affected by Ant 20 and Ant 20 mismatch and Ant440The number of genes significantly affected by a particular treatment is shown.

The data for the Ant 20 (antisense) conjugate represents six independent experiments. The data for the Ant 20 mismatch and the unconjugated Ant peptide represent three independent experiments. These experiments were repeated in triplicate using a 10-fold lower concentration of anti-MDR1 peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate. As expected based on previous studies (12Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D.S. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), there was a much weaker impact on P-glycoprotein levels as measured by flow cytometry and on MDR1 message levels measured by DNA array analysis (data not shown). Likewise there were fewer substantial changes in message levels of non-target genes with only 6 of the 24 genes previously identified as responsive to peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates showing changes that fit our criteria. Thus, there seem to be clear-cut dose-response relationships in this system for both the target gene and non-target genes. DNA array technology gives the opportunity for simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes. However, because of the global character of this type of analysis and the possibility of errors, array data need to be confirmed by other independent approaches. To provide verification of the changes in message levels seen in the array analysis we performed Northern blots. Four different genes were chosen including MDR1, the target gene, β-actin as a “housekeeping gene” control, and two of the genes that responded significantly to treatment with peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates. According to the array data, leukocyte tyrosine kinase expression was predicted to be decreased by exposure to Ant 20 but not other treatments, whereas protein kinase C α was predicted to be increased by exposure to either Ant 20 or Ant 20 mismatch. As seen in Fig. 3,A–D, the Northern blot data confirmed the array analysis. Thus MDR1 and leukocyte tyrosine kinase message levels were decreased by exposure to Ant 20, whereas PKCα was increased by treatment with either conjugate. Actin message levels remained approximately constant. The magnitude of the decrease in MDR1 mRNA detected by Northern blotting, as well as the change in the level of P-glycoprotein (Fig.1), were both about 4–5-fold, although the DNA array results (Fig. 2) indicated an average MDR1 message reduction of 3-fold. This seems a reasonable level of agreement given the very divergent assays used. The experiments reported above have dealt with peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates or “free” peptide. However, one might ask whether the observed effects might be different if free antisense oligonucleotide was used instead. To address this issue, a 20-mer anti-MDR1 oligonucleotide was delivered to cells using a “scrape-loading” process (16Sazani P. Kang S.H. Maier M.A. Wei C. Dillman J. Summerton J. Manoharan M. Kole R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3965-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This resulted in effective reduction in P-glycoprotein levels, similar to that attained with the anti-MDR1 peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (evaluated by flow cytometry, data not shown). The same criteria were then used in these experiments, as in the experiments with peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates, to identify additional genes that we deemed to display significant changes in mRNA levels (Fig. 4). Interestingly, of the 24 genes whose mRNA levels were affected by the anti-MDR1 conjugate (see Table II), 10 were also affected by free antisense oligonucleotide delivered by scrape loading. The effects on these 10 genes likely represent actions of the antisense oligonucleotide moiety itself; conversely, effects on the other 14 genes probably are due to joint actions of the oligonucleotide and its associated delivery peptide. Thus, our observations indicate that there can be distinct effects on non-target genes because of the oligonucleotide alone, the delivery peptide alone, or the peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate. In an attempt to better understand the basis of the observed changes in message levels upon treatment, the non-target genes were analyzed for possible direct interactions with the oligonucleotides used in this study. The complete sequences of all the genes that showed substantial changes in expression were recovered from the NCBI Draft Human Genome data base. The Vector NTI program was used in the Analyze Oligo Duplexes mode to compare possible expressed sequences with the sequence of the MDR1 antisense or mismatched oligonucleotides. Although no precise complementarities were observed, three of the genes whose message levels were reduced by both anti-MDR1 peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate and by scrape loading free anti-MDR1 oligonucleotide showed 75–80% complementarity, with predicted melting temperatures at or above physiological levels (Fig. 5). Thus these messages could potentially be targets for true antisense action. However, the lack of complementarity in many of the affected genes suggests that most of the observed changes in message levels in non-target genes were because of indirect effects of the oligonucleotides on cellular regulatory processes rather than to sequence-specific complexation with the mRNAs. Such indirect effects might include interactions with certain proteins in particular signaling and/or transcriptional regulation pathways. Current results indicate that treatment of cells with peptide-antisense oligonucleotide conjugates can cause both specific reduction in the target mRNA as well as increases or decreases in a number of irrelevant mRNAs. These results buttress the concept that antisense experiments must be interpreted cautiously. However, our results do not negate the value of antisense as an experimental tool or a possible therapeutic approach. For several reasons, the results presented here may reflect an unusually high degree of nonspecific effects. First, because the MDR1 gene is a challenging target for antisense inhibition (20Alahari S.K. Dean N.M. Fisher M.H. Delong R. Manoharan M. Tivel K.L. Juliano R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 808-819PubMed Google Scholar), we used rather high (μm) levels of oligonucleotide conjugates. In some other cases effects of comparable magnitude on the target gene have been obtained with much lower (nm) levels of antisense oligonucleotide (21Baker B.F. Lot S.S. Condon T.P. Cheng-Flournoy S. Lesnik E.A. Sasmor H.M. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11994-12000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); this would tend to reduce nonspecific interactions. Second, current studies involved phosphorothioate oligonucleotides; these are known to have substantially more nonspecific binding to proteins (22Brown D.A. Kang S.H. Gryaznov S.M. DeDionisio L. Heidenreich O. Sullivan S., Xu, X. Nerenberg M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26801-26805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) than newer chemical forms of oligonucleotides (23Agrawal S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and thus a greater propensity for nonspecific effects (24Giles R.V. Tidd D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, one should consider that, even in the present case, only 2% of the tested genes showed changes in message levels that were deemed to be significant according to our criteria, whereas most genes were not significantly affected. Thus it seems that antisense oligonucleotides can have substantial, though not perfect, selectivity as reagents for gene regulation. It is interesting to note that the observations presented here provide quite a different picture than that resulting from another recent study of antisense effects using DNA array analysis (25Cho Y.S. Meyoung-Kon K. Cheadle C. Neary C. Becker K.G. Cho-Chung Y.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9819-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In that study antisense oligonucleotides were targeted to the message for one of the subunits of protein kinase A, a key growth regulatory protein. In addition to changes in PKA RIα subunit expression, many other changes in gene expression were observed as well as changes in cell growth; however, these were interpreted as being “downstream” of the effects on PKA. In our studies the levels of peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates used have no effect on cell growth (26Astriab-Fisher A. Sergueev D. Fisher M. Shaw B.R. Juliano R.L. Pharm. Res. 2002; 19: 744-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and thus the effects we see on non-target genes likely represent nonspecific actions of the antisense molecules rather than action on a coordinated growth regulatory program. In summary, our results indicate that peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates, as well as unconjugated oligonucleotides, can have both specific antisense effects on target genes as well as significant nonspecific effects on irrelevant genes. These results do not contravene the utility of antisense as a research tool or treatment modality. However, proper interpretation of antisense studies should include the best tools available for evaluating selectivity; clearly DNA arrays will be important in that regard."

J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Numerous other agents that are released from mitochondria as a result of Bax translocation have been identified as potential mediators of caspase-independent cell death pathways (7Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), although their role in neuronal cell death is poorly understood. Moreover, the mechanism by which p53 activation leads to Bax translocation is not known. Although Bax expression can be up-regulated at the transcriptional level by p53, we and others have shown that DNA damaging agents result in Bax translocation without causing a significant increase in the levels of Bax protein in cultured postnatal cortical neurons (2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Johnson M.D. Xiang H. London S. Kinoshita Y. Knudson M.

Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, additional mechanisms must exist that link p53 activation to Bax translocation. Identification of molecules that serve as intermediaries between p53 and Bax would increase our understanding of neuronal death mechanisms and possibly provide new therapeutic targets. One such candidate molecule is Peg3/Pw1, a protein that was originally identified as being involved in the development of the myogenic and neuronal lineages (9Relaix F. Weng X. Marazzi G. Yang E. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Spence S.E. Sassoon D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Peg3/Pw1 is thought to be a multifunctional protein with primarily nuclear localization (9Relaix F. Weng X. Marazzi G. Yang E. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Spence S.E. Sassoon D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Kohda T. Asai A. Kuroiwa Y. Kobayashi S. Aisaka K. Nagashima G. Yoshida M.C. Kondo Y. Kagiyama N. Kirino T. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The protein contains 12 putative Kruppel-type zinc finger DNA-binding domains, an RER protein interaction domain, and two proline-rich repeat domains, suggesting that Peg3/Pw1 may act as a transcription factor (9Relaix F.

ThePeg3/Pw1 gene is an imprinted gene that is expressed ubiquitously from the paternal allele in embryos, and mRNA hybridization studies in mouse and human tissues suggest that it is expressed at highest levels in the ovary, placenta, testis, and brain (9Relaix F.

Surani M.A. Genomics. 2000; 63: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms with differential localization have been identified in humans, although only a single isoform has been reported in mice (14Murphy S.K. Wylie A.A. Jirtle R.L. Genomics. 2001; 71: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Peg3/Pw1 is highly conserved between mouse and human, suggesting an important and conserved function throughout evolution (12Kim J. Ashworth L. Branscomb E. Stubbs L. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Disruption of the paternal allele of mousePeg3/Pw1 results in behavioral abnormalities, growth retardation, and alterations in the number of oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus (15Li L. Keverne E.B. Aparicio S.A. Ishino F. Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Science. 1999; 284: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). More recently, Peg3/Pw1 was identified as a gene product that is specifically expressed in fibroblasts undergoing p53-mediated apoptosis when compared with cells undergoing p53-mediated growth arrest (16Relaix F. Wei X., Li, W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,17Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that it may cooperate with another p53-regulated gene product, Siah1, to mediate Bax translocation and cell death in a fibroblast cell line (16Relaix F. Wei X., Li, W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In neurons, Peg3/Pw1 expression is up-regulated in vivo and in vitro by hypoxia (18Yamaguchi A. Taniguchi M. Hori O. Ogawa S. Tojo N. Matsuoka N. Miyake Si S. Kasai K. Sugimoto H. Tamatani M. Yamashita T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 623-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This observation is of interest because of evidence suggesting that neuronal death occurring after hypoxic insults is p53-dependent (19Banasiak K.J. Haddad G.G. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Watanabe H. Ohta S. Kumon Y. Sakaki S. Sakanaka M. Brain Res. 1999; 837: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the putative role of Peg3/Pw1 in p53-mediated apoptosis in fibroblasts and neurons, we have chosen to examine its role in p53-mediated neuronal cell death occurring after DNA damage. We report here that Peg3/Pw1 is up-regulated after DNA damage in neurons in a p53-dependent manner. Enforced overexpression of Peg3/Pw1 protein leads to decreased neuronal viability, an effect that is abrogated by deletion of either the p53 or Baxgenes. Moreover, overexpression of a Peg3/Pw1 dominant negative protein (Peg3-DN) containing a truncated C terminus inhibits both Bax translocation and neuronal death occurring after DNA damage. These findings suggest that Peg3/Pw1 acts as a mediator between p53 and Bax in a neuronal death pathway that is activated by DNA damage. Primary neuronal cell cultures derived from wild-type, p53-deficient, or Bax-deficient animals were used for this study. p53 wild-type and knockout mice on a C57BL/6 X 129 SV background were generated as previously described (21Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery C.A., Jr. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). Bax knockout mice were generated from a 129/Sv x C3H background as previously described (22Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). The genotypes of the mating pairs and all offspring were determined by PCR using DNA extracted from the tail as previously described (23Timme T.L. Thompson T.C. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 460-463PubMed Google Scholar, 24Deckwerth T.L. Elliott J.L. Knudson C.M. Johnson E.M., Jr. Snider W.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Primary neuronal cultures were established from newborn mouse cortex as described previously (1Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical tissue was excised, trypsinized, and dissociated by trituration to obtain single cells. Cells were then plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated cultureware and maintained in neurobasal medium with B27 supplements (Invitrogen). Under these conditions, cultures were shown to contain greater than 95% neurons using neurofilament immunostaining techniques (1Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained for 4 days prior to experimental manipulations. Non-replicative recombinant adenovirus deleted in the E1 region and carrying the human p53 gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was generated as previously described (25Zhang W.W. Fang X. Branch C.D. Mazur W. French B.A. Roth J.A. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 868-872PubMed Google Scholar) and was the generous gift of Dr. Toshiyoshi Fujiwara (Okayama University Medical School, Japan). Non-replicative recombinant adenovirus deleted in the E1 region and carrying the AxCALacZ β-galactosidase gene was generated as described previously (26Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Drs. Saito and Kanegae (University of Tokyo, Japan). Adenoviruses were propagated in E1 complementing human embryonic kidney 293 cells, purified, and used as described in our previous publications (1Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An multiplicity of infection of 125 (a titer that did not produce significant toxicity alone) was used for these studies. The transduction efficiency using this method exceeded 90%, as described previously (1Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons in dissociated cell culture were washed in PBS1 and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed 3 times in PBS (pH 7.4), and blocked in blocking buffer containing the appropriate blocking serum for 1 h. The cultures were incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The cultures were then washed in PBS 3 times and incubated for 2 h in secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Peg3/Pw1 immunocytochemistry was performed using a mouse monoclonal anti-Peg3/Pw1 antibody at a 1:50 dilution, 2X. Wu, unpublished data. followed by a goat anti-mouse Alexa 594-labeled secondary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent microscopic images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert deconvolution microscope equipped with emission and excitation filter wheels and a cooled CCD camera (Cooke Corp., Auburn Hills, MI). Fluorescent intensity comparisons were made using images obtained with identical exposure time and normalized on the same pixel intensity distribution. All images were deconvolved and/or analyzed using Slidebook image analysis software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). An expression construct encoding Bax fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) was created using full-length human Bax cDNA inserted into the vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (27Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) and generously supplied by Dr. R. Youle (Bethesda, MD). The EGFP-Peg3/Pw1 vector was constructed by fusing the full-length Peg3/Pw1 coding sequence in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of EGFP in pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) as described previously (17Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant form of Peg3/Pw1 (Peg3-DN, amino acids 1–592) containing a COOH-terminal truncation has been described previously (28Relaix F. Wei X.J., Wu, X. Sassoon D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The vectors were amplified in TOP 10F′ bacteria using a standard protocol. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 μg of vector DNA diluted in 20 μl of Opti-MEM was incubated for 20 min with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent diluted in 80 μl of Opti-MEM. This mixture was then diluted to 450 μl with neurobasal medium and added to neuronal cultures for a 4–6-h incubation period. Cells were then washed and again placed into neurobasal growth medium. Transfected cells were viewed using fluorescein isothiocyanate epifluorescence. The transfection efficiency using this method was ∼2–5%. The Peg3-DN (amino acids 1–592) vector was used in transient co-transfection experiments. Peg3-DN DNA was co-transfected with either EGFP or EGFP-Bax DNA in a 7:3 ratio using the method described above, such that the total amount of transfected DNA was 2 μg. Cultured cells were collected by scraping in ice-cold PBS and spun down as previously described (2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots for Peg3/Pw1 were performed as described previously (17Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Relaix F. Wei X.J., Wu, X. Sassoon D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Peg3/Pw1 in p53-mediated neuronal cell death, we examined Peg3/Pw1 expression in cultured primary mouse cortical neurons under control conditions and after genotoxic or excitotoxic injury. Primary cortical neurons were obtained from newborn mice and maintained in dissociated cell culture for 4 days in a chemically defined medium. The cells were then exposed to camptothecin (2.5 μm), glutamate (50 μm), or vehicle control. After 18 h, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained for Peg3/Pw1 immunoreactivity using a mouse monoclonal anti-Peg3/Pw1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, there was a low but significant level of Peg3/Pw1 immunoreactivity present in cultured mouse cortical neurons under control conditions. This finding is in agreement with observations on the expression of Peg3/Pw1 mRNA and protein in mouse brain in vivo (10Kohda T. Asai A. Kuroiwa Y. Kobayashi S. Aisaka K. Nagashima G. Yoshida M.C. Kondo Y. Kagiyama N. Kirino T. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Keverne E.B. Aparicio S.A. Ishino F. Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Science. 1999; 284: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). After DNA damage, a significant increase in Peg3/Pw1 immunoreactivity was observed. Interestingly, glutamate exposure, which is thought to activate both p53-dependent and p53-independent cell death pathways (2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), failed to increase Peg3/Pw1 immunoreactivity significantly. The differential induction of Peg3/Pw1 expression that was noted between glutamate and camptothecin parallels a similar differential induction of Bax protein and caspase activity caused by these agents in cultured postnatal cortical neurons (2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of Peg3/Pw1 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). Primary cortical neurons were treated with camptothecin (2.5 μm) for 6 h, and protein extracts were then collected and analyzed by Western blot as described. A 2-fold increase in Peg3/Pw1 protein was observed 6 h after camptothecin exposure. This increase was persistent, and was also observed after 18 h of camptothecin exposure (see Fig.3 A). Thus, both immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis indicated that Peg3/Pw1 protein levels were increased in primary cortical neurons after DNA damage. To determine the effect of increased Peg3/Pw1 expression on neuronal viability, primary mouse cortical neurons were transfected with a vector containing Peg3/Pw1 fused to green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-Peg3/Pw1) in a transient transfection assay. Control cells were transfected with a vector containing only pEGFP. After 72 h, the cultures were examined for the presence of fluorescent cells expressing either the Peg3/Pw1-GFP fusion protein or the GFP control protein. Approximately 5% of the neurons were noted to express GFP (as indicated by the presence of green fluorescence) in control cultures. The EGFP-transfected cells showed the extensive dendritic and axonal outgrowth typical of mouse cortical neurons cultured under these conditions (Fig.2 A). In contrast, most neurons overexpressing the Peg3/Pw1-GFP fusion protein displayed a small, rounded morphology with short, abortive neuritic processes. Co-staining of fixed neurons with Hoechst dye to identify the nucleus confirmed that the overexpressed Peg3/Pw1-GFP protein was primarily nuclear in its location (data not shown), although some expression in the cytoplasm was observed. When measured at either 24 or 72 h, the mean number of neurons per high power field expressing the Peg3/Pw1-GFP fusion protein was significantly less than the mean number of neurons expressing either GFP or a COOH terminus truncated Peg3/Pw1 dominant negative protein (0.6 versus 7.0 versus 6.9,p < 0.003, after 72 h, paired t test). More importantly, the percent decline in the mean number of transfected neurons observed between 24 and 72 h was greater in the EGFP-Peg3/Pw1-transfected cultures (75%) than in the control EGFP-transfected cultures (11%) or the Peg3/Pw1-DN-transfected cultures (13%). Thus, these findings indicated that overexpression of Peg3/Pw1 in primary mouse cortical neurons resulted in a progressive decline in neuronal viability. To determine whether Peg3/Pw1 is required for execution of the neuronal death pathway activated by DNA damage, wild-type neurons were transfected with a Peg3/Pw1-DN vector (amino acids 1–592) which encodes a COOH terminus truncated Peg3/Pw1 protein (28Relaix F. Wei X.J., Wu, X. Sassoon D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This protein lacks 8 of the 12 zinc finger domains and both of the His-Pro repeat domains, but retains the RER protein-interaction domain. This Peg3/Pw1-DN protein has been previously shown to inhibit Peg3/Pw1-mediated NF-κB activation, Peg3/Pw1-mediated apoptosis, and Peg3/Pw1-mediated Bax translocation in fibroblasts (16Relaix F. Wei X., Li, W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Relaix F. Wei X.J., Wu, X. Sassoon D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The EGFP vector was co-transfected with the Peg3/Pw1-DN vector to facilitate the identification of transfected cells. Control cultures were transfected with the EGFP vector alone. Approximately 24 h after transfection, the cultures were exposed to camptothecin (2.5 μm) for an additional 18 h. Transfected cells were then examined under fluorescence and counted to assess overall survival. In some cases, transfected neurons were fixed and counterstained with Hoechst dye to identify apoptotic nuclei with condensed chromatin. As shown in Fig.3 A, transfected neurons expressing the GFP control vector showed marked somatic disruption and neurite degeneration after camptothecin exposure, characteristic of neurons undergoing DNA damage-induced cell death. In contrast, most neurons expressing the Peg3/Pw1-DN protein and exposed to camptothecin retained an intact soma and extensive neuritic outgrowth similar to untreated neurons. Quantitative analysis (Fig. 3 B) indicated that a greater percentage of Peg3/Pw1-DN-expressing neurons displayed healthy appearing nuclei and neurites after camptothecin-induced DNA damage than was observed among control GFP-expressing neurons exposed to camptothecin (78% versus 44%, p < 0.05, paired t test). Moreover, the number of viable neurons expressing GFP alone declined by 87% after camptothecin treatment (n = 103), but the number of viable cells expressing the Peg3/Pw1-DN protein was not significantly different after camptothecin exposure than that observed under control conditions (n = 98). Thus, inhibition of Peg3/Pw1 activity by overexpression of the Peg3/Pw1-DN protein significantly inhibited neuronal death after DNA damage. We have previously shown that neuronal death after DNA damage requires the presence of a functional p53 protein (1Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Johnson M.D. Xiang H. London S. Kinoshita Y. Knudson M. Mayberg M. Korsmeyer S.J. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed increase in Peg3/Pw1 expression after DNA damage was p53-dependent, primary cortical neurons derived from wild-type or p53-deficient mice were exposed to camptothecin for 18 h. The protein was then collected and analyzed by Western blot for Peg3/Pw1 expression. Protein extracts from control (vehicle treated) neurons were also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Peg3/Pw1 expression was up-regulated in wild-type, but not in p53-deficient neurons exposed to camptothecin. Thus, a functional p53 protein is required for Peg3/Pw1 induction after DNA damage in neurons. Studies in fibroblasts containing a temperature-sensitive mutant form of p53 indicated that p53 expression alone was insufficient to induce Peg3/Pw1 expression (16Relaix F. Wei X., Li, W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was also true in neurons, we transduced cultured mouse cortical neurons with an adenovirus containing either the p53 gene or the LacZβ-galactosidase gene as a control. After ∼60 h, the cultures were fixed and stained for Peg3/Pw1 immunoreactivity as described. Up-regulation of p53 protein expression after transduction with the p53 adenovirus was confirmed by Western blot (data not shown). No increase in Peg3/Pw1 immunoreactivity was observed in p53-transduced cultures when compared with the β-galactosidase-transduced cultures (Fig.4 B). These data are consistent with observations in fibroblasts indicating that up-regulation of p53 alone is insufficient to induce Peg3/Pw1 expression (16Relaix F. Wei X., Li, W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that p53 is necessary, but not sufficient for Peg3/Pw1 induction after DNA damage in neurons. Although p53 was required for Peg3/Pw1 induction in neurons after DNA damage, we wondered whether enforced overexpression of Peg3/Pw1 could nevertheless mediate neuronal death in the absence of p53. To investigate this possibility, primary cortical neurons derived from wild-type or p53-deficient mice were transfected with the EGFP-Peg3/Pw1 vector, and the cultures were then examined after either 24 or 48 h to determine the number of transfected neurons that survived. As shown in Fig. 4 C, Peg3/Pw1 overexpression significantly decreased neuronal survival in wild-type, but not in p53-deficient neurons at both time points. A statistically significant decline in the number of transfected cells per high powered field was noted in the wild-type, but not in the p53-deficient cultures over the 48-h observation period. Thus, a functional p53 protein is required for Peg3/Pw1-mediated neuronal death, even when Peg3/Pw1 expression is increased by other means. We have previously shown that neuronal death after DNA damage requires the presence of a functional Bax protein (2Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J.

Several reports indicate that Bax translocation is an important step in the genesis of mitochondrial dysfunction and programmed cell death under numerous circumstances (29Xiang J. Chao D.T.

By using an oligonucleotide system containing such repeats, we recapitulated the last steps in Okazaki fragment processing, which have been implicated in sequence expansion. A template containing either triplet or tandem repeats was annealed to a downstream primer containing complementary repeats at its 5′-end. Overlapping upstream primers, designed to strand-displace varying numbers of repeats in the downstream primer, were annealed. Human DNA ligase I joined overlapping segments of repeats generating an expansion product from the primer strands. Joining efficiency decreased with repeat length.

However, both expanded and non-expanded products formed irrespective of relative nuclease and ligase concentrations tested or enzyme addition order, suggesting the pre-existence and persistence of intermediates leading to both outcomes.

Examination of expansion in vitro enables dissection of substrate and replication enzyme dynamics on repeat sequences. flap endonuclease 1 nucleotide tandem repeat Sites in which mono- to pentanucleotide DNA sequences are repeated are widespread in the chromosomes of organisms from bacteria to humans. These microsatellite repeats range from tens to hundreds of base pairs in length (1Bennett P. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 53: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Typically repeat sequences are highly polymorphic, and the number of repeats at specific sites varies extensively. These segments of repeats are inherently unstable and undergo sequence expansions and deletions. Especially interesting are triplet repeat sequences, because only 3 of the 10 possible triplet repeats (CAG, CGG, and GAA) are prone to expansion (2Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Propensity for expansion generally increases with the size of the repeat region, and expansion can range from addition of a few repeats to thousands (3Usdin K. Grabczyk E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 914-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, the rate and size of sequence expansions vary between and within tissues of organisms (4Fortune M.T. Vassilopoulos C. Coolbaugh M.I. Siciliano M.J. Monckton D.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of sequence expansion have attracted much attention because of the involvement of triplet repeat expansion in the pathogenesis of at least 11 neurological disorders (3Usdin K. Grabczyk E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 914-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in yeast and E. coli suggest that one mechanism of expansion involves slipped mispairing of template and primer strands within the repeat region during DNA replication or repair (5Ohshima K. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Rolfsmeier M.L. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such mispairing results in formation of a loop in one strand of the helix. Looping of the template strand during replication of the leading or lagging strand would lead to deletion, whereas that in the primer strand would result in expansion. Triplet repeats have been shown to be inherently flexible and mispair to form slipped DNA intermediates (7Chastain P.D. Sinden R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Pearson C.E. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Sinden R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Additionally, the quasi-palindromic nature of triplet repeats results in the formation of stable hairpins, bubbles, and other unconventional helical structures (Refs. 3Usdin K. Grabczyk E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 914-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 9Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and references therein). These structures in the repeat sequences could serve as substrates for ligation-mediated expansions during discontinuous synthesis of lagging strand. Normally, bubble structures and hairpin loops in the genome are repaired by the mismatch repair system. The role for this repair pathway in sequence expansion is not clear. Hairpin loops containing repeat sequences were found to be resistant to mismatch repair in yeast, suggesting that their persistence contributes to expansion (10Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C.P. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although in yeast mismatch repair might offer some protection from expansion (11Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1501-1507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), data from mouse models and Escherichia colisuggest that initiation of mismatch repair can result in expansion (12Jaworski A. Rosche W.A. Gellibolian R. Kang S. Shimizu M. Bowater R.P. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11019-11023Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Manley K.

Genet. 2000; 9: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another factor influencing expansions is the orientation of the repeat sequences relative to the origin of replication. Both CAG and CGG repeat sequences exhibit greater instability when present on the lagging strand template and are prone to expansion (15Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Miret J.J. Pessoa-Brandao L. Lahue R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This links steps unique to discontinuous lagging strand synthesis with one or more mechanisms of sequence expansion. A model proposed by Gordenin et al. (18Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) suggests how expansion might occur during Okazaki fragment processing. To join the fragments generated during lagging strand synthesis, the RNA primer at the 5′-end is strand-displaced by a DNA polymerase synthesizing an upstream primer. This leads to the generation of a 5′-flap structure that is cleaved by the flap endonuclease (FEN1),1 following that the nick is sealed by a DNA ligase to generate a contiguous daughter strand (19Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Such strand displacement in triplet repeat regions would result in formation of flaps containing repeat sequences that form stable secondary structures and are resistant to cleavage by FEN1. Persistence of such flaps then leads to re-equilibration of the flap to form loops and bubbles. Sealing of these structures by DNA ligase will expand the daughter strand. This model implies that defective or inefficient processing of flaps by FEN1 is a major pathway for expansion (20Kokoska R.J. Stefanovic L. Tran H.T. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Moreover, triplet repeats appear to form structures that make them uniquely prone to expansion (20Kokoska R.J. Stefanovic L. Tran H.T. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D.

We describe here a model that enables us to study the components of repeat expansion, i.e. the repeat sequence and its interaction with the replication and repair machinery in vitro. Specifically, this system represents the last steps of Okazaki fragment processing across a region containing repeat sequences. The substrate has the flap structure produced at the 5′-ends of Okazaki fragments just prior to the action of FEN1 nuclease. Cleavage by FEN1 results in proper processing generating a nick suitable for DNA ligase I leading to a product of correct length. However, the 5′-flap can equilibrate with the template into a variety of intermediate structures. Those substrates forming nicks can be captured directly by DNA ligase and joined to expand the sequence. Use of this system has allowed us to determine the properties of the repeat substrate that promote expansion and to determine how these properties might circumvent the characteristics of the replication enzymes that have evolved to replicate DNA accurately. Oligonucleotides were synthesized either by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Radionucleotides [α-32P]dCTP (3000–6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained form PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase and Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (labeling grade) were from Roche Diagnostics. Recombinant human FEN1 cloned into the pET-FCH expression vector was expressed and purified from E. coli as reported previously (24Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. The cDNA for human DNA ligase I was PCR-amplified from the vector pTD-T7N (25Teraoka H. Minami H. Iijima S. Tsukada K. Koiwai O. Date T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with PCR primers constructed to the 5′ and 3′ termini of the gene. The resulting PCR fragment was isolated and inserted into the TA cloning vector pCR to generate pCR-hLIGI. From this vector, the cDNA was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET-15b (Novagen, WI) using a two-part strategy. First, pCR-hLIGI was digested withBamHI and EcoRI, which releases a fragment containing the 3′-portion of the gene for DNA ligase I. The fragment was isolated and inserted into pET-15b also digested withBamHI and EcoRI to generate the plasmid p15b-LIG3′. Next, the 5′-end of the cDNA for DNA ligase I was isolated from pCR-hLIGI after digestion with NdeI andBamHI and placed into p15b-LIG3′ digested with the same enzymes. The final expression vector, pHIS-hLIG1, contains the entire cDNA for human DNA ligase I with an additional His8 tag at the N terminus. DNA ligase I was expressed from pHIS-hLIG1 in E. coli BL21. Four 1-liter flasks of YT media (1 liter) were each inoculated with a single positive colony from a fresh transformant and agitated overnight at room temperature (23–25 °C). Typically, the culture reached an absorbance of 0.1 at 595 nm. Then the bacterial cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking until theA 595 was 0.6. Each culture was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 4 mm, and growth continued for an additional 3 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, lysed by sonication, and resuspended in lysis buffer (1 mg/ml lysozyme; 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 300 mm NaCl; 15% glycerol; 10 mm imidazole; 1% Nonidet P-40). A protease inhibitor mixture tablet from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (1 tablet per 10 ml of lysis buffer) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm final concentration) were added to the lysis buffer to reduce protein degradation. The resulting lysate was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation. Modifying the human DNA ligase I with a histidine tail enabled us to purify the enzyme using a two-column purification scheme. Human DNA ligase I was purified from the cell lysate using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. A 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Bio-Rad) column was equilibrated with 10-column volumes of buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 300 mm NaCl; 15% glycerol; 20 mm imidazole) and eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient of 300–600 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions were tested for DNA ligase I activity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with either Coomassie Blue or Silver. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed into Mono-Q low salt buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.6 (diluted from a 1 m stock), 50 mmNaCl, 15% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The dialyzed samples were loaded onto a 1-ml Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the low salt buffer. DNA ligase I was eluted with a 10-column volume linear salt gradient of 50–600 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Final DNA ligase I fractions were assayed for activity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with either Coomassie Blue or Silver. Activity was determined by the ability of the fraction to ligate a radiolabeled nick substrate in an ATP-dependent manner. There was no detectable contamination from any NAD-dependent ligase such as E. coli DNA ligase. Active fractions were frozen in a −80 °C freezer until use. The final fraction of peak activity contained 3.8 mg of total protein (0.9 mg/liter of induced culture) at greater than 85% purity. We found the His-tagged enzyme to have properties indistinguishable from the unmodified enzyme (data not shown). Oligonucleotides were designed to mimic the last steps of Okazaki fragment processing. Each substrate consisted of a template strand annealed with a downstream primer at its 5′-end and an upstream primer at its 3′-end. The sequences of oligonucleotides used are listed in Table I. The template and downstream primers contained either triplet or tandem repeats, having complete complementarity. The triplet repeat substrates contained 10 CTG/CAG repeats, whereas the tandem repeat substrates contained three 10-nucleotide direct repeats. Both substrates contained approximately the same percentage of GC content. After the template-downstream pair was annealed, upstream primers containing varying number of repeats were added to complete the substrate. The (CTG)1, (CTG)3, and (CTG)10 substrates each contained either 1, 3, or 10 CTG repeats at the 3′-ends within the upstream primer. Similarly, substrates (TR)1, (TR)2, and (TR)3 contained one, two, or three 10-nucleotide repeats at the 3′-end of the upstream primer. In the final substrate, the upstream and downstream primers contain sequences complementary to the template. These overlapping regions should result in a dynamic equilibrium between the primers. This would produce intermediates involving strand displacement of one primer to form a flap and bubble structures involving one or both primers. “Nick” substrates that lacked either the CTG or tandem repeat were used with each set of substrates to monitor the efficiency of ligation.Table IOligonucleotide sequencesOligonuceotides are aligned with upstream and downstream primers listed 5′ to 3′ and templates T(CTG)10 and T(TR)3listed 3′ to 5′.

Nucleotides involved in either CTG or 10 nucleotide repeats are shown in bold. Prior to annealing, the downstream primer was radiolabeled at its 3′-end. The downstream primer (10 pmol) was annealed to template T1 (25 pmol) generating a recessed 3′-end and then was extended with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow polymerase at 37 °C for 3 h. Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed using Micro Bio-spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The labeled downstream primer was isolated and purified on a 10% 7 murea-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Substrates were generated by annealing the downstream primer, template, and upstream primer at a molar ratio of 1:2:4, respectively. Downstream and template primers were diluted into 50 μl of TE (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA) and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction was placed at 70 °C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Next, the appropriate upstream primer was added and the reaction incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. Assays contained the indicated amounts of substrate, DNA ligase I, and/or FEN1 in reaction buffer in a final volume of 20 μl. Reaction buffer contained 30 mm HEPES, pH 8.0 (diluted from a 1 m stock), 40 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% inositol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Assays were assembled on ice and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of termination dye (95% formamide (v)/v, 1 mm EDTA with 0.5% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel and detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitation was done using ImageQuant version 1.2 software from Molecular Dynamics. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. We describe here an in vitro system designed to model mechanisms of sequence expansion during mammalian lagging strand DNA synthesis. We have used this system to explore the roles of DNA substrate structure and two enzymes central to Okazaki fragment processing, namely FEN1 and DNA ligase I. An important feature of the system is that oligonucleotide primers are annealed in an overlapping configuration to simulate the displacement of the 5′-end of an Okazaki fragment by synthesis extending an upstream fragment. Addition of FEN1 and DNA ligase I reconstitutes removal of the overlap and joining of the fragments. Fig. 1 gives a schematic view of the substrates used in this study. A template strand (T) containing either 10 CAG repeats or three 10-bp tandem repeat sequences flanked by unique sequences was annealed with a downstream primer (D). The downstream primer annealed with full complementarity up to the 5′-end of the template. The downstream primer was just long enough to be complementary to all of the repeat sequences in the template. An upstream primer (U), also fully complementary to the 3′-end to the template, was then annealed. For some substrates the upstream primer extended from the 3′-end of the template up to the downstream primer to form a nick. This upstream primer had no repeat sequences. For other substrates the upstream primer was extended with one triplet repeat sequence [(CTG)1]. Such a primer would be fully complementary to the 3′-end of the template but would overlap three nucleotides with the downstream primer. Similarly, other substrates had upstream primers extended with 3 [(CTG)3] or 10 triplet repeats [(CTG)10]. A similar set of primers containing three tandem repeats of 10 nucleotides was also constructed. For the tandem repeat substrates we overlapped one, two, or three tandem repeat units on the upstream and downstream primers to generate the (TR)1, (TR)2, and (TR)3substrates. Overlap of the upstream and downstream primer will result in partial strand displacement of the downstream primer off the template producing a 5′-flap structure similar to that proposed to form during initiator RNA removal and joining of Okazaki fragments (19Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, as the substrates contain repeat sequences, the upstream and downstream primers can also form alternate structures by slippage and mis-pairing, equilibrating between these structures as represented in Fig. 1. In this manner, the oligonucleotide system we describe here is dynamic, recreating the structures that can form when repeat sequences overlapin vivo. Formation of bubble intermediates with juxtaposed 5′- and 3′-ends produces a substrate, which if ligated would expand the region of repeat sequences. However, intermediates with 5′-flaps can serve as substrates for FEN1. Complete processing by FEN1 prior to ligation will result in maintenance in the number of repeats spanning the region. We first determined whether DNA ligase I can mediate repeat expansion. Varying amounts of DNA ligase I were incubated with substrates having overlapping primers containing repeated sequences. Downstream primers were radiolabeled at their 3′-ends to facilitate detection and size determination of ligation products by electrophoresis (Fig.2, A and B). Remarkably, the (CTG)1, (CTG)3, (TR)1, and (TR)2 substrates with 1 and 3 units of CTG overlaps and up to 2 units of overlapping 10-bp tandem repeat segments, respectively, were readily joined to generate expansion products incorporating the length of the upstream overlap (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes 6–8 and10–12). This indicates that sequences containing repeats indeed equilibrate into bubble intermediates that are accessible for joining and expansion by DNA ligase I. However, longer overlaps of 30 bp in (CTG)10 and (TR)3 substrates either failed to ligate or formed expanded sequences at very low levels (lanes 14–16). This decrease could derive from a drop in the proportion of expansion substrate intermediates accessible to DNA ligase I formed in the substrate population. The potential flap and bubble intermediate structures that can form with increasing length of overlap rises enormously. However, it is conceivable that with increasing length of the overlap either the bubble intermediates formed are unstable or have a bulky structure that can interfere with the activity of DNA ligase I. Another possible reason for the lack of expansion of long triplet and tandem repeat overlaps is the formation of cruciform intermediates in which the overlapping repeat sequences in the two primers interact to form a branching helix. This intermediate also would be inaccessible to DNA ligase I. Strand displacement of the downstream primer by the upstream primer should result in the generation of a 5′-flap that is the substrate for endonucleolytic cleavage by FEN1 (26Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of this enzyme to cleave repeat sequence overlaps over time. FEN1 cleaved (CTG)1, (CTG)3, and (TR)1 substrates very rapidly. More than 80% of these substrates was cleaved in 3 min at the employed level of FEN1 (Fig. 3, A andB) suggesting that smaller repeat overlaps formed flaps readily. However, with (CTG)10, (TR)2, and (TR)3 substrates only 40% of the total substrate was cleaved. Results published previously (27Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) show that increasing the flap length with random sequences does not affect the activity of FEN1. However, fold backs and secondary structures in the flap inhibit cleavage (24Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1079-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, FEN1 was likely inhibited because repeat sequences with increased length interacted inter- and intramolecularly to form secondary structures that were refractory to FEN1 cleavage. FEN1 has been implicated in repeat sequence expansion as yeast rad27Δ strains exhibited increased expansion of triplet repeat tracts (22Schweitzer J.K. Livingston D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23White P.J. Borts R.H. Hirst M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Ireland M.J. Reinke S.S. Livingston D.M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of FEN1 to inhibit sequence expansion on repeat substrates in vitro. FEN1 was added to reactions containing the various repeat substrates and DNA ligase I. With increasing amounts of FEN1, expansion by direct joining of upstream and downstream primers decreased (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 11–14 and18–21). Furthermore, there was an increase in the product expected from cleavage of the longest flap formed by strand displacement of the overlapping repeats, followed by sealing of the resultant nick by DNA ligase I (63 nt for CTG and 69 nt for tandem repeat substrate). This complete processing of the substrate by FEN1 followed by ligation results in maintenance within the joined primers of the repeat length present in the template. Remarkably, formation of expansion products persists even at the highest levels of FEN1 used in this assay. This suggests that some bubble intermediates formed by the repeat substrates were stable and inaccessible to FEN1. This also suggests that the presence of FEN1 is unable to drive the equilibration of the repeat substrate fully into the flap intermediate. As with the experiment containing DNA ligase I alone, there was no formation of maximum length expansion products from the (CTG)10 and (TR)3 substrates (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 25–28), although they readily formed products that result from proper processing of the overlapping flaps. However, the amount of substrate reacted was significantly lower than with the smaller substrates. This is consistent with an inhibition of FEN1 activity by structures that the longer flaps can form. Curiously, a small proportion of (CTG)10, (TR)2, and (TR)3substrates formed products of intermediate expansion lengths (72–90 nt for the (CTG)10 substrate and 79 and 89 nt for the (TR)2 and (TR)3 substrates) in the presence of FEN1 and DNA ligase I. These products correspond to the processing of an intermediate in which the substrate forms both a bubble and a short flap. Cleavage of the short flap and ligation then would yield an expansion product but not one of the maximum possible expansion length. The sizes of these intermediate expansion products vary in units of 3 nucleotides for the CTG repeat and in 10 nucleotides for the tandem repeat substrate suggesting the structure of the intermediates from which they were derived. These structures would possess bubbles on either upstream or downstream primers having a segment of the downstream primer with an integer repeat unit length in a flap that would be accessible to cleavage by FEN1. This demonstrates the ability of overlapping segments of DNA containing repeat sequence to equilibrate into intermediate structures that can then be processed to give rise to numerous incorrectly sized products. Reaction rates for direct ligation, cleavage, and ligation of cleaved substrate were compared in a reaction containing similar molar concentrations of FEN1 and DNA ligase I, or excess FEN1 over DNA ligase I, and the (CTG)3 substrate (Fig. 5,A and B). Comparing the initial rate of direct ligation to the initial rate of cleavage at 5 fmol of FEN1 and 4 fmol of DNA ligase I, it is evident that the ligase is more efficient than the nuclease at 1.25 molar ratio of FEN1 to DNA ligase I (Fig.5 A). This is evident from the ligation of cleaved product, which occurs at about the same rate as FEN1-directed cleavage, demonstrating that cleavage limits the rate of the overall reaction. Over the time course, however, the extent of both cleavage and ligation of the cleaved substrate surpasses the quantity of ligation in the reaction with ligase alone. This result suggests that the action of the nuclease generates a substrate that is favored by the ligase. In reactions c"
https://openalex.org/W2052975602,"We have reported recently that mice overexpressing the forkhead/winged helix transcription factorFOXC2 are lean and show increased responsiveness to insulin due to sensitization of the β-adrenergic cAMP-PKA+pathway and increased levels of the RIα subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Cederberg, A., Gronning, L. M., Ahren, B., Tasken, K., Carlsson, P., and Enerback, S. (2001) Cell 106, 563–573). In this present study, we reveal that FOXC2 and a related factor, FOXD1, specifically activate the 1b promoter of the RIα gene in adipocytes and testicular Sertoli cells, respectively. By deletional mapping, we discovered two different mechanisms by which the Fox proteins activated expression from the RIα1b promoter. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, an upstream region represses promoter activity under basal conditions. Bandshift experiments indicate that overexpression of FOXC2 promotes the release of a potential repressor from this region. In Sertoli cells, sequences downstream of the transcription start sites mediate the activating effect of FOXD1, and protein kinase Bα/Akt1 strongly induces this effect. Furthermore, we show that an inactive FOXD1 mutant lowers the cAMP-mediated induction of the RIα1b reporter construct. In summary, winged helix transcription factors of the FOXC/FOXD families function as regulators of the RIα subunit of PKA and may integrate hormonal signals acting through protein kinase B and cAMP in a cell-specific manner."

RT/template primer contacts have been shown to influence its fidelity and sensitivity to nucleoside analog inhibitors. The Phe61 residue, located within the β3 sheet of the finger subdomain, is highly conserved among retroviral RTs. The crystal structure of a ternary complex revealed that Phe61contacts the first and second bases of the 5′-template overhang. To determine whether such contacts influence the dNTP-binding pocket, we performed a limited vertical scanning mutagenesis (Phe → Ala, Leu, Trp, or Tyr) at Phe61. The F61A mutant displayed the highest increase in fidelity, followed by the F61L and F61W variants, which had intermediate phenotypes. F61Y RT had a minimal effect. The increase in fidelity of the F61A mutant was corroborated by a 12-fold decrease in its forward mutation rate. The Phe61mutant RTs also displayed large reductions in sensitivity to 2′,3′-dideoxythymidine triphosphate and 2′,3′-dideoxy,2′3′-didehydrothymidine triphosphate. Mutants displaying the largest increase in fidelity (F61A and F61L) were also the most resistant.

As a result, treatment consisting of the currently used drugs for treatment of AIDS inevitably leads to the emergence of resistant viruses (reviewed in Ref. 5Omrani A.S. Pillay D. J. Infect. 2000; 41: 5-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, determining viral factors that influence either the rate of viral replication or mutation continues to be of utmost importance in the further development of better antiretroviral therapies.One of the major sources of HIV-1 sequence variation is its reverse transcriptase (RT). HIV-1 RT is required to convert the HIV-1 single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded proviral DNA. The complete synthesis of proviral DNA requires a multitude of activities inherent to HIV-1 RT, including RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase ribonuclease H, strand transfer, and strand displacement synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 6Telesnitsky A. Goff G.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 121-160Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is thought to be an error-prone DNA polymerase (7Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 8Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In addition to its poor polymerase fidelity, HIV-1 RT lacks a 3′ to 5′ proofreading activity, which precludes the removal of misinserted dNTPs (8Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Even when compared with other retroviral RTs also lacking proofreading, such as avian myeloblastosis virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus RTs, HIV-1 RT is significantly more error prone (8Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 9Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the importance of the poor polymerase fidelity of HIV-1 RT in HIV-1 variation has been well known for some time, knowledge of the molecular determinants contributing to its error-prone nature is only beginning to emerge.Studies on the polymerase fidelity of HIV-1 RT have focused on two major categories of RT variants. In one class are the mutants that emerge in patients receiving therapy with NRTIs or in cell culture systems under drug pressure, and in a second are those selected via structure-based mutagenesis. Work from our laboratory and that of others have shown that a subset of mutations conferring resistance to NRTIs enhances HIV-1 RT polymerase fidelity relative to the wild type enzyme (10Drosopoulos W.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27037-27044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations that confer resistance to NRTIs, with the exception of 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-azidothymidine resistance mutations, enable RT to discriminate between a nucleoside analog inhibitor and its normal dNTP substrate. Such mutations may also allow RT to better discriminate between a correct versus an incorrect dNTP based on the geometry of the dNTP-binding pocket. This was demonstrated initially for the (−)2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine resistance mutation M184V by work previously reported from our laboratory as well as that of others (11Rubinek T. Bakhanashvili M. Taube R. Avidan O. Hizi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N.S. Modak M.J.

Prasad V.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Similarly, the multi-2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside analog-resistant variant K65R displayed a 8-fold increase in overall fidelity (16Shah F. Curr K. Parniak M. Mitsuya H. Prasad V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27037-27044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lys65 residue directly contacts the γ-phosphate of incoming dNTP, whereas the Met184 side chain contacts the sugar and the base of the 3′-nucleotide in the primer, but the substitution with a β-branched side chain such as Leu or Ile creates contact with the dNTP sugar ring as well (17Huang H. Chopra R. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Thus, the influence of these mutations on the dNTP insertion fidelity or the overall forward mutation rate can be readily appreciated.The influence of a second class of mutations on polymerase fidelity, however, appears to be indirectly mediated via contacts with the template primer duplex. One of the earliest reported examples of such mutations is the E89G substitution in the template grip β5a in the palm region. The multi-2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside analog-resistant E89G mutant RT displayed an increase in dNTP insertion fidelity (10Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rubinek T. Bakhanashvili M. Taube R. Avidan O. Hizi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Glu89 residue is known to contact the template strand at the penultimate base pair (2 bases toward the 3′ of the templating nucleotide in the duplex region) Therefore, a change in the conformation of the template primer duplex could lead to alterations in the geometry of the dNTP-binding pocket. Similarly, mutation at the residue Pro157, which contacts the same template nucleotide, conferred a sequence-specific increase in resistance to nucleoside analogs (18Klarmann G.J. Smith R.A. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 359-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additional evidence that contacts made between HIV-1 RT and the template primer affect fidelity include mutations in the fingers (R78A and D76V) and thumb (G262A and W266A) subdomains (19Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Kim B. Ayran J.C. Sagar S.G. Adman E.T. Fuller S.M. Tran N.H. Horrigan J. J. Biol.

D76V and R78A variants were selected via anEscherichia coli complementation screen and structure-based mutagenesis, and both displayed an overall fidelity 9-fold greater than wild type RT (19Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Kim B. Ayran J.C. Sagar S.G. Adman E.T. Fuller S.M. Tran N.H. Horrigan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27666-27673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Asp76 and Arg78 are H-bonded to each other, and Asp76 contacts the template nucleotide base paired to the incoming dNTP. Residues Gly262 and Trp266 constitute part of the minor groove binding track, a structural element found primarily within the αH helix of the thumb subdomain (22Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A., Li, L. Prasad R. Luton B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Alterations at these two positions were found to dramatically affect polymerase processivity, template primer affinity, and frameshift fidelity (21Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, several mutations shown to affect HIV-1 RT polymerase fidelity presumably do so by “repositioning” the template primer, ultimately leading to a more or less stringent dNTP-binding site and/or polymerase active site. In either case, repositioning of the template primer affects the ability of HIV-1 RT to discriminate between correctversus incorrect dNTP substrates.Most of the template- or primer-contacting residues that influence fidelity (Glu89, Met184, Gly262, and Trp266) contact the nucleic acid within the template primer duplex with the exception of residues such as Asp76and Arg78, which contact the sugar-phosphate backbone of the templating nucleotide. Thus, mutations that affect misincorporation fidelity or the overall mutation rates of HIV-1 RT appear to contact the incoming dNTP (K65R and M184V), the primer terminus (M184V), the templating base (L74V), or the template strand within the duplex region (E89G, G262A, and W266A). None of the residues that contact the template overhang beyond the templating base have been reported to affect fidelity. The recent crystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with a DNA-DNA template primer and dNTP shows that two highly conserved amino acid residues in the finger subdomain, Phe61 and Trp24, interact with the extended single-stranded template (17Huang H. Chopra R. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Earlier crystallographic data suggested that the extended template would continue in a helical path, entering the polymerase active site through the cleft formed by the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains of HIV-1 RT (24Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 25Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D.J., Lu, X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). However, as shown in the crystal structure of the ternary complex, the template does not continue in a helical path but instead bends away from the duplex, making contact along the face of the finger subdomain. Trp24 is proposed to interact with the phosphate group between the second and third nucleotide, whereas Phe61 contacts both the first and second nucleotides of the extended template. As mentioned above, several mutations within the finger subdomain of HIV-1 RT affect the fidelity of the enzyme and its sensitivity to NRTIs. Therefore, it is possible that these two conserved contacts with the extended template may contribute to the observed poor fidelity of HIV-1 RT during DNA synthesis.In this report, we have evaluated the influence of the Phe61 residue on polymerase fidelity. Substitutions created at Phe61 were found to increase the fidelity of DNA synthesis by RT. Interestingly, the changes in fidelity of Phe61 mutant RTs correlated with their sensitivity to NRTIs. We conclude that contacts between the finger subdomain of HIV-1 RT and the extended single-stranded template are functionally important in determining the overall polymerase fidelity and dNTP analog sensitivity of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we carried out a structure-based mutagenesis of Phe61 in HIV-1 RT to determine whether proposed contacts between this residue and the extended single-stranded template play a functional role in polymerase fidelity and sensitivity to nucleoside analog drugs. A limited vertical scanning mutagenesis (Phe → Ala, Leu, Trp, or Tyr) at position 61 of HIV-1 RT was used to evaluate any influence on enzyme function. First, most substitutions at Phe61 had a minimal effect on the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities of HIV-1 RT, although the F61A variant was considerably less efficient when using a heteropolymeric RNA template (Fig. 1 and Table I). Second, measurements of misincorporation and mispair extension fidelity of wild type and mutant RTs indicated that all substitutions at Phe61 led to a higher fidelity, with less conserved substitutions, e.g. F61A and F61L, displaying the greatest increase (Figs. 2 and 3). The increase in fidelity of F61A was further corroborated by a nearly 12-fold higher fidelity observed in the forward mutation assay (Table II). Third, along with an increase in fidelity, Phe61 variants were significantly less sensitive to inhibition by NRTIs tested (Table III). Therefore, we conclude that Phe61, located within the β3 strand of the finger subdomain of HIV-1 RT, plays an important role in determining the fidelity of DNA synthesis and sensitivity to NRTIs.The effect of substitutions at Phe61 on polymerase fidelity was determined using two gel-based assays measuring misincorporation and mispair extension efficiencies in addition to an M13-based forward mutation assay used for F61A mutant. Does the dNTP exclusion assay reflect the true fidelity of RT? Two issues need to be addressed. First, it may be argued that the lowered synthesis in the absence of a single dNTP is due to a reduced enzymatic activity. However, as seen in Fig. 1, the relative activities of F61L, F61W, and F61Y in DNA-dependent DNA polymerase assays are similar despite wide variations in their relative fidelities in assays lacking dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Even though F61A is the only mutation that led to reduced DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1), all substitutions at Phe61appear to reduce the ability of HIV-1 RT for misincorporation and mispair extension (Figs. 2 and 3). Therefore, the lack of extension products past the barrier site was likely not due to a decrease in catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, the control reactions in the dNTP exclusion (Fig. 2 A, panel labeled All dNTPs) and mispair extension (Fig. 3; properly base-paired G-C template primer) assays each demonstrate that all enzymes were used at input levels capable of extending similar amounts of primer under the reaction conditions used. Thus, variations in the specific activities of the mutant RTs did not contribute to differences in misincorporation. Second, it is possible that the products resulting from synthesis beyond the barrier site represent those that are extended by the missing dNTP, which is often present at contaminating levels in the remaining three dNTP preparations used in the reaction. It is known that the addition of different dNTPs to a 5′-end labeled primer will result in different degrees of electrophoretic mobility shifts and thus can be easily verified by denaturing PAGE (10Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M., Gu, Z. Song Q. Manne J. Islam S. Castriota G. Prasad V.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As shown in those earlier studies by our laboratory, the purity of the dNTPs used in our reactions is high enough that contaminating dNTPs are not detected in primer extension assays.The first nucleoside analog resistance mutations shown to increase dNTP misinsertion fidelity, E89G and M184V, both displayed no significant difference from wild type in their overall mutation frequency (10Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M., Gu, Z. Song Q. Manne J. Islam S. Castriota G.

However, variants of HIV-1 RT containing several other RT mutations, M184I, K65R, L74V, D76V, and R78A, displayed a positive correlation between changes in fidelity based on the dNTP misincorporation assays (14Hsu M.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2658-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is important to point out that four of the five mutations for which such positive correlation was previously demonstrated map to the finger domain, as does the F61A mutation, which also shows increased fidelity both in misincorporation assays and in forward mutation assays.The crystal structure of HIV-1 RT in a covalently trapped RT double-stranded DNA template primer-dNTP ternary complex shows a movement of the finger subdomain toward the polymerase active site (17Huang H. Chopra R. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). As a result, a “closed” complex is formed, with several residues previously implicated in NRTI resistance brought into direct contact with the incoming dNTP. Similar to other polymerase structures solved (32Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 33Doublie S.

Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the single-stranded template 5′-overhang is bent away from the helical path of the duplex, making contact with several amino acid residues on the outer surface of the finger subdomain of HIV-1 RT. Two such residues that make contact with the first nucleotide of the extended template (the templating nucleotide), Asp76 and Arg78, were previously shown to be involved in polymerase fidelity and processivity (19Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Kim B. Ayran J.C. Sagar S.G. Adman E.T. Fuller S.M. Tran N.H. Horrigan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27666-27673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to crystallographic and mutagenesis data, biochemical evidence has indicated that the finger subdomain makes contacts with the extended template ahead of the polymerase active site. For example, footprinting studies of HIV-1 RT-template primer complexes using DNase I and hydroxyl radicals have shown areas of protection on the template strand from +7 to −23 and +3 to −15, respectively (35Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O., Le Grice S.F.J. Neumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The affinity of HIV-1 RT for the template-primer was greatly increased with templates extended at least four nucleotides 5′ to the site of dNTP incorporation (37Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J.

Cross-linking experiments have also demonstrated that several residues within the finger subdomain contact the extended template (39Peletskaya E.N. Boyer P.L. Kogon A.A. Clark P. Kroth H. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9435-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Earlier work has documented the influence of residues contacting the template primer duplex upstream of the primer 3′-hydroxyl terminus on the geometry of the dNTP-binding pocket (10Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Klarmann G.J. Smith R.A. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. Preston B.D. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 11363-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The results reported here show for the first time that mutations at residues that may be contacting the template overhang also influence the geometry of the dNTP-binding pocket. In fact, the level of resistance observed here (60–72-fold) is one of the highest reported for substitutions at template-contacting residues.Based on both previous work and our current results, we propose that upon closing the finger subdomain with bound dNTP into a closed complex, contacts are formed between Phe61 and both the first and second nucleotide of the extended template. Presumably, these contacts between the wild type Phe61 residue and the extended template contribute to an error-prone polymerase active site capable of accepting incorrect dNTPs and NRTIs. If Phe61plays a role in the observed bending of the template out of its helical path, this may provide a more flexible dNTP-binding pocket. In the case of the F61A mutant, contacts with the +1 and +2 template position may be lost; bending of the template may be reduced, resulting in an altered template path and ultimately a more stringent dNTP-binding pocket. Recent work suggests that the size and shape complementarity, rather than the ability of dNTPs to hydrogen bond to the template nucleotide, are responsible for the high fidelity of DNA replication (41Matray T.J. Kool E.T. Nature. 1999; 399: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 42Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on our results, we propose that Phe61-template contacts contribute significantly to a “loose” dNTP-binding pocket that enables HIV-1 RT to both misinsert incorrect dNTPs and extend mispaired primer termini, leading to an overall low polymerase fidelity and sensitivity to NRTIs. Previously solved structures of HIV-1 RT in complex with a template-primer contained a template with only a single nucleotide overhang, and therefore it was not possible to determine whether Phe61interacts with the extended template in this conformation. However, contacts between HIV-1 RT and the template primer would likely affect the ability of RT to discriminate between correct and incorrect dNTPs upon dNTP binding or after misinsertion takes place. Therefore, contacts between Phe61 of HIV-1 RT and the extended template in the closed RT-template primer-dNTP ternary complex are likely to be functionally important in determining polymerase fidelity. Whether the F61A mutation results in a complete loss of this contact with the template, a change in the geometry of the dNTP-binding pocket, or an altered trajectory of the extended template requires further crystallographic analysis of this mutant RT-template primer-dNTP complex.The Phe61 residue of HIV-1 RT is highly conserved among several groups of retroviral RTs (43Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Phe61 is likely to have been retained because it supports both catalytic activity and error-prone DNA synthesis. The error-prone nature of HIV-1 RT, in combination with a robust rate of virus replication enables the virus to evade both drug and immune selection in vivo. The F61A and F61L mutations, both of which confer significant resistance to NRTIs, have not been found in drug-resistant clinical isolates of HIV-1. As described in this report, both of these mutants displayed a significant decrease in the catalytic efficiency on a heteropolymeric RNA template (Table I) and may contribute to a reduction in the rate of replication and/or viral fitness.Furthermore, both F61A and F61L mutant RTs also displayed significantly lower polymerase processivity compared with the wild type enzyme (data not shown). It must be cautioned that a decreased sensitivity of these mutants to NRTIs may also be due to increased dissociation of RT from chain terminated primer termini. Measure"

Therefore, further studies on the transcriptional regulation of rod-specificβ-PDE gene will identify additional genes important for retinal function and structural integrity and will ultimately help to establish the molecular mechanisms crucial for retina-specific expression of this and perhaps some other genes. We recently reported our initial results on the transcriptional control mechanisms that take place in the human β-PDE5′-flanking region (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the β-PDEpromoter tested both in vitro and ex vivo, and confirmed by the generation of transgenic Xenopus expressing mutant β-PDE promoter/green fluorescent protein fusion constructs in vivo, revealed a minimal promoter region, from −93 to +53, that supports high levels of rod-specific transcription (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two enhancer elements were localized within this minimal promoter, βAp1/NRE and β/GC, that interact with nuclear factors and activate transcription from the β-PDE promoter. To continue the systematic analysis of the β-PDE promoter structure, we have now carried out extensive mutagenesis of the proximal promoter and the 5′-untranslated region. The presence of a consensus CRE sequence in the minimal rod-specific β-PDEpromoter prompted us to test whether Crx (cone, rod homeobox), a member of the Otx family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors, is involved in transcriptional regulation of the β-PDE gene. Previously, Crx had been shown to be important for the transcriptional control of several retina-specific genes, including rhodopsin (15Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 16Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We report here that although Crx is capable of modest transactivation of the β-PDE promoter when overexpressed in 293 embryonic kidney cells, transfections in Y79 retinoblastoma cells andXenopus embryonic heads showed that it is unlikely to be a major player in transcriptional regulation of the β-PDEgene. We also show that both purified TBP and TFIIB were able to bind to the β-PDE proximal promoter (−45/−16) with cooperative enhancement of binding. The interactions between theβ-PDE promoter and the basal transcription factors were not completely disrupted by limited nucleotide substitutions in this region, which may be related to the complex, low affinity, basal transcription factor-promoter interactions over extended core promoter sequences described on other promoters (17Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The functionally important β/GC element is homologous to the consensus GC box that binds members of the Sp family of transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. These nuclear factors share similar structural features and have highly conserved DNA binding domains that allow them to bind with identical affinity to the consensus GC box (19Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Sp1 and Sp4 can interact with the β-PDE promoter (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our intriguing finding that the predominantly central nervous system-expressed Sp4 is also abundantly present in the adult retina prompted us to further test its activation properties on the rod-specific β-PDEpromoter under defined conditions in direct comparison to Sp1 and Sp3. We report here that only Sp4, but not Sp1 or Sp3, is a strong activator of transcription from the β-PDE promoter. Thus, the rod-specific β-PDE gene is the first specific gene target for the Sp4 transcription factor described to date. Y79 human retinoblastoma cells and 293 human embryonic kidney cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Y79 retinoblastoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) as described previously (20Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293 kidney cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cells have been used previously for testing multiple retina-specific promoters and transcription factors including Crx (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol.

Calcium phosphate-mediated transient transfections as well as luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (20Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for the addition of a glycerol shock that improved the transfection efficiency of 293 kidney cells. For normalization of transfection efficiency, all transfection reactions included 5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid as an internal control. In cotransfection experiments, the ratios of the reporter vector to expression plasmid were determined empirically. For each experiment, the total amount of transfected DNA per plate was kept constant (15 μg per 60-mm plate) by addition of carrier plasmid DNA. Triplicate plates were used for all transfections, and experiments were repeated several times. 5′-End deletions in human β-PDEpromoter were generated by PCR using sequence-specific primers as described previously (20Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion constructs were designated based on the inserted β-PDE sequences relative to the major transcription start site of the gene (e.g. −93 to +53). A luciferase reporter construct containing the −132 to +138 sequence of the human α′-PDE was also engineered in the pGL2-Basic vector. Substitution mutations by nucleotide transversions were generated in the context of the −72 to +53 β-PDE sequence in the pGL2-Basic vector as described previously (20Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 617-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct designation refers to the positions of the mutated nucleotides in theβ-PDE promoter relative to the transcription start site. For example, the −51/−49m construct contains mutations in nucleotides −51 through −49. All inserted sequences were fully sequenced in both directions to confirm identity and desired alterations. The pcDNA-Crx expression plasmid containing a full-length bovine Crx cDNA and the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) was obtained from Dr. Donald Zack (15Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G.

The pMT-Nrl expression plasmid encoding the full-length human Nrl, pMT-DD10 encoding the truncated Nrl mutant that has its N-terminal acidic domain deleted, and the empty pMT3 vector were kindly supplied by Dr. Anand Swaroop (21Rehemtulla A. Warwar R. Kumar R., Ji, X. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Dr. Guntram Suske kindly provided us with pRC/CMV-Sp1, pRC/CMV-Sp3, and pRC/CMV-Sp4 encoding the full-length Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, respectively (22Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In cotransfection experiments, empty expression vectors were used to keep the amount of DNA constant for each transfected plate. Gel mobility shift assays (GMSA) were performed essentially as described elsewhere (18Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5% polyacrylamide gel (1.7% cross-linking) contained 0.5× TBE, 5% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. 10-μl binding reactions included 50 ng of poly(dG-dC), 0.1 ng of the probe (0.5–1 × 105 cpm), 20–25 nm TBP, and/or 20–25 nm TFIIB. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and promptly loaded onto the gel. Electrophoresis was carried out for 20–30 min at 400 V due to the rapid dissociation rate of TBP-DNA complexes. The temperature of the electrophoresis running buffer (0.5× TBE, 2 mm MgCl2, prechilled and submerged in ice) in both compartments of the gel apparatus (Mini-Protein II tank, Bio-Rad) and the temperature of the gel plates were measured at the beginning and the end of each experiment and was maintained at less than 21 °C with continuous cooling. Gel images were captured and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Purified TBP and TFIIB were a kind gift of Dr. Branden S. Wolner. Theβ-PDE oligonucleotide probe was prepared by annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides radiolabeled at the 5′-end. The labeled probe was purified with MicroSpin™ G-25 columns (AmershamBiosciences). The adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter probe has been described previously (18Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Preparation of Xenopus embryo heads and the transient transfection procedure using DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were described previously (23Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos at stages 24–28 were selected and prepared by severing embryos at the ear placode. Transfection of each of the tested DNA constructs was carried out in groups of 10–12 dissected embryo heads. Three to six independent groups of dissected embryo heads were used for testing each construct. After 20 h of ex vivo organ culturing, the DNA-containing medium was replaced by a fresh culture medium. Incubation was continued until 78 h post-fertilization when the embryo heads were harvested and homogenized. Protein extracts from the embryonic heads were prepared, and duplicate aliquots were used to measure luciferase activity. Comparison of sample means was performed in a large number of experimental trials as described previously (23Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A construct containing the −508 to +41 region of the Xenopus opsin promoter was used as positive control (24Mani S.S. Batni S. Whitaker L. Chen S. Engbretson G. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36557-36565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the empty pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) as negative control. In addition, to control for specificity of retinal cell type expression, allβ-PDE promoter constructs were transfected in dissectedXenopus embryo trunks that contain many cell types (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and showed no activity (data not shown). Significant reduction of transcriptional activity occurs with the 5′-end deletion of β-PDE promoter sequences from −72 to −45 (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the −45 to +53 construct showed residual promoter activity about 8–10-fold that of the promoter-less control (Fig.1 A), which suggests the presence of additional regulatory sequences. Thus, as an initial step toward identifying the potential control elements located in this region, further deletions of the proximal promoter were performed. The −45 to +53, −23 to +53, and +4 to +53 β-PDEpromoter/luciferase fusion constructs were transiently transfected first in cultured Y79 human retinoblastoma cells and then ex vivo in dissected Xenopus embryo heads. These human retina-derived cell culture and amphibian in situtransfection systems have been employed previously for studying the regulation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression, including that ofβ-PDE (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase activities obtained with a control plasmid in Y79 cells or expressed per embryo and averaged statistically as described previously for Xenopus transfections (23Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further reduction in promoter activity was observed in both transfection systems when the −45 to −23 region was deleted (Fig. 1). The activity level of the −23 to +53 promoter was not significantly different from that observed with the promoter-less vector when tested in Y79 cells or Xenopus embryos. The +4 to +53 promoter construct carrying further 5′-end deletion past the major transcription start site (25Di Polo A. Rickman C.B. Farber D.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar) showed that luciferase activity remained low. High evolutionary conservation of the −45 to −23 region (25Di Polo A. Rickman C.B. Farber D.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar) that composes the consensus CRE motif (−41/−36) and the T/A-rich β/TA sequence located at a consensus position for the TATA box is evident between mouse and human also suggesting its functional importance. The CRE motif ((C/T)TAATC) interacts with Crx and plays an important regulatory role in the transcription of rhodopsin and several other retina-specific genes (15Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H.

Recently, mutations in Crx have been linked to various forms of human retinal degeneration (10Swain P.K. Chen S. Wang Q.L. Affatigato L.M. Coats C.L. Brady K.D. Fishman G.A. Jacobson S.G. Swaroop A.

To investigate whether Crx is able to directly transactivate the β-PDE promoter, we transiently overexpressed Crx in 293 human embryonic kidney cells in cotransfections with different deletion mutants of theβ-PDE promoter. These cells do not endogenously produce rod-specific phosphodiesterases including β-PDE and have been used previously for transient transfections to study transcriptional regulation of the β-PDE gene (14Lerner L.E.

Fig.1 B shows that although the uninduced activity of the −45 to +53 promoter was significantly lower than that of the −72 to +53 construct, overexpressed Crx caused similar (∼4-fold) transactivation of both promoters. In contrast, the −23 to +53 construct produced luciferase activity comparable with that of the promoter-less control and failed to show any transactivation potential when coexpressed with Crx. For comparison, we also tested the promoter region of the cone photoreceptor-specific α′-PDE gene that contains two sequences homologous to consensus CRE, one at position −95/−89 (TTAATCC) and the other at −118/−112 (GATTTAG). Cotransfections of the −132 to +138 α′-PDE/luciferase reporter construct with the Crx expression plasmid resulted in ∼8-fold increase in promoter activity compared with the uninduced promoter (Fig.1 B). Since the −45/−23 region was found to be important for theβ-PDE promoter transactivation by overexpressed Crx, we tested whether the consensus CRE located within this region (−41/−36) was responsible for this transactivation. We also tested whether Crx-mediated transactivation of the β-PDE promoter had functional synergy with Nrl that had been previously shown to bind and transactivate this promoter (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The activity of the wild-type −72 to +53 β-PDE promoter was compared with the CRE-mutant construct −41/−38m. Approximately 9–10-fold increase in luciferase activity by coexpressed Crx and Nrl was observed compared with the ∼4-fold increase caused by Crx alone and a 3-fold increase produced by Nrl alone (Fig. 1 C). These results are consistent with an additive or a modest synergistic effect, which differs from the rhodopsin promoter that shows significant synergistic transactivation by the combination of Crx and Nrl (15Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The −41/−38 mutation disrupting the consensus CRE caused substantial reduction in overexpressed Crx- or Crx/Nrl-mediated transactivation of theβ-PDE promoter (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the Nrl-mediated transactivation of CRE-mutant promoter remained unaffected by this mutation providing a positive control for sequence specificity of the Crx-CRE-mediated transactivation. To determine whether the transactivation of the β-PDEpromoter/luciferase constructs by Crx and Nrl was specific for theβ-PDE promoter, an SV40promoter/luciferase construct (pGL2-Promoter™, Promega) was tested as control and showed no significant induction of luciferase activity (1.3-fold increase) by the mixture of Nrl and Crx (data not shown). This is consistent with the previous report of the inability of Crx to transactivate a non-retinal collagenase promoter/luciferase construct (15Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and suggests that there is promoter selectivity in the Nrl/Crx transactivation mechanism. Based on the results described above, we further investigated whether CRE and its flanking sequences were functionally relevant to the transcriptional regulation of the β-PDEpromoter in vivo in the context of a retina-relevant environment. A series of β-PDE promoter mutants carrying substitutions in the −45 to −23 region was transfected in Y79 retinoblastoma cells and then in Xenopus embryos maintainedex vivo (summarized in Fig. 2,top). Contrary to our initial expectations, the −41/−38m mutation that completely disrupted the consensus CRE had little effect on the β-PDE promoter activity in both transfection systems (Fig. 2 A). In addition, no significant changes were seen with mutations in −37/−36, −35/−34, and −33/32. The −30/−27m mutant containing nucleotide substitutions in positions 2–5 (−31TAAGAAA−25 to TCCTCAA) of the T/A-rich sequence also showed no significant effect on transcription. Although neither the mutations in consensus CRE or β/TA affected promoter activity, a cooperative interaction of transcription factors at both sites located in close proximity of each other could not be ruled out. Therefore, a double mutant was constructed that contained both −30/−27m and −41/−38m. Transient transfections of Y79 cells using the double mutant showed no significant alterations in promoter activity compared with the wild-type β-PDE promoter (Fig.2 B). To search for other regulatory sequences in this TATA- and Inr-less gene, additional β-PDE promoter mutants (n = 14) containing nucleotide substitutions spanning the proximal 5′-flanking and the 5′-untranslated regions (−23 to +53; Fig. 2, top) were tested in transient transfections of Y79 retinoblastoma cells. Promoter activity determined in these mutants ranged between ∼0.5- and 1.5-fold that of the wild-type control (Fig.2 B). A 3′-end deletion mutant (−72 to +4) lacking most of the 5′-UTR showed ∼3-fold reduction of promoter activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the β-PDEpromoter does not have well defined core elements responsible for basal transcription in Y-79 cells or Xenopus embryo heads. Rather, it appears that the transcription factors responsible for maintaining low level expression from this promoter do not require a rigid sequence for interactions, but can accommodate a range of nucleotides. Although the β/TA sequence located at −31/−25 of the β-PDE promoter is significantly different from the consensus TATA box, it has a high T/A content and is located in the proximity of the transcription start site with no other consensus core promoter elements present in this gene. Thus, we tested whether the β/TA sequence was able to bind purified TBP separately or in complex with TFIIB in GMSAs. As a control, we compared the binding of TBP, TFIIB, and the TFIIB-TBP combination to the AdML promoter. Shifted bands were observed with the addition of either TBP alone or TFIIB alone to the β/TA probe (Fig.3 A). Addition of the combination of TBP and TFIIB resulted in a slower migrating complex with about 3-fold increase in band intensity compared with TBP alone, producing a characteristic supershifted pattern described previously for the AdML promoter (18Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results suggest an enhanced cooperative binding by the TFIIB-TBP complex to the β-PDEpromoter compared with TBP alone. In contrast, when comparable protein concentrations were used, the AdML promoter interacted with TBP and TFIIB-TBP, but did not form a stable TFIIB-DNA complex in GMSA as demonstrated previously (Ref. 18Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and data not shown). Although the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of the wild-type −45/−16 competitor to the binding reaction prevented the shifted complex formation, the mutant −30/−27m and −35/−27m competitors also showed some competition with the wild-type sequence for TFIIB-TBP binding. These results further corroborate our functional transfection data that a well defined core promoter sequence could not be found in theβ-PDE 5′-flanking region. Mutational analyses and in vitro protein-DNA binding studies have defined the β/GC element (−55/−46) as an important enhancer of the β-PDE promoter that binds transcription factors of the Sp family (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We compared different members of the Sp protein family (Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4) that share similar DNA-binding characteristics (19Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) for their effects on transcription from the β-PDE promoter. Increasing amounts of expression plasmids (0.08, 0.4, and 2 μg) each carrying a full-length cDNA for either Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 were transiently coexpressed with the wild-type minimal rod-specific β-PDE promoter (−93 to +53, 2 μg). Compared with other members of the Sp family, Sp4 was the only transcription factor that showed significant dose-dependent effect on the β-PDE promoter (Fig. 4 A). Promoter specificity of the Sp4-mediated transactivation was confirmed by comparing its effect on transcription from the β-PDEpromoter (∼21-fold enhancement) to that on the SV40promoter (no significant change) relative to the uninduced transcription, respectively, when tested in the 293 cell transfection system (Fig. 4 B). The maximum activation was observed using 2 μg of pRC/CMV-Sp4 and was comparable with that seen using 5 μg of pRC/CMV-Sp4 indicating a saturation effect. In contrast, neither Sp1 nor Sp3 showed any significant effect on transcription from eitherβ-PDE or SV40 promoter compared with the dramatic difference between Sp4-mediated transactivation of the two promoters. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of theβ-PDE gene showed that it has several sites homologous to known response elements (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These include an E box, an AP1/NRE–like sequence (βAp1/NRE), a GC box-like site (β/GC), and a sequence identical to the consensus CRE. We recently demonstrated that βAp1/NRE and β/GC were cis-acting elements functionally important for β-PDE transcriptional regulation and that the E box seemed to have no significant role in β-PDEtranscription (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Di Polo A. Lerner L.E. Farber D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into transcriptional regulation of this rod photoreceptor-specific gene, we performed a detailed mutagenic screen of the β-PDE promoter and the 5′-UTR. The functional relevance of the consensus CRE motif (−41/−36) was also investigated. In addition, we tested the effects of different members of the Sp family of transcription factors on activity of theβ-PDE promoter that contains the functionally important β/GC element. Because the β-PDE gene does not have a TATA box, Inr sequence, or other known core promoter elements, we extended our studies to include the basal promoter region. Crx has been shown to interact with the upstream region of theβ-PDE gene in DNase I footprinting assays (15Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We observed a modest increase in β-PDE promoter activity by cotransfected Crx that was significantly reduced after substituting CRE nucleotides −41/−38 and virtually eliminated with the −23 to +53 construct that completely lacks CRE and the surrounding sequences. Although the luciferase gene has been reported to show promoter-independent enhancement of its expression under certain conditions, e.g. induced by IFN-γ (29Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), this was not the case for Crx- and Crx/Nrl-activated β-PDEpromoter/luciferase transcription in 293 kidney cells. TheSV40 promoter/luciferase control was not affected by overexpressed Crx either alone or with cotransfected Nrl excluding the possibility of promoter-independent activation of luciferase or a general, nonspecific effect on transcription in 293 cells. Thus, our data show that Crx can interact and moderately transactivate theβ-PDE promoter when overexpressed at high concentrations in 293 kidney cells and that the −41/−36 sequence functions as CRE. However, in transfections of both Y79 retinoblastoma cells andXenopus embryos, β-PDE mutants with disrupted CRE (−41/−38m and −37/−36m) showed promoter activity comparable with that of the wild-type promoter. The lack of effect of an in vivo concentration of Crx on the β-PDE transcription in a retinal system differs from the transcriptional activation of theβ-PDE promoter by cotransfected Crx in 293 kidney cells. The latter could be caused by Crx overexpression and, possibly, by the context of a non-retinal cell line that may contain additional cofactors interacting with Crx. Therefore, although Crx is involved in the regulation of several other photoreceptor-specific genes, our results suggest that the CRE-like sequence located in theβ-PDE proximal promoter is unlikely to be a functional element important for the transcriptional activation of this gene in retinal cells. Nevertheless, under certain conditions, Crx may be able to modulate the effect of other transcription factors. The possibility of an additional regulatory sequence(s) in theβ-PDE basal promoter region or the 5′-UTR is suggested by the tight regulation of the transcriptional initiation site selection in this gene. There are only one major and one minor transcription start sites in both human and murine β-PDE genes (25Di Polo A. Rickman C.B. Farber D.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates the assembly of the basal transcription machinery at a specific core promoter element rather than random binding to a variety of sequences. However, there are no consensus core promoter elements in the β-PDE gene. The T/A-rich β/TA sequence located 25 bp upstream from the major transcription start site of theβ-PDE gene (−31/−25) seemed to be a likely site for interactions with basal transcription factors, although this sequence (TAAGAAA) is not predicted from crystallographic studies to form a stable TBP-DNA complex (30Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, our protein binding studies suggest that the β-PDE promoter forms stable interactionsin vitro in GMSA with purified TBP as well as with the TFIIB-TBP complex, with a cooperative enhancement of binding. Interestingly, a stable β-PDE promoter-TFIIB complex was also observed in the absence of TBP with a relatively modest concentration of TFIIB. Because the β-PDE promoter lacks the consensus BRE, (G/C)(G/C)(G/A)CGCC (30Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), proposed to be a binding site for TFIIB, it is likely that TFIIB interacts with an alternative DNA sequence in the β-PDE promoter. In addition, deletion of the −45/−23 region reduced the promoter activity virtually to the level of the promoter-less vector suggesting the presence of nucleotides critical for the β-PDE transcription. However, we observed no effect of a 4-nucleotide substitution in β/TA (−30/−27m) on promoter activity in either Y79 retinoblastoma cells orXenopus embryos. Both −30/−27m and −35/−26m showed significant competition with the wild-type sequence for TFIIB-TBP binding in GMSA. These results suggest the lack of a well defined core element in this promoter necessary for basal transcription machinery binding and low level basal transcription. The most significant finding of the present investigation was the demonstration of the functional involvement of members of the Sp family in transcriptional regulation of the β-PDE promoter. Interestingly, Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 transcription factors showed differential effects on the β-PDE promoter activity. Sp4-mediated transactivation was significantly higher than that produced by Sp1 or Sp3, which suggests the importance of this transcription factor for the β-PDE gene transcription. Whereas Sp4 is predominantly restricted to the central nervous system and retina in vivo, it is expressed in many cell lines (19Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) including the 293 kidney cells. 2L. E. Lerner, Y. E. Gribanova, and D. B. Farber, unpublished observations. Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitous in mammalian cells. Therefore, all three proteins are expressed in 293 cells. Nevertheless, the difference between Sp4-mediated transactivation of the β-PDE andSV40 promoters was dramatic compared with Sp1 and Sp3. Members of the Sp family bind GC-rich DNA sequences through three zinc finger motifs. The residues involved in the determination of the target site specificity and binding affinity are highly conserved between Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. In fact, all of these transcription factors bind GC and GT boxes with equal affinity in vitro (19Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Thus, a relative abundance of any one of the Sp proteins would lead to its increased competition with the others for the β-PDE promoter binding. However, DNA binding by single proteins may not be the key molecular basis to explain the Sp4, Sp1, and Sp3 functional differencesin vivo. The β-PDE promoter contains other regulatory sequences. Thus, the differential Sp4-mediated stimulation of this gene transcription is likely to be dependent on its promoter context. Sp4 has been the least characterized member of the Sp family partly because of its restricted pattern of expression in vivo. Here we demonstrate the first natural target gene for Sp4 that also seems to lack transcriptional regulation by Sp1 and Sp3. The fact that Sp4 was the only transcription factor to transactivate significantly the rod-specific β-PDE promoter supports our previous finding of this highly restricted protein, compared with Sp1 or Sp3, being abundantly expressed in retina (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The lack of other known Sp4 targets combined with our finding of its regulation of a very specific rod-restricted β-PDE gene implies that this transcription factor functions in a relatively narrow promoter-specific manner. In addition, Sp4 could have a more universal role in cell type-specific expression of certain genes in rods and possibly other retinal cell populations by interacting with different arrays of transcription factors. We have shown previously that another nuclear factor, Nrl, regulates transcription from the β-PDE promoter (14Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E., Ji, M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Considering the additional β-PDE transcriptional mechanism described in this study, we can suggest that a unique combination of molecular interactions may be required for rod-specific transcription from this TATA- and Inr-less promoter (Fig.5). This is consistent with the combinatorial model of transcriptional regulation of cell-specific gene expression. We thank Branden S. Wolner for help with GMSAs using purified basal transcription factors TBP and TFIIB."

IMP cyclohydrolase (IMPCH) catalyzes the subsequent ring closure reaction to form IMP and a molecule of water (Fig. 1). These activities are located in separate domains of the ATIC protein. The AICARFT activity is located in a larger C-terminal region, and the IMPCH activity resides in a smaller N-terminal region (1Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol.

Because of the likelihood that hATIC-b is the predominant form expressed in human tissues (2Sugita T. Aya H. Ueno M. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. J. Biochem.

Interest in ATIC stems in part from its potential as a chemotherapeutic target. Glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, the third enzyme activity in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, and the AICARFT activity of ATIC each require the same reduced folate cofactor, which makes them potential targets for the antifolate class of chemotherapeutic agents. (6R)-5,10-Dideazatetrahydrofolate (DDATHF, Lometrexol) is a potent antiproliferative agent that functions through the inhibition of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase.

The actions of certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of the antifolate methotrexate, have been attributed in part to the inhibition of AICARFT (8Cronstein B.N.

ATIC is the only enzyme involved in the de novosynthesis of purine nucleotides that is bifunctional in every organism studied. This apparent evolutionary conservation raises the question of whether there may be a functional advantage to this structural arrangement. Perhaps the intermediate, FAICAR, is transferred directly from the AICARFT site to the IMPCH site without diffusing through bulk solution. The process of the direct transfer of an intermediate has been termed substrate channeling. This phenomenon has been demonstrated to occur with several multifunctional enzymes (11Anderson K.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The advantages conferred by substrate channeling may include the maximization of efficiency in the use of metabolites in a pathway and the transfer of very unstable or volatile products that would have a very short half-life in bulk solution. Among the best characterized examples of substrate channeling are those for which there is both kinetic evidence of channeling and a clear structural basis for the process (16Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such examples include tryptophan synthase (11Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the bifunctional thymidylate synthase/dihydrofolate reductase from Leishmania major (12Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (17Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There are at least two cases of apparent substrate channeling in thede novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. The first enzyme in the pathway, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate plus NH3 and the transfer of the NH3 to phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, forming phosphoribosylamine. Structural and kinetic studies of the enzyme from Escherichia coli have shown that the two steps are carried out at separate sites and that the NH3 is transferred through a transient 20 Å hydrophobic channel (13Muchmore C.R. Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Burns M.R. Parry R.J. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11061-11068Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The second case for which there is evidence of substrate channeling in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway occurs between the first and second enzymes in the pathway, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase, respectively. Kinetic evidence suggests that the unstable intermediate, phosphoribosylamine, must be channeled directly from the first enzyme to the second, although attempts to isolate a complex between the two enzymes have thus far been unsuccessful (15Rudolph J. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Bifunctional ATIC seemed to be a strong candidate for substrate channeling based on its conservation of bifunctionality throughout nature as well as its role in a metabolic pathway. The use of steady-state isotope dilution experiments and substrate analogs of AICAR have provided indirect evidence suggesting that channeling of FAICAR does not occur with ATIC (18Szabados E. Christopherson R.I. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 401-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Szabados E. Christopherson R.I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Wall M. Shim J.H. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11303-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this report, we have addressed the question of substrate channeling directly using a transient kinetic approach that includes rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow methodologies. This strategy has several advantages in examining substrate channeling because it allows one to directly monitor chemical catalysis at each active site as well as the transit of the putative intermediate or metabolite from one active site to another through the use of single turnover kinetic analysis. Using this approach, we provide a complete kinetic description of the reaction pathway for the ATIC enzyme as well as definitive evidence for the lack of substrate channeling. The previously described plasmid, pETATIC-b (21Vergis J.M. Bulock K.G. Fleming K.G. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7727-7733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was transformed into E. coli TunerTM (DE3)(Novagen) by heat shock. E. coli transformants were grown in 2YT bacterial media with 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A 600 value of 0.6–0.8. The cultures were then induced with 400 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.85% NaCl, and either stored at −80 °C or used immediately. The purification of human ATIC was carried out as described previously (21Vergis J.M. Bulock K.G. Fleming K.G. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7727-7733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). [3H]AICAR was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals and converted enzymatically to [3H]FAICAR. hATIC (100 μm) was incubated under single turnover conditions (50 μm[3H]AICAR and 300 μm 10-fFH4). Samples of the reaction mixture were collected at time points early in the course of the reaction (100 ms). These samples were pooled and lyophilized to dryness. The reaction products were separated by HPLC using a Whatman 10-μm SAX anion exchange column eluted isocratically with 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 2.5, at 1 ml/min. The retention times for standards were as follows: AICAR, 8.1 min; FAICAR, 12.9 min; and IMP, 15.9 min. The [3H]FAICAR peak was collected, lyophilized, and redissolved in a suitable amount of 50 mm ammonium acetate to be further purified by reverse phase HPLC. The reverse phase HPLC was performed using a 7-μm Adsorbosphere nucleotide-nucleoside reverse phase column (Alltech Associates) eluted isocratically with a mobile phase consisting of 50 mmammonium acetate, pH 7.0, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and 10% methanol at 1 ml/min. The retention time for the FAICAR standard was 6.9 min, whereas AICAR and IMP standards co-eluted at 10 min. The [3H]FAICAR peak was collected and lyophilized to remove ammonium acetate. The pure [3H]FAICAR was dissolved in water and stored as aliquots at −20 °C until needed. All steady-state spectrophotometric assays were performed using a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer and PerkinElmer PECSS computerized spectroscopy data acquisition software. All reaction mixtures were 500 μl in volume and were carried out in 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvettes at room temperature unless otherwise noted. For the standard AICARFT assay, reaction mixtures contained final concentrations of 66 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmKCl, 100 μm AICAR (Sigma), and 300 μm10-fFH4. The reaction was initiated by the addition of hATIC (typically 10–500 nm final concentration). The reactions were monitored by observing the formation of THF at 298 nm by a method described previously (22Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Black S.L. Black M.J. Mangum J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 10-fFH4 was synthesized from (6S)-5-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid (Schircks Laboratories) by a previously described method (1Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Rabinowitz J. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 814-815Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar,25Rowe P. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 733-735Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the standard reverse AICARFT assay, the buffer concentrations were the same as for the forward direction. Substrate concentration ranges were 5–500 μm FAICAR and 10–500 μm THF. The reactions were monitored by observing the disappearance of THF as a decrease in absorbance at 298 nm by the same method as for the forward direction, described above. FAICAR was synthesized from AICAR according to a published procedure (22Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the standard IMPCH assay, reaction mixtures contained final concentrations of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 μm FAICAR. hATIC was then added to a final concentration of 10–500 nm to initiate the reaction. The reactions were monitored by observing the appearance of IMP as an increase in absorbance at 248 nm (22Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out using a KinTek® RQF-3 rapid chemical quench apparatus (KinTek Instruments). Reactions were initiated by mixing 15 μl of enzyme with 15 μl of substrate solution containing [3H]AICAR (labeled nonspecifically by tritium exchange, 10–20 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals) and unlabeled 10-fFH4 or by mixing 15 μl of enzyme with 15 μl of substrate solution containing [3H]FAICAR in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 50 mmKCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In all cases, concentrations cited in the text correspond to concentrations after mixing and during the enzymatic reaction. Reaction times ranged from 3 ms to 2 s. All rapid chemical quench experiments were performed at 37 °C unless otherwise noted. Reactions were quenched with 67 μl of triethylamine or 67 μl of 0.5 m formic acid and collected in 1.5-ml tubes containing 70 μl of chloroform. The tubes were immediately vortexed and kept on ice until all of the samples in the set were collected. Samples were then centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min to separate the aqueous and organic phases. The aqueous phase was transferred to a clean tube, lyophilized, and redissolved in 8 μl of H2O for subsequent TLC separation on POLYGRAM® CEL 300 polyethyleneimine/UV254 TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel, GmbH). TLC separation of substrates and products was performed by a modification of the method described previously (18Szabados E. Christopherson R.I. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 401-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped-flow absorbance experiments were performed with a KinTek® SF-2001 (KinTek Instruments) stopped-flow fluorescence/absorbance apparatus. This apparatus has a 1.5-ms dead time, a 0.5-cm path length, and a thermostatted observation cell that was maintained at 25 °C. For the AICARFT reaction in the forward direction, 20 μl of hATIC (5–20 μm) was mixed with 20 μl of a substrate solution containing AICAR (5–200 μm) and 10-fFH4 (from 40 μm to 1 mm). For the reverse AICARFT reaction, 20 μl of hATIC (from 5 to 20 μm) was mixed with 20 μl of a substrate solution containing FAICAR (300 μm) and THF (from 40 μm to 1 mm). Reactions were monitored at 298 nm (absorbance maximum for THF) for the appearance or disappearance of THF on a time scale of up to 2 s. Most experiments were performed under pre-steady-state burst conditions, and an average of 4–5 runs were used for data analysis. The data were collected over a given time interval by a computer using data acquisition and analysis software provided by KinTek instruments. Data were fit to a single exponential or burst equation by nonlinear regression. The combination of rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow methods allowed an accurate interpretation of absorbance signals. The rate constants for individual single turnover rapid chemical quench experiments were determined by fitting the data to a single or double exponential using the curve-fitting program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). The dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rate on substrate concentrations was plotted and fit to a hyperbolic equation to obtain the apparent binding constants for AICAR and 10-fFH4. Using the rate constants and binding constants obtained from these measurements as well as the steady-state parameters determined here as constraints, we then sought to provide a kinetic model that would be consistent with all of the kinetic measurements and possibly provide insights into substrate channeling and/or domain-domain interactions. The kinetic simulation program KINSIM (26Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) was used to model the kinetic data. The data from single turnover experiments were entered asx y pairs and were fit by a trial and error process using the rate constants obtained from the exponential fits of single turnover experiments and the binding constants, K m values, and k cat values obtained in this study. The focus of the modeling was to ascertain, with the rate constants obtained experimentally, whether it was necessary to invoke a channeling step to explain any of the kinetic data. The steady-state spectrophotometric assays for AICARFT and IMPCH activities were used to determine k cat and K m values for the substrates of these activities. The results are shown in TableI. The K m values for AICAR and 10-fFH4 were similar to the values previously reported for this enzyme (1Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Sugita T. Aya H. Ueno M. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The K m value for FAICAR at the IMPCH site is necessarily an approximation because the spectrophotometric assay lacks the sensitivity to accurately determine values less than 1 μm (22Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The value obtained was similar to previously reported results (1Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Steady-state chemical quench techniques were also used to determinek cat values (not shown), and the values obtained were in good agreement with the values obtained spectrophotometrically.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of bifunctional hATICAICARFTIMPCHConstantValueConstantValue K m AICAR10 ± 1 μmK m FAICAR1.4 ± 0.1 μm K m 10-formylFH4100 ± 9 μm k cat2.9 ± 0.4 s−1 k cat6.0 ± 0.8 s−1 Open table in a new tab It has been previously reported by ourselves (21Vergis J.M. Bulock K.G. Fleming K.G. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7727-7733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and others (20Wall M. Shim J.H. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11303-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that the human AICARFT activity exhibits a pre-steady-state burst of FAICAR formation, suggesting that the rate-limiting step is determined, at least in part, by a step occurring after chemical catalysis. These results were confirmed by the use of both rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow absorbance. In all cases, the amplitude of the burst phase was nearly equal to the concentration of enzyme used in the experiments, indicating that close to 100% of the AICARFT catalytic sites were active at the ATIC concentrations used in these experiments (20Wall M. Shim J.H. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11303-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,21Vergis J.M. Bulock K.G. Fleming K.G. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7727-7733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine the apparent binding constants for AICAR and 10-fFH4 at the AICARFT active site, a series of pre-steady-state burst experiments was performed to determine the substrate concentration dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rate. Stopped-flow absorbance was used in these burst experiments to monitor the appearance of THF at 298 nm on a short time scale (<1 s)(Fig.2). This type of experiment was carried out with varying concentrations of one substrate while keeping the other substrate constant under saturating conditions. To examine 10-fFH4 binding, pre-steady-state burst experiments were performed in which AICAR was maintained at a concentration of 200 μm, and the concentration of 10-fFH4 was varied from 40 μm to 1 mm. To examine AICAR binding, the 10-fFH4 concentration was kept at 500 μm, and AICAR was varied from 5–200 μm. The exponential rates from the burst curves (fast phase) were plottedversus substrate concentration, and in each case the resulting curve was fit to a hyperbola from which apparent binding constants were directly obtained. The apparent binding constant for 10-fFH4 was found to be 105 ± 7 μm, and for AICAR it was 22 ± 4 μm. A pre-steady-state burst experiment was performed for the reverse AICARFT reaction using stopped-flow absorbance. The reaction was initiated by mixing 10 μm hATIC with a substrate solution containing 300 μm FAICAR and 300 μm THF. We monitored the disappearance of THF as a decrease in absorbance at 298 nm as it was converted to 10-fFH4 (and FAICAR was converted to AICAR). In the reverse direction, no pre-steady-state burst phase was observed (Fig. 3), suggesting that the rate of chemical catalysis is at least partially rate-limiting. The steady-state spectrophotometric assay was used to determine theK m for FAICAR and tetrahydrofolate at the AICARFT active site. The K m for tetrahydrofolate was determined to be 185 ± 27 μm. TheK m for FAICAR at the AICARFT active site was estimated to be <3.9 ± 1.3 μm. The spectrophotometric assay was not sensitive enough to detect accurate observed rates for FAICAR concentrations under 5 μmbecause assays at these lower concentrations are complicated by the simultaneous depletion of FAICAR by the IMPCH activity. A selective inhibitor of the IMPCH activity was not available at the time of these experiments. The maximum steady-state rate of catalysis in the reverse direction was calculated as 6.7 ± 0.6 s−1, which is faster than the steady-state rate in the forward direction (2.9 ± 0.4 s−1). To investigate the possibility of substrate channeling between the two active sites of ATIC, we needed to determine whether the product from the first reaction, FAICAR, is transferred directly from the AICARFT site to the IMPCH site and not allowed to dissociate from the enzyme. This was done by a series of three single turnover rapid chemical quench experiments performed as illustrated in Fig. 4. The first experiment established the rate of catalysis of the AICARFT activity under single turnover conditions as designated in reaction 1 in Fig. 4. hATIC (80 μm) was mixed with excess 10-fFH4 (500 μm) and a limiting amount of [3H]AICAR (20 μm). The decoupling of the bifunctional reaction is complicated by the fact that FAICAR is the single substrate for the IMPCH activity. In this experiment both [3H]FAICAR and [3H]IMP were formed and detected by TLC. To obtain the rate of FAICAR formation, the total concentration of product formed (FAICAR plus IMP, because any IMP present was formed via FAICAR) was plotted versus time, and the resulting curve was fit to a single exponential. The time course for the formation of [3H]FAICAR is shown in Fig.5. Under these conditions, the rate of catalysis was 62 ± 4 s−1. There was no change in this rate under conditions in which the enzyme concentration was significantly increased, indicating that substrate binding was not rate limiting in these experiments. The second set of single turnover experiments was designed to examine the IMPCH activity of bifunctional ATIC as designated in reaction 2 in Fig. 4. hATIC (40 μm) was mixed with a limiting amount of [3H]FAICAR (20 μm). The time course for the formation of [3H]IMP is shown in Fig.6. Interestingly, this curve was biphasic and fit best to a double exponential. The first phase had an amplitude of 8.4 ± 0.8 μm and a rate of 40 ± 6 s−1. This is likely the rate of catalysis in a single turnover of IMPCH activity. The second phase had an amplitude of 10 ± 1 μm and a rate of 2.3 ± 0.7 s−1, which was similar to but slightly slower than the steady-state rate of IMP formation from FAICAR of 6.0 s−1(Table I). The third set of single turnover experiments was designed to directly measure the rate of conversion of AICAR to FAICAR at the AICARFT active site and the subsequent conversion of FAICAR to IMP at the IMPCH active site (designated as reaction 3 in Fig. 4). If FAICAR dissociates from the AICARFT active site and rebinds at the IMPCH active site, it is probable that it would be detected as an intermediate in the bifunctional reaction. However, if FAICAR is channeled directly from the AICARFT active site to the IMPCH active site, it is unlikely to accumulate during the time course of the overall bifunctional reaction. In these experiments, which were set up in essentially the same manner as the first set of experiments, hATIC (80 μm) was mixed with excess 10-fFH4 (500 μm) and limiting concentrations of [3H]AICAR (20 μm). In this case, the intermediate FAICAR and the ultimate product, IMP, were plotted separately. The time courses of the disappearance of AICAR and the appearance of the intermediate FAICAR and the product, IMP, are shown in Fig. 7. Under these reaction conditions we observed a large accumulation of the intermediate FAICAR, which was subsequently converted to IMP by the end of the time course. This result strongly suggests that channeling of FAICAR from the AICARFT site to the IMPCH site does not occur. The time course for the formation of IMP in this experiment was very similar to the IMP formation in a single turnover of IMPCH activity. This curve was also biphasic and was best fit to a double exponential. The first phase had an amplitude of 8.3 ± 2.4 μm and a rate of 30 ± 9 s−1, and the second phase had an amplitude of 10.3 ± 2.1 μm and a rate of 4.1 ± 1.6 s−1. Finding that the rate of IMPCH catalysis is the same in a single turnover of IMPCH activity and a single turnover of the bifunctional ATIC supports a mechanism that does not involve FAICAR channeling. It also suggests a lack of any domain-domain communication that would result in rate enhancement of the IMPCH activity in the bifunctional ATIC reaction. Finally, this result suggests that the rate-limiting step in the overall bifunctional reaction is the release of THF from the AICARFT active site. Pre-steady-state burst experiments indicated that it is likely that the rate-limiting step of the AICARFT reaction (2.9 ± 0.4 s−1, which is also limiting in the overall bifunctional reaction) occurs after the chemical conversion of AICAR to FAICAR. Because the rate of IMP formation in a single turnover of the bifunctional reaction is not limited by the rate-limiting step of the AICARFT reaction, it is likely that the rate-limiting step is at least partially determined by the release of THF or a conformational change associated with THF release under the conditions studied here. The individual rate constants, equilibrium constants, and steady-state parameters measured in this kinetic study are summarized by the mechanism shown in Fig.8. This mechanism was used to construct the kinetic model for the hATIC bifunctional single turnover experiments using KINSIM (Fig. 7). We have previously reported that the substrate binding to the AICARFT active site follows an ordered sequential mechanism with 10-fFH4 binding first (27Beardsley G.P. Rayl E.A. Gunn K. Moroson B.A. Seow H. Anderson K.S. Vergis J.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 431: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Attempts were made to confirm this by performing substrate trapping experiments. Unfortunately, these experiments were unsuccessful because of our inability to trap either substrate at the active site. This suggests that the rate constants for the binding and dissociation of one or both substrates may be too fast to be determined by this method. Attempts were also made to directly measure rate constants for substrate binding by stopped-flow fluorescence; however, no intrinsic protein fluorescence change was observed upon the addition of either substrate. Nevertheless, based on our previous results, a justification was provided for a model in which 10-fFH4 binds first. To account for the biphasic behavior in the time course of IMP formation in the single turnover experiments, it was necessary to include two populations of IMPCH active sites. This was accomplished by including a ligand bound in 50% of the sites. It was assumed that a ligand bound in the IMPCH active sites would not affect the AICARFT activity in a single turnover. The rate of dissociation of the prebound ligand was taken as 2.3 s−1, which was the rate of the slower phase of the biphasic IMPCH curve from the single turnover experiments. The release of THF was taken as a rate-limiting step in the bifunctional reaction, i.e. 2.9 s−1. There was no need to invoke a channeling step or any rate enhancement due to domain-domain communication to explain any of the kinetic data obtained in this study. The application of rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow absorbance to the study of bifunctional human ATIC has allowed a direct analysis of the kinetics for the conversion of AICAR to IMP. This study has provided definitive evidence that the channeling of FAICAR from the AICARFT active site to the IMPCH active site does not occur. This evidence consists of a few key points. First, the large accumulation of FAICAR in a single turnover of the bifunctional reaction suggests that FAICAR dissociates from the AICARFT site and rebinds at the IMPCH site. In cases wherein channeling has been proven (11Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the channeling step is very fast (>1000 s−1), and there is very little or no detectable amount of the intermediate product observed in a single turnover. A second important result was that the rate of formation of IMP was the same in the bifunctional reaction (40 ± 6 s−1) as it was in the single turnover of IMPCH activity when FAICAR came from the bulk solution (30 ± 9 s−1). In addition to lending further evidence against a substrate channeling hypothesis, this also suggests a lack of any domain-domain communication that would cause rate enhancement of the second activity as has been shown to occur in some proven examples of substrate channeling. Interestingly, the time course for the formation of IMP in a single turnover of IMPCH activity was found to be biphasic and was best fit to a double exponential. This was also the case for the IMP formation in a single turnover of the bifunctional reaction. It seems likely that the faster phase is the actual rate of IMPCH catalysis. There are at least two possible explanations for the observation of a second, slower phase. One possibility is that there are two populations of IMPCH active sites with different conformations. In this case, the faster phase would be due to catalysis by the population of sites in an active conformation. The slower phase could represent catalysis by a population in a less active conformation or the rate of the conformational change from an inactive to an active conformation. A second possibility is that human ATIC contains a ligand bound in a fraction of the IMPCH active sites. If this is the case, the faster phase of the biphasic curve would represent IMPCH catalysis by the unoccupied fraction of active sites, and the slower phase would represent the rate of dissociation for the bound ligand. Recent crystallographic data by Wilson and co-workers at the Scripps Research Institute (28Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggest that the later possibility is likely to be the case. Avian ATIC was found to crystallize as a dimer with a purine nucleotide-like density in one of the two IMPCH active sites. It was concluded that the ligand must have been acquired during the expression of the enzyme in E. coli because no nucleotides were added during the purification or crystallization procedures. The human ATIC used in our experiments was purified by the same method as the avian ATIC. Experiments are underway to determine the identity of the ligand in the avian structure as well as to investigate whether this is the cause of the biphasic IMPCH activity observed in single turnover experiments with human ATIC. The kinetic mechanism shown in Fig. 8 summarizes the individual rate and equilibrium constants that were obtained by this study and used as constraints in the modeling performed with KINSIM. When KINSIM was used to construct the models, there was no need to include any steps for channeling or for rate enhancement to explain any of the data obtained in this study. Thus, we conclude that there is no kinetic evidence to support a substrate channeling hypothesis for hATIC. This is consistent with structural studies that show no evidence of a tunnel or cavity connecting the two active sites to form a channel (28Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, any potential pathway between the AICARFT and IMPCH sites is apparently precluded by the presence of two overlapping β-loops that lie between the two domains. We have also ruled out the possibility of domain-domain communication by the finding that there does not appear to be any rate enhancement of the IMPCH activity in a single turnover of the bifunctional ATIC reaction. Occupation of the IMPCH site by a specific inhibitor was previously shown not to have an effect on AICARFT activity (20Wall M. Shim J.H. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11303-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which gives further support to this conclusion. These conclusions lead to the consideration of other potential functional advantages to the conserved bifunctionality of ATIC. As we have again shown here, it has been previously reported (20Wall M. Shim J.H. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11303-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that the AICARFT activity favors the reverse reaction in the steady-state (2.9 s−1 forward versus 6.7 s−1reverse). The IMPCH reaction, however, highly favors the forward direction. Perhaps the advantage of linking the two activities is to draw the equilibrium of the AICARFT reaction toward the formation of FAICAR by subsequently converting the FAICAR to IMP. Having the two enzyme activities linked guarantees a stoichiometric amount of the IMPCH active sites available to convert any FAICAR formed to IMP. One could argue that the close proximity (∼50 Å apart) (28Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) of the two active sites provides an increased local concentration of IMPCH active sites. Szabados and Christopherson (19Szabados E. Christopherson R.I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have performed theoretical calculations that suggested that the local concentration of FAICAR at the IMPCH active sites was higher than the FAICAR in bulk solution (added exogenously), based on the results of their steady-state experiments. Another possible advantage to the bifunctionality of ATIC is more structural in nature. We have recently shown that in solution hATIC exists in a monomer/dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of 240 nm at 4 °C and that the dimeric form is required for AICARFT activity (21Vergis J.M. Bulock K.G. Fleming K.G. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7727-7733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of avian ATIC has been described as an “extensively intertwined” homodimer with a considerable dimer interface for a protein of its size burying 4929 Å2 per monomer, of which the IMPCH domain makes up 38% (28Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). With such a large percentage of the dimer interface from the IMPCH domain, it is possible that the physical linking of these two activities on the same polypeptide helps to keep the protein in the dimeric form required for AICARFT activity. To test the possibility that there is a kinetic or structural advantage to having AICARFT and IMPCH activities physically linked, we plan to perform reconstitution experiments with the AICARFT and IMPCH truncation mutants that we have described previously (1Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have provided definitive kinetic evidence that substrate channeling does not occur with bifunctional human ATIC. We have also provided a detailed kinetic analysis of this enzyme, which can provide a basis for studies of catalytic mechanism as well as aid in the design characterization of potential inhibitors of these important enzyme activities. We thank Dr. James E. Vergis for helpful discussions and suggestions."

In reporter assays, Arix together with activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) potentiates DBH gene transcription. We have evaluated whether post-translational modification of Arix regulates PKA-mediated DBH gene transcription.

Neurotransmitter phenotype is represented by the ability of a neuron to synthesize, release, and uptake the neurotransmitter. Therefore, the expression of a biosynthetic enzyme and/or vesicular transporter in its given neuron defines a neurotransmitter identity. A coordinated array of gene expression ultimately defines the phenotype of any neuron. Indeed, many transcription factors have been shown to play a key role in deciding the fate of a progenitor cell and in linking the cell to a variety of extracellular stimuli during development. Transcription factors of the homeodomain and basic-helix-loop-helix classes of proteins are frequently involved in the determination of cell type specificity (1Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Marquardt T. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 2001; 106: 651-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Noradrenergic neurons are characterized by the coexpression of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)1 and DBH. TH, the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, catalyzes the production of dihydroxyphenylalanine, which is in turn converted to dopamine by amino acid decarboxylase. DBH is the terminal enzyme that produces noradrenaline from dopamine; thus, the expression of DBH is essential for determination of noradrenergic cells. For specification of noradrenergic neurons, the paired-like homeodomain transcription factors, Arix/Phox2a and NBPhox/Phox2b, appear to act in concert to regulate noradrenergic traits in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (3Pattyn A. Morin X. Cremer H. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1997; 124: 4065-4075PubMed Google Scholar). Arix and NBPhox are closely related homeodomain proteins that share significant amino acid sequence homology, including 100% identity in the homeodomain and 50% identity in the N terminus to the homeodomain. Coordinate action of Arix and NBPhox is essential for the proper development of central and peripheral noradrenergic cells. Targeted deletion analyses of Phox2a (4Guo S. Brush J. Teraoka H.

Nature. 1999; 399: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) demonstrate the necessity of these genes to direct noradrenergic neuronal differentiation. Despite this implication, forced expression of Phox2a is only able to induce the expression of TH but not DBH in mammalian neural crest stem cell cultures. Importantly, the expression of both TH and DBH is evoked by Phox2a only together with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and forskolin, which increases intracellular cAMP levels (8Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J.F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, in chicken and zebrafish, forced expression of Phox2a is sufficient to promote the generation of ectopic noradrenergic neurons that express TH, DBH, and pan-neuronal genes (4Guo S. Brush J. Teraoka H. Goddard A. Wilson S. Mullins M. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9Stanke M. Junghans D. Geissen M.

Dev. 2001; 108: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These experimental findings in vivo and in ovo suggest that Phox2a requires an additional factor and/or an environmental stimulus that is present in the embryo in order to potentiate activation of target genes.Phox2a expression is maintained in adult noradrenergic cells, where it likely functions to sustain the expression of the genes necessary for noradrenaline biosynthesis. The transcription of TH and DBH is regulated postnatally by environmental stimuli, such as stress, which trigger intracellular signaling pathways (11Sabban E.L. Kvetnansky R. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 91-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The interaction between Phox2a and signaling molecules is likely to extend beyond neuronal development and function to modulate neurotransmitter biosynthesis in the adult as well. In addition to its function in neurotransmitter identity, Arix/Phox2a may also play a critical role in the development of midbrain motor nuclei. A mutation in the N-terminal region of human ARIX results in congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 2, believed to result from the maldevelopment of cranial nerve nuclei nII, nIV, and nVI (12Nakano M. Yamada K. Fain J. Sener E. Selleck C. Awad A. Zwaan J. Mullaney P. Bosley T. Engle E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).In addition to the genetic manipulation studies, we and others (13Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Adachi M. Browne D. Lewis E.J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated a direct link between Phox2 transcription factors and DBH gene expression by analyses of the 5′-upstream promoter of the DBH gene. In previous studies, we found three homeodomain protein recognition sites (HD1, -2, and -3) for Arix and NBPhox within the proximal rat DBH promoter. Reporter assays using mutant promoters showed that all three HD sites are integrated and interdependent in the regulation of DBH transcription. Two of the homeodomain protein recognition sites of the rat DBH promoter, HD1 and HD2, lie within a genetic regulatory element, DB1, that mediates PKA responsiveness, noradrenergic tissue specificity, and Arix-dependent activation of DBH transcription (13Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L. Lewis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adjacent to sites HD1 and -2 on the DB1 enhancer is a cAMP-response element/activator protein 1 (CRE/AP1) site. Enhancement of DBH transcription by second messengers occurs in catecholaminergic cell lines expressing endogenous DBH and is mediated through the CRE/AP1 element on the DBH promoter (17Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24065-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Binding of AP1 family proteins, including c-Fos and c-Jun, to the CRE/AP1 site is necessary to achieve transcriptional synergism of Arix with the PKA pathway (17Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24065-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, recruitment of the coactivator, CRE-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), appears to be involved in the DBH promoter activation by Arix and PKA (18Swanson D.J. Adachi M. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2911-2923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CBP physically interacts with the transactivation domain of Arix and augments Arix-mediated DBH transcription in a PKA-dependent manner. However, it is unknown how Arix acts through multiple HD sites to integrate the activation of the PKA pathway. One plausible mechanism would involve post-translational modification of Arix in response to PKA activation.Protein phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification to modulate the function of proteins in response to the extracellular stimuli. In general, the phosphorylation state of a transcription factor may influence its activity by modifying nuclear translocation, DNA binding, or transactivation potential (19Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 20Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). A few cases of homeodomain proteins whose function is regulated by phosphorylation have been reported. The Cut homeodomain transcription factor is phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II and protein kinase C in the Cut repeats, a DNA-binding motif in addition to the homeodomain, causing a reduction in DNA binding and transcriptional repression (21Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24862-24868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Coqueret O. Martin N. Berube G. Rabbat M. Litchfield D.W. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2561-2566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Casein kinase II is also known to phosphorylate the homeodomain of Csx/Nkx2.5, increasing DNA binding (23Kasahara H. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PKA can directly phosphorylate the homeodomain of Oct-1 in vivo in a mitosis-specific manner (24Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 254: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Evidence of phosphorylation of homeodomain proteins further extends to functional relevance in vivo. Regulated phosphorylation of DrosophilaAntennapedia by casein kinase II plays an important role in the appropriate development of thorax and abdomen during embryogenesis (25Jaffe L. Ryoo H.D. Mann R.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These developmental influences appear to result from the ability of Antennapedia to bind DNA cooperatively with another homeodomain protein, Extradenticle, upon phosphorylation of Antennapedia.Natural target genes for most of the homeodomain proteins are unknown; therefore, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms that achieve their functional specificity. In the present study, we took advantage of the known in vivo target gene for Arix, and we have characterized the molecular mechanism of Arix in the activation of DBH gene transcription in coordination with activation of the PKA pathway. We found that Arix is a constitutive phosphoprotein and that the phosphorylation state of Arix is dramatically decreased in response to activation of the PKA pathway. PKA activation leads to increased DNA binding activity of Arix, which is abolished by pretreatment with phosphatase inhibitors. Collectively, the present study suggests that a dephosphorylated form of Arix is transcriptionally active and that the regulated post-translational modification is a crucial event to functionally activate Arix in response to an extracellular stimuli. This is the first demonstration of functional regulation of a paired-type homeodomain protein by phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONArix has been suggested to serve as an integrator that coordinates multiple extracellular signals to mediate the expression of characteristic terminal differentiation genes for noradrenergic neurons in developing nervous systems (8Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J.F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Swanson D.J. Adachi M. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2911-2923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The present study gives insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional activity of Arix in coordination with the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in the activation of DBH transcription. We demonstrate that Arix is constitutively phosphorylated at multiple serine residues in cell culture. Stimulation of the PKA pathway leads to a significant decrease in the phosphorylation state of Arix, which coincides with increased DNA binding activity of Arix to the multiple HD sites within the DBH proximal promoter. The increase in DNA binding activity of Arix is abolished by phosphatase inhibitor treatments. Consistently, the phosphatase treatment reduces the PKA-stimulated DBH promoter activity mediated by Arix. Taken together, the present findings imply that the transcriptional activity of Arix is negatively regulated by phosphorylation and that activation of the PKA pathway causes dephosphorylation of Arix, converting it to a transcriptionally competent form, and potentiating DBH gene transcription.Possible Kinases and Phosphatases That Regulate Phosphorylation of ArixThe regulation of transcription from the rat DBH promoter by Arix plus activation of the PKA pathway entails multiple events. Recruitment of AP1 proteins, Fos and Jun, to the CRE/AP1 site is a part of the mechanism of PKA-stimulated DBH transcription (17Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24065-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the transcriptional coactivator, CBP, a signal-dependent facilitator of PKA-stimulated DBH transcription (18Swanson D.J. Adachi M. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2911-2923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is also involved. The present results further extend the molecular mechanism of DBH gene transcription by demonstrating that the post-translational modification of Arix is regulated by PKA and influences its DNA binding activity. Consistent with the fact that phosphorylation of Arix is constitutive under basal conditions, PKA does not directly phosphorylate Arix.The kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Arix, as well as the regulated phosphorylation site, remains to be determined. The identification of the kinase and regulated phosphorylation site is likely to be complicated, because the experiments herein suggest multiple phosphoserine sites, and yet, using several search programs, no consensus sites for phosphoserine were identified within the appropriate region of the protein. The regulated phosphorylation site should occur within the N-terminal or homeodomain regions of Arix, because these domains are sufficient to interact synergistically with PKA in the activation of DBH transcription (14Adachi M. Browne D. Lewis E.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there are 9 serine residues in the N-terminal segment of Arix and 1 in the homeodomain (Fig 7 A). Candidate kinases may be one of the proline-directed kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase or MAP kinases, because the N-terminal section of Arix, which contains the transcriptional activation domain, is proline-rich, with serines embedded within the proline-rich segments. Further suggestion of the involvement of MAP kinases as negative regulators of DBH transcription arises from studies using leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor. These factors will induce a neurotransmitter-phenotype switch in sympathetic neurons from noradrenergic to cholinergic (28Francis N.J. Landis S.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). During the phenotype switch, leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor cause down-regulation of DBH gene transcription, which can be blocked by a MAP kinase inhibitor, PD98059 (29Dziennis, S., Hofmann, J., Lewis, E., and Habecker, B. (2001) inProceedings of the 31st Annual Meeting Society for Neuroscience, San Diego, CA, November 10–15, 2001 (Abstr. 364.27), Society for Neuroscience, Washington D.C.Google Scholar). This observation suggests that activation of MAP kinase negatively regulates DBH transcription. It is plausible that the growth factors present in the local environment of a cell maintain a basal level of MAP kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates Arix. When cells encounter another environmental cue that activates the PKA pathway, phosphorylated Arix is converted to a dephosphorylated form, gaining stronger transcriptional activity and enhancing DBH transcription.The phosphatase that dephosphorylates Arix in response to PKA stimulation is also not identified, although protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase, is an attractive candidate. A primary target of okadaic acid is PP2A (30Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and thus the ability of low concentrations of okadaic acid to inhibit the DNA binding activity of Arix and reduce PKA responsiveness suggests involvement of PP2A. The regulatory B subunit of PP2A determines the substrate specificity of the enzyme. In particular, B56δ is highly expressed in brain and concentrated in the nucleus as a phosphoprotein in vivo(31McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest that phosphorylation of PP2A by PKA positively regulates its phosphatase activity (32Usui H. Inoue R. Tanabe O. Nishito Y. Shimizu M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Takeda M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Increasing lines of evidence suggest that protein phosphatases play an important role in developmental processes (33Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar,34Stoker A.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Partial inhibition of binding and transcriptional activation was also observed with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate. Repeated phosphoamino acid analyses of phosphorylated Arix did not reveal phosphotyrosine, suggesting that the effect of vanadate may be indirect. A conserved tyrosine in the homeodomain (Tyr-25) was altered to phenylalanine by mutagenesis but did not produce a constitutively active transcription factor, as would be expected if it were the regulated phosphoamino acid (data not shown). The effect of vanadate suggests that PKA stimulates multiple phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades which affect Arix activity both by direct and indirect pathways.Dephosphorylation of Arix Positively Regulates Its Transcriptional PotentialAs demonstrated by EMSA (Fig 3), the DNA binding activity of Arix is greatly enhanced by stimulation of the PKA pathway, which appears to lead to dephosphorylation of Arix. In addition, serine/threonine as well as tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor treatments abrogated the enhanced DNA binding of Arix, suggesting that phosphorylation at both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues play an inhibitory role in DNA binding. In vitro studies suggest that the homeodomain can be phosphorylated. In principle, phosphorylation in the DNA binding domain introduces a negative charge, which is unfavorable for DNA binding because the backbone of DNA is negatively charged in character. If phosphorylation occurs within or close to the homeodomain of Arix, removal of phosphorylation would be an obligatory step to confer DNA binding activity of Arix. With regard to the homeodomain proteins, Berry and Gehring (35Berry M. Gehring W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) reported that theDrosophila Hox protein, Sex Combs Reduced (SCR), which determines the identity of specific segments, is regulated by phosphorylation. In vivo analyses using transgenic flies revealed that a mutant form of SCR mimicking constitutive phosphorylation in the N-terminal arm of the homeodomain is functionally inactive. Dephosphorylation is apparently necessary to switch SCR in an active state, possibly by PP2A, because a yeast two-hybrid screen revealed the interaction between SCR and PP2A.The functional importance of the phosphorylation state of Arix is also suggested by in vitro protein-protein interaction assays (Fig. 3). Homo- and heteromerization of Arix and NBPhox in vitro occurs preferably in the dephosphorylated forms of these proteins, rather than the phosphorylated forms. Whether binding of Arix to DNA requires protein dimerization is unknown at present. If this is the case, phosphorylation at the dimerization interface may decrease dimerization, thereby inhibiting DNA binding. Alternatively, because the DBH proximal promoter carries multiple homeodomain recognition sites, multimerization of Arix and NBPhox may confer cooperativity in DNA binding. Upon stimulation of the PKA pathway, dephosphorylated Arix may undergo multimer formation, stabilizing the transcriptional machinery at the promoter, thereby enhancing DBH transcription.Arix May Integrate Extracellular Signals through the cAMP/PKA Pathway to Enhance DBH Gene Transcription during Noradrenergic Differentiation and Environmental StimuliDuring embryogenesis, noradrenergic differentiation is believed to be triggered by BMPs, secreted proteins of the transforming growth factor β superfamily. Exposure to BMPs leads to the sequential induction of Mash1 and Phox2a/Arix expression (8Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J.F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). However, induction of TH and DBH expression in mammalian neuronal crest stem cell culture requires the activation of PKA, through the elevation of intracellular cAMP (8Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J.F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and cAMP potentiates the influence of BMPs in inducing TH expression in avian neural crest cultures (38Bilodeau M. Boulineau T. Hullinger R. Andrisani O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In other developmental processes such as renal branching morphogenesis (39Gupta I.R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Phan T. Macias-Silva M. Zhou X. Whiteside C. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26305-26314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and chondrogenesis (40Lee Y.S. Chuong C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), BMP2 has been demonstrated to increase PKA activity. Therefore, it is plausible that BMP2/4, which have been shown to induce the expression of TH and DBH in vivo (8Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J.F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 41Reissmann E. Ernsberger U. Francis-West P. Rueger D. Brickell P. Rohrer H. Development. 1996; 122: 2079-2088PubMed Google Scholar), can stimulate the cAMP/PKA pathway in noradrenergic precursor cells.Based on our results, the model for the regulation of DBH gene transcription is outlined in Fig. 7 B. Arix, the noradrenergic tissue-specific transcription factor, is present in a constitutively phosphorylated form under the basal condition, which is a transcriptionally reduced state. Phosphorylated Arix has weak DNA binding activity that contributes to the minimal activation of DBH transcription. When cells encounter an environmental cue that activates the cAMP/PKA pathway, specific protein phosphatases are activated, which will dephosphorylate Arix at the homeodomain or the N terminus. Dephosphorylated Arix is in an active state by acquiring strong DNA binding activity. As a result, dephosphorylated Arix becomes competent to fully activate DBH transcription. This mechanism may be active during development or in mature noradrenergic cells. The present study demonstrates that the phosphorylation state of Arix shifts its functional activity through DNA binding and that Arix may serve as a signal-dependent tissue-specific transcription factor that consolidates an extracellular cue, promoting a noradrenergic fate and regulating noradrenaline biosynthesis. In the central and peripheral nervous systems, identity of neurotransmitter is a pivotal attribute for proper function of a neuron. Neurotransmitter phenotype is represented by the ability of a neuron to synthesize, release, and uptake the neurotransmitter. Therefore, the expression of a biosynthetic enzyme and/or vesicular transporter in its given neuron defines a neurotransmitter identity. A coordinated array of gene expression ultimately defines the phenotype of any neuron. Indeed, many transcription factors have been shown to play a key role in deciding the fate of a progenitor cell and in linking the cell to a variety of extracellular stimuli during development. Transcription factors of the homeodomain and basic-helix-loop-helix classes of proteins are frequently involved in the determination of cell type specificity (1Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Marquardt T. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 2001; 106: 651-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Noradrenergic neurons are characterized by the coexpression of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)1 and DBH. TH, the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, catalyzes the production of dihydroxyphenylalanine, which is in turn converted to dopamine by amino acid decarboxylase. DBH is the terminal enzyme that produces noradrenaline from dopamine; thus, the expression of DBH is essential for determination of noradrenergic cells. For specification of noradrenergic neurons, the paired-like homeodomain transcription factors, Arix/Phox2a and NBPhox/Phox2b, appear to act in concert to regulate noradrenergic traits in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (3Pattyn A. Morin X. Cremer H. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1997; 124: 4065-4075PubMed Google Scholar). Arix and NBPhox are closely related homeodomain proteins that share significant amino acid sequence homology, including 100% identity in the homeodomain and 50% identity in the N terminus to the homeodomain.

Here, we describe a bifunctional repair enzyme from Arabidopsis (named AtZDP) that recognizes DNA strand breaks and catalyzes the removal of 3′-end-blocking lesions. The isolated C-terminal domain of AtZDP is by itself competent for 3′-end processing, but not for strand break recognition. The N-terminal domain instead contains three Cys3-His zinc fingers and recognizes various kinds of damaged double-stranded DNA. Gapped DNA molecules are preferential targets of AtZDP, which bends them by ∼73° upon binding, as measured by atomic force microscopy. Potential partners of AtZDP were identified in theArabidopsis genome using the human single-strand break repairosome as a reference.

Gap filling and ligation by these enzymes can only occur if 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate termini are available at the boundaries of the damaged site. However, DNA strand breaks often bear unconventional end groups such as 3′-phosphate or 3′-phosphoglycolate as well as 5′-hydroxyl terminal moieties that must be removed or phosphorylated prior to reparative polymerization and/or ligation (1Friedberg E.C.

DNA repair enzymes specialized in this task have been identified in a number of species ranging from bacteria to mammals (3Ward J.E. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 2.

Interestingly, a single PARP-like zinc finger (enabling binding to nicked DNA) is also present in the repair enzyme DNA ligase III (15Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Ménissier-de Murcia J.

A related DNA 3′-phosphatase has also been described inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which by contrast does not include 5′-kinase activity (17Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. J. Biol.

Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 20-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), organisms that are particularly exposed to a number of potentially genotoxic agents such as ozone, UV light, and environmental pollutants. Genes encoding PARP-homologous proteins with a structural organization resembling that of animal PARPs have been described in higher plants (20Mahajan P.B. Zuo Z. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Babiychuk E. Cottrill P.B. Storozhenko S. Fuangthong M. Chen Y. O'Farrell M.K. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Kushnir S. Plant J. 1998; 15: 635-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the first plant enzyme catalyzing the repair of DNA 3′-blocking lesions has been identified in maize (22Betti M. Petrucco S. Bolchi A. Dieci G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18038-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This enzyme (named ZmDP2) shares homology with polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatases, but, similarly to theS. cerevisiae enzyme, is devoid of an associated 5′-kinase activity. A conceptually assembled cDNA sequence from theArabidopsis genome encodes the closest homolog of ZmDP2 (22Betti M. Petrucco S. Bolchi A. Dieci G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18038-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Relative to all known DNA 3′-repair proteins, the predictedArabidopsis polypeptide includes a long N-terminal extension (532 amino acids) with sequence features suggestive of a role in DNA binding. To verify such a prediction and to gain new insight into SSBR in plants, we have isolated and functionally characterized this novel, putative 3′-end-processing enzyme from Arabidopsis. This enzyme (named AtZDP for A rabidopsis t haliana zinc fingerDNA 3′-phosphoesterase) is a multifunctional modular protein with a C-terminal 3′-phosphoesterase domain and an N-terminal DNA-binding domain containing three PARP-like zinc fingers. AtZDP specifically binds to gap sites and sharply bends its target DNA. This structural distortion, which marks damaged DNA, may also act as a nucleation center for the subsequent assembly of a fully competent DNA repair complex. Based on this view, on the peculiar structural organization of AtZDP, and on its unique ability to act as a nick-sensing 3′-phosphoesterase, we also carried out a whole genome analysis aimed to identify all the other putative components that are required to build up a fully competent SSBR complex in plants.DISCUSSIONThis work identifies AtZDP as the first nick-sensing DNA 3′-phosphoesterase thus far described in any organism. AtZDP is a multifunctional DNA-binding enzyme that recognizes and bends damaged DNA carrying SSBs and that catalyzes the repair of 3′-blocking terminal lesions. Based on its characteristic zinc finger domain structure and peculiar functional capabilities, we suggest that AtZDP acts as a nick-sensing and 3′-end-restoring component of a multiprotein DNA repair complex in plants.AtZDP Identifies a Novel Family of Nick-sensing DNA 3′-PhosphoesterasesTo our knowledge, AtZDP is the first DNA repair enzyme embodying three Cys3-His zinc fingers. An AtZDP homolog (ZmDP2) has been previously isolated in maize based on its ability to complement diphosphonucleoside phosphatase mutants. This maize protein appeared to be endowed with only the 3′-phosphoesterase function (22Betti M. Petrucco S. Bolchi A. Dieci G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18038-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). More recent experiments indicate, however, the presence of a nick- sensing DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal part of ZmDP2. 6S. Petrucco, unpublished data. AtZDP belongs to the DNA 3′-phosphatase family, and conserved motifs in its sequence suggests that it covalently binds substrate DNA via the first aspartate of the motif DDDD-1 (34Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Rossolini G.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similar to maize ZmDP2 (22Betti M. Petrucco S. Bolchi A. Dieci G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18038-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), AtZDP lacks 5′-kinase activity, does not discriminate between single-stranded or duplex substrates, and is more active on 3′-phosphate than on 3′-phosphoglycolate end groups. These three functional features, in addition to autonomous DNA binding, delineate AtZDP as the first member of a new family of DNA repair enzymes thus far unique to plants. Nick-sensing ability and the lack of kinase activity distinguish it from human polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase and its fission yeast homolog, which appear to require mediator proteins (PARP-1 and XRCC1 in humans) for damaged DNA recognition and the diesterase activity of which on 3′-phosphoglycolate-blocked terminal lesions has not yet been documented. Despite the common lack of kinase activity, AtZDP also differs from the S. cerevisiae DNA 3′-phosphatase Tpp1, which is devoid of any recognizable nick-sensing domain, is not capable of 3′-phosphoglycolate end processing, and strongly discriminates against single-stranded 3′-phosphate-blocked substrates (18Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a substantial functional redundancy exists for the repair of 3′-terminal lesions, with different enzymes bearing distinct, yet partially overlapping substrate specificities. This is clearly the case in yeast, where in addition to Tpp1, two additional enzymes, the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases Apn1 and Apn2, have been shown to catalyze the removal of various 3′-blocking lesions, including those bearing a 3′-phosphoglycolate group. An apurinic endonuclease redox protein (Arp), as yet uncharacterized with respect to its DNA repair capabilities, has previously been identified inArabidopsis (35Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It will thus be interesting to find out whether a similar redundancy, especially regarding blocking lesions other than a 3′-phosphate, also exists in plants.Damaged DNA Recognition by AtZDP Zinc FingersAtZDP zinc fingers act as a “nick sensor” and sharply bend target DNA upon binding to single-strand lesions. Interestingly, a similar degree of bending has been reported for PARP binding to nicked DNA sites (12Le Cam E. Fack F. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Cognet J.A. Barbin A. Sarantoglou V. Revet B. Delain E. de Murcia G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1062-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as if a bent conformation of target DNA were a sort of general prerequisite for the correct positioning of downstream-acting DNA repair components. In fact, it has been proposed that the human repair complex binds to the inside of DNA bends generated by PARP at SSB sites. In this way, it would serve as a “docking” platform for repair components, while still allowing access to SSB termini on the outside of the bend. Considering that one PARP-like finger is sufficient for nick sensing (15Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Leppard J., Au, K. Chen J. de Murcia G. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21679-21687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that multiple fingers, as in AtZDP and PARP, may serve additional roles in the control of genome stability. Indeed, the specific binding of AtZDP to single- and double-stranded DNA ends may suggest that this enzyme is involved in the assembly of multipurpose strand break repair complexes.Repair functions by PARP fingers seem to be independent from the associated enzyme activity. In keeping with this view, the DNA 3′-phosphoesterase activity of AtZDP does not require the nick-binding function, and conversely, strand break recognition by its zinc fingers does not discriminate between blocked or unmodified 3′ termini. Furthermore, we found that double-stranded DNA activates AtZDP phosphoesterase activity regardless of the presence of the zinc fingers, thus indicating that AtZDP fingers are not directly involved in either substrate recognition or DNA-dependent enzyme activation. It has been proposed that in addition to nick sensing, the zinc finger of DNA ligase III contributes to stabilization of substrate binding to the enzyme active site (15Mackey Z.B. Niedergang C. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Leppard J., Au, K. Chen J. de Murcia G. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21679-21687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In turn, PARP fingers have been shown to enhance the effect of activator DNA on PARP enzyme activity (36Ikejima M. Noguchi S. Yamashita R. Ogura T. Sugimura T. Gill D.M. Miwa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21907-21913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that also in the case of AtZDP, both substrate and activator DNA binding to the catalytic domain are similarly optimized by the three PARP-like zinc fingers.Single-strand Break Repair in PlantsThe human SSBR complex has recently been shown to be composed of five interacting modular proteins that appear to coordinately operate in DNA repair (8Whitehouse C.J. Taylor R.M. Thistlethwaite A. Zhang H. Karimi-Busheri F. Lasko D.D. Weinfeld M. Caldecott K.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 107-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that AtZDP is a modular polypeptide sharing structural motifs with animal SSBR proteins, we reasoned that a similar multiprotein complex might operate in plants. Having in mind the unique modular composition of AtZDP and thus the likely existence of differences in complex assembly and modular assortment, we searched theArabidopsis thaliana Database for putative components of a plant SSB repairosome. A list of Arabidopsispolypeptides that we believe may be part of such a complex is presented in Fig. 7, together with their predicted catalytic domains and protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction motifs. Candidate XRCC1-like and DNA polymerase β genes were already annotated in the Arabidopsis thalianaDatabase.5 Similar to its human homolog, the XRCC1-like polypeptide of Arabidopsis is predicted to contain multiple protein-protein interaction BRCT (BRCA1C-terminal) modules. Interestingly, similar BRCT modules are also present in the putative DNA polymerase β as well as in a member of one of the two PARP families thus far described in plants (21Babiychuk E. Cottrill P.B. Storozhenko S. Fuangthong M. Chen Y. O'Farrell M.K. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Kushnir S. Plant J. 1998; 15: 635-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No human polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase homolog other than AtZDP is encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. Accordingly, the only putative 5′-kinase of Arabidopsis (17Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15073-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) does not bear an associated 3′-phosphatase domain. Finally, various candidate sequences sharing strong similarity with the DNA ligase catalytic domain, but all lacking a PARP-like zinc finger, were obtained from a homology search of the Arabidopsis thaliana Database using human DNA ligase III as a query. By excluding a number of sequences belonging to either class I or IV DNA ligases, we propose the polypeptide encoded by the At1g66730gene as the best candidate for a DNA ligase involved in SSBR in plants. In fact, in addition to a high-scoring DNA ligase-like domain, the At1g66730 polypeptide contains an N-terminal region that is conserved within a broad group of eukaryotic DNA repair components and is thought to target enzyme activity for nucleic acids in the context of various lesion-specific repair pathways (37Dronkert M.L. de Wit J.

Cell. 2001; 105: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar).A minimal set of five putative repair components potentially capable of cooperating with AtZDP in the assembly of a fully competent SSBR complex is encoded by the Arabidopsis genome. Despite the occurrence of common DNA recognition and protein-protein interaction modules, the detailed architecture of this complex is likely to be substantially different from that of the mammalian SSB repairosome. As exemplified by the unique domain organization of AtZDP, most of such diversity probably originates from the dissimilar assortment of functionally homologous modules among individual repair components. Therefore, following experimental validation of the actual functionality of the components identified by this whole genome analysis, future studies will have to address the mode and order of recruitment of such components into a functional repair complex. Because of the PARP-like DNA damage recognition capacity of AtZDP, it will be especially interesting to determine whether this nick-sensing 3′-phosphoesterase can act as an autonomous nucleation center for SSBR complex assembly and how additional components are recruited into such a complex. Ultimately, the in vitro reconstitution of a fully competent plant repairosome will lead to understanding the physiological significance and far-reaching adaptive implications of the unique SSBR strategy operating in plants. DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs)1 caused by endogenously produced reactive oxygen species as well as by a number of oxidizing agents, ionizing radiation, or radiomimetic chemicals are a major source of genomic instability (1Friedberg E.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar damage can also arise during DNA base excision repair, recombination, and other DNA transactions such as those controlled by eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases (2Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C.

Gap filling and ligation by these enzymes can only occur if 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate termini are available at the boundaries of the damaged site. However, DNA strand breaks often bear unconventional end groups such as 3′-phosphate or 3′-phosphoglycolate as well as 5′-hydroxyl terminal moieties that must be removed or phosphorylated prior to reparative polymerization and/or ligation (1Friedberg E.C.

Unlike the homologous mammalian enzymes, yeast cystathionine β-synthase lacks a second cofactor, heme, which facilitates detailed kinetic studies of the enzyme because the different pyridoxal phosphate-bound intermediates can be followed by their characteristic absorption spectra. We conducted a rapid reaction kinetic analysis of the full-length yeast enzyme in the forward and reverse directions. In the forward direction, we observed formation of the external aldimine of serine (14 mm−1 s−1) and the aminoacrylate intermediate (15 s−1). Homocysteine binds to the aminoacrylate with a bimolecular rate constant of 35 mm−1 s−1 and rapidly converts to cystathionine (180 s−1), leading to the accumulation of a 420 nm absorbing species, which has been assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine. Release of cystathionine is slow (k = 2.3 s−1), which is similar tok cat (1.7 s−1) at 15 °C, consistent with this being a rate-determining step. In the reverse direction, cystathionine binds to the enzyme with a bimolecular rate constant of 1.5 mm−1 s−1 and is rapidly converted to the aminoacrylate without accumulation of the external aldimine. The kinetic behavior of the full-length enzyme shows notable differences from that reported for a truncated form of the enzyme lacking the C-terminal third of the protein (Jhee, K.

In addition, it plays a key role in regulating the intracellular concentrations of homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid that is correlated with a number of diseases at elevated levels including neural tube defects, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's disease (1Refsum H.

Mutations in cystathionine β-synthase are the single most common cause of severe hyperhomocysteinemia, and approximately half of the patients are pyridoxine-responsive, i.e. they benefit from treatment with high doses of the vitamin B6 precursor, pyridoxine (4Mudd S.H.

Thus far, >90 different mutations have been described in the cystathionine β-synthase gene in homocystinuric patients, with the vast majority being missense and private mutations (5Kraus J.P.

Cystathionine β-synthase catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine in a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)1-dependent reaction. Cystathionine is subsequently cleaved in the trans-sulfuration pathway by another PLP-dependent enzyme, γ-cystathionase, to give cysteine and α-ketoglutarate. Cystathionine β-synthases from Trypanosoma cruzi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and humans have highly homologous sequences. All are predicted to belong to the β or Fold II family of PLP-dependent enzymes (6Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J.

This similarity is borne out in the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic PLP-containing core of the enzyme, which has been reported recently (8Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and resembles those of related PLP enzymes, viz. O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (9Burkhard P. Rao G.S.

A major difference between the lower and higher eukaryotic cystathionine β-synthases that have been characterized so far is the presence of a second cofactor, iron protoporphyrin IX (11Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the mammalian enzymes, which has unusual spectroscopic properties (12Taoka S. Green E.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10542-10547Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding site for the heme is located in a 66-amino acid-long N-terminal extension that is missing in the yeast enzyme (8Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16Ojha S., Wu, J. LoBrutto R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4649-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The heme is distant from the PLP, which is bound in the active site, and appears to play a regulatory role. In addition, S-adenosylmethionine serves as an allosteric effector of the mammalian but not the yeast enzyme, and binds to the C-terminal region of the protein (17Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Martin J.J. Pick A.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The full-length yeast and human enzymes appear to exist in multiple oligomeric states as suggested by their broad elution profiles on gel filtration columns and their range from tetramer to octamer (13Taoka S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A hypersensitive proteolysis site results in the facile generation of a truncated species, the catalytic core, which exists as a dimer (18Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,19Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The dimeric human and yeast forms display high levels of enzyme activity and differences in their steady-state kinetic propertiesversus the corresponding full-length enzymes. A pre-steady-state kinetic characterization of the truncated form of the yeast enzyme has been reported recently (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The truncated human enzyme retains its heme but loses sensitivity to regulation byS-adenosylmethionine (19Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase superficially resembles those catalyzed by other PLP-dependent β-replacement enzymes such as tryptophan synthase and O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase, mechanistic and kinetic studies with potential suicide inactivators on the rat enzyme, reported by Borcsok and Abeles (21Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), have suggested some notable differences (21Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In general, rapid reaction kinetic analyses of PLP-dependent enzymes provide a rich source of information on the identity of catalytic intermediates. However, the presence of heme in the human enzyme dwarfs the spectroscopic signatures associated with the PLP species and renders these measurements difficult. As a first step toward identifying the intermediates in the reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase, we used rapid reaction kinetics to characterize the full-length tetrameric form of the yeast enzyme as both a model and a guide for future studies on the human enzyme. We report a number of significant differences in the kinetics of the full-length yeast enzyme compared with that of the truncated form, engineered by deletion of C-terminal residues 354–507, which was reported recently (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Serine, d,l-homocysteine, and l-cystathionine were purchased from Sigma. The concentration of homocysteine was determined spectrophotometrically using Ellman's reagent (22Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Full-length yeast cystathionine β-synthase was purified as described previously using a recombinant expression vector, pSEC (23Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11541-11544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. Edith Miles (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The activity of the enzyme and the steady-state kinetic parameters were measured in the radioactive assay as described previously (13Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of preincubation with either serine or homocysteine, the enzyme was mixed with the first substrate for 5 min at 37 °C before being exposed to the second substrate, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. For determination of substrateKm values, the concentration of the second substrate was fixed at 30 mm, whereas that of the first was varied. Stopped flow experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics spectrophotometer (SX.MV18) equipped with a photodiode array detector. The temperature of the mixing chamber was maintained at 15 ± 1 °C and was controlled by a circulating water bath. A solution containing yeast cystathionine β-synthase (18 μm) in 0.2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, was mixed with varying concentrations of substrate in the same buffer, as indicated in the figure legends. When the reaction of preformed aminoacrylate with homocysteine was monitored, 18 μm enzyme was premixed with 30 mm serine in 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0, and mixed rapidly with varying concentrations of homocysteine. Because of the limited solubility of cystathionine, a stock solution (0.5 m) was made in 0.8n NaOH, and aliquots of this solution were diluted to give the desired concentration in 0.2 m Tris buffer, pH 8. The concentrations of enzyme and substrate refer to those before mixing; both solutions were diluted 2-fold after mixing. The reactions were followed with a photo-diode array detector. Typically, time-dependent spectra were analyzed by the single value decomposition algorithm which is an integral feature of Pro-K program (Global Analysis for Spectra, Kinetic Data, version 4.20) supplied by Applied Photophysics. A set of output matrices comprising ordered sets of basis spectra and time-dependent amplitudes was obtained together with corresponding weighting factors known as singular values. The number of significant singular values is a model-free indication of the number of independent components present in the original data set. A kinetic model was built based on the number of independent spectra predicted by this method. The reported rate constants are the average of at least two different rapid mixing experiments. The spectra (recorded between 300 and 600 nm and between 1.3 and 500 ms), each containing 57,200 data points, were fit to Equation 1,OD=C·e−k·tEquation 1 where C is the amplitude, k is the rate constant, and OD, the optical density, is the sum of the absorbance of the individual species (λi) contributing to a given spectrum, each of which is described by Equation 2.OD(λi)=C(λi)·e−k(λi)·tEquation 2 The kinetic parameters, V maxand K m , for the yeast cystathionine β-synthase under steady-state conditions are presented in TableI and are comparable with those reported previously (18Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unlike the human enzyme, the activity of the yeast enzyme is unaffected by whether it is preincubated with serine or homocysteine. The yeast cystathionine β-synthase displays a bell-shaped dependence on pH with an optimum at 8.1 and inflection points corresponding to pK a values of 7.7 ± 0.1 and 8.8 ± 0.1, respectively (data not shown).Table ISummary of steady-state kinetic parameters for full-length yeast cystathionine β-synthase determined under serine or homocysteine preincubation conditionsParameterPreincubation conditionHomocysteineSerine V max (μmol mg−1 h−1)1080 ± 40948 ± 9 k cat1-aThis was calculated per mole of active site with a molecular mass of 56 kDa.(s−1) at 37 °C16.8 ± 0.614.7 ± 0.1 K m , Hcy (mm)2.3 ± 1.11.2 ± 0.2 K m , Ser(mm)3.5 ± 0.64.9 ± 2.21-a This was calculated per mole of active site with a molecular mass of 56 kDa. Open table in a new tab Absorbance changes resulting from rapid mixing of cystathionine β-synthase with serine are shown in Fig. 1 A. Global analysis of the spectrum (Fig. 1 B) indicated the presence of three species assigned as the internal aldimine (λmax = 412 nm), the external aldimine (λmax = 416 nm), and the aminoacrylate (λmax = 460 nm). There was no evidence for a gem-diamine (with a λmax = 320 nm) at high serine concentrations or for a tautomeric form of the aminoacrylate (with a λmax≈ 320 nm) at low serine concentration as reported for the truncated yeast cystathionine β-synthase (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Formation of the external aldimine was linearly dependent on the concentration of serine (Fig.1 C) and yielded a bimolecular rate constant of 14 mm−1 s−1 and aK d for serine of 1.5 ± 0.3 mm. Formation of the aminoacrylate showed saturation dependence on the concentration of serine and a maximal rate constant of 15 ± 0.4 s−1. For comparison, the k cat for yeast cystathionine β-synthase at 15 °C is 1.7 s−1calculated per mole of monomer of 56 kDa molecular mass. Kinetics of the second half reaction, i.e. addition of homocysteine to the aminoacrylate intermediate to form cystathionine, was followed by preincubating 18 μm enzyme with 30 mm serine to preform the aminoacrylate, which was then rapidly mixed with varying concentrations (0–60 μm) ofd,l-homocysteine. At low concentrations of homocysteine, a decrease in the absorbance of the aminoacrylate intermediate is observed at 460 nm with a concomitant blue shift in the spectrum (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the disappearance of the preformed aminoacrylate with the truncated yeast cystathionine β-synthase was reported to be too fast to measure even at low homocysteine concentration (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, at high concentrations of homocysteine, the decay of the aminoacrylate is completely missed (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the reaction is rapid and largely over within the dead time of the instrument (2.2 ms). Instead, a rapid decrease at 420 nm, with ak obsd of 180 ± 5 s−1, is observed followed by a slow increase in absorption at the same wavelength with a rate constant of 0.7 s−1 (Fig.2 C). The species at 420 nm is tentatively assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine, and its rate of formation is identical to the rate of disappearance of the 460 nm aminoacrylate at low concentrations of homocysteine (Fig. 2 D). The nature of the change leading to an increase in the extinction coefficient of the 420 nm-absorbing species at a rate of 0.7 s−1 is not understood, and it is too slow to be catalytically relevant. The dependence of the rate of disappearance of the aminoacrylate on the concentration of homocysteine yields a bimolecular rate constant of 35 ± 0.6 mm−1 s−1 and aK d for homocysteine of 0.68 ± 0.03 mm (Fig. 2 D). Rapid mixing of enzyme with cystathionine resulted in conversion of the external aldimine (λmax = 412 nm) to the aminoacrylate with a λmax of 460 nm (Fig.3 A). A clean isosbestic point is observed at 426 nm, indicating that an intermediate such as the external aldimine of cystathionine does not accumulate to detectable levels. Hence, the complexes between enzyme and cystathionine formed in the forward and reverse directions appear to be different. When equimolar serine and homocysteine are mixed with enzyme, the spectrum of the enzyme (λmax = 420 nm) is consistent with the presence of the external aldimine of cystathionine (Fig.2 B), for which release is slow and presumably limits the overall reaction. In contrast, when the enzyme is mixed with cystathionine, the external aldimine is not detected, and the aminoacrylate form accumulates (Fig. 3 A). The dependence of the rate of aminoacrylate formation on the concentration of cystathionine yields a bimolecular rate constant of 1.5 ± 0.1 mm−1 s−1 and aK d for cystathionine of 1.6 ± 0.3 mm (Fig. 3 B). The limited solubility of cystathionine precluded measurements at concentrations above 15 mm. Differences in the spectroscopic signatures associated with the bound intermediates in PLP-dependent enzymes provide a convenient means for analyzing the kinetics of their formation and decay. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the yeast cystathionine β-synthase indicates that it catalyzes a ping-pong reaction in which serine binds to generate an enzyme-bound aminoacrylate intermediate that reacts with homocysteine to give cystathionine (18Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we report a pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the reaction catalyzed by the full-length yeast cystathionine β-synthase and note several differences between the behavior of this enzymeversus that of a truncated form that was reported earlier (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The C-terminal amino acids from positions 354 to 507 were deleted in the truncated form, which resulted in a change in the oligomerization state from octameric to dimeric and an increase in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (18Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar changes accompany deletion of the C-terminal 143 amino acids in the human enzyme (19Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The binary reaction of serine with enzyme to form the aminoacrylate proceeds via a detectable intermediate, the external aldimine (SchemeFSI). The observed rates of formation of the external aldimine and the aminoacrylate show a linear and hyperbolic dependence respectively on serine concentration (Fig.1 C). The K d for serine obtained from this analysis is 1.5 ± 0.3 mm, which is slightly lower than that reported for the truncated enzyme (4.6 ± 0.8 mm). The rate of aminoacrylate formation is 14 ± 0.5 s−1, which is 8-fold greater thank cat but slower than the rate of aminoacrylate formation in the reverse direction from cystathionine (SchemeFSII). Formation of the aminoacrylate in the forward direction involves elimination of a poor leaving group (OH−) from the substrate, and would require enzyme assisted protonation (Scheme FSI). In contrast, formation of the aminoacrylate from cystathionine in the reverse reaction involves elimination of a better leaving group (thiolate) and may explain the difference in the rates (Scheme FSII).Figure FSIIMinimal kinetic scheme for reaction catalyzed by yeast cystathionine β-synthase in the forward and reverse directions. The values shown inparentheses in A are taken from B, where the reaction was followed in the reverse direction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the truncated enzyme, the external aldimine of serine was not observed, and the k obsd reported for aminoacrylate formation (177 s−1) is comparable with the rate we observe for the disappearance of the internal aldimine at high serine concentration (∼200 s−1, Fig. 1 C). The observation of the external aldimine intermediate with the full-length enzyme allows deconvolution of the k obsd into bi- and unimolecular rate constants as shown in Fig. 1 C. The second-half reaction, i.e. conversion of the aminoacrylate to cystathionine, can be monitored by mixing preformed aminoacrylate with homocysteine. The disappearance of the aminoacrylate can be monitored at low but not high concentrations of homocysteine, where the reaction is over in the dead time of the instrument. The product of this reaction has an absorption maximum at 420 nm and is assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine. The rate constant for the decrease in absorbance at 420 nm (180 ± 5 s−1) parallels the rate constant for the disappearance of the aminoacrylate at low homocysteine concentrations where the rate can be measured (Fig. 2 D). The initial decrease (rather than increase) in absorbance at this wavelength may be due to the difference in the extinction coefficients of the aminoacrylate and the external aldimine at 420 nm. This is followed by a slow (0.7 s−1) and a low amplitude increase in absorption at the same wavelength, the basis of which is not known. This increase could result from a conformational change in the protein that leads to a change in the extinction coefficient of the external aldimine. The reaction of cystathionine and enzyme to form an aminoacrylate species shows monophasic kinetics, and formation of an external aldimine intermediate is not observed (Fig.3 A). The observed rate constant for aminoacrylate formation in the reverse direction shows a hyperbolic dependence on cystathionine concentration and yields a K d of 1.6 ± 0.3 mm, which is lower than the K d reported for the truncated enzyme (7.45 ± 0.8 mm) (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As noted previously, this enzyme exhibits substrate inhibition with homocysteine, and the reaction of cystathionine with enzyme is not a simple reversal of the forward reaction, i.e. the reaction of preformed aminoacrylate with homocysteine (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The accumulation of the 420 nm species in the forward direction assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine (Fig. 2 B) indicates that product release is rate-limiting, a conclusion that was also reached with the truncated enzyme (20Jhee K.H. Niks D. McPhie P. Dunn M.F. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10873-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on the kinetics of the reverse reaction, the rate of cystathionine release from the enzyme is 2.3 s−1, which is similar tok cat (1.7 s−1) and is consistent with this being a rate-determining step (Scheme FSII). In summary, notable differences are observed in the pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of intermediates in the reactions catalyzed by full-length and truncated yeast cystathionine β-synthase. A gem-diamine intermediate is seen in the presence of serine with the truncated but not full-length enzyme, whereas the external aldimine of serine is observed with full-length but not truncated enzyme. Similarly, a 320 nm absorbance assigned as the gem-diamine of cystathionine is observed when the aminoacrylate is mixed with homocysteine in the truncated but not the full-length enzyme. Quinonoid intermediates are not seen with either enzyme form, which is similar to the reaction catalyzed by the closely related PLP-dependent enzyme, O-acetyl serine sulfhydralase (24Tai C.-H. Cook P.F. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This has been rationalized by Cook and co-workers (9Burkhard P. Rao G.S. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) to result from the mismatch in the pK a values of the N1 of PLP and Ser-272, making protonation of N1 unlikely and thereby disfavoring quinonoid formation. A homologous serine is conserved in both yeast and human cystathionine β-synthase (25Kabil Ö. Taoka S. LoBrutto R. Shoemaker R. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19350-19355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The studies with the full-length yeast enzyme should be useful in elucidating the kinetic mechanism of the human enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1963932041,"In vitroplatelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) binding of the human von Willebrand factor (VWF) increases markedly by exogenous modulators such as ristocetin or botrocetin, and the binding does not occur in normal circulation. GPIb binding sites have been assigned in the VWF A1 domain, which consists of a disulfide loop Cys1272(509)–Cys1458(695) where amino acid residues are numbered from the starting methionine as +1. The previous numbering from the N-terminal Ser of the mature processed VWF is indicated in parentheses. In contrast, several gain-of-function mutations have been found in two regions comprised of the disulfide loop and its N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In this study, Cys1222(459)–Tyr1271(508), Gln1238(475)–Tyr1271(508), Glu1260(497)–Tyr1271(508), and Asp1459(696)–Asp1472(709) were sequentially deleted of full-length multimeric recombinant VWF. Deletions at either side resulted in normal GPIb binding, indicating that the flanking regions are not GPIb binding sites. However, the addition of a mutation at Arg1308(545) on each deletion mutant resulted in spontaneous GPIb binding without requiring modulators, suggesting that both regions are important for the inhibition of GPIb binding. Spontaneous binding was completely inhibited by monoclonal antibodies that recognize the GPIb binding sites. Interestingly, mutant proteins with N-terminal but not C-terminal deletions lost binding to monoclonal antibodies B328, B710, and 23C7, which selectively inhibit ristocetin-induced GPI binding. Their epitopes were found at His1268(505) or Asp1269(506). The crystallographic structure of the A1 domain suggests that GPIb binding is influenced by the molecular interface between the two regions and that the antibody binding to the interface inhibits binding."

The human ASGP-R is a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of H1 and H2 subunits. There are three naturally occurring H2 splice variants, designated H2a, H2b, and H2c, although the expression of the H2c protein had not been reported. Following deglycosylation of purified ASGP-R, we detected the H2b and H2c proteins in HepG2 and HuH-7 hepatoma cells, using an antibody directed against a COOH-terminal peptide common to all H2 isoforms (anti-H2-COOH) and another antibody against a 19-amino acid cytoplasmic insert found only in H2b (anti-H2-Cyto19). H1 and both H2b and H2c were co-purified by affinity chromatography, using asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR)-, anti-H1-, or anti-H2-COOH-Sepharose, whereas only H1 and H2b were immunoprecipitated with anti-H2-Cyto19. These results indicate that H2b and H2c are not present in the same ASGP-R complexes with H1. Similar to the H2b isoform, H2c was also palmitoylated, indicating that the 19-residue cytoplasmic insert does not regulate palmitoylation. Stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cell lines expressing ASGP-R complexes containing H1 and either H2b or H2c had similar binding affinities for ASOR and endocytosed and degraded ASOR at similar rates. The pH dissociation profiles of ASOR·ASGP-R complexes were also identical for complexes containing either H2b or H2c. We conclude that the H2b and H2c isoforms are both functional but are not present with H1 in the same hetero-oligomeric ASGP-R complexes.

The human ASGP-R is a hetero-oligomer composed of a major subunit (H1) and a minor subunit (H2) that are encoded by two different genes. The two subunits are glycoproteins that are highly homologous to each other, with the exception that an 18-aa cytoplasmic insert is found only in the 50-kDa H2 but not in the 46-kDa H1 (7Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The 42-kDa rat homologue of the major subunit H1 is designated RHL1 (8Holland E.C. Leung J.O. Drickamer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7338-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar to the minor subunit H2, the rat homologue of H2 is encoded by a single gene. However, two distinct proteins of ∼50 and 60 kDa can be separated by SDS-PAGE due to differences in glycosylation, and they are, therefore, designated as RHL2 and RHL3, respectively (9Halberg D.F. Wager R.E. Farrell D.C. Hildreth J. Quesenberry M.S. Loeb J.A. Holland E.C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9828-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse ASGP-R is also composed of a major subunit, MHL-1 (10Takezawa R. Shinzawa K. Watanabe Y. Akaike T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and a minor subunit, MHL2 (11Sanford J.P. Doyle D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In all species examined, each ASGP-R subunit contains a short 40- to 60-aa NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, an ∼80-aa extracellular stalk region, and a ∼130-aa carbohydrate recognition domain that is capable of recognizing a terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue found on the carbohydrate chains of naturally occurring desialylated glycoproteins or neoglycoproteins (12Lee Y.C. Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 145: 80-93PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6320-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Lee R.T. Lin P. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4255-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). High affinity ligand binding by the human ASGP-R, with K d values in the nanomolar range, requires the formation of hetero-oligomeric ASGP-R complexes that are composed of both H1 and H2 subunits (15Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as well as ligands containing carbohydrate chains with two or more branches (12Lee Y.C. Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 145: 80-93PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs of three naturally occurring H2 splice variants, designated H2a, H2b, and H2c (see Fig. 1), have been isolated from human liver and HepG2 hepatoma cells (7Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Relative to H2c, the H2a cDNA contains a 57-nt cytoplasmic insert and a 15-nt insert near the junction between the transmembrane domain and the ectodomain (7Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). H2a is not part of native ASGP-R complexes, because the 5-aa sequence, encoded by the 15-nt insert, serves as a cleavage signal that results in proteolysis and the secretion of the entire H2a ectodomain (17Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). H2b lacks the 5-aa insert and is, therefore, not proteolytically cleaved, but it oligomerizes with H1 to form native human ASGP-Rs. H2c (originally designated l-H2) lacks both the 19-aa and 5-aa inserts (16Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and its function remains unknown. Although the native H2c protein was successfully expressed in transfected tissue culture cells (18Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11078-11084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its expression in human liver or hepatoma cell lines and its role in ASGP-R function has not been determined. In this study we confirmed the natural expression of the H2c splice variant protein and verified that H2c is part of native hetero-oligomeric ASGP-R complexes in HepG2 and HuH-7 hepatoma cell lines. We also studied the effect of deleting the 19-aa cytoplasmic insertion on the palmitoylation of H2c, the ligand-binding affinity of ASGP-R complexes containing H2c, as well as continuous uptake and degradation of ligand mediated by these ASGP-Rs. A preliminary report of these results has been presented (19Yik J.H.N. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 919Google Scholar).

Digitonin was from Acros Organics. All chemicals for electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad laboratories. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The oligonucleotides used as RT-PCR primers for the analysis of mRNA encoding H2 isoforms were: 5′-CCCCAGCCCTCAGAGCAAC (H2F) and 5′-GAGCCGTTGCTGTGGAGGAG (H2R), whose 5′-ends correspond to nucleotide positions −71 and 499 in the H2b cDNA sequence, respectively. Primers used for the analogous rat subunit RHL2/3 were: 5′-GTCTCCAGCCTAGGGCCCATC (RHL2F) and 5′-GCCGTTGCTCAGGAAGAAC (RHL2R), whose 5′-ends correspond to nucleotide positions −20 and 497 in the RHL2/3 cDNA sequence, respectively. All oligonucleotides were custom made by Midland Certified Reagent Co. H2c cDNA, inserted into the pVcos plasmid, was generously provided by Dr. Elizabeth Paietta (Montefiore and Albert Einstein Cancer Center, New York) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/zeo (Invitrogen) at theEcoRI site. The plasmid pGEM containing H1 cDNA and the plasmid Bluescript pKS containing H2b cDNA were a kind gift from Dr. Martin Spiess (University of Basel, Switzerland). H1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/neo (Invitrogen) or pIRES/neo (CLONTECH) using HindIII andEcoRI sites, whereas H2b cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/zeo using BamHI and EcoRI sites. HepG2, HuH-7, COS-7, and SK-Hep-1 cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Trf1, a trafficking mutant cell line, which was derived from HuH-7 cells (22Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P.

All established cell lines were maintained in complete medium containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Polyclonal rabbit anti-H1 antibody (anti-H1-COOH) against the peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequence CETELDKASQEPPLL was custom generated by Alpha Diagnostics, Inc. Polyclonal rabbit anti-H2 antibody (anti-H2-COOH) against the peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequence CEKRRNATGEVA was custom made by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. Polyclonal goat anti-H2 antibody (anti-H2-Cyto19) against the peptide corresponding to the H2b-specific cytoplasmic sequence EGPGTRRLNPRRGNPFLKG was made by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. All antibodies used in this study were affinity-purified from the serum using Sepharose beads conjugated to the respective peptide used for immunization. The preimmune sera from the animals used to generate the three subunit-specific antibodies did not react in Western analyses with ASGP-Rs isolated from HepG2 cells. Anti-H1-, anti-H2-COOH, and anti-H2-Cyto19 specifically recognized the respective H1 or H2 subunits but did not cross-react with the other subunits, as determined by Western analyses using H1, H2b, and H2c proteins isolated from individually transfected COS-7 cells. Total RNA was isolated from HuH-7 human hepatoma cells or hepatocytes obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, ∼100 mg of HuH-7 cells or rat hepatocytes were lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent at ∼22 °C for 5 min. The rest of the procedure was performed on ice. Chloroform (200 μl) was added to the cell lysates, and the samples were mixed by vortexing. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the aqueous phase was then transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol. After a 10-min incubation, the precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was resuspended and washed in 1 ml of 75% ethanol and then pelleted. The pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 300 μl of water. Partial cDNAs of H2 and RHL2/3 were synthesized from the corresponding total RNAs using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gene-specific primers H2R and RHL2R were used in a single round of reverse transcriptase reactions for the synthesis of H2 and RHL2/3 cDNAs, respectively. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR observing standard protocols using gene-specific primer pairs H2F and H2R for H2 cDNA, or RHL2F and RHL2R for RHL2/3 cDNA. The PCR products were resolved in a 3.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. All transfections were performed using a Calcium Phosphate Transfection Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)/neo plasmid containing H1 cDNA and 5 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)/zeo containing either H2b or H2c cDNAs were co-transfected into ∼60–70% confluent COS-7 cells grown in 60-mm dishes. Transfected COS-7 cells were washed ∼16 h later with PBS and cultured in complete medium for ∼24 h before being harvested. The generation of SK-Hep-1 cell lines stably expressing ASGP-Rs containing H1 and H2b will be described elsewhere. 2A. Saxena, J. H. N. Yik, J. A. Weigel, and P. H. Weigel, manuscript in preparation. For the generation of stable cell lines co-expressing H1 and H2c, pcDNA3.1(+)/zeo containing H2c cDNA was transfected into SK-Hep-1 cells that had been previously transfected with pIRES/neo plasmid containing H1 cDNA and selected with 400 μg/ml G418. Stable doubly transfected cell lines were selected, cloned, and maintained in complete medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech) and 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Hetero-oligomeric ASGP-R complexes containing H1, H2b, and/or H2c from HepG2, HuH-7, Trf1, and transfected COS-7 cells were purified by ASOR-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (21Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from 60-mm dishes were solubilized on ice in buffer 1 containing 1.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin-A). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fluids were transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing an equal volume of 2 mg/ml BSA in buffer 1 and 20 μl of packed ASOR-Sepharose 4B. After incubation for at least 1 h at 4 °C, the ASOR-Sepharose beads were washed three times with 0.05% Triton X-100 in buffer 1, and the isolated ASGP-Rs were eluted with buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm acetic acid, pH 5, and 10 mm EGTA. For immunoprecipitation of ASGP-Rs, cells were solubilized as described above and the supernatant from the cell lysate was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing an equal volume of 2 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm EGTA in buffer 1, and 1 μg of affinity-purified anti-H1 or anti-H2 IgG. After 30 min on ice, 20 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose was added, followed by an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The samples were washed once with 0.05% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl in buffer 1 and then twice with 0.05% Triton X-100 in buffer 1. The isolated ASGP-Rs were then eluted with 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.5. The eluted samples containing ASGP-Rs isolated by ASOR- or antibody-Sepharose affinity chromatography were neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The samples were then denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, in the presence of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v), 0.2 unit ofN-glycosidase F (catalog #1365177, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Deglycosylated ASGP-R subunits were reduced by boiling the samples in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min and then alkylated by incubating with 50 mmiodoacetamide at ∼22 °C for 30 min. Samples were mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel, followed by electro-transfer to nitrocellulose paper. H2 isoforms were detected by Western blotting using anti-H2-Cyto19 or anti-H2-COOH. At 40 h post-transfection, COS-7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding H2b or H2c were serum-starved for 1 h and then metabolically labeled with 400 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid at 37 °C for 4 h in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml delipidated BSA. Cells were washed with buffer 1, then solubilized, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-H2-COOH antibodies and protein A-Sepharose as described above. The eluted samples were neutralized with 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, mixed with 4× Laemmli buffer, and heated at 55 °C for 5 min, and the proteins were resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography of the dried gel as described previously (21Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SK-Hep-1 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding H1 and either H2b or H2c were grown to confluency in 6-well plates and serum-starved for 30–60 min. Cells were then incubated on ice with 10 ng/ml125I-ASOR (∼330 cpm/fmol) and 0.055% (w/v) digitonin in Hanks' balanced salt solution, in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ASOR ranging from 0 to 5 μg/ml. After 1-h incubation, the binding medium was removed and saved. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and then lysed with 0.3 m NaOH. The radioactivity recovered in the binding medium (free 125I-ASOR) as well as that associated with the lysed cells (bound 125I-ASOR) was measured using a Packard COBRA II gamma counter. Protein content in the cell lysates was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. The ratio of bound to free 125I-ASOR was plotted against the amount of specifically bound ASOR according to the method of Scatchard (25Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 600-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot 6.0 software. The dissociation constant (K d ) for ASOR binding was determined by calculating the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line, which was generated by linear regression analysis. SK-Hep-1 cells expressing either H1·H2b or H1·H2c complexes were incubated with 1.5 μg/ml 125I-ASOR for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were chilled rapidly on ice, and unbound ligand was removed by washing three times with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. The rest of the procedure was performed on ice. Cells were permeabilized with 0.055% (w/v) digitonin in buffer 1 for 15 min. Cells were washed again and then subjected to two 20-min incubations in buffers with different pH values, ranging from pH 5.0 to 7.4 (HEPES was used as the buffer for pH below 6.3 and buffer 1 for pH above 6.3). The cells were washed once with buffer 1. The radioactivity that remained associated with the cells was then determined as described above. The amount of radioactivity recovered from the pH 7.4 wash was set as 100%. SK-Hep-1 cells expressing ASGP-Rs were grown in 24-well plates to confluency, serum-starved for 30–60 min, and then incubated with DMEM containing 1.5 μg/ml125I-ASOR at 37 °C. At the desired time point, the cells were chilled on ice and the medium was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 10% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid in 2 m HCl, incubated on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged to pellet the precipitates. Acid-soluble radioactivity in the supernatant was then measured. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed in 0.3 m NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was then determined. Nonspecific uptake and degradation were determined by incubating cells with125I-ASOR in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ASOR. The cDNAs of three H2 splice variants, H2a, H2b, and H2c (Fig. 1 A), have been isolated from human liver or HepG2 cells (7Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the expression of the H2c protein in human hepatocytes or hepatoma cell lines had not been reported. We, therefore, sought to confirm the natural expression of the H2c protein in hepatoma cells and assess the role of H2c in ASGP-R function. First, we verified the existence of both H2b and H2c transcripts in another human hepatoma cell line HuH-7, which also expresses native ASGP-Rs (26Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1841-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partial cDNAs derived from H2 transcripts were generated from HuH-7 total RNA by reverse transcriptase reaction using gene-specific primer H2R. The H2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR using primers H2F and H2R, flanking the 57-nt insert at nucleotide positions −71 and 499, respectively, in the H2b sequence (Fig.1 A). Because there is a difference of only 57 base pairs between H2b and H2c transcripts, the positions at which the above primers hybridize were designed to generate relatively small PCR fragments, thus allowing separation of the two predicted PCR products from the H2b (570-bp) and H2c (513-bp) transcripts. As shown in Fig.2 A, two PCR fragments were generated (indicated by arrows) with molecular sizes matching that of the predicted PCR products. The two DNA bands were then excised from the gel and sequenced, which verified that the two bands were indeed derived from H2b and H2c transcripts (not shown). The two ASGP-R subunits are highly homologous among all mammalian species, which prompted us to examine if splicing events similar to those observed in H2 also occur in the rat homologue RHL2/3 (9Halberg D.F. Wager R.E. Farrell D.C. Hildreth J. Quesenberry M.S. Loeb J.A. Holland E.C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9828-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partial RHL2/3 cDNAs were generated from rat hepatocyte total RNA using primer RHL2R. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR using primer pairs RHL2F and RHL2R, which hybridize to the rat sequence at analogous positions to those of the H2 primers H2F and H2R. Unlike the alternatively spliced H2 transcripts, only a single RHL2/3 transcript was detected in the region flanking the analogous 57-nt insertion (Fig.2 B), indicating that no rat transcripts were present that lack this domain. Inspection of the sequences bordering the 57-nt region in cDNAs encoding RHL2/3 and the mouse homologue MHL2 (Fig.1 B) did not reveal the typical AG/GT 5′-consensus splice donor and acceptor sites (27Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar) that are present at both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the H2b sequences bordering the 57-nt insertion (16Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, alternative splicing of the 57-nt cytoplasmic insert may be unique to the human H2 species. The H2 open reading frame contains three consensusN-glycosylation sites (7Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and the heterogeneity of the carbohydrate chains causes the fully glycosylated H2 proteins to migrate as a broad and diffuse band at ∼50 kDa in SDS-PAGE (28Baenziger J.U. Maynard Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4607-4613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adding to the complexity of this band pattern is the similarity of the predicted molecular masses of the H2b (34.6 kDa) and H2c (32.5 kDa) polypeptides. As a result, these two H2 species are not readily resolvable by electrophoresis and thus cannot be correctly identified. ASGP-Rs were isolated from HepG2 cells by ASOR-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and the H2 subunits were detected by Western analysis using anti-H2-COOH antibody. The native glycosylated form of H2 can only be detected as a broad and diffuse band, as expected (Fig.3, lane 1). However, following deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F, the H2 proteins separated into two distinct bands, which migrated at positions similar to the predicted molecular weights of H2b and H2c (Fig. 3, lane 2). These two H2-specific bands also migrated at positions identical to those of the corresponding H2b and H2c proteins isolated from individually transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 3and 4). Expression of H2b and H2c Proteins in Various Hepatoma Cell Lines—To determine if the two H2-specific bands detected in HepG2 cells are indeed derived from the H2b and H2c proteins, two different anti-H2 antibodies were used in a parallel Western analysis of deglycosylated ASGP-Rs. The anti-H2-Cyto19 IgG, which is directed against the 19-aa cytoplasmic insert, only recognizes H2b. On the other hand, the anti-H2-COOH IgG recognizes both H2b and H2c, because it is generated against a COOH-terminal peptide epitope that is common to all H2 isoforms (see Fig. 1). Western blotting with anti-H2-Cyto19 IgG detected only one H2-specific protein in ASGP-Rs isolated from HepG2, Trf1 and HuH-7 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4, top row). However, in the parallel Western blot, two H2-specific bands were detected with anti-H2-COOH IgG (lanes 2–4, bottom row). These results indicate that both theupper (larger) and lower(smaller) H2-specific bands detected with anti-H2-COOH IgG contain the COOH-terminal peptide epitope of H2 as expected but that only the upper band contains the 19-aa cytoplasmic peptide found exclusively in H2b. These data above strongly indicate that the upper andlower bands correspond to the deglycosylated H2b and H2c proteins, respectively. Because an antibody specific for H2c alone is not available, we cannot directly prove that the lower H2-specific band detected by the anti-H2-COOH antibody is the H2c protein. However, in the control experiment, both anti-H2 IgGs detected a single H2b band in COS-7 cells expressing the H2b protein (Fig. 4, lane 1), whereas in the parallel Western blot, H2c protein expressed by transfected COS-7 cells was only detected with the anti-H2-COOH IgG (Fig. 4, lane 5). Furthermore, the upper andlower H2-specific bands detected in various hepatoma cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4) migrated at positions corresponding identically to those of the deglycosylated H2b and H2c proteins isolated from individually transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 5). We conclude from the above results that H2b and H2c proteins are naturally co-expressed in HepG2, Trf1, and HuH-7 hepatoma cell lines and that both the H2b and H2c splice variants are present in the human ASGP-R preparations isolated by ligand affinity chromatography. Because ASGP-R is a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of H1 and H2 subunits, we next examined whether H2b and H2c co-exist with H1 in the same ASGP-R complexes or whether they oligomerize with H1 in different ASGP-R complexes. ASGP-Rs from HepG2 cells were either immunoprecipitated using anti-H1-COOH (Fig.5 A, lane 1), anti-H2-COOH (lane 2), or anti-H2-Cyto19 ("

https://openalex.org/W2051363313,"Alveolar macrophages and newly recruited monocytes are targets of infection by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Therefore, we examined the expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), which plays an important role in host defense against <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Infection induced IRF-1 in both. IRF-1 from undifferentiated, uninfected monocytic cell lines was modified during extraction to produce specific species that were apparently smaller than intact IRF-1. After infection by <i>M. tuberculosis</i> or differentiation, intact IRF-1 was recovered. Subcellular fractions were assayed for the ability to modify IRF-1 or inhibit its modification. A serine protease on the cytoplasmic surface of an organelle or vesicle in the ""lysosomal/mitochondrial"" fraction from undifferentiated cells was responsible for the modification of IRF-1. Thus, the simplest explanation of the modification is cleavage of IRF-1 by the serine protease. Recovery of intact IRF-1 correlated with induction of a serine protease inhibitor that was able to significantly reduce the modification of IRF-1. The inhibitor was present in the cytoplasm of<i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infected or -differentiated cells. It is likely that induction of both IRF-1 and the serine protease inhibitor in response to infection by <i>M. tuberculosis</i> represent host defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2042625619,"We previously reported (Chapman-Smith, A., Forbes, B. E., Wallace, J. C., and Cronan, J. E., Jr. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26017–26022) that the biotinylated (holo) species of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) biotinoyl domain is much more resistant to chemical modification and proteolysis than the unbiotinylated (apo) form. We hypothesized that the increased stability was due to a conformational change engendered by interaction of the domain with biotin protein ligase, the enzyme that attaches the biotin moiety. We now report that a BCCP-87 species to which the biotin moiety was attached by chemical acylation rather than by biotin protein ligase showed the characteristically greater stability of the holo biotinoyl domain. This result demonstrates that our hypothesis was incorrect; the attached biotin is solely responsible for the increased stability. The bacterial and chloroplast multisubunit acetyl-CoA carboxylases are unusual in that the highly symmetrical and conserved structure of the biotinoyl domain of the BCCP subunit is disrupted by a structured loop called the “thumb” that protrudes from body of the domain. Prior structural work showed that the thumb interacts with uriedoring of the attached biotin moiety. We have tested whether the thumb-biotin interactions are responsible for the greater holo form stability by examination of two BCCP-87 species that lack the thumb. These BCCP species were produced in both the apo and holo forms, and their sensitivities to trypsin digestion were compared. The holo forms of these proteins were found to be only marginally more stable than their apo forms and much more sensitive to trypsin digestion than the wild type holo-BCCP-87. Therefore, removal of the thumb has an effect similar to lack of biotinylation, indicating that thumb-biotin interactions are responsible for most (but not all) of the increased stability of the holo biotinoyl domain. In the course of these experiments we demonstrated that treatment of Escherichia coli with the peptide deformylase inhibitor, actinonin, results in the expected (but previously unreported) accumulation of anN-formylated protein species. We previously reported (Chapman-Smith, A., Forbes, B. E., Wallace, J. C., and Cronan, J. E., Jr. (1997) J. Biol.

The biotin moiety is covalently attached to a specific lysine residue in the biotin carrier domain of the carboxylase (1Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, 6. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar). In E. coli ACC the biotin carrier function resides on a 156-residue protein, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), of which the C-terminal half comprises the biotin carrier domain (1Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, 6. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar, 2Li S.J. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biotin group is attached post-translationally to a lysine 34 residues from the C terminus by the enzyme biotin ligase, which in E. coli is the multifunctional BirA protein that is also the transcriptional repressor of the biotin biosynthetic operon (3Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The first form of E. coli BCCP isolated was a 9.1-kDa biotin carrier protein active in the carboxylation reaction (4Nervi A.M. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that was subsequently shown to be a stable proteolytic fragment of the intact subunit. A very similar protein was produced by digestion of BCCP with subtilisin Carlsberg (5Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2078-2088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent in vivo experiments showed that both the subtilisin fragment (BCCP-80), and the 9.1-kDa protein (BCCP-82), comprising the C-terminal 80 and 82 residues, respectively, contain all the sequences information necessary for proper folding of the biotinoyl domain and hence for biotinylation (7Cronan J.E., Jr. Reed K.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 440-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Reed K.E. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11425-11428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BCCP-82 was used to obtain the three-dimensional structure of the biotinylated (holo) form of the biotinoyl domain of E. coliBCCP by x-ray crystallography (5Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal 87 residues of BCCP (BCCP-87) was used for multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (9Roberts E.L.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) analyses. The two methods gave very similar structures for the holo domain. (The differing N termini of the proteins studied are of no consequence, since both N termini are highly mobile and thus were not observed. Only the last 77 residues of BCCP are ordered). The protein forms a flattened β-barrel structure with the biotinoyl-lysine exposed on a tight β-turn composed of the conserved Ala-Met-Lys-Met biotinylation motif. The BCCP biotin domain adopts a fold strikingly similar to those of several domains modified by lipoic acid attachment (12Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The structure of the unbiotinylated (apo) form of the BCCP-87 biotinoyl domain determined by NMR (9Roberts E.L. Shu N.

Soden C., Jr. Summers M.F. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15089-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is very similar to that of the holoprotein. Both forms of the protein have the same basic fold, although there are reported differences in the more defined structures. The biotinylated lysine residue of the BCCP biotin domain is at the tip of a protruding hairpin turn (5Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and thus modification of this residue would not be expected to affect the overall structure or dynamics of the protein. However, we previously reported that the holo (biotinylated) form of the domain is 10–20-fold more resistant than the apo form to attack by a variety of proteases and sulfhydryl reagents (13Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that these reagents, almost certainly as a consequence of the irreversible nature of their actions, provide very sensitive indicators of changes in the dynamics of the biotinoyl domain. In this paper we have investigated the mechanism of the surprising stabilization bestowed by biotinylation and show that stabilization is due to biotin attachment per se and that it is the interactions of the attached biotin with a structural element (called the “thumb”) that protrudes from the otherwise symmetrical biotinoyl domain of BCCP that is responsible for most of the stabilization observed. E. coli strain CY1123 (ΔbioC::cml birA1) (14Cronan J.E., Jr. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol.

Strain JS100 was constructed by transduction with phage P1vir grown on strain CAG12184 (15Singer M. Baker T.A. Schnitzler G. Deischel S.M. Goel M. Dove W. Jaacks K.J. Grossman A.D. Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 1-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain β2108 was described previously (16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol.

Antibiotics were added (in mg/liter) at 10, 25, 50, 100, and 100 for tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and sodium ampicillin, respectively. The construction of pCY327, which encodes the 4K-4R BCCP-87 species, was described previously (16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCY328, which encodes the wild type form of BCCP-87, was made by exactly the same manipulations. The thumbless BCCP-87 protein were produced by expression from plasmids pQE-ΔTh-C and pQE-ΔTh-P, which encode shortened versions of the ΔTh-(C) and ΔTh-(P) BCCP species studied previously (17Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37355-37364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pQE-ΔTh plasmids were constructed by digestion of pCY377 or pCY449 (17Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37355-37364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with NcoI and BbuI followed by ligation to pQE60 (Qiagen) digested with the same enzymes. Purification of the various BCCP domains was performed as described previously (16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol.

The production of the different domains was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside or arabinose to final concentrations of 1 mm or 0.5%, respectively.N-Formyl-BCCP-87 was obtained either from strain β2108 as described previously (16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or by adding actinonin (Sigma) to the medium as follows. Strain JS100 carrying pCY327 was grown to anA600 of 0.5–0.6, and the production of N-formyl-BCCP was induced by simultaneously adding arabinose (0.5% final concentration) and actinonin (1 μg/ml final concentration). Following 4 h of induction, the cells were harvested, disrupted by sonication, and the biotin domain protein was purified. The protein species were identified and evaluated for purity by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (13Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C.

For in vitro enzymatic biotinylation the apo domain (50 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with 1.25 nmE. coli biotin ligase (the kind gift of Dr. D. Beckett, University of Maryland) in the presence of 3 mm ATP, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 60 μm biotin, 100 mm KCl, and 5 μmdithiothreitol in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) as described previously (19Chapman-Smith A.

Chemical biotinylation was done essentially as previously described (20Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 138-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A sample (0.1 ml) containing 0.25 μmol of biotinoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma) was added to a solution containing N-formyl apo-BCCP4K-4R (8 mg in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0)). The solution was kept at room temperature for 4 h and then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline with one buffer change. The biotinylation reactions were monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The BCCP-87 species (0.35–0.5 mg/ml) were treated with trypsin (sequencing grade from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a BCCP-87 to trypsin ratio of 40:1 at 25 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 as described previously (13Chapman-Smith A.

The digestion products were separated either on sodium dodecyl sulfate-Tricine polyacrylamide gels (19Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol.

Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) concerning the stabilization of the BCCP biotinyl domain was that the increased stability may not due to biotinylation per se, but rather could be a consequence of interactions with the BirA biotin ligase, the enzyme catalyzing the modification reaction. The rationale for this hypothesis was that the reaction mechanism of E. coli biotin ligase is known to involve major structural rearrangements of the enzyme (21Beckett D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 424-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 22Xu Y. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Xu Y. Nenortas E. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16624-16631Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and it seemed possible that these conformational changes could be relayed to the biotinyl domain substrate. Moreover, alterations in domain tertiary structure upon biotinylation could aid in dissociation of the ligase-holo biotinoyl domain complex. These putative ligase-domain interactions would result in changing the conformation of the domain such that it became more stably folded than the apo form. Subsequent determinations of the structure of the apoprotein that allowed comparison with the holo form showed that conformational changes would necessarily be small (9Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan J.E., Jr. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Yao X. Wei D. Soden C., Jr. Summers M.F. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15089-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Yao X. Soden C., Jr. Summers M.F. Beckett D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, there are several reported differences in the structures of the holo and apo domains that could have been imparted by interaction with BirA during the biotinylation reaction. For example, Yao and co-workers (10Yao X. Wei D. Soden C., Jr. Summers M.F. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15089-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported that the hairpin turn that contains the biotinylated lysine is twisted in the holo form, but is not twisted in the apo form. The hypothesis of a conformational change imparted by interaction with BirA was difficult to test, because biotin ligase treatment was the only method available to specifically biotinylate the domain, and we know of no method to remove the biotin moiety from the intact domain. We now report a means to test this hypothesis by preparation of a biotin domain modified such that the lysine residue targeted for biotinylation was the sole amino group of the protein. This allowed biotinylation by use of a chemical acylation reaction that was specific to amino groups under the experimental conditions chosen. The “sole-amino” form of the biotin domain was prepared in two stages. In the first stage all of the lysine residues except that targeted for biotinylation were converted to arginine residues by oligonucleotide cassette mutagenesis of the BCCP-87 coding sequence (17Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37355-37364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Arginine was chosen to retain the sensitivity of the protein to trypsin digestion, since this is a valuable conformational probe of BCCP-87 structure (13Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The substitutions of arginine for lysine also retained the charge and extended the aliphatic chain of the original residues. As expected from the surface location of the lysine residues, the modified protein (called 4K to 4R) seemed well folded, since it was readily purified by our standard protocol and was a good substrate for biotin ligase in vitro and in vivo. More definitive was the observation that the 4K to 4R domain retained full function in vivo when converted to a full-length BCCP (17Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37355-37364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although arginine residues cannot be chemically acylated at physiological pH values (due to the very high pKavalues of guanidino groups) (24Means G.E. E. F.R. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, Inc., San Francisco, CA1971Google Scholar), the 4K to 4R domain retained a group in addition to that of the target lysine that could be acylated, the N terminus of the protein. This amino group cannot be removed by mutagenesis, and since N termini generally have lower pKa values than lysine ε-amino groups (24Means G.E. E. F.R. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, Inc., San Francisco, CA1971Google Scholar), selective acylation of the target lysine was precluded. Therefore, we explored several in vivo modifications to block the BCCP N terminus and found N-formylation to be the most effective means. We took advantage of the pathway of initiation of protein synthesis in bacteria (25Schmitt E. Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Dardel F. Blanquet S. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in which the N-terminal methionine is incorporated as the N-formylated species by use of the initiator tRNA carrying N-formylmethionine. In the normal course of protein synthesis the N-formyl group is cleaved from the nascent peptide by peptide deformylase. Following deformylation the methionine residue is removed by methionine aminopeptidase, but only if the penultimate residue has a small side chain (25Schmitt E. Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Dardel F. Blanquet S. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our prior work showed that methionine aminopeptidase is inactive on formyl peptides, and thus methionine removal is dependent on deformylase action (16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We also showed that anN-formylated biotinoyl domain accumulated in vivowhen peptide deformylase activity was blocked by mutation (16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However since peptide deformylase is an essential enzyme, synthesis of theN-formylated protein required several cumbersome manipulations. Moreover, these manipulations generated large amounts of a yellow compound (presumably a folate metabolite) that complicated purification of the domain (16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Since that work was reported, actinonin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic of previously unknown function, has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of the E. colipeptide deformylase targeted to the active site (26Chen D.Z. Patel D.V. Hackbarth C.J. Wang W. Dreyer G. Young D.C. Margolis P.S., Wu, C., Ni, Z.J. Trias J. White R.J. Yuan Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Actinonin addition has no effect on wild type E. coli strains, because the efflux pump encoded by the acr genes rapidly exports the inhibitor. However when the pump is inactivated by mutation of theacr or tolC genes, actinonin becomes a potent inhibitor of growth (26Chen D.Z. Patel D.V. Hackbarth C.J. Wang W. Dreyer G. Young D.C. Margolis P.S., Wu, C., Ni, Z.J. Trias J. White R.J. Yuan Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although accumulation ofN-formylated proteins had not been demonstrated in actinonin-treated E. coli cells, the finding that growth inhibition was overcome by overproduction of the deformylase indicated that the primary target of actinonin was peptide deformylase (26Chen D.Z. Patel D.V. Hackbarth C.J. Wang W. Dreyer G. Young D.C. Margolis P.S., Wu, C., Ni, Z.J. Trias J. White R.J. Yuan Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To use actinonin as a peptide deformylase inhibitor we inactivated theacr efflux pump by introduction of atolC::Tn10 mutation into the host strains used for protein expression. By judicious addition of actinonin to cultures of the tolC strain induced for expression of the 4K to 4R BCCP-87 domain we obtained large amounts of theN-formylated apo species of the protein that was readily purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography and had a mass of 9474.1, a value in excellent agreement with the calculated mass of 9473.9 (Fig. 1A). (This to our knowledge is the first demonstration of the accumulation of anN-formylated protein due to actinonin treatment.) It should be noted that we were unable to completely inhibit deformylase action even at very high actinonin concentrations and thus had to separate theN-formyl apo-BCCP-87 species from the other BCCP-87 species. A possible explanation for the partial inhibition observed is that peptide deformylase can use a variety of metal ions that impart greatly differing actinonin sensitivities (26Chen D.Z. Patel D.V. Hackbarth C.J. Wang W. Dreyer G. Young D.C. Margolis P.S., Wu, C., Ni, Z.J. Trias J. White R.J. Yuan Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It seems possible that in vivo a mixture of different metal ion forms of peptide deformylase is present. As expected the N-formyl apo-BCCP-87 had a trypsin sensitivity quite similar to that of the unformylated protein. Indeed by reversed phase high pressure chromatography all of the BCCP species examined in this work were found to release marker tryptic peptides in the same pattern and relative amounts as previously demonstrated for the wild type and several mutant proteins (13Chapman-Smith A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We then used biotionyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide to biotinylate the sole amino group of the N-formyl apo-BCCP-87 protein, that of the lysine 122 side chain. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis showed that the chemical modification procedure shifted the N-formyl apo-BCCP species to an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the protein biotinylated in vivo, indicating that a positive charge had been neutralized and mass spectral analysis (Fig.1B) gave a mass of 9699.8 for the chemically biotinylated protein, a value in excellent agreement with the calculated mass of 9700.2. These results showed that each biotinylated N-formyl BCCP molecule contained only a single amide-linked biotin moiety, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the acylation reaction. It should be noted that BCCP-87 contains a single cysteine residue that upon reaction with biotionyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide would give a biotin thioester. However, cysteine biotinylation was not observed presumably due to the inaccessibility of the cysteine residue (which resides in the hydrophobic core of the domain) plus the conditions used for the acylation reaction (which were conducive to thioester hydrolysis). We then compared the trypsin sensitivity of the chemically biotinylated protein to that of biotinylated protein obtained by biotinylationin vivo (Fig. 2, Aand B). Several sites in BCCP-87 have very similar sensitivities to trypsin cleavage in both the apo and holo species (13Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,16Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan J.E., Jr. J. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and thus the only bands present on these gels are those of the full-length proteins. Therefore, quantitation of the rate of digestion by loss of band intensity was straightforward. The trypsin sensitivities of the two proteins were very similar, but more importantly upon chemical biotinylation theN-formyl 4K to 4R protein became as stable as the holo form obtained by biotinylation"
https://openalex.org/W1964320911,"The hyaluronan (HA) synthases catalyze the addition of two different monosaccharides from UDP-sugar substrates to the linear heteropolysaccharide chain. To accomplish this task, the HA synthases must be able to bind and to transfer from both UDP-sugar substrates. Until now, it has been impossible to distinguish between these two abilities. We have created a mutant of xlHAS1, a HA synthase from <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, that allows for the examination of the enzyme's ability to bind substrate only. The ability of different compounds to protect the xlHAS1(C337S) mutant enzyme from loss of activity due to treatment with N-ethylmaleimide, a cysteine-modifying reagent, yields information on the relative affinity of a variety of nucleotides and nucleotide-sugars. We have observed that the substrate binding selectivity is more relaxed than the specificity of catalytic transfer. The only attribute that appears to be absolutely required for binding is a nucleotide containing two phosphates complexed with magnesium ion. The role of certain cysteine residues in catalysis was also evaluated. Cys<sup>307</sup> of xlHAS1 may play a role in catalysis or in maintaining structure. Mutation of Cys<sup>337</sup> raises the UDP-GlcUA Michaelis constant (<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>), suggesting that this residue participates in UDP-GlcUA substrate binding or in catalytic complex formation."

We predicted that βSer66 and αArg132 of TF1 (corresponding to βAla81 and αPro133 of CF1) play a central role in conferring tentoxin resistance to TF1. To test these predictions based on the static picture provided by the crystal structure, we prepared two mutants of the α3β3γ complex of the tentoxin-insensitive TF1, where the two critical residues βSer66and αArg132 were replaced by alanine and by proline, respectively, as found in the corresponding position of CF1. The results of this mutagenesis study show how inhibition of ATP hydrolysis responds to subtle changes of the protein structure.

ATP hydrolysis activity was determined using an ATP regenerating system (20Stiggal D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with an UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Lambda 40, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The absorption at 340 nm of a reaction mixture containing 50 mmMOPS/KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 40 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 40 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase was measured for 1 min, then the ATP hydrolysis reaction was started by addition of 2 μg of α3β3γ, and the absorption change was observed for 8 min. Activities were calculated from the slope 2 min after starting the ATP hydrolysis reaction using the extinction coefficient of NADH at 340 nm of 6230 m −1cm−1. A superimposition of the structure of the CF1-tentoxin complex (13Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with the structure of the α3β3 subcomplex of TF1 (11Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y.

Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which is shown in Fig. 1, B and C, revealed that the positions of residues αLeu65, αVal75, and αLeu238, which probably form important hydrophobic contacts with the inhibitor, are essentially conserved as well as the position of the crucial residue Asp83 in the β subunit (Fig. 1 B). Calculation of potential hydrogen bonds showed that the carboxyl side chain of βAsp83 is hydrogen-bonded to the amide hydrogens of leucine 2 and glycine 4 in the tentoxin molecule, which aligns the inhibitor in the binding cleft formed at the αβ-interface (13Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In TF1 this critical interaction is probably impaired by a potential hydrogen bond formed between βAsp68(βAsp83 of CF1) and the hydroxyl group of βSer66 (corresponding to βAla81 in CF1), which prevents correct tentoxin binding (13Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition the superimposition of the two F1 structures clearly visualizes the potential critical role of residue αPro133 in tentoxin binding in CF1. In TF1 this residue is replaced by arginine (αArg132), whose bulky side chain seems to block access to the tentoxin binding site (Fig. 1 C). ATP hydrolysis activities of the thermophilic α3β3γ complexes carrying the mutations βSer66 → Ala (α3β3γ(βS66A)) or αArg132→ Pro (α3β3γ(αR132P)) were measured with an ATP regenerating system and compared with wild-type TF1 α3β3γ (Fig. 2). The specific activity in the absence of tentoxin was 9–10 units/mg for all three enzymes, comparable with values previously reported for wild-type TF1α3β3γ (9Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the mutations per se do not significantly influence ATP hydrolysis activity. After preincubation with tentoxin, ATP hydrolysis by TF1 α3β3γ (βS66A) declined remarkably (Fig. 2). Significant inhibition was observed using >1 μm tentoxin; the concentration dependence of inhibition was exceptionally steep when 5–20 μm tentoxin were used. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained with 5–10 μm tentoxin, and maximal inhibition of 65–70% was achieved with about 20 μm of the inhibitor. Increasing the tentoxin concentration up to 100 μm did not enhance the inhibition, and concentrations >100 μm led to a slight re-activation of the enzyme. In contrast, only a slight decrease of activity, amounting to about 10% inhibition, was observed when 20–100 μm tentoxin were added to wild-type TF1α3β3γ or the mutant TF1α3β3γ (αR132P) (Fig. 2). The degree of inhibition, about 70% determined for TF1α3β3γ (βS66A), is comparable with values reported earlier for the Mg-ATPase activity of chloroplast F1-ATPase (16Tucker W.C., Du, Z. Hein R. Grometh-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7543-7548Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Tucker W.C., Du, Z. Grometh-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and for chimeric mutants constructed by reconstitution of mutated α subunits derived from R. rubrum and β and γ subunits derived from CF1 (16Tucker W.C., Du, Z. Hein R. Grometh-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7543-7548Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The KI value measured here was significantly lower than the KI value of about 10−8 m published for CF1 (6Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Moal G. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Mochimaru M. Sakurai H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but comparable with values reported for the above-mentioned chimeric enzymes (16Tucker W.C., Du, Z. Hein R. Grometh-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7543-7548Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A re-activation of the enzyme as observed here in the presence of tentoxin concentrations >100 μm was previously also reported for CF1 and explained by the binding of a second and possibly a third tentoxin molecule to the F1 complex, which by an unknown mechanism may relieve inhibition. Functional binding of tentoxin seems to depend essentially on correct hydrogen bonding between the amide hydrogens from the tentoxin backbone and residue βAsp83 (13Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the thermophilic F1 this important hydrogen bonding is obviously affected by a potential hydrogen bond formed between βAsp68 and the side chain of the adjacent residue βSer66 (3.3 Å). A similar competition for intermolecular (βAsp-TTX) and intramolecular hydrogen bonding (β66–68) is avoided in the tentoxin-sensitive CF1 complex as the chloroplast β subunit contains alanine in the equivalent position of the binding site (βAla81). For the same reason tentoxin sensitivity can probably be achieved in the F1 complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardii simply by the replacement of βGlu83 by aspartate (15Hu D. Fiedler H.R. Golan T. Edelmann M. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), as a proline residue, which has no capability to form hydrogen bonds, is located in the adjacent (n-2) position. A steric effect on the binding of the inhibitor caused by the side chain located in position 81 seems unlikely as alanine and serine show about the same surface volume of 89 Å3. In addition the even more bulky threonine (surface volume 116 Å3) or proline side chain (surface volume 113 Å3) is found in the equivalent position of the binding side in the tentoxin-sensitive F1 complex from Syneccococcus PC6301 or in the Chlamydomonas βGlu83 → Asp F1mutant (15Hu D. Fiedler H.R. Golan T. Edelmann M. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus the structural requirement in the β subunit for effective tentoxin binding is apparently to avoid any intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the crucial aspartate in position 83. Although the available structural information (Fig. 1 C; see also Ref. 13Groth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that in wild-type TF1 α3β3γ the bulky side chain αArg132 blocks access to the tentoxin binding niche; its replacement by proline did not have a significant effect on tentoxin sensitivity. Furthermore, the double mutant TF1 α3β3γ (αR132P/βS66A) displayed the same tentoxin sensitivity as the single mutant TF1 α3β3γ (βS66A) (data not shown), indicating that steric hindrance by this bulky side chain is not a predominant factor for tentoxin binding. The reason why the mutation failed to show the result expected from the CF1 and TF1 structures might be related to a substitution of αLeu125 by proline in the native TF1 complex (surface volume: Leu, 167 Å3; Pro, 112 Å3), which might compensate for the effect caused by the more bulky arginine side chain in position 132. In addition, the wild-type-like activity of the mutant might be explained by dynamic movements of this part of the α subunit during tentoxin binding, which are not visible in a static protein structure, but might be resolved by a set of intermediate structures (alternative conformations) or by dynamic studies. The point mutation βSer66 → Ala is sufficient to achieve maximal inhibition, underscoring the importance of the ability of the crucial residue βAsp68 (βAsp83 in CF1) to form hydrogen bonds with the tentoxin peptide backbone. The results from our mutagenesis studies indicate that prerequisites for inhibition by tentoxin are a tentoxin binding cleft, an aspartate side chain for correct hydrogen binding, and the absence of other residues that might interfere with this crucial hydrogen bond. The comparably high KI value determined here for tentoxin inhibition indicates that other amino acid residues, which probably are located in the α subunit, also influence the affinity for tentoxin. Experiments to elucidate the role of these residues in fine-tuning the affinity for tentoxin are presently under way in our laboratory. The results presented in this paper demonstrate in a remarkable way the feasibility of functional predictions based on structural information,e.g. for the design of special characteristics in a target protein. On the other hand, they also stress that, as it comes to functional considerations, structural dynamics should be taken into account.
