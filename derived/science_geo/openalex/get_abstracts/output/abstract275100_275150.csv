https://openalex.org/W2089919141,Male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) were conditioned to emit an instrumental response to obtain the visual image of another male of the species. The relative positive reinforcing effects of three visual stimuli capable of eliciting aggressive display were compared.
https://openalex.org/W2055408552,"Bursts of impulses in groups of brain cells of the nudibranch Tritonia trigger prolonged swimming that is identical to the natural escape response. The cells in which the activity occurs form two bilaterally symmetrical groups of at least 30 cells in each pleural ganglion. These neurons are interconnected by pathways that have a low electrical resistance, both within a ganglion and across the brain. Together they form a network that determinies whether a swimming escape response will occur or not by filtering out weak neural activity yet responding with a burst of impulses to intensive specific input to either group."

We tested the longitudinal validity and sensitivity to change of quantitative measurement of syndesmophytes using CT. Methods We performed lumbar spine CT scans on 33 patients with AS at baseline, 1 year and 2 years. Volumes and heights of syndesmophytes were computed in four intervertebral disk spaces. We compared the computed changes to a physician9s ratings of change based on CT scan inspection. Sensitivity to change of the computed measures was compared with that of the modified Stoke AS Spinal Score (radiography) and a scoring method based on MRI. Results At years 1 and 2, respectively 24 (73%) and 26 (79%) patients had syndesmophyte volume increases by CT. At years 1 and 2, the mean (SD) computed volume increases per patient were, respectively 87 (186) and 201 (366) mm3. Computed volume changes were strongly associated with the physician9s visual ratings of change (p Conclusions CT-based syndesmophytes measurements had very good longitudinal validity and better sensitivity to change than radiography or MRI. This method shows promise for longitudinal clinical studies of syndesmophyte development and growth."

https://openalex.org/W1969040166,"The phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of beta-adenosine-3'-beta-adenosine-5'-phosphoric acid in its aqueous solution (pH = 9.2) was studied. The signal consisted of eight peaks caused by the spin-spin coupling of the phosphorus nucleus with three protons, two on the 5' carbon, and one on the 3' carbon. The coupling constants were 3.4, 6.5, and 8.1 hertz; from these values the dihedral angles of the three P-O-C-H systems were estimated."

About half of the crystalline alpha-ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone isolated from the tobacco hornworms 7(1/2) to 8(1/2) days after injection was derived from endogenous steroid precursors and half from the transformation of the synthetic ecdysone analog."

https://openalex.org/W1982414346,"The oldest known ""carpoids"" of the echinoderm subphylum Homalozoa have been discovered in lower Middle Cambrian rocks of northern Utah. They were free-living benthonic animals characterized by a unique ctenoid feeding apparatus and flattened flexible theca with near bilateral symmetry. A new class, Ctenocystoidea, is proposed to include the new genus and new species, Ctenocystis utahensis."

https://openalex.org/W2007154510,"The white part of bird droppings (the urine) consists of microscopically uniform spheres 2 to 8 micrometers in diameter. Strange behavior of the spheres in polarized light indicates that they are often made of a spiraling arrangement of crystals that are particularly well revealed by the electron microscope. Bird urine has a varied composition, and x-ray analysis shows that it does not consist largely of uric acid, as has frequently been parroted."

https://openalex.org/W2012882605,"Crystalline catalase of high purity and activity was prepared from a heme-requiring Staphylococcus aureus mutant, JT/52, grown in the presence of heme. A crystalline protein was obtained from the same cells grown without heme. This enzymatically inactive protein and the catalase cross-react strongly when tested by a variety of immunochemical tests."
https://openalex.org/W1986583788,"The action of acid deoxyribonuclease on T5 bacteriophage DNA results in a ""random distribution"" of sizes of duplex fragments as judged by electron microscopy. No preferred subunit size resulting from the ""single hit"" action can be detected down to lengths of 0.1 micron or less. The results are in agreement with the coexistence of a ""single-hit"" and a ""double-hit"" kinetics."

During the same intervals changes in activity also occurred on the sea floor. This coincidence suggests worldwide effects of movement of crustal plates."
https://openalex.org/W1990591751,"A new, extremely sensitive method for the quantitative determination of tellurium is based on the induced precipitation of elemental gold from a 6N HCl solution containing gold chloride, cupric chloride, and hypophosphorous acid; the amount of gold reduced is proportional to the amount of tellurium present. As little as 1 nanogram (1 X 1O(-9) g) of tellurium gives a measurable reaction with 1 mg of gold in 50 ml of solution."

The calcium phosphate, precipitated at the site of the enzyme reaction, was converted into a visible precipitate. The enzyme activity appeared in bands perpendicular to the myofibrils."
