https://openalex.org/W2073386386,"Cellular oncogenes are DNA sequences implicated in the genesis of cancer, but their functions in the transformation process are not understood. Our experiments provide data linking expression of two well-studied proto-oncogenes, c-myc and c-rasKi, to current knowledge of proliferation control and its perturbation by differentiation and chemical transformation. Growth stimulation of quiescent cells by serum elevates expression of the myc proto-oncogene in Balb/c 3T3 (A31) cells. In two chemically transformed A31 derivatives (BPA31 and DA31), c-myc expression is constitutive. The levels of c-myc mRNA in quiescent and growing transformed cells are nearly the same, and are only slightly elevated compared to the level found in growing A31 cells. By contrast, c-rasKi expression is cell-cycle-dependent in BPA31 cells. The relative abundance of c-rasKi mRNA begins to increase in mid- to late G0/G1. During terminal differentiation of teratocarcinoma stem cells (F9) into nonproliferating endoderm, relative mRNA abundance is diminished more markedly for c-myc than for c-rasKi. These results demonstrate that expression of the myc and rasKi protooncogenes is dependent upon the cellular growth state, and that growth control exhibits growth-factor-dependent, cell-cycle-timed oncogene expression. In the case of the BPA31 cells, c-myc is not rearranged, amplified, or overexpressed. However, the oncogene has lost its cycle-dependent regulation in the chemically transformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W2024881871,"An important early event in mammalian gustatory transduction with respect to sodium chloride has been found to be the passage of sodium ions through specific transport pathways in the apical region of the taste bud. The inward current caused by sodium chloride placed on the mucosal surface of an in vitro preparation of rat dorsal lingual epithelium can be substantially reduced by the blocker of sodium ion transport, amiloride. The data show (i) that amiloride is a specific blocker of the chorda tympani response to sodium chloride, but not to potassium chloride, (ii) that the sodium and potassium gustatory systems are largely independent at the peripheral level, and (iii) that the classical ion taste ""receptor"" is actually a specific transport pathway permitting the cation to enter the taste-bud cell and thereby to spread depolarizing current."
https://openalex.org/W2054323226,"Phagocytosis of Legionella pneumophila, a bacterial pathogen that multiplies intracellularly in human mononuclear phagocytes and causes Legionnaires' disease, occurs by a novel mechanism. A phagocyte pseudopod coils around the bacterium as the organism is internalized. Human monocytes, alveolar macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes all phagocytize L. pneumophila by this unusual process, termed “coiling phagocytosis,” and these leukocytes phagocytize not only live L. pneumophila in this way, but also formalin-killed, glutaraldehyde-killed, and heat-killed L. pneumophila. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, monocytes phagocytize Streptococcus pneumoniae, encapsulated and unencapsulated E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis by conventional phagocytosis. Treatment of L. pneumophila with high-titer anti-L. pneumophila antibody abolishes coiling phagocytosis; such bacteria are internalized by conventional phagocytosis. These experiments raise the possibility that a surface component of L. pneumophila mediates the unusual response by the phagocyte. Such a component, if elaborated in vivo, might be responsible for extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionnaires' disease suspected of being toxin-mediated."

https://openalex.org/W2030340093,"Release of CHO-K1 cells from plateau or stationary phase and reentry into the cell cycle is specifically and reversibly blocked at two distinct sites by the anticalmodulin drug W13. The first block occurs early during release while the cells are still at G0/ G1, whereas the second occurs later in reentry during early S phase. As determined by radioimmunoassay, calmodulin levels undergo changes at three distinct steps in plateau-phase entry and release. First, the entry of exponentially growing cells into plateau phase is accompanied by an increase in the calmodulin level. The second change is a reduction in the calmodulin content of cells within the first hour following release from plateau phase. The third change is the subsequent increase in calmodulin levels, which precedes entry of the cells into S phase. Analysis of calmodulin mRNA levels by dot-blot hybridization demonstrates that the changes in calmodulin protein are preceded by changes in calmodulin mRNA. Furthermore, whereas a decrease in CaM mRNA is observed within the first hour following plateau release, no such decrease is observed for β-actin mRNA, suggesting that this decrease may be selective for calmodulin. This selectivity is further substantiated by the fact that identical changes in calmodulin and calmodulin mRNA are observed in cells released from plateau by two different techniques. Taken together, these data suggest that calmodulin may play an important role in the reentry of cells into the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1510552705,"Concentrations of rhein and nitrofurantoin in the micromolar range induce Ca2+ release and the development of increased inner membrane permeability in liver mitochondria. Both compounds inhibit the mitochondrial glutathione reductase causing a depletion of GSH and an accumulation of GSSG in energized mitochondria. Under these conditions, the compounds also alter the oxidation state of pyridine nucleotides, NADH becoming oxidized while NADPH remains reduced. Using rhein or nitrofurantoin, together with t-butyl-hydroperoxide and beta-hydroxybutyrate, it is possible to selectively alter the NAD/NADH, the NADP/NADPH, and the GSSG/GSH ratios and to determine the effect of these different states on the ability of Ca2+ to produce a permeable inner membrane. No correlation between pyridine nucleotide ratios and sensitivity to Ca2+ was observed. Mitochondria are stable to Ca2+ when the GSH content is high, but become permeable when Ca2+ is present and GSH is converted to GSSG. It is proposed that the GSSG/GSH ratio, by controlling the reduction state of critical sulfhydryl groups, regulates lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity and, therefore, the ability of mitochondria to remain impermeable upon activation of the intramitochondrial Ca2+ requiring phospholipase A2."
https://openalex.org/W1592278061,"In a systematic search for effectors of glutathione peroxidase, a number of mercaptocarboxylic acids and tertiary mercaptans were found to be strong and specific inhibitors of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. Assessment of various models was made by linear and nonlinear least squares fitting techniques. The results support the formation of reversible enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The active site selenium is trapped by the rapid binding of the inhibitor in competition with GSH. Data are consistent with the formation of thioselenenate adducts of the active site. The kinetic model which best describes the observed inhibition by the very strong inhibitor mercaptosuccinate implies that a selenenic acid with a kinetically significant lifetime is not formed when hydroperoxide is reduced. A noncovalent binding site for GSH or the presence of a cysteine residue at the active site of the enzyme provides a mechanistic rationale for the observed kinetics. Three of the most potent inhibitors found in this study, mercaptosuccinate, penicillamine, and alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine, are currently used as slow-acting drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Overall, the evidence suggests that glutathione peroxidase may be involved in the etiology of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018335584,"Human metallothionein-IIA (hMT-IIA) gene expression is regulated by heavy metals and glucocorticoids. When the cloned hMT-IIA gene or its 5′-flanking DNA structure fused to herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) structural gene sequences were transferred into TK− Rat 2 fibroblasts, both genes were inducible by Cd++ and/or dexamethasone. Placement of the hMT-IIA gene 5′-flanking region, either intact of deleted in its TATA box and cap site, upstream of the HSV-TK gene promoter rendered the latter both glucocorticoid- and heavy metal-inducible. Thus the structure that mediates both Cd++ and glucocorticoid responsiveness is present in the hMT-IIA gene 5′-flanking DNA, does not require its TATA box or cap site, and can activate a heterologous promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2009594637,"We performed a deletion analysis to identify the minimal DNA sequence required for the function of the T4 late promoter, P23. A minipromoter derivative of P23 was constructed, containing 35 bp of T4 DNA from -18 to +17 with respect to the transcriptional initiation site. This derivative retains the TATAAATA homology and is competent to serve as a T4 late promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Its transcriptional activity in vivo is regulated identically to a wild-type plasmid-borne P23, requiring the function of T4 genes essential for late transcription, but not requiring T4 DNA replication. Recombination with the T4 phage chromosome is not significant for mini-P23 activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2019638314,"In the lateral edge of the ""white matter"" in the lamprey spinal cord, there is a group of nerve cells referred to as edge cells. The results of a combined physiological, light microscopical, and electron microscopical study suggest that these cells serve as intraspinal mechanoreceptors. Edge cells are depolarized on stretch of the lateral margin of the spinal cord, and they have nestlike ramifications in this region oriented in a rostrocaudal plane. These cells exhibit a close structural similarity with the crayfish stretch receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2073190753,"Two human genes that are homologous to both the murine transforming gene (oncogene) v-raf and the chicken transforming gene v-mil have been mapped by means of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids to human chromosomes previously devoid of known oncogenes. One gene, c-raf-2, which appears to be a processed pseudogene, is located on chromosome 4. The other gene, c-raf-1, which appears to be the active gene, is located on chromosome 3 and has been regionally mapped by chromosomal in situ hybridization to 3p25. This assignment correlates with specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with certain human malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2029399853,"Cultures of human diploid fibroblasts contain cells that respond to exposure to the first component of complement (C1) by initiating DNA synthesis and growth. The plasma membranes of these cells have specific binding sites for the C1q subcomponent of C1. A fluorescence-activated cell sorter was used to isolate a subset of cells with a high affinity for C1q, and the growth and synthesis activities of these high-affinity cells were studied after numerous replications in vitro. These cells synthesize DNA and grow faster than the parent cultures and low-affinity cells, and they produce two to three times as much protein. About 40 percent of their total protein synthesis activity is directed to collagen production, unusually high proportions of collagen types III and V being produced. These properties and the high affinity of the cells for C1q are retained for at least six cell transfers. This phenotype has the properties expected of fibroblasts in healing wounds and inflamed tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2069736599,"Several genes for variant antigens in trypanosomes are activated by duplicative translocation to a telomeric expression site. A second—nonduplicative—mode of activation is restricted to telomeric antigen genes. We show here that the single telomeric gene for antigen 221 can be activated in both ways. We also show that gene 221 is split and that the 5′ 35 nucleotide sequence, common to all surface antigen mRNAs, is not encoded within 8.5 kb upstream of the 221 coding region. No major rearrangements are observed within 55 kb upstream of the 221 coding region upon nonduplicative activation. Gene inactivation is usually accompanied by deletion of the gene and at least 8.5 kb upstream and may involve conversion by another telomere. These results are not readily explained by a single expression site model. The duplicative gene 221 activation differs from conventional duplicative activation in the extent of the transposed segment, which is larger and may include the entire segment between gene and telomere."

https://openalex.org/W1515088892,"In order to evaluate whether functional differences exist between allelic variants (allozymes) of the B-type lactate dehydrogenase (L-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) in the fish Fundulus heteroclitus, the kinetic properties were examined. Differences in product inhibition between allelic isozymes were observed. LDH-Bb4 was found to be inhibited by lower concentrations of both lactate and pyruvate than either LDH-Ba/Bb or LDH-Ba4. While the pH and temperature dependence for maximal catalysis (Vmax) in both the forward and reverse directions were indistinguishable among the allozymes, reaction velocities at low substrate concentrations (Vmax/Km) were significantly different. These differences could be explained by LDH-Bb4 having a greater substrate affinity than LDH-Ba4 at cold temperatures while the reverse was true at elevated temperatures. At a given pH, LDH-Bb4 showed a greater reaction rate at lower temperatures (e.g. 10 degrees C) than LDH-Ba4. The phenomenon was reversed at higher temperatures (e.g. greater than 35 degrees C). When reaction rates were compared at constant relative alkalinity, that is, a constant [OH-]/[H+] ratio, similar findings were obtained. The response for the heterozygous allozyme, LDH-Ba/Bb, was not the arithmetic average of the two homotetrameric allozymes. The biological significance of these allozymic differences is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1524145479,"Studies with RU26988, a synthetic glucocorticoid which does not bind to aldosterone receptors, suggest glucocorticoid-induced colonic cation transport is affected through glucocorticoid-specific receptors. RU26988 produced a 700% increase in sodium absorption and doubled transmural potential difference in proximal and distal colon of adrenalectomized rats. Scatchard analysis suggested a single class of receptors with a KD of approximately 10(-9) M. Competition of unlabeled steroids for [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-binding sites paralleled the steroids' biologic potency as glucocorticoids. Heat treatment (25 degrees C, 30 min) markedly enhanced binding of the glucocorticoid-receptor complexes to DNA-cellulose. The activated receptor from both proximal and distal colon was eluted in the prewash from DEAE-Sephadex A-50 anion exchange columns both in the presence and absence of protease inhibitors and has an estimated molecular weight (Stokes radius) of 33,000-37,000 (25-26 A). These results identify the colonic receptor as glucocorticoid binder IB, a receptor previously identified as the major binder only in kidney cortex. The finding of an apparently unique receptor in the two tissues where glucocorticoids stimulate cation transport suggests that the phenotypic response mediated by glucocorticoids in different tissues might be determined by the structure of the receptor and that glucocorticoid binder IB is the glucocorticoid cation transport receptor."

Selenium supplementation corrected the anemia, prevented Heinz body formation, increased the body weight of cows and calves, and elevated blood selenium. This may be the first recorded example of widespread anemia in a population due to selenium deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1963630965,"The kinetoplast DNA of Crithidia fasciculata is a massive network composed of thousands of topologically interlocked circles. Most of these circles are minicircles (2.5 kb), and about 50 are maxicircles (37 kb). Previous studies showed that minicircles replicate, after release from the network, via Cairns (theta) intermediates. Here we show that maxicircles replicate, while attached to the network, by an entirely different mechanism involving rolling circle intermediates. After the network-bound maxicircle has finished replication, the branch of the rolling circle is apparently cleaved off to form a linear free maxicircle. A restriction map of the linearized free maxicircles shows that these molecules have unique termini, one of which presumably corresponds to the replication origin."
https://openalex.org/W1507982628,"Three insulin receptor subunits prepared from the purified receptor were isolated and characterized. Peptide mapping of the isolated subunits revealed that the Mr = 125,000 subunit (alpha) is distinct from the Mr = 90,000 subunit (beta) whereas the Mr = 50,000 subunit (beta 1) shows considerable structural homology to beta, indicating that the alpha and beta subunits are components of the intact insulin receptor. From two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol, the purified insulin receptor was shown to be composed of heterogeneous disulfide-linked complexes of (alpha 2, 2 beta), (alpha 2, beta, beta 1), (alpha 2, 2 beta 1), (alpha 2), (alpha beta), and (alpha beta 1). The largest disulfide-linked complex (alpha 2, 2 beta) appears to be the minimum unit of the intact insulin receptor whereas the other complexes appear to be generated from (alpha 2, 2 beta) by proteolytic degradation and/or reduction. These studies provide conclusive evidence that the alpha 2 beta 2 complex is the basic structural unit of insulin receptor, as previously proposed from affinity cross-linking experiments using crude membranes by Czech's group (Czech, M. P., Massague, J., and Pilch, P. F. (1981) Trends Biochem. Sci. 6, 222-225). The biochemical approach described here should allow us to further elucidate the mechanism of insulin action."

https://openalex.org/W1634894509,"Mouse heart cells in culture synthesized and secreted a nerve growth factor (NGF) which cross-reacted with mouse submaxillary gland beta NGF. The synthesis of NGF by heart cells was greatly reduced by addition of actinomycin D or cycloheximide but not by cytosine arabinoside, suggesting that the synthesis of NGF by heart cells required DNA transcription but not DNA replication. Heart NGF and beta NGF were virtually equivalent with respect to the neurite outgrowth stimulating activity and immunologically indistinguishable. The molecular weight of heart NGF estimated by the gel filtration method was identical with that of beta NGF. Isoelectric point of heart NGF was about 9.5, like beta NGF. These results suggest that NGF synthesized and secreted by mouse heart cells is an identical molecule to beta NGF of the mouse submaxillary gland."

High concentrations of kainic acid killed the cells, but when exposed to sublethal doses they contracted their dendritic fields and sent sprouting processes into the inner retina. It appears that kainic acid can induce neuronal growth as well as degeneration and that the potential for morphological plasticity is still present in neurons of the adult mammalian retina."
https://openalex.org/W1509382424,"3-Deazaadenosine (c3Ado) inhibits the ability of specifically sensitized mouse lymphocytes to lyse tumor cells, and this effect of c3Ado on immune function is accompanied by a buildup of both S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and S-3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine (c3AdoHcy) within the lymphocytes (Zimmerman, T. P., Wolberg, G., and Duncan, G. S. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 6220-6224). Several types of evidence have now been obtained which indicate that neither of these latter two biochemical events contributes to this biological activity of c3Ado. First, periodate-oxidized adenosine (Adox) and 3-deaza(+/-)aristeromycin, two compounds which are not inhibitory to this lymphocyte function, were both more effective than c3Ado in elevating lymphocyte AdoHcy levels and in inhibiting protein carboxymethylation within these cells. Second, pretreatment of lymphocytes with Adox (to inhibit AdoHcy hydrolase) prevented the metabolic formation of c3AdoHcy during subsequent incubation of the cells with c3Ado without diminishment of the biological activity of c3Ado. Third, the lymphocyte buildup of c3AdoHcy exhibited a concentration dependence upon c3Ado which was biphasic and greatly dissimilar to that for the inhibition of lymphocyte function by c3Ado. These results are not compatible with the widely held view that c3Ado, as a single agent, affects various cellular functions as a consequence of elevations in intracellular AdoHcy and/or c3AdoHcy and suggest that c3Ado inhibits this particular lymphocyte function by an unknown mechanism which is independent of the interaction of c3Ado with AdoHcy hydrolase. During this study, it was found that pretreatment of lymphocytes with Adox prevented the potentiation by homocysteine of this immunoinhibitory activity of c3Ado and reduced the biological effect of the c3Ado/homocysteine combination to that observed with c3Ado alone. This result indicates that the ability of homocysteine to potentiate this biological activity of c3Ado requires the metabolic formation of c3AdoHcy catalyzed by AdoHcy hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1540259475,"We describe a new, rapid, and convenient procedure for purifying 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetases, employing precipitation with ammonium sulfate, fractionation by gel filtration, rapid binding to poly(I) X poly(C) cellulose, and elution with 0.35 M KCl. Unlike previously published methods, the procedure does not require sedimentation of the enzyme at 200,000 X g. Therefore, it is more general and more likely to succeed with synthetases extracted from a variety of cells or tissues, or from different subcellular fractions. We have purified the enzymes from two sources to apparent homogeneity, about 2500-fold from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells in 40% yield and more than 400,000-fold from the cytoplasm of rabbit reticulocytes in 25% yield. The specific activity of the HeLa enzyme is about 4 times higher than reported previously. The physical and functional properties of the pure enzymes are very similar to those reported by others for preparations of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase from rabbit reticulocytes, mouse L cells, and human HeLa cells. A new affinity matrix was prepared by linking periodate-oxidized poly(I) X poly(C) to a hydrazide derivative of finely divided cellulose. Poly(I) X poly(C) cellulose binds about twice as much synthetase as the corresponding amount of poly(I) X poly(C) paper and activates the bound enzyme about three times better."
https://openalex.org/W1521257073,"In order to evaluate whether structural differences exist between allelic variants of a B-type lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; L-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) in the minnow Fundulus heteroclitus, the allozymes (LDH-Ba4, LDH-Ba/Bb, and LDH-Bb4) were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Each variant was characterized as to holoenzyme and subunit molecular mass, isoelectric point (pI), thermal and urea stability, and susceptibility to proteolysis. Differences in electrophoretic mobilities were due to a lower pI for LDH-Ba4 (pI = 6.6) than for LDH-Bb4 (pI = 7.2). Stability to inactivation by heat, urea, and proteolysis was in each case: LDH-Bb4 greater than LDH-Ba/Bb greater than LDH-Ba4. Inactivation by trypsin may involve the arginine-rich catalytic loop of lactate dehydrogenase (50). The results suggest that the allozymes differ in their conformational flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W1548553374,"Several reports have appeared recently which contradict our earlier findings on the identity and characterization of chick progesterone receptor. Puri et al. (Puri, R. K., Grandics, P., Dougherty, J. J., and Toft, D. O. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10831-10837) have isolated a protein with a molecular weight of Mr approximately 88,000 and have reported that this protein is the “nontransformed” molybdate-stabilized receptor. Because of this discrepancy from our own work, we have repeated their methods and obtained purified samples of this protein. In this paper we show that the Mr = 88,000 +/- 2,000 protein is not a receptor but is apparently an artifact of the use of particular steroid affinity resins. Evidence presented to show that this protein is not the authentic receptor include: 1) it is obtained from affinity resins in 10-fold molar excess over the mass of authentic receptor; 2) its tryptic map does not resemble either authentic receptor subunit; 3) it can be resolved from authentic hormone-binding receptors on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography; 4) the protein does not bind progesterone; and finally 5) its elution from affinity matrices is not biospecific for progesterone and can even be eluted in equivalent yields with buffer alone. We conclude that the Mr = 88,000 protein is not a progesterone-binding protein."

Amino acid analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified a glutamic acid moiety. Direct insertion mass spectrometry proved the carbohydrate portion to be a sugar phosphate. NaB3H4 reduction and borate electrophoresis, paper chromatography, and enzymatic digestion indicated the presence of ribose 5-phosphate.

https://openalex.org/W1491813767,"The interaction of micromolar concentrations of palmitic and oleic acids with the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane was studied by electron microscopic techniques in an attempt to define their different effects on ATP-induced calcium sequestration in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Oleic acid had a concentration-dependent effect on the morphology of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, promoting vesicle fusion and eventual solubilization. Palmitic acid did not alter the morphology of sarcoplasmic reticulum, but its probable site(s) of interaction could be determined. In the presence of palmitic acid, large lamellar structures that formed external to sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles are probably composed of pure palmitic acid and/or palmitic acid/phospholipid mixed micelles, but internalization of palmitic acid into sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was not detected. Palmitic acid reduced the phospholipid content of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes with a preservation of the average interparticle protein spacing as observed in freeze-fracture electron micrographs. Thus, palmitic acid appears to be incorporated into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lipid bi-layer. Oleic acid inhibition of ATP-induced calcium sequestration by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles is probably caused by net permeability changes of the membrane. A structural mechanism for palmitic acid stimulation of ATP-induced calcium sequestration is proposed in light of the probable insertion of palmitic acid into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lipid bilayer."

The combining sites of two of these (IgMWEA and IgMNAE) were essentially indistinguishable by quantitative precipitin studies at varying pH and by quantitative precipitin inhibition assays, but the other two differed in specificity of their combining sites from these and from each other. These differences were detected by precipitin inhibition assays with 3,4py beta DGal-containing oligosaccharide alditols, the R and S isomers of methyl 4,6py alpha DGal, the R isomer of methyl 4,6py beta DGal, or the R and S isomers of methyl 4,6py alpha DGlc, and -beta DGlc. In all of these except the S isomer of methyl 4,6pyDGal and R isomer of methyl 4,6pyDGlc, the carboxyl group is axial to the plane of the acetal ring. Their specificity appears to be determined by the nonreducing ends of chains and is considered to be cavity-type."

https://openalex.org/W1586369904,"A form of spontaneous Ca2+ release from purified light sarcoplasmic reticulum has been recently described (Palade, P., Mitchell, R. D., and Fleischer, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8098-8107). It is characterized by rapid Ca2+ efflux (1-10 mumol/min X mg protein) which begins only after a delay following preloading and depletion of extravesicular Ca2+. In the present study, the influences of a number of ionic factors modulating the spontaneous calcium release phenomenon are described. The divalent metal ions Mn2+ and Sr2+ and higher external [Mg2+] inhibit release. Mn2+ appears to inhibit from outside, whereas Sr2+ must be taken up to inhibit. Decreasing the phosphate concentration during preloading eliminates spontaneous release, but it can be partially restored with salts of other nonprecipitating anions. No such release was obtained with other Ca2+-precipitating anions, i.e. pyrophosphate, oxalate, and fluoride. The release characteristics are strongly dependent on the monovalent cation present. Spontaneous Ca2+ release is optimal at pH 6.8-7.0 and decreases sharply at higher and lower pH. Ca2+ release can be enhanced by addition, during the lag period, of concentrated salt solutions consisting of more permeant cations than anions, which may indicate that an inside positive membrane potential enhances the rate of calcium release. Spontaneous Ca2+ release can take place in the presence of sucrose, and Ca2+ efflux is not accompanied by a corresponding efflux of preloaded sucrose, demonstrating that the vesicles remain sealed during spontaneous release. The spontaneous Ca2+ release process is distinct from several other forms of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1527978164,"Abstract The apoenzyme of Pseudomonas cepacia salicylate hydroxylase was prepared by a dialysis method. The apoprotein retains a dimeric structure and binds one FAD per monomer. Flavin binding results in both 81 and 60% of quenching and 15- and 5-nm blue shifts of FAD and protein fluorescence, respectively. A hydrophobic environment for the flavin site and a conformational difference between apoprotein and holoenzyme are thus indicated. Prior binding of NADH markedly retards the holoenzyme activity development upon a subsequent FAD addition. Flavin 1,N6-ethenoadenine dinucleotide binds to the apoenzyme much more weakly than FAD but this reconstituted holoenzyme and the FAD X enzyme both exhibit similar activities. The adenine moiety appears to be important to binding. The formation of holoenzyme from apoprotein and FAD involves minimally a two-step reversible process, an initial flavin-binding step followed by a conformational transition. At both 6 and 23 degrees C, the rates of hydroxylase activity recovery can be correlated with the rates of FAD binding, indicating that the initial FAD X apoenzyme complex is fully active and the subsequent slow conformational change has no significant effect on the catalytic efficiency. Overall dissociation constants calculated based on kinetic data are essentially identical with those determined by equilibrium measurements."

https://openalex.org/W1575100308,"The intramolecular consequences, for the structural and functional integrity of labeled proteins, of the radiodecomposition of covalently bound 125I were analyzed, using the 125I-Tyr-54 derivative of the curarimimetic protein alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha BuTx) as a specific example. Mono- and di-iodinated alpha BuTx derivatives of high specific radioactivity were prepared and monitored for up to ten 125I half-lives. Analysis of the specific activity of a mono-125I-alpha BuTx as a function of storage time was carried out and revealed that at least 95.3% of all radiolabeled alpha BuTx molecules are inactivated by the decay event. Generation of radioactive fragments of low molecular weight was studied in several preparations of di-125I-alpha BuTx; it was found that approximately 89% of all decaying 125I-alpha BuTx molecules undergo fragmentation of the labeled tyrosyl moiety. It has long been known that covalently bound 125I cleaves and inactivates double-stranded DNA with extreme efficiency (see Halpern, A., and Stocklin, G. (1977) Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 14, 167-183; 257-274); the present findings establish that alpha BuTx, a protein, is similarly disabled by 125I decay."
https://openalex.org/W1592459539,"The effect of 4-deoxy-4-fluoro-D-mannose (4F-Man), a synthetic analog of D-mannose, on the synthesis of the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus was examined. Nearly confluent monolayers of cultured BHK21 cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus were incubated for 2 h with 4F-Man (0-10 mM) or for 1 h with tunicamycin (2 micrograms/ml) and then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine or [3H]glucosamine. After a 90-min chase period, the cells were lysed and the viral proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The 35S-labeled G protein from cells exposed to greater than or equal to 1 mM 4F-Man migrated more rapidly than G protein isolated from control cells and with the same electrophoretic mobility as the glycoprotein produced by cells treated with tunicamycin. When infected cells were labeled with [3H]glucosamine, little or no radioactivity was associated with G protein synthesized in the presence of greater than or equal to 1 mM 4F-Man. The conclusion that 4F-Man blocks the glycosylation of the G protein was supported by experiments which demonstrated that the fluorosugar inhibits the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W2401966018,"Ferrara type of β0 thalassaemia has two unusual features: first, normal β-globin chain synthesis is inducible either in cell-free systems prepared from patients' reticulocytes by adding supernatant factors from non-thalassaemic reticulocyte lysates1 or in heterologous cell-free translation of thalassaemic mRNA2; second, β-globin synthesis is inducible in patients in vivo after blood transfusion3,4. We now describe a molecular lesion of the β-globin gene that is common to nine cases of Ferrara β0 thalassaemia but cannot be reconciled with the inducible response."

Adequate funding for centers, research contracts, intramural research, and training is also necessary for creation of the science base essential to sustaining the powerful momentum of recent progress. The important question for the future is whether the present system is sufficiently flexible and imaginative to keep pace with the contemporary revolution in science."
