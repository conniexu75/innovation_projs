https://openalex.org/W2035849979,"Responses of sensory neurons differ across repeated measurements. This variability is usually treated as stochasticity arising within neurons or neural circuits. However, some portion of the variability arises from fluctuations in excitability due to factors that are not purely sensory, such as arousal, attention and adaptation. To isolate these fluctuations, we developed a model in which spikes are generated by a Poisson process whose rate is the product of a drive that is sensory in origin and a gain summarizing stimulus-independent modulatory influences on excitability. This model provides an accurate account of response distributions of visual neurons in macaque lateral geniculate nucleus and cortical areas V1, V2 and MT, revealing that variability originates in large part from excitability fluctuations that are correlated over time and between neurons, and that increase in strength along the visual pathway. The model provides a parsimonious explanation for observed systematic dependencies of response variability and covariability on firing rate."
https://openalex.org/W2014541905,"Lars Forsberg, Jan Dumanski and colleagues report that age-related loss of chromosome Y in peripheral blood is associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality, cancer mortality and non-hematological cancer mortality. Incidence and mortality for sex-unspecific cancers are higher among men, a fact that is largely unexplained1,2. Furthermore, age-related loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is frequent in normal hematopoietic cells3,4, but the phenotypic consequences of LOY have been elusive5,6,7,8,9,10. From analysis of 1,153 elderly men, we report that LOY in peripheral blood was associated with risks of all-cause mortality (hazards ratio (HR) = 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17–3.13; 637 events) and non-hematological cancer mortality (HR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.56–8.41; 132 events). LOY affected at least 8.2% of the subjects in this cohort, and median survival times among men with LOY were 5.5 years shorter. Association of LOY with risk of all-cause mortality was validated in an independent cohort (HR = 3.66) in which 20.5% of subjects showed LOY. These results illustrate the impact of post-zygotic mosaicism on disease risk, could explain why males are more frequently affected by cancer and suggest that chromosome Y is important in processes beyond sex determination. LOY in blood could become a predictive biomarker of male carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1999203943,"Molecular, pharmacological and functional data show that haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are predisposed to ER-stress-mediated apoptosis compared to closely related progenitors; a framework for understanding how stress signalling is coordinated within the hematopoietic hierarchy and integrated with stemness is provided, and may have implications for the improvement of clinical transplantation of HSCs. Haematopoietic stem cells persist throughout the lifespan of an organism in order to maintain a capacity for blood self-renewal. The combination of longevity with the latent potential to proliferate presents the danger that inappropriate cell division could occur if the stem cells are damaged by stress of some kind. This paper describes a mechanism that clears stress-damaged stem cells from the blood. John Dick and colleagues show that haematopoietic stem cells are predisposed to endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-mediated apoptosis when compared to early progenitors. The blood system is sustained by a pool of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are long-lived due to their capacity for self-renewal. A consequence of longevity is exposure to stress stimuli including reactive oxygen species (ROS), nutrient fluctuation and DNA damage1,2. Damage that occurs within stressed HSCs must be tightly controlled to prevent either loss of function or the clonal persistence of oncogenic mutations that increase the risk of leukaemogenesis3,4. Despite the importance of maintaining cell integrity throughout life, how the HSC pool achieves this and how individual HSCs respond to stress remain poorly understood. Many sources of stress cause misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) enables the cell to either resolve stress or initiate apoptosis5,6. Here we show that human HSCs are predisposed to apoptosis through strong activation of the PERK branch of the UPR after ER stress, whereas closely related progenitors exhibit an adaptive response leading to their survival. Enhanced ER protein folding by overexpression of the co-chaperone ERDJ4 (also called DNAJB9) increases HSC repopulation capacity in xenograft assays, linking the UPR to HSC function. Because the UPR is a focal point where different sources of stress converge, our study provides a framework for understanding how stress signalling is coordinated within tissue hierarchies and integrated with stemness. Broadly, these findings reveal that the HSC pool maintains clonal integrity by clearance of individual HSCs after stress to prevent propagation of damaged stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W2085278634,"N(6)-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal RNA modification in eukaryotes. ALKBH5 belongs to the AlkB family of dioxygenases and has been shown to specifically demethylate m(6)A in single-stranded RNA. Here we report crystal structures of ALKBH5 in the presence of either its cofactors or the ALKBH5 inhibitor citrate. Catalytic assays demonstrate that the ALKBH5 catalytic domain can demethylate both single-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA. We identify the TCA cycle intermediate citrate as a modest inhibitor of ALKHB5 (IC50, ∼488 μm). The structural analysis reveals that a loop region of ALKBH5 is immobilized by a disulfide bond that apparently excludes the binding of dsDNA to ALKBH5. We identify the m(6)A binding pocket of ALKBH5 and the key residues involved in m(6)A recognition using mutagenesis and ITC binding experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2117672162,"Specific chemicals can prime the plant immune system for augmented defense. β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) is a priming agent that provides broad-spectrum disease protection. However, BABA also suppresses plant growth when applied in high doses, which has hampered its application as a crop defense activator. Here we describe a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that is impaired in BABA-induced disease immunity (ibi1) but is hypersensitive to BABA-induced growth repression. IBI1 encodes an aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. Enantiomer-specific binding of the R enantiomer of BABA to IBI1 primed the protein for noncanonical defense signaling in the cytoplasm after pathogen attack. This priming was associated with aspartic acid accumulation and tRNA-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α. However, mutation of eIF2α-phosphorylating GCN2 kinase did not affect BABA-induced immunity but relieved BABA-induced growth repression. Hence, BABA-activated IBI1 controls plant immunity and growth via separate pathways. Our results open new opportunities to separate broad-spectrum disease resistance from the associated costs on plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2109541017,"Direct evidence for the role of BRCA1 in controlling homologous recombination at stalled replication forks has been obtained in mammalian cells using the bacterial Tus/Ter system. The stalling of a replication fork can initiate pathological events that lead to cancer. While it has been proposed that the tumour suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2 might regulate homologous recombination (HR) at stalled replication forks, it has not been possible to obtain direct evidence for this in mammalian cells due to the absence of an experimental system in which to test it. Ralph Scully and colleagues have now developed a system that allows engineering of a specific stalled fork in mammalian cells. The bacterial Tus/Ter complex is able to cause bidirectional stalling of a fork, which requires BRCA1/BRCA2-mediated HR for its recovery. However, aberrant long-tract HR is found to occur at stalled forks in the absence of BRCA proteins, suggesting a basis for the cancer predisposition in these cells. Replication fork stalling can promote genomic instability, predisposing to cancer and other diseases1,2,3. Stalled replication forks may be processed by sister chromatid recombination (SCR), generating error-free or error-prone homologous recombination (HR) outcomes4,5,6,7,8. In mammalian cells, a long-standing hypothesis proposes that the major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer predisposition gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2, control HR/SCR at stalled replication forks9. Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 affect replication fork processing10,11,12, direct evidence that BRCA gene products regulate homologous recombination at stalled chromosomal replication forks is lacking, due to a dearth of tools for studying this process. Here we report that the Escherichia coli Tus/Ter complex13,14,15,16 can be engineered to induce site-specific replication fork stalling and chromosomal HR/SCR in mouse cells. Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination entails processing of bidirectionally arrested forks. We find that the Brca1 carboxy (C)-terminal tandem BRCT repeat and regions of Brca1 encoded by exon 11—two Brca1 elements implicated in tumour suppression—control Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination. Inactivation of either Brca1 or Brca2 increases the absolute frequency of ‘long-tract’ gene conversions at Tus/Ter-stalled forks, an outcome not observed in response to a site-specific endonuclease-mediated chromosomal double-strand break. Therefore, homologous recombination at stalled forks is regulated differently from homologous recombination at double-strand breaks arising independently of a replication fork. We propose that aberrant long-tract homologous recombination at stalled replication forks contributes to genomic instability and breast/ovarian cancer predisposition in BRCA mutant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2016004553,"Cyclins B1 and B2 are frequently elevated in human cancers and are associated with tumour aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome; however, whether and how B-type cyclins drive tumorigenesis is unknown. Here we show that cyclin B1 and B2 transgenic mice are highly prone to tumours, including tumour types where B-type cyclins serve as prognosticators. Cyclins B1 and B2 both induce aneuploidy when overexpressed but through distinct mechanisms, with cyclin B1 inhibiting separase activation, leading to anaphase bridges, and cyclin B2 triggering aurora-A-mediated Plk1 hyperactivation, resulting in accelerated centrosome separation and lagging chromosomes. Complementary experiments revealed that cyclin B2 and p53 act antagonistically to control aurora-A-mediated centrosome splitting and accurate chromosome segregation in normal cells. These data demonstrate a causative link between B-type cyclin overexpression and tumour pathophysiology, and uncover previously unknown functions of cyclin B2 and p53 in centrosome separation that may be perturbed in many human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1987234864,"A total of 1844 patients with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), most of them were children of age 1–3-year-old, in Central China were hospitalized from 2011 to 2012. Among them, 422 were infected with coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), 334 were infected with enterovirus 71 (EV71), 38 were co-infected with EV71 and CVA16, and 35 were infected with other enteroviruses. Molecular epidemiology analysis revealed that EV71 and CVA16 were detected year-round, but EV71 circulated mainly in July and CVA16 circulated predominantly in November, and incidence of HFMD was reduced in January and February and increased in March. Clinical data showed that hyperglycemia and neurologic complications were significantly higher in EV71-infected patients, while upper respiratory tract infection and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in CVA16-associated patients. 124 EV71 and 80 CVA16 strains were isolated, among them 56 and 68 EV71 strains were C4a and C4b, while 25 and 55 CVA16 strains were B1a and B1b, respectively. Similarity plots and bootscan analyses based on entire genomic sequences revealed that the three C4a sub-genotype EV71 strains were recombinant with C4b sub-genotype EV71 in 2B–2C region, and the three CVA16 strains were recombinant with EV71 in 2A–2B region. Thus, CVA16 and EV71 were the major causative agents in a large HFMD outbreak in Central China. HFMD incidence was high for children among household contact and was detected year-round, but outbreak was seasonal dependent. CVA16 B1b and EV71 C4b reemerged and caused a large epidemic in China after a quiet period of many years. Moreover, EV71 and CVA16 were co-circulated during the outbreak, which may have contributed to the genomic recombination between the pathogens. It should gain more attention as there may be an upward trend in co-circulation of the two pathogens globally and the new role recombination plays in the emergence of new enterovirus variants."
https://openalex.org/W1985545549,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are most probably powered by collimated relativistic outflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. Bright afterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium. Afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet when measured minutes after the burst, and it probes the geometric properties of the jet and the ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. High values of optical polarization detected minutes after the burst of GRB 120308A indicate the presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the central engine (the power source of the GRB). Theoretical models predict low degrees of linear polarization and no circular polarization at late times, when the energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient medium and propagates farther into the medium as a blast wave. Here we report the detection of circularly polarized light in the afterglow of GRB 121024A, measured 0.15 days after the burst. We show that the circular polarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dust scattering or plasma propagation effects. A possible explanation is to invoke anisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch-angle distributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce the complex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets."
https://openalex.org/W2000939163,"The climate-active gas methane is generated both by biological processes and by thermogenic decomposition of fossil organic material, which forms methane and short-chain alkanes, principally ethane, propane and butane. In addition to natural sources, environments are exposed to anthropogenic inputs of all these gases from oil and gas extraction and distribution. The gases provide carbon and/or energy for a diverse range of microorganisms that can metabolize them in both anoxic and oxic zones. Aerobic methanotrophs, which can assimilate methane, have been considered to be entirely distinct from utilizers of short-chain alkanes, and studies of environments exposed to mixtures of methane and multi-carbon alkanes have assumed that disparate groups of microorganisms are responsible for the metabolism of these gases. Here we describe the mechanism by which a single bacterial strain, Methylocella silvestris, can use methane or propane as a carbon and energy source, documenting a methanotroph that can utilize a short-chain alkane as an alternative to methane. Furthermore, during growth on a mixture of these gases, efficient consumption of both gases occurred at the same time. Two soluble di-iron centre monooxygenase (SDIMO) gene clusters were identified and were found to be differentially expressed during bacterial growth on these gases, although both were required for efficient propane utilization. This report of a methanotroph expressing an additional SDIMO that seems to be uniquely involved in short-chain alkane metabolism suggests that such metabolic flexibility may be important in many environments where methane and short-chain alkanes co-occur."
https://openalex.org/W2142672231,"Sensory processing deficits are observed in individuals with Rett syndrome and MeCP2-deficient mice. Here, the authors show that it is the loss of MeCP2 specifically in forebrain inhibitory neurons that leads to deficits in auditory-evoked local field potentials and elicits the seizures observed in MeCP2-deficient mice. Dysfunction in sensory information processing is a hallmark of many neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and Rett syndrome (RTT). Using mouse models of RTT, a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, we found that the large-scale loss of MeCP2 from forebrain GABAergic interneurons led to deficits in auditory event-related potentials and seizure manifestation, whereas the restoration of MeCP2 in specific classes of interneurons ameliorated these deficits."
https://openalex.org/W1984723655,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a highly heterogeneous trait with sarcomeric gene mutations predominating. The cause of a substantial percentage of DCMs remains unknown, and no gene-specific therapy is available. On the basis of resequencing of 513 DCM cases and 1,150 matched controls from various cohorts of distinct ancestry, we discovered rare, functional RAF1 mutations in 3 of the cohorts (South Indian, North Indian and Japanese). The prevalence of RAF1 mutations was ~9% in childhood-onset DCM cases in these three cohorts. Biochemical studies showed that DCM-associated RAF1 mutants had altered kinase activity, resulting in largely unaltered ERK activation but in AKT that was hyperactivated in a BRAF-dependent manner. Constitutive expression of these mutants in zebrafish embryos resulted in a heart failure phenotype with AKT hyperactivation that was rescued by treatment with rapamycin. These findings provide new mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic targets for RAF1-associated DCM and further expand the clinical spectrum of RAF1-related human disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2055264482,"Flow back along a needle track (backflow) can be a problem during direct infusion, e.g. convection-enhanced delivery (CED), of drugs into soft tissues such as brain. In this study, the effect of needle insertion speed on local tissue injury and backflow was evaluated in vivo in the rat brain. Needles were introduced at three insertion speeds (0.2, 2, and 10 mm/s) followed by CED of Evans blue albumin (EBA) tracer. Holes left in tissue slices were used to reconstruct penetration damage. These measurements were also input into a hyperelastic model to estimate radial stress at the needle-tissue interface (pre-stress) before infusion. Fast insertion speeds were found to produce more tissue bleeding and disruption; average hole area at 10 mm/s was 1.87-fold the area at 0.2 mm/s. Hole measurements also differed at two fixation time points after needle retraction, 10 and 25 min, indicating that pre-stresses are influenced by time-dependent tissue swelling. Calculated pre-stresses were compressive (0 to 485 Pa) and varied along the length of the needle with smaller average values within white matter (116 Pa) than gray matter (301 Pa) regions. Average pre-stress at 0.2 mm/s (351.7 Pa) was calculated to be 1.46-fold the value at 10 mm/s. For CED backflow experiments (0.5, 1, and 2 µL/min), measured EBA backflow increased as much as 2.46-fold between 10 and 0.2 mm/s insertion speeds. Thus, insertion rate-dependent damage and changes in pre-stress were found to directly contribute to the extent of backflow, with slower insertion resulting in less damage and improved targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1987210971,"The trafficking kinetics of Glut4, the transferrin (Tf) receptor, and LRP1 were quantified in adipocytes and undifferentiated fibroblasts. Six steps were identified that determine steady state cell surface Glut4: (i) endocytosis, (ii) degradation, (iii) sorting, (iv) sequestration, (v) release, and (vi) tethering/docking/fusion. Endocytosis of Glut4 is 3 times slower than the Tf receptor in fibroblasts (ken = 0.2 min(-1) versus 0.6 min(-1)). Differentiation decreases Glut4 ken 40% (ken = 0.12 min(-1)). Differentiation also decreases Glut4 degradation, increasing total and cell surface Glut4 3-fold. In fibroblasts, Glut4 is recycled from endosomes through a slow constitutive pathway (kex = 0.025-0.038 min(-1)), not through the fast Tf receptor pathway (kex = 0.2 min(-1)). The kex measured in adipocytes after insulin stimulation is similar (kex = 0.027 min(-1)). Differentiation decreases the rate constant for sorting into the Glut4 recycling pathway (ksort) 3-fold. In adipocytes, Glut4 is also sorted from endosomes into a second exocytic pathway through Glut4 storage vesicles (GSVs). Surprisingly, transfer from endosomes into GSVs is highly regulated; insulin increases the rate constant for sequestration (kseq) 8-fold. Release from sequestration in GSVs is rate-limiting for Glut4 exocytosis in basal adipocytes. AS160 regulates this step. Tethering/docking/fusion of GSVs to the plasma membrane is regulated through an AS160-independent process. Insulin increases the rate of release and fusion of GSVs (kfuseG) 40-fold. LRP1 cycles with the Tf receptor and Glut4 in fibroblasts but predominantly with Glut4 after differentiation. Surprisingly, AS160 knockdown accelerated LRP1 exocytosis in basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes. These data indicate that AS160 may regulate trafficking into as well as release from GSVs."
https://openalex.org/W1977991437,"cAMP mediates autonomic regulation of heart rate by means of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which underlie the pacemaker current If. cAMP binding to the C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding domain enhances HCN open probability through a conformational change that reaches the pore via the C-linker. Using structural and functional analysis, we identified a binding pocket in the C-linker of HCN4. Cyclic dinucleotides, an emerging class of second messengers in mammals, bind the C-linker pocket (CLP) and antagonize cAMP regulation of the channel. Accordingly, cyclic dinucleotides prevent cAMP regulation of If in sinoatrial node myocytes, reducing heart rate by 30%. Occupancy of the CLP hence constitutes an efficient mechanism to hinder β-adrenergic stimulation on If. Our results highlight the regulative role of the C-linker and identify a potential drug target in HCN4. Furthermore, these data extend the signaling scope of cyclic dinucleotides in mammals beyond their first reported role in innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2041647010,"FBXL5 (F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 5) is the F-box protein subunit of, and therefore responsible for substrate recognition by, the SCF(FBXL5) ubiquitin-ligase complex, which targets iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) for proteasomal degradation. IRP2 plays a central role in the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis in mammals through posttranscriptional regulation of proteins that contribute to control of the intracellular iron concentration. The FBXL5-IRP2 axis is integral to control of iron metabolism in vivo, given that mice lacking FBXL5 die during early embryogenesis as a result of unrestrained IRP2 activity and oxidative stress attributable to excessive iron accumulation. Despite its pivotal role in the control of iron homeostasis, however, little is known of the upstream regulation of FBXL5 activity. We now show that FBXL5 undergoes constitutive ubiquitin-dependent degradation at the steady state. With the use of a proteomics approach to the discovery of proteins that regulate the stability of FBXL5, we identified the large HECT-type ubiquitin ligase HERC2 (HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2) as an FBXL5-associated protein. Inhibition of the HERC2-FBXL5 interaction or depletion of endogenous HERC2 by RNA interference resulted in the stabilization of FBXL5 and a consequent increase in its abundance. Such accumulation of FBXL5 in turn led to a decrease in the intracellular content of ferrous iron. Our results thus suggest that HERC2 regulates the basal turnover of FBXL5, and that this ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway contributes to the control of mammalian iron metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2046348173,"Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is one of the most damaging cereal diseases in semi-arid regions worldwide. The genetics of FCR resistance in the bread wheat (Triticum eastivum L.) variety EGA Wylie, the most resistant commercial variety available, was studied by QTL mapping. Three populations of recombinant inbred lines were developed with this elite variety as the resistant parent. Four QTL conferring FCR resistance were detected and resistance alleles of all of them were derived from the resistant parent EGA Wylie. One of these loci was located on the short arm of chromosome 5D (designated as Qcrs.cpi-5D). This QTL explains up to 31.1% of the phenotypic variance with an LOD value of 9.6. The second locus was located on the long arm of chromosome 2D (designated as Qcrs.cpi-2D) and explained up to 20.2% of the phenotypic variance with an LOD value of 4.5. Significant effects of both Qcrs.cpi-5D and Qcrs.cpi-2D were detected in each of the three populations assessed. Another two QTL (designated as Qcrs.cpi-4B.1 and Qcrs.cpi-4B.2, respectively) were located on the short arm of chromosome 4B. These two QTL explained up to 16.9% and 18.8% of phenotypic variance, respectively. However, significant effects of Qcrs.cpi-4B.1 and Qcrs.cpi-4B.2 were not detected when the effects of plant height was accounted for by covariance analysis. The elite characteristics of this commercial variety should facilitate the incorporation of the resistance loci it contains into breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2058719296,"Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is an eye disease that can cause retinal detachment and even lead to blindness. RNV mainly occurs in the elderly population. The pathogenesis of RNV has been previously reported to be highly related to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and other angiogenic factors. It has also been reported that VEGFA and other factors associated with RNV could be regulated by certain microRNAs (miRNA), a group of small non-coding RNAs which are able to regulate the expression of many genes in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that the miRNA miR-410 is highly expressed in mice within two weeks after birth. miR-410 could suppress VEGFA expression through interaction with the 3'UTR of the VEGFA messenger RNA. Overexpressing a miR-410 mimic effectively suppresses VEGFA expression in various cell lines. Further experiments on oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in mice revealed that eye drops containing large amounts of miR-410 efficiently downregulate VEGFA expression, prevent retinal angiogenesis and effectively treat RNV. These results not only show the underlying mechanism of how miR-410 targets VEGFA but also provide a potential treatment strategy for RNV that might be used in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2091586410,"Secretoglobin family 1A member 1 (SCGB 1A1) is a small protein mainly secreted by mucosal epithelial cells of the lungs and uterus. SCGB 1A1, also known as club (Clara) cell secretory protein, represents a major constituent of airway surface fluid. The protein has anti-inflammatory properties, and its concentration is reduced in equine recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) and human asthma. RAO is characterized by reversible airway obstruction, bronchoconstriction and neutrophilic inflammation. Direct effects of SCGB 1A1 on neutrophil functions are unknown. We have recently identified that the SCGB1A1 gene is triplicated in equids and gives rise to two distinct proteins. In this study we produced the endogenously expressed forms of SCGBs (SCGB 1A1 and 1A1A) as recombinant proteins, and analyzed their effects on reactive oxygen species production, phagocytosis, chemotaxis and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation ex vivo. We further evaluated whether NETs are present in vivo in control and inflamed lungs. Our data show that SCGB 1A1A but not SCGB 1A1 increase neutrophil oxidative burst and phagocytosis; and that both proteins markedly reduce neutrophil chemotaxis. SCGB 1A1A reduced chemotaxis significantly more than SCGB 1A1. NET formation was significantly reduced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by SCGB 1A1 and 1A1A. SCGB mRNA in bronchial biopsies, and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, was lower in horses with RAO. NETs were present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from horses with exacerbated RAO, but not in fluid from horses with RAO in remission or in challenged healthy horses. These findings indicate that SCGB 1A1 and 1A1A have overlapping and diverging functions. Considering disparities in the relative abundance of SCGB 1A1 and 1A1A in airway secretions of animals with RAO suggests that these functional differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of RAO and other neutrophilic inflammatory lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2042811087,"Gossypol is a putative BH3 mimetic proposed to inhibit BCL2 and BCLXL based on cell-free assays. We demonstrated previously that gossypol failed to directly inhibit BCL2 in cells or induce apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells or platelets, which require BCL2 or BCLXL, respectively, for survival. Here, we demonstrate that gossypol rapidly increased activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which led to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and up-regulation of the BH3-only protein NOXA. Pretreatment with the PLA2 inhibitor, aristolochic acid, abrogated the increase in calcium, ER stress, and NOXA. Calcium chelation also abrogated the gossypol-induced increase in calcium, ER stress, and NOXA, but not the increase in PLA2 activity, indicating that PLA2 is upstream of these events. In addition, incubating cells with the two products of PLA2 (lysophosphatidic acid and arachidonic acid) mimicked treatment with gossypol. NOXA is a pro-apoptotic protein that functions by binding the BCL2 family proteins MCL1 and BFL1. The BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199 is currently in clinical trials for CLL. Resistance to ABT-199 can occur from up-regulation of other BCL2 family proteins, and this resistance can be mimicked by culturing CLL cells on CD154(+) stroma cells. We report here that AT-101, a derivative of gossypol in clinical trials, overcomes stroma-mediated resistance to ABT-199 in primary CLL cells, suggesting that a combination of these drugs may be efficacious in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2045306333,"Neuronal exocytosis is mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. Before fusion, SNARE proteins form complexes bridging the membrane followed by assembly toward the C-terminal membrane anchors, thus initiating membrane fusion. After fusion, the SNARE complex is disassembled by the AAA-ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor that requires the cofactor α-SNAP to first bind to the assembled SNARE complex. Using chromaffin granules and liposomes we now show that α-SNAP on its own interferes with the zippering of membrane-anchored SNARE complexes midway through the zippering reaction, arresting SNAREs in a partially assembled trans-complex and preventing fusion. Intriguingly, the interference does not result in an inhibitory effect on synaptic vesicles, suggesting that membrane properties also influence the final outcome of α-SNAP interference with SNARE zippering. We suggest that binding of α-SNAP to the SNARE complex affects the ability of the SNARE complex to harness energy or transmit force to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2069666308,"Past event-related potentials (ERPs) research shows that, after exerting effortful emotion inhibition, the neural correlates of performance monitoring (e.g. error-related negativity) were weakened. An undetermined issue is whether all forms of emotion regulation uniformly impair later performance monitoring. The present study compared the cognitive consequences of two emotion regulation strategies, namely suppression and reappraisal. Participants were instructed to suppress their emotions while watching a sad movie, or to adopt a neutral and objective attitude toward the movie, or to just watch the movie carefully. Then after a mood scale, all participants completed an ostensibly unrelated Stroop task, during which ERPs (i.e. error-related negativity (ERN), post-error positivity (Pe) and N450) were obtained. Reappraisal group successfully decreased their sad emotion, relative to the other two groups. Compared with participants in the control group and the reappraisal group, those who suppressed their emotions during the sad movie showed reduced ERN after error commission. Participants in the suppression group also made more errors in incongruent Stroop trials than the other two groups. There were no significant main effects or interactions of group for reaction time, Pe and N450. Results suggest that reappraisal is both more effective and less resource-depleting than suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1981149142,"Big or high conductance potassium (BK) channels are activated by voltage and intracellular calcium (Ca2+). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a ubiquitous modulator of ion channel activity, has been reported to enhance Ca2+-driven gating of BK channels, but a molecular understanding of this interplay or even of the PIP2 regulation of this channel's activity remains elusive. Here, we identify structural determinants in the KDRDD loop (which follows the αA helix in the RCK1 domain) to be responsible for the coupling between Ca2+ and PIP2 in regulating BK channel activity. In the absence of Ca2+, RCK1 structural elements limit channel activation through a decrease in the channel's PIP2 apparent affinity. This inhibitory influence of BK channel activation can be relieved by mutation of residues that (a) connect either the RCK1 Ca2+ coordination site (Asp367 or its flanking basic residues in the KDRDD loop) to the PIP2-interacting residues (Lys392 and Arg393) found in the αB helix or (b) are involved in hydrophobic interactions between the αA and αB helix of the RCK1 domain. In the presence of Ca2+, the RCK1-inhibitory influence of channel-PIP2 interactions and channel activity is relieved by Ca2+ engaging Asp367. Our results demonstrate that, along with Ca2+ and voltage, PIP2 is a third factor critical to the integral control of BK channel activity. Big or high conductance potassium (BK) channels are activated by voltage and intracellular calcium (Ca2+). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a ubiquitous modulator of ion channel activity, has been reported to enhance Ca2+-driven gating of BK channels, but a molecular understanding of this interplay or even of the PIP2 regulation of this channel's activity remains elusive.

Our results demonstrate that, along with Ca2+ and voltage, PIP2 is a third factor critical to the integral control of BK channel activity. The high conductance potassium (Maxi K, Big K, or BK) channel is activated by both membrane depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). Although Ca2+ and voltage are thought to act independently to regulate channel opening, a weak allosteric interaction between them makes the voltage sensor movement much more effective (1Cui J.

The Slo1 pore-forming subunits of BK channels are composed of seven transmembrane segments (S0–S6) that assemble into tetramers.

BK channel activation: structural and functional insights.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The first Ca2+-binding site identified was in a region termed the Ca2+-bowl that contains a series of Asp residues located in the RCK2 domain (6Schreiber M. Salkoff L. A novel calcium-sensing domain in the BK channel.Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 1, B, C (left), and D (bottom)). The second Ca2+-binding site was identified in the RCK1 domain at position Asp367 (Fig. 1, A and D (top), shows Asp367 in the KDRDD loop in yellow) (10Xia X.M. Zeng X. Lingle C.J. Multiple regulatory sites in large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.Nature. 2002; 418: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the side chain of Glu535 (Fig. 1C, right) was reported to be a part of the RCK1 Ca2+ coordination site together with Asp367 (31Zhang G. Huang S.Y. Yang J. Shi J. Yang X. Moller A.

High-resolution crystal structures of the cytosolic domain have been obtained either with the RCK2 Ca2+-bowl occupied by Ca2+ (PDB 3The abbreviations used are:PDBProtein Data BankPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate5D5ND897N/D901NWtmnwortmanninG-Vconductance-voltageAbantibodypoly-K+polylysine. code 3MT5) (32Yuan P.

Ca2+ has not yet been resolved in the RCK1 site, although the side chains of Asp367 and Glu535 are positioned such that they could coordinate Ca2+ (Fig. 1C, right, 3NAF structure). Interestingly, in the presence of Ca2+ in the Ca2+-bowl, Asp367 and Glu535 point away from each other, such that they could not possibly coordinate Ca2+ (Fig. 1C, left, 3MT5 structure). Despite these structural advances in the Ca2+-sensing cytosolic domains, the lack of a full-length structure that includes the transmembrane domains as well as the lack of the RCK1 Ca2+-bound state have precluded a structural understanding of how the channel is gated by either voltage or Ca2+ and how the weak allosteric coupling between these two gating mechanisms greatly enhances channel activation.FIGURE 6Asp367 and its flanking two basic residues exert an inhibitory effect on activation of Slo1 channels in the absence of [Ca2+]i.

The Ca2+ ion is shown in blue. A–H, normalized G-V curves for WT (A) and mutants (B–H) in 0 (open symbols) and 300 μm (filled symbols) [Ca2+]i. In the presence of 300 μm [Ca2+]i, the current traces for the G-V curves were obtained from voltage pulses with a 10-mV increment from −180 to +180 mV; the holding and repolarizing voltages were −120 mV. In the absence of [Ca2+]i, voltage was stepped from −100 to +300 mV, and the holding and repolarizing current was at −100 mV. For clarity, the currents shown in the insets are the traces elicited at −20, +40, +80, +120, and +160 mV in 300 μm [Ca2+]i or at 120, 160, 200, 240, and 280 mV in 0 [Ca2+]i. For easy comparison, the red-colored traces in the left set highlight the currents activated at +80 mV in 300 μm [Ca2+]i, and the cyan traces highlight the currents activated at −20 mV (near the V½ for Slo1-WT at 300 μm [Ca2+]i). The green-colored traces in the right set highlight the currents elicited at +200 mV. The solid lines are fits to the Boltzmann equation (see “Experimental Procedures”).

V½ is indicated by the red dashed lines (V½ = +173 mV in 0 μm [Ca2+]i and −8 mV in 100 μm [Ca2+]i). Voltage protocols for G-V curves are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Actual macroscopic current traces in 0 (right) and 100 μm [Ca2+]i (left) are shown in the insets. For clarity, current traces shown are in 40-mV increments, as indicated. The voltages before and after the pulses were −120 mV in 100 μm [Ca2+]i (left) and −100 mV in 0 μm [Ca2+]i (right), respectively. B, G-V curves at 0 Ca2+ for WT Slo1 channels in different PIP2 concentrations, as indicated. G-V curves at each PIP2 concentration were obtained following endogenous PIP2 depletion by PIP2 scavengers (PIP2 Ab (PIP2 Ab (1–2:1000) + poly-K+ (300 μg/ml)). The solid lines through the data points represent fits to a simple Boltzmann function. The red vertical line at +170 mV (near the V½ determined in A) is used as a reference point to assess relative amplitude of PIP2-elicited currents. Note that 300 μm PIP2 induced further activation when compared with 100 μm PIP2. C, same as in B but in 100 μm [Ca2+]i.

D, PIP2 dose-response curves for Slo1 WT channels near V½ at 170 mV in 0 [Ca2+]i (open symbols) and at −10 mV in 100 μm [Ca2+]i (filled symbols). The points in 0 Ca2+ were obtained from B (at 170 mV), and those at −10 mV at 100 μm Ca2+ are from C. Solid lines are fits to the Hill equation with an EC50 summarized in G. Note that the maximum values were obtained from fits to the Hill equation. Hill coefficients were 0.73 in 0 [Ca2+]i and 0.76 in 100 μm [Ca2+]i. E, same as in D but for D369G. Hill coefficients were 0.57 in 0 [Ca2+]i and 0.98 in 100 μm [Ca2+]i. F, same as in D but for D367G. Hill coefficients were 0.83 in 0 μm [Ca2+]i and 0.83 in 100 μm [Ca2+]i. Macroscopic current traces (in D–F) in different concentrations of PIP2 are shown on the left for 100 μm [Ca2+]i and on the right for 0 [Ca2+]i. Currents were elicited by depolarization to +100 mV in 100 μm [Ca2+]i (left) and by a step to +150 mV in 0 μm [Ca2+]i(right). The voltages before and after the pulses in 100 μm [Ca2+]i were −120 mV and −100 mV in 0 μm [Ca2+]i, respectively. Note that at the same voltage (such as at 100 mV in 100 μm [Ca2+]i, as shown on the left, or 150 mV in 0 [Ca2+]i, as shown on the right), both mutations D369G and D367G dramatically enhanced channel PIP2 apparent affinity.

Bukiya A. Liu J. Liu P. Asuncion-Chin M. Fan Z. Dopico A. Direct regulation of BK channels by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as a novel signaling pathway.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PIP2 was found to enhance Ca2+-driven gating by increasing mean open time and decreasing mean closed time kinetics. The PIP2-induced activation was also found to be potentiated by the β1 but not by the β4 accessory channel subunits. These PIP2 effects were found to be relevant in vascular myocytes, possibly contributing to the BK control of vascular tone. We set out to investigate the structural determinants of the Ca2+-dependent PIP2 regulation of Slo1α activity. We expressed the mSlo1α channel in Xenopus oocytes and mainly used inside-out macropatches to study regulation of its activity by PIP2. Increases in [Ca2+]i enhanced the apparent affinity for PIP2 through the Ca2+ coordination residue Asp367 in the KDRDD loop. Furthermore, in the absence of [Ca2+]i, it became clear that Asp367 as well as its two flanking basic residues, Lys366 and Arg368 (Fig. 1A), served to inhibit channel activation by decreasing the apparent affinity for PIP2. These results suggested that the KDRDD loop exerted an inhibitory effect on channel activation through PIP2. Mutagenesis results showed that this coupling proceeded from the KDRDD loop through the αA helix to the αB helix (Fig. 1D, top). PIP2 docking simulations with the two available crystal structures and mutagenesis identified two basic residues in the αB helix, Lys392 and Arg393, as critical elements in the coordination of PIP2 (Fig. 1C, right). These results suggest that PIP2 could serve in the role of allosterically coupling the cytosolic RCK1 structural elements (KDRDD loop, αA and αB helices) to the membrane-gating elements of the channel.

Currents were normally recorded within ∼2 weeks. Macroscopic currents were recorded from standard excised inside-out patches with an A-M 2400 patch clamp amplifier (A-M Systems, Inc.). pClamp (Molecular Devices) was used to drive stimulus protocols and digitize currents. The signals were low pass-filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 20-μs intervals. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KMES (methanesulfonate), 20 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. The composition of internal solution of 0 μm [Ca2+]i to bathe the cytoplasmic face of patch membranes contained 140 mm KMES, 20 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.0. The free [Ca2+] in nominal 0 μm [Ca2+]i solution was presumably about 0.5 nm. To obtain the conductance-voltage (G-V) curves in different [Ca2+]i, currents were elicited by voltage pulses from −180 to 200 mV (20 ms) at 10-mV increments, whereas the voltages before and after the pulses were held at −120 mV. In 0 [Ca2+]i, currents were elicited by voltage pulses from −100 to 300 mV or to 380 mV for some mutants (8 ms) at 10-mV increments, unless otherwise mentioned, whereas the voltages before and after these pulses were held at −100 mV. BK single-channel currents were recorded from oocytes under the standard inside-out patch configuration. The solutions in the pipette and bath were the same as used in macroscopic current recordings except that 2 mm MgCl2 and[Ca2+]i concentrations were changed as indicated. Activity rundown in different intracellular [Ca2+]i was measured 20–30 min following excision at the indicated voltage. 10 μm PIP2 was perfused from the intracellular side (bath solution), and its effect was measured 5 min later when the BK channel activity reached steady state. Preparation of different [Ca2+] solutions was as described previously (37Tang Q.Y. Zeng X.H. Lingle C.J. Closed-channel block of BK potassium channels by bbTBA requires partial activation.J. Gen. P"
https://openalex.org/W1976331650,"Background and Purpose Longitudinal functional imaging studies of stroke are key in identifying the disease progression and possible therapeutic interventions. Here we investigate the applicability of real-time functional optoacoustic imaging for monitoring of stroke progression in the whole brain of living animals. Materials and Methods The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to model stroke in mice, which were imaged preoperatively and the occlusion was kept in place for 60 minutes, after which optoacoustic scans were taken at several time points. Results Post ischemia an asymmetry of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain was observed as a region of hypoxia in the hemisphere affected by the ischemic event. Furthermore, we were able to visualize the penumbra in-vivo as a localized hemodynamically-compromised area adjacent to the region of stroke-induced perfusion deficit. Conclusion The intrinsic sensitivity of the new imaging approach to functional blood parameters, in combination with real time operation and high spatial resolution in deep living tissues, may see it become a valuable and unique tool in the development and monitoring of treatments aimed at suspending the spread of an infarct area."
https://openalex.org/W1983703254,"Cigarette smoking can harm fertility, but the existing research has targeted primarily on ovarian follicles, embryos or sex hormone. In this study, we tested cigarette smoke extract on ovulation, oocyte morphology and ovarian gene expression associated with inhibition of oxidative stress using C57BL/6 mice. Mice in the experimental group were administered a cigarette smoke extract (CSE) solution (2 mg/ml) orally daily, while the blank control group was given dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). A positive control group (menadione) was used that received an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg menadione in oil solution daily. We found that the CSE group manifested a reduced diameter of zona pellucida-free oocyte (ZP-free OD) and a morphologically misshapen first polar body (PB). Our results suggest that CSE exposure is associated with a shrink size and poor quality of oocytes. Quitting smoking is a wise choice to ensure good fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2105987140,"Background The clinical definition of severe dengue fever remains a challenge for researchers in hyperendemic areas like Brazil. The ability of the traditional (1997) as well as the revised (2009) World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case classification schemes to detect severe dengue cases was evaluated in 267 children admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed dengue. Principal Findings Using the traditional scheme, 28.5% of patients could not be assigned to any category, while the revised scheme categorized all patients. Intensive therapeutic interventions were used as the reference standard to evaluate the ability of both the traditional and revised schemes to detect severe dengue cases. Analyses of the classified cases (n = 183) demonstrated that the revised scheme had better sensitivity (86.8%, P<0.001), while the traditional scheme had better specificity (93.4%, P<0.001) for the detection of severe forms of dengue. Conclusions/Significance This improved sensitivity of the revised scheme allows for better case capture and increased ICU admission, which may aid pediatricians in avoiding deaths due to severe dengue among children, but, in turn, it may also result in the misclassification of the patients' condition as severe, reflected in the observed lower positive predictive value (61.6%, P<0.001) when compared with the traditional scheme (82.6%, P<0.001). The inclusion of unusual dengue manifestations in the revised scheme has not shifted the emphasis from the most important aspects of dengue disease and the major factors contributing to fatality in this study: shock with consequent organ dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1992661684,"Diverse fungi live all or part of their life cycle inside plants as asymptomatic endophytes. While endophytic fungi are increasingly recognized as significant components of plant fitness, it is unclear how they interact with plant cells; why they occur throughout the fungal kingdom; and why they are associated with most fungal lifestyles. Here we evaluate the diversity of endophytic fungi that are able to form novel protoplasts called mycosomes. We found that mycosomes cultured from plants and phylogenetically diverse endophytic fungi have common morphological characteristics, express similar developmental patterns, and can revert back to the free-living walled state. Observed with electron microscopy, mycosome ontogeny within Aureobasidium pullulans may involve two organelles: double membrane-bounded promycosome organelles (PMOs) that form mycosomes, and multivesicular bodies that may form plastid-infecting vesicles. Cultured mycosomes also contain a double membrane-bounded organelle, which may be homologous to the A. pullulans PMO. The mycosome PMO is often expressed as a vacuole-like organelle, which alternatively may contain a lipoid body or a starch grain. Mycosome reversion to walled cells occurs within the PMO, and by budding from lipid or starch-containing mycosomes. Mycosomes discovered in chicken egg yolk provided a plant-independent source for analysis: they formed typical protoplast stages, contained fungal ITS sequences and reverted to walled cells, suggesting mycosome symbiosis with animals as well as plants. Our results suggest that diverse endophytic fungi express a novel protoplast phase that can explain their hidden existence, lifestyle switching, and diversity within the plant kingdom. Importantly, our findings outline ""what, where, when and how"", opening the way for cell and organelle-specific tests using in situ DNA hybridization and fluorescent labels. We discuss developmental, ecological and evolutionary contexts that provide a robust framework for continued tests of the mycosome phase hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2051353110,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted in brief pulses from the hypothalamus and regulates follicle-stimulating hormone β-subunit (FSHβ) gene expression in pituitary gonadotropes in a frequency-sensitive manner. The mechanisms underlying its preferential and paradoxical induction of FSHβ by low frequency GnRH pulses are incompletely understood. Here, we identify growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) as a GnRH-suppressed autocrine inducer of FSHβ gene expression. GDF9 gene transcription and expression were preferentially decreased by high frequency GnRH pulses. GnRH regulation of GDF9 was concentration-dependent and involved ERK and PKA. GDF9 knockdown or immunoneutralization reduced FSHβ mRNA expression. Conversely, exogenous GDF9 induced FSHβ expression in immortalized gonadotropes and in mouse primary pituitary cells. GDF9 exposure increased FSH secretion in rat primary pituitary cells. GDF9 induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation, which was impeded by ALK5 knockdown and by activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptor inhibitor SB-505124, which also suppressed FSHβ expression. Smad2/3 knockdown indicated that FSHβ induction by GDF9 involved Smad2 and Smad3. FSHβ mRNA induction by GDF9 and GnRH was synergistic. We hypothesized that GDF9 contributes to a regulatory loop that tunes the GnRH frequency-response characteristics of the FSHβ gene. To test this, we determined the effects of GDF9 knockdown on FSHβ induction at different GnRH pulse frequencies using a parallel perifusion system. Reduction of GDF9 shifted the characteristic pattern of GnRH pulse frequency sensitivity. These results identify GDF9 as contributing to an incoherent feed-forward loop, comprising both intracellular and secreted components, that regulates FSHβ expression in response to activation of cell surface GnRH receptors.

Following release into the hypophyseal portal system in discrete pulses, GnRH complexes with its cell surface receptor on the anterior pituitary gonadotrope cells, where it stimulates the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH. The gonadotropins regulate gonadal function, including sex steroid hormone synthesis, follicular growth and ovulation. LH and FSH have a common α subunit (CGA) and a specific β subunit (LHβ or FSHβ). Changes in the frequency of GnRH pulse secretion occur at various stages of the reproductive cycle (1Marshall J.C. Kelch R.P. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone: role of pulsatile secretion in the regulation of reproduction.N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A high GnRH pulse frequency favors LH secretion during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, whereas a low GnRH pulse frequency contributes to increased FSH secretion in the late luteal phase (2Bédécarrats G.Y.

Unlike LH, which is stored and has a highly regulated secretion, FSH is largely constitutively secreted, and the major mechanism controlling its level is regulation of FSHβ gene expression (4Bernard D.J.

FSH regulation shows a remarkable pattern of GnRH frequency sensitivity. In mouse gonadotropes, FSHβ gene expression is preferentially increased by brief, low concentration pulses of GnRH every 2 h. Paradoxically, doubling the amount of GnRH stimulation by increasing the pulse frequency to one pulse/hour leads to lower levels of FSHβ mRNA (5Choi S.G. Jia J. Pfeffer R.L. Sealfon S.C.

Alterations of GnRH frequency patterns are associated with reproductive disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, and underlie the pharmacological treatment of gonadal hormone-dependent diseases, such as endometriosis and prostate cancer. Because of its biological and medical importance, the frequency system underlying gonadotropin regulation has been an area of study for decades, and several factors have been proposed to contribute to FSHβ frequency sensitivity (2Bédécarrats G.Y.

The components and network motifs underlying the paradoxical preferential induction of FSHβ by low frequency GnRH pulses are not well understood. Most studies of the signaling pathways connecting the cell surface GnRH receptor and the nuclear FSHβ gene have been directed at intracellular signaling components and transcriptional regulators. We recently identified inhibin α, a secreted extracellular autocrine factor, as contributing to FSHβ regulation in the gonadotrope (5Choi S.G. Jia J. Pfeffer R.L. Sealfon S.C.

This finding suggested that important regulatory network motifs might be constructed from intracellular pathways and extracellular secreted regulatory factors. The identification of novel secreted FSHβ regulators might help elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying frequency sensitivity. Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily that is expressed in primary pituitary cultures and gonadotrope cell lines (15Wang Y.

Pituitary cells were plated in 48-well tissue culture plates at 1.8 × 106cells/ml per well in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS that had been charcoal-stripped to remove endogenous steroids, particularly glucocorticoids, estrogens, and progesterone present in fetal serum.

Immediately after transfection, cells were seeded in a cell culture plate containing DMEM + 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Next, culture medium was replaced with serum free-DMEM, and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C for serum starvation. Cells were then stimulated with GnRH or GDF9, harvested by trypsinization, and pelleted by centrifugation.

Chem. 2012; 287: 21550-21560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we studied their effects on GDF9. Either GnRH or CTX exposure greatly reduced the expression of GDF9 mRNA in LβT2 gonadotrope cells (63 and 78%, respectively, compared with untreated cells at 10 h; Fig. 1A). Similarly, GnRH exposure resulted in a significant reduction in GDF9 mRNA in mouse primary pituitary cells (Fig. 1B). In LβT2 cells, GDF9 expression decreased monotonically with increasing duration of GnRH exposure (Fig. 1C). We next studied the response of GDF9 to different frequencies of GnRH receptor stimulation. High pulse GnRH frequency resulted in a marked decrease in GDF9 expression, whereas low pulse frequency did not significantly alter GDF9 mRNA levels (Fig. 1D). Notably, FSHβ gene expression was most stimulated at low GnRH pulse frequency and was not significantly regulated by high GnRH pulse frequency (Fig. 1D). Hence, both GDF9 and FSHβ mRNAs show lower levels of expression at higher pulse frequency GnRH exposure. We sought to investigate further the mechanisms involved in GDF9 gene response to GnRH stimulation in LβT2 cells. Only high GnRH pulse frequency caused a decrease in GDF9 mRNA expression. The average GnRH concentration is proportional to frequency; thus, an increase in frequency increases the average GnRH concentration. Therefore, we next determined the concentration response of GDF9 suppression by GnRH. We found that GDF9 mRNA reduction by GnRH showed a marked concentration dependence, with the IC50 ∼ 0.1 nm GnRH and the maximal effect achieved at 1 nm GnRH (Fig. 1E). These results are consistent with the preferential suppression of GDF9 at high frequency GnRH stimulation resulting from the higher average GnRH concentration caused by this exposure. To identify the signaling pathways involved in GDF9 gene regulation by GnRH, GnRH-stimulated cells were pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors of various kinases, i.e. JNK, p38, Src, PKA, and ERK. The suppressive effects of GnRH on GDF9 mRNA expression were completely abolished by ERK inhibition and partially eliminated by PKA inhibition (Fig. 1F). All other inhibitors either had no significant effects (JNK inhibitor) or they affected basal GDF9 mRNA expression (p38 and Src inhibitors). Overall, these data indicate that the frequency effect of GnRH on GDF9 mRNA expression likely reflects a concentration effect and that the GnRH inhibitory effect on GDF9 is significantly dependent on ERK and PKA pathways. The involvement of PKA in mediating GDF9 mRNA suppression by GnRH is consistent with the inhibitory effect of CTX on GDF9 expression (see Fig. 1A). We investigated whether GnRH regulated GDF9 mRNA via transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms. To determine the influence of GnRH exposure on GDF9 transcription rate, we established an assay for GDF9 primary transcript levels using qPCR to measure sequence-confirmed exon-intron junction expression. GnRH decreased both GDF9 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A) and GDF9 primary transcript concentrations (Fig. 2B). As a control experiment, we showed that both CGA mRNA (Fig. 2A) and CGA primary transcript (Fig. 2B) were increased by GnRH stimulation. Thus, these data provide evidence that sustained GnRH exposure suppresses GDF9 gene transcription. We then assessed whether GnRH affected the stability of GDF9 transcripts. New mRNA transcription was inhibited by actinomycin D in cells stimulated with GnRH. We verified the effectiveness of actinomycin D on the induction of the immediate early gene c-jun by GnRH. As shown in Fig. 2C, actinomycin D treatment completely abolished the induction of c-jun mRNA. We measured the decay of GDF9 mRNA over time following the addition of actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 2D, the half-life of GDF9 mRNA (1.6 ± 0.3 h) was not significantly altered by GnRH (1.4 ± 0.1 h). Thus, GnRH suppressed GDF9 transcription but did not alter the stability of GDF9 mRNA. We studied the effect of GDF9 on FSHβ gene expression by siRNA-mediated knockdown. GDF9 protein levels were reduced by 50% by GDF9 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this, GDF9 transcript levels were reduced by ∼66% compared with scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). GDF9 knockdown led to a significant attenuation of both basal and GnRH-induced FSHβ mRNA expression (49 and 43%, respectively; Fig. 3C). In contrast, LHβ gene expression was unaffected. To evaluate whether this effect was mediated by secreted GDF9, we examined the influence of an extracellular anti-GDF9 antibody on FSHβ mRNA expression. GDF9-specific antibodies significantly decreased both basal and GnRH-induced FSHβ expression (Fig. 3D), whereas LHβ expression remained unchanged. Hence, these data indicate that locally secreted GDF9 may contribute to both basal and GnRH-stimulated FSHβ mRNA expression. We studied whether exogenous GDF9 protein altered FSHβ mRNA expression. In LβT2 cells, we observed a significant concentration-dependent induction of FSHβ mRNA by GDF9 protein (Fig. 4A). FSHβ mRNA induction by exogenous GDF9 was significantly reduced in the presence of GDF9-specific antibodies (Fig. 4B), thus confirming the role of extracellular GDF9. In contrast, LHβ mRNA was unaffected by GDF9 exposure or by the presence of GDF9 antibody. Additionally, GDF9 increased basal FSHβ expression and enhanced GnRH-induced FSHβ expression, thus showing a synergy between GnRH and GDF9 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, GDF9 had no effect on LHβ mRNA expression. This result validated the specificity of GDF9 for regulation of the FSHβ gene. To establish a physiological function for GDF9, we studied the impact of exogenous GDF9 on FSHβ expression in primary pituitary cultures of both mouse and rat origins. Treatment with GDF9 stimulated FSHβ but not LHβ mRNA expression in mouse primary pituitary cells (Fig. 4D). Additionally, we analyzed the effect of GDF9 treatment on FSH protein secretion using primary pituitary cultures from ovariectomized rats. The stimulatory effect of activin on FSH secretion was used as a positive control. Both GDF9 and activin stimulated FSH protein secretion in primary pituitary cells (Fig. 4E). Altogether, our results support a physiological role for GDF9 as a positive autocrine regulator of FSHβ. We subsequently studied the mechanism by which GDF9 regulated FSHβ mRNA. Whereas GDF9 signaling is mediated by ALK5 receptor and downstream Smad2 and Smad3 proteins in cultured ovarian granulosa cells (21Mazerbourg S. Klein C. Roh J. Kaivo-Oja N. Mottershead D.G. Korchynskyi O. Ritvos O. Hsueh A.J. Growth differentiation factor-9 signaling is mediated by the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase 5.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), it appears to be mediated by ALK4/7 in vivo in the mouse ovary (22Li Q. Agno J.E. Edson M.A. Nagaraja A.K. Nagashima T. Matzuk M.M. Transforming growth factor β receptor type 1 is essential for female reproductive tract integrity and function.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We investigated the involvement of ALK and Smad2/3 in the stimulatory effect of GDF9 on FSHβ mRNA expression in LβT2 gonadotrope cells. The specific ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB-505124 abolished GDF9 induction of FSHβ expression (Fig. 5A). In contrast, LHβ mRNA was unaffected. To determine which ALK subtype was most likely involved in this response, we interrogated LβT2 microarray datasets as well as a high sensitivity deep sequencing RNA-Seq dataset (4 samples with 30,000,000 reads/sample (20Wang Q. Chikina M. Zaslavsky E. Pincas H. Sealfon S.C. β-Catenin regulates GnRH-induced FSHβ gene expression.Mol. Endocrinol. 2013; 27: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). ALK5 mRNA showed elevated expression levels in the microarray experiment, whereas ALK4 and 7 transcript levels were at the limits of detection (Fig. 5B). The RNA-Seq data were similar, with ALK5 expression being high and very low levels of ALK4 transcript also present (Fig. 5B). GDF9 exposure was found to increase phospho-Smad2/3 protein levels by 2.7-fold, whereas total Smad2/3 protein levels remained unchanged. The stimulatory effect of GDF9 on Smad2/3 phosphorylation was blocked by ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB-505124 (Fig. 5C). Further, siRNA-mediated inactivation of ALK5, which showed a knockdown efficiency of 55% (Fig. 5D), significantly reduced the GDF9 stimulatory effect on Smad2/3 phosphorylation (by 37%; Fig. 5E) but not significantly affecting total Smad2/3 protein levels. Altogether, these data indicate that in gonadotrope cells, GDF9 most likely activates Smad2/3 phosphorylation via ALK5. We next tested the effect of Smad2/3 knockdown on GDF9 regulation of FSHβ gene expression. LβT2 cells were transfected with siRNA for Smad2, Smad3, or both and then exposed to GDF9. As shown in Fig. 5, F and G, Smad2 and Smad3 siRNAs were specific for their respective targets. Knockdown efficiency at the mRNA level was 60% for Smad2 and 67% for Smad3 (Fig. 5F)."

In this study, the novel transcriptional mechanism by which carrageenan and decline in ARSB increase Wnt9A expression in NCM460 and HT-29 human colonic epithelial cells and in mouse colon is presented. Increased expression of Wnt9A has been associated with multiple malignancies, including colon carcinoma, and with ectodermal and mesoendodermal morphogenesis. When ARSB activity was reduced by siRNA or by exposure to carrageenan (1 μg/ml for 24 h), degradation of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) was inhibited, leading to accumulation of more highly sulfated C4S, which binds less galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding protein. Nuclear galectin-3 increased and mediated increased binding of Sp1 to the Sp1 consensus sequence in the Wnt9A promoter, shown by oligonucleotide-binding assay and by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. When galectin-3 was silenced, the increases in Sp1 binding to the Wnt9A promoter and in Wnt9A expression, which followed carrageenan or ARSB silencing, were inhibited. Mithramycin A, a specific inhibitor of Sp1 oligonucleotide binding, and Sp1 siRNA blocked the carrageenan- and ARSB siRNA-induced increases in Wnt9A expression. These studies reveal how carrageenan exposure can lead to transcriptional events in colonic epithelial cells through decline in arylsulfatase B activity, with subsequent impact on C4S, galectin-3, Sp1, and Wnt9A and can exert significant effects on Wnt-initiated signaling and related vital cell processes.

https://openalex.org/W2131978565,"We examined the age and growth of Urotrygon rogersi on the Colombian coast of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean by directly estimating age using vertebral centra. We verified annual deposition of growth increments with marginal increment analysis. Eight growth curves were fitted to four data sets defined on the basis of the reproductive cycle (unadjusted or adjusted for age at first band) and size variables (disc width or total length). Model performance was evaluated using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), AIC weights and multi-model inference criteria. A two-phase growth function with adjusted age provided the best description of growth for females (based on five parameters, DW∞ = 20.1 cm, k = 0.22 yr–1) and males (based on four and five parameters, DW∞ = 15.5 cm, k = 0.65 yr–1). Median maturity of female and male U. rogersi is reached very fast (mean ± SE = 1.0 ± 0.1 year). This is the first age and growth study for a species of the genus Urotrygon and results indicate that U. rogersi attains a smaller maximum size and has a shorter lifespan and lower median age at maturity than species of closely related genera. These life history traits are in contrast with those typically reported for other elasmobranchs."
https://openalex.org/W2114639504,"The effects of 17-β-estradiol in osteoblasts are primarily mediated by the nuclear transcription factors, estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ. ERs function through three general modes of action: DNA-binding dependent through estrogen response elements (EREs; designated nuclear ERE signaling); nuclear signaling via protein-protein interactions to other transcription factors (nuclear non-ERE signaling); and extra-nuclear signaling (membrane-bound functions of ERs). Identification of the specific transcriptional signatures regulated by each of these modes of action should contribute to an enhanced understanding of estrogen signaling in osteoblasts. To achieve this goal, we utilized specific mutations of ERα that eliminate the ability of the receptor to signal through a specific mode of action. The non-classical ERα knock-in (NERKI) mutation is incapable of signaling through direct DNA binding to EREs and the nuclear only ERα (NOER) mutation eliminates all membrane-localized signaling. Comparison of the gene expression patterns elicited by these mutations with the wild-type ERα (WT) pattern provides mode-specific data concerning transcriptional regulation by ERα. We expressed these constructs in the ER-negative osteoblastic cell line hFOB (-/+ estrogen) and performed global RNA-sequencing. Using a series of pair-wise comparisons, we generated three lists of genes that were regulated either by the nuclear ERE-dependent, nuclear ERE-independent, or extra-nuclear actions of ERα. Pathway and gene ontology analyses revealed that genes regulated through the nuclear ERE and nuclear non-ERE pathways were largely involved in transcriptional regulation, whereas genes regulated through extra-nuclear mechanisms are involved in cytoplasmic signaling transduction pathways. We also intersected our data with genes linked to bone density and fractures from a recent genome-wide association study and found 25 of 72 genes (35%) regulated by estrogen. These data provide a comprehensive list of genes and pathways targeted by these specific modes of ERα action and suggest that ""mode-specific"" ligands could be developed to modulate specific ERα functionality in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2073056952,"Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a powerful and reproducible method of gene expression analysis in which expression levels are quantified by normalization against reference genes. Therefore, to investigate the potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for epithelial ovarian cancer by qPCR, it is critical to identify stable reference genes. In this study, twelve housekeeping genes (ACTB, GAPDH, 18S rRNA, GUSB, PPIA, PBGD, PUM1, TBP, HRPT1, RPLP0, RPL13A, and B2M) were analyzed in 50 ovarian samples from normal, benign, borderline, and malignant tissues. For reliable results, laser microdissection (LMD), an effective technique used to prepare homogeneous starting material, was utilized to precisely excise target tissues or cells. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and nonparametric (Kruskal-Wallis) tests were used to compare the expression differences. NormFinder and geNorm software were employed to further validate the suitability and stability of the candidate genes. Results showed that epithelial cells occupied a small percentage of the normal ovary indeed. The expression of ACTB, PPIA, RPL13A, RPLP0, and TBP were stable independent of the disease progression. In addition, NormFinder and geNorm identified the most stable combination (ACTB, PPIA, RPLP0, and TBP) and the relatively unstable reference gene GAPDH from the twelve commonly used housekeeping genes. Our results highlight the use of homogeneous ovarian tissues and multiple-reference normalization strategy, e.g. the combination of ACTB, PPIA, RPLP0, and TBP, for qPCR in epithelial ovarian tissues, whereas GAPDH, the most commonly used reference gene, is not recommended, especially as a single reference gene."

On-going, sustained local transmission resulted in an estimated 500,000 infected persons. We conducted a mixed method analysis using both quantitative (surveillance) and qualitative (interview) data; surveillance data was used to analyze demographic distribution of hospitalized cases and follow-up interview data was used to assess health seeking behavior. Invitations to participate in a telephone interview were sent to 120 randomly selected Illinois residents that were hospitalized during April–December 2009. During April–December 2009, 2,824 pH1N1 hospitalizations occurred in Illinois hospitals; median age (interquartile range) at admission was 24 (range: 6–49) years. Hospitalization rates/100,000 persons for blacks and Hispanics, regardless of age or sex were 2–3 times greater than for whites (blacks, 36/100,000 (95% Confidence Interval ([95% CI], 33–39)); Hispanics, 35/100,000 [95%CI,32–37] (; whites, 13/100,000[95%CI, 12–14); p<0.001). Mortality rates were higher for blacks (0.9/100,000; p<0.09) and Hispanics (1/100,000; p<0.04) when compared with the mortality rates for whites (0.6/100,000). Of 33 interview respondents, 31 (94%) stated that they had heard of pH1N1 before being hospitalized, and 24 (73%) did not believed they were at risk for pH1N1. On average, respondents reported experiencing symptoms for 2 days (range: 1–7) before seeking medical care. When asked how to prevent pH1N1 infection in the future, the most common responses were getting vaccinated and practicing hand hygiene. Blacks and Hispanics in Illinois experienced disproportionate pH1N1 hospitalization and mortality rates.

https://openalex.org/W1991307062,"The Cdk8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8) module of Mediator integrates regulatory cues from transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. It consists of four subunits where Med12 and Med13 link Cdk8 and cyclin C (CycC) to core Mediator. Here we have investigated the contributions of the Cdk8 module subunits to transcriptional regulation using RNA interference in Drosophila cells. Genome-wide expression profiling demonstrated separation of Cdk8-CycC and Med12-Med13 profiles. However, transcriptional regulation by Cdk8-CycC was dependent on Med12-Med13. This observation also revealed that Cdk8-CycC and Med12-Med13 often have opposite transcriptional effects. Interestingly, Med12 and Med13 profiles overlapped significantly with that of the GATA factor Serpent. Accordingly, mutational analyses indicated that GATA sites are required for Med12-Med13 regulation of Serpent-dependent genes. Med12 and Med13 were also found to be required for Serpent-activated innate immunity genes in defense to bacterial infection. The results reveal a novel role for the Cdk8 module in Serpent-dependent transcription and innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1972133451,"Background Developing retinas display retinal waves, the patterned spontaneous activity essential for circuit refinement. During the first postnatal week in rodents, retinal waves are mediated by synaptic transmission between starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The neuromodulator adenosine is essential for the generation of retinal waves. However, the cellular basis underlying adenosine's regulation of retinal waves remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether and how the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) regulates retinal waves and whether A2AR regulation of retinal waves acts via presynaptic SACs. Methodology/Principal Findings We showed that A2AR was expressed in the inner plexiform layer and ganglion cell layer of the developing rat retina. Knockdown of A2AR decreased the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients, suggesting that endogenous A2AR may up-regulate wave frequency. To investigate whether A2AR acts via presynaptic SACs, we targeted gene expression to SACs by the metabotropic glutamate receptor type II promoter. Ca2+ transient frequency was increased by expressing wild-type A2AR (A2AR-WT) in SACs, suggesting that A2AR may up-regulate retinal waves via presynaptic SACs. Subsequent patch-clamp recordings on RGCs revealed that presynaptic A2AR-WT increased the frequency of wave-associated postsynaptic currents (PSCs) or depolarizations compared to the control, without changing the RGC's excitability, membrane potentials, or PSC charge. These findings suggest that presynaptic A2AR may not affect the membrane properties of postsynaptic RGCs. In contrast, by expressing the C-terminal truncated A2AR mutant (A2AR-ΔC) in SACs, the wave frequency was reduced compared to the A2AR-WT, but was similar to the control, suggesting that the full-length A2AR in SACs is required for A2AR up-regulation of retinal waves. Conclusions/Significance A2AR up-regulates the frequency of retinal waves via presynaptic SACs, requiring its full-length protein structure. Thus, by coupling with the downstream intracellular signaling, A2AR may have a great capacity to modulate patterned spontaneous activity during neural circuit refinement."

Importantly, the effects of AICAr on mammalian cells are generally fully reversed by inhibition of adenosine kinase activity with drugs such as 5-iodotubercidin, establishing that, in most cases, AICAr has to be metabolized to AICAR monophosphate to be active (as expected for an AMP-mimetic).

Interestingly, in yeast the AMPK homolog named Snf1 appears unaffected by AICAR (16Pinson B. Vaur S. Sagot I. Coulpier F. Lemoine S. Daignan-Fornier B.

Yeast is therefore a very promising model to identify new AICAR targets and decipher the molecular mechanisms connecting AICAR monophosphate accumulation to its toxic effects. Here, we used a genetic approach to explore the molecular bases of AICAr sensitivity in this simple eukaryotic model. Our results revealed a link between AICAr sensitivity and thiamine metabolism and allowed us to identify Nrt1 as the major AICAr transporter in yeast. SD is a synthetic minimal medium containing 5% ammonium sulfate, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% glucose. SDcasaW is SD medium supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids (Difco) and tryptophan (0.2 mm). When indicated, adenine (0.3 mm) and/or uracil (0.3 mm) were added in SDcasaW medium, resulting in a medium named SDcasaWA (+ adenine), and SDcasaWAU (+ adenine + uracil). SC medium was prepared as described by Sherman et al. (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor, New York1986Google Scholar). SC complete medium is SC medium supplemented with adenine (0.3 mm), uracil (0.3 mm), histidine (0.06 mm), leucine (0.4 mm), lysine (0.06 mm), and tryptophan (0.2 mm). Yeast strains (see Table 1) belong to, or are derived from, a set of disrupted strains isogenic to BY4741 or BY4742 purchased from Euroscarf. Multimutant strains were obtained by crossing, sporulation, and micromanipulation of meiosis progeny.FIGURE 7AICAr uptake occurs through adenosine transport systems in human cells.

D, dipyridamole alleviates AICAr accumulation in SF188 cells. Relative AICAR content was determined after metabolite extractions of cells grown and treated with AICAr (500 μm, 20 min) as in Fig. 7B, but in the absence (control, set up at 1) or presence of increasing concentrations of the nucleoside transporter inhibitors dipyridamole (DP) added 1 min before AICAr. E, dipyridamole protects SF188 cells against AICAr toxicity. Cell proliferation was determined by using the WST-1 colorimetric assay on SF188 cells grown for 3 days in the absence (blue triangles) or in the presence of 0.3 mm (orange circles) or 1 mm (red circles) of external AICAr and in the presence or not of dipyridamole.

To obtain AICAr-hypersensitive mutants, two ade16 ade17 ade8 his1 strains (Y6986 and Y7242) were plated on SD casa WAU medium, mutagenized with UV light for 20 s, and then grown for 72 h at 30 °C. The resulting clones (64,000) were then transferred by replica plating on the same medium containing various AICAr concentrations (1 or 2 mm at 30 °C and 0.5 or 1 mm at 37 °C). Thereby, 27 AICAr hypersensitive mutants were isolated from the two yeast strains (17 from Y6986 and 10 from Y7242), and 3 of these mutants were further studied. Each mutant was crossed with an ade16 ade17 ade8 his1 strain, and the meiotic progeny of the cross was phenotypically characterized. Genomic DNA extraction from pools of AICAr-resistant and -sensitive spores (see text for details) was carried out on cells grown to a final density of 5 × 107 cells/ml, as recommended by the genomic tips 100G kit supplier (Qiagen). Yeast genome resequencing and bioinformatics analyses were done by GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). Once identified, mutations of interest in the mutant pools were verified on individual spores by Sanger sequencing (GATC Biotech). Extraction of yeast metabolites was performed by the rapid filtration and ethanol boiling method as described (23Laporte D. Lebaudy A. Sahin A. Pinson B. Ceschin J. Daignan-Fornier B. Sagot I. Metabolic status rather than cell cycle signals control quiescence entry and exit.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For mammalian cells, each extraction was done from one 78.5-cm2 Petri dish containing subconfluent cells (< 105 cells/cm2) grown in the complete medium. The cells were rapidly washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and then extraction was performed by incubation of cells for 5 min in 5 ml of ethanol (80%). The suspension was then transferred into a glass tube and incubated for 3 min at 80 °C. Samples were evaporated using a rotavapor device. The residue was suspended in sterile water (100 μl/107cells), and insoluble particles were eliminated by centrifugation (1 h, 4 °C, 21,000 × g). For both yeast and mammalian cells, metabolite separation was performed on an ICS3000 chromatography station (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) using a CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 2 mm; Dionex) with the 50–800 mm acetate gradient in 50 mm NaOH described in Ref. 1Hürlimann H.C.

Two highly conserved domains characterize Dbl family GEFs: a unique Dbl homology domain and a pleckstrin homology domain. The Dbl homology domain is the minimal unit necessary for GEF activity that binds the substrate GTPase and catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP in its binding pocket (2Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T.

Following GEF-mediated activation, the bound GTP is hydrolyzed, and the GTPase returns to its quiescent state. The pleckstrin homology domain is thought to mediate proper localization of the GEF to specific subcellular compartments (3Haslam R.J. Koide H.B.

Because GTPases control multiple and diverse aspects of cellular physiology, proper regulation of GEF activities is crucial for normal cellular function. Indeed, mutations that cause GEF overexpression or gain of function result in persistent activation of downstream pathways and lead to aberrant cell growth that manifest in developmental disorders and cancers. For example, mutations in Fgd1 cause the X-linked developmental disorder, Aarskog-Scott syndrome (11Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W.

As our appreciation for the involvement of Dbl family GEFs in disease grows, the need for understanding the mechanisms that regulate these proteins increases. The upstream events that regulate the GEF activity of Dbl are poorly understood. Dbl is thought to exist in an inhibited state, which is activated by growth factor receptors; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the inhibited state and its release are incompletely understood. Some studies proposed an intramolecular autoinhibited state brought about by interactions between the amino and carboxyl termini of Dbl (25Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Autoinhibition mechanism of proto-Dbl.Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that association with the molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 regulate Dbl activity by controlling its degradation by the proteasome (26Kamynina E. Kauppinen K. Duan F.

The mechanisms by which growth factor stimulation leads to release of Dbl inhibition are completely unknown. In this study, we aimed to understand the upstream events that relieve Dbl autoinhibition and stimulate its GEF activity. We show that a key feature of the activation cycle of Dbl involves reversible, growth factor-sensitive, tyrosine phosphorylation. COS7 cells and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). Parental and EGFR-expressing CHO cells were a generous gift from Dr. Cathleen Carlin, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and were cultured in minimum essential mediumα supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Dbl constructs encoded the reading frame encoding the full-length protein (residues 1–925) in the pCMV6 vector, or the pCEFL-GST vector (for focus formation experiments). Recombinant GTPases were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusions and purified as described previously (28Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D.

Grb2 cDNA (HA-tagged in the pCGN vector) was a generous gift from Dr. Dafna Bar-Sagi, New York University School of Medicine. All transfections were done using PolyFect (Qiagen). EGF (Sigma) was dissolved in serum-free DMEM and used at a final concentration of 50 nm. 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2, EMD Millipore) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at a final concentration of 1 or 10 μm, as was Iressa (gefitnib, Selleck Biochemicals). The phosphatase inhibitor-activated sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) was added during the last 10 min to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. Lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and cleared supernatant was combined with anti-Dbl antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-89, 1:100 dilution) or anti-HA antibody (Covance, MMS-101R, 1:100). The lysate-antibody mixture was mixed at 4 °C for 1 h before the addition of 50 μl of protein A beads (Millipore) and mixing at 4 °C for 2.5 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and spun at 3,500 rpm for 3 min. Precipitated beads were boiled in 2.5× Lamelli buffer, and the supernatant was resolved by 8–12% SDS-PAGE. Tyrosine phosphorylation was visualized using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10-platinum, Millipore, 1:1000 dilution). Whole brain extracts from 10-day-old mice were homogenized manually in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation with Dbl antibody as described above. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange XL II, Agilent). Five hours prior to lysis, cells were switched to MEMα containing 0.5% FBS. After 3 h, cells were placed on ice for 2 h and treated as indicated (EGF, Iressa, or PP2). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitations as described above. COS7 cells were co-transfected with HA-Grb2 and Dbl constructs, harvested in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Association was visualized by anti-HA immunoblotting of anti-Dbl immunoprecipitates. These were designed based on the established high affinity of GEFs to their nucleotide-free form of their cognate GTPases (29Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y.

Wild-type GTPases and their respective nucleotide-free mutants (Cdc42(T17N) or RhoA(T19N)) were expressed in E. coli as GST fusions and purified as described previously (32Wu W.J. Leonard D.A.

The purified GTPases were immobilized on glutathione agarose and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer supplemented with 50 μm GDP, 10 mm MgCl2 (wild-type GTPase), or 10 mm EDTA (Asn17/Asn19 GTPase). Dbl-transfected cells were lysed in the same lysis buffer, incubated with immobilized GTPases at 4 °C for 2 h, and washed three times in the respective buffers, prior to SDS-PAGE and anti-Dbl immunoblotting. To measure GEF activity, the fraction of endogenous GTPase that is in the active (GTP-bound) state was determined using an established selective precipitation approach (33Bagrodia S. Dérijard B.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with Dbl cDNA, serum-starved for 31 h, and lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. Lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and cleared supernatant was combined with ∼20 μg of immobilized GST-fused GTPase-binding domain of rhotekin and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h (34Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Determination of GTP loading on Rho.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE. The amount of activated (bead-associated) GTPase was visualized with anti-RhoA (Cytoskeleton, 1:200 dilution) immunoblotting and compared with the total GTPase levels as determined by anti-RhoA immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. NIH3T3 cells were plated in triplicate in a 24-well plate and co-transfected with the NFκB response element fused to the luciferase reporter construct (pGL3B-HIV1-luc), the β-galactosidase-expressing pCH110 (Pharmacia), and Dbl cDNA. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were washed in serum-free medium and starved for 17 h prior to harvesting cell lysates and measuring luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase expression was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to account for differences in transfection efficiency. The indicated constructs were used to transfect subconfluent NIH3T3 cells in 10-cm plates. After 48 h, media was replaced, and cells were refed every other day. Approximately 2 weeks after transfection, cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet, and foci were manually scored. NIH3T3 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with the indicated constructs (opr empty pCMV6 vector as control) using PolyFect according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Thirty-one hours post-transfection, cells were serum-starved for 17 h, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, stained with the indicated reagents, and imaged using the Leica TCS SP2 microscope. Dbl proteins were visualized using Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-89 antibody and a secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) antibody; the actin cytoskeleton was visualized with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). In a search for post-translational events that may regulate the GEF activity of Dbl, we found that anti-Dbl immunoprecipitates give a strong signal on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots. Importantly, the signal was only visible in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Fig. 1A). The physiological relevance of this finding is evident by the observation that tyrosine phosphorylation of Dbl occurs in intact tissue where the protein is expressed, such as mouse brain (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we found that when serum-deprived COS7 cells are treated with serum, Dbl phosphorylation transiently increases after 2–5 min and then tapers off (Fig. 1C). These observations show that Dbl is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) and that this modification is a regulated event, dependent on growth factors. To begin to delineate the upstream events that regulate Dbl phosphorylation, we used pharmacological inhibitors of two major intracellular tyrosine kinases: Iressa (gefitinib), which inhibits the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, and the inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases, PP2. To confirm these findings we examined whether expression of the EGFR kinase affects the phosphorylation of Dbl. In CHO cells that stably overexpress the EGFR kinase, stimulation with EGF caused a marked phosphorylation of Dbl (Fig. 1D). Moreover, modification was inhibited by treatment with either Iressa or PP2. Importantly, Dbl expression, but not phosphorylation, was observed in the parental CHO cell line, which does not express EGFR (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of Dbl is mediated by mitogenic stimulation through the activated EGF receptor and a Src family kinase. Furthermore, the data suggest that in this pathway, the Src family kinase is downstream of EGFR. We utilized a bioinformatics approach to identify the tyrosine residue(s) that are phosphorylated in Dbl. The NetPhos2.0 algorithm (36Blom N. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Gupta R. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Prediction of post-translational glycosylation and phosphorylation of proteins from the amino acid sequence.Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar) identified seven residues in Dbl that reside within tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sequences. These putative phosphorylation sites are dispersed throughout the different domains of the protein (Tyr217, Tyr510, Tyr553, Tyr749, Tyr780, Tyr787, and Tyr904; see Fig. 2A). We focused our attention to Tyr510, due to its position in a high-scoring putative phosphorylation sequence in the catalytic Dbl homology domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we substituted Tyr510 of Dbl to a phenylalanine and observed a dramatic decrease (∼80%) in the tyrosine phosphorylation intensity of the protein (Fig. 2B). The fact that some tyrosine phosphorylation persists in the Y510F mutant indicates that sites of tyrosine phosphorylation other than Tyr510 exist in the protein. In attempting to identify such residues, we found that mutation of Tyr787 did not affect the residual phosphorylation signal observed in Dbl(Y510F) (data not shown).FIGURE 2Tyr510 is an important site of phosphorylation in Dbl. A, domain structure of the Dbl protein. Of the 29 tyrosines of Dbl, the top-scoring putative phosphorylation sites are indicated, as well as the immediate sequence surrounding Tyr510. B, tyrosine phosphorylation of Dbl(Y510F) was examined as in Fig. 1A. Data are representative of three independent experiments. PY, phosphotyrosine; IB, immunoblot; DH, Dbl homology domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; SPEC, spectrin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the molecular consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation in Dbl, we examined its ability to associate with established effectors. Grb2 is an adapter molecule that contains an Src homology 2 domain that binds phosphorylated tyrosine residues and an Src homology 3 domain that binds proline-rich sequences (37Downward J. The GRB2/Sem-5 adaptor protein.FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Due to this dual-recognition capacity, Grb2 often functions as a “bridging” adapter, allowing it to recruit multiple proteins to their cellular site of activation, as seen in the activation of Ras, where Grb2 recruits Son of Sevenless to the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor (38Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Human Sos1: a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras that binds to GRB2.Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 39Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Grb2 mediates the EGF-dependent activation of guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras.Nature. 1993; 363: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Because Grb2 was recently reported to be associated with Dbl (40Blajecka, K., Marinov, M., Leitner, L., Uth, K., Posern, G., Arcaro, A., Phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2β regulates RhoA and the actin cytoskeleton through an interaction with Dbl. PLoS One 7, e44945Google Scholar), we sought to evaluate the role of Tyr510 phosphorylation in this interaction. As seen in Fig. 3A, substitution of the Tyr510 of Dbl with a non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine residue greatly diminished Grb2 binding. Furthermore, the association between Grb2 and Dbl required the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Fig. 3B). Together, these data strongly suggest that phosphorylation of the Tyr510 of Dbl is critical for its binding to Grb2. Next, we asked whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Dbl is necessary for association of the GEF with its substrate GTPase. Cells expressing Dbl (or its phospho-defective mutant) were lysed and precipitated with immobilized recombinant GTPases that have been purified in either the GDP-bound form (GST-fused wild-type GTPases) or the nucleotide-free form (GST-RhoA(T19N) or GST-Cdc42(T17N) mutants). The rationale for this design is based on the notion that the highest affinity of GEFs to their GTPase is observed in the nucleotide-free form of the latter (29Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Cellular transformation and guanine nucleotide exchange activity are catalyzed by a common domain on the dbl oncogene product.J. Biol.

The GTPase superfamily: conserved structure and molecular mechanism.Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed a strong preference in the association of Dbl with the nucleotide-free forms of RhoA and Cdc42, as compared with the GDP-bound GTPases (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 4, A and B). Importantly, we observed that the affinity of the nucleotide-free GTPase to the GEF is dramatically reduced when phosphorylation of Tyr510 of Dbl is abolished by mutation to phenylalanine (Fig. 4, A and B). These findings indicate that that phosphorylation of Tyr510 is required for Dbl to be able to bind substrate Rho GTPases. To address the role of Tyr510 phosphorylation in Dbl activity as a GEF, we examined its ability to stimulate GTP binding by a substrate GTPase. Because both Cdc42 and Rac1 are phosphorylated on Tyr64 (41Tu S. Wu W.J. Wang J. Cerione R.A. Epidermal growth factor-dependent regulation of Cdc42 is mediated by the Src tyrosine kinase.J. Biol.

Manor, unpublished results. whereas RhoA is not (Fig. 5A), we chose to focus on the latter GTPase. This allowed us to evaluate the effect of kinase inhibitors on Dbl actions without complication arising from the effect of the inhibitors on the substrate GTPase. We treated Dbl-transfected cells with Iressa and measured the GEF activity of Dbl by selectively precipitating GTP-bound form of RhoA ((33Bagrodia S. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A.

We found that treatment with Iressa all but abolished the ability of Dbl to activate RhoA (Fig. 5B), indicating that EGFR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Dbl is essential for its activity as a GEF. Importantly, substitution of Tyr510 to phenylalanine abolished the GEF activity of Dbl (Fig. 5C). Next, we examined the role of Tyr510 phosphorylation on further downstream signaling events. We found that the Y510F mutant of Dbl abolished transcriptional activation of NFkB (Fig. 6A), a downstream effector of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (42Cammarano M.S. Minden A.

https://openalex.org/W2039847600,"During surveillance programs in Korea between January 2006 and March 2011, 31 H7 avian influenza viruses were isolated from wild birds and domestic ducks and genetically characterized using large-scale sequence data. All Korean H7 viruses belonged to the Eurasian lineage, which showed substantial genetic diversity, in particular in the wild birds. The Korean H7 viruses from poultry were closely related to those of wild birds. Interestingly, two viruses originating in domestic ducks in our study had the same gene constellations in all segment genes as viruses originating in wild birds. The Korean H7 isolates contained avian-type receptors (Q226 and G228), no NA stalk deletion (positions 69–73), no C-terminal deletion (positions 218–230) in NS1, and no substitutions in PB2-627, PB1-368, and M2-31, compared with H7N9 viruses. In pathogenicity experiments, none of the Korean H7 isolates tested induced clinical signs in domestic ducks or mice. Furthermore, while they replicated poorly, with low titers (10 0.7–1.3EID50/50 µl) in domestic ducks, all five viruses replicated well (up to 7–10 dpi, 10 0.7–4.3EID50/50 µl) in the lungs of mice, without prior adaptation. Our results suggest that domestic Korean viruses were transferred directly from wild birds through at least two independent introductions. Our data did not indicate that wild birds carried poultry viruses between Korea and China, but rather, that wild-type H7 viruses were introduced several times into different poultry populations in eastern Asia."

Twenty-three GPA patients and 20 controls were evaluated for HMGB1- and sRAGE levels and for carotid atherosclerosis using ultrasound to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). In vitro the effect of atorvastatin on the production of HMGB1 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was assessed. Serum HMGB1 and sRAGE levels did not differ between patients and controls. A negative correlation was found between sRAGE and maximum IMT but HMGB1 and carotid IMT were not related. HMGB1 levels were reduced in GPA patients on statins and prednisolone. In vitro, atorvastatin reduced HMGB1 levels in supernatants of activated HUVEC. In conclusion, carotid IMT is inversely correlated with sRAGE levels but not with HMGB1 levels. Statins and prednisolone are associated with reduced serum HMGB1 levels and atorvastatin decreases HMGB1 release by activated HUVEC in vitro, indicating an additional anti-inflammatory effect of statins."
https://openalex.org/W1980419160,"Objective To identify and investigate the susceptibility genes of Kashin–Beck disease (KBD) in Chinese population. Methods Whole-exome capturing and sequencing technology was used for the detection of genetic variations in 19 individuals from six families with high incidence of KBD. A total of 44 polymorphisms from 41 genes were genotyped from a total of 144 cases and 144 controls by using MassARRAY under the standard protocol from Sequenom. Association was applied on the data by using PLINK1.07. Results In the sequencing stage, each sample showed approximately 70-fold coverage, thus covering more than 99% of the target regions. Among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used in the transmission disequilibrium test, 108 had a p-value of <0.01, whereas 1056 had a p-value of <0.05. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway analysis indicates that these SNPs focus on three major pathways: regulation of actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, and metabolic pathways. In the validation stage, single locus effects revealed that two of these polymorphisms (rs7745040 and rs9275295) in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 gene and one polymorphism (rs9473132) in CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) gene have a significant statistical association with KBD. Conclusions HLA-DRB1 and CD2AP gene were identified to be among the susceptibility genes of KBD, thus supporting the role of the autoimmune response in KBD and the possibility of shared etiology between osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and KBD."
https://openalex.org/W2326665525,"The major function of the Haptoglobin (Hp) protein is to control trafficking of extracorpuscular hemoglobin (Hb) thru the macrophage CD163 receptor with degradation of the Hb in the lysosome. There is a common copy number polymorphism in the Hp gene (Hp 2 allele) that has been associated with a severalfold increased incidence of atherothrombosis in multiple longitudinal studies. Increased plaque oxidation and apoptotic markers have been observed in Hp 2-2 atherosclerotic plaques, but the mechanism responsible for this finding has not been determined. We proposed that the increased oxidative injury in Hp 2-2 plaques is due to an impaired processing of Hp 2-2-Hb complexes within macrophage lysosomes, thereby resulting in redox active iron accumulation, lysosomal membrane oxidative injury, and macrophage apoptosis. We sought to test this hypothesis in vitro using purified Hp-Hb complex and cells genetically manipulated to express CD163. CD163-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of Hp-Hb were decreased for Hp 2-2-Hb complexes. Confocal microscopy using lysotropic pH indicator dyes demonstrated that uptake of Hp 2-2-Hb complexes disrupted the lysosomal pH gradient. Cellular fractionation studies of lysosomes isolated from macrophages incubated with Hp 2-2-Hb complexes demonstrated increased lysosomal membrane oxidation and a loss of lysosomal membrane integrity leading to lysosomal enzyme leakage into the cytoplasm. Additionally, markers of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and active caspase 3 were increased in macrophages that had endocytosed Hp 2-2-Hb complexes.

During IPH, free extracorpuscular hemoglobin (Hb) is rapidly captured by haptoglobin (Hp) and endocytosed as a complex via the macrophage CD163 scavenger receptor (8Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H.

Therefore, IPH may be a potent oxidative stimulus for macrophage activation and cell injury. Although it is not fully understood, macrophage apoptosis has been shown to be an important response to intracellular oxidative stress and cholesterol accumulation within the advanced atherosclerotic lesions and is ultimately responsible for plaque destabilization and rupture (11Kockx M.M.

The mechanism explaining why increased hemoglobin-driven oxidative injury exists in Hp 2-2 and how this leads to increased atherothrombosis in this population is not known. In this study we sought to test our hypothesis that the increased oxidative injury and atherothrombotic events that have been observed in Hp 2-2 and DM are due to an impaired processing and injury induced by the Hp 2-2-Hb complex within macrophage lysosomes. Hp was purified from human plasma using a polyclonal goat anti-haptoglobin antibody affinity column. Hb was isolated from human red blood cells as previously described (15Melamed-Frank M. Lache O. Enav B.I. Szafranek T. Levy N.S. Ricklis R.M. Levy A.P. Structure-function analysis of the antioxidant properties of haptoglobin.Blood. 2001; 98: 3693-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Met-Hb was prepared by incubation of 1.1 mm potassium ferrocyanide with 1 mm oxy-Hb for 30 min at room temperature and then purification of met-Hb using PD-10 columns as previously described (17Asleh R. Guetta J. Kalet-Litman S. Miller-Lotan R. Levy A.P. Haptoglobin genotype- and diabetes-dependent differences in iron-mediated oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Hb was glycosylated in vitro using glycolaldehyde (Fluka AG) as previously described (26Twigg S.M. Chen M.M. Joly A.H. Chakrapani S.D. Tsubaki J. Kim H.S. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Advanced glycosylation end products up-regulate connective tissue growth factor (insulin-like growth factor binding protein related protein 2) in human fibroblasts; a potential mechanism for expansion of extracellular matrix in diabetes mellitus.Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Hp-Hb complex was formed by incubating the complex at different concentrations at room temperature for 15 min before it was used. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Biosciences. A LysoSensor yellow/blue DND-160 probe was purchased from Molecular Probes. The caspase 3 fluorometric assay kit was purchased from Biovision, and caspase 3 inhibitor was purchased from Mercury. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Hp was labeled as previously described (16Asleh R. Marsh S. Shilkrut M. Binah O. Guetta J. Lejbkowicz F. Enav B. Shehadeh N. Kanter Y. Lache O. Cohen O. Levy N.S. Levy A.P. Genetically determined heterogeneity in hemoglobin scavenging and susceptibility to diabetic cardiovascular disease.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All LDL preparations were isolated from pooled plasma of healthy volunteers. Vitamin E-enriched LDL was prepared as described previously with some modifications (27Bowen H.T. Omaye S.T. Oxidative changes associated with β-carotene and α-tocopherol enrichment of human low-density lipoproteins.J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1998; 17: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, water-miscible α-tocopherol was added to plasma to reach a final concentration of 460 mm. The mixture was vortexed then incubated at 37 °C in the dark overnight with continuous shaking. Native LDL was prepared as described above for with the addition of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to plasma instead of α-tocopherol. LDL (native or vitamin E-enriched LDL) were then isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation as previously described (28Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Sequential flotation ultracentrifugation.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). LDL was acetylated using acetic anhydride as previously described (29Maor I.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 803-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis against PBS for 48 h, LDL concentration was determined by Lowry (55Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Hp was radio-iodinated using the chloramine-T method as previously described (16Asleh R. Marsh S. Shilkrut M. Binah O. Guetta J. Lejbkowicz F. Enav B. Shehadeh N. Kanter Y. Lache O. Cohen O. Levy N.S. Levy A.P. Genetically determined heterogeneity in hemoglobin scavenging and susceptibility to diabetic cardiovascular disease.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg (Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2) was mixed with 50 μl of NaH2PO4, 0.5 mCi of 125I, and 5 μl of chloramine T (8.8 mm) and stirred for 45 s at room temperature. Then 12.5 μl of Na2S2O5 (10.5 mm) was added to terminate the reaction. The labeled protein was purified using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) with PBS running buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The specific activity of 125I-Hp was about 50,000 cpm/ng of protein for both Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2 proteins. CHO cells were stably transfected with the human CD163 receptor, and its expression was confirmed by Western blot using a CD163 monoclonal antibody. CHO/CD163 cells were grown in large plates in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS (v/v), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 IU/ml), and streptomycin (86 nm) for 48 h. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated in F-12 medium containing glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% BSA and with 1% FCS before they were used for lysosomes assay. THP-1 cells were grown in suspension with RPMI medium with 10% FCS. The THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages by treatment with 16.2 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 3 days. LDL-loaded cells were prepared by incubating THP-1-differentiated macrophages for an additional day with 300 μg/ml native LDL or vitamin E-enriched LDL and then with 30 μg/ml acetylated LDL for another 6 h to get foam cell-like macrophages. Control (non-loaded) cells were incubated with medium only without any addition of LDL. Hb alone or complexed to Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2 was added to CHO/CD163 or differentiated THP-1 cells (control or LDL-loaded cells) grown in medium containing 1% BSA at a final concentration of 1 μm Hb or 1 μm Hb-Hp complex (1:1 molar ratio of Hp and Hb). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator overnight, after which complexes were removed, and the cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 1% BSA. For the hydrogen peroxide assay, cells were incubated with medium containing 50 μm of H2O2 with or without the Hp-Hb complexes for overnight before the cells were washed 3 times as described above and prepared for the lysosomes-rich fraction (LRF) purification. For conditions designed to mimic DM, glycosylated Hb was used instead of native Hb or cells were grown in high glucose medium (22.2 mm). THP-1 cells were grown and differentiated to macrophages in 12-well tissue culture plates as described above. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated with 1 million cpm of 125I-Hp (with or without 1:1 molar ratio of Hb) in RPMI tissue culture medium with 0.5% serum at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 2 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed 3 times (removing all label and prohibiting further association and uptake of radiolabeled Hp-Hb complex), and the amount of radioactivity (counts) remaining with the cells at that time was taken as 100% (T0). The amount of cell associated counts was then monitored over the next 24 h. Cell-associated radioactivity was assessed at the defined time points after first washing the cells by lysing them with 1 ml of 1% SDS and then subjecting the solubilized cell extract to γ-scintillation counting. Degradation was measured as a function of time by calculating the percentage of remaining cell-associated counts at different time points relative to the counts measured at T0. LRF was purified from CHO/CD163 or THP-1 cells as previously described with some modifications (30Graham J.M. Isolation of Lysosomes from tissues and cells by differential and density gradient centrifugation.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2000; (doi: 10.1002/0471143030.cb0306s07)Google Scholar). Cells were detached from the plates using trypsin, washed once with homogenization medium (HM) (containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to PH 7.0), and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The cells were then suspended in HM and homogenized in a ball-bearing cell homogenizer using 5 passes. The cell homogenate was washed with HM and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to pellet the nuclei, cell debris, and any unbroken cells. This step was repeated twice after which the LRF was used in the lysosomal fragility assay. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma B6916) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of the lysosomal preparations was assessed by determining the activity of acid phosphatase (lysosomal marker, Sigma kit #CS0740) and cathepsin D (lysosomal marker, Sigma kit #CS0800), all according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lysosomal membrane integrity was determined by incubating the suspended LRF at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the activity of the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase was measured using the fluorimetric substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-Glucopyranoside (30Graham J.M.

Because intact organelle membranes prevent substrate access to the luminal enzyme, no substrate turnover indicates integrity of the organelle, whereas in the presence of the detergent Triton X-100 total enzyme activity was assessed. Briefly, 50 μl of portion of the LRF suspension pool was incubated for 1 min at 37 °C with 250 μl of 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.5, and 1.2 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside with and without 0.2% Triton X-100. The reaction was terminated after 1 min by the addition of 1 ml of 0.5 m glycine, sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10. The liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was determined by measuring the fluorescence in a BMG GalaxyFlouroStar microplate reader with a 365/450-nm excitation/emission filter pair. The degree of lysosomal loss of integrity (leakage) was expressed as % fragility (activity in the absence of detergent/activity in the presence of detergent) × 100. Hb-driven oxidation of LDL was assessed at pH 7 using PBS as a reaction buffer and pH 4.5 using citric acid as a reaction buffer. LDL (300 μg/ml) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with free oxy-Hb, Met-Hb or glycosylated Hb alone (10 μm) in the presence of H2O2 (20 μm). The change in LDL oxidation using Hp was assessed using the same method but in the presence of increasing concentrations of Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2 (2.5 μm up to 20 μm for each type) complexed to Hb at different pH. Oxidation of LDL lipids was determined using the thiobarbituric reactive substances assay as previously described (32el-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. el-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jürgens G. Spectrophotometric assay for lipid peroxides in serum lipoproteins using a commercially available reagent.J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data are presented as the percentage of reduction in LDL oxidation in the presence of Hp compared with LDL oxidation in the absence of Hp. For preparation of radiolabeled Hb, MEL cells (a kind gift of Professor Ben-Zion Levi) were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For preparation of radiolabeled Hb, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM/F-12 1:1 medium (Beit HaEmek) supplemented with 10 mg/ml BSA, 5 μg/ml insulin, 12 μg/ml cholesterol, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml Fe55 loaded (see protocol below for loading transferring with iron) transferrin, and 2% DMSO. Cells were harvested on day 4, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Lysed cells were spun at 5000 rpm (4696 × g) in a tabletop centrifuge for 15 min. The supernatant was passed over a 0.5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and washed with 10 ml of 10 mm imidazole, and the bound fraction was eluted with 1 ml of 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was spun over a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) to remove the imidazole. Further purification was achieved by adding 0.25 ml of Hemoglobind resin (Biotech Support Group) and rotating for 30 min at room temperature. The resin was spun down at 1000 × g for 2 min in a microcentrifuge. Purified Hb was eluted using 2 × 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium carbonate, and the buffer was exchanged for PBS using a PD-10 column. A single band at 16,000 kDa was observed by Coomassie staining on a polyacrylamide reducing gel. The specific activity of the radiolabeled Hb was 10–50 cpm/ng. For preparation of transferrin loaded with 55Fe, nitrilotriacetate (NTA), pH 3, was mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio at room temperature for 30 min with Fe55Cl3 (18.5 mCi/mg, catalog no. NEZ043, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to form ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe(NTA)2). Apotransferrin (Kamada, Ltd) was prepared in Hepes-buffered saline (50 mm, pH 7.4) and mixed with Fe(NTA)2 at a molar ratio of 4:1 in the presence of sodium bicarbonate (0.05 m final) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (this mixture should be reddish; 1 n NaOH can be added to the Fe(NTA)2 until the mixture becomes reddish before mixing with apotransferrin. The pH should be 7.4) Radiolabeled transferrin was stored in aliquots and kept at −20 °C. For heme transfer assay, human LDL was isolated by density gradient centrifugation according to established protocols and kept covered at 4 °C. LDL was then conjugated to Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Fe55 Hb was converted to met-Hb by incubation with a 1.1 molar excess of potassium ferricyanide at room temperature for 30 min followed by purification of over a PD-10 column. Fe55 met-Hb (4.5 μg) was mixed with 20 μl of LDL Sepharose beads (26 μg of LDL) and various components in a total of 50 μl of PBS, pH 7.4. Mixtures at low pH contained 5 μl of 1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.3. The mixture was placed in a microtiter dish and mixed at room temperature for 3 h. Beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 and spun down at 1000 × g for 1 min. Beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1% SDS and counted in 4 ml of scintillation fluid. Background was determined by incubating Fe55 met-Hb and LDL beads separately at room temperature for 3 h followed by mixing the two together and washing immediately. Percent heme transferred was calculated as the number of counts recovered in the beads minus the number of counts obtained in the background samples divided by the number of counts added to the reaction multiplied by 100. Total and iron-dependent oxidative stress of LRF was assessed using DHR as a sensitive fluorescent indicator of oxidative activity and carried out as described previously with some modifications (17Asleh R. Guetta J. Kalet-Litman S. Miller-Lotan R. Levy A.P. Haptoglobin genotype- and diabetes-dependent differences in iron-mediated oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, quadruplicates of 40 μl of LRF purified from cells treated with different combinations of Hp and Hb complexes were incubated with DHR (50uM) in 180 μl of iron-free Hepes-buffered saline containing 40 μm ascorbic acid in the presence and absence of 50 μm iron chelator (deferiprone). The kinetics of fluorescence increase was assessed in a BMG GalaxyFluoroStar microplate reader with a 485/538-nm excitation/emission filter pair for 40 min. The rate of total oxidation was measured by calculating the slope of DHR fluorescence intensity over time in the absence of iron chelator. To calculate the iron-dependent oxidation associated with LRF, the difference in the rate of oxidation of DHR in the presence and absence of the chelator was then assessed, representing the component of iron that is catalytically redox-active. Redox-active iron concentrations were then determined in each preparation from calibration curves using Hepes-buffered saline with increasing concentrations of Fe-NTA. A LysoSensor yellow/blue DND-160 probe (Molecular Probes) was used to assess lysosomal injury by confocal microscopy. A LysoSensor yellow/blue DND-160 probe is a fluorescent pH indicator used to detect intact lysosomes in live cells. Intact lysosomes with pH around 4.5 elicit yellow fluorescence when labeled with the LysoSensor probe, whereas destabilized lysosomes with higher pH values elicit blue fluorescence. For these experiments THP-1 cells were resuspended to 0.8 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium (containing 10% FCS) and grown in Fluorodish plates (World Precision Instruments, Inc.). After differentiation to macrophages, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated overnight with 1 μm Hb (native Hb or glycosylated Hb) alone or as a complex with 1 μm Hp (Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-2). For using LDL-loaded foam cells, the cells were washed after differentiation and loaded with 300 μg/ml LDL (native or vitamin E-enriched LDL) and then with 30 μg/ml acetylated LDL as described above. Cells were then washed again with PBS and incubated with the Hp-Hb complex. Chloroquine (50 μm), a lysosome inhibitor that causes a dr"
https://openalex.org/W2017379328,"One new order, one new family, and one new combination are presented, as the result of molecular phylogenetic analyses. The new order Stereopsidales and the new family Stereopsidaceae are described incorporating Stereopsis radicans and S. globosa, formerly Clavulicium globosum. We show that not only do these species represent an old overlooked lineage, but both species harbor cryptic diversity. In addition, a third species, C. macounii, appears as a plausible sister to the new lineage, but there is conflict in the data. All specimens of S. radicans and S. globosa analysed here are from the South and Central Americas; several records of S. radicans have been made also from tropical Asia. We expect the true diversity in this group to be a lot higher than presented in this paper. Stereopsis radicans was formerly included in Polyporales, but a placement within that order is rejected by our data through SH tests. The dataset consisted of four nuclear markers: rpb2, tef1, LSU and SSU, each of which was analysed separately using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Recombination detection tests indicate no plausible recombinations. The potential of S. radicans, S. globosa and C. macounii being amphitallic is briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2092186181,"Although some studies have demonstrated that the indirectly measured attitude towards alcohol is related to alcohol use, this relationship has not always been confirmed. In the current study, we attempted to shed light on this issue by investigating whether the predictive validity of an indirect attitude measure is dependent upon attitude accessibility. In a sample of 88 students, the picture-picture naming task, an adaptation of the affective priming paradigm, was used to measure the automatically activated attitude towards beer. Attitude accessibility was measured using a speeded evaluative categorization task. Behavioral measures were the amount of beer poured and drunk during a bogus taste test and the choice between a bottle of beer or water at the end of the experiment. In line with our hypothesis, the indirectly measured attitude towards beer predicted behavior during the taste test only when it was highly accessible. In contrast, this attitude was related to choice behavior irrespective of attitude accessibility. This study confirms that indirect attitude measures can be valuable predictors of alcohol-related behavior, but that it is sometimes necessary to take attitude accessibility into account."
https://openalex.org/W2004134627,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionises the diagnosis of retinal disease based on the detection of microscopic rather than subcellular changes in retinal anatomy. However, currently the technique is limited to the detection of microscopic rather than subcellular changes in retinal anatomy. However, coherence based imaging is extremely sensitive to both changes in optical contrast and cellular events at the micrometer scale, and can generate subtle changes in the spectral content of the OCT image. Here we test the hypothesis that OCT image speckle (image texture) contains information regarding otherwise unresolvable features such as organelle changes arising in the early stages of neuronal degeneration. Using ultrahigh resolution (UHR) OCT imaging at 800 nm (spectral width 140 nm) we developed a robust method of OCT image analyses, based on spatial wavelet and texture-based parameterisation of the image speckle pattern. For the first time we show that this approach allows the non-invasive detection and quantification of early apoptotic changes in neurons within 30 min of neuronal trauma sufficient to result in apoptosis. We show a positive correlation between immunofluorescent labelling of mitochondria (a potential source of changes in cellular optical contrast) with changes in the texture of the OCT images of cultured neurons. Moreover, similar changes in optical contrast were also seen in the retinal ganglion cell- inner plexiform layer in retinal explants following optic nerve transection. The optical clarity of the explants was maintained throughout in the absence of histologically detectable change. Our data suggest that UHR OCT can be used for the non-invasive quantitative assessment of neuronal health, with a particular application to the assessment of early retinal disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991394800,"The present study focused on priming effects on pointing with everyday objects. In a set of four experiments, a visuomotor priming paradigm was used to investigate the nature of visuomotor processing (automatic versus task relevant). By manipulating congruency of orientation and location we found that location congruency facilitates the initiation time of pointing whereas orientation congruency does not. We provide evidence to show that motor planning is influenced by the goal of the action, and that how visual information is processed and held in memory depends on the task relevance. These data are consistent with the proposed interaction between visuomotor and higher processes during the planning and execution of actions such as pointing."
