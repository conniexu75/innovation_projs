https://openalex.org/W2594333543,"The human microbiome encodes vast numbers of uncharacterized enzymes, limiting our functional understanding of this community and its effects on host health and disease. By incorporating information about enzymatic chemistry into quantitative metagenomics, we determined the abundance and distribution of individual members of the glycyl radical enzyme superfamily among the microbiomes of healthy humans. We identified many uncharacterized family members, including a universally distributed enzyme that enables commensal gut microbes and human pathogens to dehydrate trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline, the product of the most abundant human posttranslational modification. This ""chemically guided functional profiling"" workflow can therefore use ecological context to facilitate the discovery of enzymes in microbial communities."

We therefore examined whether ANO1 and other members of the ANO family affect intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) signals. It is shown that expression of ANO1 augments Ca2+ store release upon stimulation of GPCRs, whereas knockdown of ANO1, or lack of Ano1 expression in Ano1‒/‒ animals, as shown in an earlier report, inhibits Ca2+ release. ANO6, and −10 show similar effects, whereas expression of ANO4, −8, and −9 attenuate filling of the ER store. The impact of ANO1 and −4 were examined in more detail. ANO1 colocalized and interacted with IP3R, whereas ANO4 colocalized with SERCA Ca2+ pumps and interacted with ORAI-1 channels, respectively. ANO1 Cl currents were rapidly activated exclusively through Ca2+ store release, and remained untouched by influx of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast expression of ANO4 caused a delayed activation of membrane-localized ANO6 channels, solely through store-operated Ca2+ entry via ORAI. Ca2+ signals were inhibited by knocking down expression of endogenous ANO1, −5, −6, and −10 and were also reduced in epithelial cells from Ano10‒/‒ mice. The data suggest that ANOs affect compartmentalized [Ca2+]i signals, which may explain some of the cellular defects related to ANO mutations.—Cabrita, I., Benedetto, R., Fonseca, A., Wanitchakool, P., Sirianant, L., Skryabin, B.

https://openalex.org/W4250362238,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated gene silencing, also known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been a breakthrough technology for functional genomic studies and represents a potential tool for the management of insect pests. Since the inception of RNAi numerous studies documented successful introduction of exogenously synthesized dsRNA or siRNA into an organism triggering highly efficient gene silencing through the degradation of endogenous RNA homologous to the presented siRNA. Managing hemipteran insect pests, especially Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), is critical to food productivity. BMSB was recently introduced into North America where it is both an invasive agricultural pest of high value specialty, row, and staple crops, as well as an indoor nuisance pest. RNAi technology may serve as a viable tool to manage this voracious pest, but delivery of dsRNA to piercing-sucking insects has posed a tremendous challenge. Effective and practical use of RNAi as molecular biopesticides for biocontrol of insects like BMSB in the environment requires that dsRNAs be delivered in vivo through ingestion. Therefore, the key challenge for molecular biologists in developing insect-specific molecular biopesticides is to find effective and reliable methods for practical delivery of stable dsRNAs such as through oral ingestion. Here demonstrated is a reliable delivery system of effective insect-specific dsRNAs through oral feeding through a new delivery system to induce a significant decrease in expression of targeted genes such as JHAMT and Vg. This state-of-the-art delivery method overcomes environmental delivery challenges so that RNAi is induced through insect-specific dsRNAs orally delivered to hemipteran and other insect pests."
https://openalex.org/W2586744409,"Middle-income countries are facing a growing challenge of adequate health care provision for people with multimorbidity. The objectives of this study were to explore the distribution of multimorbidity and to identify patterns of multimorbidity in the Brazilian general adult population. Data from 60202 adults, aged ≥18 years that completed the individual questionnaire of the National Health Survey 2013 (Portuguese: ""Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde""-""PNS"") was used. We defined multimorbidity as the presence of two or more chronic conditions, including self-reported diagnoses and responses to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression. Multivariate Poisson regression analyses were used to explore relationship between multimorbidity and demographic factors. Exploratory tetrachoric factor analysis was performed to identify multimorbidity patterns. 24.2% (95% CI 23.5-24.9) of the study population were multimorbid, with prevalence rate ratios being significantly higher in women, older people and those with lowest educational level. Multimorbidity occurred earlier in women than in men, with half of the women and men aged 55-59 years and 65-69 years, respectively, were multimorbid. The absolute number of people with multimorbidity was approximately 2.5-fold higher in people younger than 65 years than older counterparts (9920 vs 3945). Prevalence rate ratios of any mental health disorder significantly increased with the number of physical conditions. 46.7% of the persons were assigned to at least one of three identified patterns of multimorbidity, including: ""cardio-metabolic"", ""musculoskeletal-mental"" and ""respiratory"" disorders. Multimorbidity in Brazil is as common as in more affluent countries. Women in Brazil develop diseases at younger ages than men. Our findings can inform a national action plan to prevent multimorbidity, reduce its burden and align health-care services more closely with patients' needs."
https://openalex.org/W2586353523,"Overexpression of mitochondria-bound hexokinase II (HKII) in cancer cells plays an important role in their metabolic reprogramming and protects them against apoptosis, thereby facilitating their growth and proliferation. Here, we show that covalently coupling a peptide corresponding to the mitochondrial membrane–binding N-terminal 15 aa of HKII (pHK) to a short, penetration-accelerating sequence (PAS) enhances the cellular uptake, mitochondrial localization, and cytotoxicity of the peptide in HeLa cells. Further analysis revealed that pHK-PAS depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, and depleted intracellular ATP levels. The effects of pHK-PAS were correlated with dissociation of endogenous full-length HKII from mitochondria and release of cytochrome c. Of significance, pHK-PAS treatment of noncancerous HEK293 cells resulted in substantially lower cytotoxicity. Thus, pHK-PAS effectively disrupted the mitochondria-HKII association in cancer cells, which led to mitochondrial dysfunction and, finally, apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the potential of the pHK-PAS cell-penetrating peptide as a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer.—Woldetsadik, A. D., Vogel, M. C., Rabeh, W. M., Magzoub, M.

https://openalex.org/W2586893338,"Puerarin was a major isoflavonoid derived from the Chinese medical herb radix puerariae (Gegen). In present study effect of puerarin on cisplatin nephrotoxicity was evaluated. Rat model of nephrotoxicity was established by a single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (7mg/kg). Puerarin was administrated through caudal vein injection once per day at the dose of 10mg/kg, 30mg/kg and 50mg/kg. Biochemical assays showed that after cisplatin treatment the serum urea and creatinine increased significantly compared with control (P<0.05). Cisplatin treatment significantly increased xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, and significantly decreased the levels and /or activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants (GSH, GPx, GST, GR, SOD, CAT), in the kidney tissues. Renal levels of TNF-α and IL-6, two important inflammatory cytokines, were also upregulated by cisplatin. Histopathological examination indicated that cisplatin treatment resulted in severe necrosis and degeneration, hyaline casts in the tubules, intertubular hemorrhage, congestion and swelling in glomerulus and leukocytes infiltration in the kidney tissues. Western blot results demonstrated that cisplatin increased TLR4 and NF-κB protein expression in the kidney tissues. However, all these changes induced by cisplatin were significantly attenuated by puerarin treatment in dose-dependent manner, which indicated the renal protective effect of puerarin. Cell culture experiments illustrated that puerarin alone treatment concentration-dependently inhibited COLO205 and HeLa tumor cell growth and dose-dependently promoted the antitumor activity of cisplatin in COLO205 and HeLa tumor cells. The promotion effects might be attributed to suppression of cisplatin-increased NF-κB p65 expression by puerarin. Taken together, findings in this study suggested that puerarin exhibited renal protection against cisplatin nephrotoxicity via inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB signaling, with no inhibition but promotion effect on the antitumor activity of cisplatin. Puerarin might be a promising adjuvant agent for cisplatin chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2587369815,"The antibody isotype IgM appears earlier than IgG, within days of onset of symptoms, and is important during the early stages of the adaptive immune response. Little is known about the functional role of IgM during infection with chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a recently reemerging arbovirus that has caused large global outbreaks. In this study, we studied antibody responses in 102 serum samples collected during CHIKV outbreaks in Malaysia. We described the neutralizing role of IgM at different times post-infection and examined the independent contributions of IgM and IgG towards the neutralizing capacity of human immune sera during the early phase of infection, including the differences in targets of neutralizing epitopes. Neutralizing IgM starts to appear as early as day 4 of symptoms, and their appearance from day 6 is associated with a reduction in viremia. IgM acts in a complementary manner with the early IgG, but plays the main neutralizing role up to a point between days 4 and 10 which varies between individuals. After this point, total neutralizing capacity is attributable almost entirely to the robust neutralizing IgG response. IgM preferentially binds and targets epitopes on the CHIKV surface E1-E2 glycoproteins, rather than individual E1 or E2. These findings provide insight into the early antibody responses to CHIKV, and have implications for design of diagnostic serological assays."
https://openalex.org/W2587287510,"Objectives In Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (PSS), there is an apparent lack of data concerning the perspectives of patients, their needs, preferences and difficulties of daily life. This qualitative study was conducted to explore perspectives and needs of patients with PSS that influence health related quality of life (HRQL). Methods We recruited 20 PSS patients fulfilling the American-European consensus classification criteria out of the PSS cohort of the Medical University Graz, Austria. In total, 6 focus group sessions (with three to four patients per group) were performed. A modified meaning condensation procedure was used to analyse the data. Results The interview analysis resulted in 484 meaning units, 254 subconcepts and 86 concepts. The identified concepts were grouped into three dimensions: physical dimension, psychological & emotional challenges and social life & daily living. A dependency between the three categories was identified. The concepts most commonly reported by patients were related to the physical dimension: pain and dryness as well as complaints associated with/provoked by these symptoms. Patients also reported shortness of breath, fatigue und constipation. Conclusions This qualitative study underpins that HRQL in PSS patients is affected by several factors. The problems are not limited to dryness, pain and fatigue while the complaints secondary to these symptoms are important to patients with PSS significantly affecting physical, psychological and social life components of HRQL. A disease-specific patient related outcome measures for clinical practice and trials should be developed considering the different aspects of HRQL in PSS."
https://openalex.org/W2586334251,"The number of people living with HIV on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Myanmar has been increasing rapidly in recent years. This study aimed to estimate rates of virological failure on first-line ART and switching to second-line ART due to treatment failure at the Integrated HIV Care program (IHC).Routinely collected data of all adolescent and adult patients living with HIV who were initiated on first-line ART at IHC between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The cumulative hazard of virological failure on first-line ART and switching to second-line ART were estimated. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox regression model to identify risk factors associated with the two outcomes.Of 23,248 adults and adolescents, 7,888 (34%) were tested for HIV viral load. The incidence rate of virological failure among those tested was 3.2 per 100 person-years follow-up and the rate of switching to second-line ART among all patients was 1.4 per 100 person-years follow-up. Factors associated with virological failure included: being adolescent; being lost to follow-up at least once; having WHO stage 3 and 4 at ART initiation; and having taken first-line ART elsewhere before coming to IHC. Of the 1032 patients who met virological failure criteria, 762 (74%) switched to second-line ART.We found high rates of virological failure among one third of patients in the cohort who were tested for viral load. Of those failing virologically on first-line ART, about one quarter were not switched to second-line ART. Routine viral load monitoring, especially for those identified as having a higher risk of treatment failure, should be considered in this setting to detect all patients failing on first-line ART. Strategies also need to be put in place to prevent treatment failure and to treat more of those patients who are actually failing."
https://openalex.org/W2587494419,"Circulating levels of bone-derived fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) increase early during acute and chronic kidney disease and are associated with adverse outcomes. Membrane-bound Klotho acts as a permissive coreceptor for FGF23, and its expression was recently found in osteoblasts/osteocytes. We hypothesized that Klotho in bone cells is part of an autocrine feedback loop that regulates FGF23 expression during renal failure. Thus, we induced renal failure in mice with targeted deletion of Klotho in long bones. Uremic wild-type (KLfl/fl ) and knockout (Prx1-Cre;KLfl/fl ) mice both responded with reduced body weight, kidney atrophy, hyperphosphatemia, and increased bone turnover. Importantly, long bones of Prx1-Cre;KLfl/fl mice but not their axial skeleton failed to increase FGF23 expression as observed in uremic KLfl/fl mice. Consequently, Prx1-Cre;KLfl/fl mice had significantly lower serum FGF23 and parathyroid hormone levels, and higher renal 1-α-hydroxylase expression, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and calcium levels than KLfl/fl mice. These results were confirmed in two independent models of renal failure, adenine diet induced and 5/6 nephrectomy. Moreover, FGF23-treated bone cells required Klotho to increase FGF23 mRNA and ERK phosphorylation. In summary, our novel findings show that Klotho in bone is crucial for inducing FGF23 production upon renal failure. We propose the presence of an autocrine feedback loop in which Klotho senses the need for FGF23.-Kaludjerovic, J., Komaba, H., Sato, T., Erben, R. G., Baron, R., Olauson, H., Larsson, T.

If and how risk attitudes vary with wealth remains an open question. Here humans accumulated reward by accepting or rejecting successive monetary gambles within arbitrarily defined temporal contexts. Risk preferences changed substantially toward risk aversion as reward accumulated within a context, and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) tracked the latent growth of cumulative economic outcomes.

These findings can be understood if humans have evolved economic decision policies that fail to maximize overall expected value but reduce variance in cumulative outcomes, thereby ensuring that resources remain above a critical survival threshold. Animals accumulate resources through repeated encounters with the world. In an uncertain environment, each encounter carries potential costs and benefits. For example, approaching a food item might expose a foraging animal to predation. The average resources accumulated over a fixed time period are maximized by engaging with encounters (or prospects) that have net positive expected value (i.e., those for which the likely benefits outweigh the likely costs) and avoiding all others. Thus, on average, a stockbroker maximizes weekly profit by investing in shares with positive return, even in a volatile stock market. However, humans and other animals are highly sensitive to the outcome variance, or risk, associated with the choice alternatives (Arrow, 1971Arrow K. Essays in the Theory of Risk Bearing.

When asked to judge everyday economic scenarios, humans often avoid risky prospects, including those with net positive expected value (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981Tversky A. Kahneman D. The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice.Science. 1981; 211: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (10121) Google Scholar). Classical theories argue that attitudes toward risk can be accounted for by nonlinearities in the function that maps economic outcomes onto internal estimates of value, or utility, while more recent accounts have extended this framework by applying subjective decision weights to prospects instead of face-value probabilities (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979Kahneman D.

However, humans and other animals are not always risk averse. Risk preferences may reverse if the potential gains and losses involved are relatively small (Prelec and Loewenstein, 1991Prelec D. Loewenstein G. Decision making over time and under uncertainty: a common approach.Manage. Sci. 1991; 37: 770-786Crossref Google Scholar), when outcomes are framed as losses rather than gains (De Martino et al., 2006De Martino B. Kumaran D. Seymour B. Dolan R.J. Frames, biases, and rational decision-making in the human brain.Science. 2006; 313: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), or when primary rather than secondary reinforcers are involved (Hayden and Platt, 2009Hayden B.Y.

Critically, attitudes toward risk also can change dynamically according to the abundance of resources in the environment and the current level of well-being (Losecaat Vermeer et al., 2014Losecaat Vermeer A.B.

USA. 2013; 110: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For example, in resource-scarce environments, where safe hunting options may yield average levels of return that are insufficient for survival, animals typically adopt risky strategies (Abrahams and Dill, 1989Abrahams M.V. Dill L.M. A determination of the energetic equivalence of the risk of predation.Ecology. 1989; 70: 999-1007Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Kolling et al., 2014Kolling N. Wittmann M.

One interpretation of these findings is that animals may have evolved decision policies that promote survival rather than simply seeking to maximize long-run average value of outcomes. An animal wishing to maximize its chances of survival should take risks when resources are scarce (because there is little to lose) but become risk averse when ample resources have been accumulated, because safe choices maximize the confidence that cumulative resources will remain above a fixed threshold (such as zero) (Mallpress et al., 2015Mallpress D.E.

Life-history trade-offs favour the evolution of animal personalities.Nature. 2007; 447: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). However, the so-called budget rule describing this switch in risk sensitivity has yielded inconsistent evidence in the animal literature (Kacelnik and El Mouden, 2013Kacelnik A. El Mouden C. Triumphs and trials of the risk paradigm.Anim. Behav. 2013; 86: 1117-1129Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In humans, one recent study observed increased risk-taking in order to achieve an externally imposed target, with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity in the medial prefrontal cortex scaling with the pressure to accept risky choices (Kolling et al., 2014Kolling N. Wittmann M. Rushworth M.F. Multiple neural mechanisms of decision making and their competition under changing risk pressure.Neuron. 2014; 81: 1190-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Another study showed violations of dynamic consistency in sequential choices, with the target value encoded in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Symmonds et al., 2010Symmonds M. Bossaerts P. Dolan R.J. A behavioral and neural evaluation of prospective decision-making under risk.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14380-14389Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, both studies involved target values below which all resources were lost. It remains unknown how humans track reward accumulation in the absence of such researcher-induced targets. In psychology and economics, the relationship between resource level, or wealth, and risk attitudes remains controversial. For instance, prospect theory posits that changes from the status quo matter more than the status quo itself. However, if the reference point, the key improvement of prospect theory over expected utility theory, is not defined as the status quo but rather as an aspiration level, the coding of gains and losses can reverse (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979Kahneman D. Tversky A. Prospect theory: an analysis of decision under risk.Econometrica. 1979; 47: 263-292Crossref Google Scholar). For instance, receiving $5 will feel like a gain to someone who expected $1 but like a loss to someone who expected $10, even though their final asset positions are identical. Evidence from the field is likewise inconsistent: For example, stock market participation increases with household wealth (Hong et al., 2004Hong H. Kubik J.D. Stein J.C. Social interaction and stock-market participation.J. Finance. 2004; 59: 137-163Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar), whereas troubled companies tend to take higher risks than their more affluent counterparts (Bowman, 1982Bowman E.H. Risk seeking by troubled firms.Sloan Manage. Rev. 1982; 23: 33-42Google Scholar, Kliger and Tsur, 2011Kliger D. Tsur I. Prospect theory and risk-seeking behavior by troubled firms.J. Behav. Finance. 2011; 12: 29-40Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, in laboratory experiments, the house money effect showed that risk-seeking is higher after a prior gain (Thaler and Johnson, 1990Thaler R.H. Johnson E.J. Gambling with the house money and trying to break even: the effects of prior outcomes on risky choice.Manage. Sci. 1990; 36: 643-660Crossref Google Scholar), and analysis of sequential decisions suggests that rewards often beget further risky choices (Hayden and Platt, 2009Hayden B.Y. Platt M.L. Gambling for Gatorade: risk-sensitive decision making for fluid rewards in humans.Anim. Cogn. 2009; 12: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but also can induce risk aversion (Gehring and Willoughby, 2002Gehring W.J. Willoughby A.R. The medial frontal cortex and the rapid processing of monetary gains and losses.Science. 2002; 295: 2279-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), whereas thirsty monkeys become less risk averse with approaching satiety (Yamada et al., 2013Yamada H. Tymula A. Louie K. Glimcher P.W. Thirst-dependent risk preferences in monkeys identify a primitive form of wealth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Multiple factors, including potentially uncontrolled economic factors in field studies (e.g., market liquidity) or differences in the evaluation of primary and secondary rewards in lab-based studies involving monkeys and humans, complicate the interpretation of these findings, and the descriptive relationship between risky behavior and reward accumulation thus remains unclear. Understanding the determinants of risk attitudes in humans and other species is an ongoing challenge in neuroscience, psychology, behavioral ecology, and economics (Arrow, 1971Arrow K.

Here we asked how human attitudes toward risk vary with the context provided by their current resource levels, or wealth, and how risky behavior is modulated by these variables at the neural level. If risk attitudes are to vary with resource levels, animals must be able to keep track of the cumulative reward they have obtained in a given behavioral context. To date, however, studies of the biology of economic decisions have largely focused on the neural response evoked by the expectation of a momentary outcome or its subsequent receipt (Bartra et al., 2013Bartra O.

Orbitofrontal cortex encodes willingness to pay in everyday economic transactions.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9984-9988Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). For example, many studies ask humans to repeatedly choose between consumer products (e.g., food items) or abstract symbols that predict monetary reward, offering a randomly selected chosen outcome at the end of the experiment. Much less is known about how estimates of cumulative reward are encoded over time in human brain signals. Here we designed a gambling task that, in conjunction with functional neuroimaging, allowed us to investigate how brain activity varies with cumulative reward over a discrete temporal context and to measure how risk attitudes change as resources are accumulated. We found that regions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that encoded momentary outcomes also tracked the accumulated level of resources encoded over each temporal context. Finally, we used computational simulations to understand these data, comparing the ability of both standard econometric accounts (such as prospect theory) and novel models to capture human behavior. Surprisingly, the model that provided the best quantitative account of resource-varying risk attitudes was inspired by work in perceptual decision-making, and it posits that the weight (or gain) associated with decision information is adjusted dynamically according to the local context (Cheadle et al., 2014Cheadle S.

Adaptive gain control during human perceptual choice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 1429-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the current task, the model proposes that the function that maps subjective utility onto a risky choice adapts as resources accumulate. Our theoretical explanation for changing risk attitudes with wealth thus concurs with recent proposals that the coding of sensory signals and economic value can be understood by shared principles of normalization and adaptive gain control (Louie et al., 2013Louie K. Khaw M.W. Glimcher P.W.

De Martino B. Camerer C. A range-normalization model of context-dependent choice: a new model and evidence.PLoS Comput Biol. 2012; 8: e1002607Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On each trial, human volunteers (n = 20) decided whether to accept or reject a risky gamble. The relative likelihood of winning or losing (reward probability) and the amount that could be won or lost (reward magnitude) were fully disclosed by a central display (Figure 1A). Reject choices led to a small but certain loss. On each of five blocks of 75 trials (scanner runs), decisions were made in successive temporal contexts (n = 5 within each scanner run) that were signaled by the color of information on the screen. Participants were told that their cumulative winnings in each context would be entered into a pot of the corresponding color (visible at the top of the screen) and that, upon completion of the experiment, one of the pots in each scanner run would be chosen pseudo-randomly in a lottery procedure and awarded as a financial bonus for participation. Upon completion of a context, the amount entered into the pot was displayed beneath the corresponding colored disc and remained visible for the remainder of the scanner run. However, cumulative reward associated with an ongoing context was not signaled to the participants, but it had to be estimated from the recent trial history. Contexts were of variable length (range 3–22 trials), but the number of remaining trials in the context was signaled to participants via a countdown signal on each trial (see Figure 1A). The reward-maximizing policy for this task was simply to accept gambles with positive net value and reject the others, ignoring the temporal context. For more details of the task and lottery, see the STAR Methods. Participants elected to gamble on 54.9% (SD = 11.9%) of trials, with a mean response time of 961 (SD = 169) ms. We used a logistic regression approach to identify predictors of human decisions to accept the risky option (i.e., to gamble; see Figure 1B). As predicted by economic theories, the expected value (EV) of a gamble was a strong positive predictor of acceptance (t19 = 17.67, p < 1 × 10−12) in regression model 1 (RM1). Over and above this, however, cumulative reward, the sum of all outcomes obtained thus far in the temporal context, was a negative predictor of the tendency to gamble (t19 = −4.06, p < 0.001, RM1). In other words, the more participants’ estimates of accumulated reward grew within a context, the less likely they were to choose the risky option (Figure 1F). However, when controlling for several additional variables in regression model 2 (RM2, see the STAR Methods), it became clear that this was not simply driven by changing preferences over time, as the overall trial number within a context (t19 = 0.003, p > 0.99, RM2) or trials elapsed within the scanner run of 75 trials (t19 = 0.76, p > 0.45, RM2) had no impact on risk preferences. Nor was the tendency to gamble influenced by proximity to the forthcoming context or by any interactions thereof (all p values > 0.14, RM2). Thus, decisions depended on economic factors alone, including latent estimates of the current level of resources, or wealth, rather than the passage of time elapsed across the experiment. Importantly, there was no effect of accumulated reward over the five contexts (t19 = −1.06, p > 0.30, RM2), indicating that participants treated each context as a unique behavioral episode. In addition, there was no significant interaction between wealth and scanning runs elapsed, indicating that the effect of wealth was stable over the five scanning runs (t19 = 0.36, p > 0.72, RM2) (Figure S1). Overall, the risk (outcome variance; Equation 10) associated with each gamble did not influence choices (t19 = −0.005, p > 0.99, RM1). However, we observed an interaction between risk and cumulative reward, such that participants became more risk averse with reward accumulation, as displayed by a tendency to select the safe option (t19 = −3.14, p < 0.01, RM1). The risk aversion bias following reward accumulation also was observed at the level of successive trials, when mean responses were compared as a function of the immediately preceding outcome (Figure 1C). Unlike humans and monkeys gambling for liquid reward (Hayden and Platt, 2009Hayden B.Y. Platt M.L. Gambling for Gatorade: risk-sensitive decision making for fluid rewards in humans.Anim. Cogn. 2009; 12: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), our participants eschewed a win-stay, lose-switch strategy, and they were instead less (not more) likely to gamble on the trial following a positive outcome (t19 = −3.54, p < 0.005, RM1). In a subsequent analysis, we plotted how choices mapped onto the expected value of each gamble, separately for trials where accumulated reward was higher or lower (within-participant median split). Psychometric functions were shifted toward safe choices following higher reward accumulation, as indicated by a nonparametric test on the inflection point of a best-fitting sigmoid function (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.005). By contrast, there was no difference in slope (p > 0.65) for the psychometric functions (Figures 1D and 1E). Taken together, these behavioral data show that human attitudes toward risk varied dynamically during resource accumulation, with risky choices giving way to safe choices as wealth gradually accumulated. In other words, cumulative reward (across an arbitrarily defined temporal context) is a critical factor determining attitudes toward risk in human economic decisions. We began by measuring how the brain responded to the receipt of momentary reward, correlating BOLD signals with the monetary outcome received (general linear model [GLM1]; Figure 2A; Table S1). As anticipated, this analysis strongly implicated structures including the ventral striatum (left peak [x,y,z]: −14, 12, −6; right peak: 14, 12, −6) and a rostral portion of the medial prefrontal cortex; for consistency with the past literature, we call this the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (sub-peak: −2, 52, −2). Note, however, that the peaks in striatum and vmPFC belong to one large cluster and are reported to aid understanding of the cluster’s spatial extent. These reported peaks, and all others reported throughout the Results, were situated within clusters of voxels that survived correction for multiple comparisons using a clusterwise false discovery rate (FDR) approach (Chumbley and Friston, 2009Chumbley J.R. Friston K.J. False discovery rate revisited: FDR and topological inference using Gaussian random fields.Neuroimage. 2009; 44: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, Genovese et al., 2002Genovese C.R. Lazar N.A. Nichols T. Thresholding of statistical maps in functional neuroimaging using the false discovery rate.Neuroimage. 2002; 15: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar). However, in order for risk preferences to vary with accumulated wealth in our task, the brain must have access to a latent variable encoding the current level of resources. Thus, we next asked whether the vmPFC BOLD signal tracks estimates of accumulated reward over the course of each temporal context. In GLM1, we also included a competing regressor encoding the sum of all outcomes obtained across the temporal context. This regressor encoded cumulative reward up to and including the immediately preceding trial, but not the current trial, and was thus orthogonal to the predictor based on momentary outcome. This regressor also captured unique variance in the vmPFC BOLD signal (Figure 2B), with a peak in a slightly more dorsofrontal region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (−6, 64, 2), as well as in the striatum (left peak: −14, 24, −2; right peak: 10, 20, 2). Both of these clusters survived FDR correction for multiple comparisons. The portion of the vmPFC that responded to current trial outcome and that which responded to accumulated reward were overlapping (Figures 2A and 2B). Indeed, voxels within the vmPFC that responded to outcome at a threshold of p < 0.001 (uncorrected) were also, on average, sensitive to cumulative reward (t19 = 3.18, p < 0.005), even when regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in a leave-one-out fashion over participants to avoid potentially circular inference. We also observed responses to accumulated reward in the left angular gyrus (peak: −54, −60, 30) and unexpected areas, such as the right occipital lobe (38, −92, 14); a full list of activations is described in Table S2. Risk preferences during economic judgments are often characterized using prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979Kahneman D. Tversky A. Prospect theory: an analysis of decision under risk.Econometrica. 1979; 47: 263-292Crossref Google Scholar), a descriptive model of how losses, gains, and probabilities are weighted before being combined to form a subjective internal estimate (expected utility). In prospect theory, the"

The aim of this study was to determine whether ACR and/or GLY have any detrimental effect on the meiotic cell division of oocytes. For this purpose, germinal vesicle-stage mouse oocytes were treated with 0, 100, 500, or 1000 μM ACR or 0, 25, or 250 μM GLY in vitro. In vivo experiments were performed after an intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg/day ACR of female BALB/c mice for 7 days. The majority of in vitro ACR-treated oocytes reached the metaphase-II stage following 18 hours of incubation, which was not significantly different from the control group. Maturation of the oocytes derived from in vivo ACR-treated mice was impaired significantly. Oocytes, reaching the M-II stage in the in vivo ACR-treated group, were characterized by a decrease in meiotic spindle mass and an increase in chromosomal disruption. In vitro GLY treatment resulted in the degeneration of all oocytes, indicating that ACR toxicity on female germ cells may occur through its metabolite, GLY. Thus, ACR exposure must be considered, together with its metabolite GLY, when female fertility is concerned."

This study presented the first tree-ring stable carbon isotope (δ13C) and iWUE series of Pinus massoniana from 1865 to 2013 in Fujian province, humid subtropical China, and the first tree-ring width standard chronology during the period of 1836–2013 for the Niumulin Nature Reserve (NML). Tree-ring width growth was limited by precipitation in July-August (r = 0.40, p < 0.01). The tree-ring carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) was mainly controlled by the sunshine hours (r = -0.66, p < 0.001) and relative humidity (r = 0.58, p < 0.001) in September-October, a season with rapid latewood formation in this area. The iWUE increased by 42.6% and the atmospheric CO2 concentration (ca) explained 92.6% of the iWUE variance over the last 150 years. The steady increase in iWUE suggests an active response with a proportional increase in intercellular CO2 concentration (ci) in response to increase in ca. The contribution of iWUE to tree growth in the study region is not conspicuous, which points to influences of other factors such as climate."

We show that 16: 4(n-3) exerts its effect by activating splenic F4/80+/CD11blow macrophages, which results in production of chemoprotective lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). Pharmacologic studies, together with analysis of expression patterns, identified GPR120 on F4/80+/CD11blow macrophages as the relevant receptor for 16: 4(n-3). Studies that used splenocytes from GPR120-deficient mice have confirmed this conclusion. Activation of the 16: 4(n-3)-GPR120 axis led to enhanced cPLA2 activity in these splenic macrophages and secretion of the resistance-inducing lipid mediator, lysophosphatidylcholine(24: 1).

However, the effects of acute high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and sprint interval exercise (SIE) on activation of these signaling pathways are unclear. Methods Eight young and recreationally active adults performed a single cycling session of HIIE (5 x 4 minutes at 75% Wmax), SIE (4 x 30 second Wingate sprints), and continuous moderate-intensity exercise work-matched to HIIE (CMIE; 30 minutes at 50% of Wmax), separated by a minimum of 1 week. Skeletal muscle SAPK and insulin protein signaling were measured immediately, and 3 hours after exercise. Results SIE elicited greater skeletal muscle NF-κB p65 phosphorylation immediately after exercise (SIE: ~40%; HIIE: ~4%; CMIE; ~13%; p < 0.05) compared to HIIE and CMIE. AS160Ser588 phosphorylation decreased immediately after HIIE (~-27%; p < 0.05), and decreased to the greatest extent immediately after SIE (~-60%; p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle JNK (~42%; p < 0.05) and p38 MAPK (~171%; p < 0.05) phosphorylation increased, and skeletal muscle AktSer473 phosphorylation (~-32%; p < 0.05) decreased, to a similar extent immediately after all exercise protocols.

https://openalex.org/W2586460703,"Salinity is the primary driver of osmoregulatory evolution in decapods, and may have influenced their diversification into different osmotic niches. In semi-terrestrial crabs, hyper-osmoregulatory ability favors sojourns into burrows and dilute media, and provides a safeguard against hemolymph dilution; hypo-osmoregulatory ability underlies emersion capability and a life more removed from water sources. However, most comparative studies have neglected the roles of the phylogenetic and environmental components of inter-specific physiological variation, hindering evaluation of phylogenetic patterns and the adaptive nature of osmoregulatory evolution. Semi-terrestrial fiddler crabs (Uca) inhabit fresh to hyper-saline waters, with species from the Americas occupying higher intertidal habitats than Indo-west Pacific species mainly found in the low intertidal zone. Here, we characterize numerous osmoregulatory traits in all ten fiddler crabs found along the Atlantic coast of Brazil, and we employ phylogenetic comparative methods using 24 species to test for: (i) similarities of osmoregulatory ability among closely related species; (ii) salinity as a driver of osmoregulatory evolution; (iii) correlation between salt uptake and secretion; and (iv) adaptive peaks in osmoregulatory ability in the high intertidal American lineages. Our findings reveal that osmoregulation in Uca exhibits strong phylogenetic patterns in salt uptake traits. Salinity does not correlate with hyper/hypo-regulatory abilities, but drives hemolymph osmolality at ambient salinities. Osmoregulatory traits have evolved towards three adaptive peaks, revealing a significant contribution of hyper/hypo-regulatory ability in the American clades. Thus, during the evolutionary history of fiddler crabs, salinity has driven some of the osmoregulatory transformations that underpin habitat diversification, although others are apparently constrained phylogenetically."
https://openalex.org/W2587206971,"Purpose During their early years at medical school, students repeatedly criticize their workload, time constraints and test associated stress. At the same time, depressiveness and anxiety among first and second year medical students are on the rise. We therefore hypothesized that test anxiety may be related to depressiveness and considered cognitive and academic performances as confounders for the former and psychosocial distress for the latter. Methods A whole class of 200 second year students was invited to participate in the study. Anxiety as a trait, depressiveness, crystallized intelligence, verbal fluency and psychosocial distress were assessed using validated tests and questionnaires. Acute state anxiety and sympathetic stress parameters were measured in real life situations immediately before an oral and a written exam and paired tests were used to compare the individual anxieties at the various time points. Previous academic performances were self-reported, the results of the impending exams were monitored. Finally, correlations were performed to test for interrelatedness between academic performances and the various personal, cognitive and psychosocial factors. Results Acute test anxiety did not correlate with depressiveness nor did it correlate with previous nor impending academic performances nor any of the expected confounders on academic performance. However both, depressiveness and test anxiety strongly correlated with the perceived imbalance between efforts spent and rewards received. Moreover, anxiety as a trait not only correlated with acute state anxiety before an exam but was also significantly correlated to the feeling of over-commitment. Conclusion Depressiveness during the early years of medical school seems unrelated to test anxiety and academic performance. Instead, it strongly correlated with the psychosocial distress emanating from attending medical school and points at a perceived imbalance between efforts spent and rewards received."
https://openalex.org/W2586101801,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are key natural biopolymers that exhibit a range of biological functions including growth and differentiation. Despite this multiplicity of function, natural GAG sequences have not yielded drugs because of problems of heterogeneity and synthesis. Recently, several homogenous non-saccharide glycosaminoglycan mimetics (NSGMs) have been reported as agents displaying major therapeutic promise. Yet, it remains unclear whether sulfated NSGMs structurally mimic sulfated GAGs. To address this, we developed a three-step molecular dynamics (MD)-based algorithm to compare sulfated NSGMs with GAGs. In the first step of this algorithm, parameters related to the range of conformations sampled by the two highly sulfated molecules as free entities in water were compared. The second step compared identity of binding site geometries and the final step evaluated comparable dynamics and interactions in the protein-bound state. Using a test case of interactions with fibroblast growth factor-related proteins, we show that this three-step algorithm effectively predicts the GAG structure mimicking property of NSGMs. Specifically, we show that two unique dimeric NSGMs mimic hexameric GAG sequences in the protein-bound state. In contrast, closely related monomeric and trimeric NSGMs do not mimic GAG in either the free or bound states. These results correspond well with the functional properties of NSGMs. The results show for the first time that appropriately designed sulfated NSGMs can be good structural mimetics of GAGs and the incorporation of a MD-based strategy at the NSGM library screening stage can identify promising mimetics of targeted GAG sequences."

In the inflamed colon of humans and mice, we found decreased levels of mitochondrial complex cytochrome c oxidase I/IV and lower ATP levels. Thus, we generated colonic ρ0 cells with reduced mitochondrial function linked to ATP production by selective depletion of mitochondrial DNA. In these cells, RNA sequencing revealed a substantial number of differentially expressed transcripts, among which 240 belonged to inflammatory pathways activated in human inflamed colon and TNF-α-treated cells (false discovery rate < 0.05). TNF-α treatment of colonic ρ0 cells augmented IL-8 expression by 9-fold (P < 0.01) via NF-κB compared to TNF-α-treated control. Moreover, reduced mitochondrial function facilitated TNF-α-mediated NF-κB luciferase promoter activity as a result of lowered inhibitory IκBα (nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell inhibitor, α), leading to elevated NF-κB. In cells with reduced mitochondrial function, TNF-α facilitated AMPKα2 activation by 8-fold (P < 0.01), which was involved in NF-κB-dependent IL-8 expression. Last, in human and mouse colon, anti-TNF-α treatment restored reduced mitochondria-dependent inflammation.

Methods We included 41 very-low-birth-weight and 64 term infants. Anthropometry was performed at all visits to the outpatient clinic. IGF-I and insulin were measured in blood samples taken at 6 months and 2 years corrected age (very-low-birth-weight children) and at 3 months, 1 and 2 years (term children). Results Over the first 2 years of life growth parameters are lower in very-low-birth-weight children compared to term children, but the difference in length decreases significantly. During the first 2 years of life IGF-I is higher in very-low-birth-weight children compared to term children. In both groups there is a significant relationship between IGF-I and (change in) length and weight over the first 2 years of life and between insulin and change in total body fat.

It is not known whether CKD is an independent risk factor for mortality in older post-MI patients with optimal cardiovascular drug-treatment. Therefore, we studied the relation between kidney function and all-cause and specific mortality among older post-MI patients, without severe heart failure, who are treated with state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy. From 2002–2006, 4,561 Dutch post-MI patients were enrolled and followed until death or January 2012. We estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) with cystatin C (cysC) and creatinine (cr) using the CKD-EPI equations and analyzed the relation with any and major causes of death using Cox models and restricted cubic splines. Mean (SD) for age was 69 years (5.6), 79% were men, 17% smoked, 21% had diabetes, 90% used antihypertensive drugs, 98% used antithrombotic drugs and 85% used statins. Patients were divided into four categories of baseline eGFRcysC: ≥90 (33%; reference), 60–89 (47%), 30–59 (18%), and <30 (2%) ml/min/1.73m2. Median follow-up was 6.4 years. During follow-up, 873 (19%) patients died: 370 (42%) from cardiovascular causes, 309 (35%) from cancer, and 194 (22%) from other causes. After adjustment for age, sex and classic cardiovascular risk factor, hazard ratios (95%-confidence intervals) for any death according to the four eGFRcysC categories were: 1 (reference), 1.4 (1.1–1.7), 2.9 (2.3–3.6) and 4.4 (3.0–6.4). The hazard ratios of all-cause and cause-specific mortality increased linearly below kidney functions of 80 ml/min/1.73 m2. Weaker results were obtained for eGFRcr. To conclude, we found in optimal cardiovascular drug-treated post-MI patients an inverse graded relation between kidney function and mortality for both cardiovascular as well as non-cardiovascular causes. Risk of mortality increased linearly below kidney function of about 80 ml/min/1.73 m2."
https://openalex.org/W2586653334,"The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between alternative anaerobic capacity method (MAODALT) and a 30-s all-out tethered running test. Fourteen male recreational endurance runners underwent a graded exercise test, a supramaximal exhaustive effort and a 30-s all-out test on different days, interspaced by 48h. After verification of data normality (Shapiro-Wilk test), the Pearson’s correlation test was used to verify the association between the anaerobic estimates from the MAODALT and the 30-s all-out tethered running outputs. Absolute MAODALT was correlated with mean power (r = 0.58; P = 0.03), total work (r = 0.57; P = 0.03), and mean force (r = 0.79; P = 0.001). In addition, energy from the glycolytic pathway (E[La-]) was correlated with mean power (r = 0.58; P = 0.03). Significant correlations were also found at each 5s interval between absolute MAODALT and force values (r between 0.75 and 0.84), and between force values and E[La-] (r between 0.73 to 0.80). In conclusion, the associations between absolute MAODALT and the mechanical outputs from the 30-s all-out tethered running test evidenced the importance of the anaerobic capacity for maintaining force during the course of time in short efforts."

Here, we evaluated genes involved in the TLR signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative metabolism, aiming to assess their interactions and resulting cell functions and pathways that are disturbed in septic patients.Blood samples were obtained from 16 patients with sepsis secondary to community acquired pneumonia at admission (D0), and after 7 days (D7, N = 10) of therapy. Samples were also collected from 8 healthy volunteers who were matched according to age and gender. Gene expression of 84 genes was performed by real-time polymerase chain reactions. Their expression was considered up- or down-regulated when the fold change was greater than 1.5 compared to the healthy volunteers. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.Twenty-two genes were differently expressed in D0 samples; most of them were down-regulated. When gene expression was analyzed according to the outcomes, higher number of altered genes and a higher intensity in the disturbance was observed in non-survivor than in survivor patients. The canonical pathways altered in D0 samples included interferon and iNOS signaling; the role of JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 in interferon signaling; mitochondrial dysfunction; and superoxide radical degradation pathways. When analyzed according to outcomes, different pathways were disturbed in surviving and non-surviving patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and superoxide radical degradation pathway were among the most altered in non-surviving patients.Our data show changes in the expression of genes belonging to the interacting TLR cascades, NADPH-oxidase and oxidative phosphorylation. Importantly, distinct patterns are clearly observed in surviving and non-surviving patients. Interferon signaling, marked by changes in JAK-STAT modulation, had prominent changes in both survivors and non-survivors, whereas the redox imbalance (iNOS signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and superoxide radical degradation) affecting mitochondrial functions was prominent in non-surviving patients."

Decades of genetic studies on neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), have revealed genetic disruptions to a variety of processes that maintain neuronal health and promote circuit assembly. In fact, ASD and ID likely comprise a constellation of disorders with distinct genetic causes, each affecting neurons in different ways. Several hundred genes have now been implicated in ASD with varying degrees of certainty. Functional analyses in cell lines and animal models have begun to define possible gene categories and shared molecular deficits across ASD genes, often identifying broad regulatory functions. Much of our understanding of the physiological and molecular correlates of ASD come from studies of syndromic conditions, where ASD is accompanied by ID and other neurological or clinical findings. This work has identified disruptions in the regulation of global gene transcription and protein synthesis in several forms of syndromic ASD, which has led to the hypothesis that a key cause of ASD and ID may be the disruption in homeostatic control of neuronal function, i.e., the ability of a neuron to reliably respond to electrical and molecular stimuli and return to a set point (Sztainberg and Zoghbi, 2016Sztainberg Y. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1408-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In a recent set of studies, Gaia Novarino and colleagues have identified a critical role for amino acid homeostasis in ASD, ID, and seizures (Novarino et al., 2012Novarino G. El-Fishawy P. Kayserili H. Meguid N.A. Scott E.M. Schroth J. Silhavy J.L. Kara M. Khalil R.O.

Amino acids are the building blocks of every protein in the cell, but they are also used as neurotransmitters and as metabolic intermediates in multiple pathways. By studying two related forms of syndromic ASD—one caused by mutations in branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) (Novarino et al., 2012Novarino G. El-Fishawy P. Kayserili H. Meguid N.A. Scott E.M. Schroth J. Silhavy J.L. Kara M. Khalil R.O. Ben-Omran T. et al.Science. 2012; 338: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and a second caused by a mutation in a component of the large neutral amino acid trasporter 1 (LAT1), SLC7A5 (Figure 1A) (Tărlungeanu et al., 2016Tărlungeanu D.C. Deliu E. Dotter C.P. Kara M. Janiesch P.C. Scalise M. Galluccio M. Tesulov M. Morelli E. Sonmez F.M. et al.Cell. 2016; 167: 1481-1494.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)—these studies showed how levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are critical for neuronal health. BCAAs, which include leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are essential amino acids that comprise as much as 30% of proteins. They are metabolized in the liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue via a multi-step process, leading to acetoacetate, acetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA, which are critical for ATP production (Figure 1B). After the initial transamination of BCAAs to branched-chain ketoacids (BCKAs), BCKDK controls activity of the second enzyme in BCAA metabolism, the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC). LAT1 in turn controls brain levels of both BCAAs and large neutral amino acids, including tyrosine and phenylalanine, which are precursors of serotonin and catecholamines. Thus, by affecting protein synthesis, energy production, and neurotransmitter balance, disruption of BCAA levels by BCKDK and SLC7A5 (LAT1) mutations has far-reaching implications for survival and function of several neuronal circuits. Since BCAAs can be supplemented or removed from the diet, this finding suggests that there may be a subset of ASD cases that is treatable by simple dietary interventions. The importance of controlled BCAA levels during brain development first became evident in a severe metabolic condition, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), so called because of the distinct syrupy, burnt sugar smell of urine from the affected infants. MSUD is caused by mutations decreasing activity of BCKDC, preventing ketoacid breakdown, and greatly increasing levels of both BCAAs and BCKAs. Accumulation of leucine, in particular, is extremely neurotoxic through multiple mechanisms. As LAT1 is an obligate 1:1 exchanger, coupling one amino acid influx with one amino acid efflux (Figure 1A), hyperleucinemia causes an imbalance in other essential amino acids, including glutamate, and reduces dopamine and serotonin tone. In addition, osmotic dysregulation can cause brain edema. The most severe forms of MSUD present a few days after birth with convulsions, ketoacidosis, and acute encephalopathy and, if untreated, progress to coma and death. Reduced BCAA infant formula or liver transplant to restore BCAA metabolism have proven effective, but even with treatment, MSUD confers a high risk of ID and multiple psychiatric presentations, including depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Muelly et al., 2013Muelly E.R.

These findings suggest that inability to maintain homeostasis of BCAA levels in the brain may lead to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. The identification of BCKDK mutations in families with ASD, ID, and seizures showed that lower BCAA levels could also be deleterious for brain development. Loss of BCKDK leads to amino acid imbalance in the brain of Bckdk knockout (KO) mice (Novarino et al., 2012Novarino G. El-Fishawy P. Kayserili H. Meguid N.A. Scott E.M. Schroth J. Silhavy J.L. Kara M. Khalil R.O. Ben-Omran T. et al.Science. 2012; 338: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with BCKDK mutations (García-Cazorla et al., 2014García-Cazorla A. Oyarzabal A. Fort J. Robles C. Castejón E. Ruiz-Sala P. Bodoy S. Merinero B. Lopez-Sala A. Dopazo J. et al.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Bckdk KO mice have motor deficits, including abnormal gait and hindlimb clasping, which can be rescued with BCAA-enriched diet. Initial tests in one patient with BCKDK mutations have shown promising results (García-Cazorla et al., 2014García-Cazorla A. Oyarzabal A. Fort J. Robles C. Castejón E. Ruiz-Sala P. Bodoy S. Merinero B. Lopez-Sala A. Dopazo J. et al.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a recent article published in Cell, Tărlungeanu et al., 2016Tărlungeanu D.C. Deliu E. Dotter C.P. Kara M. Janiesch P.C. Scalise M. Galluccio M. Tesulov M. Morelli E. Sonmez F.M. et al.Cell. 2016; 167: 1481-1494.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar identified another disruption in this pathway caused by mutations in the LAT1 subunit SLC7A5 in patients affected by ASD, microcephaly, and psychomotor delay. Unlike Bckdk, Slc7a5 is primarily found in the endothelial cells that form the vasculature of the mature brain. As the brain matures, endothelial cells come together to form the robust vascular structures of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which controls the flow of amino acids and other nutrients into the brain. Complete Slc7a5 loss of function is embryonically lethal, suggesting an essential function throughout development and in other tissues. To bypass embryonic lethality and explore the role of Slc7a5 in amino acid trafficking through the BBB, Tărlungeanu et al., 2016Tărlungeanu D.C. Deliu E. Dotter C.P. Kara M. Janiesch P.C. Scalise M.

Sonmez F.M. et al.Cell. 2016; 167: 1481-1494.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar used a conditional approach to specifically ablate the gene in endothelial cells (Slc7a5 cKO). During early postnatal development, when the vasculature is still “leaky,” deletion of Slc7a5 had virtually no observable defects. However, as the brain matured, a severe reduction of BCAAs was observed, similar to the Bckdk KO mice. Interestingly, BCAA levels began to decline in correspondence with an increase in histidine, which may participate in the 1:1 exchange flowing through LAT1 opposite to BCAAs. Histidine increases as much as 3-fold in the adult brain, but it remains unclear whether this causes any molecular deficits. Slc7a5 cKO mice perform poorly on tests of social interaction and show impairments in gait and motor coordination that are suggestive of a broader ASD-related syndrome, similar to that observed with BCKDK/Bckdk mutations (García-Cazorla et al., 2014García-Cazorla A. Oyarzabal A. Fort J. Robles C. Castejón E. Ruiz-Sala P. Bodoy S. Merinero B. Lopez-Sala A. Dopazo J. et al.Hum.

Ben-Omran T. et al.Science. 2012; 338: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Intraventricular injection of leucine and isoleucine in the brain of Slc7a5 cKO mice was able to rescue the motor deficits, but further studies will be needed to address how this treatment affects social behavior. Slc7a5 deficiency was also associated with anomalies in cortical neuron function, including increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory miniature synaptic events, and a measurable decrease in presumptive inhibitory synaptic vesicles. Thus, reduced BCAA influx caused by mutations in either BCKDK or SLC7A5 causes motor and social deficits in both mice and humans. BCAA supplementation deserves further testing as an intervention to rescue psychomotor phenotypes associated with ASD. Since faulty amino acid homeostasis can wreak havoc on the brain through a variety of mechanisms, Tărlungeanu et al., 2016Tărlungeanu D.C. Deliu E. Dotter C.P. Kara M. Janiesch P.C. Scalise M. Galluccio M. Tesulov M. Morelli E. Sonmez F.M. et al.Cell. 2016; 167: 1481-1494.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar started their functional studies by assessing global changes in transcription in the Slc7a5 mutant brain. The results showed a series of cellular responses to the lack of specific amino acids, including the upregulation of other amino acid transporters. Upregulation of other transporters with overlapping affinity may help to blunt the effects of Slc7a5 loss of function, limiting the extent of the amino acid deficiency. These changes fall into the general category of the cellular amino acid response (AAR) mechanism, which represents the cellular attempt to compensate for amino acid starvation (Figures 1C and 1D). When confronted with a lack of nutrients, a cell can react by engaging several overlapping mechanisms. Since BCAAs cannot be produced by mammals, cells are forced to regulate other aspects of cellular metabolism and function, limiting energy usage, modulating production and degradation of proteins and organelles, or, in the most extreme case, committing cellular suicide (apoptosis). The Slc7a5 cKO brain displays one of these key responses: blocking the initiation of cap-dependent protein translation (Figure 1E). This post-transcriptional slowdown in the production of proteins is shown by assessing the fraction of RNA bound to ribosomes (polysomes). In the mutant brains, less mRNA is bound to actively translating ribosomes, suggesting that brain cells are restricting amino acid usage by slowing protein synthesis. This phenomenon appears to be signaled by the activation of the “General Control Non-derepressible 2” (GCN2) pathway, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of a modulator of translation, eIF2α. GCN2 is activated by the overabundance of uncharged transfer RNA (tRNA)—a signal that there are insufficient amino acid building blocks for protein translation (Figure 1D). While the GCN2 pathway is an important response mechanism for amino acid starvation, it is not the only one. Thus, it is somewhat surprising that there was no evidence of changes in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the other canonical response pathway for amino acid deficiency (Figure 1C). In particular, a protein complex—referred to as mTORC1—is known as a key response for multiple stressors, including nutrient starvation, by acting as a sort of “throttle” for cellular metabolism. Previous work has shown that a reduction in leucine reduces the activation of Sestrin 2, a leucine-dependent mTOR activator, causing a robust reduction in mTORC1 signaling (Wolfson et al., 2016Wolfson R.L. Chantranupong L. Saxton R.A. Shen K. Scaria S.M. Cantor J.R. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2016; 351: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). However, despite a clear reduction in leucine, Slc7a5 cKO brains showed no changes to the phosphorylation of p70-S6K, a canonical readout of mTORC1 signaling. While there was a change in the phosphorylation of a second mTORC1 target, eIF4EBP1, this lack of canonical mTOR signaling is confounding. Previous work has suggested that the GCN2 pathway significantly overlaps with the mTOR pathway—and, in fact, GCN2 activation can repress mTORC1 (Averous et al., 2016Averous J. Lambert-Langlais S. Mesclon F. Carraro V. Parry L. Jousse C. Bruhat A. Maurin A.-C. Pierre P. Proud C.G. Fafournoux P. Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 27698Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the response to cellular starvation is robust, but it does not involve the “usual suspects.” The mechanisms by which mTORC1 signaling is left unscathed by Slc7a5 removal in the BBB remain to be defined. One possibility is that aspects of the response to amino acid deficiency may be largely invisible to transcriptional profiling. mTOR signaling, GCN2, and other cellular stress signaling pathways are primarily “phosphorylation cascades,” with their effects mediated by activated kinases phosphorylating and activating other downstream kinases in a transient manner. Alternatively, the cellular response observed in the brain may be a peculiarity that is not readily predicted by the numerous previous studies of amino acid signaling that were performed in cell lines or model systems such as yeast. Neurons and glia are metabolically quite distinct from transformed cells or cells derived from other tissues. Since neurons are non-proliferating cells, their cellular stress responses to amino acid starvation and subsequent mTOR activation could be different from those of proliferating cells. Protein translation disruptions have been described in multiple models of syndromic ASD (Santini and Klann, 2014Santini E. Klann E. Sci. Signal. 2014; 7: re10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but these are usually seen alongside alterations in the mTOR pathway. Some of the best studied models of syndromic ASD are the so-called “Tor-opathies,” where mTOR signaling intermediates are genetically disrupted, but unlike in the brain of Slc7a5 cKO mice, these mutations lead to an uncontrolled increase in protein translation. This link between syndromic ASD and increased translation is also observed in several other genetic models of ASD that do not directly engage the mTOR signaling pathway, including Fmr1 mutation (Fragile X syndrome) and eIF4BP2 deletion, suggesting that dysregulated translation may be central to ASD-relevant behavioral deficits (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C. Hung K.Y.S. Mele A. Fraser C.E. Stone E.F. Chen C. Fak J.J. Chi S.W. et al.Cell. 2011; 146: 247-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, Gkogkas et al., 2013Gkogkas C.G. Khoutorsky A. Ran I. Rampakakis E. Nevarko T. Weatherill D.B. Vasuta C. Yee S. Truitt M. Dallaire P. et al.Nature. 2013; 493: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In fact, the linkage between uncontrolled translation and ASD is strong enough that pharmacological inhibitors of translation are being considered as targets for intervention for multiple forms of ASD (Crunkhorn, 2013Crunkhorn S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The identification of reduced translation in the brain of Slc7a5 cKO mice raises the possibility that too much or too little protein synthesis may lead to similar phenotypes. One possible explanation is that the focus on the immediate signaling response to BCAA deficiency overlooks other downstream consequences of amino acid starvation, such as the production of defective proteins. In fact, amino acid starvation may share a common pathology with the uncontrolled over-translation of proteins seen in other ASD models. When essential amino acids are lacking, the defective cell machinery is unable to provide necessary aminoacyl-tRNAs in sufficient amounts to meet synthetic demand, leading to translation errors. If such defective proteins begin to accumulate, it could trigger other stress responses that are distinct from mTOR signaling, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR). It is possible that the numerous disruptions identified in syndromic forms of ASD are inhibiting the normal cellular responses that protect the integrity of protein translation, although by diverse means. In conclusion, the discovery that defects in amino acid homeostasis and metabolism are linked to ASD identified an easily manipulation via dietary supplementation, which should be investigated in other forms of syndromic and non-syndromic ASD. The molecular mechanisms by which reduced BCAA levels disrupt motor function and social behavior remain poorly understood. This work from Tărlungeanu et al., 2016Tărlungeanu D.C. Deliu E. Dotter C.P.

Precision is crucial for correct staging and clinical decision-making. Navigation and multimodal imaging can potentially improve EBUS-TBNA efficiency. Aims To demonstrate the feasibility of a multimodal image guiding system using electromagnetic navigation for ultrasound bronchoschopy in humans. Methods Four patients referred for lung cancer diagnosis and staging with EBUS-TBNA were enrolled in the study. Target lymph nodes were predefined from the preoperative computed tomography (CT) images. A prototype convex probe ultrasound bronchoscope with an attached sensor for position tracking was used for EBUS-TBNA. Electromagnetic tracking of the ultrasound bronchoscope and ultrasound images allowed fusion of preoperative CT and intraoperative ultrasound in the navigation software. Navigated EBUS-TBNA was used to guide target lymph node localization and sampling. Navigation system accuracy was calculated, measured by the deviation between lymph node position in ultrasound and CT in three planes. Procedure time, diagnostic yield and adverse events were recorded. Results Preoperative CT and real-time ultrasound images were successfully fused and displayed in the navigation software during the procedures. Overall navigation accuracy (11 measurements) was 10.0 ± 3.8 mm, maximum 17.6 mm, minimum 4.5 mm. An adequate sample was obtained in 6/6 (100%) of targeted lymph nodes. No adverse events were registered. Conclusions Electromagnetic navigated EBUS-TBNA was feasible, safe and easy in this human pilot study. The clinical usefulness was clearly demonstrated. Fusion of real-time ultrasound, preoperative CT and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy provided a controlled guiding to level of target, intraoperative overview and procedure documentation."
https://openalex.org/W2587660030,"Vascular hyperpermeability is critical in ischemic diseases, including stroke and myocardial infarction, as well as in inflammation and cancer. It is well known that the VEGF–VEGFR2 signaling pathways are pivotal in promoting vascular permeability; however, counterbalancing mechanisms that restrict vascular permeability to maintain the integrity of blood vessels are not yet fully understood. We report that TNF superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15), a cytokine largely produced by vascular endothelial cells and a specific inhibitor of the proliferation of these same cells, can inhibit VEGF-induced vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo, and that death receptor 3 (DR3), a cell surface receptor of TNFSF15, mediates TNFSF15-induced dephosphorylation of VEGFR2. Src homology region 2 domain–containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) becomes associated with DR3 upon TNFSF15 interaction with the latter. In addition, a protein complex consisting of VEGFR2, DR3, and SHP-1 is formed in response to the effects of TNFSF15 and VEGF on endothelial cells. It is plausible that this protein complex provides a structural basis for the molecular mechanism in which TNFSF15 induces the inhibition of VEGF-stimulated vascular hyperpermeability.—Yang, G.-L., Zhao, Z., Qin, T.-T., Wang, D., Chen, L., Xiang, R., Xi, Z., Jiang, R., Zhang, Z.-S., Zhang, J., Li.

https://openalex.org/W2587005934,"Nowadays, small pulmonary nodules are easily detectable in patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) because of highly improved computed tomography (CT) technologies. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and significance of the pulmonary nodules detected by CT in high-grade STS patients. 124 patients with high-grade STS were retrospectively reviewed. There were 72 males (57%) and 52 females (43%). Patients' average age was 61 years (median (quartiles) 66 years (48-75), range 8-94 years). Pulmonary nodules were detected in 49 (39.5%) of 124 patients by CT scanning at first presentation. Of 49 patients with nodules at first presentation, 34 (69.4%) had benign lesions, and 13 (26.5%) had metastatic nodules. One patient (2%) had primary lung cancer and the remaining one with one nodule could not be definitively diagnosed due to a short follow-up time. 30 patients (24.1%) of 124 patients developed pulmonary nodules during their clinical progression. Seven (23.3%) had benign lesions, whereas 21 (70%) had metastatic lesions. Primary lung cancer was detected in two patients (6.7%). The size and timing of detection of a pulmonary nodule significantly affected the final clinical diagnosisby multivariate analysis. We conclude that pulmonary nodules can be detected highly frequently in patients with high-grade STSs because of improved CT technologies. Careful follow-up is needed if nodules are detected after initial treatment or during the clinical course of the disease."

Isolates varied in virulence, with human and porcine isolates sharing MST22 genotype showing a thousand fold higher bacterial replication in lungs and more dissemination to spleen and liver than the human and porcine MST91 isolates. Virulent MST22 type was also associated with progressive suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 responses, and increased IL-10 production. Whole genome sequencing of the two virulent isolates with MST22 genotype and two avirulent isolates of genotype MST91 and comparison with two well-studied M. avium subsp. hominissuis reference strains i.e. Mah 104 and Mah TH135, identified in the two MST22 isolates nine specific virulence factors of the mammalian cell entry family, that were identical with Mah 104 strain. Despite the obvious limitations of the mouse model, a striking link of virulence and identity at the genome level of porcine and human isolates with the same multisequence type, for which no correlation of place of residence (humans) or farm of origin (pigs) was observed, seems to point to the existence in the environment of certain genotypes of Mah which may be more infectious both for humans and pigs than other genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2586922271,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a species-specific β-herpesvirus that infects for life up to 80% of the world's population and causes severe morbidity in at-risk immunocompromised populations. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 and SOCS3 are host proteins that act as inducible negative feedback regulators of cytokine signaling and have been implicated in several ocular diseases and viral infections. We recently found in our mouse model of experimental cytomegalovirus retinitis that subretinally-injected murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) stimulates ocular SOCS1 and SOCS3 during retrovirus-induced immune suppression of murine AIDS (MAIDS), and that infiltrating macrophages are prominent cellular sources of retinal SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression. Herein we investigate possible virologic mechanisms whereby MCMV infection may stimulate SOCS1 and/or SOCS3 expression in cell culture. We report that infection of IC-21 mouse macrophages with MCMV propagated through the salivary glands of BALB/c mice, but not from tissue culture in C57BL/6 fibroblasts, transiently stimulates SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA transcripts, but not SOCS5 mRNA. Viral tegument proteins are insufficient for this stimulation, as replication-deficient UV-inactivated MCMV fails to stimulate SOCS1 or SOCS3 in IC-21 macrophages. By contrast, infection of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with either productive MCMV or UV-inactivated MCMV significantly stimulates SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expression early after infection. Treatment of MCMV-infected IC-21 mouse macrophages with the antiviral drug ganciclovir significantly decreases MCMV-stimulated SOCS3 expression at 3 days post-infection. These data suggest cell type-specific, different roles for viral immediate early or early gene expression and/or viral tegument proteins in the early stimulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 during MCMV infection. Furthermore, putative biphasic stimulation of SOCS3 during late MCMV infection of IC-21 mouse macrophages may occur by divergent virologic mechanisms."

Improving the topography of Ti surface may enhance osseointegration, however, the mechanism remains unknown. To investigate the effect of modified Ti surface on osteogenesis, we loaded rapamycin (RA) onto nano-hydroxyapatite (HAp) coated Ti surface which was acid-etched, alkali-heated and HAp coated sequentially. Sodium hyaluronate (SH) was employed as an intermediate layer for the load of RA, and a steady release rate of RA was maintained. Cell vitality of MC3T3-E1 was assessed by MTT. Osteogenesis of MC3T3-E1 on this modified Ti surface was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization and related osteogenesis genes osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN), Collagen-I and Runx2. The result revealed that RA/SH-loaded nano-HAp Ti surface was innocent for cell vitality and even more beneficial for cell osteogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, osteogenesis of MC3T3-E1 showed significant association with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation by RA, which required further study about the mechanism. The approach to this modified Ti surface presented in this paper has high research value for the development of Ti-based implant."
https://openalex.org/W2586925314,"This transdisciplinary study has a three-fold systems approach in evaluating a horticultural technology: 1) horticultural evaluations, 2) economic and resource analyses, and 3) systems engineering analyses, using low temperature storage as an example technology. Vegetable grafting is a technique to produce value-added seedlings but requires labor intensive nursery operations. Low temperature storage of seedlings for a short period of time can reduce peak production, but has not been evaluated at the extent demonstrated in this paper. Seedlings of 22 genotypes of Cucurbitaceae (cucurbit family) and Solanaceae (nightshade family) were evaluated for storability under selected temperatures and photosynthetic photon flux. Storability of Cucurbitaceous seedlings varied between 2 to 4 weeks at 12°C and 13 μmol m-2 s-1. Solanaceous seedlings were generally storable for 4 weeks at 12°C and 13 μmol m-2 s-1, but tomato seedlings could be stored for 4 weeks at 10°C and 5 μmol m-2 s-1. Capital and weekly operational costs of a low temperature storage system with a design that meets environmental requirements were estimated as $671 to $708 per m2 footprint and $0.79 to $2.21 per m2 footprint per week, respectively. Electricity costs per plant was less than 0.1 cents for 2 to 4 weeks of storage. Using a schedule-optimization heuristic and a logistics simulator previously developed for grafting nursery operations, six production scenarios consisting of two crops (tomato or watermelon) and three production peak patterns were examined to evaluate the impact of including low temperature storage. While the overall average costs of grafting labor were not significantly different, maximum labor demand and grafting labor cost during the peak production week were reduced by 31% to 50% and 14% to 30% by using storage, respectively. Therefore, low temperature storage can be an effective means to address the issue of labor management in grafting nurseries."

Among the synthetic coumarins, O-allyl and O-isopentenyl derivatives demonstrated no considerable lipoxygenase inhibition while O-geranyl and O-farnesyl derivatives demonstrated potent inhibitory activity. 5-farnesyloxy-3-carboxycoumarin demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activity by IC50 = 0.74 μM while 6-farnesyloxy-3-carboxycoumarin was the weakest inhibitor among farnesyl analogs (IC50 = 10.4 μM). Bonding affinity of the designed molecular structures toward 15-LOX-1 3D structure complexed with RS75091, as potent 15-LOX-1 inhibitor, was studied by utilizing docking analysis. There was a direct relationship between lipoxygenase inhibitory potency and prenyl length chain. The ability of the prenyl portion to fill the lipophilic pocket which is formed by Ile663, Ala404, Arg403, Ile400, Ile173 and Phe167 side chains can explain the observed relationship. Similarity rate between the docked models and complexed form of RS75091, from point of view of configuration and conformation, could explain inhibitory potency variation between each prenyloxy substitution of 3-carboxycoumarins."
https://openalex.org/W2586550166,"Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and artesunate (ARS), two artemisinin derivatives, have efficacious anticancer activities against human hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cells. This study aims to study the anticancer action of the combination treatment of DHA/ARS and farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), a Ras inhibitor, in HCC cells (Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines). FTS pretreatment significantly enhanced DHA/ARS-induced phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, Bak/Bax activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-8 and -9 activations, characteristics of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. Pretreatment with Z-IETD-FMK (caspase-8 inhibitor) potently prevented the cytotoxicity of the combination treatment of DHA/ARS and FTS, and pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) significantly inhibited the loss of ΔΨm induced by DHA/ARS treatment or the combination treatment of DHA/ARS and FTS in HCC cells. Furthermore, silencing Bak/Bax modestly but significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity of the combination treatment of DHA/ARS and FTS. Interestingly, pretreatment with an antioxidant N-Acetyle-Cysteine (NAC) significantly prevented the cytotoxicity of the combination treatment of DHA and FTS instead of the combination treatment of ARS and FTS, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) played a key role in the anticancer action of the combination treatment of DHA and FTS. Similar to FTS, DHA/ARS also significantly prevented Ras activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that FTS potently sensitizes Huh-7 and HepG2 cells to artemisinin derivatives via accelerating the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways."

Though widely practiced, the effects de-escalation are not well understood. Definitions of interventions and outcomes differ among studies. We use mathematical models of the transmission and evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an intensive care unit to assess the effect of de-escalation on a broad range of outcomes, and clarify expectations. In these models, de-escalation reduces the use of high-value drugs and preserves the effectiveness of empiric therapy, while also selecting for multidrug-resistant strains and leaving patients vulnerable to colonization and superinfection. The net effect of de-escalation in our models is to increase infection prevalence while also increasing the probability of effective treatment. Changes in mortality are small, and can be either positive or negative. The clinical significance of small changes in outcomes such as infection prevalence and death may exceed more easily detectable changes in drug use and resistance. Integrating harms and benefits into ranked outcomes for each patient may provide a way forward in the analysis of these tradeoffs. Our models provide a conceptual framework for the collection and interpretation of evidence needed to inform antimicrobial stewardship."
https://openalex.org/W2587716319,"The glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GCK) and the pro-apoptotic protein BAD reportedly reside within a five-membered complex that localizes to the mitochondria of mammalian hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells. Photochemical crosslinking studies using a synthetic analog of BAD’s BH3 domain and in vitro transcription/translation experiments support a direct interaction between BAD and GCK. To investigate the biochemical and biophysical consequences of the BAD:GCK interaction, we developed a method for the production of recombinant human BAD. Consistent with published reports, recombinant BAD displays high affinity for Bcl-xL (KD = 7 nM), and phosphorylation of BAD at S118, within the BH3 domain, abolishes this interaction. Unexpectedly, we do not detect association of recombinant, full-length BAD with recombinant human pancreatic GCK over a range of protein concentrations using various biochemical methods including size-exclusion chromatography, chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, fluorescence polarization assays and isothermal titration calorimetry detect no direct interaction between GCK and BAD BH3 peptides. Kinetic characterization of GCK in the presence of high concentrations of recombinant BAD show modest (<15%) increases in GCK activity, observable only at glucose concentrations well below the K0.5 value. GCK activity is unaffected by BAD BH3 peptides. These results raise questions as to the mechanism of action of stapled peptide analogs modeled after the BAD BH3 domain, which reportedly enhance the Vmax value of GCK and stimulate insulin release in BAD-deficient islets. Based on our results, we postulate that the BAD:GCK interaction, and any resultant regulatory effect(s) upon GCK activity, requires the participation of additional members of the mitochondrial complex."

This study used real-time visual feedback to modify biomechanical factors linked to an elevated metabolic demand of walking in individuals with transtibial amputation. Eight persons with unilateral, traumatic transtibial amputation and 8 uninjured controls participated. Two separate bouts of real-time visual feedback were provided during a single session of gait retraining to reduce 1) center of mass sway and 2) thigh muscle activation magnitudes and duration. Baseline and post-intervention data were collected. Metabolic rate, heart rate, frontal plane center of mass sway, quadriceps and hamstrings muscle activity, and co-contraction indices were evaluated during steady state walking at a standardized speed. Visual feedback successfully decreased center of mass sway 12% (p = 0.006) and quadriceps activity 12% (p = 0.041); however, thigh muscle co-contraction indices were unchanged. Neither condition significantly affected metabolic rate during walking and heart rate increased with center-of-mass feedback. Metabolic rate, center of mass sway, and integrated quadriceps muscle activity were all not significantly different from controls. Attempts to modify gait to decrease metabolic demand may actually adversely increase the physiological effort of walking in individuals with lower extremity amputation who are young, active and approximate metabolic rates of able-bodied adults."

The severity of skeletal dysplasias ranges from precocious arthropathy to perinatal lethality. Although the pathomechanisms of these disorders are generally well defined, the feasibility of repairing established aberrant skeletal tissues that developed in the presence of mutant molecules is currently unknown. Here, we employed a validated mouse model of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) that enables temporal control of the production of the R992C (p.R1192C) collagen II mutant that causes this disease. Although in our earlier studies we determined that blocking the expression of this mutant at the early prenatal stages prevents a SED phenotype, the utility of blocking the R992C collagen II at the postnatal stages is not known. Here, by switching off the expression of R992C collagen II at various postnatal stages of skeletal development, we determined that significant improvements of cartilage and bone morphology were achieved only when blocking the production of the mutant molecules was initiated in newborn mice. Our study indicates that future therapies of skeletal dysplasias may require defining a specific time window when interventions should be applied to be successful."
https://openalex.org/W2587099365,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is characterised by the loss of specific populations of neurons in the brain. The mechanisms underlying this selective cell death are unknown but by using laser capture microdissection, the glycoprotein, CD24 has been identified as a potential marker of the populations of cells that are affected in PD. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on sections of mouse brain, we confirmed that CD24 is robustly expressed by many of these subsets of cells. To determine if CD24 may have a functional role in PD, we modelled the dopamine cell loss of PD in Cd24 mutant mice using striatal delivery of the neurotoxin 6-OHDA. We found that Cd24 mutant mice have an anatomically normal dopamine system and that this glycoprotein does not modulate the lesion effects of 6-OHDA delivered into the striatum. We then undertook in situ hybridization studies on sections of human brain and found-as in the mouse brain-that CD24 is expressed by many of the subsets of the cells that are vulnerable in PD, but not those of the midbrain dopamine system. Finally, we sought to determine if CD24 is required for the neuroprotective effect of Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Our results indicate that in the absence of CD24, there is a reduction in the protective effects of GDNF on the dopaminergic fibres in the striatum, but no difference in the survival of the cell bodies in the midbrain. While we found no obvious role for CD24 in the normal development and maintenance of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system in mice, it may have a role in mediating the neuroprotective aspects of GDNF in this system."

https://openalex.org/W2594311533,"Could dark matter consist of primordial black holes, as numerous as the stars? It9s an old, improbable idea, but it made a Lazarus-like comeback a year ago, when the discovery of gravitational waves suggested that the cosmos abounds with unexpectedly heavy black holes. Last February physicists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) announced that they had detected ripples in space from the violent merger of two black holes 29 and 36 times as massive as our sun—more than twice as massive as physicists thought so-called stellar mass black holes could be. If scads of those black holes are out there, then they might account for the 85% of the universe9s matter that is missing, one team of physicists argues. However, the idea is now coming under pressure from other directions, including studies of the cosmic microwave background and of tiny dwarf galaxies on the periphery of the Milky Way.

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a key role in the decision process, encoding both momentary reward and the context of the accumulated wealth. A new study by Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar demonstrates that individuals take fewer risks as they accumulate monetary reward. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a key role in the decision process, encoding both momentary reward and the context of the accumulated wealth. Risk taking is a basic trade-off between the mean and variance of the outcomes of one’s behavior. While risk attitudes are well studied across psychology, neuroscience, and economics, little is known about how individual risk preferences evolve. Specifically, the relationship between risk taking and wealth (both endowment and accumulated experimental earnings) remains an open question. Commonly employed economic models of risky choice assume that the propensity to avoid risk (absolute risk aversion) decreases as one accumulates wealth. The basic intuition here is that the more wealth you have, the better you are able to cushion potential losses. Prospect theory, the most prominent model for studying risk in psychology, provides less guidance on this point (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979Kahneman D. Tversky A. Econometrica. 1979; 47: 263-292Crossref Google Scholar). Prospect theory features a reference point, above which payoffs are considered gains and below which payoffs are considered losses. The reference point in the model lends it flexibility but also complicates behavioral predictions as it allows decisions to be evaluated either in isolation or in a wider context, such as total earnings. Assuming the latter case, behavior typically shifts from risk-seeking below the reference point (in the loss domain) to risk-averse above the reference point (in the gain domain). Within either domain though, risk aversion decreases with more wealth. In other words, we might expect to see both increasing and decreasing risk aversion as earnings accumulate, depending on where one stands relative to the reference point. Empirical evidence, both field and experimental, has been inconclusive about wealth effects. Risk aversion has been shown to decrease with a larger endowment (Fafchamps et al., 2015Fafchamps M. Kebede B. Zizzo D.J. Eur. Econ. Rev. 2015; 79: 59-79Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with more accumulated earnings (Levy, 1994Levy H. J. Risk Uncertain. 1994; 8: 289-307Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and after single-trial gains (Thaler and Johnson, 1990Thaler R.H. Johnson E.J. Manage. Sci. 1990; 36: 643-660Crossref Google Scholar) (a phenomenon known as the “house money effect”). On the other hand, risk aversion has also occasionally been shown to increase with accumulated earnings, though here the results varied across cultures (Fafchamps et al., 2015Fafchamps M. Kebede B. Zizzo D.J. Eur. Econ. Rev. 2015; 79: 59-79Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The take-away message is that there is a fairly clear belief in decreasing absolute risk aversion but a paucity of clear empirical findings. More importantly, this question has been largely ignored in neuroscience, with only rare exceptions (Hytönen et al., 2014Hytönen K. Baltussen G. van den Assem M.J. Klucharev V. Sanfey A.G. Smidts A. J. Econ. Behav. Organ. 2014; 107: 566-581Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C.

A serious complication with studying the effects of earnings on risk behavior is disentangling those effects from the effects of passing time. Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar employ a standard choice task, where subjects decide whether to accept or reject different gambles, but cleverly use a series of “contexts,” with each context having its own “money pot” that accumulates earnings from that context. Participants knew how many trials contributed to each context, but were not able to see, in any explicit way, how much money they accumulated in the pot. At the end of each scanner run, subjects received the actual earnings from one randomly selected context. In this way, Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar were able to repeatedly study the effects of accumulating earnings within subject and separate the effects of time from effects of wealth. In terms of anatomical localization, there is emerging consensus that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encodes the value of reward, including, but not limited to, monetary gains. Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar confirm this by identifying a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlated with the momentary reward in each trial of the experiment. More interestingly, their study is the first to demonstrate that a more anterior region of the vmPFC tracks the unseen accumulated wealth (Figure 1). So the neural data demonstrate that subjects are in fact monitoring their accumulated earnings in each context. The more anterior location of this activity is consistent with a recently identified posterior-to-anterior vmPFC gradient of value representation for concrete-to-abstract reward (Clithero and Rangel, 2014Clithero J.A. Rangel A. Soc. Cogn. Affect. Neurosci. 2014; 9: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). That is, the current trial’s earnings are concrete, while the overall accumulated earnings may be more abstract. These findings contrast with those of Hytönen et al., 2014Hytönen K. Baltussen G. van den Assem M.J. Klucharev V. Sanfey A.G. Smidts A. J. Econ. Behav. Organ. 2014; 107: 566-581Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, who studied pairs of sequential gambles and also found that vmPFC encoded current trial gains more than losses, but did not report any increased activity following gain trials. Admittedly, these two studies are difficult to compare since it is impossible to definitively attribute the Hytönen et al., 2014Hytönen K. Baltussen G. van den Assem M.J. Klucharev V. Sanfey A.G. Smidts A. J. Econ. Behav. Organ. 2014; 107: 566-581Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar effects to cumulative earnings versus simple spillover from the previous trial’s outcome. In line with the neural findings, subjects’ behavior also seemed to track the amount of money they accumulated: as they earned more within a context, they tended to make safer choices. Again, this is quite surprising, given the prevailing assumption that more earnings should lead to less risk aversion. To explain these findings, Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar compare their model, previously applied only to perceptual decisions, to standard risk-aversion and prospect theory models, as well as several enhanced versions of those models. The best-fitting model was Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar’s adaptive gain model, where accumulated earnings cause shifts in the sigmoidal gain curve that transforms utility into choices. These upward shifts lead to a bias that favors more cautious choices. This research highlights how insights from perception may provide new, potentially better, models for value-based decision making. Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar find that their adaptive gain model produces behavior that is consistent with the idea that subjects do not just maximize their expected reward, but rather minimize the chance of falling below some threshold wealth (for instance, zero). While this behavior is qualitatively consistent with prospect theory, the adaptive gain model provides a better quantitative fit, at least in this setting. The analogy between perceptual and economic (value-based) decision making is worth further consideration. An emerging literature in neuroeconomics and decision neuroscience has sought to link perceptual and economic decision making using models from neuroscience, including sequential sampling models (Polanía et al., 2014Polanía R. Krajbich I. Grueschow M. Ruff C.C. Neuron. 2014; 82: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and normalization (Woodford, 2014Woodford M. Am. Econ. Rev. 2014; 104: 495-500Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). While the joint consideration of these problems has yielded many fruits, it is also important to consider differences between these settings. For instance, while visual adaptation to past stimuli is a straightforward concept, it is less obvious what it means to adapt to accumulated earnings. Since the total earnings are not directly experienced, the mechanism relies on adaptation to each trial’s earnings. In that case, should we interpret the observed activity in vmPFC as an explicit representation of accumulated earnings, or instead as an implicit representation of the sum of past adjustments, captured by the model’s bias parameter b? Along these lines, it is important to note that in Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar’s model, the adaptation occurs in utility space rather than dollar space. That is, the decision maker does not adapt to the dollar amounts received and distort the perception of future dollar amounts (as in Woodford, 2014Woodford M. Am. Econ. Rev. 2014; 104: 495-500Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Instead, the dollar outcomes are always perceived in the same way, in the sense that they undergo the same transformation from dollar amount to utility. The distortion occurs after this transformation in the conversion from utility to choice. It is interesting to note that while subjects in the study appeared to track accumulated earnings within a context, they did not appear to track earnings across contexts. To some extent, this is by design, since only one context per run was selected for payment. On the other hand, if subjects consider their earnings in the context of the whole run or experiment, one might in fact expect higher earnings in other contexts to have similar effects as earnings within the context. Why this did not seem to occur is an interesting question for future research: what factors cause individuals to separate one context from another, and can this be detected with fMRI? As one potential clue, Juechems et al., 2017Juechems K. Balaguer J. Ruz M. Summerfield C. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar find that more dorsal regions of prefrontal cortex appear to track a subject’s position within a context. The behavioral economics literature on mental accounting may also provide some guidance here (Thaler and Johnson, 1990Thaler R.H. Johnson E.J. Manage. Sci. 1990; 36: 643-660Crossref Google Scholar). On a similar note, it is interesting to ask what factors influence the effect of accumulated earnings on risk behavior. Does it matter whether the earnings occur all at once or in smaller chunks? Is it necessary that the earnings arise from subjects’ past decisions, or can they be due to initial endowments or income shocks beyond the subjects’ control? In one of the experiments run by Fafchamps et al., 2015Fafchamps M. Kebede B. Zizzo D.J. Eur. Econ. Rev. 2015; 79: 59-79Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, they find opposite effects of initial endowments and accumulated earnings on risk taking. Thus, these two sources of earnings may be treated as separate mental accounts. As another example, a study with macaques showed that they become more risk seeking under more prosperous conditions, specifically shorter time intervals between trials (Hayden and Platt, 2007Hayden B.Y. Platt M.L. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 49-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Do these seemingly conflicting results have to do with the size or modality of the reward, the temporal nature of the macaque experiment, or simply with the different species? Answers to these questions should help to shed more light on the neural mechanisms underlying risk taking. Finally, beyond the obvious importance of understanding how individuals’ risk attitudes change as a function of their wealth, this issue is also of methodological importance. Many argue that in order to properly measure risk preferences, it is important to incentivize only one randomly selected decision out of the many that subjects make in an experiment. With a sum of their earnings being paid, individuals may hedge their bets across trials, creating a “portfolio effect” (Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009Sokol-Hessner P. Hsu M. Curley N.G. Delgado M.R. Camerer C.F. Phelps E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 5035-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Others have argued that individuals tend not to consider their decisions in the broader context of their overall earnings, a phenomenon known as “narrow bracketing,” a type of mental accounting (Thaler and Johnson, 1990Thaler R.H. Johnson E.J. Manage. Sci. 1990; 36: 643-660Crossref Google Scholar). This debate has implications for experimental design and interpretation and could partially account for differences in risk attitudes observed across studies. The current study suggests that the answer may lie somewhere in the middle; subjects seem to account for accumulated earnings within a context, but they do not seem to account for earnings in the other contexts or runs of the experiment. Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Encodes a Latent Estimate of Cumulative RewardJuechems et al.NeuronFebruary 08, 2017In BriefTo avoid harmful losses, humans should change their risk attitudes as a function of accumulated value (wealth). Juechems et al. show that humans become more risk averse with increasing cumulative value and that vmPFC encodes the current level of wealth. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
