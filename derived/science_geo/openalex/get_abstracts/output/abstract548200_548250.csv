https://openalex.org/W2194585050,"Adequate membrane fluidity is required for a variety of key cellular processes and in particular for proper function of membrane proteins. In most eukaryotic cells, membrane fluidity is known to be regulated by fatty acid desaturation and cholesterol, although some cells, such as insect cells, are almost devoid of sterol synthesis. We show here that insect and mammalian cells present similar microviscosity at their respective physiological temperature. To investigate how both sterols and phospholipids control fluidity homeostasis, we quantified the lipidic composition of insect SF9 and mammalian HEK 293T cells under normal or sterol-modified condition. As expected, insect cells show minimal sterols compared with mammalian cells. A major difference is also observed in phospholipid content as the ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) is inverted (4 times higher in SF9 cells). In vitro studies in liposomes confirm that both cholesterol and PE can increase rigidity of the bilayer, suggesting that both can be used by cells to maintain membrane fluidity. We then show that exogenously increasing the cholesterol amount in SF9 membranes leads to a significant decrease in PE:PC ratio whereas decreasing cholesterol in HEK 293T cells using statin treatment leads to an increase in the PE:PC ratio. In all cases, the membrane fluidity is maintained, indicating that both cell types combine regulation by sterols and phospholipids to control proper membrane fluidity."

However, due to poor cell survival, proliferation and differentiation in the patient, the therapy outcomes have not been satisfactory. Although several studies have been done to understand the conditions that promote proliferation, differentiation and migration of MSC in vitro and in vivo, still there is no clear understanding on the effect of non-cellular bio molecules. Of the many factors that influence the cell behavior, the immediate cell microenvironment plays a major role. In this context, we studied the effect of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in controlling cell survival, proliferation, migration and directed MSC differentiation. We found that collagen promoted cell proliferation, cell survival under stress and promoted high cell adhesion to the cell culture surface. Increased osteogenic differentiation accompanied by high active RHOA (Ras homology gene family member A) levels was exhibited by MSC cultured on collagen. In conclusion, our study shows that collagen will be a suitable matrix for large scale production of MSC with high survival rate and to obtain high osteogenic differentiation for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2193968315,"Amyloid β (Aβ) damages neurons and triggers microglial inflammatory activation in the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. BACE1 is the primary enzyme in Aβ generation. Neuroinflammation potentially up-regulates BACE1 expression and increases Aβ production. In Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein-transgenic mice and SH-SY5Y cell models, we specifically knocked out or knocked down gene expression of mapk14, which encodes p38α MAPK, a kinase sensitive to inflammatory and oxidative stimuli. Using immunological and biochemical methods, we observed that reduction of p38α MAPK expression facilitated the lysosomal degradation of BACE1, decreased BACE1 protein and activity, and subsequently attenuated Aβ generation in the AD mouse brain. Inhibition of p38α MAPK also enhanced autophagy. Blocking autophagy by treating cells with 3-methyladenine or overexpressing dominant-negative ATG5 abolished the deficiency of the p38α MAPK-induced BACE1 protein reduction in cultured cells. Thus, our study demonstrates that p38α MAPK plays a critical role in the regulation of BACE1 degradation and Aβ generation in AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2212216121,"The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway activated by proinflammatory cytokines, including the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). SOCS3 is also implicated in hypertriglyceridemia associated to insulin resistance. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels are frequently found to be positively correlated to insulin resistance and plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides concentrations. The present study aimed to investigate the possible role of TNF-α and JAK/STAT pathway on de novo lipogenesis and PCSK9 expression in HepG2 cells. TNF-α induced both SOCS3 and PCSK9 in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was inhibited by transfection with siRNA anti-STAT3, suggesting the involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway. Retroviral overexpression of SOCS3 in HepG2 cells (HepG2SOCS3) strongly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and induced PCSK9 mRNA and protein, with no effect on its promoter activity and mRNA stability. Consistently, siRNA anti-SOCS3 reduced PCSK9 mRNA levels, whereas an opposite effect was observed with siRNA anti-STAT3. In addition, HepG2SOCS3 express higher mRNA levels of key enzymes involved in the de novo lipogenesis, such as fattyacid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1, and apoB. These responses were associated with a significant increase of SCD-1 protein, activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1), accumulation of cellular triglycerides, and secretion of apoB. HepG2SOCS3 show lower phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) Tyr896 and Akt Ser473 in response to insulin. Finally, insulin stimulation produced an additive effect with SOCS3 overexpression, further inducing PCSK9, SREBP-1, fatty acid synthase, and apoB mRNA. In conclusion, our data candidate PCSK9 as a gene involved in lipid metabolism regulated by proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in a SOCS3-dependent manner.

Expression of CIS, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3 is induced by various cytokines, including IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (1Galic S. Sachithanandan N. Kay T.W. Steinberg G.R.

In obesity, the expression of SOCS proteins is elevated in a variety of tissues that are vital for regulating fatty acid (FA) metabolism and insulin sensitivity. For instance, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are up-regulated in the liver of obese diabetic db/db mice and other insulin resistance (IR) models such as ob/ob mice and mice fed high fat diet (6Ueki K. Kondo T. Kahn C.R.

The latter reduced in db/db mice the elevated hepatic lipid content and plasma triglycerides close to the normal observed in control mice (7Ueki K. Kondo T. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, liver of morbidly obese subjects exhibits higher expression of SOCS3 protein and attenuated JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in enhanced sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) transcriptional activity, a key regulator of de novo lipid biosynthesis (8Elam M.B.

Similarly to the genes involved in the regulation of the cholesterol homeostasis, i.e. hydroxyl-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and synthase and the LDLR, PCSK9 is under the control of the SREBP-2 (14Maxwell K.N.

For this reason the pharmacological activation of the SREBP pathway by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, induces PCSK9 both in experimental and clinical settings (15Guo Y.L. Liu J. Xu R.X.

Although SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c preferentially activate genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides, their homologous SREBP-2 preferentially transcribes for genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (18Goldstein J.L.

To this regard, PCSK9 appears to be regulated by both SREBP-2 and SREBP-1c (14Maxwell K.N. Soccio R.E. Duncan E.M. Sehayek E. Breslow J.L.

The involvement of SREBP-1c in the regulation of PCSK9 levels has also been observed in humans, where PCSK9 levels positively correlated with IR, liver steatosis, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL-TG) triglycerides (TG) (24Cariou B.

This evidence suggests that, although PCSK9 is an important regulator of LDL-C levels, it could also be implicated in the homeostasis of TG-rich lipoproteins. It is, indeed, of interest that the association between plasma PCSK9 and LDL-C is weak and has been estimated to account for only the 7% of the variations in LDL-C (25Lakoski S.G. Lagace T.A.

Based on these premises, the present study aimed to investigate the possible role of TNF-α and JAK/STAT pathway on de novo lipogenesis and PCSK9 expression in the human HepG2 cell line. The Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line, HepG2, was cultured in 10% FCS/MEM supplemented with penicillin (10,000 units/ml), streptomycin (10 mg/ml), nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. For the experiments, cells were incubated with MEM containing either 10% of lipoprotein plasma-deprived serum (LPDS) or 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as indicated in the figures legend. MEM, trypsin EDTA, penicillin, streptomycin, nonessential amino acid solution, FCS, disposable culture flasks, and Petri dishes were from Euroclone (Pero, Milan, Italy), and filters were from Millipore (Billerica, MA).

Four-week-old male ob/ob mice and their lean, wild-type male C57BL/6J controls were purchased from Charles River (Calco, Italy). In compliance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (National Institutes of Health publication 86-23), mice were housed at constant room temperature (23 °C) in a 12-h light/dark cycle (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) receiving standard chow and water ad libitum. Mice were sacrificed at 14 weeks of age in the fasted state. Full-length human SOCS3 (accession no. 003955) was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: 5′-CGGGATCCATGGTCACCCACAGCAAGTTTCC-3′ and 5′-CGCTCGAGTTAAAGCGGG GCATCGTACTGG-3′ and the Expand High-Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics). The sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-generated construct was confirmed by sequencing (Primm, Milan, Italy). Retroviral expression plasmid was then constructed using the pBM-IRES-PURO (28Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W.

Cells were then transfected with 20 nm siRNA for 48 h, then the medium was replaced with MEM containing 5% LPDS ± TNF-α for an additional 24 h before performing the quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) or WB analysis. Cholesterol biosynthesis was estimated by measuring the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cellular cholesterol, as previously described (32Corsini A. Verri D. Raiteri M. Quarato P. Paoletti R.

Total cellular lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol 3:2, and TG and cholesterol contents were determined with enzymatic assays (HORIBA ABX, Montpellier, France). Conditioned media was cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min) and store at −20 °C. The amount of apolipoprotein B (apoB) (Vinci-Biochem, Firenze, Italy) and PCSK9 (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN) was then quantified by using the ELISA assays according to manufacturer's instructions. The values were normalized with total cell protein contents, extracted from the cell monolayer, and determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

On the next day cells were transiently transfected with pGL3-PCSK9-D4 plasmids with turbofect reagent (Carlo Erba Reagents), and 48 h post transfection cells were incubated with serum-free medium in the presence or absence of insulin (10−7 m) for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activities were measured by using Neolite reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. pCMV-β vector, encoding for β-galactosidase (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was cotransfected as the internal control. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described (34Norata G.D.

Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by using the iBlotTM Gel Transfer Device (InvitrogenTM; Life Technologies). The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBS-T), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked in TBS-T containing 5% (BSA; Sigma) for 90 min at room temperature. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a diluted solution (5% BSA or nonfat dried milk) of the following human primary antibodies: anti-PCSK9 (1:100), anti SREBP-2 (1:200), anti-pAKT (1:100), anti-AKT (1:1,000), anti-pSTAT3 (1:10,000), anti-pIRS-1 (1:5,000), anti-SCD-1 (1:500), anti-STAT3 (1:1,000), anti-SREBP-1a (1:500), anti-SOCS3 (1:100), anti-HMG-CoA reductase (1:500), anti HNF-1α (1:1,000), and anti-α-tubulin (1:2,000). Membranes were washed with TBS-T and then exposed for 90 min at room temperature to a diluted solution (5% nonfat dried milk) of the secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected by exposing the membranes to ClarityTM Western ECL chemiluminescent substrates (Bio-Rad) for 5 min, and images were acquired with a ChemiDocTM XRS system (Bio-Rad). Densitometric readings were evaluated using the ImageLabTM software as previously described. The values of the phosphorylated proteins were normalized to those of the corresponding constitutive forms to express arbitrary units of relative expression. Statistical analysis was performed using the Prism statistical analysis package Version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are given as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.

New effective therapies are clearly needed. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell surface-associated serine protease up-regulated in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as well as in wound healing and cancer. We postulate that FAP is not only a marker of disease but influences the development of pulmonary fibrosis after lung injury. In two different models of pulmonary fibrosis, intratracheal bleomycin instillation and thoracic irradiation, we find increased mortality and increased lung fibrosis in FAP-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Lung extracellular matrix analysis reveals accumulation of intermediate-sized collagen fragments in FAP-deficient mouse lungs, consistent with in vitro studies showing that FAP mediates ordered proteolytic processing of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-derived collagen cleavage products. FAP-mediated collagen processing leads to increased collagen internalization without altering expression of the endocytic collagen receptor, Endo180. Pharmacologic FAP inhibition decreases collagen internalization as expected. Conversely, restoration of FAP expression in the lungs of FAP-deficient mice decreases lung hydroxyproline content after intratracheal bleomycin to levels comparable with that of wild-type controls. Our findings indicate that FAP participates directly, in concert with MMPs, in collagen catabolism and clearance and is an important factor in resolving scar after injury and restoring lung homeostasis. Our study identifies FAP as a novel endogenous regulator of fibrosis and is the first to show FAP's protective effects in the lung.

In regard to fibrosis, however, FAP remains a relatively understudied protein, and its place in the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown. The studies described herein were designed to define the role of FAP in the development of pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, employing a genetic approach with global knock-in mice in which the Fap gene has been replaced by a lacZ gene that is expressed under the control of the endogenous Fap promoter (28Niedermeyer J. Kriz M. Hilberg F. Garin-Chesa P. Bamberger U. Lenter M.C. Park J. Viertel B. Püschner H. Mauz M. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Targeted disruption of mouse fibroblast activation protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two well established complementary murine models of pulmonary fibrosis, intratracheal bleomycin and thoracic irradiation (29Moore B.B. Hogaboam C.M. Murine models of pulmonary fibrosis.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2008; 294: L152-L160Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), were used. FAP-deficient mice demonstrated increased mortality and increased lung collagen content compared with wild-type mice in both models. This phenotype was not attributable to increased myofibroblast induction, heightened collagen synthesis, or appreciable differences in MMP activity. Instead, we present evidence that loss of FAP expression directly results in defective processing of type 1 collagen and impaired ECM remodeling. In addition, although we did not find increased numbers of α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells by immunofluorescence staining, FAP-deficient primary mouse lung fibroblasts displayed more robust induction of a myofibroblast phenotype compared with wild-type in response to TGF-β. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that FAP protects against the development of pulmonary fibrosis after lung injury. Eight- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. FAP-deficient FAPLacZ/LacZ mice (28Niedermeyer J. Kriz M. Hilberg F. Garin-Chesa P. Bamberger U.

Schnapp (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Ingelheim, Germany) and backcrossed 12 generations to a C57BL/6 background to facilitate fibrosis studies. These FAP-null mice have been previously characterized and show no developmental nor overt adult abnormalities under homeostatic conditions (28Niedermeyer J. Kriz M. Hilberg F. Garin-Chesa P. Bamberger U. Lenter M.C. Park J. Viertel B. Püschner H. Mauz M. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Targeted disruption of mouse fibroblast activation protein.Mol. Cell.

Targeting fibroblast activation protein inhibits tumor stromagenesis and growth in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free animal facility at the Wistar Institute or at the University of Pittsburgh. The protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Wistar Institute or the University of Pittsburgh, and all procedures were conducted according to ethical committee guidelines on animal welfare and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (30National Research Council (United States) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory AnimalsGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.8th Ed. National Academies Press, Washington, D.C2011: 1-220Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized and irradiated as described previously (31Machtay M. Scherpereel A. Santiago J. Lee J. McDonough J.

In brief, 8–12-week-old female FAPLacZ/LacZ mice and age/sex-matched controls were anesthetized with intraperitoneal xylazine/ketamine. A single fraction of 13.5 Gy was delivered to the thorax of the mice via a 250-kVp orthovoltage machine. A customized jig provided lead shielding over the animals' head/neck and abdomen/pelvis regions, exposing only the thorax to irradiation. Mice were followed for modified survival studies, and survivors were sacrificed 16 weeks after thoracic irradiation for tissue collection. 8–12-Week-old male FAPLacZ/LacZ mice and age/sex-matched controls were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine. A single dose of bleomycin (1.0–1.75 IU/kg, depending on experiment) was administered by i.t. injection, using a STEPPERTM repetitive pipette (TridakTM, LLC) to minimize dose variations due to pipetting error. Mice were either followed for modified survival studies or sacrificed at designated time points for tissue collection. Male mice were used as they are more bleomycin-sensitive than their female counterparts. Collagen quantification was performed by hydroxyproline assay as previously described (24Santos A.M. Jung J. Aziz N. Kissil J.L. Puré E. Targeting fibroblast activation protein inhibits tumor stromagenesis and growth in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The right lung was consistently dedicated for this assay to allow comparison. Hydroxyproline content may be converted to collagen content using the conversion factor of 1 μg of hydroxyproline corresponds to 6.94 μg of collagen. Antigen retrieval was performed on de-paraffinized lung sections using 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 20 min at 95 °C. Slides were washed at room temperature and hydrated in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was then quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and endogenous avidin and biotin blocked using a commercially available avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in biotin-conjugated sheep anti-human FAP antibody (R&D Systems; AF3715; 15 μg/ml) or biotin-conjugated sheep control antibody (R&D Systems; BAF020;15 μg/ml). Sections were then washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and specific signal amplification was performed using an HRP-streptavidin/biotin-XX tyramide-containing tyramide signal amplification kit (Molecular Probes), followed by detection using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). n = 3 animals/group. Immunofluorescence staining for α-SMA was performed on deparaffinized lung sections as described previously (24Santos A.M. Jung J. Aziz N. Kissil J.L. Puré E. Targeting fibroblast activation protein inhibits tumor stromagenesis and growth in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Prepared slides were incubated with rabbit anti-αSMA (Abcam; ab5694; 1:100; 2 μg/ml) or isotype control antibody at 4 °C overnight. AlexaFluor-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.; A11036; 1:500) was used as the secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Life Technologies Inc.; 300 nm) and mounted for fluorescence microscopy. An ImageJ macro was constructed to objectively quantify the amount of α-SMA signal found in the total area of lung injury per field. The analysis was performed in a blinded fashion by an independent observer. For each mouse, all five lung lobes were examined, with four different ×40 images taken per lobe; n = 3–4 mice per group. The percentage of total injured lung area showing positive αSMA signal was quantified by computer assisted morphometry using ImageJ. Lung sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated as described previously (24Santos A.M. Jung J. Aziz N. Kissil J.L. Puré E. Targeting fibroblast activation protein inhibits tumor stromagenesis and growth in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3613-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Sections were then incubated in preheated Bouin's solution (Rowley Biochemicals) at 56 °C for 1 h. Sections were then cooled and washed in a running tap of H2O until all yellow color was removed. Nuclei were then stained with Weigert's iron hematoxylin (Rowley Biochemicals) for 15 min. Slides were washed in a running tap of H2O for 5 min and then rinsed with nanopure H2O. Slides were then stained in Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin (Rowley Biochemicals) for 15 min, rinsed with nanopure H2O, and then placed in phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acid (Rowley Biochemicals) solution for 10 min. This was followed by staining in aniline blue (Rowley Biochemicals) for 15 min. Slides were then rinsed in nanopure water, quickly dehydrated in 95 and 100% ETOH, cleared in xylene, and mounted with coverslips. Murine anti-murine FAP antibody 73.3 was produced and characterized in our laboratory as described (32Wang L.C. Lo A. Scholler J. Sun J. Majumdar R.S. Kapoor V. Antzis M. Cotner C.E. Johnson L.A.

HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat, goat anti-rabbit, donkey anti-sheep, and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Immunoblotting for detection of murine FAP was performed after immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed from equal amounts of protein (1 mg of lung homogenate/sample). Samples were precleared by incubating with 50 μg of isotype IgG1-conjugated agarose beads for 2 h and nutating at 4 °C. The samples were then spun down at 2000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with either 50 μg of anti-FAP 73.3-conjugated protein A-agarose beads or 50 μg of isotype IgG1-conjugated protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C.

Because such tasks are essential to foraging in a marine environment, increasing exposure to DA may be contributing to increasing sea lion strandings. Science , this issue p. 1545"
https://openalex.org/W2197775693,"Although previous studies suggested an anti-inflammatory property of Brazilian red propolis (BRP), the mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of BRP and its activity on macrophages were still not elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate whether BRP attenuates the inflammatory effect of LPS on macrophages and to investigate its underlying mechanisms. BRP was added to RAW 264.7 murine macrophages after activation with LPS. NO production, cell viability, cytokines profile were evaluated. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and macrophage polarization were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot. BRP at 50 μg/ml inhibited NO production by 78% without affecting cell viability. Cd80 and Cd86 were upregulated whereas mrc1 was down regulated by BRP indicating macrophage polarization at M1. BRP attenuated the production of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-12, GM-CSF, IFN-Ɣ, IL-1β in cell supernatants although levels of TNF- α and IL-6 were slightly increased after BRP treatment. Levels of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β were also reduced by BRP. BRP significantly reduced the up-regulation promoted by LPS of transcription of genes in inflammatory signaling (Pdk1, Pak1, Nfkb1, Mtcp1, Gsk3b, Fos and Elk1) and of Il1β and Il1f9 (fold-change rate > 5), which were further confirmed by the inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, the upstream adaptor MyD88 adaptor-like (Mal), also known as TIRAP, involved in TLR2 and TLR4 signaling, was down- regulated in BRP treated LPS-activated macrophages. Given that BRP inhibited multiple signaling pathways in macrophages involved in the inflammatory process activated by LPS, our data indicated that BRP is a noteworthy food-source for the discovery of new bioactive compounds and a potential candidate to attenuate exhacerbated inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2192174486,"The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains four genes that were originally annotated as potentially encoding DNA gyrase: ATGYRA, ATGYRB1, ATGYRB2, and ATGYRB3. Although we subsequently showed that ATGYRB3 does not encode a gyrase subunit, the other three genes potentially encode subunits of a plant gyrase. We also showed evidence for the existence of supercoiling activity in A. thaliana and that the plant is sensitive to quinolone and aminocoumarin antibiotics, compounds that target DNA gyrase in bacteria. However, it was not possible at that time to show whether the A. thaliana genes encoded an active gyrase enzyme, nor whether that enzyme is indeed the target for the quinolone and aminocoumarin antibiotics. Here we show that an A. thaliana mutant resistant to the quinolone drug ciprofloxacin has a point mutation in ATGYRA. Moreover we show that, as in bacteria, the quinolone-sensitive (wild-type) allele is dominant to the resistant gene. Further we have heterologously expressed ATGYRA and ATGYRB2 in a baculovirus expression system and shown supercoiling activity of the partially purified enzyme. Expression/purification of the quinolone-resistant A. thaliana gyrase yields active enzyme that is resistant to ciprofloxacin. Taken together these experiments now show unequivocally that A. thaliana encodes an organelle-targeted DNA gyrase that is the target of the quinolone drug ciprofloxacin; this has important consequences for plant physiology and the development of herbicides."
https://openalex.org/W2301592716,"The proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblast differentiation are crucial in wound healing and wound closure. Impaired wound healing is often correlated with chronic bacterial contamination of the wound area. A new promising approach to overcome wound contamination, particularly infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens, is the topical treatment with non-thermal ""cold"" atmospheric plasma (CAP). Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) devices generate CAP containing active and reactive species, which have antibacterial effects but also may affect treated tissue/cells. Moreover, DBD treatment acidifies wound fluids and leads to an accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide products, such as nitrite and nitrate, in the wound. Thus, in this paper, we addressed the question of whether DBD-induced chemical changes may interfere with wound healing-relevant cell parameters such as viability, proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation of primary human fibroblasts. DBD treatment of 250 μl buffered saline (PBS) led to a treatment time-dependent acidification (pH 6.7; 300 s) and coincidently accumulation of nitrite (~300 μM), nitrate (~1 mM) and H2O2 (~200 μM). Fibroblast viability was reduced by single DBD treatments (60-300 s; ~77-66%) or exposure to freshly DBD-treated PBS (60-300 s; ~75-55%), accompanied by prolonged proliferation inhibition of the remaining cells. In addition, the total number of myofibroblasts was reduced, whereas in contrast, the myofibroblast frequency was significantly increased 12 days after DBD treatment or exposure to DBD-treated PBS. Control experiments mimicking DBD treatment indicate that plasma-generated H2O2 was mainly responsible for the decreased proliferation and differentiation, but not for DBD-induced toxicity. In conclusion, apart from antibacterial effects, DBD/CAP may mediate biological processes, for example, wound healing by accumulation of H2O2. Therefore, a clinical DBD treatment must be well-balanced in order to avoid possible unwanted side effects such as a delayed healing process."
https://openalex.org/W2300424091,"Densitometry is a powerful tool for the biophysical assessment of the retina. Until recently, this was restricted to bulk spatial scales in living humans. The application of adaptive optics (AO) to the conventional fundus camera and scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) has begun to translate these studies to cellular scales. Here, we employ an AOSLO to perform dynamic photopigment densitometry in order to characterize the optical properties and spectral types of the human cone photoreceptor mosaic. Cone-resolved estimates of optical density and photosensitivity agree well with bulk estimates, although show smaller variability than previously reported. Photopigment kinetics of individual cones derived from their selective bleaching allowed efficient mapping of cone sub-types in human retina. Estimated uncertainty in identifying a cone as long vs middle wavelength was less than 5%, and the total time taken per subject ranged from 3-9 hours. Short wavelength cones were delineated in every subject with high fidelity. The lack of a third cone-type was confirmed in a protanopic subject. In one color normal subject, cone assignments showed 91% correspondence against a previously reported cone-typing method from more than a decade ago. Combined with cone-targeted stimulation, this brings us closer in studying the visual percept arising from a specific cone type and its implication for color vision circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2325281895,"Whereas the roles of the canonical wingless-type MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) integration site family (WNT) signaling pathway in the regulation of ovarian follicle growth and steroidogenesis are now established, noncanonical WNT signaling in the ovary has been largely overlooked. Noncanonical WNTs, including WNT5a and WNT11, are expressed in granulosa cells (GCs) and are differentially regulated throughout follicle development, but their physiologic roles remain unknown. Using conditional gene targeting, we found that GC-specific inactivation of Wnt5a (but not Wnt11) results in the female subfertility associated with increased follicular atresia and decreased rates of ovulation. Microarray analyses have revealed that WNT5a acts to down-regulate the expression of FSH-responsive genes in vitro, and corresponding increases in the expression of these genes have been found in the GCs of conditional knockout mice. Unexpectedly, we found that WNT5a regulates its target genes not by signaling via the WNT/Ca2+ or planar cell polarity pathways, but rather by inhibiting the canonical pathway, causing both β-catenin (CTNNB1) and cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) protein levels to decrease via a glycogen synthase kinase-3β-dependent mechanism. We further found that WNT5a prevents follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing protein from up-regulating the CTNNB1 and CREB proteins and their target genes, indicating that WNT5a functions as a physiologic inhibitor of gonadotropin signaling. Together, these findings identify WNT5a as a key regulator of follicle development and gonadotropin responsiveness.—Abedini, A., Zamberlam, G., Lapointe, E., Tourigny, C., Boyer, A., Paquet, M., Hayashi, K., Honda, H., Kikuchi, A., Price, C., Boerboom, D.

Therefore, changes in Cx36 gap junction coupling could underlie a component of cytokine-induced islet dysfunction in diabetes. Based on the results of these previous studies, we aim to investigate if pro-inflammatory cytokines decrease Cx36 gap junction coupling in the islet and the mechanisms involved in this disruption. Changes in Cx36 gap junction coupling have been shown to be protective against cytokine-induced damage in INS-1E cells (30Allagnat F. Klee P. Cardozo A.K. Meda P. Haefliger J.-A.

Despite this protective mechanism and the importance of Cx36 in regulating insulin release, the regulation of Cx36 gap junction coupling in the islet is poorly understood (32Farnsworth N.L.

Gap junctions are regulated by protein kinases in several tissues (33Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Regulation of gap junctions by phosphorylation of connexins.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). For example, protein kinase A decreases Cx36 gap junction coupling in AII amacrine cells (34Urschel S. Höher T. Schubert T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5368-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of PKCδ in mice has been shown to protect β-cells from cytokine-induced death (38Cantley J. Boslem E. Laybutt D.R. Cordery D.V. Pearson G. Carpenter L. Leitges M. Biden T.J. Deletion of protein kinase Cδ in mice modulates stability of inflammatory genes and protects against cytokine-stimulated beta cell death in vitro and in vivo.Diabetologia. 2011; 54: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore NO-activated PKCδ may participate in the regulation of Cx36 under pro-inflammatory conditions. The goal of this study is to quantify changes in Cx36 gap junction coupling with varying levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and determine the role of PKCδ in modulating cytokine-induced changes in gap junction coupling. Several studies have shown islet dysfunction and extensive cell death with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but lower levels of inflammation, associated with earlier stages of diabetes progression, have not been studied. Therefore this study aims to investigate islet dysfunction over a range of cytokine levels to determine the mechanisms for altered insulin secretion, altered [Ca2+]i signaling dynamics, and disruption to Cx36 gap junction coupling. We specifically test whether low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines decrease gap junction coupling through NO-regulated PKCδ. All experiments using mice were performed in compliance with the guidelines and relevant laws set by the University of Colorado, and were approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were given food and water ad libitum and were housed in a temperature and light controlled facility with 12-h light-dark cycles. A total of 110 C57BL/6NHsd (C57BL/6) mice were used. For all experiments, islets were isolated from 8–16-week-old C57BL/6 mice as previously described (39Scharp D.W. Kemp C.B. Knight M.J. Ballinger W.F. Lacy P.E.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16992-16997Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Islets were cultured overnight in RPMI medium 1640 (Life Technologies) with 10% FBS, 11 mm glucose, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2 before commencing experiments. Human islets were received from the Integrated Islet Distribution Program (donor IDs: AAEZ340, AAJF122, ABAF490, ABCQ166, ABD1375, ABEI419, ABFV041,ABGK387A, ABHC283, ABJR111, and ABJ5204) with a median viability of 90% and an average stimulation index (fold-increase insulin secretion from 2 to 20 mm glucose) of 2.5 for all donors, and were cultured overnight in CMRL medium 1066 (Fisher Scientific) before commencing experiments. Islets were treated for 1 h, 24 h, or 30 min in RPMI medium with 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 times dilutions of a cytokine mixture (termed “relative cytokine concentration” or RCC) consisting of 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 5 ng/ml of recombinant mouse interleukin-1β (IL-1β, R&D Systems), and 100 ng/ml of recombinant mouse interferon-γ (IFN-γ, R&D Systems) (10Dula S.B.

Islets were also treated with individual or combinations of two cytokines at 0.1 RCC for 24 h. Islets were incubated with 4 μm Fluo-4 AM for 2 h at room temperature in imaging buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 2 mm glucose). Islets were imaged in a polymdimethylsiloxane microfluidic device (41Rocheleau J.V. Remedi M.S. Granada B. Head W.S. Koster J.C. Nichols C.G. Piston D.W. Critical role of gap junction coupled KATP channel activity for regulated insulin secretion.PLos Biol. 2006; 4: e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) maintained at 37 °C with an Eclipse-Ti wide field microscope (Nikon) and a ×20 0.75 NA Plan Apo objective. Images were acquired at 1 frame/s for either 5 min after stimulation with 11 mm glucose for 10 min, or continuously for 20 or 50 min from low to high glucose. Fluo-4 was imaged using a 490/40-nm band-pass excitation filter and a 525/36-nm band-pass emission filter (Chroma). Islets were treated for 24 h, 1 h immediately prior to imaging, or 30 min while imaging continuously. The percentage islet area synchronized was determined as previously described (42Hraha T.H. Bernard A.B. Nguyen L.M. Anseth K.S. Benninger R.K. Dimensionality and size scaling of coordinated Ca2+ dynamics in MIN6 β-cell clusters.Biophys.

Peak [Ca2+]i was calculated as the difference in Fluo-4 AM intensity averaged over the entire islet at the peak and trough of each glucose-induced oscillation, normalized to the average intensity at the trough, and averaged over 300- or 400-s intervals. Islets were incubated with a near IR fluorescent reactive dye (Life Technologies) diluted 1:1000 in imaging buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Islets were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a ×40 1.2NA water immersion objective. The dye was excited with a 633-nm helium-neon laser with a UV/488/543/633-nm dichroic beam splitter and images for live/dead cells were collected with a 650–710 nm band-pass emission filter. Viability was calculated from manual counts of live and dead cells averaged over 3 images of increasing depth in each islet. Insulin secretion samples were collected by incubating ∼10 islets in 500 μl of Krebs-Ringer buffer with 2 mm glucose for 1 h, followed by 1 h at 2 mm glucose, 20 mm glucose, or 20 mm glucose plus 20 mm KCl. Supernatant and islet lysate were collected for analysis of insulin secretion and content, respectively. Islets were lysed by freezing in 2% Triton X-100 in deionized water. Insulin was measured with a mouse ultrasensitive insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO) per the manufacturer's instructions, and is reported as secretion (supernatant) normalized to content (lysate) for each sample. FRAP was used to quantify the extent of Cx36 gap junction coupling, as previously described (43Farnsworth N.L. Hemmati A. Pozzoli M. Benninger R.K. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching reveals regulation and distribution of connexin36 gap junction coupling within mouse islets of Langerhans.J. Physiol. 2014; 592: 4431-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, islets were cultured in MatTek dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) coated with CellTak (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and stained with 12.5 μm rhodamine 123 (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Islets were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope with a ×40 1.2NA water immersion objective. Rh123 was excited with an argon laser at 488 nm and images were collected with a 488-nm narrow band-pass dichroic beam splitter, 490-nm long pass secondary dichroic beam splitter, and a 505-nm long pass emission filter. Half of the islet area was photobleached for 235.5 s at 316.05 milliwatt/cm2 and the fluorescence recovery was measured in the bleached area. Recovery rates were calculated from the inverse exponential fluorescence recovery curve for either the entire bleached area or for individual cells in the bleached area. To determine the role of PKCδ in regulating gap junction coupling, islets were cultured with the following treatments: 300 nm PKCδ-specific activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma), or 0.1 RCC with 1 μm of the PKCδ specific inhibitor rottlerin (Sigma) for 1 h. To determine the role of NO in regulating gap junction coupling, islets were cultured with the following treatments: 5 mm of the NO donor molecule S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP, Sigma), 100 mm of the nitric oxide donor molecule diethylamine NONOate (DEANO, Calbiochem), 1 mm of the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 200 μm of the nitric oxide scavenging molecule 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO, Sigma), each for 1 h. For analysis of PKCδ activation by tyrosine phosphorylation, mouse islets were cultured for 24 h with treatments as previously described. Islets (100 per treatment) were washed once in PBS and lysed by sonication for 30 s in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Protein content was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) per the manufacturer's instructions. Non-phosphorylated PKCδ controls were generated by incubating 5 μg of protein from SNAP-treated samples with 5 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP, New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA) in 25 μl of lysis buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were run on 15% TGX pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE Life Sciences). The membrane was blocked in 5% dry milk (Fisher Scientific) in PBS with 1% Tween 20 (Sigma) (PBST) for >2 h, then stained with a rabbit anti-PKCδ primary antibody, which binds to the activated (phosphorylated) form of PKCδ (Y311, Cell Signaling Technologies) diluted 1:1,000 or a monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin primary antibody (NB100–690SS, Novus Biologicals) diluted 1:5,000 at 4 °C for >16 h.

https://openalex.org/W2194464187,"Activation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) by elevating cytosolic Ca2+ is a central step in the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, but the molecular basis of RyR2 activation by cytosolic Ca2+ is poorly defined. It has been proposed recently that the putative Ca2+ binding domain encompassing a pair of EF-hand motifs (EF1 and EF2) in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) functions as a Ca2+ sensor that regulates the gating of RyR1. Although the role of the EF-hand domain in RyR1 function has been studied extensively, little is known about the functional significance of the corresponding EF-hand domain in RyR2. Here we investigate the effect of mutations in the EF-hand motifs on the Ca2+ activation of RyR2. We found that mutations in the EF-hand motifs or deletion of the entire EF-hand domain did not affect the Ca2+-dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding or the cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2. On the other hand, deletion of the EF-hand domain markedly suppressed the luminal Ca2+ activation of RyR2 and spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells during store Ca2+ overload or store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). Furthermore, mutations in the EF2 motif, but not EF1 motif, of RyR2 raised the threshold for SOICR termination, whereas deletion of the EF-hand domain of RyR2 increased both the activation and termination thresholds for SOICR. These results indicate that, although the EF-hand domain is not required for RyR2 activation by cytosolic Ca2+, it plays an important role in luminal Ca2+ activation and SOICR."

Impaired calcium signaling leads to decreased beta cell mass and diabetes. To appreciate the causes of these cytotoxic perturbations, a more detailed understanding of the relevant signaling pathways and their respective gene targets is required. In this study, we examined the calcium-induced expression of the cytoprotective beta cell transcription factor Npas4. Pharmacological inhibition implicated the calcineurin, Akt/protein kinase B, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways in the regulation of Npas4 transcription and translation. Both Npas4 mRNA and protein had high turnover rates, and, at the protein level, degradation was mediated via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Finally, beta cell cytotoxicity of the calcineurin inhibitor and immunosuppressant tacrolimus (FK-506) was prevented by Npas4 overexpression. These results delineate the pathways regulating Npas4 expression and stability and demonstrate its importance in clinical settings such as islet transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2278163172,"SNARE proteins catalyze many forms of biological membrane fusion, including Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. Although fusion mediated by SNAREs generally involves proteins anchored to each fusing membrane by a transmembrane domain (TMD), the role of TMDs remains unclear, and previous studies diverge on whether SNAREs can drive fusion without a TMD. This issue is important because it relates to the question of the structure and composition of the initial fusion pore, as well as the question of whether SNAREs mediate fusion solely by creating close proximity between two membranes versus a more active role in transmitting force to the membrane to deform and reorganize lipid bilayer structure. To test the role of membrane attachment, we generated four variants of the synaptic v-SNARE synaptobrevin-2 (syb2) anchored to the membrane by lipid instead of protein. These constructs were tested for functional efficacy in three different systems as follows: Ca2+-triggered dense core vesicle exocytosis, spontaneous synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and Ca2+-synaptotagmin-enhanced SNARE-mediated liposome fusion. Lipid-anchoring motifs harboring one or two lipid acylation sites completely failed to support fusion in any of these assays. Only the lipid-anchoring motif from cysteine string protein-α, which harbors many lipid acylation sites, provided support for fusion but at levels well below that achieved with wild type syb2. Thus, lipid-anchored syb2 provides little or no support for exocytosis, and anchoring syb2 to a membrane by a TMD greatly improves its function.

Modulation of MNK activity affects translation of mRNAs involved in the cell cycle, cancer progression, and cell survival. However, the mechanism by which MNK selectively affects translation of these mRNAs is not understood. MNK binds eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and phosphorylates the cap-binding protein eIF4E. Using a cell-free translation system from rabbit reticulocytes programmed with mRNAs containing different 5'-ends, we show that an MNK inhibitor, CGP57380, affects translation of only those mRNAs that contain both a cap and a hairpin in the 5'-UTR. Similarly, a C-terminal fragment of human eIF4G-1, eIF4G(1357-1600), which prevents binding of MNK to intact eIF4G, reduces eIF4E phosphorylation and inhibits translation of only capped and hairpin-containing mRNAs. Analysis of proteins bound to m(7)GTP-Sepharose reveals that both CGP and eIF4G(1357-1600) decrease binding of eIF4E to eIF4G. These data suggest that MNK stimulates translation only of mRNAs containing both a cap and 5'-terminal RNA duplex via eIF4E phosphorylation, thereby enhancing the coupled cap-binding and RNA-unwinding activities of eIF4F."

In recent years, much effort has been spent on understanding how insulin regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, whereas the effect of insulin on protein metabolism has received less attention. In diabetes, hepatic production of serum albumin decreases, and it has been long established that insulin positively controls albumin gene expression. In this study, we used a genetic approach in mice to identify the mechanism by which insulin regulates albumin gene transcription. Albumin expression was decreased significantly in livers with insulin signaling disrupted by ablation of the insulin receptor or Akt. Concomitant deletion of Forkhead Box O1 (Foxo1) in these livers rescued the decreased albumin secretion. Furthermore, activation of Foxo1 in the liver is sufficient to suppress albumin expression.

https://openalex.org/W2297276391,"In the last years the chloro-s-triazine active substance terbuthylazine has been increasingly used as an herbicide and may leave residues in the environment which can be of concern. The present study aimed at developing a bioaugmentation tool based on the soil bacterium Arthrobacter aurescens strain TC1 for the remediation of terbuthylazine contaminated soils and at examining its efficacy for both soil and aquatic compartments. First, the feasibility of growing the bioaugmentation bacterium inocula on simple sole nitrogen sources (ammonium and nitrate) instead of atrazine, while still maintaining its efficiency to biodegrade terbuthylazine was shown. In sequence, the successful and quick (3 days) bioremediation efficacy of ammonium-grown A. aurescens TC1 cells was proven in a natural soil freshly spiked or four-months aged with commercial terbuthylazine at a dose 10× higher than the recommended in corn cultivation, to mimic spill situations. Ecotoxicity assessment of the soil eluates towards a freshwater microalga supported the effectiveness of the bioaugmentation tool. Obtained results highlight the potential to decontaminate soil while minimizing terbuthylazine from reaching aquatic compartments via the soil-water pathway. The usefulness of this bioaugmentation tool to provide rapid environment decontamination is particularly relevant in the event of accidental high herbicide contamination. Its limitations and advantages are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2285155704,"Embryo implantation requires that the uterus differentiate into the receptive state. Failure to attain uterine receptivity will impede blastocyst attachment and result in a compromised pregnancy. The molecular mechanism by which the uterus transitions from the prereceptive to the receptive stage is complex, involving an intricate interplay of various molecules. We recently found that mice with uterine deletion of Msx genes (Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d) are infertile because of implantation failure associated with heightened apicobasal polarity of luminal epithelial cells during the receptive period. However, information on Msx's roles in regulating epithelial polarity remains limited. To gain further insight, we analyzed cell-type-specific gene expression by RNA sequencing of separated luminal epithelial and stromal cells by laser capture microdissection from Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d and floxed mouse uteri on d 4 of pseudopregnancy. We found that claudin-1, a tight junction protein, and small proline-rich (Sprr2) protein, a major component of cornified envelopes in keratinized epidermis, were substantially up-regulated in Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d uterine epithelia. These factors also exhibited unique epithelial expression patterns at the implantation chamber (crypt) in Msx1f/f/Msx2f/f females; the patterns were lost in Msx1d/d/Msx2d/d epithelia on d 5, suggesting important roles during implantation. The results suggest that Msx genes play important roles during uterine receptivity including modulation of epithelial junctional activity.—Sun, X., Park, C. B., Deng, W., Potter, S. S., Dey, S. K.

https://openalex.org/W2221679204,"Fabry disease is caused by deficient activity of α-galactosidase A (GLA) and characterized by systemic accumulation of glycosphingolipids, substrates of the enzyme. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of Fabry disease based on accumulated substrates, we examined the tissue and plasma distributions of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) isoforms, and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and its analogues in a GLA knockout mouse, a model of Fabry disease, by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The results revealed that the contents of these substrates in the liver, kidneys, heart, and plasma of GLA knockout mice were apparently higher than in those of wild-type ones, and organ specificity in the accumulation of Gb3 isoforms was found. Especially in the kidneys, accumulation of a large amount of Gb3 isoforms including hydroxylated residues was found. In the GLA knockout mice, the proportion of hydrophobic Gb3 isoforms was apparently higher than that in the wild-type mice. On the other hand, hydrophilic residues were abundant in plasma. Unlike that of Gb3, the concentration of lyso-Gb3 was high in the liver, and the lyso-Gb3/Gb3 ratio in plasma was significantly higher than those in the organs. The concentration of lyso-Gb3 was apparently higher than those of its analogues in the organs and plasma from both the GLA knockout and wild-type mice. This information will be useful for elucidating the basis of Fabry disease."
https://openalex.org/W2230545752,"For ages, specialists from varying fields have studied the diets of the primeval inhabitants of our planet, detecting diet remains in archaeological specimens using a range of morphological and biochemical methods. As of recent, metagenomic ancient DNA studies have allowed for the comparison of the fecal and gut microbiomes associated to archaeological specimens from various regions of the world; however the complex dynamics represented in those microbial communities still remain unclear. Theoretically, similar to eukaryote DNA the presence of genes from key microbes or enzymes, as well as the presence of DNA from viruses specific to key organisms, may suggest the ingestion of specific diet components. In this study we demonstrate that ancient virus DNA obtained from coprolites also provides information reconstructing the host’s diet, as inferred from sequences obtained from pre-Columbian coprolites. This depicts a novel and reliable approach to determine new components as well as validate the previously suggested diets of extinct cultures and animals. Furthermore, to our knowledge this represents the first description of the eukaryotic viral diversity found in paleofaeces belonging to pre-Columbian cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2414422246,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling regulates angiogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms by which structural changes in ECM proteins contribute to angiogenesis are not fully understood. Integrins are molecules with the ability to detect compositional and structural changes within the ECM and integrate this information into a network of signaling circuits that coordinate context-dependent cell behavior. The role of integrin αvβ3 in angiogenesis is complex, as evidence exists for both positive and negative functions. The precise downstream signaling events initiated by αvβ3 may depend on the molecular characteristics of its ligands. Here, we identified an RGD-containing cryptic collagen epitope that is generated in vivo. Surprisingly, rather than inhibiting αvβ3 signaling, this collagen epitope promoted αvβ3 activation and stimulated angiogenesis and inflammation. An antibody directed to this RGDKGE epitope but not other RGD collagen epitopes inhibited angiogenesis and inflammation in vivo. The selective ability of this RGD epitope to promote angiogenesis and inflammation depends in part on its flanking KGE motif. Interestingly, a subset of macrophages may represent a physiologically relevant source of this collagen epitope. Here, we define an endothelial cell mechano-signaling pathway in which a cryptic collagen epitope activates αvβ3 leading to an Src and p38 MAPK-dependent cascade that leads to nuclear accumulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and stimulation of endothelial cell growth. Collectively, our findings not only provide evidence for a novel mechano-signaling pathway, but also define a possible therapeutic strategy to control αvβ3 signaling by targeting a pro-angiogenic and inflammatory ligand of αvβ3 rather than the receptor itself."
https://openalex.org/W2208745900,"Presence of an air pocket and its size play an important role in survival of victims buried in the avalanche snow. Even small air pockets facilitate breathing. We hypothesize that the size of the air pocket significantly affects the airflow resistance and work of breathing. The aims of the study are (1) to investigate the effect of the presence of an air pocket on gas exchange and work of breathing in subjects breathing into the simulated avalanche snow and (2) to test whether it is possible to breathe with no air pocket. The prospective interventional double-blinded study involved 12 male volunteers, from which 10 completed the whole protocol. Each volunteer underwent two phases of the experiment in a random order: phase ""AP""--breathing into the snow with a one-liter air pocket, and phase ""NP""--breathing into the snow with no air pocket. Physiological parameters, fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the airways and work of breathing expressed as pressure-time product were recorded continuously. The main finding of the study is that it is possible to breath in the avalanche snow even with no air pocket (0 L volume), but breathing under this condition is associated with significantly increased work of breathing. The significant differences were initially observed for end-tidal values of the respiratory gases (EtO2 and EtCO2) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) between AP and NP phases, whereas significant differences in inspiratory fractions occurred much later (for FIO2) or never (for FICO2). The limiting factor in no air pocket conditions is excessive increase in work of breathing that induces increase in metabolism accompanied by higher oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. The presence of even a small air pocket reduces significantly the work of breathing."
https://openalex.org/W2293462659,"Proline-rich oligopeptides (PROs) are a large family which comprises the bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs). They inhibit the activity of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and have a typical pyroglutamyl (Pyr)/proline-rich structure at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. Furthermore, PROs decrease blood pressure in animals. In the present study, the isolation and biological characterization of a novel vasoactive BPP isolated from the skin secretion of the frog Brachycephalus ephippium is described. This new PRO, termed BPP-Brachy, has the primary structure WPPPKVSP and the amidated form termed BPP-BrachyNH2 inhibits efficiently ACE in rat serum. In silico molecular modeling and docking studies suggest that BPP-BrachyNH2 is capable of forming a hydrogen bond network as well as multiple van der Waals interactions with the rat ACE, which blocks the access of the substrate to the C-domain active site. Moreover, in rat thoracic aorta BPP-BrachyNH2 induces potent endothelium-dependent vasodilatation with similar magnitude as captopril. In DAF-FM DA-loaded aortic cross sections examined by confocal microscopy, BPP-BrachyNH2 was found to increase the release of nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, BPP-BrachyNH2 was devoid of toxicity in endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures. In conclusion, the peptide BPP-BrachyNH2 has a novel sequence being the first BPP isolated from the skin secretion of the Brachycephalidae family. This opens for exploring amphibians as a source of new biomolecules. The BPP-BrachyNH2 is devoid of cytotoxicity and elicits endothelium-dependent vasodilatation mediated by NO. These findings open for the possibility of potential application of these peptides in the treatment of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2302361826,"Ovarian and pancreatic cancers are two of the most aggressive and lethal cancers, whose management faces only limited therapeutic options. Typically, these tumors spread insidiously accompanied first with atypical symptoms, and usually shift to a drug resistance phenotype with the current pharmaceutical armamentarium. Thus, the development of new drugs acting via a different mechanism of action represents a clear priority. Herein, we are reporting for the first time that the aminosteroid derivative RM-133, developed in our laboratory, displays promising activity on two models of aggressive cancers, namely ovarian (OVCAR-3) and pancreatic (PANC-1) cancers. The IC50 value of RM-133 was 0.8 μM and 0.3 μM for OVCAR-3 and PANC-1 cell lines in culture, respectively. Based on pharmacokinetic studies on RM-133 using 11 different vehicles, we selected two main vehicles: aqueous 0.4% methylcellulose:ethanol (92:8) and sunflower oil:ethanol (92:8) for in vivo studies. Using subcutaneous injection of RM-133 with the methylcellulose-based vehicle, growth of PANC-1 tumors xenografted to nude mice was inhibited by 63%. Quite interestingly, RM-133 injected subcutaneously with the methylcellulose-based or sunflower-based vehicles reduced OVCAR-3 xenograft growth by 122% and 100%, respectively. After the end of RM-133 treatment using the methylcellulose-based vehicle, OVCAR-3 tumor growth inhibition was maintained for ≥ 1 week. RM-133 was also well tolerated in the whole animal, no apparent sign of toxicity having been detected in the xenograft studies."

Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared our DUR when the PICU team was exposed and unexposed (champion's maternity leaves) to a physician safety champion. Hospital acquired infection (HAI) surveillance of all PICU admissions between April 1st 2009 and June 29th 2013 was done prospectively. To ensure stable acuity of the patient population over time, we used the central venous catheter (CVC) DUR as a control.The urinary catheter DUR was 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.45) during the unexposed period versus 0.39 (95%CI 0.38-0.40) during the exposed period, for an absolute difference of 0.05 (95%CI 0.03-0.06; p<0.0001). The overall CVC DUR increased from 0.57 (95%CI 0.55-0.58) during the unexposed period to 0.63 (95%CI 0.61-0.64) during the exposed period, an absolute increase of 0.06 (95%CI 0.04-0.08; p<0.0001). Comparing the exposed and unexposed periods, adjusting for time trend, we observed a 17% decrease in the urinary catheter DUR when the safety champion was present (odds ratio [OR] 0.83; 95%CI 0.77-0.90). The rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infections did not change.The presence of a unit-based safety champion can have a positive impact on urinary catheter DUR in a PICU."
https://openalex.org/W2215176793,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a well-known devastating lesion that sadly is very resistant to all treatment attempts. This fact has stimulated the exploration of multiple regenerative strategies that are examined at both the basic and clinical level. For laboratory research, differentin vivomodels are used, but each has many important limitations. The main limitation of these models is the high level of animal suffering related to the inflicted neurologic injury. It has caused a growing tendency to limit the injury, but this, in turn, produces incomplete SCI models and uncertainties in the neuroregeneration interpretation. To overcome such limitations, a new experimental SCI model is proposed. Geckos have been extensively examined as a potential animal model of SCI. Their spinal cord extends into the tail and can be transected without causing the typical neurologic consequences observed in rat models. In this study, we compared the gecko tail SCI model with the rat model of thoracic SCI. Anatomic and histologic analyses showed comparability between the gecko and rat in diameter of spinal canal and spinal cord, as well as applicability of multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin, immunostaining, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy). We tested the suitability ofin vivostudy with 3 prototype implants for the reconstruction of SCI: a multichannel sponge, a multilaminar tube, and a gel cylinder. These were compared with a spinal cord excision (control). A 20-wk observation revealed no adverse effects of SCI on the animals' well-being. The animals were easily housed and observed. Histologic analysis showed growth of nervous tissue elements on implant surface and implant cellular colonization. The study showed that the gecko SCI model can be used as a primary model for the assessment of SCI treatment methods. It provides a platform for testing multiple solutions with limited animal suffering before performing tests on mammals. Detailed results of the experimental conditions and testing techniques are provided.-Szarek, D., Marycz, K., Lis, A., Zawada, Z., Tabakow, P., Laska, J., Jarmundowicz, W.

The foveal morphologic changes were examined via optical coherence tomography (OCT). At initial examination, 63 eyes exhibited subfoveal hemorrhage. At final examination, the defect lengths in the foveal external limiting membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid lines in these eyes were longer, and final VA was significantly poorer, compared with eyes without subfoveal hemorrhage. In comparisons between the final measurements in eyes with subfoveal hemorrhage in the IVR(-) and IVR(+) groups, while there were no differences in initial ocular conditions, final VA was significantly better in the IVR(+) group. The defects in the ELM and ellipsoid lines in the IVR(+) group were shorter than those of the IVR(-) group (p = 0.002 in both). Final VA was correlated with the defect lengths of foveal ELM and ellipsoid lines in both the IVR(-) and IVR(+) groups (both p < 0.001). In addition, the defect lengths of foveal ELM and ellipsoid lines were closely correlated with the duration of subfoveal hemorrhage (both p < 0.001). BRVO-associated subfoveal hemorrhage caused damage to the foveal photoreceptors, and visual dysfunction. However, IVR improved these prognoses, by accelerating the absorption of the subfoveal hemorrhage."

https://openalex.org/W2212697196,"Background Attention is restricted for the second of two targets when it is presented within 200–500 ms of the first target. This attentional blink (AB) phenomenon allows one to study the dynamics of temporal selective attention by varying the interval between the two targets (T1 and T2). Whereas the AB has long been considered as a robust and universal cognitive limitation, several studies have demonstrated that AB task performance greatly differs between individuals, with some individuals showing no AB whatsoever. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we studied these individual differences in AB task performance in relation to differences in attentional timing. Furthermore, we investigated whether AB magnitude is predictive for the amount of attention allocated to T1. For both these purposes pupil dilation was measured, and analyzed with our recently developed deconvolution method. We found that the dynamics of temporal attention in small versus large blinkers differ in a number of ways. Individuals with a relatively small AB magnitude seem better able to preserve temporal order information. In addition, they are quicker to allocate attention to both T1 and T2 than large blinkers. Although a popular explanation of the AB is that it is caused by an unnecessary overinvestment of attention allocated to T1, a more complex picture emerged from our data, suggesting that this may depend on whether one is a small or a large blinker. Conclusion The use of pupil dilation deconvolution seems to be a powerful approach to study the temporal dynamics of attention, bringing us a step closer to understanding the elusive nature of the AB. We conclude that the timing of attention to targets may be more important than the amount of allocated attention in accounting for individual differences."

Alcohol consumption is a modifiable behavior that is linked to increased breast cancer risks and is associated with the development of hormone-dependent breast cancers as well as disease progression and recurrence following endocrine treatment. In this study we examined the molecular mechanisms of action of alcohol by applying molecular, genetic, and genomic approaches in characterizing its effects on estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. Treatments with alcohol promoted cell proliferation, increased growth factor signaling, and up-regulated the transcription of the ER target gene GREB1 but not the canonical target TFF1/pS2. Microarray analysis following alcohol treatment identified a large number of alcohol-responsive genes, including those which function in apoptotic and cell proliferation pathways. Furthermore, expression profiles of the responsive gene sets in tumors were strongly associated with clinical outcomes in patients who received endocrine therapy. Correspondingly, alcohol treatment attenuated the anti-proliferative effects of the endocrine therapeutic drug tamoxifen in ER-positive breast cancer cells. To determine the contribution and functions of responsive genes, their differential expression in tumors were assessed between outcome groups. The proto-oncogene BRAF was identified as a novel alcohol- and estrogen-induced gene that showed higher expression in patients with poor outcomes. Knock-down of BRAF, moreover, prevented the proliferation of breast cancer cells. These findings not only highlight the mechanistic basis of the effects of alcohol on breast cancer cells and increased risks for disease incidents and recurrence, but may facilitate the discovery and characterization of novel oncogenic pathways and markers in breast cancer research and therapeutics."

Methods Outpatient and laboratory claims were analyzed from two databases: all Medicaid claims from six states and all claims from Medicaid health plans from four other states and a large national convenience sample of patients with commercial insurance in the United States. We excluded those aged <13 years and >64 years, enrolled <9 of the 12 months, pregnant females, and previously diagnosed with HIV. We identified patients with new HIV diagnoses that followed (did not precede) the HIV test, using HIV ICD-9 codes. HIV testing percentages were assessed by patient demographics and other tests or diagnoses that occurred during the same visit. Results During 2012, 89,242 of 2,069,536 patients (4.3%) with Medicaid had at least one HIV test, and 850 (1.0%) of those tested received a new HIV diagnosis. Among 27,206,804 patients with commercial insurance, 757,646 (2.8%) had at least one HIV test, and 5,884 (0.8%) of those tested received a new HIV diagnosis. During visits that included an HIV test, 80.2% of Medicaid and 83.0% of commercial insurance claims also included a test or diagnosis for a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and/or Hepatitis B or C virus at the same visit. Conclusions HIV testing primarily took place concurrently with screening or diagnoses for STIs or Hepatitis B or C. We found little evidence to suggest routine screening for HIV infection was widespread."

PP1 also associates with NCX1; however, the molecular basis of this association is unknown. In this study, we aimed to analyze the mechanisms of PP1 targeting to the NCX1-pSer-68-PLM complex and hypothesized that a direct and functional NCX1-PP1 interaction is a prerequisite for pSer-68-PLM dephosphorylation. Using a variety of molecular techniques, we show that PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) co-localized, co-fractionated, and co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1 in rat cardiomyocytes, left ventricle lysates, and HEK293 cells. Bioinformatic analysis, immunoprecipitations, mutagenesis, pulldown experiments, and peptide arrays constrained PP1c anchoring to the K(I/V)FF motif in the first Ca2+ binding domain (CBD) 1 in NCX1. This binding site is also partially in agreement with the extended PP1-binding motif K(V/I)FF-X5–8Φ1Φ2-X8–9-R. The cytosolic loop of NCX1, containing the K(I/V)FF motif, had no effect on PP1 activity in an in vitro assay. Dephosphorylation of pSer-68-PLM in HEK293 cells was not observed when NCX1 was absent, when the K(I/V)FF motif was mutated, or when the PLM- and PP1c-binding sites were separated (mimicking calpain cleavage of NCX1). Co-expression of PLM and NCX1 inhibited NCX1 current (both modes). Moreover, co-expression of PLM with NCX1(F407P) (mutated K(I/V)FF motif) resulted in the current being completely abolished.

The sodium (Na+)-calcium (Ca2+) exchanger (NCX) 3The abbreviations used are: NCX, Na+-Ca2+ exchanger; PLM, phospholemman; pSer-68-PLM, serine 68-phosphorylated phospholemman; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; NKA, Na+/K+-ATPase; TM, transmembrane domains; CBD, Ca2+ binding domain; HF, heart failure; LV, left ventricle; ABHF, aortic banding animals with congestive heart failure; SHAM, sham-operated animals; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; FL, full-length; IP, immunoprecipitation; TEV, tobacco etch virus; PDB, Protein Data Bank; TF, trigger factor; His, His6. is a bidirectional ion-transporting membrane protein, which exchanges three Na+ for one Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. Its mode of operation and activity are determined by the ion concentration gradients and membrane potential (1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Sodium/calcium exchange: its physiological implications.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are three distinct genes that control the expression of three NCX isoforms (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (2Lee S.L. Yu A.S. Lytton J.

Among these, NCX1 is highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, where it modulates excitation-contraction coupling and mediates Ca2+ removal during diastole (4Bers D.M. Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3342) Google Scholar).

Sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX): molecular hallmarks underlying the tissue-specific and systemic functions.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consequently, modulation of NCX1 activity constitutes a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of HF (9Sipido K.R. Volders P.G. Vos M.A. Verdonck F.

The eukaryotic exchanger is composed of 10 transmembrane domains (TM) (11Ren X. Philipson K.D. The topology of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1.J. Mol. Cell.

Deletion of the cytosolic loop has revealed that it does not play a direct role in ion translocation, but rather it mediates regulation of the exchanger by associating with various cytosolic factors (13Matsuoka S.

It has been suggested that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rather occur on accessory proteins in the NCX1 macromolecular complex, enabling fine-tuning of signals that converge on NCX1 (17Schulze D.H.

Fuller W. Howie J. Shattock M.J. Pavlovic D. Phospholemman-dependent regulation of the cardiac Na/K-ATPase activity is modulated by inhibitor-1 sensitive type-1 phosphatase.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 4467-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The latter is a ubiquitously expressed ∼38.5-kDa serine/threonine phosphatase that counters the effects of serine/threonine kinases and has little intrinsic specificity for its substrates (29O'Connell N. Nichols S.R. Heroes E. Beullens M. Bollen M. Peti W. Page R. The molecular basis for substrate specificity of the nuclear NIPP1:PP1 holoenzyme.Structure. 2012; 20: 1746-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes encode four distinct catalytic subunits of PP1 as follows: PP1α, PP1β/δ, and the splice variants PP1cγ1 and PP1cγ2 (30Peti W. Nairn A.C. Page R. Structural basis for protein phosphatase 1 regulation and specificity.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 596-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The isoforms show 85% sequence identity, but the N- and C-terminal extremities show amino acid differences (30Peti W. Nairn A.C. Page R. Structural basis for protein phosphatase 1 regulation and specificity.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 596-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit (PP1c) achieves substrate specificity by forming holoenzymes with more than 200 targeting proteins (31Bollen M. Peti W. Ragusa M.J. Beullens M. The extended PP1 toolkit: designed to create specificity.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 450-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These targeting proteins localize PP1c to specific subcellular domains and fine-tune its activity, allowing for substrate-specific effects (31Bollen M. Peti W. Ragusa M.J. Beullens M. The extended PP1 toolkit: designed to create specificity.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 450-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). More than 90% of targeting proteins interact with PP1c via a short degenerate RVXF-docking motif (32Wakula P. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18817-18823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which serves as an anchor for the initial recruitment of PP1c. Although dephosphorylation of pSer-68-PLM, by PP1c, was recently shown to modulate pSer-68-PLM regulation of NKA (28El-Armouche A. Wittköpper K. Fuller W. Howie J. Shattock M.J. Pavlovic D.

In this study, we investigated whether a direct and functional NCX1-PP1c interaction is a prerequisite for pSer-68-PLM dephosphorylation. Bioinformatic and biomolecular approaches were used to investigate this hypothesis. We aimed to map the PP1c-targeting site on the NCX1 macromolecular complex and elucidate the biological effect of this interaction on NCX1 activity. Animal experiments were approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Committee (FOTS ID 3820) and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). Male Wistar rats (Møllergaard Breeding and Research Center, Skensved, Denmark) weighing ∼170 g were subjected to aortic banding, as described previously (33Brattelid T. Qvigstad E. Birkeland J.A.

In short, anesthesia was induced in a chamber containing a mixture of 68% N2O, 28% O2, and 4% isoflurane. After endotracheal intubation, ventilation was performed with a respirator (Zoovent, Triumph Technical Services, Milton Keynes, UK), and anesthesia was maintained by administration of a mixture of 69% N2O, 29% O2, and 2% isoflurane. The chest was opened in the right second intercostal space, and the ascending aorta was carefully dissected. A significant stenosis was induced by a tight banding of the ascending aorta with a 3.0 silk suture. In sham-operated animals (SHAM), the silk suture around the ascending aorta was not tightened. Buprenorphine was administered for postoperative analgesia. After 6 weeks, echocardiography was performed with a Vevo 2100 (Fujifilm VisualSonics, Canada), and short and long axis images of the left ventricle (LV) and atrium were obtained. The flow through the mitral and aortic valve was measured. Aortic banding animals with congestive heart failure (ABHF) were selected based on echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and post-mortem analysis. The criteria for inclusion in the ABHF group were increased posterior wall diameter (>1.9 mm), increased LV weight (>0.75 g), increased lung weight (>2.5 g), and increased left atrial diameter (>5.0 mm) (34Lunde I.G.

Genomics. 2012; 44: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The SHAM group served as control. All LV samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until analysis. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old Wistar rats. The LV was enzymatically digested in a collagenase solution. The cell mix was transferred onto uncoated culture flasks and incubated for 20 min. Unattached cardiomyocytes were seeded onto 6-well culture plates coated with 0.2% gelatin (G1890, Sigma) and 0.1% fibronectin (F1141, Sigma). The seeding density was 3.75 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (DMEM) (D1152, Sigma) supplemented with Medium 199 (M2520, Sigma), penicillin/streptomycin (P0781, Sigma), horse serum (14-403E, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) (14-701F, BioWhittaker). The cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h until used in protein fractionation experiments. Rats were anesthetized in a chamber filled with 95% room air and 5% isoflurane (Abbott Scandinavia Ab, Solna, Sweden) and were subsequently sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Hearts were then quickly excised and placed in ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl solution with heparin (Heparin LEO, 5000 IE/ml; Orifarm AS, Norway). The aorta was then cannulated and retrogradely perfused with a cell isolation buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 22 mm d-glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 (all chemicals from Sigma) to wash out the blood. The heart was thereafter perfused with cell isolation buffer containing 200 units/ml collagenase type II (Worthington) and 0.1 mm Ca2+. After 20 min of perfusion, the heart was cut down, and the atria and right ventricle were removed. The LV was minced and gently shaken at 37 °C for 3–4 min in the same solution used in the perfusion, but with addition of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (A9647, Sigma) and 0.02 units/ml deoxyribonuclease I (LS002006, Worthington). The digested ventricular tissue was then filtered (200-μm nylon mesh), and cardiomyocytes were sedimented. The cardiomyocyte pellet was resuspended in cell isolation buffer with 1% BSA (A9647, Sigma) and 0.1 mm Ca2+ in the solution. Isolated cardiomyocytes were kept at room temperature until used.

Frozen rat LV lysates were pulverized in a mortar with liquid nitrogen before transfer to lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% TritonTM X-100 (X100–500ML, Sigma)) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF (93482, Sigma) and a Complete Mini EDTA-free tablet (11836170001, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Tissue samples were homogenized three times for 1 min on ice with a Polytron 1200 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and stored at −70 °C until analysis. LVs from rat heart and neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures were fractionated using the compartment protein extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (2145, Merck Millipore Billerica, MA). The supernatants from cytosolic and/or membrane fractions were collected and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations, where applicable, was determined by the Micro BCA protein assay kit (23235, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cloning and mutations of NCX1, PP1, and PLM constructs were performed by Genscript Corp. The primary sequence numbering in all NCX variants includes the signal peptide sequence. The MGC mouse clone BC079673 was used for NCX1 constructs. WT NCX1 full-length (FL) was cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) or into the first reading frame of pAdTrack-cytomegalovirus (CMV) shuttle vector (plasmid 16405, Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Ala mutants (I406A and F408A or K405A and F407A) were mutated into NCX1/pEGFP-N1. A Pro substitution mutant (F407P) was cloned into NCX1/pEGFP-N1. Deletion mutants of the cytoplasmic loop of NCX1, NCX1(243–787), NCX1(243–705), NCX1(243–532), NCX1(243–402), and NCX1(Δ399–424), were cloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). The rat catalytic subunit (P62138) was used for PP1 constructs, and an N-terminal FLAG and His6 tag were inserted. FLAG-His6-PP1c(1–330) and deletion mutants FLAG-His6-PP1c(1–212), FLAG-His6-PP1c(1–149), and FLAG-His6-PP1c(Δ232–263) were cloned into pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). Single and double glycine mutants of FLAG-His6-PP1c (L243G,F257G) were mutated into pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Mouse PLM (AF089734) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen) by Genscript Corp.

https://openalex.org/W2191431880,"Although ribosomal RNA represents the majority of cellular RNA, and ribosome synthesis is closely connected to cell growth and proliferation rates, a complete understanding of the factors that influence transcription of ribosomal DNA is lacking. Here, we show that the THO complex positively affects transcription by RNA polymerase I (Pol I). We found that THO physically associates with the rDNA repeat and interacts genetically with Pol I transcription initiation factors. Pol I transcription in hpr1 or tho2 null mutants is dramatically reduced to less than 20% of the WT level. Pol I occupancy of the coding region of the rDNA in THO mutants is decreased to ~50% of WT level. Furthermore, although the percentage of active rDNA repeats remains unaffected in the mutant cells, the overall rDNA copy number increases ~2-fold compared with WT. Together, these data show that perturbation of THO function impairs transcription initiation and elongation by Pol I, identifying a new cellular target for the conserved THO complex."
https://openalex.org/W2196780263,"Aims Recent evidence shows the rigidity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) contributes to vascular mechanics. Arterial rigidity is an independent cardiovascular risk factor whose associated modifications in VSMC viscoelasticity have never been investigated. This study’s objective was to evaluate if the arterial rigidity risk factors aging, African ancestry, female sex, smoking and diabetes mellitus are associated with VMSC stiffening in an experimental model using a human derived vascular smooth muscle primary cell line repository. Methods Eighty patients subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled. VSMCs were extracted from internal thoracic artery fragments and mechanically evaluated using Optical Magnetic Twisting Cytometry assay. The obtained mechanical variables were correlated with the clinical variables: age, gender, African ancestry, smoking and diabetes mellitus. Results The mechanical variables Gr, G’r and G”r had a normal distribution, demonstrating an inter-individual variability of VSMC viscoelasticity, which has never been reported before. Female sex and smoking were independently associated with VSMC stiffening: Gr (apparent cell stiffness) p = 0.022 and p = 0.018, R2 0.164; G’r (elastic modulus) p = 0.019 and p = 0.009, R2 0.184 and G”r (dissipative modulus) p = 0.011 and p = 0.66, R2 0.141. Conclusion Female sex and smoking are independent predictors of VSMC stiffening. This pro-rigidity effect represents an important element for understanding the vascular rigidity observed in post-menopausal females and smokers, as well as a potential therapeutic target to be explored in the future. There is a significant inter-individual variation of VSMC viscoelasticity, which is slightly modulated by clinical variables and probably relies on molecular factors."

ADAMTS-5 is the major aggrecanase in mouse cartilage, and is also likely to be the major aggrecanase in humans. ADAMTS-5 is a multidomain enzyme, but the function of the C-terminal ancillary domains is poorly understood. We show that mutant ADAMTS-5 lacking the catalytic domain, but with a full suite of ancillary domains inhibits wild type ADAMTS activity, in vitro and in vivo, in a dominant-negative manner. The data suggest that mutant ADAMTS-5 binds to wild type ADAMTS-5; thus we tested the hypothesis that ADAMTS-5 associates to form oligomers. Co-elution, competition, and in situ PLA experiments using full-length and truncated recombinant ADAMTS-5 confirmed that ADAMTS-5 molecules interact, and showed that the catalytic and disintegrin-like domains support these intermolecular interactions. Cross-linking experiments revealed that recombinant ADAMTS-5 formed large, reduction-sensitive oligomers with a nominal molecular mass of ∼400 kDa. The oligomers were unimolecular and proteolytically active. ADAMTS-5 truncates comprising the disintegrin and/or catalytic domains were able to competitively block full-length ADAMTS-5-mediated aggrecan cleavage, measured by production of the G1-EGE373 neoepitope. These results show that ADAMTS-5 oligomerization is required for full aggrecanase activity, and they provide evidence that blocking oligomerization inhibits ADAMTS-5 activity. The data identify the surface provided by the catalytic and disintegrin-like domains of ADAMTS-5 as a legitimate target for the design of aggrecanase inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2207483200,"We show here, by using surface biotinylation, followed by Western blotting or surface plasmon resonance analysis, that very low levels of S100A8 and/or S100A9 can be detected on the surface of THP-1 cells or freshly isolated human monocytes. This was supported by immune-electron microscopy where we observed membrane-associated expression of the proteins restricted to small patches. By using confocal microscopy we could determine that S100A8 and S100A9 protein in THP-1 cells or freshly isolated human monocytes was mostly present in vesicular structures. This finding was confirmed using immune-electron microscopy. Subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy showed that these vesicular structures are mainly early endosomes and endolysosomes. Our subsequent studies showed that accumulation of S100A8 and S100A9 in the endolysosomal compartment is associated with induction of their release from the cells. Furthermore, an inhibitor of lysosomal activity could modulate the release of S100A8 and S100A9 in the extracellular milieu. Our current results suggest that the S100A8 and S100A9 proteins are primarily associated with certain kinds of cytosolic vesicles and may be secreted via an endolysosomal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2299378500,"Traumas, infections, tumors, and some congenital malformations can lead to bone defects or even bone loss. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether inclusion of endothelial progenitor cells derived from peripheral blood (PB–EPCs) in cell-seeded partially deproteinized bone (PDPB) implants would stimulate recruitment of systemically injected bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to the implant. Methods: BMSCs were injected intravenously with lentiviral expression vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for tracing. Recruitment of eGFP-positive BMSCs was tested for the following implant configurations: 1) seeded with both BMSC and PB-EPC, 2) BMSC alone, 3) PB-EPC alone, and 4) unseeded PDPB. Protein and mRNA levels of endogenous stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4, as well as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and its receptor CCR2, were evaluated on the 8th week. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine eGFP-positive areas at the defective sites. Masson’s trichrome staining was conducted to observe the distribution of collagen deposition and evaluate the extent of osteogenesis. Results: The mRNA and protein levels of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in the co-culture group were higher than those in other groups (p < 0.05) 8 weeks after the surgery. MCP-1 mRNA level in the co-culture group was also higher than that in the other groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical assays revealed that the area covered by eGFP-positive cells was larger in the co-culture group than in the other groups (p < 0.05) after 4 weeks. Masson’s trichrome staining revealed better osteogenic potential of the co-culture group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These experiments demonstrate an association between PB-EPC and BMSC recruitment mediated by the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis that can enhance repair of bone defects."
https://openalex.org/W2346576155,"A signature event during the cell intrinsic apoptotic pathway is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to formation of the apoptosome, a caspase activation complex. The cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (CAS) can facilitate apoptosome assembly by stimulating nucleotide exchange on Apaf-1 following binding of cytochrome c. We report here that CAS expression itself is up-regulated during tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis, and knockdown of CAS renders cells resistant to TRAIL. We find that TRAIL induces up-regulation of CAS in a posttranscriptional, caspase-8-dependent manner through degradation of cIAP1, an E3 ligase that targets CAS for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. We identified a novel signaling pathway whereby caspase-8 engages a feedforward cascade that leads to CAS up-regulation and amplifies the apoptotic signal. Furthermore, in silico analysis revealed that expression of CAS is up-regulated at both the mRNA and DNA levels in human breast tumors, consistent with its role in promoting cell proliferation. Overexpression of various oncogenes led to CAS up-regulation in non-transformed cells. Intriguingly, oncogene-induced CAS up-regulation also resulted in greater susceptibility to TRAIL-induced cell death, consistent with its proapoptotic function. These findings suggest that CAS plays contrasting roles in proliferation and apoptosis and that overexpression of CAS in tumors could serve as a potential biomarker to guide therapeutic choices."
https://openalex.org/W2300237204,"Aurora B and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) collaborate to ensure the proper biorientation of chromosomes during mitosis. However, lack of Aurora B activity and inactivation of the SAC have a very different impact on chromosome segregation. This is most evident in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, since in this organism the lack of Aurora B is lethal and leads to severe aneuploidy problems, while the SAC is dispensable under normal growth conditions and mutants in this checkpoint do not show evident chromosome segregation defects. We demonstrate that the efficient repair of incorrect chromosome attachments by Aurora B during the initial stages of spindle assembly in budding yeast determines the lack of chromosome segregation defects in SAC mutants, and propose that the differential time window that Aurora B kinase requires to establish chromosome biorientation is the key factor that determines why some cells are more dependent on a functional SAC than others."
https://openalex.org/W2203501604,"Sodium absorption in epithelial cells is rate-limited by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in lung, kidney, and the distal colon. Pathophysiological conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and Liddle syndrome, result from water-electrolyte imbalance partly due to malfunction of ENaC regulation. Because the quaternary structure of ENaC is yet undetermined, the bases of pathologically linked mutations in ENaC subunits α, β, and γ are largely unknown. Here, we present a structural model of heterotetrameric ENaC α1βα2γ that is consistent with previous cross-linking results and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. By using this model, we show that the disease-causing mutation αW493R rewires structural dynamics of the intersubunit interfaces α1β and α2γ. Changes in dynamics can allosterically propagate to the channel gate. We demonstrate that cleavage of the γ-subunit, which is critical for full channel activation, does not mediate activation of ENaC by αW493R. Our molecular dynamics simulations led us to identify a channel-activating electrostatic interaction between α2Arg-493 and γGlu-348 at the α2γ interface. By neutralizing a sodium-binding acidic patch at the α1β interface, we reduced ENaC activation of αW493R by more than 2-fold. By combining homology modeling, molecular dynamics, cysteine cross-linking, and voltage clamp experiments, we propose a dynamics-driven model for the gain-of-function in ENaC by αW493R. Our integrated computational and experimental approach advances our understanding of structure, dynamics, and function of ENaC in its disease-causing state."
https://openalex.org/W2199599899,"In the past 10 years, sequestration of Cry toxins and transfer to offspring has been indicated in three insect species in laboratory studies. This work directly demonstrates the sequestration and intergenerational transfer of Cry1F by the parents of the aphidophagous coccinellid predator, Harmonia axyridis, to its offspring. Recently emerged adults (10 individual couples/cage/treatment) were exposed during 20 days to aphids (100 Myzus persicae each day) that fed on a holidic diet containing 20 μg/mL Cry1F (and a control-group). Egg batches and neonate larvae were monitored daily, and counted and weighed for immunodetection of Cry1F by ELISA. At the end of the bioassay, the parents were weighed and analyzed by ELISA. Cry1F was detected in the offspring, both eggs and neonate larvae, of exposed H. axyridis adults. On average the neonate larvae had 60% of the Cry1F concentration of the eggs from the same egg batch. The Cry1F concentration in the adults was positively correlated with the concentration in their eggs. These three results provided independent evidence of transfer to offspring. No detrimental effects of Cry1F were observed on the age of first reproduction, total number of eggs laid per female, age-specific fecundity, egg development time, hatching rate, or fertility rate. The occurrence and generality of intergenerational transfer of Cry toxins should be investigated in the field to determine its potential ecological implications."
