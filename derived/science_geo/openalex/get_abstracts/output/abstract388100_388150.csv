https://openalex.org/W2034369462,"THE camphor reaction of yeast, described by Bauch1, was interpreted by me2 as a narcosis affecting the normal growth of the yeast cell. Instead of budding normally, the yeast, under the influence of many chemicals of the same type as the narcotics, grows out into associations of cells, which show an irregular, tube-like, bottle-shaped or vesicular form. Their cell volume is often enlarged. In 1938 and 1939, Segal3 induced this reaction by treatment with the higher aliphatic alcohols and fusel oil. The so-called involution forms of yeast, often observed in ageing cultures in connexion with the autolysis, seems to be a phenomenon of the same nature, the yeast cells narcotizing themselves with their own metabolic products."

https://openalex.org/W1994614788,"IN connexion with the interesting report1 by Dr. M. Dixon and Dr. D. M. Needham on “Biochemical Research on Chemical Warfare Agents”, we should like to mention that the first observations on the cholinesterase-inhibiting action of fluorophosphonates were made in 19412. At that time the dimethyl and diethyl fluorophosphonates only were known; these compounds are somewhat less toxic than the diisopropyl fluorophosphonate, but otherwise have similar effects. The long-lasting constriction of the pupil produced by dimethyl fluorophosphonate suggested a mode of action like that of eserine, and we found that, like eserine, it strongly inhibited the cholinesterase activity of human plasma. When the more toxic di-isopropyl fluorophosphonate was prepared, we found that it had a more potent inhibiting action on cholinesterase3."

https://openalex.org/W2057804391,"AN adequate supply of highly purified water is an essential requirement for the study of plant nutrition problems, particularly those relating to mineral deficiencies, when experiments are carried out on a large scale. Liebig, Vanselow and Chapman1 in California found that tap water purified by the synthetic resin ion-exchange principle was satisfactory for maintaining healthy growth in citrus and sweet lemon without any toxic effects. They did not, however, report any experiments using demineralized water in deficiency cultures, although they published analytical results indicating that considerable removal of certain of the major and trace elements was effected by the treatment. Schroeder, Davis and Schafer2 have recently published a note in which they conclude that demineralized tap water is unsuitable as a substitute for distilled water for boron-deficiency cultures. Using the latter, symptoms of this deficiency developed in canning beet in five weeks, whereas, in parallel cultures with the demineralized water, no symptoms were observed."
