https://openalex.org/W1621595817,"Phagocyte-mediated oxidant damage to vascular endothelium is likely involved in various vasculopathies including atherosclerosis and pulmonary leak syndromes such as adult respiratory distress syndrome. We have shown that heme, a hydrophobic iron chelate, is rapidly incorporated into endothelial cells where, after as little as 1 h, it markedly aggravates cytotoxicity engendered by polymorphonuclear leukocyte oxidants or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In contrast, however, if cultured endothelial cells are briefly pulsed with heme and then allowed to incubate for a prolonged period (16 h), the cells become highly resistant to oxidant-mediated injury and to the accumulation of endothelial lipid peroxidation products. This protection is associated with the induction within 4 h of mRNAs for both heme oxygenase and ferritin. After 16 h heme oxygenase and ferritin have increased approximately 50-fold and 10-fold, respectively. Differential induction of these proteins determined that ferritin is probably the ultimate cytoprotectant. Ferritin inhibits oxidant-mediated cytolysis in direct relation to its intracellular concentration. Apoferritin, when added to cultured endothelial cells, is taken up in a dose-responsive manner and appears as cytoplasmic granules by immunofluorescence; in a similar dose-responsive manner, added apoferritin protects endothelial cells from oxidant-mediated cytolysis. Conversely, a site-directed mutant of ferritin (heavy chain Glu62—-Lys; His65—-Gly) which lacks ferroxidase activity and is deficient in iron sequestering capacity, is completely ineffectual as a cytoprotectant. We conclude that endothelium and perhaps other cell types may be protected from oxidant damage through the iron sequestrant, ferritin."
https://openalex.org/W1987159249,"The crystal structure of calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca(2+)-CaM) bound to a peptide analog of the CaM-binding region of chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase has been determined and refined to a resolution of 2.4 angstroms (A). The structure is compact and has the shape of an ellipsoid (axial ratio approximately 2:1). The bound CaM forms a tunnel diagonal to its long axis that engulfs the helical peptide, with the hydrophobic regions of CaM melded into a single area that closely covers the hydrophobic side of the peptide. There is a remarkably high pseudo-twofold symmetry between the closely associated domains. The central helix of the native CaM is unwound and expanded into a bend between residues 73 and 77. About 185 contacts (less than 4 A) are formed between CaM and the peptide, with van der Waals contacts comprising approximately 80% of this total."

Yet that same sensitivity also makes them highly susceptible to control, provided that the developing chaos can be analyzed in real time and that analysis is then used to make small control interventions. This strategy has been used here to stabilize cardiac arrhythmias induced by the drug ouabain in rabbit ventricle. By administering electrical stimuli to the heart at irregular times determined by chaos theory, the arrhythmia was converted to periodic beating."

https://openalex.org/W1987313471,The functional heterogeneity of potassium channels in eukaryotic cells arises not only from the multiple potassium channel genes and splice variants but also from the combinatorial mixing of different potassium channel polypeptides to form heteromultimeric channels with distinct properties. One structural element that determines the compatibility of different potassium channel polypeptides in subunit assembly has now been localized to the hydrophilic amino-terminal domain. A Drosophila Shaker B (ShB) potassium channel truncated polypeptide that contains only the hydrophilic amino-terminal domain can form a homomultimer; the minimal requirement for the homophilic interaction has been localized to a fragment of 114 amino acids. Substitution of the amino-terminal domain of a distantly related mammalian potassium channel polypeptide (DRK1) with that of ShB permits the chimeric DRK1 polypeptide to coassemble with ShB.

https://openalex.org/W1568953429,"Previously we have shown that the COOH-terminal 100 residues (A4CT) of the amyloid protein precursor (APP), which carry the sequence of the amyloid beta A4 protein of Alzheimer's disease at N-terminal position, form highly insoluble aggregates if expressed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Dyrks, T., Weidemann, A., Multhaup, G., Salbaum, J.M., Lemaire, H.-G., Kang, J., Muller-Hill, B., Masters, C. L., and Beyreuther, K. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 949-957). Here we report that aggregation of this COOH-terminal APP fragment A4CT and also of beta A4 itself depends on additional factors. In contrast to the reticulocyte expression system, expression of A4CT and beta A4 in the wheat germ expression system resulted in only monomeric forms. We have identified the factors which are capable of transforming both soluble A4CT and beta A4 into insoluble and aggregating molecules. Monomeric A4CT or beta A4 expressed in the wheat germ lysate could be transformed into aggregating molecules by the addition of metal-catalyzed oxidation systems. The addition of radical scavengers such as ascorbic acid, trolox, and amino acids prevented the aggregation process induced by the radical initiators. Thus, the aggregation of amyloidogenic APP fragments if analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis requires amino acid oxidation and protein cross-linking induced by radical generation systems."

https://openalex.org/W1979513610,Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors before tetanic stimulation blocks long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This NMDA-mediated inhibition of LTP can be reversed by the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitors L-NG-monomethyl-arginine or hemoglobin and mimicked by sodium nitroprusside. These results indicate that the timing of NO release relative to high-frequency activation of CA1 synapses may be an important determinant of LTP generation and suggest that NO may play a positive or negative modulatory role in LTP depending on prior events at the tetanized synapse and the ambient concentration of excitatory amino acids.

https://openalex.org/W1490846487,"We labeled rat adipocyte cell surface glucose transporters with an impermeable, photoreactive glucose analogue, 1,3-bis-(3-deoxy-D-glucopyranose-3-yloxy)-2-propyl 4-benzoylbenzoate (B3GL) and its radioactive tracer [3H]B3GL. The labeling did not affect glucose transporter subcellular distribution in basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes. When basal or insulin-stimulated adipocytes were labeled with [3H]B3GL and incubated at 37 degrees C in steady state, labeled GLUT4 was rapidly reduced at the cell surface and stoichiometrically recovered in microsomes without any change in GLUT4 protein levels in either pool. The labeled GLUT4 equilibrium exchange was found to be a simple first order process describable by two first order rate constants, one for internalization (k(in)) and the other for externalization (kex). Insulin affected both rate constants, reducing k(in) by 2.8-fold and increasing kex by 3.3-fold. It is concluded that GLUT4 constantly and rapidly recycles in adipocytes between the cell surface and its storage pool, and insulin increases the cell surface GLUT4 level in rat adipocytes by modulating both the internalization and the externalization steps of constitutively recycling GLUT4."

https://openalex.org/W2073039693,"Accurate binocular depth perception requires information about both stereopsis (relative depth) and distance (absolute depth). It is unclear how these two types of information are integrated in the visual system. In alert, behaving monkeys the responsiveness of a large majority of neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1) was modulated by the viewing distance. This phenomenon affected particularly disparity-related activity and background activity and was not dependent on the pattern of retinal stimulation. Therefore, extraretinal factors, probably related to ocular vergence or accommodation, or both, can affect processing early in the visual pathway. Such modulations could be useful for (i) judging true distance and (ii) scaling retinal disparity to give information about three-dimensional shape."
https://openalex.org/W1494524189,"An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ often begins as a Ca2+ wave, and this wave is thought to result from sequential activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive Ca2+ stores across the cell. We tested that hypothesis in pancreatic acinar cells, and since Ca2+ waves may regulate acinar Cl- secretion, we examined whether such waves also are important for amylase secretion. Ca2+ wave speed and direction was determined in individual cells within rat pancreatic acini using confocal line scanning microscopy. Both acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin-8 induced rapid Ca2+ waves which usually travelled in an apical-to-basal direction. Both caffeine and ryanodine, at concentrations that inhibit Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), markedly slowed the speed of these waves. Amylase secretion was increased over 3-fold in response to ACh stimulation, and this increase was preserved in the presence of ryanodine. These results indicate that 1) stimulation of either muscarinic or cholecystokinin-8 receptors induces apical-to-basal Ca2+ waves in pancreatic acinar cells, 2) the speed of such waves is dependent upon mobilization of caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores, and 3) ACh-induced amylase secretion is not inhibited by ryanodine. These observations provide direct evidence that Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release is important for propagation of cytosolic Ca2+ waves in pancreatic acinar cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539843762,"A fundamental property of the secretory tetrameric extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is its affinity for heparin and analogues, in vivo, mediating attachment to heparan sulfate proteoglycans located on cell surfaces and in the connective tissue matrix. EC-SOD is in vivo heterogeneous with regard to heparin affinity and can be divided into subclasses; A which lacks heparin affinity, B with intermediate affinity, and C with strong heparin affinity. The EC-SOD C subunits contain 222 amino acids and among the last 20 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, 10 are positively charged and six of these are located in a cluster in positions 210-215. To analyze if this local accumulation of basic amino acids is responsible for heparin binding we produced three series of recombinant EC-SOD (rEC-SOD) variants, six containing amino acid exchanges in the carboxyl-terminal end, four with truncations, and two with both truncations and substitutions. Exchange of positively or negatively charged amino acids on the carboxyl-terminal side of the cluster results in only minor modifications in heparin affinity, whereas substitution of three of the amino acids in the cluster abrogates the heparin binding. Insertions of stop codons at different positions resulted in either C or A but not B class EC-SOD. In an attempt to produce EC-SODs with intermediate heparin affinities, plasmids defining C and A class EC-SOD were cotransfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition to the parental A and C class EC-SOD forms, two variants with intermediate heparin affinities were formed. Coincubation of EC-SOD C and A resulted in the appearance of one heterotetramer with intermediate affinity for heparin. We conclude that the cluster of six basic amino acids forms the essential part of the heparin-binding domain and that the composition of the four subunits in the EC-SOD tetramer determines the affinity for heparin. This domain is different from heparin-binding domains of other proteins, and its localization allows the distribution of EC-SOD in vivo to be regulated by proteolytic processing."

https://openalex.org/W1498789021,"In order to define the differences in the distribution of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in pancreatic beta-cells stimulated with the fuel secretagogue glucose or the Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents carbachol and ATP, we applied digital video imaging to beta-cells loaded with fura-2.83% of the cells responded to glucose with an increase in [Ca2+]i after a latency of 117 +/- 24 s (mean +/- S.E., 85 cells). Of these cells, 16% showed slow wave oscillations (frequency 0.35/min). In order to assess the relationship between membrane potential and the distribution of the [Ca2+]i rise, digital image analysis and perforated patch-clamp methods were applied simultaneously. The system used allowed sufficient temporal resolution to visualize a subplasmalemmal Ca2+ transient due to a single glucose-induced action potential. Glucose could also elicit a slow depolarization which did not cause Ca2+ influx until the appearance of the first of a train of action potentials. [Ca2+]i rose progressively during spike firing. Inhibition of Ca2+ influx by EGTA abolished the glucose-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. In contrast, the peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]i response to carbachol was not significantly different in normal or in Ca(2+)-deprived medium. Occasionally, the increase of the [Ca2+]i rise was polarized to one area of the cell different from the subplasmalemmal rise caused by glucose. The amplitude of the response and the number of responding cells were significantly increased when carbachol was applied after the addition of high glucose (11.2 mM). ATP also raised [Ca2+]i and promoted both Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ influx. The intracellular distribution of [Ca2+]i was homogeneous during the onset of the response. A polarity in the [Ca2+]i distribution could be detected either in the descending phase of the peak or in subsequent peaks during [Ca2+]i oscillations caused by ATP. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the sequential application of ATP and carbachol revealed that carbachol was still able to raise [Ca2+]i after exhaustion of the ATP response. This may be due to desensitization to the former agonist, since the response occurred in the same area of the cell. These results reveal subtle differences in [Ca2+]i distribution following membrane depolarization with glucose or the application of Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1530747537,"The cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) contains multiple basic amino acid motifs, suggesting that PTHrP undergoes extensive post-translational processing prior to secretion. The secretory forms of the peptide are currently unknown. To identify these secretory forms, medium was harvested from three cell types: human renal carcinoma (SKRC-1) cells, human keratinocytes, and rat insulinoma cells stably transfected with the cDNA for PTHrP(1-141) (RIN-141 cells). Amino-terminal species were immunopurified using an anti-PTHrP(1-36) column, and mid-region species using an anti-PTHrP(37-74) column. PTHrP peptides in medium and in cell extracts were further resolved by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and identified using region-specific immunoassays. SKRC-1 and RIN-141 cells secreted three distinct amino-terminal species and a novel, non-amino-terminal, mid-region fragment. Sequence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that the RIN-141 cell mid-region fragment begins at amino acid 38 of the cDNA-predicted sequence and is approximately 70 amino acids in length. Comparison of RP-HPLC elution patterns suggests that SKRC-1 cells and keratinocytes secrete a similar or identical mid-region fragment. Immunofluorescence studies revealed a Golgi pattern for the amino-terminal species and a secretory granule pattern for the mid-region fragment. These studies indicate that 1) multiple PTHrP species are secreted, including a novel mid-region fragment; 2) Arg37 serves as a cleavage site in at least three cell types; 3) PTHrP(1-36) is likely to be an authentic secretory form of PTHrP; and 4) the mid-region fragment appears to be packaged into secretory granules. The marked interspecies conservation of this mid-region PTHrP suggests that it will have important biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1566203300,"Recently, we have shown that the capsular polysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 is composed of an aggregate of two discrete large molecular weight polysaccharides (designated polysaccharides A and B). Following disaggregation of this capsular complex by very mild acid treatment, high resolution NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that polysaccharides A and B consist of highly charged repeating unit structures with unusual substituent groups (Baumann, H., Tzianabos, A. O., Brisson, J.-R., Kasper, D.L., and Jennings, H.J. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 4081-4089). Presently, we report that the capsular polysaccharide of B. fragilis represents a complex structure that is formed as a result of ionic interactions between polysaccharides A and B. Electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled organisms (with monoclonal antibodies specific for polysaccharides A and B) demonstrated that the two polysaccharides are co-expressed on the cell surface of B. fragilis. We have shown that the purified capsule complex is made up exclusively of polysaccharide A and polysaccharide B (no other macromolecular structure was detected) in a 1:3.3 ratio and that disaggregation of this complex into the native forms of the constituent polysaccharides could be accomplished by preparative isoelectric focusing. Structural analyses of the native polysaccharides A and B showed that they possessed the same repeating unit structures as the respective acid-derived polysaccharides. The ionic nature of the linkage between polysaccharides A and B was demonstrated by reassociation of the native polysaccharides to form an aggregated polymer comparable to the original complex. The distinctive composition of this macromolecule may provide a rationale for the unusual biologic properties associated with the B. fragilis capsular polysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1503356929,"We have reported that proteasomes are expressed at abnormally high levels in various hematopoietic tumor cells (Kumatori, A., Tanaka, K., Inamura, N., Sone, S., Ogura, T., Matsumoto, T., Tachikawa, T., Shin, S., and Ichihara, A. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 7071-7075). In the present study, we examined changes in the expressions of proteasomes during growth of peripheral T-lymphocytes from healthy adults and differentiation of human leukemic cell lines. Up-regulation of mRNAs encoding multiple proteasome subunits was observed during proliferation of resting T-cells induced by mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2. In contrast, in vitro terminal differentiation into monocytic, granulocytic, and erythroid cells of various immature leukemic cell lines, such as HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and K562 erythroleukemia cells, by various inducing agents caused rapid and marked down-regulation of proteasomes expression, independently of the cell type, direction of differentiation, or type of signal. The syntheses of proteasome subunits of 21-31 kDa and their associated components of 35-110 kDa, measured by [35S]methionine incorporation, were much higher in mitogen-activated T-cells and unstimulated HL-60 cells, which grow rapidly, than in resting and differentiated cells, indicating apparent correlations of the mRNA levels of proteasomes with their translational activities. However, immunochemically, no detectable difference in the cellular contents of proteasomes was found in these cells in induced and uninduced states for proliferation and differentiation, suggesting accelerated turnover of proteasomes in rapidly proliferating cells. Inhibition of proteasome expression by an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for the largest proteasome subunit, C2, caused partial arrest of cell cycle progression of T-lymphocytes, suggesting that up-regulation of proteasomes is indispensable for proliferation of the cells. We also observed that the nuclear fraction of proteasomes increased in proliferating T-cells and that proteasomes moved rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm during differentiation of HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577100808,"The tetracycline resistance gene of pBR322 encodes a 41-kDa inner membrane protein (TetA) that acts as a tetracycline/H+ antiporter. Based on hydrophobicity profiles, we identified 12 potential transmembrane segments in TetA. We used oligonucleotide deletion mutagenesis to fuse alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) to the C-terminal edge of each of the predicted periplasmic and cytoplasmic segments of TetA. In general, the PhoA activities of the TetA-PhoA fusions support a TetA topology model consisting of 12 transmembrane segments with the N and C termini in the cytoplasm. However, several TetA-PhoA fusions have unexpected properties. One PhoA fusion to a predicted cytoplasmic segment (C6) has high activity. However, previous protease accessibility studies on the related Tn10 TetA protein indicated that C6 is cytoplasmically localized as predicted (Eckert, B., and Beck, C. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11663-11670). PhoA fusions to three predicted periplasmic segments (P1, P2, and P5) have low to intermediate activity. In each case, the preceding transmembrane segment (TM1, TM3, and TM9) contains an aspartate (Asp17, Asp86, and Asp287). We show that these aspartates act like signal sequence mutations for PhoA export: (i) Asp—-Ala mutations increase the PhoA activity of fusions to P1, P2, and P5. (ii) The signal sequence mutation suppressor prlA402 increases the PhoA activity of these same fusions. We also show that the aspartates in TM1, TM3, and TM9 are critical for wild-type TetA function; they are conserved in related TetA proteins and Asp—-Ala mutations reduce or eliminate tetracycline resistance. The properties of the anomalous TetA-PhoA fusions suggest that TetA sequences C-terminal to some cytoplasmic and periplasmic segments are required for the proper localization of those segments, i.e. long range interactions may be more important in determining the membrane topology of TetA than suggested in some general models."
https://openalex.org/W1591739041,"IgM is secreted in two functional polymeric forms. Secreted IgM was originally thought to be exclusively a pentameric molecule containing J (joining) chain, but many B cells also secrete hexameric IgM lacking J chain. Hexameric IgM may play an important role in the immune system, since it is up to 20 times more active than pentameric IgM in initiating the complement cascade. The predominant polymeric form of IgM secreted by B cell lines, either pentameric or hexameric, correlates with the concentration of J chain present during polymerization, and cells that express high levels of J chain secrete mostly IgM pentamers. The B cell lymphoma WEHI-231 does not express J chain, and the majority of its secreted IgM is polymerized as hexamers. When a J chain-encoding cDNA was expressed in these cells, the secreted IgM was found to be almost exclusively pentameric. However, although the expression of J chain dramatically altered the phenotype of the IgM secreted by these cells, it had little effect on their secretory rate. We conclude that J chain regulates the structure and function of the IgM polymers secreted by B cells, but it is not necessary for either IgM polymerization or secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2103912457,"We have used transient transfection assays with reporter plasmids expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, linked to regions of mouse c-fos, to identify a specific estrogen response element (ERE) in this protooncogene. This element is located in the untranslated 3'-flanking region of the c-fos gene, 5 kilobases (kb) downstream from the c-fos promoter and 1.5 kb downstream of the poly(A) signal. This element confers estrogen responsiveness to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporters linked to both the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and the homologous c-fos promoter. Deletion analysis localized the response element to a 200-base pair fragment which contains the element GGTCACCACAGCC that resembles the consensus ERE sequence GGTCACAGTGACC originally identified in Xenopus vitellogenin A2 gene. A synthetic 36-base pair oligodeoxynucleotide containing this c-fos sequence conferred estrogen inducibility to the thymidine kinase promoter. The corresponding sequence also induced reporter activity when present in the c-fos gene fragment 3 kb from the thymidine kinase promoter. Gel-shift experiments demonstrated that synthetic oligonucleotides containing either the consensus ERE or the c-fos element bind human estrogen receptor obtained from a yeast expression system. However, the mobility of the shifted band is faster for the fos-ERE-complex than the consensus ERE complex suggesting that the three-dimensional structure of the protein-DNA complexes is different or that other factors are differentially involved in the two reactions. When the 5'-GGTCA sequence present in the c-fos ERE is mutated to 5'-TTTCA, transcriptional activation and receptor binding activities are both lost. Mutation of the CAGCC-3' element corresponding to the second half-site of the c-fos sequence also led to the loss of receptor binding activity, suggesting that both half-sites of this element are involved in this function. The estrogen induction mediated by either the c-fos or the consensus ERE was blunted by the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Based on these studies, we believe the 3'-fos ERE sequence we have identified may be a major cis-acting element involved in the physiological regulation of the gene by estrogens in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2014865384,G proteins couple receptors to their target enzymes in many signal transduction cascades. It has generally been thought that deactivation of such cascades cannot occur without the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by G protein. This requirement has now been reexamined in both vertebrate and invertebrate phototransduction. Results indicate that GTP hydrolysis is not required for deactivation. Evidence is presented for an alternative model in which the target enzyme is deactivated by an inhibitory factor that is available even when GTP hydrolysis is blocked.

https://openalex.org/W1556946959,"The mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ antiporter plays a key role in the physiological regulation of intramitochondrial Ca2+, which in turn attunes mitochondrial enzymes to the changing demands of the cell for ATP. We have now purified the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter from beef heart mitochondria by assaying detergent-solubilized chromatography fractions for reconstitutive activity. Na+ and Ca2+ transport were assayed using the fluorescent probes, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate and Fura-2, respectively. This approach enabled us to identify Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity with a 110-kDa inner membrane protein that catalyzed Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ transport and Ca(2+)-dependent Na+ transport. A new finding was that the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter also catalyzed Na+/Li+ exchange in the absence of Ca2+. All modes of transport were electroneutral and were inhibited by diltiazem and tetraphenylphosphonium cation. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the 110-kDa protein inhibited Na+/Ca2+ and Na+/Li+ exchange in the reconstituted system and recognized 110-kDa proteins in mitochondrial membranes isolated from rat heart, liver, and kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1535097987,"Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase was highly expressed in the human U937 monoblast leukemia cell line when differentiated into monocyte/macrophage-like cells by growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. The specific activity of LTC4 synthase in differentiated cells (399.0 +/- 84.1 pmol of LTC4 formed.min-1.mg-1) was markedly higher (10-fold; p less than 0.001) than in undifferentiated U937 cells (39.9 +/- 16.7 pmol of LTC4 formed.min-1.mg-1) or freshly isolated blood monocytes (21.5 +/- 4.8 pmol of LTC4 formed.min-1.mg-1). The increase in LTC4 synthase activity following dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation was substantially higher than the increase observed for other proteins involved in leukotriene biosynthesis. LTC4 synthase activity was unaffected in U937 cells differentiated by growth in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The HL-60 myeloblast leukemia cell line expressed higher LTC4 synthase levels when differentiated into either neutrophil-like or macrophage-like cells by growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (respectively), but reached a specific activity comparable only to undifferentiated U937 cells. Human LTC4 synthase was found to be a unique membrane-bound enzymatic activity completely distinct from alpha, mu, pi, theta, and microsomal glutathione S-transferases, as determined by differential detergent solubilization, chromatographic separation, substrate specificity, and Western blot analysis. An 18-kDa polypeptide was specifically labeled in membranes from dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated U937 cells using azido 125I-LTC4, a photoaffinity probe based on the product of the LTC4 synthase-catalyzed reaction. Photolabeling of the 18-kDa polypeptide was specifically competed for by LTC4 (greater than 50% at 0.1 microM) but not by 100,000-fold higher concentrations of reduced glutathione (10 mM). Elevation of both the level of the specifically photolabeled 18-kDa polypeptide and of LTC4 synthase specific activity occurred concomitantly with dimethyl sulfoxide differentiation of U937 cells. We conclude that differentiation of U937 cells into monocyte/macrophage-like cells by growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide results in high levels of expression of LTC4 synthase activity. Human LTC4 synthase is a unique enzyme with a high degree of specificity for LTA4 and may therefore be dedicated exclusively to the formation of LTC4 in vivo. An 18-kDa membrane polypeptide, specifically labeled by a photoaffinity derivative of LTC4, is a candidate for being either LTC4 synthase or a subunit thereof."
https://openalex.org/W1606562123,"Parkinson's disease has been modeled in humans, lower primates, and to a lesser extent in some other vertebrates by administration of the potent neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine). The MPTP model has thus drawn considerable attention as a system to search for anti-Parkinson's disease drugs, although the cost and scarcity of primates has limited extensive applications. We now report that a parkinsonian syndrome can be elicited in the common goldfish (Carassius auratus) by a single dose of MPTP. The syndrome is characterized by profound bradykinesia (slow movement), the full extent of which is reached 3 days after MPTP administration. The reduction in movement is paralleled by loss of dopamine and norepinephrine from the forebrain and midbrain and in other brain regions as well. The toxic oxidative product of MPTP, MPP+, is also accumulated predominantly in forebrain and midbrain, and pretreatment with the monoamine oxidase blocker tranylcypromine substantially reduces accumulation of the toxic metabolite. A barely perceptible coarseness in balance adjustment also occurs in treated animals. The MPTP-treated goldfish recover normal movement and normal brain monoamine levels within 10-13 days after administration of the drug. We interpret these and other data to indicate that MPTP can induce a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in the goldfish that is similar in many aspects to the syndrome induced by MPTP in humans and other primates. This remarkable parallel may permit the goldfish to supplement expensive and scarce primates for the purpose of searching and screening neuroprotective drugs with specific relevance to Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1501901943,"The Xenopus cdk2 gene encodes a 32-kDa protein kinase with sequence similarity to the 34-kDa product of the cdc2 gene. Previous studies have shown that the kinase activity of the protein product of the cdk2 gene oscillates in the Xenopus embryonic cell cycle with a high in M-phase and a low in interphase. In the present study cdk2 was found not to be associated with any newly synthesized proteins during the cell cycle, but the enzyme did undergo periodic changes in phosphorylation. Upon exit from metaphase, cdk2 became increasingly phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine residues, and labeling on these residues increased progressively until entry into mitosis, when tyrosine residues were markedly dephosphorylated. Phosphopeptide mapping of cdk2 demonstrated the major sites of phosphorylation were in a phosphopeptide with a pI of 3.7 that contained both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine. This phosphopeptide accumulated in egg extracts blocked in S-phase with aphidicolin and was not evident in cdc2 immunoprecipitated under the same conditions. Under the same conditions cdc2 was phosphorylated primarily on a phosphopeptide containing both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues, most likely threonine 14 and tyrosine 15. Affinity-purified human GST-cdc25 was able to dephosphorylate and activate cdk2 isolated from interphase cells. Phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that the phosphate was specifically removed from the same phosphopeptide identified as the major in vivo site of phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that cdk2 is regulated in the cell cycle by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on both serine and tyrosine residues. Moreover, the increased phosphorylation of cdk2 in aphidicolin-blocked extracts and the ability of cdc25 to mediate cdk2 dephosphorylation in vitro suggest the possibility that cdk2 is part of the mechanism ensuring mitosis is not initiated until completion of DNA replication. It also implies cdc25 may have other functions in addition to the regulation of cdc2 kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1591108618,"Estrogen receptor (ER) binding has been shown to decrease in breast cancer cell lines exposed to sodium butyrate; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, butyrate caused a rapid time- and concentration-dependent decrease in ER mRNA levels, apparent by 3 h at 3 mM butyrate. ER gene transcription rate was decreased and cycloheximide co-treatment did not relieve this inhibitory effect, suggesting that the butyrate effect was not dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. In both MCF-7 and T-47D cells the decrease in ER mRNA was mirrored by an increase in the level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) mRNA. A marked inverse relationship exists between ER and EGF-R in human breast cancer biopsies and cell lines, and the reciprocal modulation of these genes by butyrate suggests that the expression of ER and EGF-R may be co-regulated. This relationship was further investigated in lines expressing only one or the other receptor. In the ER-positive EGF-R-negative line, MDA-MB-134-VI, butyrate exposure decreased ER mRNA levels, implying that the regulation of ER mRNA by butyrate is independent of EGF-R expression. However, butyrate decreased EGF-R mRNA in two ER-negative lines, MDA-MB-231 and HBL-100. As this effect differed from that in ER-positive lines, the regulation of EGF-R may depend on the expression of ER. The possibility that ER and EGF-R gene expression are closely linked has implications in the understanding of progression of human breast cancers to a hormone-independent phenotype and for the use of ER and EGF-R levels as independent prognostic indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2062608951,"Oncogenic viruses demonstrating a strict tropism for the mammary gland provide special opportunities to study the susceptibility of this tissue to neoplasia. In rats, human adenovirus type 9 (Ad9) elicits mammary fibroadenomas that are similar to common breast tumors in women, as well as phyllodes-like tumors and mammary sarcomas. By constructing recombinant adenoviruses between Ad9 and Ad26 (a related nontumorigenic virus), it was shown that the Ad9 E4 region was absolutely required to produce these mammary tumors. This indicates that an adenovirus gene located outside the classic transforming region (E1) can significantly influence the in vivo oncogenicity of an adenovirus. Consistent with a direct role in mammary gland oncogenesis, the Ad9 E4 region also exhibited transforming properties in vitro. Therefore, the Ad9 E4 region is a viral oncogene specifically involved in mammary gland tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1922692405,"The genes for semenogelin I and II, the major protein constituents of the human seminal fluid, have been characterized by three overlapping clones in bacteriophage lambda, encompassing 31.5 kilobases (kb) of genomic DNA. The two genes are located 11.5 kb apart in the region q12-q13.1 on chromosome 20. Both genes are relatively compact, spanning only 2.7 and 3.1 kb, respectively. The transcription units are composed of three exons, of which the first encodes the signal peptide, the second encodes the secreted protein, while the third solely contains 3'-noncoding nucleotides. The nucleotide sequences exhibit a similarity of close to 90% in the exons and exceeding 80% in the introns and flanking nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1644872108,"Soluble angiotensin-binding protein (sABP) is a 75-kDa cytosolic protein that binds angiotensins and its analogues with high affinity. In this study, the primary structure of porcine sABP is determined by cDNA cloning. Based on the partial amino acid sequences of sABP tryptic fragments, fully degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized, and used as primers for polymerase chain reactions to amplify the corresponding sABP cDNA fragment from porcine liver first-strand cDNA. By using initially the polymerase chain reaction product and later partial cDNA clones as probes, porcine heart and liver cDNA libraries were screened, and several positive clones were obtained including one covering the entire coding region. From the cDNA sequence, an open reading frame that encodes sABP as a 704-amino acid protein with molecular mass of 80,800 daltons is predicted. No significant homology was seen between sABP and other proteins in GenBank and NBRF data bases, including the angiotensin-related proteins such as angiotensin converting enzyme, renin, and AT1 angiotensin II receptor. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA revealed that the mRNA for sABP is expressed as 5.3- and 2.8-3.2-kilobase transcripts. These transcripts are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Within the 3'-untranslated region of the cDNA sequence downstream from the polyadenylation signals for smaller transcripts, a porcine short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) was found; only the longer 5.3-kilobase transcript had the SINE sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1605861738,"We have examined, using self-cleaving ribozymes, the intracellular trans-activation kinetics of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) by viral protein Tat. Experiments were designed to effect a competition (during RNA chain elongation) between cleavage of a nascent RNA containing the Tat-responsive target sequence (TAR) and Tat interaction with the same TAR in the process of LTR-trans-activation. We found that fast self-cleavage of nascent TAR-containing RNA abolished Tat trans-activation. Slowing the cleavage reaction kinetically rescued trans-activation. Based on our results, we conclude that the rate-limiting step in HIV-1 LTR trans-activation is the initial contact made between Tat/TAR/LTR rather than the promoter proximal pausing of RNA polymerases that are tethered to functional TAR."
https://openalex.org/W1779449612,"The objectives of this study were to investigate whether oral supplementation of l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTC) is effective for increasing tissue glutathione (GSH) concentrations in rats fed a diet very low (0.5%) in protein — a model of wasting malnutrition — and to determine the efficacy of OTC for protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity. Weanling rats, fed a 0.5 or 15% protein diet for 2 wk, were given an oral supplement of OTC, and tissue GSH concentrations were measured over a 24 h period. OTC supplementation to rats fed 0.5% protein significantly increased GSH concentrations in liver and lung, but not in kidney and blood, when compared with the 0.5% protein unsupplemented group. The liver GSH concentration in the 0.5% protein OTC-supplemented group was higher than the 15% control group. Daily supplementation of OTC protected rats from pulmonary oxygen toxicity during 4 days of 85% oxygen exposure as determined by lung-to-body weight ratios and in vivo proton magnetic resonance imaging. Although hyperoxia exposure increased lung GSH concentrations in all groups, OTC supplementation was effective for increasing lung GSH concentration in rats fed the 0.5% protein diet. This study demonstrated that oral administration of OTC to wasting malnourished rats is an effective procedure to increase GSH concentration rapidly in target organs such as lung, and that daily supplementation of a low dose of OTC has a sustained effect to protect against pulmonary oxygen toxicity during 4 days of hyperoxia exposure.— Taylor, C. G.; Bauman, P. F., Sikorski, B., Bray, T. M.

https://openalex.org/W1510421679,"The human ETS1 proto-oncogene proteins have been isolated from the T-cell leukemia line, CEM, by immunoaffinity chromatography and their identity confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. Incubation of CEM cells with N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) indicates that ETS proteins can be modified in their cellular context and that pretreatment of the cells with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) protects ETS1 proteins from TLCK modification. These data show that ETS1 proteins can exist in at least two different states, -SH-available and -SH-protected. Renatured human ETS1 has DNA sequence-specific binding to the PEA3 (CAGGAAGT) motif. The ETS1.PEA3 complex can be observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Purified ETS1 retards a band which is exactly the same size as a complex that is retarded from nuclear extracts prepared from CEM cells. Reduced ETS1 is required to form the ETS1.PEA3 complex, however; modification of the ETS1 -SH groups by either NEM or by TLCk does not inhibit formation of the complex. The ETS1.PEA3 complex formed with TLCK-modified ETS1 has a slower mobility than the complex formed with unmodified ETS1. Zone sedimentation analysis of purified ETS1 indicates that it is the monomer of ETS1 which binds to the PEA3 oligonucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1549504915,"Besides heme deficiency, protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates becomes inhibited upon exposure to a variety of agents that mimic conditions which induce the heat shock response in cells. This inhibition has been demonstrated to be due primarily to the activation of the heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase (HRI) which causes an arrest in the initiation of translation. In this report, the sensitivity of protein synthesis in hemin-supplemented lysates to inhibition by Hg2+, GSSG, methylene blue, and heat shock was examined in six different reticulocyte lysate preparations. The extent to which translation was inhibited in response to Hg2+, GSSG, methylene blue, and heat shock correlated inversely with the relative levels of the 70-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp 70) and a 56-kDa protein (p56) present in the lysates determined by Western blotting. The ability of hemin to restore protein synthesis upon addition to heme-deficient lysates was also examined. While the restoration of protein synthesis correlated roughly with the levels of hsp 90 present, the results also suggest that the heme regulation of HRI probably involves the interaction of HRI with several factors present in the lysate besides hsp 90. A comparison of two lysate preparations, which had a 2-fold difference in their protein synthesis rates, indicated that the slower translational rate of the one lysate could be accounted for by its low level of constitutive eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation, with its accompanying decrease in the eIF-2B activity and lower level of polyribosome loading. The present study supports the notion that the previously demonstrated interaction of HRI with hsp 90, hsp 70, and p56 in reticulocyte lysates may play a direct role in regulating HRI activation or activity. We hypothesize that the competition of denatured protein and HRI for the binding of hsp 70 may be a molecular signal that triggers the activation of HRI in reticulocyte lysates in response to stress. Possible functions for p56 in the regulation of HRI activity are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1512420954,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are highly conserved approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that were first identified based on their ability to stimulate the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha and thus activate adenylyl cyclase. Proteins with ARF activity have been characterized from different mammalian tissues and exhibited different requirements for activity, stability, and phospholipid. Based on molecular cloning and mRNA distribution, at least six mammalian ARFs, which fall into three classes, have been identified. To test whether individual ARFs might have different requirements for optimal activity, as judged by their ability to enhance cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, four ARFs from classes I, II, and III were produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and characterized. Recombinant bovine ARF 2 (rARF 2) and human ARF 3 (rARF 3) (class I), human ARF 5 (rARF 5, class II), and human ARF 6 (rARF 6, class III) differed in the effects of phospholipid and detergent on their ability to enhance cholera toxin activity; rARFs 2, 3, and 5 required dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and cholate, whereas rARF 6 did not require phospholipid/detergent for activity. Further characterization of two of the more divergent ARFs (ARFs 2 and 6) showed that both exhibited guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding which was enhanced by DMPC/cholate. In the transferase assay, rARF 2 required approximately 4 microM GTP for half-maximal stimulation of toxin activity, whereas rARF 6 required 0.05 microM GTP. rARF 6 exhibited a delay in activation of toxin not detected with rARF 2 that may be related to a requirement for guanine nucleotide exchange and/or GTP binding. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that the highly conserved members of the ARF family have different requirements for optimal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1562218601,"Conventional methods of endothelial cell culture on monolayers and beads require enzymatic digestion, traumatic scraping, or centrifugation to transfer cells to other experimental systems. Gelfoam, a porous gelatin block, not only supports the growth of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells but also allows the rapid transfer of cell-laden blocks from one experimental system to another with minimal intervention. This property has been shown to be especially useful for the rapid fixation of endothelial cells for microscopy using standard histologic methods. Histology confirmed that the trabecular nature of the substrate allows endothelial cells to line the interstices of the sponge matrix and grow in a configuration that simulates the appearance of the endothelium in small vessels and capillaries. The inoculation of 1 x 10(5) endothelial cells on 7.5 mg Gelfoam (24 x 8 x 2 mm blocks) was enhanced by fibroblast growth factor and resulted in cell attachment by day 2 with a cell doubling time of 1.7 days. In addition, endothelial cells completely infiltrated 1, 5 and 7.5 mg Gelfoam blocks, as verified by histology. Assays to quantify cell number and protein were easily performed. To facilitate cell counting, the Gelfoam matrix was rapidly removed by the addition of 0.05 mg/ml collagenase, a concentration that interfered minimally with the assay for cellular protein concentration. The data demonstrate that Gelfoam is a suitable support growth matrix for the in vitro culture of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1618547117,"Evidence is presented that demonstrated that the 45- and 104-kDa forms of phosphatidate phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Morlock, K. R., McLaughlin, J. J., Lin, Y.-P., and Carman, G. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3586-3593) were regulated differentially by phosphorylation. Purified 45-kDa phosphatidate phosphatase was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase whereas purified 104-kDa phosphatidate phosphatase was not phosphorylated. cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of pure 45-kDa phosphatidate phosphatase at a serine residue which resulted in a stimulation (2.4-fold) of phosphatidate phosphatase activity. Alkaline phosphatase catalyzed the dephosphorylation of pure 45-kDa phosphatidate phosphatase which resulted in an inhibition (1.3-fold) of phosphatidate phosphatase activity. Results of studies using mutants (bcy1 and cyr1) defective in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity corroborated the results of the phosphorylation studies using pure preparations of phosphatidate phosphatase. The 45-kDa phosphatidate phosphatase phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo had phosphopeptides in common. The activation of the GAL10-RAS2val19 allele in mutant cells resulted in an increase in the synthesis of diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols. These results were consistent with the phosphorylation and activation of 45-kDa phosphatidate phosphatase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1579629597,"The Na-Ca exchange inhibitory peptide (XIP), which corresponds to residues 251-270 of the Na-Ca exchange protein, specifically inhibits exchange activity (Li, Z., Nicoll, D. A, Collins, A., Hilgemann, D. W., Filoteo, A. G., Penniston, J. T., Weiss, J. N., Tomich, J. M., and Philipson, K. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1014-1020). We have found that XIP decreased Na+i-dependent Ca2+ uptake to 46 and 20% of control in mixed and inside-out bovine sarcolemmal (SL) vesicles, respectively, and to 22% of control in ferret red cell vesicles. XIP inhibited uptake in bovine SL vesicles after proteolytic digestion. XIP also inhibited Na+o-dependent Ca2+ efflux in bovine SL vesicles but did not inhibit Ca2+ uptake in reconstituted proteoliposomes. Extracellular XIP did not inhibit Ca2+ uptake into intact ferret red cells. Inhibition of uptake in bovine SL vesicles was reduced as the ionic strength was increased. 125I-labeled XIP (1 microM) was cross-linked to proteins of bovine SL vesicles, ferret red cell vesicles, and intact ferret red cells. Labeling of bands at approximately 75, 120, and 220 kDa (in bovine SL vesicles) and bands at 55 and 85 kDa (in ferret red cell vesicles) was detected. No cross-linking was detected in intact ferret red cells. We conclude that XIP inhibition is insensitive to proteolytic digestion and is partially dependent on charge association and conformation of the exchanger. XIP binds to and interacts with the intracellular side of the Na-Ca exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1559749427,"The general transcription factor TFIIIC is necessary for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase III. TFIIIC binds predominantly to the B-Block promoter element, which is present in tRNA genes, several viral RNA genes and repetitive DNA elements, and to the TFIIIA.DNA complex on 5 S RNA genes. Here we report a characterization of Xenopus laevis TFIIIC and its interaction with the TFIIIA.5 S RNA gene complex. A polypeptide with apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa was specifically cross-linked to a B-Block oligonucleotide by UV light. This polypeptide was present in the partially purified TFIIIC fraction and in a complex with a B-Block double-stranded oligonucleotide isolated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. TFIIIC.TFIIIA.DNA gel mobility shift complexes were obtained using B-Block DNA affinity-purified TFIIIC and buffer conditions employing low Mg2+ (1 mM) and high dithiothreitol (7 mM) concentrations. Three TFIIIC.TFIIIA.5 S RNA gene complexes were observed by gel mobility shift analysis. One of these complexes was resistant to dissociation by the addition of competing DNA, but the formation of all three complexes was prevented by the inclusion of excess specific competitor DNA in the initial binding reactions. The apparent affinity of TFIIIC for the TFIIIA.5 S DNA complex was 5-fold higher for the somatic-type 5 S RNA gene than for the oocyte-type 5 S RNA gene. Mutations near the 5' boundary of the TFIIIA binding site alter the DNase I footprint of the TFIIIA.DNA complex and reduce the affinity of TFIIIA-mutant 5 S gene complexes for TFIIIC. Differences in TFIIIC affinity for the two classes of 5 S RNA genes may play a role in the developmental regulation of these gene families."
https://openalex.org/W1813353304,"The nucleic acid binding domain of the adenovirus type 2 (or type 5) DNA-binding protein (DBP) was characterized by using limited proteolysis and photochemical cross-linking. Three proteases were used to generate fragments of DBP which retained the ability to bind to single-stranded DNA. One fragment, a 35-kDa tryptic product, was partially sequenced and found to contain amino acid residues 153 to approximately 470. This fragment further defines the minimum region of the protein which is required for nucleic acid binding. The DNA binding pocket of DBP was defined by using ultraviolet irradiation to cross-link covalently the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein to the oligonucleotide p(dT)14. Cross-linked complexes were digested with trypsin, and peptides which were associated with the oligonucleotide were isolated by anion-exchange and reverse-phase ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography. Two DBP peptides comprised of residues 294-308 and 415-434 were isolated by this approach. Sequence analysis indicated that methionine 299 and phenylalanine 418 were probable sites of cross-linking between their respective peptides and the oligonucleotide; hence these residues may represent contact points between DBP and single-stranded DNA. Both residues are highly conserved and are near, but not identical to, regions of the protein implicated previously in DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1545540616,"We have previously reported that steroidogenesis is dramatically reduced in mouse Y1 adrenocortical cells which express the human apolipoprotein E gene (Y1-E cells). This suppression results in part from inhibition of cAMP-mediated events. In this report we have examined the expression of protein kinase C (PKC) in the Y1-E cell lines. Total cellular PKC activity in vitro is increased 3-5-fold in the Y1-E cell lines. PKC activity in the particulate and cytosolic fractions is increased to the same relative extent. Increased PKC activity reflects increased levels of PKC mRNA, as determined by Northern blot analysis, and PKC protein, as determined by immunoblot analysis. Increased expression of PKC in the Y1-E cell lines is accompanied by a 2-3-fold increase in diacylglycerol, an in vivo activator of PKC. To determine the contribution of elevated PKC expression to the Y1-E cell phenotype, we utilized the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and calphostin C. Upon treatment with staurosporine or calphostin C, expression of P450-cholesterol side chain cleavage mRNA is increased severalfold to a level equal to, or greater than, basal expression in the Y1-neo control cell line. Treatment with calphostin C also results in recovery of steroidogenesis in the Y1-E cells to a level comparable to the basal level observed in the Y1-neo control cell line. These results indicate that increased expression of PKC in the Y1-E cell lines decreases basal steroidogenesis by suppressing P450-cholesterol side chain cleavage mRNA expression. Inhibition of PKC, however, does not reverse the block in cAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis in Y1-E cells, suggesting that the pleiotropic effects of apoE expression are not mediated entirely through altered PKC expression."
https://openalex.org/W1568306327,"The sensitivity of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme function to amino acid substitutions at defined positions in and around the longitudinal, hydrophobic strips of 9 alpha-helices was assessed after systematic replacement of each residue in the protein with a series of 13 amino acids. The hydrophobic strips were defined by identifying the longitudinal sectors in the helices with the highest mean residue hydrophobicities. Sensitivity to mutation (the percentage of replacements leading to loss of function) was calculated for each residue in the following positions: whole protein, helices, hydrophobic strips, other positions within the helices, and various positions within the hydrophobic strips as well as their extensions beyond the helices. Substitutions at positions in the hydrophobic strips led more frequently to loss of function than substitutions in the protein as a whole. One subset, the COOH-terminal hydrophobic strip residues, is apparently critical; substitutions of these residues (but not of their NH2-terminal counterparts) led at least as frequently to loss of function as substitutions of solvent-inaccessible residues, and nearly as frequently as substitutions of the most highly conserved residues."
