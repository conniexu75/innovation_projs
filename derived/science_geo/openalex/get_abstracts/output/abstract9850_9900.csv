In simulated atmospheres containing 1 part per million nitrogen dioxide and traces of nitric acid, directly mutagenic nitro derivatives are readily formed from both benzo[a]pyrene and perylene, a non-mutagen in the Ames reversion assay. Possible formation of direct mutagens by such reactions on sample collection filters, in exhaust effluents, and in the atmosphere should be recognized."

A parallel experiment with mice indicated that the reduction of birth weight was caused by exposure to corticosteroids rather than to maternal disease or malfunction."

Subjects judged left-side composites as expressing emotions more intensely than right-side composites. The finding indicates hemispheric asymmetry in the control over emotional expression in the face."

On seven of the eight problems, the animal consistently chose the correct photograph. This test problem-solving comprehension permits the animal's knowledge about problem-solving--its ability to infer the nature of problems and to recognize potential solutions to them--to be examined."

https://openalex.org/W1988273890,"Microinjections of the excitatory neurotoxin kainic acid into the lateral hypothalamus of rats produced a period aphagia and adipsia. Kainate-treated rats displayed transient motor effects during the first hours after the injection but did not show the persisting sensory-motor and arousal disturbances typically observed in animals with electrolytic lesions in this part of the hypothalamus. Histological examination revealed a significant reduction in the number of nerve cell bodies in the lateral hypothalamus. Silver-stained material indicated no evidence of damage to fiber systems passing through the affected region. Assays of dopamine in hypothalamus, striatum, and telencephalon did not indicate significant differences between experimental and control animals. These results are in agreement with recent reports of the anatomical and biochemical effects of intracerebral kainic acid injections and suggest that the observed effect on feeding behavior is related to the destruction of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus."

https://openalex.org/W1573141499,"Abstract Complex carbohydrates on the surfaces of eukaryotic cells are thought to participate in a wide variety of cell-cell interactions. A model system has therefore been developed to study these processes. In the present experiments, the ability of chicken hepatocytes to recognize and adhere to sugars covalently linked to polyacrylamide gels was investigated. The gels were snythesized by two methods. Type I gels were prepared from a co-polymer of an active ester of acrylic acid (N-succinimidyl acrylate), acrylamide, and bisacrylamide. The activated polyacrylamide gel was then treated with the desired ligand containing an amino group, such as 6-aminohexyl O- or S-glycoside. Type II gels were formed by treating similar ligands with acryloyl chloride, followed by co-polymerization of the resulting N-substituted acrylamide with acrylamide and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide. These polyacrylamide derivatives offer many advantages for studies with intact cells. They are not toxic to any cell type studied, can be cast in any desired shape, are transparent and stable over a wide range of pH values, and contain no cationic and low to negligible levels of anionic charge (charged groups can be introduced if desired), and the polyacrylamide matrix is stable to common biological agents such as bacteria and enzymes. In addition, type I gels can be synthesized using a broad range of molecules containing amino groups, such as glycopeptides, proteins, etc. The hepatocytes were prepared by collagenase perfusion of intact chicken livers. The rate and extent of adhesion of the cells to the derivatized gels was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase in these cells. This enzyme was also used to assay viability and cell leakiness. At 37 degrees C, 70 to 100% of the cells adhered within 60 min to gels derivatized with N-acetylglucosamine, i.e. gels derivatized with 6-aminohexyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside (or the corresponding thioglycoside). By contrast, less than 5% of the cells adhered to polyacrylamide or to gels derivatized with 6-aminohexanol or the 6-aminohexyl glycosides of beta-D-glucose, beta-D-galactose, alpha-D-mannose, beta-D-maltose, beta-D-melibiose, beta-D-cellobiose, and (alpha or beta)-D-lactose. Kinetic studies with the chicken hepatocytes and N-acetylglucosamine gels showed that cell-gel binding was dependent upon Ca2+ and was decreased at low temperatures. Binding was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine or by glycosides of this sugar, the most effective inhibitor being orosomucoid (alpha1-acid glycoprotein) pretreated with sialidase and beta-galactosidase. The cell surface receptor(s) involved in this interaction is not known, but may be related or identical to the chicken liver binding protein described by Lunney and Ashwell (Lunney, J., and Ashwell, G. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 341--343). The present results suggest that this model system should prove useful in delineating cell surface interactions with carbohydrates."

Positive and negative behavioral contrast may reflect reallocation of competing interim and terminal responses between schedule components following changes in the reinforcement conditions in one component.

https://openalex.org/W2029167770,Cytosol extracts and culture supernatants of isolated egg granulomas obtained from livers of mice with Schistosoma mansoni infection stimulated fibroblasts to incorporate tritiated thymidine and to proliferate in vitro. This finding suggests that hepatic granulomas may play a role in regulating hepatic fibrosis in Schistosoma mansoni infections.

https://openalex.org/W1564585913,"We treated intact reticulocytes with nystatin to make them permeable to small cations and varied the concentration of K+ in the medium; the ionic strength was kept constant by adjusting Na+. As the intracellular K+ was lowered, the rate of protein synthesis decreased. In a reticulocyte lysate, the dependence of the rate of protein synthesis on K+ concentration (at constant ionic strength) was similar to that seen in nystatin-treated cells. We observed no loss of polysomes at low K+. Even when initiation was blocked with aurintricarboxylic acid, decreased K+ inhibited protein synthesis. Analysis of the kinetics of synthesis showed that lowering the K+ concentration inhibits the rate of elongation of nascent chains, but has little effect on the relative rate of initiation of chains."

https://openalex.org/W1542418181,"There are 16 epsilon-amino groups of lysyl residues which are essential for the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. These lysyl residues formed a Schiff base with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate which was stabilized by NaBH4 reduction. The stoichiometry of covalently bound pyridoxal 5'-phosphate after NaBH4 reduction was determined spectrophotometrically with a derived molar extinction coefficient of 4800 M-1 cm-1. The incorporation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate into the protein was accompanied by loss of the carboxylase and oxygenase activities, but the ratio of their activities remained constant. Vmax, but not Km, values were changed by this modification of the amino acid groups. Half of the epsilon-amino groups of lysine appeared to be at the 8 catalytic sites and half at the 8 activator sites for CO2, as indicated by kinetics of reactivation of the enzyme activity during dissociation of the Schiff base between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the protein. Reduction with NaB3H4 revealed that all 16 of the lysyl residues were on the large subunit. Ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate alone protected 16 amino groups from Schiff base formation with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and the enzyme activity was fully conserved. NaHCO3 increased and MgCl2 lowered slightly the protective effect of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Modification of sulfhydryl groups by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid inhibited the enzyme and excluded binding of 8 equivalents of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Upon removal of the mercuribenzoate groups with excess dithiothreitol, the loss of enzyme activity was exponentially correlated with the binding of 8 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate/mol of enzyme. In contrast to p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, iodoacetamide, which inhibited the catalysis, had no influence on the binding of the 16 pyridoxal 5'-phosphate/mol of enzyme. It is suggested that the CO2 activator site with one epsilon-amino group for binding of CO2 and the catalytic site with one epsilon-amino group of a yet unknown function are located closely together on the large subunits of the enzyme. The results are consistent with a sulfhydryl group as the proton acceptor opposite carbon 3 of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, and when this sulfhydryl group is blocked by the bulky mercuribenzoate group, but not by the small carboxyamidomethyl group, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding is modified."
https://openalex.org/W198422522,"A new, rapid, and sensitive assay for phospholipase A, utilizing commercially available [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine with 14C label in both palmitic acid moieties, was used to study phospholipase A release from perfused liver, hepatocytes, and intestinal cells from rats. Heparin triggered a prompt release of phospholipase A from perfused liver. Phospholipase A and triglyceride lipase were released from hepatocytes at a linear rate for 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Heparin (20 u/ml) doubled the release of phospholipase A and triglyceride lipase from hepatocytes. Colchicine (0.1 mM), but not puromycin (0.2 mM), inhibited basal and heparin-stimulated phospholipase A release by 40%. Since the amount of phospholipase A and triglyceride lipase released into the medium greatly exceeded intracellular activities, it is possible that secretion is coupled with intracellular conversion from inactive to active forms of the enzymes. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) inhibited phospholipase A (48%) and triglyceride lipase (82%) release from hepatocytes. Epinephrine, dexamethasone, and clofibrate inhibited release of triglyceride lipase but not phospholipase A. Phospholipase A activity of intestinal cells was greater than in hepatocytes, but neither heparin nor dibutyryl cyclic AMP affected phospholipase A release from intestinal cells. These results suggest that the liver is a major source of phospholipase A of postheparin plasma. The fact that dibutyryl cyclic AMP affects the release of these enzymes suggests an additional mechanism for hormonal regulation of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1520787125,"The present study was undertaken to examine the mechanism by which luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in rat granulosa cells. Immature rats were injected with 20 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and granulosa cells isolated 48 h later. LH (5 microgram/ml) stimulated PGE synthesis markedly over the control with no additions in 6-h incubations (1.98 +/- 0.24 and 0.24 +/- 0.05 ng/2 X 10(6) cells, respectively, n = 6). When arachidonic acid (100 microgram/ml) was included during the last hour of incubation, further increases to 15.4 +/- 2.9 and 2.48 +/- 0.48 ng of PGE/2 X 10(6) cells in LH and control incubations were observed. The cause of the increased response to a 1-h incubation with arachidonic acid in the LH-treated cells did not appear to be a stimulation of fatty acid uptake. In addition, when cellular lipids were labeled by a 2-h incubation with radioactive arachidonic acid, LH did not stimulate intra- or extracellular release of arachidonic acid. A 5-fold stimulation of prostaglandin synthetase activity, however, was observed in cells incubated with LH for 5 h. Our results, therefore, indicate that LH acts at a step in the prostaglandin pathway after hydrolysis of arachidonic acid esters and produces an increase in prostaglandin synthetase activity."

https://openalex.org/W86820158,"The enzymes of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway have been partially co-purified from pigeon liver by a method dependent upon the use of the nonionic polymer polyethylene glycol for enzyme stabilization and cofractionation. Although the enzymes did not appear to constitute a large macromolecular complex it was evident that some particular inter-relationship between them was preserved during the purification procedure. Analysis of the end products and pathway intermediates was carried out primarily by sensitive high pressure liquid chromatographic techniques. Substrate and cofactor requirements were confirmed and optimal conditions of pH, temperature, and K+ ion activation established. At phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) concentrations below 0.3 mM the activity of the first pathway enzyme amidophosphoribosyltransferase was rate-limiting, and the inhibition of this enzyme by AMP regulated the rate of purine ring synthesis. At higher concentrations of PP-ribose-P, aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase, the fifth enzyme of the pathway became rate limiting and was subject to inhibition by added AMP. It was evident that the regulation of purine synthesis was quite complex and that AMP inhibition (perhaps reflected in a low adenylate energy charge) can be effected at different points on the purine pathway."

Solitary tract cells in younger fetuses respond to stimulation of the tongue with fewer salts and acids than do cells in older fetuses, lambs, and adults. Further, responses to specific salts and acids develop in a particular sequence, not randomly. These changes may relate to maturation of taste receptor sites."

https://openalex.org/W1515233586,"As a model for the nonspecific interaction of steroid receptors with DNA, the binding of estradiol.receptor complexes of mouse kidney and uterine cytosols to oligo(dT)-cellulose was studied in detail. A limited concentration range of monovalent cationic salts was required for optimal binding, regardless of prior activation of the receptor complexes or the oligomer ligand. Thermal activation of the receptor complexes did not facilitate binding. The reaction was selective for intracellular steroid hormone.receptor complexes, as extracellular proteins binding estradiol with low affinity (bovine serum albumin) or high affinity (mouse alpha-fetoprotein) were inactive. Both crude and partially purified kidney cytosol receptor complexes bound preferentially to oligo(dT)- and oligo(dC)-celluloses, rather than oligo(dA)-celluloses. These findings suggest that at least part of the nonspecific interaction of estradiol.receptor complexes with native DNA is through a salt-sensitive binding of the complex to pyrimidine-rich surfaces of the DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2086603656,Between 1973 and 1977 the total number of Ph.D.'s holding postdoctoral appointments in the biomedical sciences increased at a rate of more than 550 individuals (12.5 percent) per year. During this same period the total number of doctorates awarded each year in these disciplines showed very little change. The postdoctoral growth can be attributed to substantial increases in both the numbers of recent graduates taking postdoctorals and the length of stay on these appointments. The lack of alternative employment opportunities has contributed heavily to the postdoctoral buildup. Continued growth is likely to have important consequences for biomedical research and research training.
