https://openalex.org/W2909014200,"Regulatory T cells (Treg cells), a distinct subset of CD4+ T cells, are necessary for the maintenance of immune self-tolerance and homeostasis1,2. Recent studies have demonstrated that Treg cells exhibit a unique metabolic profile, characterized by an increase in mitochondrial metabolism relative to other CD4+ effector subsets3,4. Furthermore, the Treg cell lineage-defining transcription factor, Foxp3, has been shown to promote respiration5,6; however, it remains unknown whether the mitochondrial respiratory chain is required for the T cell-suppression capacity, stability and survival of Treg cells. Here we report that Treg cell-specific ablation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III in mice results in the development of fatal inflammatory disease early in life, without affecting Treg cell number. Mice that lack mitochondrial complex III specifically in Treg cells displayed a loss of T cell-suppression capacity without altering Treg cell proliferation and survival. Treg cells deficient in complex III showed decreased expression of genes associated with Treg function, whereas Foxp3 expression remained stable. Loss of complex III in Treg cells increased DNA methylation as well as the metabolites 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and succinate that inhibit the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA demethylases7. Thus, Treg cells require mitochondrial complex III to maintain immune regulatory gene expression and suppressive function."
https://openalex.org/W2908798728,"The genome is partitioned into topologically associated domains and genomic compartments with shared chromatin valence. This architecture is constrained by the DNA polymer, which precludes interactions between genes on different chromosomes. Here we report a marked divergence from this pattern of nuclear organization that occurs in mouse olfactory sensory neurons. Chromatin conformation capture using in situ Hi-C on fluorescence-activated cell-sorted olfactory sensory neurons and their progenitors shows that olfactory receptor gene clusters from 18 chromosomes make specific and robust interchromosomal contacts that increase with differentiation of the cells. These contacts are orchestrated by intergenic olfactory receptor enhancers, the 'Greek islands', which first contribute to the formation of olfactory receptor compartments and then form a multi-chromosomal super-enhancer that associates with the single active olfactory receptor gene. The Greek-island-bound transcription factor LHX2 and adaptor protein LDB1 regulate the assembly and maintenance of olfactory receptor compartments, Greek island hubs and olfactory receptor transcription, providing mechanistic insights into and functional support for the role of trans interactions in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2908730896,"Apical growth in plants initiates upon seed germination, whereas radial growth is primed only during early ontogenesis in procambium cells and activated later by the vascular cambium1. Although it is not known how radial growth is organized and regulated in plants, this system resembles the developmental competence observed in some animal systems, in which pre-existing patterns of developmental potential are established early on2,3. Here we show that in Arabidopsis the initiation of radial growth occurs around early protophloem-sieve-element cell files of the root procambial tissue. In this domain, cytokinin signalling promotes the expression of a pair of mobile transcription factors—PHLOEM EARLY DOF 1 (PEAR1) and PHLOEM EARLY DOF 2 (PEAR2)—and their four homologues (DOF6, TMO6, OBP2 and HCA2), which we collectively name PEAR proteins. The PEAR proteins form a short-range concentration gradient that peaks at protophloem sieve elements, and activates gene expression that promotes radial growth. The expression and function of PEAR proteins are antagonized by the HD-ZIP III proteins, well-known polarity transcription factors4—the expression of which is concentrated in the more-internal domain of radially non-dividing procambial cells by the function of auxin, and mobile miR165 and miR166 microRNAs. The PEAR proteins locally promote transcription of their inhibitory HD-ZIP III genes, and thereby establish a negative-feedback loop that forms a robust boundary that demarks the zone of cell division. Taken together, our data establish that during root procambial development there exists a network in which a module that links PEAR and HD-ZIP III transcription factors integrates spatial information of the hormonal domains and miRNA gradients to provide adjacent zones of dividing and more-quiescent cells, which forms a foundation for further radial growth. Radial growth in the roots of Arabidopsis, which is mediated by gene expression activated by the mobile PEAR1 and PEAR2 transcription factors, is initiated around protophloem-sieve-element cell files of procambial tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2910341377,"In mammals, 2′-O-methylation of RNA is a molecular signature by which the cellular innate immune system distinguishes endogenous from exogenous messenger RNA1–3. However, the molecular functions of RNA 2′-O-methylation are not well understood. Here we have purified TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and its interacting partners and identified a DICER-independent TRBP complex containing FTSJ3, a putative 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′O-MTase). In vitro and ex vivo experiments show that FTSJ3 is a 2′O-MTase that is recruited to HIV RNA through TRBP. Using RiboMethSeq analysis4, we identified predominantly FTSJ3-dependent 2′-O-methylations at specific residues on the viral genome. HIV-1 viruses produced in FTSJ3 knockdown cells show reduced 2′-O-methylation and trigger expression of type 1 interferons (IFNs) in human dendritic cells through the RNA sensor MDA5. This induction of IFN-α and IFN-β leads to a reduction in HIV expression. We have identified an unexpected mechanism used by HIV-1 to evade innate immune recognition: the recruitment of the TRBP–FTSJ3 complex to viral RNA and its 2′-O-methylation. HIV-1 uses the host protein FTSJ3 to methylate its own genome, thereby evading detection by the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2909422392,"The development of neural circuits relies on axon projections establishing diverse, yet well-defined, connections between areas of the nervous system. Each projection is formed by growth cones-subcellular specializations at the tips of growing axons, encompassing sets of molecules that control projection-specific growth, guidance, and target selection1. To investigate the set of molecules within native growth cones that form specific connections, here we developed growth cone sorting and subcellular RNA-proteome mapping, an approach that identifies and quantifies local transcriptomes and proteomes from labelled growth cones of single projections in vivo. Using this approach on the developing callosal projection of the mouse cerebral cortex, we mapped molecular enrichments in trans-hemispheric growth cones relative to their parent cell bodies, producing paired subcellular proteomes and transcriptomes from single neuron subtypes directly from the brain. These data provide generalizable proof-of-principle for this approach, and reveal molecular specializations of the growth cone, including accumulations of the growth-regulating kinase mTOR2, together with mRNAs that contain mTOR-dependent motifs3,4. These findings illuminate the relationships between subcellular distributions of RNA and protein in developing projection neurons, and provide a systems-level approach for the discovery of subtype- and stage-specific molecular substrates of circuit wiring, miswiring, and the potential for regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2910094524,"To initiate infection, many viruses enter their host cells by triggering endocytosis following receptor engagement. However, the mechanisms by which non-enveloped viruses escape the endosome are poorly understood. Here we present near-atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures for feline calicivirus both undecorated and labelled with a soluble fragment of its cellular receptor, feline junctional adhesion molecule A. We show that VP2, a minor capsid protein encoded by all caliciviruses1,2, forms a large portal-like assembly at a unique three-fold axis of symmetry, following receptor engagement. This assembly-which was not detected in undecorated virions-is formed of twelve copies of VP2, arranged with their hydrophobic N termini pointing away from the virion surface. Local rearrangement at the portal site leads to the opening of a pore in the capsid shell. We hypothesize that the portal-like assembly functions as a channel for the delivery of the calicivirus genome, through the endosomal membrane, into the cytoplasm of a host cell, thereby initiating infection. VP2 was previously known to be critical for the production of infectious virus3; our findings provide insights into its structure and function that advance our understanding of the Caliciviridae."
https://openalex.org/W2910646116,"Omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid supplementation enhances muscle protein synthesis and muscle size. Whether n-3 fatty acid supplementation attenuates human muscle disuse atrophy is unknown. We determined the influence of n-3 fatty acid supplementation on muscle size, mass, and integrated rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) following 2 wk of muscle disuse and recovery in women. Twenty women (BMI = 23.0 ± 2.3 kg/m2, age = 22 ± 3 yr) underwent 2 wk of unilateral limb immobilization followed by 2 wk of return to normal activity. Starting 4 wk prior to immobilization, participants consumed either 5 g/d of n-3 fatty acid or an isoenergetic quantity of sunflower oil (control). Muscle size and mass were measured pre- and postimmobilization, and after recovery. Serial muscle biopsies were obtained to measure integrated (daily) MyoPS. Following immobilization, the decline in muscle volume was greater in the control group compared to the n-3 fatty acid group (14 vs. 8%, P < 0.05) and was not different from preimmobilization at recovery in the n-3 fatty acid group; however, it was still lower in the control group ( P < 0.05). Muscle mass was reduced in the control group only ( P < 0.05). MyoPS was higher in the n-3 group compared with the control group at all times ( P < 0.05). We conclude that n-3 fatty acid supplementation attenuates skeletal muscle disuse atrophy in young women, which may be mediated by higher rates of MyoPS.-McGlory, C., Gorissen, S. H. M., Kamal, M., Bahniwal, R., Hector, A. J., Baker, S. K., Chabowski, A., Phillips, S. M. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation attenuates skeletal muscle disuse atrophy during two weeks of unilateral leg immobilization in healthy young women."
https://openalex.org/W2910191461,"A key regulated step of transcription is promoter melting by RNA polymerase (RNAP) to form the open promoter complex1-3. To generate the open complex, the conserved catalytic core of the RNAP combines with initiation factors to locate promoter DNA, unwind 12-14 base pairs of the DNA duplex and load the template-strand DNA into the RNAP active site. Formation of the open complex is a multi-step process during which transient intermediates of unknown structure are formed4-6. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of bacterial RNAP-promoter DNA complexes, including structures of partially melted intermediates. The structures show that late steps of promoter melting occur within the RNAP cleft, delineate key roles for fork-loop 2 and switch 2-universal structural features of RNAP-in restricting access of DNA to the RNAP active site, and explain why clamp opening is required to allow entry of single-stranded template DNA into the active site. The key roles of fork-loop 2 and switch 2 suggest a common mechanism for late steps in promoter DNA opening to enable gene expression across all domains of life."
https://openalex.org/W2953033333,"Bacterial overgrowth in the uterus is a normal event after parturition. In contrast to the healthy cow, animals unable to control the infection within 21 days after calving develop postpartum endometritis. Studies on the Microbial Ecology of the bovine reproductive tract have focused on either vaginal or uterine microbiomes. This is the first study that compares both microbiomes in the same animals. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of the 16S rRNA gene showed that despite large differences associated to individuals, a shared community exist in vagina and uterus during the postpartum period. The largest changes associated with development of endometritis were observed at 7 days postpartum, a time when vaginal and uterine microbiomes were most similar. 16S rRNA pyrosequencing of the vaginal microbiome at 7 days postpartum showed at least three different microbiome types that were associated with later development of postpartum endometritis. All three microbiome types featured reduced bacterial diversity. Taken together, the above findings support a scenario where disruption of the compartmentalization of the reproductive tract during parturition results in the dispersal and mixing of the vaginal and uterine microbiomes, which subsequently are subject to differentiation. This differentiation was observed early postpartum in the healthy cow. In contrast, loss of bacterial diversity and dominance of the microbiome by few bacterial taxa were related to a delayed succession at 7DPP in cows that at 21 DPP or later were diagnosed with endometritis."
https://openalex.org/W2951949069,"The pleasurable desire to move to music, also known as groove, is modulated by rhythmic complexity. How the sensation of groove is influenced by other musical features, such as the harmonic complexity of individual chords, is less clear. To address this, we asked people with a range of musical experience to rate stimuli that varied in both rhythmic and harmonic complexity. Rhythm showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with ratings of pleasure and wanting to move, whereas medium and low complexity chords were rated similarly. Pleasure mediated the effect of harmony on wanting to move and high complexity chords attenuated the effect of rhythm on pleasure. We suggest that while rhythmic complexity is the primary driver, harmony, by altering emotional valence, modulates the attentional and temporal prediction processes that underlie rhythm perception. Investigation of the effects of musical training with both regression and group comparison showed that training increased the inverted U effect for harmony and rhythm, respectively. Taken together, this work provides important new information about how the prediction and entrainment processes involved in rhythm perception interact with musical pleasure."
https://openalex.org/W2910814369,"Mesothelioma is a lung cancer that kills thousands of people worldwide annually, especially those with exposure to asbestos. Diagnosis of mesothelioma in patients often requires time-consuming imaging techniques and biopsies. Machine learning can provide for a more effective, cheaper, and faster patient diagnosis and feature selection from clinical data in patient records.We analyzed a dataset of health records of 324 patients having mesothelioma symptoms from Turkey. The patients had prior asbestos exposure and displayed symptoms consistent with mesothelioma. We compared probabilistic neural network, perceptron-based neural network, random forest, one rule, and decision tree classifiers to predict diagnosis of the patient records. We measured classifiers' performance through standard confusion matrix scores such as Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Random forest outperformed all models tried, obtaining MCC = +0.37 on the complete imbalanced dataset and MCC = +0.64 on the under-sampled balanced dataset. We then employed random forest feature selection to identify the two most relevant dataset traits associated with mesothelioma: lung side and platelet count. These two risk factors resulted so predictive, that decision tree focusing on them achieved the second top accuracy on the complete dataset diagnosis prediction (MCC = +0.28), outperforming all other methods and even decision tree itself applied to all features.Our results show that machine learning can predict diagnoses of patients having mesothelioma symptoms with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, in few minutes. Additionally, random forest can efficiently select the most important features of this clinical dataset (lung side and platelet count) in few seconds. The importance of pleural plaques in lung sides and blood platelets in mesothelioma diagnosis indicates that physicians should focus on these two features when reading records of patients with mesothelioma symptoms. Moreover, doctors can exploit our machinery to predict patient diagnosis when only lung side and platelet data are available."
https://openalex.org/W2909892186,"Preparation of high-quality sequencing libraries is a costly and time-consuming component of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). While the overall cost of sequencing has dropped significantly over recent years, the reagents needed to prepare sequencing samples are likely to become the dominant expense in the process. Furthermore, libraries prepared by hand are subject to human variability and needless waste due to limitations of manual pipetting volumes. Reduction of reaction volumes, combined with sub-microliter automated dispensing of reagents without consumable pipette tips, has the potential to provide significant advantages. Here, we describe the integration of several instruments, including the Labcyte Echo 525 acoustic liquid handler and the iSeq and NovaSeq Illumina sequencing platforms, to miniaturize and automate mNGS library preparation, significantly reducing the cost and the time required to prepare samples. Through the use of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in RNAs, we demonstrated the fidelity of the miniaturized preparation to be equivalent to full volume reactions. Furthermore, detection of viral and microbial species from cell culture and patient samples was also maintained in the miniaturized libraries. For 384-well mNGS library preparations, we achieved cost savings of over 80% in materials and reagents alone, and reduced preparation time by 90% compared to manual approaches, without compromising quality or representation within the library."
https://openalex.org/W2910130606,"Background Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for 15% of AIDS-related mortality. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is detected in blood weeks before onset of meningitis, and CrAg positivity is an independent predictor of meningitis and death. CrAg screening for patients with advanced HIV and preemptive treatment is recommended by the World Health Organization, though implementation remains limited. Our objective was to evaluate costs and mortality reduction (lives saved) from a national CrAg screening program across Uganda. Methods We created a decision analytic model to evaluate CrAg screening. CrAg screening was considered for those with a CD4<100 cells/μL per national and international guidelines, and in the context of a national HIV test-and-treat program where CD4 testing was not available. Costs (2016 USD) were estimated for screening, preemptive therapy, hospitalization, and maintenance therapy. Parameter assumptions were based on large prospective CrAg screening studies in Uganda, and clinical trials from sub Saharan Africa. CrAg positive (CrAg+) persons could be: (a) asymptomatic and thus eligible for preemptive treatment with fluconazole; or (b) symptomatic with meningitis with hospitalization. Results In the base case model for 1 million persons with a CD4 test annually, 128,000 with a CD4<100 cells/μL were screened, and 8,233 were asymptomatic CrAg+ and received preemptive therapy. Compared to no screening and treatment, CrAg screening and treatment in the base case cost $3,356,724 compared to doing nothing, and saved 7,320 lives, for a cost of $459 per life saved, with the $3.3 million in cost savings derived from fewer patients developing fulminant meningitis. In the scenario of a national HIV test-and-treat program, of 1 million HIV-infected persons, 800,000 persons were screened, of whom 640,000 returned to clinic, and 8,233 were incident CrAg positive (CrAg prevalence 1.4%). The total cost of a CrAg screening and treatment program was $4.16 million dollars, with 2,180 known deaths. Conversely, without CrAg screening, the cost of treating meningitis was $3.09 million dollars with 3,806 deaths. Thus, despite the very low CrAg prevalence of 1.4% in the general HIV-infected population, and inadequate retention-in-care, CrAg screening averted 43% of deaths from cryptococcal meningitis at a cost of $662 per death averted. Conclusion CrAg screening and treatment programs are cost-saving and lifesaving, assuming preemptive treatment is 77% effective in preventing death, and could be adopted and implemented by ministries of health to reduce mortality in those with advanced HIV disease. Even within HIV test-and-treat programs where CD4 testing is not performed, and CrAg prevalence is only 1.4%, CrAg screening is cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W2910136408,"A maternal high-fat/sucrose diet, in the presence of maternal obesity, can program increased susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disease in offspring. In particular, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease risk is associated with poor maternal nutrition and obesity status, which may manifest via alterations in gut microbiota. Here, we report that in a preclinical model of diet-induced maternal obesity, maternal supplementation of a high-fat/sucrose diet with the prebiotic oligofructose improves glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic steatosis in offspring following a long-term high-fat/sucrose dietary challenge compared with offspring of untreated dams. These improvements are associated with alterations in gut microbial composition and serum inflammatory profiles in early life and improvements in inflammatory and fatty-acid gene expression profiles in tissues. Serum metabolomics analysis highlights potential metabolic links between the gut microbiota and the degree of steatosis, including alterations in 1-carbon metabolism. Overall, our data suggest that maternal prebiotic intake protects offspring against hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance following 21 wk of high fat/sucrose diet, which is in part due to alterations in gut microbiota.-Paul, H. A., Collins, K. H., Nicolucci, A. C., Urbanski, S. J., Hart, D. A., Vogel, H. J., Reimer, R. A.

https://openalex.org/W2910370474,"Chemosensory signaling in organs such as the mouth and gut contributes to the mechanisms that control metabolism. We investigated the chemosensory pathways that regulate secretion of the hunger hormone ghrelin in response to neurotransmitters, bitter and sweet tastants at the cellular level in the human gut mucosa, and the disturbances in this regulatory pathway induced by obesity. Obesity impaired ghrelin protein production and adrenalin-induced ghrelin secretion in fundic cells, which was counterbalanced by somatostatin. Bitter agonists selective for taste receptor type 2 (TAS2Rs), TAS2R5 and TAS2R10 stimulated ghrelin secretion in fundic cells. The stimulatory effect of the broadly tuned bitter agonist, denatonium benzoate, was selectively blunted by obesity in the small intestine but not in the fundus. Luminal glucose concentrations inhibited ghrelin secretion via sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter and taste receptor type 1 member 3. Obesity altered the sensitivity of the ghrelin cell to glucose in the small intestine but not in the fundus. Sweet taste receptor activation inhibited bitter taste signaling of the ghrelin cell. In conclusion, obesity impairs the sympathetic drive that controls ghrelin release in the fundus and affects the sensitivity of the ghrelin cell to bitter and sweet stimuli in the small intestine but not in the fundus. Region-selective targeting of gut taste receptors in obesity is indicated.—Wang, Q., Liszt, K. I., Deloose, E., Canovai, E., Thijs, T., Farré, R., Ceulemans, L.

https://openalex.org/W2911062110,"British Columbia (BC), Canada declared a public health emergency in April 2016 for opioid overdose. Comprehensive data was needed to identify risk factors, inform interventions, and evaluate response actions. We describe the development of an overdose cohort, including linkage strategy, case definitions, and data governance model, and present the resulting characteristics, including data linkage yields and case overlap among data sources.Overdose events from hospital admissions, physician visits, poison centre and ambulance calls, emergency department visits, and coroner's data were grouped into episodes if records were present in multiple sources. A minimum of five years of universal health care records (all prescription dispensations, fee-for-service physician billings, emergency department visits and hospitalizations) were appended for each individual. A 20% random sample of BC residents and a 1:5 matched case-control set were generated. Consultation and prioritization ensured analysts worked to address questions to directly inform public health actions.10,456 individuals suffered 14,292 overdoses from January 1, 2015 to Nov 30, 2016. Only 28% of overdose events were found in more than one dataset with the unique contribution of cases highest from ambulance records (32%). Compared with fatal overdoses, non-fatal events more often involved females, younger individuals (20 to 29 years) and those 60 or older. In 78% of illegal drug deaths, there was no associated ambulance response. In the year prior to first recorded overdose, 60% of individuals had at least one ED visit, 31% at least one hospital admission, 80% at least one physician visit, and 87% had filled at least one prescription in a community pharmacy.While resource-intensive to establish, a linked cohort is useful for characterizing the full extent of the epidemic, defining sub-populations at risk, and patterns of contact with the health system. Overdose studies in other jurisdictions should consider the inclusion of multiple data sources."
https://openalex.org/W2908651603,"Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have a global distribution, but the population inhabiting the Gulf of California (GoC) is thought to be geographically and genetically isolated. However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either ""area-restricted searching"" (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or ""transiting"" (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean = 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean = 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale's return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population."
https://openalex.org/W2908730279,"Rare bacterial species have recently attracted interest due to their many potential beneficial functions. However, only little is known about their cultivability. In this study we test the hypotheses that the use of flow cell-sorting for cultivation results in a high proportion of rare soil bacterial isolates relative to bacterial taxa that are abundant in soil. Moreover, we investigate whether different oligotrophic cultivation media and a prolonged incubation time increase the number of cultivated rare species. In a cultivation study we used flow cell sorting to select for small cells and to separate single cells, and grew bacteria on different oligotrophic media with prolonged incubation times. The abundance of the isolates in the field was assessed by comparing them to a 454-sequencing dataset from the same soil. Consequentially, all bacterial isolates were classified as either rare (<0.01% relative abundance) or abundant (>0.01% relative abundance) in the field soil. We found more bacterial taxa among the isolates that were abundant in soil than would be expected by the proportion of abundant species in the field. Neither incubation time nor growth medium had an influence on the recovery of rare species. However, we did find differences in time until visible growth on the plate between different phylogenetic classes of the isolates. These results indicate that rare cultivable species are active and not more likely to be dormant than abundant species, as has been suggested as a reason for their rarity. Moreover, future studies should be aware of the influence incubation time might have on the phylogenetic composition of the isolate collection."
https://openalex.org/W2949519145,"Melatonin has protective roles in normal cells and cytotoxic actions in cancer cells, with effects involving autophagy and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor pathways. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induces oxidative damage and apoptosis. These consequences activate autophagy, which degrades damaged cellular content, as well as activates Nrf2 the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor, and thereby the expression of protective genes. Melatonin has protective roles in normal cells and cytotoxic actions in cancer cells, with effects involving autophagy and Nrf2 pathways. The current study shows melatonin to differentially modulate autophagy and Nrf2 pathways in tumor and normal placental cells exposed to H/R. BeWo, a human placental choriocarcinoma cell line, and primary villous cytotrophoblasts isolated from normal term placenta, were maintained in normoxia (8% O2) for 24 h or exposed to hypoxia (0.5% of O2 for 4 h) followed by 20 h of normoxia, creating a situation of H/R, in the presence or absence of 1 mM melatonin. Melatonin induced a 7-fold increase in the activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)α, an upstream modulator of autophagy, rising to a 16-fold increase in BeWo cells co-exposed to H/R and melatonin, compared to controls. H/R induced autophagosome formation via the increased expression of Beclin-1 (by 94%) and ATG7 (by 97%) in BeWo cells. Moreover, H/R also induced autophagic activity, indicated by the by the 630% increase in P62, and increased Nrf2 by 314% in BeWo cells. In H/R conditions, melatonin reduced autophagic activity by 74% and Nrf2 expression activation by 300%, leading to BeWo cell apoptosis. In contrast, In human primary villous cytotrophoblasts, H/R induced autophagy and Nrf2, which melatonin further potentiated, thereby affording protection against H/R. This study demonstrates that melatonin differentially modulates autophagy and the Nrf2 pathway in normal vs. tumor trophoblast cells, being cytoprotective in normal cells whilst increasing apoptosis in tumoral trophoblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2950218517,"No-take marine reserves (NTRs), i.e. areas with total fishing restrictions, have been established worldwide aiming to promote biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. Brazil has 3.3% of its exclusive economic zone protected by 73 different NTRs, however, most of them currently lack scientific knowledge and understanding of their ecological role, particularly regarding rocky reefs in subtropical regions. In this context, this study aimed to contrast a network of NTRs with comparable fished sites across a coastal biogeographic gradient to investigate the effect of fishing and habitat variability on the abundance and body size of rocky reef fish. We used Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video (stereo-BRUVs) and Diver Operated stereo-Video (stereo-DOVs) systems to simultaneously sample reef fish and habitat. Model selection and results identified habitat and biogeographic variables, such as distance from shore, as important predictor variables, explaining several aspects of the fish assemblage. The effect of protection was important in determining the abundance and body size of targeted species, in particular for epinephelids and carangids. Conversely, species richness was correlated with habitat complexity but not with protection status. This is the first study using these survey methods in the Southwestern Atlantic, demonstrating how a network of NTRs can provide benchmarks for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management."
https://openalex.org/W2910767285,"The cell cycle is under circadian regulation. Oncogenes can dysregulate circadian-regulated genes to disrupt the cell cycle, promoting tumor cell proliferation. As a regulator of G2/M arrest in response to DNA damage, the circadian gene Timeless Circadian Clock (TIMELESS) coordinates this connection and is a potential locus for oncogenic manipulation. TIMELESS expression was evaluated using RNASeq data from TCGA and by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis in a panel of colon cancer cell lines. TIMELESS expression following ERK inhibition was examined via western blot. Cell metabolic capacity, propidium iodide, and CFSE staining were used to evaluate the effect of TIMELESS depletion on colon cancer cell survival and proliferation. Cell metabolic capacity following TIMELESS depletion in combination with Wee1 or CHK1 inhibition was assessed. TIMELESS is overexpressed in cancer and required for increased cancer cell proliferation. ERK activation promotes TIMELESS expression. TIMELESS depletion increases γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, and triggers G2/M arrest via increased CHK1 and CDK1 phosphorylation. TIMELESS depletion in combination with Wee1 or CHK1 inhibition causes an additive decrease in cancer cell metabolic capacity with limited effects in non-transformed human colon epithelial cells. The data show that ERK activation contributes to the overexpression of TIMELESS in cancer. Depletion of TIMELESS increases γH2AX and causes G2/M arrest, limiting cell proliferation. These results demonstrate a role for TIMELESS in cancer and encourage further examination of the link between circadian rhythm dysregulation and cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2909556784,"Because the association between sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)/apolipoprotein M (ApoM) and chronic kidney diseases has not been established, we investigated the involvement of S1P/ApoM in the phenotypes of IgA nephropathy in hyper-IgA (HIGA) mice. The overexpression of ApoM in adenoviral gene transfer ameliorated the phenotypes of IgA nephropathy in HIGA mice, whereas the knockdown of ApoM with siRNA caused deterioration. When ApoM-overexpressing HIGA mice were treated with VPC23019, an antagonist against S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) and 3 (S1P3), we observed that the protective effects of ApoM were reversed, whereas JTE013, an antagonist against S1P2, did not inhibit the effects. We also found that S1P bound to albumin accelerated the proliferation of MES13 cells and the fibrotic changes of HK2 cells, which were inhibited by JTE013, whereas S1P bound to ApoM suppressed these changes, which were inhibited by VPC23019. These results suggest that S1P bound to ApoM possesses properties protective against the phenotypes of IgA nephropathy through S1P1 and S1P3, whereas S1P bound to albumin exerts deteriorating effects through S1P2. ApoM may be useful as a therapeutic target to treat or retard the progression of IgA nephropathy.-Kurano, M., Tsuneyama, K., Morimoto, Y., Nishikawa, M., Yatomi, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2952694408,"Faces play important roles in the social lives of humans. Besides real faces, people also encounter numerous cartoon faces in daily life which convey basic emotional states through facial expressions. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we conducted a facial expression recognition experiment with 17 university students to compare the processing of cartoon faces with that of real faces. This study used face type (real vs. cartoon), emotion valence (happy vs. angry) and participant gender (male vs. female) as independent variables. Reaction time, recognition accuracy, and the amplitudes and latencies of emotion processing-related ERP components such as N170, VPP (vertex positive potential), and LPP (late positive potential) were used as dependent variables. The ERP results revealed that cartoon faces caused larger N170 and VPP amplitudes as well as a briefer N170 latency than did real faces; that real faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did cartoon faces. In addition, the results showed a significant difference in the brain regions as reflected in a right hemispheric advantage. The behavioral results showed that the reaction times for happy faces were shorter than those for angry faces; that females showed a higher accuracy than did males; and that males showed a higher recognition accuracy for angry faces than happy faces. Due to the sample size, these results may suggestively but not rigorously demonstrate differences in facial expression recognition and neurological processing between cartoon faces and real faces. Cartoon faces showed a higher processing intensity and speed than real faces during the early processing stage. However, more attentional resources were allocated for real faces during the late processing stage."
https://openalex.org/W2910917771,"Purpose Management of leptomeningeal metastasis-related hydrocephalus (LM-H) is particularly challenging regarding the control of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting due to intracranial hypertension. To investigate the improvements of performance status and outcome with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt surgery for LM-H in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods Data on patients with leptomeningeal metastasis-related hydrocephalus from lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed by MR imaging and/or cytological examination were retrospectively analyzed. Between August 2008 and July 2017, the authors reviewed 31 patients requiring CSF shunt, who underwent ventriculo-peritoneal or lumbo-peritoneal shunt. Results The patients consisted of 11 men and 20 women with a median age of 59 years. Twenty-six patients received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). CSF shunt surgery yielded rapid improvement in the performance status of 90.3% of patients. Median overall survival from the diagnosis of LM in patients with ECOG performance status less than 2 was 7.7 months, and this was significantly longer than those in patients with PS 3 or 4 (4.4 or 1.5 months; p<0.001). Multivariate analysis by Cox regression revealed survival differences according to PS at diagnosis of LM [PS 1–3 vs. PS4, hazard ratio (HR) 0.201, p = 0.034], controlled extracranial disease (HR 0.248, p = 0.005), and post-shunt EGFR-TKI for LM treatment (HR 0.193, p = 0.008). Postoperative symptomatic peritoneal carcinomatosis was observed in one patient (3.2%). Conclusion CSF shunting may be a safe and effective strategy in patients with LM-H from lung adenocarcinoma. A prospective study is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of palliative CSF shunt for LM-H."
https://openalex.org/W2952289437,"Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is rapidly becoming an indispensable clinical tool with its different forms. Animal data are crucially needed for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tES. For reproducibility of results in animal experiments, the electric fields (E-Fields) inside the brain parenchyma induced by the injected currents need to be predicted accurately. In this study, we measured the electrical fields in the rat brain perpendicular to the brain surface, i.e. vertical electric field (VE-field), when the stimulation electrode was placed over the skin, skull, or dura mater through a craniotomy hole. The E-field attenuation through the skin was a few times larger than that of the skull and the presence of skin substantially reduced the VE-field peak at the cortical surface near the electrode. The VE-field declined much quicker in the gray matter underneath the pial surface than it did in the white matter, and thus the large VE-fields were contained mostly in the gray matter. The transition at the gray/white matter border caused a significant peak in the VE-field, as well as at other local inhomogeneties. A conductivity value of 0.57 S/m is predicted as a global value for the whole brain by matching our VE-field measurements to the field profile given by analytical equations for volume conductors. Finally, insertion of the current return electrode into the shoulder, submandibular, and hind leg muscles had virtually no effects on the measured E-field amplitudes in the cortex underneath the epidural electrodes."
https://openalex.org/W2910276424,"Background The elderly are at high risk from influenza, in part because immunity wanes with age and through the accumulation of comorbidities. A novel plant-derived virus-like-particle (VLP) vaccine bearing influenza hemagglutinin can induce a balanced humoral and cellular response in old mice (16–18 months) while split virion vaccines elicit mostly antibodies. Because mice also collect comorbidities and lose immune competence as they age, we wished to determine how the plant-derived VLP vaccine would perform in animals approaching the end of their life-span. Materials and methods Old (24–26 months) female BALB/c mice received two intramuscular doses of H1-VLP vaccine, an inactivated H1N1 vaccine (IIV) (both based on A/H1N1/California/07/09) (3μg each) or PBS. Serum was collected on day 42 and humoral responses were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Influenza-specific splenocyte CD4+ & CD8+ T cell responses were measured by flow cytometry. Full body computed tomography (CT) and structured necropsies were performed on day 42. Comorbidities including reduced lung volume (kyphosis), masses, abscesses, etc. were assessed using a standard scoring system (1–21) and mice with scores ≥5 were considered to have important comorbidities. Results Overall, 53.3% of the animals had significant comorbidities. Three weeks post-boost, HI and MN titres were mostly undetectable but ELISA titres were significantly higher in the H1-VLP animals compared to the IIV group (GMT (95% CI): 961 (427, 2163) vs 425 (200, 903): p = 0.03). Both CD4+(TNFα, IFNγ) and CD8+ (IFNγ) T cell responses were also greater in the H1-VLP group than the IIV. Conclusions Even in very old mice with comorbidities, the plant-made H1-VLP vaccine elicited a stronger and more balanced immune response than IIV. Animals with fewer comorbidities tended to have the better composite (humoral and cellular) responses. These novel vaccines have the potential to address some of the limitations of current vaccines in the elderly."

The primary outcome was the difference between groups in accumulated time of interval walking training across 12 weeks. All patients were encouraged to use the InterWalk application to perform IWT for ≥90 minute/week. Patients in the experimental group made individual goals regarding lifestyle change. Once a week inquiries about exercise adherence was made using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA). In case of consistent self-reported non-adherence, the patients would receive a phone-call inquiring about the reason for non-adherence. The control group did not receive additional support. Information about training adherence was assessed objectively. Usability of the EMA was assessed based on response rates and self-reported satisfaction after 12-weeks.Thirty-seven patients with T2D (66 years, 65% female, hemoglobin 1Ac 50.3 mmol/mol) where included (n = 18 and n = 19 in experimental and control group, respectively). The retention rate was 83%. The experimental group accumulated [95%CI] 345 [-7, 698] minutes of IWT more than the control group. The response rate for the text-messages was 83% (68% for males and 90% for females). Forty-one percent of the experimental and 25% of the control group were very satisfied with their participation.The combination inquiry about adherence using EMA, goal-setting with the possibility of follow-up phone calls are considered feasible interventions to attain training adherence when using the InterWalk app during a 12-week period in patients with T2D. Some uncertainty about the effect size of adherence remains.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02089477."

We hypothesized that serum Hsp90 may have utility as a biomarker of type 1 diabetes risk and exhibit elevations before the onset of clinically significant hyperglycemia. To this end, total levels of the alpha cytoplasmic isoform of Hsp90 were assayed in autoantibody-positive progressors to type 1 diabetes using banked serum samples from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Cohort that had been collected 12 months prior to diabetes onset, with comparison to age, sex, and BMI-category matched autoantibody-positive nonprogressors and healthy controls. Hsp90 levels were higher in autoantibody-positive progressors and nonprogressors ≤ 18 years of age compared to matched healthy controls. However, Hsp90 levels were not different between progressors and nonprogressors in any age group. Hsp90 was positively correlated with age in control subjects, but this correlation was absent in autoantibody positive individuals. In aggregate these data indicate that elevated Hsp90 levels are present in youth with β cell autoimmunity, but are not able to distinguish youth or adult type 1 diabetes progressors from nonprogressors in samples collected 12 months prior to diabetes development."

In this study, we extensively compare the designs of two distributed-circuit based RF coils: the Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT) head coil and TEM head coil on multiple anatomically detailed head models and in-vivo. Bench measurements of s-parameters and experimental B1+ field distribution were obtained in volunteers and compared with numerical simulations. RF absorption, quantified by both average and peak SAR, and B1+ field intensity and homogeneity, calculated/measured in terms of maximum over minimum and coefficient of variation (CV) in the region of interest (ROI), are presented for both coils.

https://openalex.org/W2910089144,"Introduction In most developing countries like Uganda, antimicrobials including β-lactams and tetracyclines are used indiscriminately in livestock. When livestock get sick and treatment is necessary, some producers and veterinarians use these drugs with minimal controls to prevent residues from occurring in the beef sent to markets. This study was done to determine the presence of drug residues above acceptable limits of two commonly used antimicrobials in Uganda’s rural and urban beef. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted of 134 cattle carcasses from eight different slaughter slabs over twelve weeks. This study entailed 81 samples of rural and 53 samples of urban origin. To enable detailed analysis these samples were categorized according to age (maturity), breed, and sex. For each of the 134 carcasses, three samples of liver, kidney and muscle were taken and homogeneously mixed into one sample, which was tested for β-lactam and tetracycline drug residues. Results The results were statistically significant for β-lactam levels (χ2 = 22.10, df = 10, p = 0.0146) with average concentration (μg/kg) of 2.93:29.3 (rural: urban), though not for tetracycline levels (χ2 = 3.594, df = 10, P = 0.9638) with average concentration (μg/kg) of 5.028:12.83 (rural: urban). Age (maturity) had significant effect at all values of antibiotic level (F(1, 68) = 5.06, p = 0.0278). Age effect was extremely significant (F(1, 68) = 15.51, p = 0.0002). Conclusion A significant difference existed in drug residue proportions of β-lactam and tetracycline antimicrobials among Uganda’s rural and urban beef. A significant difference also occured in drug residue proportions of these two commonly used antimicrobials related to age (maturity), but neither breed, nor sex, of Uganda’s rural and urban beef."
https://openalex.org/W2908878533,"Background There are major socio-economic gradients in health that could be influenced by increasing personal resources. Welfare rights advice can enhance resources but has not been rigorously evaluated for health-related impacts. Methods Randomised, wait-list controlled trial with individual allocation, stratified by general practice, of welfare rights advice and assistance with benefit entitlements, delivered in participants’ homes by trained advisors. Control was usual care. Participants were volunteers sampled from among all those aged ≥60 years registered with general practices in socio-economically deprived areas of north east England. Outcomes at 24 months were: CASP-19 score (primary), a measure of health-related quality of life; changes in income, social and physical function, and cost-effectiveness (secondary). Intention to treat analysis compared outcomes using multiple regression, with adjustment for stratification and key covariates. Qualitative interviews with purposive samples from both trial arms were thematically analysed. Findings Of 3912 individuals approached, 755 consented and were randomised (381 Intervention, 374 Control). Results refer to outcomes at 24 months, with data available on 562 (74.4%) participants. Intervention was received as intended by 335 (88%), with 84 (22%) awarded additional benefit entitlements; 46 did not receive any welfare rights advice, and none of these were awarded additional benefits. Mean CASP-19 scores were 42.9 (Intervention) and 42.4 (Control) (adjusted mean difference 0.3 [95%CI -0.8, 1.5]). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes except Intervention participants reported receiving more care at home at 24m (53.7 (Intervention) vs 42.0 (Control) hours/week (adjusted mean difference 26.3 [95%CIs 0.8, 56.1]). Exploratory analyses did not support an intervention effect and economic evaluation suggested the intervention was unlikely to be cost-effective. Qualitative data from 50 interviews suggested there were improvements in quality of life among those receiving additional benefits. Conclusions We found no effects on health outcomes; fewer participants than anticipated received additional benefit entitlements, and participants were more affluent than expected. Our findings do not support delivery of domiciliary welfare rights advice to achieve the health outcomes assessed in this population. However, better intervention targeting may reveal worthwhile health impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2910624020,"Background PPP1R3B has been suggested as a candidate gene for monogenic forms of diabetes as well as type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to its association with glycaemic trait and its biological role in glycogen synthesis. Objectives To study if rare missense variants in PPP1R3B increase the risk of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), T2D or affect measures of glucose metabolism. Method Targeted resequencing of PPP1R3B was performed in 8,710 samples; MODY patients with unknown etiology (n = 54), newly diagnosed patients with T2D (n = 2,930) and population-based control individuals (n = 5,726, of whom n = 4,569 had normal glucose tolerance). All population-based sampled individuals were examined using an oral glucose tolerance test. Results Among n = 396 carriers, we identified twenty-three PPP1R3B missense mutations, none of which segregated with MODY. The burden of likely deleterious PPP1R3B variants was significantly increased with a total of 17 carriers among patients with T2D (0.58% (95% CI: 0.36–0.93)) compared to 18 carriers among non-diabetic individuals (0.31% (95% CI: 0.20–0.49)), resulting in an increased risk of T2D (OR (95% CI) = 2.57 (1.14–5.79), p = 0.02 (age and sex adjusted)). Furthermore, carriers with diabetes had less abdominal fat and a higher serum concentration of LDL-cholesterol compared to patients with T2D without rare missense PPP1R3B variants. In addition, non-diabetic carriers had a higher birth weight compared to non-carriers. Conclusion Rare missense PPP1R3B variants may predispose to T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2910779662,"One explanation for the gender pay differences in labor markets is that women propose lower desired salaries. By using an actual job seeking resume database and applying text mining techniques, we are able to observe both the extent of gender differences in desired salaries and job-related self-view. We find gender differences in global self-view favoring females, and in some domain-specific self-view favoring males. Previous findings of disadvantaged groups having levels of self-view at least as high as those of advantaged groups lend credibility to our findings. Moreover, we argue that the differences in global self-view favoring females may be related to the theories of ""belief flipping"", since women in our sample of online-recruitment markets are distinct from the general population, with on average 15.2 years of education and 8.99 years of work experience, due to self-selection. In addition, we find that women do propose lower desired salary than men, after controlling for various factors such as human capital, marital status, industries. We further investigate the role of self-view and find it contributes to explain desired salaries, with modest mediator effect but little moderator effect on gender differences in desired salaries."
https://openalex.org/W2910779899,"Dengue being one of the deadliest diseases of tropical regions, enforces to put continuous efforts for the development of vaccine and effective therapeutics. Most of the antibodies generated during dengue infection are non-neutralizing and cause antibody dependent enhancement. Hence, making a potent neutralizing antibody against all four dengue serotypes could be very effective for the treatment. However, designing a single antibody for all serotypes is difficult due to variation in protein sequences. Therefore, the objective is to identify conserved region of dengue envelope protein and then develop an antibody against that conserved region. Before advancing to the development of such an antibody, it is desirable to validate the interactions between antibody and dengue envelope protein. In silico analysis of such interactions provides a good platform to find out a suitable region to design and construct an antibody against it by analyzing antigen-antibody interaction before synthesizing the antibody. In this study, two highly conserved regions of dengue envelope protein were identified and an scFv was constructed against it. Both scFv and FuBc proteins were expressed in bacterial expression system and binding efficiency was analyzed by SPR analysis with KD value 2.3 μM. In order to improve binding efficiency, an in silico scFv mutant library was created which was virtually screened for higher binding efficiency. Six mutants with high binding efficiency were selected for further analysis. The binding ability of these mutants were predicted using simulation analysis which shows these mutations were stabilizing scFv-FuBc complex."

We evaluated thrombus formation and early endothelialization after using abluminal biodegradable polymer-coated sirolimus- (BP-SES), and everolimus-eluting stents (BP-EES) versus a durable polymer-coated everolimus-eluting stent (DP-EES) in an in vivo setting. BP-SES, BP-EES, and DP-EES (n = 6 each) were implanted in coronary arteries of 12 mini-pigs that were then sacrificed after 7 and 10 days. Stents were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and a combined Verhoeff and Masson trichrome stain. Areas of fibrin deposition were digitally detected and measured with off-line morphometric software. Stents were investigated for re-endothelialization by transmission electron microscopy. At 7 days, histological analysis revealed the lowest area of fibrin deposition in BP-SES (BP-SES vs. BP-EES vs. DP-EES; 0.10 ± 0.06 mm2 vs. 0.15 ± 0.07 mm2 vs. 0.19 ± 0.06 mm2, p = 0.0004). At 10 days, the area of fibrin deposition was significantly greater in DP-EES (0.13 ± 0.04 mm2 vs. 0.14 ± 0.05 mm2 vs. 0.19 ± 0.08 mm2, p = 0.007). Endothelial cells in BP-SES demonstrated a significantly greater number of tight junctions than those in DP-EES according to by transmission electron microscopy for both days (p<0.05). Various parameters, including an inflammatory reaction and neointimal formation, were comparable among the groups at 7 and 10 days. An abluminal biodegradable polymer-coated SES showed the least fibrin deposition and greatest endothelial cell recovery at an early stage following implantation in the coronary arteries of mini-pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2910157234,"The last fifteen years have seen the emergence and overflow into the drug scene of “superpotent” N-benzylated phenethylamines belonging to the “NBOMe” series, accompanied by numerous research articles. Although N-benzyl substitution of 5-methoxytryptamine is known to increase its affinity and potency at 5-HT2 receptors associated with psychedelic activity, N-benzylated tryptamines have been studied much less than their phenethylamine analogs. To further our knowledge of the activity of N-benzyltryptamines, we have synthesized a family of tryptamine derivatives and, for comparison, a few 5-methoxytryptamine analogs with many different substitution patterns on the benzyl moiety, and subjected them to in vitro affinity and functional activity assays vs. the human 5-HT2 receptor subtypes. In the binding (radioligand displacement) studies some of these compounds exhibited only modest selectivity for either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors suggesting that a few of them, with affinities in the 10–100 nanomolar range for 5-HT2A receptors, might presumably be psychedelic. Unexpectedly, their functional (calcium mobilization) assays reflected very different trends. All of these compounds proved to be 5-HT2C receptor full agonists while most of them showed low efficacy at the 5-HT2A subtype. Furthermore, several showed moderate-to-strong preferences for activation of the 5-HT2C subtype at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, although some N-benzyltryptamines might be abuse-liable, others might represent new leads for the development of therapeutics for weight loss, erectile dysfunction, drug abuse, or schizophrenia."

(NICU). Furthermore, we investigated risk factors for potential colonization and molecular epidemiology of isolated resistant bacteria. This prospective study was conducted in the neonatal unit of Hassan II University Hospital of Fez from February 2013 to July 2015. During this period, all consecutive admitted neonates were screened for A. baumannii intestinal carriage, on admission and during the discharge process. Bacteriological and molecular tests were evaluated according to the international standards. This study examines the screening on admission of 455 newborns, 59% of whom were male. The average gestational age and birth weight were 35.2 weeks and 2612.1 g respectively. In total, 277 patients were included in the acquisition study on admission. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii strain carriage was 6.5%, while the acquisition rate during the hospital recovery was 13.7%. In this study, 68 MDR A. baumannii isolates were collected. The resistance rates to different antibiotic classes including, Ceftazidime, Gentamycin and Ciprofloxacin varied between 92 and 100%. Moreover, 13% of MDR A. baumannii isolates were carbapenemase producers and 88% harbored blaOXA-23 gene. On admission, three risk factors were significantly associated with A. baumannii colonization: age (OR, 2.803; IC95%, 1.191–6.596; P = 0.01), gender (OR, 0.382; IC95%, 0.158–0.921; P = 0.03) and the delivery birth at the Maternity of University Hospital (MUH), (OR, 0.196; IC95%, 0.071–0.540; P = 0.002). However during hospitalization, the only risk factor associated with acquisition of A. baumannii was the respiratory distress (OR, 2.270; IC95%, 1.055–4.881; P = 0.03). A high intestinal carriage rate of A. baumannii and multiple antibiotic resistance were found in our NICU. Thus, the spread of MDR A. baumannii should be monitored by an active surveillance strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2892990496,"Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) are widely distributed in bacteria, archaea, and microbial viruses, and bring about unparalleled levels of sequence variation in target proteins. While DGR variable proteins share low sequence identity, the structures of several such proteins have revealed the C-type lectin (CLec)-fold as a conserved scaffold for accommodating massive sequence variation. This conservation has led to the suggestion that the CLec-fold may be useful in molecular surface display applications. Thermostability is an attractive feature in such applications, and thus we studied the variable protein of a DGR encoded by a prophage of the thermophile Thermus aquaticus. We report here the 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the variable protein from the T. aquaticus DGR, called TaqVP, and confirm that it has a CLec-fold. Remarkably, its variable region is nearly identical in structure to those of several other CLec-fold DGR variable proteins despite low sequence identity among these. TaqVP was found to be thermostable, which appears to be a property shared by several CLec-fold DGR variable proteins. These results provide impetus for the pursuit of the DGR variable protein CLec-fold in molecular display applications."
https://openalex.org/W2908815350,"Our aim was to develop a widely available educational program in which students conducted authentic research that met the expectations of both the scientific and educational communities. This paper describes the development and implementation of a citizen science project based on DNA barcoding of reptile specimens obtained from the Museums Victoria frozen tissue collection. The student program was run by the Gene Technology Access Centre (GTAC) and was delivered as a “one day plus one lesson” format incorporating a one-day wet laboratory workshop followed by a single lesson at school utilising online bioinformatics tools. The project leveraged the complementary resources and expertise of the research and educational partners to generate robust scientific data that could be analysed with confidence, meet the requirements of the Victorian state education curriculum, and provide participating students with an enhanced learning experience. During two 1-week stints in 2013 and 2014, 406 students mentored by 44 postgraduate university students participated in the project. Students worked mainly in pairs to process ~200 tissue samples cut from 53 curated reptile specimens representing 17 species.

This ecological study investigated leprosy in rural communities and in wild armadillos from the Brazilian Amazon. The study area was the Mamiá Lake of Coari municipality, Amazonas State, Northern region, a hyper endemic leprosy area where residents live on subsistence farming, fishing and armadillo hunting and its meat intake are frequent. The leprosy survey was conducted in sixteen communities by a visiting team of specialists. Local partakers provided wild armadillos to investigate M. leprae infection. Volunteers had complete dermato-neurological examination by a dermatologist with expertise in leprosy diagnosis, suspect skin lesions were biopsied for histopathology (Hematoxylin-eosin/HE, Fite-Faraco/FF staining); slit skin smears were collected. Armadillos' tissue fragments (skins, spleens, livers, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, others) were prepared for histopathology (HE/FF) and for M. leprae repetitive element-RLEP-qPCR. Among 176 volunteers, six new indeterminate leprosy cases were identified (incidence = 3.4%). Suspect skin sections and slit skin smears were negative for bacilli. Twelve wild D. novemcinctus were investigated (48 specimens/96 slides) and histopathological features of M. leprae infection were not found, except for one skin presenting unspecific inflammatory infiltrate suggestive of indeterminate leprosy. Possible traumatic neuroma, granuloma with epithelioid and Langhans cells, foreign-body granuloma were also identified. Granulomatous/non-granulomatous dermatitides were periodic-acid-Schiff/PAS negative for fungus. M. leprae-RLEP-qPCR was negative in all armadillos' tissues; no bacillus was found in histopathology. Our survey in rural communities confirmed the high endemicity for leprosy while one armadillo was compatible with paucibacillary M. leprae infection. At least in the highly endemic rural area of Coari, in the Brazilian Amazon region where infectious sources from untreated multibacillary leprosy are abundant, M. leprae infected armadillos may not represent a major source of infection nor a significant public health concern."

https://openalex.org/W2910235260,"Saccadic adaptation is assumed to be driven by an unconscious and automatic mechanism. We wondered if the adaptation process is accessible to volitional control, specifically whether any change in saccade gain can be inhibited. Participants were exposed to post-saccadic error by using the double-step paradigm in which a target is presented in a peripheral location and then stepped during the saccade to another location. In one condition, participants were instructed to follow the target step and look at the final target location. In the other condition they were instructed to inhibit the adjustment of saccade amplitude and look at the initial target location. We conducted two experiments, which differed in the size of the intra-saccadic target step. We found that when told to inhibit amplitude adjustment, gain change was close to zero for outward steps, but some adaptation remained for inward steps. Saccadic latency was not affected by the instruction type for inward steps, but when the target was stepped outward, latencies were longer in the inhibition than in the adaptation condition. The results show that volitional control can be exerted on saccadic adaptation. We suggest that volitional control affects the remapping of the target, thus having a larger impact on outward adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2910354160,"Current policy in South Africa requires measurement of blood pressure at every visit in primary care. The number of patients regularly visiting primary care clinics for routine care is increasing rapidly, causing long queues, and unmanageable workloads.We used data collected during a randomised control trial in primary care clinics in South Africa to estimate how changes in policy might affect workloads and improve identification of undiagnosed hypertension.The prevalence of raised blood pressure increased with age; 65% of individuals aged over 60 years had a raised blood pressure, and 49% of them were not on any treatment. Over three months, eight health facilities saw 8,947 individual chronic disease patients, receiving 22,323 visits from them. Of these visits, 60% were related to hypertension, with or without HIV, and a further 35% were related to HIV alone. Long waits for blood pressure checks caused friction at all levels of the clinics. Blood pressure machines frequently broke down due to heavy use, and high blood pressures readings were often ignored. If chronic disease patients without a diagnosis of hypertension had their blood pressure checked only once a year, the number of checks would be reduced by more than 80%. Individuals with hypertension had a blood pressure check on average once every 7 weeks, but South African guidelines recommend that this should be done every 3 months at most.The numbers of chronic disease patients in primary care clinics in South Africa is rising rapidly. New policies for measuring blood pressure in these patients attending clinics are urgently needed.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN12128227 5th March 2014."
https://openalex.org/W2910687201,"Tattooing especially gains popularity among both men and women in adulthood from the wide range of socioeconomic groups and is noted as a risk taking behaviour in adults. Especially when tattooing does not perform to the highest standards, it can potentially be the hazardous practice. Myanmar has a paucity of evidence-based information on the estimated prevalence of tattoos and awareness of potential disease transmission from tattooing under insanitary conditions as well as the infection risk. The present research was undertaken to help identify the self-reported prevalence of tattooing among adults (18-35 years) and their knowledge of transmission risk of blood-borne infections and its determinants.A community-based cross-sectional study focused on residents aged 18-35 years was carried out in two urban and two rural areas in Mandalay district, Mandalay Region during 2015. Trained interviewers used a pre-tested structured questionnaire for face-to-face interviews with one eligible participant per selected household (n = 401). Bivariate analysis and multivariable analysis using binary logistic regression were done to ascertain the relevant explanatory variables.The overall self-reported prevalence of tattooing was 19.5% (78/401) (95% CI = 16-24). Nearly 80% of participants (318/401) knew at least one blood-borne viral infection that could be transmitted from tattooing. The persons who had high formal education, manual laborers and those who lived with their families were significantly more likely to cite at least one blood-borne viral infection. Their perceived possibility to remove tattoo independently influenced the practice of tattooing (aOR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.06-3.45; p = 0.03) compared with participants who reported no perceived possibility. Tattooing was more common in male (aOR = 13.07, 95% CI = 6.25-27.33; p<0.001) compared to female which was independently significant.This study ascertained the tattoo prevalence as two in ten adults of working age especially among male in central part of Myanmar in the context of lack of registration system for tattoo parlours and the issuance of safety guidelines. Findings have suggested the target groups and risk factors to be included in future health promotion programs. Future research directions should focus on perspectives of tattooists to create and sustain the sanitary practices to reduce the chance of transmission of blood-borne viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2910035075,"Background It has been suggested that patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) perform poorly in postural tasks when compared to healthy individuals. Despite its importance in posture and alignment of the trunk in relation to the head, neck proprioception has not been examined in patients with low back pain. The purpose of this study was to compare neck proprioception in patients with CNSLBP with healthy individuals. Methods Cervical joint reposition error was measured five times consecutively in the neutral head position, 30° and 60° left and right head rotation. The main outcome measure was the mean cervical joint repositioning error of the head. Results Forty-six participants with (n = 24, 54 ± 16yrs SD, 14 females) and without (n = 22, 36 ± 13yrs SD, 13 females) CNSLBP were included in the study. Comparison of mean cervical joint repositioning error between patients and healthy controls showed no statistically significant group difference in any of the applied positions. The range of deviation in CNSLBP patients was between 1.57° and 3.27° compared to 1.46° to 2.26° in healthy controls. An overshooting tendency for both groups was found in the neutral head position. Conclusion The ability to accurately position the head does not seem to be impaired in patients with CNSLBP. This may suggest that sensorimotor control is affected on other levels of the movement system and future research should focus on methods to identify the source of these aberrations."
https://openalex.org/W2910569358,"To examine the burden of out-of-pocket household expenditures and time spent on care by families responsible for children with Down Syndrome (DS).A cross-sectional analysis was performed after surveying families of children with DS. The children all received medical care at the Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gomez (HIMFG), a National Institute of Health. Data were collected on out-of-pocket household expenditures for the medical care of these children. The percentage of such expenditure was calculated in relation to available household expenditure (after subtracting the cost of food/housing), and the percentage of households with catastrophic expenditure. Finally, the time spent on the care of the child was assessed.The socioeconomic analysis showed that 67% of the households with children with DS who received medical care in the HIMFG were within the lower four deciles (I-IV) of expenses, indicating a limited ability to pay for medical services. Yearly out-of-pocket expenditures for a child with DS represented 27% of the available household expenditure, which is equivalent to $464 for the United States dollars (USD). On average, 33% of families with DS children had catastrophic expenses, and 46% of the families had to borrow money to pay for medical expenses. The percentage of catastrophic expenditure was greater for a household with children aged five or older compared with households with younger children. The regression analysis revealed that the age of the child is the most significant factor determining the time spent on care.Some Mexican families of children with DS incur substantial out-of-pocket expenditures, which constitute an economic burden for families of children who received medical care at the HIMFG."
https://openalex.org/W2908606926,"Codebook-based feature encodings are a standard framework for image recognition issues. A codebook is usually constructed by clusterings, such as the k-means and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A codebook size is an important factor to decide the trade-off between recognition performance and computational complexity and a traditional framework has the disadvantage to image recognition issues when a large codebook; the number of unique clusters becomes smaller than a designated codebook size because some clusters converge to close positions. This paper focusses on the disadvantage from a perspective of the distribution of prior probabilities and presents a clustering framework including two objectives that are alternated to the k-means and the GMM. Our approach is first evaluated with synthetic clustering datasets to analyze a difference to traditional clustering. In the experiment section, although our approach alternated to the k-means generates similar results to the k-means results, our approach is able to finely tune clusters for our objective. Our approach alternated to the GMM significantly improves our objective and constructs intuitively appropriate clusters, especially for huge and complicatedly distributed samples. In the experiment on image recognition issues, two state-of-the-art encodings, the Fisher Vector (FV) using the GMM and the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) using the k-means, are evaluated with two publicly available image datasets, the Birds and the Butterflies. For the results of the VLAD with our approach, the recognition performances tend to be worse compared to the original VLAD results. On the other hand, the FV using our approach is able to improve the performance, especially in a larger codebook size."
https://openalex.org/W2909970133,"Lexical embedding is common in all languages and elicits mutual orthographic interference between an embedded word and its carrier. The neural basis of such interference remains unknown. We employed a novel fMRI prime-target embedded word paradigm to test for involvement of a visual word form area (VWFA) in left ventral occipitotemporal cortex in co-activation of embedded words and their carriers. Based on the results of related fMRI studies we predicted either enhancement or suppression of fMRI responses to embedded words initially viewed as primes, and repeated in the context of target carrier words. Our results clearly showed enhancement of fMRI responses in the VWFA to embedded-carrier word pairs as compared to unrelated prime-target pairs. In contrast to non-visual language-related areas (e.g., left inferior frontal gyrus), enhanced fMRI responses did not occur in the VWFA when embedded-carrier word pairs were restricted to the left visual hemifield. Our finding of fMRI enhancement in the VWFA is novel evidence of its involvement in representational rivalry between orthographically similar words, and the co-activation of embedded words and their carriers."
