https://openalex.org/W1975712471,The yeast GAL4 protein (881 amino acids) binds to specific DNA sites upstream of target genes and activates transcription. Derivatives of this protein bearing as few as 74 amino terminal residues bind to these sites but fail to activate transcription. When appropriately positioned in front of a gene these derivatives act as repressors. These and related findings support the idea that GAL4 activates transcription by touching other DNA-bound proteins.
https://openalex.org/W1493910160,"Plasma kallikrein was found to be a good activator of pro-urokinase, the inactive zymogen form of urokinase. The complete activation of pro-urokinase by plasma kallikrein was obtained in 2 h with an enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1/30. The rate of activation of pro-urokinase by plasma kallikrein was comparable to that catalyzed by plasmin and trypsin. The rate of activation of pro-urokinase by factor XIIa was approximately one-seventh of that by plasma kallikrein. The activation of the zymogen was due to the cleavage of a single internal peptide bond, resulting in the conversion of a single chain pro-urokinase (Mr = 55,000) into two-chain urokinase (Mr = 33,000 and 22,000), and these two chains were linked by a disulfide bond(s). These results indicate an important role of plasma kallikrein for the activation of pro-urokinase in the factor XII-dependent intrinsic pathway of fibrinolysis. Thrombin also converted pro-urokinase to a two-chain form that was not activatable by plasmin, plasma kallikrein, and factor XIIa. Thrombin specifically cleaved the Arg 156-Phe 157 bond which is located 2 residues prior to the activation site of Lys 158-Ile 159."
https://openalex.org/W1533219519,"We conducted a systematic evaluation of the effects of increasing levels of dietary methionine on the metabolites and enzymes of methionine metabolism in rat liver. Significant decreases in hepatic concentrations of betaine and serine occurred when the dietary methionine was raised from 0.3 to 1.0%. We observed increased concentrations of S-adenosylhomocysteine in livers of rats fed 1.5% methionine and of S-adenosylmethionine and methionine only when the diet contained 3.0% methionine. Methionine supplementation resulted in decreased hepatic levels of methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase and increased levels of methionine adenosyltransferase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, and cystathionine synthase. We used these data to simulate the regulatory locus formed by the enzymes which metabolize homocysteine in livers of rats fed 0.3% methionine, 1.5% methionine, and 3.0% methionine. In comparison to the model for the 0.3% methionine diet group, the model for the 3.0% methionine animals demonstrates a 12-fold increase in the synthesis of cystathionine, a 150% increase in flow through the betaine reaction, and a 550% increase in total metabolism of homocysteine. The concentrations of substrates and other metabolites are significant determinants of this apparent adaptation."

We show that methylphenylpyridine (MPP+), an active metabolite of MPTP which is accumulated intraneuronally by the catecholamine uptake system, binds with high affinity to melanin and neuromelanin. MPP+ bound intracellularly to neuromelanin may be released gradually, resulting in subsequent damage to the neurons of the substantia nigra."
https://openalex.org/W1512070100,"Null point titration techniques have been developed for measurements of cytosolic free Mg2+ in isolated cells and matrix free Mg2+ in isolated mitochondria using antipyrylazo III as a spectrophotometric Mg2+ indicator. A cytosolic free Mg2+ of 0.37 +/- 0.02 mM was obtained with hepatocytes. This represented about 6% of the total cytosolic magnesium content (activity coefficient of 5.8 X 10(-2). Nondiffusable Mg2+-binding sites in the cytosol were equal to 11.1 nmol/mg cell dry weight with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.71 mM and accounted for binding of 32% of the cytosolic magnesium. The null point method gave a value of 0.35 +/- 0.01 mM for the mitochondrial matrix free Mg2+ concentration (activity coefficient of 8.8 X 10(-3). Nondiffusable Mg2+ binding sites in the mitochondria were estimated at 25.7 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.22 mM, compared with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.66 microM for bound calcium. These data demonstrate the absence of a significant gradient of free Mg2+ between the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. They also demonstrate a high ligand binding capacity for magnesium in both compartments with relatively low affinity resulting in a constant value for free Mg2+ when total cell magnesium is constant. This maintains a ratio between free Mg2+ and free Ca2+ of about 2000 in the cytosol and 100 in the mitochondria. The high concentration and low affinity of Mg2+ binding sites results in rather large changes of free Mg2+ with small variations in total cell magnesium. This is apparent in hepatocytes isolated from streptozotocin diabetic rats which had a decreased total magnesium content and a cytosolic free Mg2+ of 0.16 +/- 0.02 mM."
https://openalex.org/W1597762117,"In previous studies in intact 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation state of an acidic, multicomponent Mr 80,000 protein appeared to be a specific and useful marker for the activation state of protein kinase C (Blackshear, P.J., Witters, L.A., Girard, P.R., Kuo, J.F., and Quamo, S.N. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13304-13315). In the present studies, we demonstrate that the Mr 80,000 protein from rat adipose tissue was a substrate for protein kinase C in vitro, and co-migrated on two-dimensional gels with the analogous protein from murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes labeled by exposure of intact cells to 32Pi and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Partial proteolytic maps of the two 32P-proteins were nearly identical, supporting the postulate that the sites phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro, and in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in vivo, were similar or identical. Despite their similar apparent molecular weights, we were able to distinguish between the Mr 80,000 protein and protein kinase C by several physical criteria. The Mr 80,000 protein kinase C substrate was found in fractions of all rat tissues examined, but was most prominent in rat brain. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulated phosphorylation of the Mr 80,000 protein in several types of cultured neuronal cells, suggesting a possible role for this protein in cholinergic neurotransmission. The Mr 80,000 protein appears to be a useful marker for protein kinase C activation in a variety of cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2098706903,"The addition of platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor to quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts rapidly induced protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization and afterwards markedly increased c-myc mRNA levels. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, a membrane-permeable synthetic diacylglycerol, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, a tumor-promoting phorbol ester, stimulated protein kinase C activation without Ca2+ mobilization. Inversely, Ca2+ ionophores, A23187 and ionomycin, elicited Ca2+ mobilization without protein kinase C activation. Both protein kinase C-activating and Ca2+-mobilizing agents were able to increase c-myc mRNA levels in an additive manner. Prolonged treatment of the cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, another protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, led to the down-regulation and complete disappearance of protein kinase C. In these cells, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate did not increase c-myc mRNA levels, but platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and the Ca2+ ionophores, all of which still induced Ca2+ mobilization, stimulated the increase of c-myc mRNA levels. These results strongly suggest that both protein kinase C and Ca2+ may be involved in platelet-derived growth factor- as well as fibroblast growth factor-induced expression of the c-myc oncogene in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1558585768,"The catalytic moiety of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase has been purified from bovine brain. It is isolated largely without its guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein, Gs, by affinity chromatography on 7-O-hemisuccinyldeacetylforskolin-agarose. It appears to be a single polypeptide which migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent Mr of approximately 120,000. When subjected to electrophoresis on gradient (5-10%) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, it displays a larger apparent Mr of 150,000. The adenylate cyclase activity of the preparation can be stimulated by the addition of Gs, forskolin, or calcium-calmodulin. The preparation has been reconstituted with purified beta-adrenergic receptors and Gs to form a hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase system (May, D., Ross, E.M., Gilman, A.G., and Smigel, M.D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15829-15833). In contrast to its stimulation by Gs, inhibition by the alpha subunits of Gi and Go, G proteins known to be coupled to inhibitory receptors (Sternweis, P., and Florio, V. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3477-3483), is not seen. Preparations of adenylate cyclase show varying degrees of inhibition by added G protein beta . gamma subunit. This inhibition can be explained as reflecting a variable, small (under 5%) contamination of the preparation by Gs alpha which would be deactivated by complexing with the added beta . gamma subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2034019749,"Transcripts encoded by six of the homeotic lethal complementation groups within the Antennapedia and bithorax gene complexes (ANT-C and BX-C) accumulate primarily in nonoverlapping regions of the embryonic central nervous system (CNS). It has been previously proposed that the maintenance of these selective patterns of expression involve hierarchical cross-regulatory interactions among ANT-C and BX-C loci. Selective expression of the ANT-C and BX-C also involves regulation by a number of unlinked genetic loci, including the Polycomb (Pc) locus. Here we show that the ANT-C and BX-C transcript distribution patterns are dramatically altered in the CNS of Pc- embryos. We discuss these altered patterns of expression in the context of different models for the spatial regulation of ANT-C and BX-C gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1554938621,"We have purified from rat peritoneal exudates a 37-kDa protein that inhibits phospholipase A2 activity. It is the predominant phospholipase inhibitor protein in these preparations and also is detected in a wide variety of cell lines. Levels of expression range from 0 to 0.5% of total protein. In the peritoneal preparations, the inhibitor is partially proteolyzed into a series of lower mass forms, including species at 30, 24, and 15 kDa. These fragments all are immunoreactive with an antibody raised against the 37-kDa protein. The rat protein also is immunoreactive with an antibody developed against a 6-kDa phospholipase inhibitor protein from snake venom. The primary structure of more than half of the rat inhibitor has been deduced by protein microsequence analysis. These sequences are closely related to sequences from its human analogue, which we recently cloned and expressed (Wallner, B. P., Mattaliano, R. J., Hession, C., Cate, R. L., Tizard, R., Sinclair, L. K., Foeller, C., Chow, E. P., Browning, J. L., Ramachandran, K. L., and Pepinsky, R. B. (1986) Nature, in press), and thus we infer that the inhibitor is highly conserved evolutionarily. Properties of the molecule suggest that it is a member of a family of steroid-induced anti-inflammatory proteins collectively referred to as lipocortin."
https://openalex.org/W1557594417,"The de novo biosynthesis of sphinganine and sphingosine was studied using LM cells incubated with [14C] serine in serum-free media. Most of the radiolabeled long-chain bases were initially found in dihydroceramides (as sphinganine) and the proportion appearing in complex sphingolipids (as sphingosine) increased over time. Since free long-chain bases were not detected (although formation of 3-ketosphinganine, the first condensation product of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, could be demonstrated in vitro), it appears that the first step is rate-limiting for dihydroceramide biosynthesis. The kinetics suggested that after N-acyl-sphinganines were formed they were dehydrogenated to N-acylsphingosines. No evidence was found for the formation in vivo or in vitro of the putative intermediates of the direct biosynthesis of sphingosine from sphinganine (i.e. 3-ketosphingosine and free sphingosine). The conversion of N-acylsphinganines to N-acyl-sphingosines was confirmed by incubating cells with [14C] serine followed by unlabeled serine, which resulted in a rapid increase in the sphingosine-to-sphinganine ratio in amide-linked sphingolipids during the chase. These findings are most consistent with a pathway for long-chain base biosynthesis in which N-acyl-sphinganines are first synthesized by LM cells and the 4-trans-double bond is added to this or subsequent products, as opposed to the most cited pathway wherein sphingosine is made directly from sphinganine."
https://openalex.org/W1601839528,"The Ca2+ accumulating properties of a nonmitochondrial intracellular organelle within cultured N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells containing an (ATP + Mg2+)-dependent Ca2+ pump were recently described in detail (Gill, D. L., and Chueh, S. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9289-9297). Using both saponin-permeabilized N1E-115 cells and microsomal membranes from cells, this report describes the effectiveness of both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and guanine nucleotides in mediating Ca2+ release from this internal organelle, believed to be endoplasmic reticulum. Using permeabilized N1E-115 cells, 2 microM IP3 effects rapid release (t1/2 less than 20 s) of approximately 40% of accumulated Ca2+ releasable with 5 microM A23187. Half-maximal Ca2+ release occurs with 0.5 microM IP3, and maximal release with 3 microM IP3. Using a frozen microsomal membrane fraction isolated from lysed cells, 2 microM IP3 rapidly releases (t1/2 less than 30 s) 10-20% of A23187-releasable Ca2+ accumulated within nonmitochondrial Ca2+-pumping vesicles, although only in the presence of 3% polyethylene glycol (PEG). 10 microM GTP, but not guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (GMPPNP), increases the extent of release in the presence of IP3. Importantly, however, GTP alone induces a substantial release of Ca2+ (up to 40% of releasable Ca2+) with a t1/2 value (60-90 s) slightly longer than that for IP3. The effects of IP3 and GTP are approximately additive, and both effects require 3% PEG. Half-maximal Ca2+ release occurs with 1 microM GTP, with maximal release at 3-5 microM GTP; 20 microM GMPPNP has no effect on release and only slightly inhibits 5 microM GTP; 20 microM GDP promotes full release, but only after a 90-s lag, and initially inhibits the action of 5 microM GTP. Using permeabilized N1E-115 cells, 5 microM GTP with 3% PEG releases greater than 50% of releasable Ca2+; without PEG, GTP still mediates approximately 30% release of Ca2+ from cells. Neither IP3, GTP, or both together (with or without PEG) effects release of Ca2+ accumulated within synaptic plasma membrane vesicles. The profound effectiveness of GTP on Ca2+ release has important implications for intracellular Ca2+ regulation and is probably related to Ca2+ release mediated by IP3."
https://openalex.org/W2017371535,"Expression plasmids containing the E. coli lacZ coding region preceded by a set of different ribosome-binding sites and put under transcriptional control of the leftward promoter of phage lambda (PL) were used to study the synthesis of lacZ mRNA. In a normal host the steady state level of full-length lacZ mRNA varied 100-fold with the different synthesis levels of beta-galactosidase, whereas in a host expressing the antitermination protein N of phage lambda, all vectors synthesized the same amount of full-length lacZ mRNA, while maintaining the differences in beta-galactosidase expression. We present evidence for a causal relationship between the rate of ribosome loading and the continuation of transcription across the lacZ gene. We suggest that extended spacing between the RNA polymerase and the elongating ribosome causes transcriptional polarity by increasing the extent of premature termination. The conditional character of the termination event can best be explained by invoking termination factor Rho."
https://openalex.org/W1508890797,"Antithrombin III Basel is a hereditary abnormal antithrombin with normal progressive inhibition activity (normal reactive site) and reduced heparin cofactor activity (impaired heparin binding site). Structures of antithrombin III Basel and normal antithrombin III isolated from the same patient were compared by peptide mapping using the dimethylaminoazobenzene isothiocyanate precolumn derivatization technique. Of the approximately 50 tryptic peptides of normal and abnormal antithrombin III, one peptide comprising residues 40-46 had a different retention time in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the peptide from antithrombin III Basel had a single substitution of Pro (normal) by Leu (abnormal) at position 41. This substitution is close to an Arg (residue 47) and a Trp (residue 49) which have previously been shown to be critical for heparin binding by antithrombin III. Although additional amino acid substitutions in antithrombin III Basel cannot be ruled out, this Pro-Leu replacement could cause a conformational change by increasing both the helical structure and the hydrophobicity around residue 41. These data suggest that: (i) the heparin binding site of antithrombin III encompasses the region containing residues 41, 47, and 49; and (ii) the impaired heparin cofactor activity of antithrombin III Basel is likely due to a conformational change of the heparin binding site induced by the Pro-Leu substitution at position 41."
https://openalex.org/W1997208313,"We have used the chemical cleavage reagent methidiumpropyl-EDTA-Fe(II) to determine the location of the nucleosomes along the mouse β-major globin gene in erythroid and nonerythroid cells. In mouse L cells, in which the globin gene is inactive, the nucleosomes are precisely positioned with respect to the underlying DNA sequence from positions −3000 to +1500 relative to the cap site. In uninduced and induced murine erythroleukemia cells, the same phasing persists but is interrupted from positions −200 to +500. This gap in the phased distribution of nucleosomes appears to be protected from MPE-Fe(II) digestion, and is bounded on both sides by hypersensitive sites. These results define at least two structural states for the globin gene: an inactive state in which the gene is covered with a continuous array of phased nucleosomes and an active state in which this array is disrupted over the 5′ half of the structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W1589250168,"The oxidation of linoleic acid catalyzed by soybean lipoxygenase isozymes was accompanied by 1268 nm chemiluminescence characteristic of singlet oxygen. The recombination of peroxy radicals as first proposed by Russell (Russell, G.A. (1957) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79, 3871-3877) is a plausible mechanism for the observed singlet oxygen production. Lipoxygenase-3 was the most active isozyme. Under the optimal aerobic conditions of p2H 7, 100 micrograms/ml lipoxygenase-3, 100 microM linoleic acid, 100 microM 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid, and air-saturated buffer, the yield of singlet oxygen was 12 +/- 0.4 microM or 12% of the amount predicted by the Russell mechanism. High yields of singlet oxygen required the presence of 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid. Systems containing lipoxygenase-2 and lipoxygenase-3 produced comparable yields of singlet oxygen without added 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid, since the lipoxygenase-2 served as an in situ source of hydroperoxide. Lipoxygenase-1 was active only at low oxygen concentrations. Its singlet oxygen-producing capacity was greatly increased by the addition of acetone to the system. Lipoxygenase-2 did not produce detectable quantities of singlet oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1555592162,"Bovine cerebral cortex contains two major substrates for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin: a 39-kDa protein, alpha 39, and a 41-kDa protein, alpha 41 (Neer, E. J., Lok, J. M., and Wolf, L. G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14222-14229). Both of these proteins bind guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) with a similar affinity (Kd = 30 +/- 10 nM for alpha 39, Kd = 32 +/- 14 nM for alpha 41). Both proteins associate with a beta X gamma subunit made up of a 36-kDa beta component and a 6-kDa gamma component. We have previously shown that the beta X gamma unit is required for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (Neer et al. (1984)). By measuring the amount of beta X gamma required for maximal incorporation of ADP-ribose, we now find that the EC50 for beta X gamma in this reaction is 3 +/- 1 times lower for alpha 41 than for alpha 39. ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin does not prevent dissociation of alpha 41 X beta X gamma or alpha 39 X beta X gamma by GTP gamma S. GTP gamma S decreases the sedimentation coefficient of ADP-ribosylated alpha 41 from 4.2 S to 3.0 S and the sedimentation coefficient of ADP-ribosylated alpha 39 from 4.3 S to 2.9 S. The conclusion that GTP gamma S dissociates both ADP-ribosylated heterotrimers was confirmed by the observation that GTP gamma S blocks precipitation of ADP-ribosylated alpha 39 or alpha 41 by anti-beta antibody. Neither alpha 41 X beta X gamma nor alpha 39 X beta X gamma is dissociated by GTP whether or not the proteins are ADP-ribosylated. The observation that alpha 41 more readily associates with beta X gamma than does alpha 39 may explain our earlier observation that alpha 41 is more readily ADP-ribosylated than alpha 39. In most intact membranes, only a 41-kDa ADP-ribosylated protein is seen. However, alpha 39 is also present in most tissues since we can detect it with anti-alpha 39 antibody. The functional consequences of pertussis toxin treatment may depend on whether one or both proteins are ADP-ribosylated. This in turn may depend on the ratio of alpha 41 and alpha 39 to beta X gamma in a given tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1488144850,"The P, H, and T proteins of the glycine cleavage system have been purified separately from pea leaf mitochondria and demonstrate molecular weights of 98,000, 15,500, and 45,000, respectively, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of P protein by gel filtration was 210,000, indicating that this enzyme has a native homodimer conformation. Reconstitution assays containing purified P, H, and T proteins and yeast lipoamide dehydrogenase catalyze the oxidation of glycine and demonstrate a strict dependence on pyridoxal phosphate, tetrahydrofolate, NAD+, and dithiothreitol. The released CO2, methylamine-H protein intermediate, and methylenetetrahydrofolate are produced in stoichiometric amounts from glycine during the cleavage reaction. H protein acts as co-substrate with glycine during the decarboxylation reaction, demonstrating an apparent Km value of 2.2 microM. P and H protein alone jointly catalyze the glycine carboxyl-14 CO2 exchange reaction in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate and dithiothreitol. L protein of the glycine cleavage system was immunopurified using monoclonal antibodies. Antigenic and molecular weight similarities of the L protein with the lipoamide dehydrogenase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were shown suggesting the possibility of common isomers of lipoamide dehydrogenase for the two enzyme complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1497178009,"Urokinase-related proteins were purified from 60-liter batches of human urine collected into the protease inhibitor aprotinin to prevent proteolytic degradation. Three homogeneous species were obtained by chromatography on zinc chelate-Sepharose, SP-Sephadex C-50, Sephadex G-100, benzamidine-Sepharose, and immunoadsorption on a murine anti-human urokinase monoclonal antibody. One urokinase-related protein with Mr 95,000 representing a complex of two-chain urokinase with an inhibitor accounts for about 70% of the total urokinase-related antigen in urine. Nucleophilic agents dissociate the complex into active two-chain urokinase and a protein with Mr 45,000-50,000 which is immunologically distinct from urokinase. Approximately 25% of the urinary urokinase-related antigen represents a molecule with Mr 54,000. This highly purified molecule was obtained with a yield of 5 micrograms/liter of urine. Only trace amounts (less than 5%) of the urokinase-related antigen were recovered as free two-chain urokinase. The urinary urokinase-related protein has no specific affinity for fibrin. It has a very low activity on Pyroglu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, a urokinase-specific synthetic substrate, but directly activates plasminogen following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km = 0.7 microM and kcat = 0.0011 S-1. The molecule is rapidly converted to active two-chain urokinase by plasmin. Active two-chain urinary urokinase has a very high amidolytic activity and activates plasminogen with Km = 60 microM and kcat = 1.4 S-1. It is concluded that the urokinase-related proteins in human urine consist of about 25% of urokinase (10-20 micrograms/liter) and of about 75% two-chain urokinase (40-50 micrograms/liter), the bulk of which is complexed to an inhibitor. Because even in freshly voided urine most of the urokinase-related antigen is already converted to two-chain urokinase, urine does not seem to be a suitable source for the large-scale purification of urokinase. In view of the very significant intrinsic plasminogen-activating properties of urokinase, it should not be considered to be a proenzyme form of urokinase. The dramatic differences of its kinetic constants from those of urokinase render the designation urokinase equally inadequate. Consequently, the designation single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator was recently adopted by the International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA, July 13-14, 1985)."
https://openalex.org/W1493072758,"A urokinase-type plasminogen activator was purified from conditioned media of several human cell cultures, but preferably from the human lung adenocarcinoma line CALU-3 (ATCC, HTB-55), using a combination of chromatography on zinc chelate-Sepharose, SP-Sephadex C-50, and Sephadex G-100. Final yields of 65-100 micrograms/liter of starting material were obtained with a 290-fold purification factor and a recovery of 30%. The purified plasminogen activator consists of a single polypeptide chain with Mr 54,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is very similar or identical to single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator on the basis of immunodiffusion, amino acid composition, and the lack of specific binding to fibrin. It has very low amidolytic activity on Pyroglu-Gly-Arg-rho-nitroanilide and is converted to two-chain urokinase by limited exposure to plasmin. It has a specific activity of 60,000 IU/mg on fibrin plates and directly activates plasminogen following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km = 1.1 microM and kappa cat = 0.0026 S-1. It is concluded that the plasminogen activator purified from CALU-3-conditioned media is physically and kinetically identical to single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator. With the present straightforward purification method and a readily available source, sufficient amounts of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator can be obtained for more detailed investigations of its biochemical, biological, and thrombolytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1559334659,"The mobilization of internally sequestered stores of Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C appear to be involved in neutrophil activation. We have examined the inter-relationship of these two pathways by investigating the effects of modulating Ca2+ activity on the binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) to protein kinase C in intact phagocytes. Differentiated HL-60 cells were equilibrated with [3H]PDBU prior to stimulation with various agents known to alter Ca2+ homeostasis in cells. Agents that elevated cytosolic Ca2+, such as f-Met-Leu-Phe and A23187, up-regulated radioligand binding by increasing the affinity of the PDBU/protein kinase C interaction. These effects were time- and agonist concentration-dependent and temperature-sensitive. The kinetics of the up-regulation of binding by f-Met-Leu-Phe coincided with the kinetics of Ca2+ mobilization (by quin2 fluorescence measurements). The putative intracellular Ca2+ antagonist 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate alone down-regulated [3H]PDBU binding and inhibited the up-regulation of ligand binding by f-Met-Leu-Phe and A23187. Low concentrations of La3+ (0.1-10 microM) also inhibited up-regulation of radioligand binding to f-Met-Leu-Phe and A23187, whereas higher concentrations (0.1-1 mM) alone increased [3H] PDBU binding and supported further up-regulation of ligand binding by the Ca2+-mobilizing agents. These data suggest a role for Ca2+ in the regulation of phorbol diester binding to protein kinase C in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515684470,"Calf (2-3-month-old) and steer (approximately 18-month-old) bovine articular chondrocytes were isolated and cultured as high density monolayers. The proteoglycans synthesized on day 5 during a 15-h period of labeling with [35S]sulfate or [3H]glucosamine were isolated and characterized. The majority (greater than 70%) of the newly synthesized proteoglycans were found in the medium. When viewed in the electron microscope, medium-derived proteoglycans of high buoyant density were longer in calf than in steer. The medium and extracts of the cell layer were pooled and the radiolabeled proteoglycans were fractionated by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation performed under dissociative conditions. The low buoyant density fraction contained, in both calf and steer, small-sized nonaggregating proteoglycans containing chondroitin sulfate. The high buoyant density fraction contained greater than 90% of the newly synthesized proteoglycans. The majority were able to interact with hyaluronic acid to form aggregates. Calf high buoyant density fraction proteoglycans were larger, had longer chondroitin sulfate chains and lower ratios of keratan sulfate chains/chondroitin sulfate chains than steer high buoyant density fraction proteoglycans. These maturation-related differences are typical of those present in the proteoglycans of the calf and steer cartilage matrix from which the chondrocytes were isolated. Experiments with beta-D-xylosides showed that steer cultures had the capacity to synthesize twice as many chondroitin sulfate chains/cell as calf cultures. At each xyloside concentration used, chondroitin sulfate chains were longer in calf than steer. At both ages, chain size decreased with increase in rate of synthesis; the relationship between chain size and rate of synthesis was, however, quite different at the two ages. The results of these studies suggest that articular chondrocytes have an inherent program that determines the quality of proteoglycans synthesized at different ages."
https://openalex.org/W1997631735,"Several molecular theories of aging postulate that there are age-dependent changes in gene expression and that these changes contribute to the reduction in the viability of senescent cells. High-resolution, semiautomated, quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of many soluble proteins was used to test this hypothesis in Drosophila. Two-dimensional protein gel patterns were analyzed for each of three age groups of [(35)S]methionine-labeled adult male Drosophila melanogaster, which, except for their spermatocytes, consist entirely of fixed postmitotic cells. Seven relatively abundant polypeptides expressed in middle-aged (28-day-old) flies were absent in both young(10-day-old) and old (44-day-old) flies. Quantitative analyses of an additional 100 polypeptides were carried out by computer-assisted microdensitometry of fluorograms of the gel preparations. These analyses revealed a significant age-related heterogeneity in the quantitative distribution of radiolabel in these proteins. The data indicate that the qualitative pattern of gene expression is identical in young and old flies, but that profound quantitative changes occur in the expression of proteins during the Drosophila life-span."

The two chains were separated by means of zinc chelate-agarose, which was found to bind the light chain selectively. The light chain was fully active on the tripeptide substrate H-D-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide (S-2288) and partially active on plasminogen. The plasminogen activator activity of the light chain was, in contrast to that of two-chain t-PA, not stimulated by fibrin or fibrinogen fragments. Fibrin-agarose chromatography of radiolabeled chains showed that only the heavy chain bound to fibrin. These results indicate that the active site-containing light chain in t-PA needs the heavy chain for fibrin stimulation of its plasminogen activator activity."

Type VIII was purified in the presence of protease inhibitors and at neutral pH by ultrafiltration, precipitation with 3.9 M NaCl, sedimentation in sucrose gradients, and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The major components of this collagen, VIII-1, -2, and -3, exhibited apparent molecular weights of greater than 194,000, 124,000, and 61,000, respectively, and were shown to contain identical CNBr peptides. Following separation of VIII-1, -2, and -3 from each other and any residual proteases by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, exposure to acetic acid led to the conversion of VIII-1 to VIII-2 and VIII-3. Thus, VIII-1 is not a continuous single peptide chain, and the preliminary interrupted-helix model of the type VIII structure (Benya, P. D. (1980) Renal Physiol. 3, 30-35) was revised. VIII-3 appears to be the parent alpha 1 (VIII)-chain, with VIII-2 and VIII-1 representing beta- and gamma-chain configurations stabilized by strong noncovalent acid-labile interactions and beta-aminoproprionitrile-insensitive covalent cross-links. Based on two-dimensional CNBr peptide mapping, the alpha-chain is composed of six peptides. Mr 5,300-19,600. The terminal peptides are pepsin sensitive and correlate with two noncollagenous domains, NC1 (Mr 14,700) and NC2 (Mr 4-5,000). NC1 contains the site of acid-labile chain association."
https://openalex.org/W1533151764,"Treatment of tobacco liquid suspension cultures with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, resulted in a dramatic overproduction of a 35-kDa peptide on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Malmberg, R.L., and McIndoo, J. (1983) Nature 305, 623-625). MGBG treatment also resulted in a 20-fold increase in the activity of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. Purification of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase from MGBG-treated cultures revealed that the overproduced 35-kDa peptide and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase are identical. Precursor incorporation experiments using [3H] methionine and [35S]methionine revealed that MGBG does not induce any increased synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase but rather stabilizes the protein to proteolytic degradation. The half-life of the enzyme activity was increased when MGBG was present in the growth medium. In addition to stabilizing S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, MGBG also resulted in the rapid and specific loss of arginine decarboxylase activity with little effect ornithine decarboxylase. The kinetics of this effect suggest that arginine decarboxylase synthesis was rapidly inhibited by MGBG. Exogenously added polyamines had little effect on ornithine decarboxylase, whereas S-adenosylmethionine and arginine decarboxylase activities rapidly diminished with added spermidine or spermine. Finally, inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase was lethal to the cultures, whereas inhibition of arginine decarboxylase was only lethal during initiation of growth in suspension culture."
https://openalex.org/W1490953839,"To investigate the chromatin surrounding an active gene, we have determined the distribution of RNA polymerase molecules, the intactness of nucleosomal structure, and the subnuclear compartmentalization along 15 kilobase pairs (kb) of the mouse kappa immunoglobulin locus of MPC-11 plasmacytoma cells. Hybridization of in vitro nuclear transcripts to probes specific for the template strand reveals that transcription terminates within the region between 1.1 and 2.3 kb downstream from the poly(A) addition site. Ten different short sequences (8-13 base pairs) reside within 460 base pairs of this termination region that exhibit homology with sequences found in the termination regions of mouse beta-globin and chicken ovalbumin genes. Transcription of the nontemplate strand occurs on either side of this termination region. We find that both within the transcription unit and 6.5 kb downstream of the termination region of the kappa gene, the canonical nucleosomal structure is perturbed, the chromatin exhibits pronounced insolubility, and the nucleosomes liberated by micrococcal nuclease appear to lack histone H1. The insolubility is characterized by interactions that are disrupted by 0.3 to 0.6 M NaCl treatment. We conclude that the active chromatin phenotype spreads a considerable distance along the kappa locus, well beyond the region of transcription termination."

https://openalex.org/W1572723753,"An enzyme from Clostridium thermoaceticum has been isolated which reduces disulfides of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and it has been named CO dehydrogenase disulfide reductase. The enzyme is a tetramer of molecular weight 225,000 made up of four apparently identical monomers. It does not contain methionine or tryptophan and contains 2 calcium and 1 zinc/monomer. NADP or ferredoxin serves as an electron carrier. This enzyme is part of the system that permits certain bacteria to grow with CO or CO2 and H2 as the source of carbon and energy. The portion of the pathway which is being investigated is the conversion of methyltetrahydrofolate, CO, and CoASH to acetyl-CoA. All the enzymes required for this synthesis have now been purified. In combination with CO dehydrogenase, CO dehydrogenase disulfide reductase with NADP or ferredoxin catalyzes a reversible exchange of [3H]CoASH with acetyl-CoA. The disulfide reductase apparently is involved in the portion of the pathway in which CoASH is introduced into the acetyl-CoA. In addition, the reductase activates CO dehydrogenase in the overall synthesis of acetyl-CoA from methyltetrahydrofolate, CO, and CoASH by reducing about one disulfide group/monomer of the alpha 3 beta 3 CO dehydrogenase. The above exchange reaction in combination with the observation that [14C]acetate is formed from CO and the 14CH3-[Co]corrinoid enzyme in the absence of CoASH have permitted ordering of the sequence of reactions by which CO dehydrogenase plays a central role in the autotrophic synthesis of acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1600378856,"Monoclonal antibodies were raised against arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase using a partially purified enzyme from porcine leukocytes as an antigen. Immunohistochemical studies indicated a selective localization of 12-lipoxygenase in the cytosol of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Two separate species of antibody (lox-1 and lox-2) recognizing different sites of the enzyme protein were utilized to develop a method to determine the amount of 12-lipoxygenase protein rather than the activity of enzyme. Fab fragment of lox-2 was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the conjugate as a label was bound to 12-lipoxygenase. The complex was precipitated with the aid of the other antibody (lox-1) and protein A, and the peroxidase activity in the precipitate was correlated with the amount of 12-lipoxygenase. The immunoenzymometry of 12-lipoxygenase was more convenient and sensitive than the conventional assay to determine the conversion of [1-14C]arachidonic acid. Furthermore, in several porcine tissues this method allowed quantitation of the enzyme, the activity of which was masked due to the presence of certain endogenous inhibitors. A ubiquitous distribution of 12-lipoxygenase in porcine tissues was demonstrated by application of this method."
https://openalex.org/W1519767585,"Calf thymus poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase (Mr = 120,000) is cleaved with papain into two fragments of M(r) = 74,000 and 46,000 and also split with chymotrypsin into two fragments of M(r) = 66,000 and 54,000. Each fragment purified to homogeneity is enzymatically inactive, but combined incubation of the 74,000 and 46,000 fragments in the presence of DNA restored 20% of the enzyme activity. In contrast, combined incubation of the 66,000 and 54,000 fragments does not restore any enzyme activity. In the former incubation, autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction occurs exclusively on the 74,000 fragment. When each fragment is incubated with [adenine-U-14C]NAD in the presence of DNA and a catalytic amount of the native enzyme, poly(ADP-ribosyl)action occurs in the overlapped portion (22,000) of the 66,000 fragment and the 74,000 fragment. Nevertheless, the purified 22,000 fragment is a poor acceptor for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The degree of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the proteolytic fragments is significantly reduced by increasing NaCl concentration, probably due to the lack of the interaction between the enzyme fragments and DNA. These results, taken together, indicate that DNA is indispensable for the reconstitution of the catalytic activity as well as the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the fragmented enzyme."

The intracellular rate of the enzyme in human erythrocytes was estimated from the rate at which the cells generated 14CO2 from 14C-labeled glucose in the presence of different amounts of methylene blue. This investigation differed from earlier studies in that: (a) accumulations of 6-phosphogluconate were considered in calculations of rate and (b) the cells were suspended in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, which is the buffer system for erythrocytes in vivo. As with earlier studies, however, the intracellular enzyme was under unexplained inhibition or restraint relative to kinetic properties of the purified enzyme. Also, the intracellular enzyme exhibited sigmoid kinetics. In contrast, the isolated enzyme has been found to exhibit classical kinetics. In the course of dilution/ultrafiltration of the hemolysate a possible cause for the reduced activity of the enzyme was found: most of the NADP was bound to soluble macromolecules of the erythrocyte. The amount of NADP available to the enzyme was much less than the amount indicated by measurements of total (bound and unbound) NADP."
https://openalex.org/W1558070705,"The steroid binding specificity of cytochrome P-450scc has been investigated for different oxidation/reduction and ligand-binding states of the enzyme (oxidized, reduced, oxygen-bound, and carbon monoxide-bound forms). The oxygen of the 3 beta-hydroxyl of cholesterol is important for the initial enzyme-substrate interaction. Significant binding requires the correct stereochemistry and appears to be controlled by the electron density on the 3 beta-oxygen. Interactions at this position (located at least 13 A from the heme iron) can modulate the heme midpoint potential. The binding site in this region contains a cleft which can accommodate up to two carbons joined in an ether linkage to the 3 beta-oxygen. The steroid intermediates of side chain cleavage (22R-hydroxycholesterol and 20 alpha,22R-dihydroxycholesterol) bind more tightly to the ferric enzyme than does cholesterol and utilize specific interactions of these side chain hydroxyls with a grouping(s) on the polypeptide chain (i.e. not with the heme iron). The interaction requires the correct stereochemistry; a 22S-hydroxyl cannot be readily accommodated in the binding site. The specificity of the interaction for hydroxyls at the 22R- versus the 20 alpha-position is altered upon reduction of the enzyme, indicating a reduction-induced conformational change in the active site. The specific interference of binding of 22R-hydroxy steroids by heme-bound carbon monoxide (but not oxygen), together with the known bond angles and distances for Fe-C-O and Fe-O-O, allows localization of the 22R-hydroxyl group on a line perpendicular to the heme plane, between 2 and 3 A from the iron."

https://openalex.org/W1496252763,"Glioma C62B cells were incubated for 18 h with [1-14C]arachidonic acid. Most (80%) of the added [1-14C] arachidonic acid was taken into the intracellular pool; less than 1% of the intracellular [1-14C]arachidonic acid remained unesterified; the rest was present in glycerophospholipids. Acetylcholine stimulation of the prelabeled cells resulted in the rapid accumulation of free [1-14C]arachidonic acid, presumably liberated by hydrolysis from phospholipids. Labeled unesterified [1-14C]arachidonic acid peaked by 90 s and returned to basal levels by 5 min. Paralleling the transient increase of unesterified [1-14C]arachidonic acid were increases in level of radioactivity in an unidentified lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid and of radioactive phosphatidic acid. The release of arachidonic acid induced by acetylcholine or carbachol was blocked by muscarinic but not nicotinic receptor antagonists; adrenergic or histaminergic receptor agonists were ineffective at stimulating arachidonic acid liberation. In contrast to the transient effects of stimulation with cholinergic agonists, stimulation with the divalent cation ionophore A23187 resulted in a linear increase in the accumulation of liberated arachidonic acid for at least 1 h. Furthermore, the pattern of metabolites synthesized from arachidonic acid in response to ionophore stimulation was more complex than that observed following cholinergic stimulation and included also several metabolites derived from cyclooxygenase activity. We conclude that muscarinic receptor agonists rapidly induce specific changes in arachidonic acid and phosphatidic acid metabolism in a glioma cell line and suggest that similar responses may occur in glial cells and play a physiologically significant role in neural metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2011186002,"Rat optic and sciatic nerves were crushed, and 10 minutes to 3 days later nerve segments between the crushed site and the cell body were removed and assayed for posttranslational protein modification by amino acid addition. Protein modification was comparable in intact optic and sciatic nerves, but in sciatic nerves increased to 1.6 times control levels 10 minutes after crushing and reached a maximum of ten times control levels by 2 hours. In optic nerves activity was decreased throughout the time course studied. The results indicate that, in a nerve which is capable of regeneration (sciatic), protein modification by the addition of amino acids increases immediately after injury, but a nerve incapable of regeneration (optic) is incapable of activating the modification reaction. These findings may be important in understanding the reasons for the lack of a regenerative response after injury to central mammalian nerves."
https://openalex.org/W1546437332,"Mutant forms of human serum albumin have been detected on the basis of their abnormal electrophoretic mobility which is either faster or slower than that of normal albumin. In the present work we have studied the structure of a slow variant, referred to as albumin Ge/Ct, in order to define the cause of its genetic abnormality. The protein was isolated from the serum of a young healthy woman homozygous for the variant. Analysis of CNBr fragments by isoelectric focusing allowed us to localize the mutation to the COOH-terminal region of the molecule (residues 549-585). This fragment was isolated on a preparative scale and subjected to tryptic digestion. All tryptic peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized. Sequential analysis of three abnormal peptides revealed that albumin Ge/Ct has a shortened chain with the following COOH-terminal sequence: Leu-Val-Ala-Ala-Ser-Lys580-Leu-Pro. The presence of an additional lysine residue accounts for the electrophoretic behavior of the variant. It is likely that the variant may be caused by a single base deletion in the structural gene, a Cyt in mRNA codon 580, and the consequent shift in reading frame."
https://openalex.org/W2141029077,"We have determined the activation parameters of kcat and kcat/Km for the carbonic anhydrase II-catalyzed hydration of CO2. The enthalpy and entropy of activation for kcat is 7860 +/- 120 cal mol-1 and -3.99 +/- 0.42 cal mol-1 K-1, respectively, for the human enzyme. Results for the bovine enzyme were statistically indistinguishable from those of the human enzyme. The entropy of activation of kcat for the human enzyme was further decomposed into partially compensating electrostatic(es) (delta S*es = +15.1 cal mol-1 K-1) and nonelectrostatic(nes) (delta S*nes = -19.1 cal mol-1 K-1) terms. Computer simulations of a formal kinetic mechanism for carbonic anhydrase II-catalyzed CO2 hydration show that 82% of the temperature effect on kcat can be attributed to the temperature effect on the intramolecular proton transfer step. The reported activation parameters are consistent with a substantial enzyme or active site solvent conformational change in the transition state of the intramolecular proton transfer step, and is consistent with the mechanism of proton transfer proposed by Venkatasubban and Silverman (Venkatasubban, K. S., and Silverman, D. N. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 4984-4989)."
https://openalex.org/W1578080890,"Abstract We showed previously that a single mutation (T54----A54) within the highly conserved GT psi C sequence in the Escherichia coli SuIII tRNA gene results in an Su- phenotype, and we presented preliminary evidence that this mutation affected biosynthesis of the tRNA. We now show that the A54 mutation has no effect on transcription but prevents accumulation of mature mutant tRNA. The absence of mature mutant tRNA is due to blocks in processing of the precursor tRNA and is not due to instability of the mature tRNA. Characterization of the A54 precursors (approximately 130, approximately 90, and approximately 85 nucleotides long), which accumulate in E. coli minicells, indicates multiple blocks to processing of mutant transcripts. All three size classes of precursors have heterogeneous 3'-termini and contain extensions of three to seven nucleotides beyond the 3'-CCA sequence of mature tRNA indicating either a block or delay in 3'-exonucleolytic processing. The approximately 130- and approximately 90-nucleotide-long precursors also have 5'-terminal extensions suggesting a block in the 5'-processing reaction catalyzed by RNase P. Only the approximately 85-nucleotide-long precursor, which represents a small fraction of the total tRNA precursors, has the correct 5'-end of the mature tRNA."

There was 32-73% of the 14C and 8-12% of the 13C in carbons 3 and 4 of the glucoses with the remaining 14C and 13C distributed about equally in the other carbons. Incorporations of 14C from [2-14C]acetone (14-39%) also exceeded those from [2-14C]pyruvate (8-10%) into carbons 3 and 4 of glucoses formed by hepatocytes from rats fed acetone or fasted. [2-14C]Acetone and [2-14C]pyruvate were infused into rats that were fed, fasted, given acetone in their drinking water, or in diabetic ketosis. Thirty-seven to 52% of the 14C in the glucoses formed was in their carbons 3 and 4 when the acetone was infused and 8 to 14% when the pyruvate was infused. [1,3-14C]Hydroxybutyrate was formed by the rats in diabetic ketosis given [2-14C]acetone.

https://openalex.org/W1525252868,"The biochemical mechanisms of adenylate cyclase desensitization in arginine vasopressin-responsive epithelial cells remain unclear. Preincubation of cultured rabbit renal cortical collecting tubular cells with arginine vasopressin leads to a 30-100% decline in arginine vasopressin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. This loss of adenylate cyclase activity is time- and arginine vasopressin concentration-dependent. Preincubation with arginine vasopressin does not result in significant changes in basal, NaF-, forskolin-, isoproterenol- or cholera toxin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Preincubation of cells with chlorophenylthio-cAMP, forskolin, and cholera toxin does not result in loss of arginine vasopressin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Since products of cyclo-oxygenase inhibit arginine vasopressin action, cells were preincubated with indomethacin. Arginine vasopressin-induced adenylate cyclase desensitization is not reversed by indomethacin. By contrast, incubation with pertussis toxin prevents arginine vasopressin-induced adenylate cycle desensitization. These data demonstrate that arginine vasopressin induces homologous desensitization in membranes from cultured rabbit cortical collecting tubular cells and suggest that this desensitization is mediated, at least in part, by pertussis toxin substrate. These observations provide a unifying mechanism for desensitization of adenylate cyclase-coupled hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1594634892,"The dynamics and pathways of CO2 movements across the membranes of mitochondria respiring in vitro in a CO2/HCO-3 buffer at concentrations close to that in intact rat tissues were continuously monitored with a gas-permeable CO2-sensitive electrode. O2 uptake and pH changes were monitored simultaneously. Factors affecting CO2 entry were examined under conditions in which CO2 uptake was coupled to electrophoretic influx of K+ (in the presence of valinomycin) or Ca2+. The role of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1) in CO2 entry was evaluated by comparison of CO2 uptake by rat liver mitochondria, which possess carbonic anhydrase, versus rat heart mitochondria, which lack carbonic anhydrase. Such studies showed that matrix carbonic anhydrase activity is essential for rapid net uptake of CO2 with K+ or Ca2+. Studies with acetazolamide (Diamox), a potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, confirmed the requirement of matrix carbonic anhydrase for net CO2 uptake. It was shown that at pH 7.2 the major species leaving respiring mitochondria is dissolved CO2, rather than HCO-3 or H2CO3 suggested by earlier reports. Efflux of endogenous CO2/HCO-3 is significantly inhibited by inhibitors of the dicarboxylate and tricarboxylate transport systems of the rat liver inner membrane.

Destruction of bacteriochlorophyll is associated with a target size of 7 kDa. This indicates that each one of the two different 6-kDa holochrome polypeptides binds one molecule of this pigment. The target size of spirilloxanthin, 12 kDa, suggests that both polypeptides contribute to the binding site of this carotenoid.

Addition of the triazene to a perfused liver prevented the complete degradation of endocytosed N-acetyl[14C]glucosamine-labeled asialo-AGP and caused the accumulation of Man2GlcNAc1 fragments in the lysosome-enriched fraction of the liver homogenate. This compound also reduced the reincorporation of lysosomally derived [14C]GlcNAc into newly secreted glycoproteins. Cultured hepatocytes treated with the inhibitor synthesized and secreted fully glycosylated AGP. However, the N-linked oligosaccharide chains on AGP secreted by the alpha-ManMNT-treated hepatocytes remained sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H, were resistant to neuraminidase, and consisted of Man9-7GlcNAc2 structures as analyzed by high resolution Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography. As measured by their resistance to cleavage by endoglycosidase H, the normal processing of all six carbohydrate chains on AGP to the complex form did not completely resume until nearly 24 h after triazene treatment. Since alpha-ManMNT is likely to irreversibly inactivate alpha-D-mannosidases, the return of normal AGP secretory forms after 24 h probably resulted from synthesis of new processing enzymes."

Oligosaccharides present on intracellular mu-chain precursors were of the high mannose type, remaining susceptible to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. However, only 26% of the radioactivity was released from [3H]mannose-labeled secreted IgM glycopeptides, consistent with the presence of high mannose-type and complex-type oligosaccharides on the mature mu-chain. [3H]Mannose-labeled cyanogen bromide glycopeptides derived from mu-chains of secreted IgM were isolated and analyzed to identify the glycopeptide containing the high mannose-type oligosaccharide from those containing complex-type structures. [3H]Mannose-labeled intracellular mu-chain cyanogen bromide glycopeptides corresponding to those from secreted IgM were isolated also, and the time courses of oligosaccharide processing at the individual glycosylation sites were determined. The major oligosaccharides on all intracellular mu-chain glycopeptides after 20 min of pulse labeling with [3H]mannose were identified as Man8GlcNAc2, Man9GlcNAc2, and Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Processing of the oligosaccharide destined to become the high mannose-type structure on the mature protein was rapid. After 30 min of chase incubation the predominant structures of this oligosaccharide were Man5GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 which were also identified on the high mannose-type oligosaccharide of the secreted mu-chain. In contrast, processing of oligosaccharides destined to become complex type was considerably slower. Even after 180 min of chase incubation, Man7GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 were the predominant structures at some of these glycosylation sites. The isomeric structures of Man8GlcNAc2 obtained from all of the glycosylation sites were identical.

https://openalex.org/W1561013069,"The effect of aqueous methanol cryosolvents on the catalytic and structural properties of bovine trypsin has been investigated. The low freezing points and low viscosities of methanol-based cryosolvents are desirable for a variety of cryoenzymological experiments. Increasing concentrations of methanol caused increases in the values of kcat and Km for the hydrolysis of N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine p-nitrophenyl ester at 0 degrees C and a small increase in Ki for inhibition by benzamidine. Based on product analysis the increase in kcat with increasing methanol concentration at pH* 4.0 and 6.5 can be completely accounted for by nucleophilic competition of methanol for the acyl enzyme intermediate. This observation indicates that deacylation is the rate-limiting step under these conditions. The effect of increasing methanol concentration on kcat/Km for the above ester substrate and N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide was similar. Incubation experiments indicated that trypsin was quite stable in 70% methanol at 0 degrees C and below. The Arrhenius plot for the catalytic reaction in 70% methanol was linear over the 0 to -40 degrees C range, indicating no change in rate-determining step nor temperature-induced structural perturbation. No evidence for structural effects induced by methanol or temperature were detected by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence and absorbance. We conclude that aqueous methanol cryosolvents are satisfactory for cryosolvent studies of trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1541661673,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies have been raised against a dimeric cell surface antigen (p75/150) which is specifically associated with the tumorigenic phenotype in human fibroblast X HeLa hybrids. During biosynthesis, a precursor molecule (p70/140), was associated with microsomal membranes in vivo but possessed no detectable cytoplasmic domains. At this stage, each p70 monomer contained 3 high-mannose type N-linked glycans which were subsequently processed into endoglycosidase H-insensitive complex oligosaccharides on the mature cell surface forms. Cleavage of this cell surface form with endoglycosidase F yielded non-N-glycosylated polypeptides of Mr = 60,000/120,000. All the monoclonal antibodies identified similar non-N-glycosylated polypeptides in cells grown in the presence of tunicamycin. p75/150 could be weakly labeled with [3H]palmitic or myristic acid. In vivo, p75/150 was found to be phosphorylated on serine residues. Immunoprecipitates of p75/150 from HeLa or tumorigenic hybrid cell lysates exhibited protein kinase activity in vitro, which phosphorylated p75/150 itself, also on serine residues. We were unable to detect this kinase activity in normal fibroblasts and in the nontumorigenic hybrid cells. Furthermore, we were unable to detect p75/150 or its precursors by either cell surface labeling, metabolic labeling, or Western blotting in nontumorigenic cell hybrids; p75/150 thus represents a tumor-specific marker in this system. Tryptic peptides of highly purified p75/150 have been generated, but their amino acid sequences did not reveal any significant homology with previously described proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1537794761,"Chloroplastic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase from bean leaves is purified under optimal protective conditions over 4,900-fold. Its apparent molecular weight is 78,000, as determined by gel filtration, with a dimeric subunit structure of alpha beta (alpha = 33,000 and beta = 42,000), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. This indicates a drastic size reduction of 40% for each subunit compared to the corresponding cytoplasmic enzyme and a unique quaternary structure. Heterologous aminoacylation and substrate properties of ATP analogs indicate substantial differences in the topographies of the substrate binding domains of these two heterotopic intracellular plant enzymes. No common antigenic determinants with the bean cytoplasmic enzyme were detected by polyclonal antibodies against the chloroplastic enzyme. The same negative result applies to the immunological comparison with the partially purified enzymes from the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans and the photosynthetic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium limicola that both have a molecular weight of 260,000."
