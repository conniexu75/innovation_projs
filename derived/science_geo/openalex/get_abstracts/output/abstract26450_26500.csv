https://openalex.org/W2024645073,"The probability that a residue in a protein is part of a coiled-coil structure was assessed by comparison of its flanking sequences with sequences of known coiled-coil proteins. This method was used to delineate coiled-coil domains in otherwise globular proteins, such as the leucine zipper domains in transcriptional regulators, and to predict regions of discontinuity within coiled-coil structures, such as the hinge region in myosin. More than 200 proteins that probably have coiled-coil domains were identified in GenBank, including alpha- and beta-tubulins, flagellins, G protein beta subunits, some bacterial transfer RNA synthetases, and members of the heat shock protein (Hsp70) family."
https://openalex.org/W1995829317,"Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of ω-functionalized long-chain alkanethiolates on gold films are excellent model systems with which to study the interactions of proteins with organic surfaces. Monolayers containing mixtures of hydrophobic (methyl-terminated) and hydrophilic [hydroxyl-, maltose-, and hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminated] alkanethiols can be tailored to select specific degrees of adsorption: the amount of protein adsorbed varies monotonically with the composition of the monolayer. The hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminated SAMs are the most effective in resisting protein adsorption. The ability to create interfaces with similar structures and well-defined compositions should make it possible to test hypotheses concerning protein adsorption."
https://openalex.org/W2054395379,"When rhesus monkeys were infected with a form of cloned SIVmac239 having a premature stop signal at the 93rd codon of nef, revertants with a coding codon at this position quickly and universally came to predominate in the infected animals. This suggests that there are strong selective forces for open functional forms of nef in vivo. Although deletion of nef sequences had no detectable effect on virus replication in cultured cells, deletion of nef sequences dramatically altered the properties of virus in infected rhesus monkeys. Our results indicate that nef is required for maintaining high virus loads during the course of persistent infection in vivo and for full pathologic potential. Thus, nef should become a target for antiviral drug development. Furthermore, the properties of virus with a deletion in nef suggest a means for making live-attenuated strains of virus for experimental vaccine testing."
https://openalex.org/W2051013729,"The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance. Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site. Probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment. Normal transmitting males had a 150- to 400-base pair insertion that was inherited by their daughters either unchanged, or with small differences in size. Fragile X-positive individuals in the next generation had much larger fragments that differed among siblings and showed a generally heterogeneous pattern indicating somatic mutation. The mutated allele appeared unmethylated in normal transmitting males, methylated only on the inactive X chromosome in their daughters, and totally methylated in most fragile X males. However, some males had a mosaic pattern. Expression of the fragile X syndrome thus appears to result from a two-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation. Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2037564010,"Neurons in area 17 of cat visual cortex display oscillatory responses that can synchronize across spatially separate columns in a stimulus-specific way. Response synchronization has now been shown to occur also between neurons in area 17 of the right and left cerebral hemispheres. This synchronization was abolished by section of the corpus callosum. Thus, the response synchronization is mediated by corticocortical connections. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that temporal synchrony of neuronal discharges serves to bind features within and between the visual hemifields."
https://openalex.org/W2075965099,"Epiligrin is a new glycoprotein in most epithelial basement membranes (BMs) and is a ligand for cell adhesion via integrin alpha 3 beta 1. In the extracellular matrix of human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs), epiligrin contains three disulfide-bonded, glycoprotein subunits, E170, E145, and E135, based on molecular size in kilodaltons. Epiligrin, immunopurified with MAb P1E1, induced cell adhesion and localization of integrin alpha 3 beta 1 in focal adhesions (FAs). Cell adhesion to epiligrin was inhibited with an anti-alpha 3 beta 1 MAb. Epiligrin also colocalized with integrin alpha 6 beta 4 in hemidesmosome-like stable anchoring contacts (SACs). alpha 3 beta 1-FAs encircled alpha 6 beta 4-SACs in a complex adhesion structure. alpha 3 beta 1 and epiligrin localized in BM junctions of epithelial cells primarily in organs of endodermal/ectodermal origin. In epidermis, epiligrin was detected in the lamina lucida of BMs. alpha 3 beta 1 localized in plasma membranes of basal cells in contact with epiligrin and also in lateral/apical membranes. Epiligrin is the ligand of an adhesion super complex composed of alpha 3 beta 1-FAs and alpha 6 beta 4-SACs (hemidesmosomes)."
https://openalex.org/W1560153159,"Sixty-two snake venoms were screened to identify those which specifically inhibit the adhesive protein binding function of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex, the receptor-mediating platelet aggregation. Although 52 of these venoms inhibited GPIIb-IIIa, only one of these, from the southeastern pigmy rattlesnake, Sistrurus m. barbouri, was specific for GPIIb-IIIa versus other integrins. The peptide responsible for this activity, termed barbourin, was sequenced and found to be highly homologous to other peptides of the viper venom GPIIb-IIIa antagonist family but was the first member which did not contain the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) amino acid sequence, believed to be required for inhibition of receptor function. Instead, barbourin contains the sequence, Lys-Gly-Asp (KGD). The conservative Lys for Arg substitution appears to be the sole structural feature which imparts integrin specificity to barbourin, since venom peptide analogs with Lys substitutions were also specific for GPIIb-IIIa. Thus, barbourin represents a new structural model useful for designing potent and GPIIb-IIIa-specific compounds that may have therapeutic value as platelet aggregation inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1518605826,"Proteinase 3 (PR-3) is a human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) serine proteinase that degrades elastin in vitro and causes emphysema when administered by tracheal insufflation to hamsters (Kao, R. C., Wehner, N. G., Skubitz, K. M., Gray, B. H., and Hoidal, J. R. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 82, 1963-1973). We have determined the primary structure of several PR-3 peptides and have analyzed catalytic properties of the enzyme. The enzyme has considerable amino acid sequence homology with two other well characterized PMNL neutral serine proteinases, elastase and cathepsin G. Furthermore, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of PR-3 is identical to that of the target antigen of the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies associated with Wegener's granulomatosis. PR-3 degrades a variety of matrix proteins including fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagen type IV. It shows no or minimal activity against interstitial collagens types I and III, respectively. The analysis of peptides generated by PR-3 digestion of insulin chains and the activity profile against a panel of chromogenic synthetic peptide substrates show that PR-3 prefers small aliphatic amino acids (alanine, serine, and valine) at the P1 site. The elastase-like specificity of PR-3 is consistent with its striking sequence homology to elastase at substrate binding sites. PR-3 is inhibited by alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (ka = 8.1 x 10(6) M-1 S-1; delay time = 25 ms) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (ka = 1.1 x 10(7) M-1 S-1; delay time = 114 ms) but not by alpha 1-anti-chymotrypsin. In contrast to elastase and cathepsin G, PR-3 is not inhibited by secretory leukoprotease inhibitor and is weakly inhibited by eglin c. Thus, PR-3 is distinct from the other PMNL proteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1990313351,"At fertilization, sperm chromatin decondenses in two stages, which can be mimicked in extracts of Xenopus eggs. Rapid, limited decondensation is followed by slower, membrane-dependent decondensation and swelling. Nucleoplasmin, an acidic nuclear protein, occurs at high concentration in Xenopus eggs and has a histone-binding role in nucleosome assembly. Immunodepleting nucleoplasmin from egg extracts inhibits the initial rapid stage of sperm decondensation, and also the decondensation of myeloma nuclei, relative to controls of mock depletion and TFIIIA depletion. Readdition of purified nucleoplasmin recues depleted extracts. A physiological concentration of purified nucleoplasmin alone decondenses both sperm and myeloma nuclei. We conclude that nucleoplasmin is both necessary and sufficient for the first stage of sperm decondensation in Xenopus eggs."
https://openalex.org/W1603513572,"To mimic the active sites (Trp-Cys-Gly-His-Cys) contained in two thioredoxin-like domains of the eukaryotic enzyme protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1), the Pro-34 residue of Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx) was replaced by His using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant P34H Trx was isolated in high yield and was stable. The equilibrium between Trx and NADPH in the thioredoxin reductase (TR)-catalyzed reaction revealed that the redox potential (E'o) or P34H Trx at pH 7.0 was -235 mV as compared with -270 mV for wild type (wt) Trx. The higher E'o value made P34H Trx more similar to PDI and contributed to prominent changes in Trx functions, e.g. improved activity with TR and slower reduction of protein disulfides. Compared to wt Trx, the P34H oxidized Trx was about twice as good a substrate for TR from E. coli and four times as efficient with calf thymus TR. A novel fluorimetric assay permitted direct recording of the reaction between insulin disulfide(s) and reduced Trx. At pH 8 and 15 degrees C, second-order rate constants for wt Trx of 2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 and for P34H Trx of 3 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 were obtained, and a different equilibrium was observed consistent with differences in E'o values. Also when the reduction mechanism of insulin was examined using NADPH and TR, P34H Trx behaved differently from wt Trx or PDI. P34H Trx may be useful as an analogue of PDI for disulfide formation in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1588654922,"Roots of several solanaceous plants produce anticholinergic alkaloids, hyoscyamine and scopolamine. Hyoscyamine 6 beta-hydroxylase, a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.11), catalyzes hydroxylation of hyoscyamine in the biosynthetic pathway leading to scopolamine. We report here on the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the hydroxylase from a cDNA library made from mRNA of the cultured roots of Hyoscyamus niger. The library was screened with three synthetic oligonucleotides that encode amino acid sequences of internal peptide fragments of the purified hydroxylase. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA revealed an open reading frame that encodes 344 amino acids (Mr = 38,999). All 12 internal peptide fragments determined in the purified enzyme were found in the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA. With computer-aided comparison to other proteins we found that the hydroxylase is homologous to two synthases involved in the biosynthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics in some microorganisms and the gene products of tomato pTOM13 cDNA and maize A2 locus which had been proposed to catalyze oxidative reactions in the biosynthesis of ethylene and anthocyan, respectively. RNA blotting hybridization showed that mRNA of the hydroxylase is abundant in cultured roots and present in plant roots, but absent in leaves, stems, and cultured cells of H. niger."
https://openalex.org/W1985029525,"The filamentous bacterium S. coelicolor differentiates by forming aerial hyphae, which protrude into the air and metamorphose into chains of spores. Aerial hyphae formation is associated with the production of a small, abundant protein, SapB, which is present in a zone around colonies of differentiating bacteria. Production of SapB is impaired in bld mutants, which are blocked in aerial hyphae formation, but not in whi mutants in which spore formation is prevented. We report that aerial hyphae formation by a newly identified bld mutant is restored by juxtaposition of the mutant near colonies of SapB-producing bacteria or by the application of the purified protein near mutant colonies. These observations implicate SapB in aerial mycelium formation and suggest that SapB is a morphogenetic protein that enables hyphae on the surface of colonies to grow into the air."
https://openalex.org/W1513452909,"Suramin, a polysulfonated naphthylurea, has anti-reverse transcriptase and anti-proliferative activities and inhibits the binding of various growth factors to their cell surface receptors. This drug is used in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and several types of cancers. Increased levels of circulating glycosaminoglycans have been observed in suramin-treated cancer patients, suggesting that it may inhibit glycosaminoglycan catabolism. Melanoma-derived heparanase, a heparan sulfate-specific endo-beta-D-glucuronidase that plays an important role in metastatic melanoma cell invasion through basement membranes, is inhibited by suramin in a dose-dependent manner: 100% inhibition was observed at a concentration of approximately 100 microM. Structurally related polysulfonated compounds, such as trypan blue and Evans blue, had lower heparanase inhibitory activities: the concentrations required for 50% heparanase inhibition (ID50) were 310-320 microM and six times higher than for suramin (ID50 = 46 microM). Oversulfated heparin tetrasaccharide, whose average molecular size is similar to suramin, had also much lower heparanase inhibitory activity than suramin. The inhibition constants (Ki) for suramin and oversulfated heparin tetrasaccharide were 48 and 290 microM, respectively. Suramin had a remarkable inhibitory activity against B16 melanoma cell invasion through reconstituted basement membranes (ID50 less than 10 microM). The inhibitory effects of suramin on melanoma heparanase and cell invasion appeared to be completely independent of its antiproliferative activity, because significant effects on melanoma cell growth were not observed at the concentrations of suramin used in this study. The results suggest that the antimetastatic effects of suramin may be due to its antiinvasive rather than antiproliferative activities."
https://openalex.org/W1627204327,"Human protein C (HPC) is an antithrombotic serine protease that circulates in the plasma as several glycoforms. To examine the role of glycosylation in the function of this protein, we singly eliminated each of the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis of Asn to Gln at amino acid positions 97, 248, and 313 (HPC derivatives Q097, Q248, and Q313) or at the unusual consensus sequence Asn-X-Cys at 329 (HPC derivative Q329). The cDNAs for wild type and each derivative were inserted into expression vectors and expressed both transiently and stably in human 293 and hamster AV12-664 cells. We demonstrate that N-linked glycosylation at position 97 in the light chain of HPC is critical for efficient secretion and affects the degree of core glycosylation at Asn-329. Glycosylation at position 248 affects the intracellular processing of the internal Lys-Arg (KR) KR cleavage site, and partial glycosylation at the sequence Asn-329-X-Cys is responsible for the natural alpha-glycoform. Altering the glycosylation pattern of the protein had no significant effect on the level of fully gamma-carboxylated HPC secreted from the 293 cell line. However, elimination of glycosylation sites in the heavy chain resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in anticoagulant activity. Utilizing synthetic substrate, both the Km and kcat were affected, depending on the specific glycosylation site eliminated. However, there were no significant differences in the inhibition kinetics by alpha-1-antitrypsin (association rate constants of 10-11 M-1s-1 and t1/2 of 27-29 min at 40 microM alpha-1-antitrypsin) or t1/2 in human plasma (17-18 min). A comparison of the rate of activation of each derivative by thrombin alone or in complex with thrombomodulin revealed that Q313 was activated approximately 2.5-fold faster than wt HPC, independent of calcium concentration. This increase in rate was due to an enhanced affinity of thrombin-thrombomodulin for Q313, as indicated by a 3-fold reduction in Km. Overall, our studies demonstrate that glycosylation at different sites in HPC affects distinct properties of this complex protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to improve the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme through carbohydrate modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1571190264,"The mechanism of catalysis of Escherichia coli-derived Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA: protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) has been characterized. Previous studies indicated that a high affinity reaction intermediate forms between NMT and myristoyl-CoA in the absence of a peptide substrate. This complex has been further characterized using S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable myristoyl-CoA analog. Binding studies involving this analog, as well as myristoylpeptide and CoA, have indicated that the CoA moiety of the acyl substrate is retained in the acyl-NMT complex prior to peptide addition. These structural data, along with kinetic studies of myristoylpeptide and CoA product inhibition, indicate that the mechanism of catalysis of NMT is ordered Bi Bi, with myristoyl-CoA binding to NMT occurring prior to peptide binding and CoA release taking place before release of acyl peptide. Further analyses of the interactions between NMT, acyl peptide, and CoA demonstrate that NMT is able to deacylate a myristoylpeptide in the presence of CoA."
https://openalex.org/W2007166746,"A large pool of free class I heavy chains is detected in situ on the plasma membrane of living cells. These chains are present on cells of different MHC genotypes and appear to exist under physlological conditions in vivo. These molecules arise from the dissociation of previously assembled class I heterodimers at the cell surface. The ratio of intact to dissociated heterodimers is strongly affected by the occupancy of the peptidebinding site of the class I molecule. Upon dissociation of the heterodimer, the class I molecule is functionally inactive. These findings may help to explain why class I molecules on the cell surface are unreceptive to binding peptides yet readily associate with peptides in the presence of exogenous β2-microglobulin. These results have implications for understanding the distinct functions of class I versus class II molecules and how the immunological identity of cells is preserved."
https://openalex.org/W1597535871,"Bovine vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) were examined for production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) which may play a key role in regulating the fibrinolytic system. Growth-arrested SMC released active PAI (101 arbitrary units (AU)/10(6) cells/24 h) and a latent form of PAI (880 AU/10(6) cells/24 h) into the conditioned medium (CM). The levels of PAI were significant since 880 AU of PAI could inhibit approximately 1 microgram of tissue plasminogen activator. The extracellular matrix of SMC also contained PAI activity; however, the level was 17-fold less than that observed in the CM. SMC-PAI was a rapid inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (kass greater than 10(7) M-1 S-1) and was identified as a 45-kDa protein immunologically related to endothelial cell PAI-1. PAI-1 comprised 20 and 30%, respectively, of the newly synthesized protein detected in the CM and extracellular matrix of SMC. The SMC growth modulators, platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta, induced PAI-1 activity and protein synthesis by 2- and 3-fold, respectively, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increases in PAI-1 activity and protein synthesis were ascribed to elevated levels of PAI-1 mRNA as judged by Northern blot analysis of total RNA prepared from control and platelet-derived growth factor- and transforming growth factor-beta-treated cells. Increases in PAI-1 mRNA levels were evident 1 h after growth factor treatment and were maximal after 4 h. PAI-1 mRNA levels were unaffected by cycloheximide treatment. The results indicate that SMC synthesize and release PAI-1 which could regulate the normal fibrinolytic environment of the arterial wall. During atherosclerosis or after vascular injury increases in platelet-derived or locally produced mitogens may stimulate further PAI-1 synthesis and generate a prothrombotic state."
https://openalex.org/W1977296632,"The proto-oncogene wnt-1 (previously referred to as int-1) is thought to be important in embryonic pattern formation although its mechanisms of action are unknown. Premature and increased expression of the Wnt-1 protein, achieved by injection of synthetic wnt-1 RNA into fertilized Xenopus eggs, enhanced gap junctional communication between ventral cells of the developing embryo. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Wnt proteins activate a receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway and that gap junctional communication can be a target of this pathway. The effects of two Wnt-1-related proteins on gap junctional communication were also investigated: overexpression of Xwnt-8 increased gap junctional coupling in a manner similar to Wnt-1, whereas Xwnt-5A did not. These findings are consistent with the existence of multiple receptors for Wnt proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2110335040,"The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been criticized because its products are perceived to be too expensive, yet prescription medicines remain the least expensive form of therapy. At this time, we are experiencing a dramatic increase in the risks and costs of pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). An example may be seen in the R&D history of lovastatin. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry continues to lead the world in the discovery and development of important new medicines because it assumes greater financial risk and invests more of its sales dollar in R&D than virtually any other industry. Where such a risk is posed, there must continue to be the potential for profits. Pharmaceutical companies must set responsible prices, must keep price increases down, and must help improve access to important medicines."
https://openalex.org/W1557228498,"An autoradiographic assay applicable to colonies immobilized on filter paper was developed for obtaining temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli defective in the transfer of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) from CMP-KDO to a tetraacyldisaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate precursor of lipid A, designated lipid IVA. Cell-free extracts from two mutants found in a population of 30,000 mutagen-treated cells showed normal KDO transferase activity when assayed at 30 degrees C, but almost no activity at 42 degrees C. The mutation was mapped by mating one of the mutants with different Hfr strains and analyzing genetic linkage of KDO transferase activity to selectable markers. The lesion was located to a position between 80 and 84 min on the E. coli chromosome. A plasmid from the Clarke and Carbon collection (Clarke, L., and Carbon, J. (1976) Cell 9, 91-99), pLC17-24, known to contain genes from the rfa region (81 min), was shown to overexpress KDO transferase activity 4-5 times and to correct the mutation when the plasmid was conjugated into the mutant strains. The KDO transferase gene, designated kdtA, was subcloned from pLC17-24 into a multicopy vector. The resulting plasmid, pCL3, overproduced transferase activity approximately 100-fold. The kdtA gene was shown to code for a 43-kDa polypeptide, as judged by radiolabeling of minicells. Its DNA sequence was determined. The results demonstrate that overexpression of this single gene product greatly stimulates the incorporation of two stereochemically distinct KDO residues during lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in extracts of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1567276231,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a widespread environmental toxicant, is a tumor promoter that induces hyperplasia in epithelial cells. Exposure of cultured human keratinocytes to TCDD, resulted in a time-dependent dioxin-specific Ah receptor-mediated release of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) into the culture medium. Cultures exposed to TCDD showed a rate of TGF-alpha secretion into the medium of about 30 fmol/ml/day, as well as a 3- to 6-fold increase in TGF-alpha mRNA expression. Increased production of TGF-alpha in human keratinocytes exposed to TCDD demonstrates a modulation of autocrine regulation in those cells. These results suggest that induction of TGF-alpha could be an important part of the mechanism of dioxin-mediated toxicity and tumor promotion."
https://openalex.org/W1485573785,"Bovine microtubule-associated protein-4 (MAP-4), which was previously named MAP-U, consists of an amino-terminal projection domain (N-domain) and a carboxyl-terminal microtubule-binding domain (C-domain) (Aizawa, H., Emori, Y., Murofushi, H., Kawasaki, H., Sakai, H., and Suzuki, K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13849-13855). The C-domain contains a region rich in proline (Pro-rich region) and a region containing four assembly-promoting sequences (AP sequence region) which is shared by MAP-2 and tau. We purified a series of truncated fragments of MAP-4 expressed in Escherichia coli. An N-domain fragment did not bind to microtubules, while a C-domain fragment promoted microtubule assembly. Both of the fragments corresponding to the Pro-rich region (P fragment) and the AP sequence region (A4 fragment) promoted tubulin polymerization, although the A4 fragment had lower activity than intact MAP-4 and P fragment. A4 fragment produced morphologically normal microtubules whereas P fragment produced abnormal microtubules such as duplex microtubules and tight bundles of microtubules with diverse diameters. We concluded that both Pro-rich and AP sequence regions take part in the promotion of tubulin polymerization, and that the former is important for the MAP to bind to microtubules with high efficiency and the latter is essential for the formation of microtubules with normal morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1608912555,"The sequence of a 3.65-kilobase cDNA encoding a large portion of the polypeptide chain of porcine submaxillary mucin (apomucin) has been completed. The encoded polypeptide contains 1150 residues with the carboxyl-terminal 240 residues forming a globular domain that is rich in half-cystine, but deficient in sites for oligosaccharide attachment. The remaining 910 residues preceding the half-cystine-rich domain appear devoid of secondary structures, but they are rich in serine and threonine to which the O-linked oligosaccharides are bound. The first 391 residues of apomucin contain several tandemly repeated, identical sequences of 81 residues. Blots of genomic DNA partially digested with restriction nucleases show that at least 25 of these identical repeats are present in apomucin. The amino acid composition of apomucin isolated in the absence of protease inhibitors was shown earlier (Eckhardt, A. E., Timpte, C. S., Abernethy, J. L., Toumadje, A., Johnson, W. C., Jr., and Hill, R. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 11339-11344) to be devoid of half-cystine. In contrast, the amino acid composition of mucin purified in the presence of protease inhibitors contains half-cystine in amounts predicted by the cDNA sequence and also suggests that this mucin has about 25 tandem repeats. Thus, apomucin contains at least 2800 amino acid residues. Moreover, immunoblots of apomucin prepared in the presence or the absence of protease inhibitors, with antibodies specific for the half-cystine-rich domains or the tandem repeat sequences, show that the half-cystine-rich domain is absent in apomucin unless protease inhibitors are present throughout. Both types of mucin, however, contain the highly repetitive sequences. The molecular weight of undegraded apomucin has not been established exactly, but gel filtration in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride suggests that it is considerably higher than 250,000. RNA blot analysis shows that apomucin mRNA is large and polydisperse in accord with the message size necessary to synthesize the large apomucin polypeptide. These structural features of apomucin suggest a model for the structure of the mucin molecule that correlates well with its reported properties."
https://openalex.org/W1573623176,"Insulin-like growth factor I plays a major role in cellular growth by mediating many of the actions of growth hormone. In mammals, IGF-I gene expression is complicated, as the single-copy gene is transcribed and processed into multiple mRNAs that encode at least two peptide precursors. Recent cDNA cloning studies have suggested that in chickens the organization of the gene might be simpler, and that comparative mapping might define essential features of IGF-I that are common to vertebrates. To achieve this goal, we have cloned and characterized the chicken IGF-I gene. The chicken gene is more compact than its mammalian homologues. It is composed of 4 exons which are distributed over 50 kilobases (kb) of chromosomal DNA and are transcribed and processed into mRNAs of 1.9 and 2.6 kb. As in the rat and human genes, the mature 70-amino acid IGF-I molecule is encoded within exons 2 and 3, while exons 1 and 4 contain NH2- and COOH-terminal extension peptides, respectively, and untranslated sequences. Both ends of the chicken gene are structurally heterogeneous. IGF-I mRNAs were found to have two regions of polyadenylation which mapped to exon 4 and were separated by approximately 0.7 kb. At the 5' end, several transcription initiation sites were identified within a 74-nucleotide portion of exon 1 that was found to be highly conserved between chicken and mammalian IGF-I genes. To test promotor function, chimeric genes were constructed linking fragments of chicken IGF-I 5'-flanking DNA to a promoterless reporter plasmid. Hybrid genes containing at least 0.6 kb of IGF-I enhanced expression of luciferase after transfection into SK-N-MC cells, a human line that synthesizes IGF-I mRNA. These observations represent the first thorough characterization of an IGF-I gene and provide an impetus for discerning the mechanisms by which IGF-I expression is regulated during growth, development, and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1556915638,"The sensory transducer proteins in bacterial chemotaxis undergo two covalent modifications, deamidation and reversible methylation, in response to attractants and repellents. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to alter putative methylation and deamidation sites in one of the transducers to further define these sites and their role in chemotaxis. The mutations, in combination with peptide maps and Edman analysis, have clarified the sites of covalent modification in Tsr. Tsr contains six specific glutamates and glutamines that serve as methyl-accepting sites. An arginine-containing tryptic peptide (R1) has two sites, one at glutamate 493 and a newly located site at glutamate 502. A lysine-containing peptide (K1) has four methyl-accepting sites. Two of the lysine peptide sites are glutamates and can accept methyl groups without deamidation. The other two sites are glutamines and two methyl-accepting sites are created by two distinct deamidations. Both deamidations can occur on the same polypeptide chain. Single glutamate mutants have shown that one deamidation (at glutamine 311) proceeds rapidly, while the other deamidation (at glutamine 297) has a half-life of approximately 60 min under our experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1481342123,"In this study we report that bone and platelet osteonectin are structurally and functionally heterogeneous in terms of glycosylation and collagen binding capacity. The relative sensitivity of bone and platelet osteonectin to specific glycosidases was used to evaluate potential differences in glycosylation. Although native bone and platelet osteonectin are electrophoretically nonidentical, N-glycanase treatment yielded products with the same apparent molecular weight. Bone osteonectin was also susceptible to cleavage by endo H but not to neuraminidase, while platelet osteonectin was susceptible to neuraminidase but not to endo H. In lectin blotting experiments of bone and platelet osteonectin, concanavalin A bound specifically to bone osteonectin but not to platelet osteonectin. However, Lens culinaris agglutinin bound to platelet osteonectin but not to bone osteonectin. These data suggest that bone and platelet osteonectin differ in their oligosaccharide side chain structures, with bone osteonectin possessing a high mannose-type and platelet osteonectin, a complex-type structure. Solid-phase binding techniques were used to functionally evaluate bone and platelet osteonectin in terms of collagen binding. Although bone osteonectin bound specifically to types I, III, and V collagen, platelet osteonectin had no apparent affinity for these collagen types suggesting that the two proteins are also functionally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2005914932,"Naturally processed minor histocompatibility (H) peptides corresponding to H-4b, H-Y, and an unmapped BALB.B minor H gene were quantified in a relative way in 15 different tissues of male BALB.B mice. For one of these minor H antigens, we could also determine the relative content of the respective protein. For each minor H peptide, an individual tissue distribution was found. Tissues expressing little or no MHC (major histocompatibility complex), like brain, contained only small amounts of minor H peptides or none at all, although the same tissues contained minor H protein in substantial quantities. By contrast, Kb-expressing brains from mice transgenic for Kb under control of the glial acidic protein promoter contained both minor H peptide and protein in high amounts. Thus, the expression of minor H peptides in a given tissue is dependent on coexpression of the restricting MHC class I molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1534855681,"During the mating season the female mallards produce sex pheromones, diesters of 3-hydroxy fatty acids, in their uropygial glands. Subcellular fractionation by sucrose and Nycodenz density gradient centrifugations and electron microscopic examination of the fractions showed that diesters of 3-hydroxy acids and the enzymes that catalyze the formation and esterification of the 3-hydroxy fatty acids are located in the catalase-containing fractions, probably peroxisomes, whereas monoester synthesizing activities are located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Fatty acyl-CoA reductase that would provide fatty alcohol needed for the synthesis of monoester and diester waxes was found both in the peroxisomal and endoplasmic reticulum fraction. Upon daily intramuscular injection of estradiol into the females in the nonmating season, the short chain monoester waxes of the uropygial glands were replaced by long chain monoester waxes, and subsequently the monoester waxes were replaced by diester waxes. Injection of thyroxine with estradiol hastened the induction of the compositional changes including diester synthesis. Similar changes, including the synthesis of the female pheromones, were induced in the uropygial glands by the hormone treatment of males that do not normally produce diesters at any time during their life cycle. The structure and composition of the diesters induced by hormone treatment of both males and females were identical to those of the female pheromones produced during their mating season. Electron microscopic examination of diaminobenzidine-treated glands showed that peroxisomes proliferated in the gland of the females in the mating season and in the estradiol-treated males that produce the diesters."
https://openalex.org/W1510018037,"We previously have demonstrated that intramolecular interactions between alpha beta-alpha beta subunits are necessary for insulin-dependent activation of the protein kinase domain within a single alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin-receptor complex (Wilden, P. A., Morrison, B. D., and Pessin, J. E. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 785-792). To evaluate the role of the beta subunit transmembrane domain in the insulin-dependent signalling mechanism, mutant human insulin receptors containing a series of nested transmembrane domain deletions (amino acids 941-945) were generated and stable Chinese hamster ovary-transfected cell lines were obtained. In addition, a substitution of Val-938 for Glu (E/V938) similar to the oncogenic mutation found in the neu transmembrane domain was also introduced into the insulin receptor. Scatchard analysis of insulin binding to the stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing either wild type or mutant insulin receptors indicated equivalent receptor number (2-4 x 10(6)/cell) and similar high affinity binding constants (Kd 0.1-0.3 nM). 125I-Insulin affinity cross-linking demonstrated that all of the expressed insulin receptors were assembled and processed into alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complexes. Surprisingly, all the mutant insulin receptors retained insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, endogenous substrate phosphorylation in vivo as well as insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA were unaffected by the transmembrane domain mutations. These data demonstrate that marked structural alterations in the insulin receptor transmembrane domain do not interfere with insulin-dependent signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1527056107,"The biosynthesis of deazaflavins, flavins, ribonucleotides, and selected amino acids was studied in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum by incorporation of 13C-labeled acetate and pyruvate. 13C enrichments were monitored by 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The biosynthesis of ribonucleotides follows the standard pathway. The xylene ring of riboflavin is formed from two pentose moieties in agreement with studies in yeasts and eubacteria. The pyrimidine ring and the ribityl side chain of the deazaflavin chromophore of coenzyme F420 are derived from the purine nucleotide pool. The phenolic ring and C-5 of the deazaflavin system are supplied by the shikimate pathway. A hypothetical mechanism for the assembly of the deazaflavin chromophore from 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2153630439,"Mitochondrial gene expression has been investigated in synaptic endings from rat cerebral cortex isolated at various stages during the postnatal development and maturation of the animal. The pattern of the mitochondrial translation products labeled in vitro in rat brain synaptosomes revealed some distinctive features when compared with the pattern observed in a rat fibroblast cell line, the most remarkable being the apparent absence of labeling of the ND5 product. This absence contrasted with the presence in synaptosomes of an amount of ND5 mRNA comparable with that found in the rat fibroblast cell line. The rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis per unit amount of mtDNA in brain synaptosomes showed a characteristic reproducible burst at 10-13 days after birth, thereafter declining sharply in the 3rd week to reach a level that remained constant over a 2-year period. The postnatal burst of mitochondrial protein synthesis coincided with a sharp increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity, pointing to a phase of rapid assembly of respiratory complexes. A comparison of the levels of mitochondrial mRNAs with the corresponding rates of protein synthesis during the animal development and maturation showed a lack of correlation. These observations, together with the apparent lack of translation of the ND5 mRNA, indicate that translational control plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression in rat brain synaptic mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1638291624,"Tryptophanase (tryptophan: indole-lyase) from Escherichia coli has been isolated in the holoenzyme form and its absorption spectra and acid-base chemistry have been reevaluated. Apoenzyme has been prepared by dialysis against sodium phosphate and L-alanine and molar absorptivities of the coenzyme bands have been estimated by readdition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The spectrophotometric titration curve, whose midpoint is at pH 7.6 in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffers, indicates some degree of cooperativity in dissociation of a pair of protons. Resolution of the computed spectra of individual ionic forms of the enzyme with lognormal distribution curves shows that band shapes are similar to those of model Schiff bases and of aspartate aminotransferase. Using molar areas from the latter we estimated amounts of individual tautomeric species. In addition to ketoenamine and enolimine or covalent adduct the high pH form also appears to contain approximately 18% of a species with a dipolar ionic ring (protonated on the ring nitrogen and with phenolate -O-). We suggest that this may be the catalytically active form of the coenzyme in tryptophanase. The equilibrium between tryptophanase and L-alanine has also been reevaluated."

The acidic polysaccharides secreted by the Rhizobium were isolated from the culture media and purified. The polysaccharides were cleaved with a bacteriophage enzyme and the octasaccharide repeating units formed were isolated. The glycosyl sequence and type of nonglycosyl substituents of the repeating units derived from a number of these Rhizobium biovars were shown by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) to be identical. Minor variations in the degree of esterification of the repeating units by O-acetyl and O-(3-hydroxybutanoyl) substituents were observed when the Rhizobium were grown in the presence or absence of the flavonoids. The variation in content and the points of attachment of the O-acetyl and O-(3-hydroxybutanoyl) substituents were as great within each Rhizobium biovar as between different Rhizobium biovars and, contrary to two recent reports (Philip-Hollingsworth, S., Hollingsworth, R. I., and Dazzo, F. B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1461-1466; Philip-Hollingsworth, S., Hollingsworth, R. I., Dazzo, F. B., Djordjevic, M. A., and Rolfe, B. G. (1989) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1604025169,"Activation of hGH-1 expression is mediated by the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-I/Pit-I which binds the 5'-flanking DNA at two sites: I (-96/-70) and II (-134/-106). Although the factor(s) which direct the placental-specific expression of hCS-1 are not known, hCS-1 sequences are transcriptionally active in pituitary cells. In the present study we examined the effects of sequence differences between hGH-1 and hCS-1 5'-flanking DNAs in determining their basal and thyroid hormone-regulated promoter activities. We showed that Sp1 is a major determinant of both hGH-1 and hCS-1 promoter activities and that in hGH-1, binding and activation by Sp1 are modulated by interference from GHF-I/Pit-1 binding at the adjacent site II sequence. A single base which differed in site II of hCS-1 greatly reduced GHF-1/Pit-1 binding and thus facilitated binding and activation by Sp1. Further differences in promoter activity of hGH-1 and hCS-1 sequences were accounted for by a thyroid hormone-responsive element between -62/-48 in the hCS-1 gene. However, induction by T3 was independent of either Sp1 or GH-1/Pit-1 binding in the site II region. These data demonstrate that a small number of base changes between hGH and hCS promoter sequences subserve a number of mechanisms which may differentially modulate the expression of hGH and hCS genes."

Formation of inclusion bodies during synthesis of the E. aerogenes enzyme was avoided by cooling the culture and inducing at 25 degrees C. The cloned enzymes were produced in amounts three to four times those present in the fully induced native hosts and were identical in properties to those isolated earlier (Guirard, B. M., and Snell, E. E. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 3963-3968). The two enzymes showed 85% sequence identity and also showed 80% sequence identity with the previously sequenced (Vaaler, G. L., Brasch, M. A., and Snell, E. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11010-11014) HisDCase of Morganella morganii. Nevertheless, antibodies to the M. morganii HisDCase do not cross-react with these enzymes suggesting that the regions of amino acid variations are located on the outer surface of the proteins. All three HisDCases are the same length (377 amino acid residues); encoded N-terminal methionine was completely removed in each case. These closely related pyridoxal-P enzymes show no sequence homology with the pyruvoyl-dependent HisDCases of Gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1533541966,"Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes possess a binding site for guanine nucleotides. GTP binds in unit stoichiometry and with high affinity (Kd = 15.3 +/- 2.8 nM) to the small subunit of bovine mitochondrial ribosomes. This binding activity survives high salt washes, indicating that the nucleotide binds to an integral site within this subunit. GDP also binds to the small subunit with high affinity (Kd = 17 +/- 5.8 nm) and in unit stoichiometry. The GTP binding activity can be competed with GDP but not appreciably by other nucleotides, indicating that both GTP and GDP bind specifically and to the same site. The non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP, guanylyl-5'-imidophosphate, and guanylyl-(beta,gamma-methylene)- diphosphonate also bind to the small subunit, but with reduced affinity. These results indicate that mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes, unlike other ribosomes, are able to interact directly with guanosine triphosphate, suggesting that the bound GTP may be involved in a novel regulatory mechanism in mitochondrial protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1594995799,"We have previously reported that relatively hydrophobic bile acids, decreased hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (reductase) activity whereas, hydrophilic bile acids had little effect on the enzyme. The purpose of the present study was to determine in more detail the mechanism of down-regulation of hepatic reductase activity by hydrophobic bile salts. Groups of rats were fed bile acids of differing hydrophobicity: ursodeoxycholic, cholic (CA), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), deoxycholic (DCA), or cholesterol for 14 days. Reductase specific activities and concentrations of reductase protein were determined in hepatic microsomes. Quantitation of levels of reductase mRNA was performed using Northern and dot blot hybridization. Reductase gene transcriptional activity (nuclear run-on) was determined in nuclei isolated from livers of animals fed different bile acids. Hydrophobic bile acids and cholesterol significantly decreased reductase activity: CA (57%), CDCA (77%), DCA (73%), cholesterol (89%), and reductase protein levels as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method were also decreased; CA (27%), CDCA (31%), DCA (42%), and cholesterol (35%). Reductase mRNA levels were also decreased after feeding hydrophobic bile acid: CA (43%), CDCA (47%), DCA (54%), and cholesterol (53%). Ursodeoxycholic, a hydrophilic bile acid, caused a much smaller decrease in reductase activity (18%), protein mass (16%), and mRNA levels (10%). Decreased transcriptional activities were observed in CA- and cholesterol-fed rats. Surprisingly, CDCA- and DCA-fed animals showed transcriptional activities similar to control animals even though steady state mRNA levels were low in CDCA- and DCA-fed animals. We hypothesize a post-transcriptional regulation of reductase mRNA by hydrophobic bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W1541368655,"Vitamin B12 (hydroxycobalamin) is endocytosed by mammalian cells as a complex with transcobalamin II and then processed to free B12 in lysosomes. The mechanism by which free B12 becomes available for subsequent cellular metabolism has been uncertain. Lysosomal transport of cyanocobalamin (B12) was examined using membrane vesicles prepared from Percoll gradient purified lysosomes. B12 uptake by vesicles was dependent upon pH and was inhibited by the protonophore CCCP. Transport exhibited saturation kinetics with a Km of 3.5 microM and temperature dependence with a Q10 of 1.8. Uptake of B12 was dependent upon divalent cations and was inhibited by EDTA. Preparation of vesicles in the presence of 100 microM B12 resulted in stimulation of uptake consistent with a mechanism of countertransport. Excess cyanocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, or cobinamide dicyanide inhibited uptake of B12. Trans-stimulation studies showed that only the first three compounds are actually transported species with cyanocobalamin as the preferred substrate. We conclude that lysosomes have a specific transport system for vitamin B12 that results in release of this enzyme cofactor to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1556184133,"Ca2+ binding to rabbit skeletal calsequestrin was studied at physiological ionic strength by equilibrium flow dialysis, Hummel-Dryer gel filtration and microcalorimetry. 31 Ca(2+)-binding sites with a mean dissociation constant (KD) of 0.79 mM were titrated in the absence, and 23 sites with a KD of 0.88 mM in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+. No cooperativity was observed. For Mg2+ binding, the combination of gel filtration and microcalorimetry yielded a stoichiometry of 26 Mg2+/protein with a KD of 2mM. 1 mM Ca2+ decreased the stoichiometry to 20 Mg2+/protein. Binding of Ca2+ in the absence and presence of 3 mM Mg2+ was accompanied by a release of 2.0 and 2.7 H+/protein, respectively. Mg2+ binding did not lead to a significant proton release suggesting a qualitative difference in the Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-binding sites. After correction for proton release, the enthalpy change for Ca2+ binding was very low (-1.5 kJ/protein in the absence, and -15 kJ/protein in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+). The entropy change (+59 J/K.site in the absence and +56 J/K.site in the presence of Mg2+) was therefore virtually the sole driving force for Ca2+ binding. Mg2+ binding is slightly more exothermic (-12.6 kJ/protein), but as for Ca2+, the entropy change (+50 J/K.site) constituted the major driving force of the reaction. A fluorimetric study indicates that the conformation of tryptophan in Mg(2+)-saturated calsequestrin was clearly different from that in the Ca(2+)-saturated protein, but that the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-saturated protein was not distinct from the Ca(2+)-saturated protein. Thus, in addition to the thermodynamic characterization of the Ca2+/calsequestrin interaction, our data indicate that Ca2+ and Mg2+ do not bind to the same sites on calsequestrin. The data also predict considerable proton fluxes upon Ca(2+)-Mg2+ exchange in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1483742682,"We previously identified a 300-base pair long enhancer, located 3.6 kilobases upstream of the cap site of the human transferrin gene. A 5' deletion up to position 86 of the enhancer resulted in complete loss of the enhancer activity. Here we show by competition footprint analysis, gel retardation assays, and transient expression studies in hepatoma and HeLa cells that the enhancer is composed of two distinct structural and functional domains, A (nucleotides 1-86) and B (nucleotides 87-291). Each domain is a proto-enhancer of a different type. Domain A is a proto-enhancer that, when multimerized, is able by itself to stimulate transcription from the heterologous SV40 promoter, both in Hep3B and HeLa cells. It contains the octanucleotide TGTTTGCT sequence and is the binding site of two liver-specific nuclear factors and of a different HeLa nuclear factor. Domain B contains four binding sites interacting with several liver nuclear proteins. In order to bind, any of these proteins requires the presence of all the others. This domain is able to block the activity of a downstream negative element, but it has no enhancer activity by itself. In the presence of the transferrin promoter, full enhancer activity requires the association of the two domains A and B."
https://openalex.org/W1594517655,"The apoC-III promoter region -86 to -74 is recognized by two nuclear factors designated CIIIB1 and CIIIB2 (NF-BA1) which are both activators of apoC-III gene transcription (Ogami, K., Hadzopoulou-Cladaras, M., Cladaras, C., and Zannis, V. I. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9808-9815). In this communication we report the purification of factor CIIIB1 from rat liver nuclear extracts. The purification procedure included anion- and cation-exchange chromatography, DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography, and heat treatment at 85 degrees C for 5 min. The ligand used for affinity chromatography was a mutated apoC-III -90 to -73 promoter sequence which binds only the CIIIB1 factor. The purified protein was identified as a poly-peptide of Mr 41,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and photoaffinity cross-linking. The binding site of CIIIB1, defined by DNase I footprinting and methylation interference assays, contains the octameric motif CAGGTGAC. Nucleotide substitutions within this sequence abolished the binding of the purified factor. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that purified CIIIB1 protein protects the apoA-II promoter region -65 to -48 which contains an identical octameric CAGGTGAC motif in the antisense strand suggesting that CIIIB1 may also play a role in apoA-II gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1485160581,"By using near-UV circular dichroism (CD) and solvent proton nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements, three different conformational states have been detected in Ca(2+)-Mn(2+)-concanavalin A upon binding a variety of asparagine-linked carbohydrates. Two of these transitions have been described previously, one for the binding of monosaccharides such as methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside and oligosaccharides with terminal alpha-Glc or alpha-Man residues, and the second for the binding of oligomannose and complex type carbohydrates (Brewer, C. F., and Bhattacharyya, L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7306-7310). The third transition occurs upon binding a bisected biantennary complex type carbohydrate with terminal GlcNAc residues. Temperature-dependent nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion and CD measurements have identified regions of the protein near the two metal ion binding sites that are associated with the conformation changes, and Tyr-12, which is part of the monosaccharide binding site, as responsible for the CD changes. The results support our previous conclusions that the rotamer conformation of the (alpha 1,6) arm of bisected complex type oligosaccharides binds to concanavalin A with dihedral angle omega = -60 degrees whereas nonbisected complex type oligosaccharides bind with omega = 180 degrees (Bhattacharyya, L., Haraldsson, M., and Brewer, C. F. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1294-1299). The present findings also explain the effects of increasing chain length of bisected complex type carbohydrates on their interactions with the lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1572031990,"The 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMHs) of human erythrocyte glucose transporter were individually cut by pepsin digestion as membrane-bound 2.5-3.5-kDa peptide fragments. Radiation-induced chemical degradation of these fragments showed an average target size of 34 kDa. This is 10-12 x larger than the average size of an individual TMH, demonstrating that a significant energy transfer occurs among these TMHs in the absence of covalent linkage. Heating this TMH preparation at 100 degrees C for 15 min reduced the target size to 5 kDa or less, suggesting that the noncovalent energy transfer requires specific helix-helix interactions. Purified phospholamban, a small (6-kDa) integral membrane protein containing a single TMH, formed a pentameric assembly in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The chemical degradation target size of this phospholamban pentamer was 5-6 kDa, illustrating that not all integral membrane protein assemblies permit intersubunit energy transfer. These findings together with other published observations suggest strongly that significant noncovalent energy transfer can occur within the tertiary and quaternary structure of membrane proteins and that as yet undefined proper molecular interactions are required for such covalent energy transfer. Our results with pepsin-digested glucose transporter also illustrate the importance of the interhelical interaction as a predominating force in maintaining the tertiary structure of a transmembrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1596855747,"The cDNA sequences encoding mature and precursor forms of human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) were expressed in Escherichia coli using a lambda PL promoter-driven prokaryotic expression vector. The expressed proteins in total cell extracts were identified by Western blot analysis using anti-pig heart E3 antibody and also by measurement of E3 activity. Most of the expressed human E3 polypeptides (five bands) were found in the insoluble pellet while primarily full-length mature E3 was found in the soluble fraction. About 2% of the total soluble protein was mature human E3 when expressed in wild type E. coli AR120. Since wild type E. coli has its own endogenous E3 activity, the expression of human E3 was performed in a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-deficient strain of E. coli, JRG1342. The expressed recombinant human E3s in JRG1342 were purified to near homogeneity. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the recombinant mature E3 had an expected sequence while the recombinant precursor E3 lost 19 amino acid residues of its 35-amino acid leader sequence presumably due to a proteolytic cleavage. The recombinant mature E3 displayed comparable kinetic properties to those reported for highly purified mammalian E3s. The truncated precursor E3 showed about half of the mature E3 activity. The double-reciprocal plot for the mature E3 in the direction of NAD+ reduction showed parallel lines (ping-pong mechanism) while that for the truncated precursor E3 displayed intersecting lines (sequential mechanism). In the direction of NADH oxidation, the kinetic mechanisms of both E3s were apparently a ping-pong mechanism. These kinetic results showed that the partial 16-amino acid extension in the leader sequence changed the kinetic mechanism of human E3 so that it resembled that of glutathione reductase."

SF9 insect cells were infected with the recombinant viruses containing hCG alpha and hCG beta cDNAs in selenomethionine containing methionine-free Grace's medium. The selenomethionyl hCG (SehCG) was purified from the culture medium by one step immunoaffinity chromatography using an immobilized monoclonal antibody against hCG beta. The presence of selenomethionine was demonstrated by amino acid analysis of SehCG. The amino acid composition indicated that more than 84% of methionine residues were substituted by selenomethionine. Its sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis yielded a single 38-kDa protein band under nonreducing conditions. The carbohydrate analysis of SehCG was consistent with the presence of four N-linked high mannose type carbohydrates and four O-linked simple disaccharide chains. The in vitro immunological and biological studies of SehCG indicated that selenomethionine substitution had no effect on the immunopotency, receptor binding, and steroidogenic activities of the hormone."

Beside a site indicative of the chromosomal background, these strains have one site of O-acetylation in common, namely residue b of the repeating unit. The O-acetyl esterification pattern of EPS of the Sym plasmid-cured derivatives of strains LPR5, ANU843, and 248 was not altered by the introduction of a R. leguminosarum bv. viciae Sym plasmid or a R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii Sym plasmid. The induction of nod gene expression by growth of the bacteria in the presence of Vicia sativa plants or by the presence of the flavonoid naringenin, produced no significant changes in either amount or sites of O-acetyl substitution. Furthermore, no such changes were found in the EPS from a Rhizobium strain in which the nod genes are constitutively expressed. The substitution pattern of the exopolysaccharide from R. leguminosarum is, therefore, determined by the bacterial genome and is not influenced by genes present on the Sym plasmid. This conclusion is inconsistent with the suggestion of Philip-Hollingsworth et al. (Philip-Hollingsworth, S., Hollingsworth, R. I., Dazzo, F. B., Djordjevic, M. A., and Rolfe, B. G. (1989) J. Biol.

Both one- and two-chain high molecular weight urokinases exhibited a radius of gyration of 31 A and a maximum dimension of 90 A. Neither parameter was affected by the presence of lysine sufficient to saturate all the lysine-binding sites in human plasminogen. These physical parameters are consistent with the sedimentation coefficient of high molecular weight urokinase and indicate that both proteins are highly asymmetric. Neither protein contained much alpha-helix or parallel beta-sheet. Most of the secondary structure was in the form of antiparallel beta-sheet and beta-turns, very similar to the secondary structure of plasminogen. The macroscopic kinetic constants, Km and kcat, for the hydrolysis of (pyroGlu-Gly-Arg-NH)2-rhodamine by two-chain high molecular weight urokinase and low molecular weight urokinase which lacks the epidermal growth factor and kringle domains were similar. These structural and kinetic data are consistent with the domains in both forms of urokinase being independent structural and functional units."
https://openalex.org/W1593994985,"We describe a new technique for analysis of proteins located near fluorescent lipid analogs in intact living cells using the membrane-permeant, photoactivatable probe, 5-[125I]iodonaphthyl-1-azide ([125I]INA). [125I] INA can be activated directly with UV light or indirectly through excitation of adjacent fluorophores (photosensitizers) with visible light to modify nearby proteins covalently with 125I. In this report we demonstrate that fluorescent phospholipids and sphingolipids containing N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-6-aminocaproic acid serve as appropriate photosensitizers for [125I]INA. Using Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts, we optimized the labeling conditions with respect to lipid concentration and time of irradiation and then examined the profiles of cellular proteins that were labeled when fluorescent analogs of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidic acid were used as photosensitizers in living cells. The use of different fluorescent lipids, which label different subcellular compartments of cells as determined by fluorescence microscopy, derivatized different sets of cellular proteins with 125I. The labeled proteins were subsets of the total set of proteins available for derivatization as determined by direct activation of [125I]INA. Most proteins labeled by this procedure were pelleted by centrifugation of cell lysates at high speed (260,000 x g), but several soluble proteins were also labeled under these conditions. The implications of using this technique for identification of compartment-specific proteins and proteins involved in lipid metabolism and transport are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561846665,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been utilized to examine the nature of the interaction of the histidine-binding protein (HisJ) with the membrane-bound components of the histidine transport system. In order to examine a region of the HisJ protein involved in the interaction with the membrane components, a number of charged amino acids in the vicinity of the genetically isolated interaction mutant hisJ5625 (R176C) were mutated. It was found that residues Asp171, Arg176, and Asp178 could be independently altered without affecting the histidine-binding affinity of the HisJ protein. However, the alteration of residues Asp171 and Arg176 greatly reduced the interaction of the HisJ protein with the membrane protein complex, whereas altering residue Asp178 had no effect on this interaction. Simultaneously, altering residues Asp183 and Glu184 resulted in a completely defective protein. The ability of a his-J5625 suppressor HisP protein (HisP(T205A)) to suppress the newly created site-directed mutants was also examined. This suppressor demonstrated specificity toward the amino acid present at position 176 and was also able the suppress the mutation created at position 171."

This is followed by a stage during which Nph3 and Ala2-amide are the major products. A small amount of Nph4 is also formed during this time. Nph and Nph2, formed during the reactions, are tightly, but probably not covalently, bound to the enzyme. They appear as free products only as a result of the cleavage of Nph3 and Nph4 and after most of the substrate Nph-Ala2-amide has been used up. They act as acceptors for the substrate and for Nph2-Ala2-amide. Nph3-Ala2-amide, formed by condensation of Nph-Ala2-amide or of Nph2-Ala2-amide with enzyme-bound Nph2 or Nph, respectively, is also released but is cleaved rapidly to give Nph3 and Ala2-amide. Incorporation of 18O from [18O]water into the carbonyl oxygens of the products is extensive and shows that release of the intermediates is slower than peptide bond cleavage and peptide bond formation. Hence the rate-limiting step in these reactions is product release. No 18O is incorporated into the initial substrate. We propose that Nph and Nph2 as intermediates are held in the active site by hydrogen bonds and by two strong electrostatic interactions."
