https://openalex.org/W2889513238,"Expanding the targeting space of Cas9 CRISPR-Cas9 associates with a guide RNA to target and cleave a specific DNA site next to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), the one most often used for genome editing, only recognizes the NGG sequence (where N is any nucleobase) as the PAM, which restricts regions in the genome that can be targeted. To address this limitation, Nishimasu et al. created a SpCas9 variant that recognizes NG rather than NGG. The SpCas9-NG variant increased the targeting range, had a specificity similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, and could be used with a base editor. Thus, SpCas9-NG is a powerful addition to the CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering toolbox and will be useful in a broad range of applications, from basic research to clinical therapeutics.

Deutsch et al. show that this effect may be exacerbated by insect pests (see the Perspective by Riegler). Insects already consume 5 to 20% of major grain crops. The authors' models show that for the three most important grain crops—wheat, rice, and maize—yield lost to insects will increase by 10 to 25% per degree Celsius of warming, hitting hardest in the temperate zone. These findings provide an estimate of further potential climate impacts on global food supply and a benchmark for future regional and field-specific studies of crop-pest-climate interactions.

However, technological barriers owing to the small amount of material present in each single cell have prevented parallel analyses. Cao et al. present sci-CAR, a pooled barcode method that jointly analyzes both the RNA transcripts and chromatin profiles of single cells. By applying sci-CAR to lung adenocarcinoma cells and mouse kidney tissue, the authors demonstrate precision in assessing expression and genome accessibility at a genome-wide scale. The approach provides an improvement over bulk analysis, which can be confounded by differing cellular subgroups. Science , this issue p. 1380"

The disease is caused by mutations that reduce or prevent expression of dystrophin, an essential structural protein in skeletal and heart muscle. The gene editing technology CRISPR-Cas9 can correct disease-causing mutations and has yielded promising results in mouse models of DMD. In a small, short-term study, Amoasii et al. tested this strategy in a dog model of DMD that exhibits many features of the human disease. Intramuscular or systemic delivery of the gene editing components resulted in a substantial increase in dystrophin protein levels in skeletal and heart muscle. Restoration of dystrophin expression was accompanied by improved muscle histology. Science , this issue p. 86"
https://openalex.org/W2888971284,"A fundamental challenge of biology is to understand the vast heterogeneity of cells, particularly how cellular composition, structure, and morphology are linked to cellular physiology. Unfortunately, conventional technologies are limited in uncovering these relations. We present a machine-intelligence technology based on a radically different architecture that realizes real-time image-based intelligent cell sorting at an unprecedented rate. This technology, which we refer to as intelligent image-activated cell sorting, integrates high-throughput cell microscopy, focusing, and sorting on a hybrid software-hardware data-management infrastructure, enabling real-time automated operation for data acquisition, data processing, decision-making, and actuation. We use it to demonstrate real-time sorting of microalgal and blood cells based on intracellular protein localization and cell-cell interaction from large heterogeneous populations for studying photosynthesis and atherothrombosis, respectively. The technology is highly versatile and expected to enable machine-based scientific discovery in biological, pharmaceutical, and medical sciences."

Characterization of genome structures necessitates single-cell measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging amplification), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact. We reconstructed the genome structures of single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and the two X chromosomes were structurally different. Cells of different types displayed statistically distinct genome structures. Such structural cell typing is crucial for understanding cell functions."

Han et al. fabricated a two-terminal tandem cell with an inorganicorganic hybrid perovskite top layer and a Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 (CIGS) bottom layer. Control of the roughness of the CIGS surface and the use of a heavily doped organic hole transport layer were crucial to achieve a 22.4% power conversion efficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2888856613,"Impacts of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems are imperfectly constrained by ecosystem models and direct observations. Pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and associated climatic changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition, which was comparable in magnitude to warming projected for the next century under high-emission scenarios. We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity."

However, it remains unclear how far away from an injection site an earthquake can still be triggered. Goebel and Brodsky looked at 18 different earthquake-producing injection sites around the world to address this issue. Injecting fluid into softer layers increased the range for seismic hazard, whereas harder basement rock better confined the fluid.

https://openalex.org/W2889019609,"Looping together genes in cancer A subset of human cancers are characterized by aberrant fusion of two specific genes. In some cases, the activity of the resultant fusion protein drives tumor growth. Most fusion genes in cancer appear to arise from simple reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Anderson et al. found that the characteristic fusion gene in a bone and soft tissue tumor called Ewing sarcoma is produced by a far more complicated mechanism (see the Perspective by Imielinski and Ladanyi). In nearly half of the tumors examined, the fusion gene was created by the formation of dramatic genomic loops that disrupt multiple genes. These complex rearrangements occur in early replicating and transcriptionally active regions of the genome and are associated with poor prognosis. Science , this issue p. eaam8419 ; see also p. 848"
https://openalex.org/W2889007489,"Dynamics of cell signaling and decoding Defects in cellular signaling pathways, like those in some cancer cells, are often thought to result in increased or decreased steady-state signals that promote or inhibit cell proliferation. But Bugaj et al. show that dynamic changes in the duration or frequency of a signal can also alter cellular responses (see the Perspective by Kolch and Kiel). They took precise control of signaling in cultured human or mouse cells with a light-controlled mechanism for activating and inactivating the guanosine triphosphate Ras. Known cancer mutations in components of the Ras-activated signaling pathway or inhibitors of particular pathway components altered signal timing and readouts. The modified dynamics changed transcriptional outcomes and could inappropriately support cell proliferation. The ability to probe responses of signaling networks in this way may enhance understanding of biological regulation and reveal new therapeutic targets.

https://openalex.org/W3105587074,"In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum oscillations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here we report a notable exception in an insulator, ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB12). Despite much larger than that of metals, the resistivity of YbB12 exhibits profound quantum oscillations. This unconventional oscillation is shown to arise from the insulating bulk, yet the temperature dependence of their amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals. The large effective masses indicate the presence of Fermi surface consisting of strongly correlated electrons. Our result reveals a mysterious bipartite ground state of YbB12: it is both a charge insulator and a strongly correlated metal."

Therefore, the study aimed at developing carvedilol (CVD) in SLNs to control its release and enhance its bioavailability in the management of hypertension, and cardiac diseases. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied to optimize the variables affecting the quality of CVD-SLNs which prepared by homogenization-ultrasonication technique. The concentrations of Percirol (X1), Gelucire (X2), and stearylamine (X3) were chosen as the crucial independent variables. The dependent variables were estimated and analyzed by Statgraphics software to achieve the optimum characteristics of the developed SLNs. The optimized SLNs was evaluated in vitro and in vivo for pharmacokinetic parameters on male New Zealand white rabbits. The results of this study revealed that the CVD-SLNs have a colloidal size of 31.3 nm with zeta potential of 24.25 mV indicating good stability and 91.43% entrapment efficiency. The in vitro release of CVD from the SLNs was best fitted to Hixon-Crowell model that describes the release from the particles with uniform size. The in vivo pharmacokinetics results indicated the prolongation in the mean residence time of CVD to 23 h when delivered in SLNs and its oral bioavailability enhanced by more than 2-folds."

Here, we examined the role of the transcriptional regulator NF-κB in EMT of primary human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs). Surprisingly, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) activated NF-κB/RELA proto-oncogene, NF-κB subunit (RELA) translocation within 1 day of stimulation, yet induction of its downstream gene regulatory network occurred only after 3 days. A time course of TGFβ-induced EMT transition was analyzed by RNA-Seq in the absence or presence of inducible shRNA-mediated silencing of RELA. In WT cells, TGFβ stimulation significantly affected the expression of 2,441 genes. Gene set enrichment analysis identified WNT, cadherin, and NF-κB signaling as the most prominent TGFβ-inducible pathways. By comparison, RELA controlled expression of 3,138 overlapping genes mapping to WNT, cadherin, and chemokine signaling pathways. Conducting upstream regulator analysis, we found that RELA controls six clusters of upstream transcription factors, many of which overlapped with a transcription factor topology map of EMT developed earlier. RELA triggered expression of three key EMT pathways: 1) the WNT/β-catenin morphogen pathway, 2) the JUN transcription factor, and 3) the Snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1). RELA binding to target genes was confirmed by ChIP. Experiments independently validating WNT dependence on RELA were performed by silencing RELA via genome editing and indicated that TGFβ-induced WNT5B expression and downstream activation of the WNT target AXIN2 are RELA-dependent. We conclude that RELA is a master transcriptional regulator of EMT upstream of WNT morphogen, JUN, SNAI1–ZEB1, and interleukin-6 autocrine loops.

https://openalex.org/W2889441374,"The number of smartphone users globally is rapidly increasing. This study aimed to assess the level of ergonomic risk to smartphone users, and to evaluate the correlation between any self-reported musculoskeletal disorders and the level of ergonomic risk. Thirty participants completed a questionnaire, tailored specifically for smartphone users, to determine any musculoskeletal disorders. Participants were given a seated smartphone texting task and their postures were video recorded during the task. The video scenarios were evaluated by three independent researchers to determine the level of ergonomic risk using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) tool. RULA is an observation-based screening tool which has been widely used to assess the postural risk of IT device users. However, it has not yet been specifically utilized with smartphone users. The RULA tool scores identified ergonomics risks from using smartphones to text. Most smartphone users had a total RULA Grand Score of 6 for both sides (left side: 80.00%, right side: 90.00%), indicating the need for further investigation and changes (Action Level 3). Notably, no participants had acceptable RULA Grand Scores of 1 or 2. The correlation between musculoskeletal disorders and the ergonomic risk among smartphone users was determined using the Chi-Square test and Fisher's exact test; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. There was a significant correlation between right RULA Grand Score and neck musculoskeletal disorder (χ2 = 9.424 at p value = 0.009) and right RULA Grand Score and upper back musculoskeletal disorder (χ2 = 31.717 at p value <0.001). RULA Score B (combination of neck, trunk and leg postures) and RULA Score D (combination of Score B, muscle use and force scores for group B) were also significantly correlated with neck musculoskeletal disorders (χ2 = 19.286 at p value<0.001 and χ2 = 9.310 at p value = 0.002 respectively). The RULA results identified the high ergonomics risk of smartphone users, this resulted from two key risk factors: posture and muscle use. The neck, trunk and leg postures had a combined effect on neck musculoskeletal disorders. Future investigations should consider these factors when designing ergonomic interventions for smartphone users."

Little is known about the relative importance of PAD2 and PAD4 in generating citrullinated self-antigens. Here we investigate the ability of PAD2 and PAD4 to generate citrullinated targets for ACPAs in four human proteins. Methods Synovial fluid (SF) and plasma were collected from 42 RA patients. Human fibrinogen, human alpha-enolase (ENO1), human histone H3, and human serum albumin (HSA) were citrullinated in vitro by PAD2 or PAD4. The total degree of citrullination was determined using the anti-modified citrulline approach. Antibody binding to native and citrullinated proteins was measured by ELISA. Results ACPAs within pooled SF from multiple RA patients reacted equally well with, and cross-reacted with, PAD2- and PAD4-citrullinated fibrinogen. ACPAs from most individual patient SF and plasma samples bound equally well to PAD2- and PAD4-citrullinated fibrinogen or ENO1. When histone H3 was used as target, PAD4 was generally superior in generating epitopes recognized by ACPAs. No binding to citrullinated HSA was observed. Conclusion In most patients, PAD2 and PAD4 are equally efficient in generating citrullinated target sites for ACPAs in fibrinogen and ENO1. The binding of autoantibodies to histone H3 was generally higher after citrullination with PAD4 than with PAD2. Citrullinated HSA is not a target for ACPAs."

This study evaluated the physical and biological properties of a denture base acrylic resin after immersion in antiseptic soaps. Acrylic resin specimens were prepared and stored in distinct solutions for 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. The solutions were as follows: DW: distilled water at 37°C (control group); DS: cycles of daily immersion in Dettol soap for 8 hours at room temperature, followed by immersion in distilled water for 16 hours at 37°C; PS: cycles of daily immersion in Protex soap, as described for the previous group; LS: cycles of daily immersion in Lifebuoy soap, as described for the DS group. The parameters evaluated at each time point were the following: biofilm formation capacity by Candida albicans and reduction of preformed fungal biofilms, cytotoxicity, surface roughness, hardness, and color change. For the fungal adhesion phase, the type of soap had a statistically significant effect (p = 0.0292), but after 24 hours, no differences were found between solutions or between storage times. Regarding the efficacy of biofilm reduction, there was a significant difference when the groups were compared to each other (p = 0.014). Dettol and Lifebuoy eliminated the preformed biofilm on the specimens. Moreover, all the soaps were classified as non-cytotoxic (on HaCaT cell line) because there was no difference in cell viability between the different groups, except after 21 days, when a decrease in cell viability occurred, regardless of the type of soap. Regarding the roughness, there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between the groups. Lifebuoy decreased resin hardness regardless of storage time (p = 0.003). After 21 and 28 days of storage, there was an increase in hardness value, regardless of the type of soap. The specimens’ color, according to the National Bureau of Standards values, ranged from 0.27 to 0.58 (i.e., imperceptible or mild color changes). In general, the disinfectant soaps were not able to prevent biofilm formation, but all the soaps were effective in reducing the preformed biofilm. In addition, all soaps were non-cytotoxic and did not change surface roughness, hardness (except Lifebuoy), and color (except Lifebuoy). Therefore, immersion in two antiseptic soaps (Protex and Dettol) may be a cheap and easy procedure for preventing denture stomatitis."

Herein, we aimed to analyze the impact of iron deficiency (ID) in a real-life PH patient cohort according to different currently used ID definitions. In a retrospective study including 153 precapillary PH patients followed over a mean period of five years, iron deficiency was assessed according to five clinical definitions used in previous trials. The impact of ID on clinical, hematological and hemodynamic parameters was investigated. Depending on the different cutoff levels for serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, currently used ID definitions indicated a prevalence of either true or functional ID in 11 to 75 percent of PH patients. A good diagnostic accuracy was achieved by using the sTFRF/log ferritin (sTFRF) index, which identified 33 to 42 percent of PH patients as being iron deficient. The sTFRF index had the best prediction for the association between ID and clinical outcome. Iron deficient patients with precapillary PH had a significantly higher mortality as compared to non-iron deficiency subjects, which was true for both, PH patients with and without anemia. Although levels of the iron hormone hepcidin were rather affected by ID than by inflammation, they were not associated with the clinical course or mortality of PH subjects. To conclude, ID had a significant impact on the clinical course of precapillary PH patients. The appropriate use of robust biomarkers to define ID is a prerequisite to further evaluate the role of ID and the potential benefit of iron supplementation in precapillary PH patients."

Although dual phosphorylation of the TXY motif is known to be critical for the activation of conventional MAPKs, the role of Ser189 phosphorylation in ERK3 activity and its function in cancer cells remain elusive. In this study, we revealed that activation loop phosphorylation is important for ERK3 in promoting cancer cell invasiveness, as the S189A mutation greatly decreased the ability of ERK3 to promote migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Interestingly, a catalytically inactive ERK3 mutant was still capable of increasing migration and invasion, although to a lesser extent compared with WT ERK3, suggesting that ERK3 promotes cancer cell invasiveness by both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms. To elucidate how the S189A mutation reduces the invasiveness-promoting ability of ERK3, we tested its effect on the kinase activity of ERK3 toward steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3), a recently identified substrate of ERK3 critical for cancer cell invasiveness.

Artisanal small-scale miners (ASGMs) use mercury in gold production, hence are at risk of mercury-induced organ dysfunction. Aim We determined the association between mercury exposure, thyroid function and work-related factors among artisanal small-scale gold miners in Bibiani- Ghana. Method We conveniently recruited 137 consenting male gold miners at their work site in Bibiani-Ghana, in a comparative cross-sectional study. Occupational activities and socio-demographic data of participants were collected using a questionnaire. Blood sample was analysed for total mercury and thyroid hormones. Results Overall, 58.4% (80/137) of the participants had blood mercury exceeding the occupational exposure threshold (blood mercury ≥5μg/L). T3(P<0.0001) and T4(P<0.0001) were significantly reduced among the exposed group compared to the non-exposed. TSH showed no significant variation between the exposed and non-exposed groups. Longer work duration (≥5years), gold amalgamation, gold smelting and sucking of excess mercury with the mouth were associated with increased odds of mercury exposure. Blood mercury showed negative correlation with T3(r = -0.29, P<0.0001), and T4(r = -0.69, P<0.0001) and positive correlation with work duration (r = 0.88, P<0.001). Even though a positive trend of association between blood mercury and TSH levels was recorded, it was not significant (r = 0.07, P = 0.4121) Conclusion Small scale miners in Bibiani are exposed to mercury above the occupational threshold which may affect thyroid hormone levels."

CD100 was demonstrated to play a relevant role in immune responses in various pathological processes and may be responsible for immune dysregulation during HIV-1 infection. We investigated the function of CD72/CD100, and PD-1/PDL-1 axes on T and B cells in HIV-infected individuals and in healthy individuals. We analyzed the frequencies and fluorescence intensities of these four markers on CD4+, CD8+ T and B cells. Marker expressions were increased during active HIV-1 infection. CD100 frequency on T cells was positively associated with the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on T cells from HIV-infected treatment-naïve individuals. In addition, the frequency of CD72-expressing T cells was associated with interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in HIV-infected treatment-naïve individuals. Our data suggest that the CD72/CD100 and PD-1/PD-L1 axes may jointly participate in dysregulation of immunity during HIV-1 infection and could partially explain the immune systems' hyper-activation and exhaustion."
https://openalex.org/W2889262977,"TNFα is a pleiotropic cytokine which fuels tumor cell growth, invasion, and metastasis in some malignancies, while in others it induces cytotoxic cell death. However, the molecular mechanism by which TNFα exerts its diverse effects on breast cancer subtypes remains elusive. Using in vitro assays and mouse xenografts, we show here that TNFα contributes to the aggressive properties of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines via upregulation of TNFAIP3(A20). In a striking contrast, TNFα induces a potent cytotoxic cell death in luminal (ER+) breast cancer cell lines which fail to upregulate A20 expression. Overexpression of A20 not only protects luminal breast cancer cell lines from TNFα-induced cell death via inducing HSP70-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway but also promotes a robust EMT/CSC phenotype by activating the pStat3-mediated inflammatory signaling. Furthermore, A20 overexpression in luminal breast cancer cells induces aggressive metastatic properties in mouse xenografts via generating a permissive inflammatory microenvironment constituted by granulocytic-MDSCs. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which A20 mediates pleiotropic effects of TNFα playing role in aggressive behaviors of TNBC subtype while its deficiency results in TNFα-induced apoptotic cell death in luminal breast cancer subtype."

Homeless HIV positive PWIDs in Delhi is a key population experiencing gaps in uptake of these services, especially the ART uptake which is reportedly far from 90%, UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 target to end the AIDS epidemic. Objective To assess the gaps and barriers in accessing the ART and OST services uptake among HIV positive homeless PWID in Delhi and to explore experiences and perspectives of the PWIDs and service providers. Methodology We used a convergent parallel mixed methods design which included a cross-sectional quantitative survey and a qualitative study. Two hundred thirty five homeless HIV positive PWID were interviewed and in-depth interviews were conducted with five PWIDs and nine health providers. Results While only 12% of PWIDs were on ART, 80% were availing OST services. The top individual, health system related and structural barriers for ART service access were insufficient and incorrect knowledge (63%), long waiting time (86%) and lack of family support (44%) respectively. Inconvenient timings, stringent registration requirements and negative attitude of health providers were expressed as major barriers of accessing ART services during the interviews while these were not a concern in OST services. Homelessness, poverty, stigma were common barriers for both services. Integrated, ‘single window’ service and provision of additional support like nutrition and shelter were suggested as measures to improve access by both health providers and the PWIDs themselves. Conclusion There is an urgent need for structural and health systems changes to improve access to ART and OST services. These include integrated service delivery, flexibility in timing of the centers, accelerated ART initiation, simplification of bureaucratic procedures, nutritional and social support to all homeless HIV positive PWIDs."
https://openalex.org/W2889440524,"Mitochondrial genes of Euglenozoa (Kinetoplastida, Diplonemea, and Euglenida) are notorious for being barely recognizable, raising the question of whether such divergent genes actually code for functional proteins. Here we demonstrate the translation and identify the function of five previously unassigned y genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of diplonemids. As is the rule in diplonemid mitochondria, y genes are fragmented, with gene pieces transcribed separately and then trans-spliced to form contiguous mRNAs. Further, y transcripts undergo massive RNA editing, including uridine insertions that generate up to 16-residue-long phenylalanine tracts, a feature otherwise absent from conserved mitochondrial proteins. By protein sequence analyses, MS, and enzymatic assays in Diplonema papillatum, we show that these y genes encode the subunits Nad2, -3, -4L, -6, and -9 of the respiratory chain Complex I (CI; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). The few conserved residues of these proteins are essentially those involved in proton pumping across the inner mitochondrial membrane and in coupling ubiquinone reduction to proton pumping (Nad2, -3, -4L, and -6) and in interactions with subunits containing electron-transporting Fe-S clusters (Nad9). Thus, in diplonemids, 10 CI subunits are mtDNA-encoded. Further, MS of D. papillatum CI allowed identification of 26 conventional and 15 putative diplonemid-specific nucleus-encoded components. Most conventional accessory subunits are well-conserved but unusually long, possibly compensating for the streamlined mtDNA-encoded components and for missing, otherwise widely distributed, conventional subunits. Finally, D. papillatum CI predominantly exists as a supercomplex I:III:IV that is exceptionally stable, making this protist an organism of choice for structural studies.

https://openalex.org/W2888970087,"Local drug delivery systems that adjust the release of immunosuppressive drug in response to the nature and intensity of inflammation represent a promising approach to reduce systemic immunosuppression and its side effects in allotransplantation. Here we aimed to demonstrate that release of tacrolimus from triglycerol monostearate hydrogel is inflammation-dependent in vivo. We further report that by loading the hydrogel with a near-infrared dye, it is possible to monitor drug release non-invasively in an in vivo model of vascularized composite allotransplantation.Inflammation was induced by local challenge with lipopolysaccharides in naïve rats 7 days after injection of tacrolimus-loaded hydrogel in the hind limb. Tacrolimus levels in blood and tissues were measured at selected time points. A near-infrared dye was encapsulated in the hydrogel together with tacrolimus in order to monitor hydrogel deposits and drug release in vitro and in vivo in a model of vascularized composite allotransplantation.Injection of lipopolysaccharides led to increased blood and skin tacrolimus levels (p = 0.0076, day 7 vs. day 12 in blood, and p = 0.0007 in treated limbs, 48 h after injection compared to controls). Moreover, lipopolysaccharides-injected animals had higher tacrolimus levels in treated limbs compared to contralateral limbs (p = 0.0003 for skin and p = 0.0053 for muscle). Imaging of hydrogel deposits and tacrolimus release was achieved by encapsulating near-infrared dye in the hydrogel for 160 days. The correlation of tacrolimus and near-infrared dye release from hydrogel was R2 = 0.6297 and R2 = 0.5619 in blood and grafts of transplanted animals respectively and R2 = 0.6066 in vitro.Here we demonstrate the inflammation-responsiveness of a tacrolimus-loaded hydrogel in vivo. Moreover, we show that encapsulating a near-infrared dye in the hydrogel provides a reliable correlation of tacrolimus and dye release from the hydrogel, and an accessible non-invasive method for monitoring drug release from hydrogel deposits."
https://openalex.org/W2888980427,"The use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays for pathogen detection in travelers' diarrhea (TD) field studies is limited by the on-site processing and storage requirements for fecal specimens. The objectives of this investigation were to i) characterize the pathogen distribution in deployed military personnel with TD using the TaqMan® Array Card PCR (TAC) on frozen stool and diarrheal smears on Whatman FTA Elute cards (FTA cards), and to ii) compare TAC detection of enteropathogen targets using smeared FTA cards and frozen stool, using TAC on frozen stool as the 'reference standard'. Stool samples, obtained from active duty personnel with acute TD enrolled in a field trial, were smeared onto FTA cards and stored at room temperature. A corresponding aliquot of stool was frozen in a cryovial. FTA cards and frozen stool samples were tested at a central lab, using a customized TAC for detection of TD pathogens. 187 paired frozen stool samples and smeared FTA cards were stored for a median of 712 days (IQR 396-750) before testing. Overall detection rates were 78.6% for frozen stool and 73.2% for FTA cards. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were the most common bacteria identified. Using the TAC results on frozen stool as the reference, the overall sensitivity and specificity of TAC on FTA cards was 72.9% and 98.0% respectively. TAC on FTA cards demonstrated a decrease in sensitivity with increasing frozen stool quantification cycle (Cq) (90.0% in FTA cards with a corresponding frozen stool Cq < 30, and 72.9% in samples with a corresponding frozen stool Cq < 35). Our findings support the use and further development of FTA cards in combination with a quantitative PCR assay for enteropathogen detection in TD field studies."

We examined data from 433 HIV positive pregnant women in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, enrolled between April 2013 and August 2014 and followed-up through 6 weeks postpartum. Participants were asked about their IPV experiences in a face-to-face interview at enrollment. Measures of PMTCT cascade included: uptake of clinical appointments and services, viral suppression, and adherence to antiretrovirals (ARV). Approximately half of the sample (51%) had experienced some form of IPV; 35% had experienced emotional abuse, 29% physical abuse, and 19% sexual abuse. There were no statistically significant associations between experiencing any form of IPV and uptake of clinical appointments and services (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR] = 1.02; 95% [CI]: 0.89–1.17), viral load suppression (aPR = 1.07, 95% CI:0.96–1.19) and ARV adherence (aPR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87–1.18). Findings from this study indicate that, among HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled in PMTCT care, experiencing IPV does not reduce adherence to clinic visits and services, adherence to ARV. The high prevalence of IPV in this population suggests that IPV screening and intervention should be included as part of standard care for PMTCT."

We propose that the dynamic nature of UL37 underlies its ability to perform diverse roles during viral replication. Herpesviridae are a large family of viruses that infect a broad range of hosts from mollusks to birds to humans. All herpesviruses are composed of a capsid containing the dsDNA genome surrounded by a layer of proteins called the tegument, which is enclosed by the glycoprotein-studded lipid envelope. The tegument layer is stabilized by extensive protein/protein interactions and is largely structurally maintained even once the viral membrane is removed (1.McLauchlan J. Rixon F.J. Characterization of enveloped tegument structures (L particles) produced by alphaherpesviruses: integrity of the tegument does not depend on the presence of capsid or envelope.J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73 (1311356): 269-27610.1099/0022-1317-73-2-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The tegument includes 23 distinct virally encoded proteins, in addition to several host proteins (2.Owen D.J. Crump C.M. Graham S.C.

The tegument is further subdivided into the inner and outer tegument. The inner tegument is directly associated with the capsid, and protein copy numbers are tightly controlled. The outer tegument is less ordered and associates with the viral envelope instead of the capsid (2.Owen D.J. Crump C.M. Graham S.C.

Other tegument proteins are involved in regulation of viral and host gene expression. For example, the outer tegument protein UL48, also known as α-transactivator, activates transcription of immediate-early viral genes (11.Campbell M.E. Palfreyman J.W. Preston C.M.

Another outer tegument protein, UL41, is an endonuclease that suppresses host protein expression by degrading mRNA and is commonly termed vhs (viral host shutoff) (12.Smiley J.R.

Beyond structure and assembly, UL37 homologs from HSV-1 and PRV have been shown to facilitate efficient capsid trafficking during both viral entry and egress. During entry into epithelial cells, HSV-1 and PRV viruses lacking UL37 are delayed in trafficking, with about 50% of capsids failing to reach the nucleus (13.Leege T. Granzow H. Fuchs W. Klupp B.G. Mettenleiter T.C. Phenotypic similarities and differences between UL37-deleted pseudorabies virus and herpes simplex virus type 1.J. Gen.

During egress, in the absence of UL37, HSV-1 and PRV capsids do not efficiently traffic from the nucleus to the sites of secondary envelopment (vesicles derived from Golgi (19.Turcotte S.

In HSV-1, UL37 has been shown to promote capsid transport on microtubules during egress in epithelial cells through its interaction with host trafficking protein dystonin/BPAG1a (23.Pasdeloup D. McElwee M. Beilstein F. Labetoulle M. Rixon F.J. Herpesvirus tegument protein pUL37 interacts with dystonin/BPAG1 to promote capsid transport on microtubules during egress.J.

UL37 plays an even more prominent role in capsid trafficking in neurons during infection with HSV-1 and PRV. UL37-null viruses are defective in retrograde movement from axon termini to the nucleus and avirulent in the mouse model of infection, demonstrating the importance of efficient capsid trafficking in viral replication (24.Richards A.L. Sollars P.J. Pitts J.D. Stults A.M. Heldwein E.E. Pickard G.E. Smith G.A.

Finally, HSV-1 UL37 manipulates the innate immune response by binding immune modulators TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (25.Liu X. Fitzgerald K. Kurt-Jones E. Finberg R. Knipe D.M. Herpesvirus tegument protein activates NF-κB signaling through the TRAF6 adaptor protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Binding of UL37 to TRAF6 leads to activation of transcription factor NF-κB, which subsequently localizes to the nucleus and turns on expression of immune response genes, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), presumably to increase transcription of early viral genes (25.Liu X. Fitzgerald K. Kurt-Jones E. Finberg R. Knipe D.M. Herpesvirus tegument protein activates NF-κB signaling through the TRAF6 adaptor protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sollars P.J. Pitts J.D. Stults A.M. Heldwein E.E. Pickard G.E. Smith G.A. The pUL37 tegument protein guides α-herpesvirus retrograde axonal transport to promote neuroinvasion.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 (29216315): e100674110.1371/journal.ppat.1006741Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, no structural information is yet available for the C-terminal domain of UL37 (UL37C) that mediates the majority of known interactions of UL37. Here, we show that UL37C forms an elongated, conformationally flexible species with a folded core and an unstructured C-tail. We hypothesize that, in addition to providing a large surface with many potential binding sites for its multiple binding partners, UL37C can adopt several distinct conformations, each of which mediates a specific subset of UL37 activities. We propose that this conformational flexibility contributes to the multifunctionality of UL37. During expression in Escherichia coli, most of PRV UL37FL is cleaved, which generates the stable N-terminal half but no detectable C-terminal fragment (27.Pitts J.D. Klabis J. Richards A.L. Smith G.A. Heldwein E.E. Crystal structure of the herpesvirus inner tegument protein UL37 supports its essential role in control of viral trafficking.J. Virol. 2014; 88 (24599989): 5462-547310.1128/JVI.00163-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Affinity tagging both the N and C termini of UL37FL allowed for its purification but did not improve the yield. Therefore, the following constructs of PRV UL37C were cloned, expressed, and purified instead: UL37C(478–919)-StII, UL37C(478–884), UL37C(499–884), and UL37C(618–919)-StII (Fig. 1B). Although the last resolved residue of the crystal structure of PRV UL37N is Leu-479, only Trp-477 was unambiguously assigned to UL37N due to extensive interactions within the core. Therefore, conservatively, UL37C starts at residue 478, and UL37C(478–919)-StII represents the largest UL37C construct. UL37C(478–884) lacks a large portion of the unstructured C-terminal tail, whereas UL37C(499–884) additionally lacks the unstructured N-terminal region (Fig. S1). Finally, UL37C(618–919)-StII was designed based on a stable UL37 degradation product observed during expression of HSV-1 UL37 in mammalian cells. 4P. Feng, unpublished observations. Upon size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), all PRV UL37C constructs migrated as apparent dimers or trimers (Fig. 2A). However, SEC-coupled multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) estimated molecular masses of PRV UL37C(478–919)-StII and UL37C(478–884) to be 50 and 46 kDa, which is close to their respective theoretical molecular masses of 48 and 43 kDa. Thus, PRV UL37C is a monomer in solution (Fig. 2, B and C). To rule out concentration-dependent oligomerization, SEC-MALS of UL37C(478–884) was performed at a range of concentrations: 1, 3, and 5 mg/ml. At all three concentrations, UL37C(478–884) was a monomer with an estimated molecular mass of 46 kDa (data not shown). To confirm the lack of dimerization, the PRV UL37C constructs were incubated with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), a homobifunctional cross-linking reagent that reacts with primary amines, including the N-terminal amine and lysine side chains. Monomeric PRV UL37N (27.Pitts J.D. Klabis J. Richards A.L. Smith G.A. Heldwein E.E. Crystal structure of the herpesvirus inner tegument protein UL37 supports its essential role in control of viral trafficking.J. Virol. 2014; 88 (24599989): 5462-547310.1128/JVI.00163-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used as a negative control. No high-molecular-mass species were observed for any construct in the presence of the cross-linker, consistent with a lack of oligomerization (Fig. 2D). The largest UL37C construct, UL37C(478–919)-StII, migrated at ∼55 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2D), higher than its theoretical molecular mass of 48 kDa, yet migrated at ∼48 kDa after incubation with BS3. By contrast, UL37C(478–884) migrated at ∼43 kDa with or without cross-linker (Fig. 2D). The increased mobility of UL37C(478–919)-StII is indicative of intramolecular cross-linking, which prevents complete unfolding under SDS-PAGE conditions. An apparent lack of intramolecular cross-linking in UL37C(478–884), which lacks the second half of the unstructured C-terminal tail, suggests that BS3 reacts with a lysine side chain near the C terminus. UL37C has high α-helical content, according to its CD spectra (Fig. 2E), but is predicted to have an unstructured C-terminal tail (Fig. S1). We used limited proteolysis to map the boundaries of the folded core of UL37C. Digests of UL37C(478–919)-StII with either chymotrypsin or trypsin resulted in a single major proteolytic product migrating at ∼40 kDa, with the trypsin-generated product being slightly larger (Fig. 3, A and B). N-terminal sequencing of both 40-kDa proteolytic products showed that both start with the GPGS sequence, generated by cleavage of the N-terminal His6-SUMO tag by PreScission protease during protein purification (Fig. 1B), implying that trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavage leave the N terminus intact. Neither degradation product retained the C-terminal StII tag, as determined by streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, both proteases cleave UL37C near the C terminus. Mass spectrometry analysis of the chymotrypsin digest showed a predominant peak at 41.8 kDa, consistent with cleavage after residue Leu-866 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S2) (theoretical mass of 41.6 kDa). Trypsin generated a product ∼2 kDa larger, which is consistent with cleavage after residue Arg-884 (theoretical mass 43.5 kDa) (Fig. 3C). According to the secondary structure prediction, both proteolytic sites are located within the unstructured C-terminal tail (Fig. 3C). To assess the overall stability of UL37C, we used the Thermofluor, or differential scanning fluorimetry, assay (29.Phillips, K., and de la Pena, A. H. (2011) The combined use of the Thermofluor assay and ThermoQ analytical software for the determination of protein stability and buffer optimization as an aid in protein crystallization Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol, Chapter 10, Unit 10.28 10.1002/0471142727.mb1028s94 21472694Google Scholar), which estimates the melting temperature (Tm) by measuring binding of a hydrophobic dye to hydrophobic regions exposed during unfolding. Thermal melting was done in 24 different buffer and salt conditions to identify those that could potentially stabilize the protein. The highest Tm for UL37C(478–919)-StII and UL37C(478–884) was 49 and 45 °C, respectively (Fig. 1C, Fig. S3, and Table S1). By contrast, the highest Tm for PRV UL37N is 61 °C (Fig. 1C, Fig. S3, and Table S1). The highest Tm for any construct fell within a pH range of 7.0–7.5 and increased with the addition of 150 mm NaCl and 5–10% glycerol (Table S1). Regardless of buffer conditions, the lowest Tm for PRV UL37N was still higher than any Tm for PRV UL37C. The relatively low melting temperature of UL37C could be due to a weak hydrophobic core (30.Franzosa E.A. Lynagh K.J. Xia Y. Structural correlates of protein melting temperature.in: Experimental Standard Conditions of Enzyme Characterizations. Beilstein-Institut, Ruedesheim/Rhein, Germany2009: 99-106Google Scholar). We have been unable to crystallize any PRV UL37C constructs despite extensive efforts. To obtain structural information on UL37C, we employed small-angle X-ray scattering coupled with SEC (SEC-SAXS), which is used to characterize conformational state and flexibility of macromolecules in solution. SAXS profiles were obtained for three constructs of PRV UL37C and for HSV-1 UL37N, a compact, conformationally rigid protein that served as a control (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5A). PRV UL37C(478–919)-StII and HSV-1 UL37N had only one intensity peak, whereas UL37C(478–884) and UL37C(618–919)-StII each had two peaks. The later peaks correspond to a smaller radius of gyration (Rg) around 5–10 Å, potentially due to degradation products (Fig. 4, B and C). The Rg profile across the primary peak for all samples slopes downward, but frames chosen for analyses had Rg values within ±1 Å of each other. Parameters calculated from SAXS data are summarized in Table 1.Figure 5SAXS analysis of PRV UL37C and HSV-1 UL37N.

NrdB from the firmicute Facklamia ignava is a unique fusion protein with N-terminal add-ons of a glutaredoxin (Grx) domain followed by an ATP-binding domain, the ATP cone. Grx, usually encoded separately from the RNR operon, is a known RNR reductant. We show that the fused Grx domain functions as an efficient reductant of the F. ignava class I RNR via the common dithiol mechanism and, interestingly, also via a monothiol mechanism, although less efficiently. To our knowledge, a Grx that uses both of these two reaction mechanisms has not previously been observed with a native substrate. The ATP cone is in most RNRs an N-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit. It is an allosteric on/off switch promoting ribonucleotide reduction in the presence of ATP and inhibiting RNR activity in the presence of dATP. We found that dATP bound to the ATP cone of F. ignava NrdB promotes formation of tetramers that cannot form active complexes with NrdA. The ATP cone bound two dATP molecules but only one ATP molecule. F. ignava NrdB contains the recently identified radical-generating cofactor MnIII/MnIV. We show that NrdA from F. ignava can form a catalytically competent RNR with the MnIII/MnIV-containing NrdB from the flavobacterium Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis.

https://openalex.org/W2889246843,"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are protein regions that lack persistent secondary or tertiary structure under native conditions. IDRs represent >40% of the eukaryotic proteome and play a crucial role in protein–protein interactions. The classical approach for identification of these interaction interfaces is based on mutagenesis combined with biochemical techniques such as coimmunoprecipitation or yeast two-hybrid screening. This approach either provides information of low resolution (large deletions) or very laboriously tries to precisely define the binding epitope via single amino acid substitutions. Here, we report the use of a peptide microarray based on the human scaffold protein AXIN1 for high-throughput and -resolution mapping of binding sites for several AXIN1 interaction partners in vitro. For each of the AXIN1-binding partners tested, i.e. casein kinase 1 ϵ (CK1ϵ); c-Myc; peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1); and p53, we found at least three different epitopes, predominantly in the central IDR of AXIN1. We functionally validated the specific AXIN1–CK1ϵ interaction identified here with epitope-mimicking peptides and with AXIN1 variants having deletions of short binding epitopes. On the basis of these results, we propose a model in which AXIN1 competes with dishevelled (DVL) for CK1ϵ and regulates CK1ϵ-induced phosphorylation of DVL and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2889281064,"Low serum cholinesterase (SCHE) activity has been associated with poor prognoses in a variety of conditions, including sepsis. However, such an association has not been well characterized since the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force modified the definition of sepsis to ""life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection"" (known as sepsis-3) in 2016. In the current retrospective cohort study, we examined whether 30-day mortality in sepsis-3 patients is associated with SCHE activity. A total of 166 sepsis-3 patients receiving treatment at an emergency intensive care unit (EICU) were included. The 30-day death rate was 33.1% (55/166). SCHE activity upon EICU admission was lower in nonsurvivors (3.3 vs. 4.5 KU/L in survivors, p = 0.0002). Subjects with low SCHE activity (defined as <4 KU/L) had higher 30-day mortality rates than subjects with normal SCHE activity (45.5%, 40/88 vs. 19.2%, 15/78; p<0.001). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an association between 30-day mortality and lower SCHE activity after adjustments for relevant factors, such as acute multiple organ dysfunction. The odds ratio (OR) for every unit decrease in SCHE activity was 2.11 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.37-3.27; p = 0.0008). The area under the curve (AUC) of SCHE activity for predicting 30-day mortality was 0.67 (95% CI 0.59-0.74), and the AUC of lactate for predicting 30-day mortality was 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.70). Using a combination of SCHE and lactate, the AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.83). These data suggest that lower SCHE activity is an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in sepsis-3 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2889372731,"Signaling through the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is mediated by the Patched (Ptch) family of proteins. Although the vertebrate Ptch proteins Ptch1 and Ptch2 harbor two closely related transmembrane modules related to sterol-sensing domains (SSDs), the role of these closely related receptors in the Hh pathway are not equivalent. Ptch1 is essential for development and appears to be the principal receptor mediating responses to Hh ligands, whereas Ptch2 is nonessential, and its role in Hh-signaling remains ambiguous. We hypothesized that the SSDs of the Ptch proteins function as generic modules whose protein-specific activities are determined by the adjacent cytoplasmic and luminal domains. We first showed that individual N-terminal and C-terminal halves of Ptch1 associated noncovalently to mediate ligand-dependent regulation of Hh signaling. The analogous regions of Ptch2 also interacted noncovalently but did not repress the Hh pathway. However, the SSD of Ptch2 were capable of repressing Hh signaling, as determined using chimeric proteins where the SSDs of Ptch1 were replaced by those from Ptch2. Replacement of the SSDs of Ptch1 with the analogous regions from the cholesterol transporter NPC1 failed to produce a chimeric protein capable of Hh repression. Further refinement of the specific regions in Ptch1 and Ptch2 revealed that specific cytoplasmic domains of Ptch1 were necessary but not sufficient for repression of Hh signaling and that the two principal luminal domains of Ptch1 and Ptch2 were interchangeable.

Despite its apparent sequence similarity to Ptch1 in regions critical for Ptch1 activity, conflicting data exist regarding the activities of Ptch2, in particular its ability to repress canonical Hh signaling and its response to Hh ligand. One group has shown that Ptch2 appears to behave similarly to Ptch1 by robustly repressing Smo-dependent Hh signaling and responding to Hh ligand (17Zhulyn O. Li D. Deimling S. Vakili N.A. Mo R. Puviindran V. Chen M.-H. Chuang P.-T. Hopyan S. Hui C.-C. A switch from low to high Shh activity regulates establishment of limb progenitors and signaling centers.Dev. Cell. 2014; 10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Other groups, however, reported only weak repression of Hh signaling (18Holtz A.M. Peterson K.A. Nishi Y. Morin S. Song J.Y. Charron F. McMahon A.P. Allen B.L. Essential role for ligand-dependent feedback antagonism of vertebrate hedgehog signaling by PTCH1, PTCH2 and HHIP1 during neural patterning.Development. 2013; 140 (23900540): 3423-343410.1242/dev.095083Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or no repression at all (19Rahnama F. Toftgård R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Distinct roles of PTCH2 splice variants in Hedgehog signalling.Biochem. J. 2004; 378 (14613484): 325-33410.1042/bj20031200Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) for Ptch2. These apparently contradictory activities for Ptch2 lead to distinct models regarding its role in the Hh pathway. As suggested originally, Ptch2 activity may be redundant to Ptch1 in control of Hh signaling (17Zhulyn O. Li D. Deimling S. Vakili N.A. Mo R. Puviindran V. Chen M.-H. Chuang P.-T. Hopyan S. Hui C.-C.

Cell. 2014; 10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These redundant activities were supported by the observation that Ptch2-deficient mice develop normally, even in tissues with normally high levels of Ptch2 expression (20Lee Y. Miller H.L. Russell H.R. Boyd K. Curran T. McKinnon P.J. Patched2 modulates tumorigenesis in patched1 heterozygous mice.Cancer Res. 2006; 66 (16849540): 6964-697110.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0505Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), or exhibit only minor, nonlethal defects in hair follicles occurring late in adult animals (21Nieuwenhuis E. Motoyama J. Barnfield P.C. Yoshikawa Y. Zhang X. Mo R. Crackower M.A. Hui C. Mice with a targeted mutation of Patched2 are viable but develop alopecia and epidermal hyperplasia.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26 (16914743): 6609-662210.1128/MCB.00295-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, this redundancy does not appear to be reciprocal because mice lacking Ptch1 exhibit an embryonic lethal phenotype (22Goodrich L.V. Milenković L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Altered neural cell fates and medulloblastoma in mouse patched mutants.Science. 1997; 277 (9262482): 1109-111310.1126/science.277.5329.1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). These latter data imply that Ptch1 is the principal regulator of Hh signaling and that Ptch2 cannot compensate for the loss of Ptch1 activity. Indeed, only in the absence of Ptch1 were apparent roles for Ptch2 during development discernable (23Zhulyn O. Nieuwenhuis E. Liu Y.C. Angers S. Hui C. Ptch2 shares overlapping functions with Ptch1 in Smo regulation and limb development.Dev. Biol. 2015; 397 (25448692): 191-20210.1016/j.ydbio.2014.10.023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The apparent lack of Hh pathway repression activity by Ptch2 and its inability to compensate for the lack of Ptch1 suggest an alternative role for Ptch2. In this context, Ptch2 may act primarily as a ligand-dependent antagonist by sequestering Hh ligand (18Holtz A.M. Peterson K.A. Nishi Y. Morin S. Song J.Y. Charron F. McMahon A.P. Allen B.L. Essential role for ligand-dependent feedback antagonism of vertebrate hedgehog signaling by PTCH1, PTCH2 and HHIP1 during neural patterning.Development. 2013; 140 (23900540): 3423-343410.1242/dev.095083Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Alfaro A.C.

In this case, Ptch2 potentially limits the range of Hh ligand activity rather than acting as a direct repressor of Smo-dependent Hh signaling. Taken together, despite the apparent structural similarities to Ptch1, the precise role of Ptch2 in the Hh signaling pathway remains ambiguous. The cartoon in Fig. 1A illustrates the three basic modules in Ptch1 that include two luminal “loops,” the second of which (loop 2) encodes a conserved Hh ligand–binding motif (25Bosanac I. Maun H.R.

These domains are also related to the large class of RND-containing transmembrane transporters in bacteria (for a review, see Ref. 29Nies D.H. Efflux-mediated heavy metal resistance in prokaryotes.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27 (12829273): 313-33910.1016/S0168-6445(03)00048-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Recently, the structures of the luminal and transmembrane domains for human and mouse Ptch1, alone or in complex with Shh-ligand, were solved using cryo-EM (30Gong X. Qian H. Cao P. Zhao X. Zhou Q.

Structural basis for cholesterol transport-like activity of the Hedgehog receptor Patched.bioRxiv. 2018; 10.1101/352443Google Scholar). These structures revealed that the two luminal domains and the two SSD-like regions, respectively, form distinct but closely apposed modules. These structures also provide insights into the possible means by which specific mutations found in Ptch1 in Gorlin syndrome might alter the activities of Ptch1 because at least some of the alterations arise in amino acids at the center of the interface between the two SSD-like modules. These recent Ptch1 structures also revealed a high degree of similarity to the cholesterol transporter Niemann–Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) (33Gong X. Qian H. Zhou X. Wu J. Wan T. Cao P. Huang W. Zhao X. Wang X. Wang P. Shi Y. Gao G.F. Zhou Q. Yan N. Structural insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-mediated cholesterol transfer and Ebola infection.Cell. 2016; 165 (27238017): 1467-147810.1016/j.cell.2016.05.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As suggested by their highly similar sequences, the three-dimensional structure of the two transmembrane modules is predicted to be structurally similar to the analogous regions in NPC1, forming two closely apposed transmembrane domains. Likewise, the luminal regions give rise to a predicted structure similar to the luminal loops in NPC1. Despite these predicted similarities and the recent evidence that loss of NPC1 may alter cilium-dependent Hh signaling activities (34Canterini S. Dragotto J. Dardis A. Zampieri S. De Stefano M.E. Mangia F. Erickson R.P. Fiorenza M.T. Shortened primary cilium length and dysregulated Sonic hedgehog signaling in Niemann-Pick C1 disease.Hum. Mol.

These data suggest that the transmembrane modules of Ptch1 and NPC1 may harbor distinct transport activities either because of intrinsic differences in these modules or to protein-specific activities imparted by their respective adjacent domains. We addressed whether the transmembrane domains, referred to here as SSD1 and SSD2, of Ptch1, Ptch2, and NPC1 behave as generic transmembrane modules whose protein-specific activities are determined by the adjacent luminal and cytoplasmic domains. We showed that, despite Ptch1 and Ptch2 exhibiting distinct Smo-repressing activities, their SSD modules harbored indistinguishable activities. The Hh signaling repression activities were, however, specified in the Ptch family proteins, at least in part, by their adjacent cytoplasmic domains. We further showed that the generic activities of the SSD could not be extended to NPC1 because replacement of either of these domains in Ptch1 with the analogous regions of NPC1 generated proteins incapable of regulating the Hh signaling pathway. Homologs of Patched from Drosophila (dPtc) to vertebrates (Ptch) encode proteins harboring two closely related transmembrane modules known as SSDs. Co-expression of the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of dPtc recapitulated a significant amount of the activity of the intact native molecule (37Johnson R.L. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. In vivo functions of the Patched protein: requirement of the C terminus for target gene inactivation but not Hedgehog sequestration.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6 (10983992): 467-47810.1016/S1097-2765(00)00045-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the two halves of dPtc could assemble noncovalently, as determined in co-immunoprecipitation assays. We first tested whether the halves of vertebrate Ptch1 also interacted noncovalently to form a functional molecule. Vectors expressing either the N-terminal portion (Ptch1-N, aa 1–673) or the HA-tagged C-terminal half (Ptch1-CHA, aa 674–1434) of Ptch1 (Fig. 1B) were expressed in HEK293 cells. Following confirmation of their expression (Fig. 1C, i and ii), immunoprecipitation of either Ptch1-N (Fig. 1C, iii) or Ptch1-CHA (Fig. 1C, iv) co-immunoprecipitated the reciprocal half of Ptch1. Fig. 2 further illustrates that expression of the individual halves of Ptch1 had no effect on canonical Hh signaling in Ptch1-deficient MEFs. However, analogous to the reconstitution of dPtc in Drosophila, co-expression of both halves of mPtch1 potently repressed Smo-dependent Hh signaling. Furthermore, addition of N-Shh ligand reversed this repression to levels similar to those observed for the intact, full-length Ptch1 protein. We showed previously that the cytoplasmic ML and C-terminal regions of Ptch1 mediated oligomerization of Ptch1 (38Fleet A. Lee J.P.Y. Tamachi A. Javeed I. Hamel P.A. Activities of the cytoplasmic domains of Patched-1 modulate but are not essential for regulation of canonical Hedgehog signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 10.1074/jbc.M116.731745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, it was determined next whether these same regions mediated the noncovalent assembly of the two halves of Ptch1. Mutants deleting the cytoplasmic regions of the Ptch1 N- and C-terminal halves, respectively (Fig. 1B), were tested by co-immunoprecipitation for their ability to associate with the reciprocal portion of Ptch1 (Fig. 1C). As lanes 4–6 in Fig. 1C, iii and iv, show, the N- and C-terminal halves of Ptch1 bound to each other regardless of the presence of either cytoplasmic domain. Similar to our previous observations, Fig. 2 shows that Ptch1-CΔML, when expressed with the C-terminal half of Ptch1 (Ptch1-C), repressed Smo-dependent Hh signaling. Deletion of the C terminus (Ptch1-CΔC), however, prevented repression of Hh signaling when expressed in the context of either Ptch1-N or Ptch1-NΔML, consistent with previous observations showing the requirement of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of Ptch1 for repression of Hh signaling (39Kim J. Hsia E.Y. Brigui A. Plessis A. Beachy P.A. Zheng X. The role of ciliary trafficking in Hedgehog receptor signaling.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8 (ra55, 26038600): ra5510.1126/scisignal.aaa5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We also verified that the pairs of Ptch1 fragments were properly transported by determining whether they had been processed through the Golgi. Fig. 3, A and B, shows that P1-N, P1-NΔML, and P1-C do not appear to be processed when expressed individually because cleavage by Endo H was not protected. However, processing of P1-NΔML and, to a lesser extent, P1-N (Fig. 3B) was evident when they were co-expressed with P1-C. Likewise, processing of P1-C and P1-CΔCT was clearly evident when they were co-expressed with P1-NΔML and P1-N, respectively. Only when P1-C was co-expressed with P1-N was no processing evident for the C-terminal portion of Ptch1. The lack of processing was unrelated, however, to the ability of this pair of Ptch1 fragments to repress Hh signaling and respond to Hh ligand. Thus, the two halves of mPtch1 can interact noncovalently independently of their cytoplasmic domains to generate a functional protein that represses Smo activity and responds to Hh ligand. The primary structure of Ptch1 shares high sequence identity with the closely related protein Ptch2 (14Motoyama J. Takabatake T. Takeshima K. Hui C. Ptch2, a second mouse Patched gene is co-expressed with Sonic hedgehog.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18 (9462734): 104-10610.1038/ng0298-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Smyth I.

This similarity is evident for the luminal and the transmembrane domains. However, the primary sequence of the cytoplasmic regions of Ptch1 and Ptch2 are structurally unrelated. We determined next whether the reciprocal halves of Ptch1 and Ptch2 (see Fig. 4A) could associate noncovalently and whether they gave rise to a functional regulator of canonical Hh signaling. After verification of expression of the various halves of Ptch1 and Ptch2 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4B), the ability of these proteins to associate noncovalently was tested in co-immunoprecipitation assays. The N- and C-terminal halves of Ptch2 co-immunoprecipitated with the reciprocal C- and N-terminal portions, respectively, of Ptch1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 2, 4, and 6). However, despite their ability to form complexes, repression of Hh signaling was not apparent (Fig. 4D). The lack of activity of the heterologous complexes was consistent, however, with the failure of intact, full-length Ptch2 to repress Hh signaling in this assay. To ensure that the lack of Hh signaling repression activity of Ptch2 was not due to the presence of saturating levels of Ptch2 in the Ptch1-deficient MEFs, we deleted Ptch2 in this Ptch1-deficient line and performed a titration assay for Ptch2 activity. Fig. 5 shows that Hh signaling, although exquisitely sensitive to Ptch1 expression, is refractory to the expression of Ptch2. Only when Ptch2 was expressed at unusually high levels was a small but significant level of repression of Hh signaling observed.Figure 5Ptch2 does not repress Smo-dependent Hh signaling. Ptch2-deficient cells were derived from Ptch1-deficient MEFs. The ability of Ptch1 or Ptch2 to repress Hh signaling in a transient assay was assessed by titrating increasing levels of constructs expressing these two proteins. Although exquisitely sensitive to repression by Ptch1, these cells showed essentially no repression of Hh signaling when FLAGPtch2 was expressed. ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the high degree of similarity between the sequences of Ptch1 and Ptch2 in their luminal and transmembrane domains, the failure of Ptch2 to repress Hh signaling appears paradoxical. Thus, we tested the Hh signaling activities of the transmembrane domains of Ptch2 in the context of the luminal and cytoplasmic regions of Ptch1. Specifically, the transmembrane modules of Ptch1 were replaced, either individually or together, with the analogous regions from Ptch2 (Fig. 6A). Potent repression of Hh signaling was observed for chimeric Ptch1 proteins harboring either individual or both transmembrane regions from Ptch2 (Fig. 6B). Thus, both transmembrane domains of Ptch2 are competent to repress Hh signaling in the context of the adjacent luminal and cytoplasmic domains of Ptch1. This activity for the SSDs of Ptch2 is observed despite their apparent inability to repress Hh signaling in the context of the adjacent domains of Ptch2. Because the SSD of Ptch2 could replace the activities of these regions of Ptch1, we next determined whether the SSDs of more distally related SSD-containing proteins acted as generic modules whose protein-specific activities were determined by the adjacent luminal and cytoplasmic domains. Thus, we replaced the SSD modules of Ptch1 with those from the cholesterol transporter NPC1 (Fig. 7A) and tested the chimeric proteins for their ability to repress Hh signaling. As Fig. 7B demonstrates, neither of the SSD regions of NPC1 mediated repression of Hh signaling, even when all but a single SSD of the chimeric protein were attributable to Ptch1. We next asked whether the NPC1 and Ptch1 SSDs were fundamentally distinct or whether the NPC1 SSDs could be made functional by altering two specific amino acid residues in the third transmembrane helix of SSD1. These residues are required for Ptch1 function and, as Fig. 9 illustrates, are different in NPC1 (3Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Maiti T. Beachy P.A.

Invading UPEC cells may encounter one of several fates, including degradation in the lysosome, expulsion to the extracellular milieu for clearance, or survival as an intracellular bacterial community and quiescent intracellular reservoir that can cause later infections. Here we considered the possibility that UPEC cells secrete factors that activate specific host cell signaling networks to facilitate the UPEC invasion of BECs. Using GFP-based reporters and Western blot analysis, we found that the representative human cystitis isolate E. coli UTI89 and its derivative UTI89ΔFimH, which does not bind to BECs, equally activate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-OH kinase (PI3K), Akt kinase, and mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 in BECs. We also found that conditioned medium taken from UTI89 and UTI89ΔFimH cultures similarly activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), PI3K, Akt, and mTORC and that inhibition of EGFR and mTORC2, but not mTORC1, abrogates UTI89 invasion in vitro and in animal models of UTI. Our results reveal a key molecular mechanism of UPEC invasion and the host cells it targets, insights that may have therapeutic utility for managing the ever-increasing number of persistent and chronic UTIs.

The persistent and chronic UTIs are difficult to treat, in part because of the quiescent nature of the intracellular UPEC that can be “reawakened” to initiate a second wave of infection of host epithelial cells (6.Gilbert N.M. O'Brien V.P. Lewis A.L. Transient microbiota exposures activate dormant Escherichia coli infection in the bladder and drive severe outcomes of recurrent disease.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 (28358889): e100623810.1371/journal.ppat.1006238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). urinary tract infection uropathogenic Escherichia coli bladder epithelial cell phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-OH kinase inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pleckstrin homology Luria Bertani conditioned medium/media short hairpin RNA lipopolysaccharide Toll-like receptor epidermal growth factor receptor focal adhesion kinase G protein–coupled receptor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase analysis of variance. UPEC encode virulence factors, including secreted mediators and adhesive organelles (e.g. adhesins), that interact with the host cell to promote infection. Type I fimbriae (or pili) are the most common adhesins, being expressed in the majority of UPEC (7.Hagberg L. Jodal U. Korhonen T.K. Lidin-Janson G. Lindberg U. Svanborg Edén C.

The ability of UPEC to adhere to host bladder epithelial cells (BECs) is considered the most critical factor in uropathogenicity (9.Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J.

Adhered UPEC have the capacity to invade, or enter, the epithelial cells and replicate in the intracellular space. Cell-based imaging studies have revealed that internalized UPEC may be found free in the cytosol or within membrane-enclosed vesicles. Free cytosolic UPEC rapidly multiply and form biofilm-like assemblies called intracellular bacterial communities (10.Anderson G.G. Dodson K.W. Hooton T.M. Hultgren S.J.

Here, UPEC enter a dormant state, and the quiescent nature of the internalized UPEC renders them protected from natural bacterial flushing through the bulk flow of urine, immune cell surveillance, and extracellularly acting antibiotics.

UPEC can invade bladder cells through the endocytic machineries of phagocytosis and pinocytosis (9.Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J.

Caveolae are highly ordered plasma membrane invaginations enriched in scaffolding and signal transduction proteins. Clathrin-coated pits are comprised primarily of clathrin and assembly proteins that create latticed pit invaginations on the plasma membrane and can serve as cargo portals that transport, among others, pathogens (e.g. viruses and bacteria) from the extracellular milieu to inside host cells (19.Pho M.T.

Nonetheless, the regulatory machineries and exact host cell mediators involved in the UPEC-induced vesicle formation and trafficking from the plasma membrane remain incomplete.

Activated mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on Ser-473, and PDK1 phosphorylates it on Thr-308, rendering Akt fully activated to phosphorylate mTORC1 (Fig. 1A). We examined effect of UPEC on PI3K activation using the biosensor GFP–Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk)–PH, which binds PIP3 (26.Chang J.D. Field S.J. Rameh L.E. Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C.

Exposure of bladder epithelial 5637 cells to the human cystitis isolate UTI89 induced recruitment of GFP-Btk-PH to the plasma membrane, confirming PI3K activation (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the adhesin FimH, which is expressed on the tip of type I pili (to generate UTI89ΔFimH) renders the bacteria deficient in direct binding to BECs (Fig. S1A), consistent with published reports (9.Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. Type 1 pilus-mediated bacterial invasion of bladder epithelial cells.EMBO J. 2000; 19 (10856226): 2803-281210.1093/emboj/19.12.2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 17.Wang Z. Humphrey C.

Notably, UTI89ΔFimH promoted the recruitment of GFP-Btk-PH to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B), implying that FimH-mediated physical association of the bacteria with host cells is not a prerequisite for PI3K activation in host BECs. Incubation of UTI89 and UTI89ΔFimH with BECs induced time-dependent phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) on both Ser-473 and Thr-308 (Fig. 1C). Treatment with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (Fig. 1D) and LY294002 (Fig. S1B) dose-dependently decreased UTI89- and UTI89ΔFimH-induced p-Akt. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin (Fig. 1E) and LY294002 (Fig. S1C) inhibited UPEC invasion by more than 80% at the highest concentrations used. We also used Bay 80-6946 and MK-2206, small-molecule inhibitors of PI3K and Akt, respectively, that are in clinical trials for cancer (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01411410). Western blotting results validated the drugs' activities; each inhibited UTI89- and UTI89ΔFimH-mediated p-Akt (Fig. 1F) and UTI89 invasion by up to 70% (Fig. 1G), further supporting the conclusion that the activated PI3K–Akt axis is required for UPEC invasion. UTI89ΔFimH bacteria are deficient in binding to BECs (Fig. S1A) and, like UTI89, are fully capable of activating PI3K and Akt (Fig. 1), suggesting possible involvement of bacterial secreted factor(s). To test this idea, UTI89 bacteria were allowed to grow in Luria Bertani (LB) broth, and conditioned medium (CM) was isolated by stepwise centrifugation at 6,000, 12,000, and 300,000 rpm, followed by filtration through 0.22-μm pores that do not allow the passage of intact bacteria (Fig. S2A). BECs were incubated with equal volumes of LB alone (negative control) or the isolated UTI89 CM, and whole-cell lysates were obtained and subjected to Western blotting. The results evidenced a UTI89 CM–induced increase in p-Akt and p-mTOR signals compared with LB alone (Fig. S2B). Moreover, the Western blotting results showed a time-dependent increase of p-Akt by UTI89 (and UTI89ΔFimH) and their respective CM (Fig. S2C), supporting the conclusion that UPEC CM–found factor(s) act upon host BECs to activate specific signaling networks involved in bacterial invasion. Activated Akt phosphorylates and activates mTORC1 (24.Saxton R.A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth, metabolism, and disease.Cell. 2017; 168 (28283069): 960-97610.1016/j.cell.2017.02.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). We used complementary pharmacologic and biologic reagents to parse the potential selective roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in UTI89 invasion of BECs. AZD8055 inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2, whereas rapamycin (at low concentrations) selectively inhibits mTORC1. Treatment of BECs with AZD8055, but not rapamycin, inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in response to treatment with CM from UTI89 and UTI89ΔFimH (Fig. 2A). Also, treatment with rapamycin inhibited phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70S6K (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, AZD8055 significantly inhibited UTI89 invasion (>75%) compared with nontreated samples, whereas rapamycin did not significantly increase invasion (Fig. 2B), suggesting that mTORC2 facilitates the bacterial invasion of BECs. The results may also imply that inactivation of mTORC1 promotes bacterial invasion by increasing PI3K flux to mTORC2 and Akt. Neither AZD8055 nor rapamycin affected UTI89 attachment to BECs, as measured by counting GFP-UTI89 associated with BECs (Fig. S3). The mTOR protein is a unit of the multiprotein complexes of mTORC1 and mTORC2, and we knocked down expression of mTOR using shRNA targeting sequences (Fig. 2C). Depletion of mTOR expression using two shRNAs reduced UPEC invasion of BECs by 75% (Fig. 2D). Notably, knockdown of mTOR protein expression effectively inhibited UTI89 CM–induced phosphorylation of p70S6K (Fig. 2E). To add support to the conclusion that mTORC2, but not mTORC1, promotes UPEC invasion (Fig. 2B), we knocked down expression of the mTORC1- and mTORC2-specific components Raptor (Fig. 2F) and Rictor (Fig. 2G), respectively. Knockdown of Raptor decreased UTI89 CM–mediated phosphorylation of p70S6K, but not appreciably Akt (Fig. 2F), and increased bacterial invasion by 2-fold (Fig. 2H). On the other hand, knockdown of Rictor inhibited UTI89 CM–induced p70S6K and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2G) and, consistent with the pharmacologic reagents results (Fig. 2B), decreased bacterial invasion by about 50% (Fig. 2H). Neither knockdown of Raptor nor Rictor had any effect on UTI89 attachment to BECs (Fig. 2I). Collectively, these results demonstrate a requirement for mTORC2, but not mTORC1, in UTI89 entry but not attachment to BECs. Our results suggest that PI3K, Akt, and mTORC2 facilitate bacterial invasion, but how these intracellular enzymes become activated in response to extracellularly found UPEC (UTI89ΔFimH) and bacterial CM remains unclear. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the most studied UPEC virulence factor and has been implicated in a variety of host cell responses (27.Pasare C. Medzhitov R. Toll-like receptors: linking innate and adaptive immunity.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2005; 560 (15932016): 11-1810.1007/0-387-24180-9_2Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To test for a potential role in UPEC invasion, we quantified the effect of purified LPS on Akt phosphorylation and could show a (high) dose-dependent increase in p-Akt (Fig. S4A). LPS is shed from bacteria and impacts target cells by binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Our results show that treatment of BECs with the TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095 obliterated LPS-induced p-Akt (Fig. S4B). However, treatment with CLI-095 (Fig. S4C), like knockdown of TLR4 expression with siRNA (Fig. S4D), failed to reduce UTI89 invasion. Admittedly, LPS may impact host cells by binding other TLRs. Nonetheless, our results imply that UPEC invade BECs in a TLR4-independent manner. In agreement, TLR4 was recently reported to rather promote the expulsion of intracellular UPEC from invaded BECs (28.Miao Y. Bist P. Wu J. Zhao Q. Li Q.J. Wan Y. Abraham S.N. Collaboration between distinct Rab small GTPase trafficking circuits mediates bacterial clearance from the bladder epithelium.Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 22 (28910634): 330-342.e410.1016/j.chom.2017.08.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29.Miao Y.

Available evidence shows that growth factors, acting upon cognate plasma membrane–anchored receptors, activate PI3K and mTORC2 in a variety of cell types (24.Saxton R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2889095763,"A single-injection vaccine formulation that provides for both a prime and a boost immunization would have various advantages over a multiple-injection regime. For such a vaccine formulation, it is essential that the booster dose is released after a certain, preferably adjustable, lag time. In this study we investigated whether a core-shell based implant, containing ovalbumin as core material and poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) of various monomer ratios as shell material can be used to obtain such a booster release. An in vitro release study showed that the lag time after which the ovalbumin was released from the core-shell implant increased with increasing lactic to glycolic acid ratio of the polymer and ranged from 3–6 weeks. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed minimal differences between native ovalbumin and ovalbumin from core-shell implants that were incubated until just before the observed in vitro release. In addition, mice immunized with a subcutaneous inserted core-shell implant containing ovalbumin showed an ovalbumin-specific IgG1 antibody response after a lag time of 4 or 6–8 weeks. Moreover, delayed release of ovalbumin caused higher IgG1 antibody titers than conventional subcutaneous vaccination with ovalbumin dissolved in PBS. Collectively, these findings could contribute to the further development of a single-injection vaccine, making multiple injections of the vaccine superfluous."

https://openalex.org/W2888971643,"Background Due to a lack of relevant data on induced abortions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as well as the persistence of maternal deaths in the country, this study aims to analyze the extent and characteristics of induced abortion-related complications in women who were admitted to referral health facilities in Kinshasa, including the duration of hospitalization, the mortality rate due to induced abortion complications and their characteristics, and the deaths that occurred after two days of hospitalization. Methods This is a cross-sectional study on 843 obstetric and gynecological patients who were admitted as emergency cases to five referral health facilities in Kinshasa during 2014. These facilities were selected as being representative of five types of districts in Kinshasa, according to their cultural, socioeconomic, and infrastructural characteristics. Patient data were collected from patient records and analyzed. Results From the 843 patients admitted to receive obstetric and gynecological emergency care services in 2014 at the health facilities surveyed, 14.7% (95% CI: 12.4–17.3%) had complications due to induced abortion. These complications were significantly diagnosed in adolescents (p = 0.003) and in single, separated, divorced, or widowed women (p = 0.03). The median duration of hospitalization was nine days, and this period of time was significantly longer for the patients who underwent surgery for pelvic peritonitis due to uterine perforation compared with the patients who underwent Caesarean section/hysterectomy. Furthermore, it was significantly longer for the patients who were treated for other induced-abortion related complications compared with patients treated for spontaneous abortion. The mortality rate related to induced abortions was 5.6% (95% CI: 2.3–11.3%), with an increase in risk of death in the presence of a postabortive pelvic peritonitis-type complication; 42.9% of deaths occurred after two days of hospitalization. Conclusion The complications of induced abortions are a major public health problem due to their frequency among patients admitted to Kinshasa's referral health facilities, their mortality, and their poor medical management. Therefore, there is a need to understand the reason for its poor medical management in order to provide an adequate intervention program."

Method Fifty-three children were recruited from community health centers. The WCST, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R), and Taiwan Birth Cohort Study- Developmental Instrument (TBCS-DI) was used to measure children's executive function, IQ and parent report of children's development respectively. Results Mean categories achieved (CA) was 2.02 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.41), and percent conceptual level response (PCLR) was 29.85(SD = 18.36) in five year-olds. The WCST indices showed a pathway relationship of PCLR being negatively associated with perseverative error (PE), and PE and non- perseverative error being negatively associated with CA. Association among the PCLR index of the WCST, cognitive domain of the TBCS-DI, and performance IQ and verbal IQ of the WPPSI-R was found. Conclusion Regular improvement with age was found compared to the norm of six-year-olds in a previous study of children from the same region. The number sorting criteria was more difficult thus they continued to perform persistent errors of color or form when sorting. Association was found among the professional administered IQ, computerized WCST, and a parent report developmental instrument.

Every revolution in technology is followed by an explosion of new scientific knowledge. Biology is no exception. Van Leeuwenhoek's microscope jump-started microbiology, polymerase chain reaction revolutionized molecular biology (see Editorial in this issue), and single-cell imaging and sequencing approaches remarkably advanced immunology, cancer research, developmental biology, and beyond.

Recent years have witnessed disruptive innovations in biotechnology. Researchers have never been equipped with more powerful tools to probe biology. Breakthroughs in electron microscopy allow biomolecular complexes to be visualized with high resolution, offering insight into the workings of these molecular machines. Ingenious methods to break the diffraction limit in microscopy enable single molecules to be observed and tracked in single cells. Not only do we see cells in ever-greater detail, but with CRISPR-mediated gene editing techniques, biologists can precisely and easily manipulate cellular genomes of diverse organisms. As we gain understanding of biological networks, tools including those based on CRISPR give us the ability to record biological events, to detect and treat disease, and to engineer plants with new traits and greater productivity.

When biologists encounter problems that cannot be solved by currently available technologies, shared creativity between researchers drives the development of better and smarter tools. New technologies, in turn, push the frontier of biology. This synergy has been moving our society and humanity forward, and the advent of artificial intelligence is likely to speed up this cycle of discovery.

https://openalex.org/W2888777863,"Like many science students, I had always envisioned a pretty straightforward career path: a graduate degree, postdoctoral research, and—if all went well—a faculty position. But I was thrown off this track before I even completed my bachelor's degree in biology. A university strike delayed my graduation, and as a result I missed the graduate school application deadline. Suddenly I had no idea what my future might hold, and I needed to make a living. I was relieved to be offered a job managing a newly established conservation area in my home state of Sergipe in Brazil, and I was excited about working to support biodiversity. But in the back of my mind, I worried that the job would take me in the wrong direction, away from the academic career I still desired.

The idea of managing a protected area was appealing, but my everyday workload was far from inspiring. I handled some interesting challenges, such as reaching a compromise with the ranchers whose cattle needed to cross the reserve for water. But I spent more time on paperwork and meetings than on ecosystems and biodiversity. And the only opportunities for career advancement were administrative positions, one step away from becoming a career bureaucrat. That was not how I wanted to spend my life.

So, 3 years in, I decided that I needed to make a change. I had managed to complete a master's degree in ecology and conservation on the side while working at my day job, and in my spare time, I studied the reserve's frogs. But it was time to get back on the academic ladder full time. Applying to Ph.D. programs was the obvious next step.

When I was accepted into a program in ecology and evolution, I couldn't wait to trade government paperwork for the intellectual stimulation of being fully immersed in research. Yet I was a bit unsure how well my transition back to academia would go. Would the skills I developed during my years at the reserve be of any use in my new endeavor, or would I be hopelessly rusty and lost?

At first, as I had feared, I felt a little behind my fellow students. Despite the supportive environment, I couldn't escape the fact that I lacked skills vital to my new research field, such as programming and advanced statistics. I doubted that I would ever make any progress in my research or produce a decent thesis.

But I soon realized that, during my time at the reserve, I had developed my own valuable skills. Managing the conservation area, which relied on community participation and compromise, had taught me to work collaboratively. Through juggling reserve management, community meetings, and endless paperwork, I had learned to work creatively and, above all, to get things done. I soon realized that doing multivariate analyses was no harder than dealing with the multidimensional problems of reserve management, and that writing scientific papers was no more demanding than compiling environmental policy reports. And my collaborative approach served me well as I worked closely with my new peers. In time, I gained the confidence I needed to succeed.

Three years after starting my Ph.D., I found what I hoped would be my next career step: a permanent faculty position at my alma mater. As I went into overdrive to finish my thesis and put together a compelling application, I drew on abilities honed during my time managing the conservation area—including meeting deadlines and multitasking effectively—to wrap up my degree and land the job.

Looking back, I appreciate how my precocious experience as a reserve administrator has contributed to my progress in academia. I had been thrown into the deep end, alone at a completely new reserve, where I was expected to mediate conflicts and solve problems with next to no resources. In turn, I developed creativity, persuasiveness, and patience. My initial detour from my academic goals ended up being a shortcut to the career I have always wanted.
