https://openalex.org/W2948487481,"The nucleus of mammalian cells displays a distinct spatial segregation of active euchromatic and inactive heterochromatic regions of the genome1,2. In conventional nuclei, microscopy shows that euchromatin is localized in the nuclear interior and heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery1,2. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analyses show this segregation as a plaid pattern of contact enrichment within euchromatin and heterochromatin compartments3, and depletion between them. Many mechanisms for the formation of compartments have been proposed, such as attraction of heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina2,4, preferential attraction of similar chromatin to each other1,4-12, higher levels of chromatin mobility in active chromatin13-15 and transcription-related clustering of euchromatin16,17. However, these hypotheses have remained inconclusive, owing to the difficulty of disentangling intra-chromatin and chromatin-lamina interactions in conventional nuclei18. The marked reorganization of interphase chromosomes in the inverted nuclei of rods in nocturnal mammals19,20 provides an opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie spatial compartmentalization. Here we combine Hi-C analysis of inverted rod nuclei with microscopy and polymer simulations. We find that attractions between heterochromatic regions are crucial for establishing both compartmentalization and the concentric shells of pericentromeric heterochromatin, facultative heterochromatin and euchromatin in the inverted nucleus. When interactions between heterochromatin and the lamina are added, the same model recreates the conventional nuclear organization. In addition, our models allow us to rule out mechanisms of compartmentalization that involve strong euchromatin interactions. Together, our experiments and modelling suggest that attractions between heterochromatic regions are essential for the phase separation of the active and inactive genome in inverted and conventional nuclei, whereas interactions of the chromatin with the lamina are necessary to build the conventional architecture from these segregated phases."

Factors affecting the development and composition of these communities are still poorly understood. Additionally, whether there are plastic-type specific communities developing on different plastics remains enigmatic. We determined the development and succession of bacterial communities on different plastics under ambient and dim light conditions in the coastal Northern Adriatic over the course of two months using scanning electron microscopy and 16S rRNA gene analyses. Plastics used were low- and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE, respectively), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride with two typical additives (PVC DEHP and PVC DINP). The bacterial communities developing on the plastics clustered in two groups; one group was found on PVC and the other group on all the other plastics and on glass, which was used as an inert control. Specific bacterial taxa were found on specific surfaces in essentially all stages of biofilm development and in both ambient and dim light conditions. Differences in bacterial community composition between the different plastics and light exposures were stronger after an incubation period of one week than at the later stages of the incubation. Under both ambient and dim light conditions, one part of the bacterial community was common on all plastic types, especially in later stages of the biofilm development, with families such as Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Planctomycetaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae presenting relatively high relative abundances on all surfaces. Another part of the bacterial community was plastic-type specific. The plastic-type specific fraction was variable among the different plastic types and was more abundant after one week of incubation than at later stages of the succession."
https://openalex.org/W2948315428,"An objective analysis of the human movement can help both clinical assessment and sports performance. Kinovea is a free 2D motion analysis software that can be used to measure kinematic parameters. This low-cost technology has been used in sports sciences, as well as in the clinical and research fields. One interesting tool is that it can measure an object (or person) passing in front of the camera, taking into account the perspective between the camera and the recorded object. Although it has been validated as a tool to assess time-related variables, few studies assessed its validity compared to a Gold Standard; furthermore, its reliability in different perspectives has not been previously assessed. The main objective of this study is to determine the validity of the Kinovea software compared to AutoCAD, and its intra and inter-rater reliability in obtaining coordinates data; a second objective is to compare their results at 4 different perspectives (90°, 75°, 60° and 45°) and to assess the inter and intra rater reliability at each perspective. For this purpose, a wire structure figure in the shape of a human lower limb was designed and measured in AutoCAD; it was then recorded during a pendular motion with a video-camera placed at distance of 5 m and analyzed with Kinovea in the 4 perspectives (90°, 75°, 60° and 45°). Each frame was examined by three observers who made two attempts. A multiple approach was applied involving the analysis of the systematic error, with a two-way ANOVA 2x4; the relative reliability with Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and the Coefficient of Variance (CV) (95% confidence interval); and the absolute reliability with the Standard Error (SE). The results indicate that the Kinovea software is a valid and reliable tool that is able to measure accurately at distances up to 5 m from the object and at an angle range of 90°-45°. Nevertheless, for optimum results an angle of 90° is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2948525172,"The formation of excitons in organic molecules by charge injection is an essential process in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)1-7. According to a simple model based on spin statistics, the injected charges form spin-singlet (S1) excitons and spin-triplet (T1) excitons in a 1:3 ratio2-4. After the first report of a highly efficient OLED2 based on phosphorescence, which is produced by the decay of T1 excitons, more effective use of these excitons has been the primary strategy for increasing the energy efficiency of OLEDs. Another route to improving OLED energy efficiency is reduction of the operating voltage2-6. Because T1 excitons have lower energy than S1 excitons (owing to the exchange interaction), use of the energy difference could-in principle-enable exclusive production of T1 excitons at low OLED operating voltages. However, a way to achieve such selective and direct formation of these excitons has not yet been established. Here we report a single-molecule investigation of electroluminescence using a scanning tunnelling microscope8-20 and demonstrate a simple method of selective formation of T1 excitons that utilizes a charged molecule. A 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylicdianhydride (PTCDA) molecule21-25 adsorbed on a three-monolayer NaCl film atop Ag(111) shows both phosphorescence and fluorescence signals at high applied voltage. In contrast, only phosphorescence occurs at low applied voltage, indicating selective formation of T1 excitons without creating their S1 counterparts. The bias voltage dependence of the phosphorescence, combined with differential conductance measurements, reveals that spin-selective electron removal from a negatively charged PTCDA molecule is the dominant formation mechanism of T1 excitons in this system, which can be explained by considering the exchange interaction in the charged molecule. Our findings show that the electron transport process accompanying exciton formation can be controlled by manipulating an electron spin inside a molecule. We anticipate that designing a device taking into account the exchange interaction could realize an OLED with a lower operating voltage."
https://openalex.org/W2948811056,"Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death by an infectious disease worldwide1. However, the involvement of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in immune responses to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is unknown. Here we show that circulating subsets of ILCs are depleted from the blood of participants with pulmonary tuberculosis and restored upon treatment. Tuberculosis increased accumulation of ILC subsets in the human lung, coinciding with a robust transcriptional response to infection, including a role in orchestrating the recruitment of immune subsets. Using mouse models, we show that group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) accumulated rapidly in Mtb-infected lungs and coincided with the accumulation of alveolar macrophages. Notably, mice that lacked ILC3s exhibited a reduction in the accumulation of early alveolar macrophages and decreased Mtb control. We show that the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5)–C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) axis is involved in Mtb control, as infection upregulates CXCR5 on circulating ILC3s and increases plasma levels of its ligand, CXCL13, in humans. Moreover, interleukin-23-dependent expansion of ILC3s in mice and production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22 were found to be critical inducers of lung CXCL13, early innate immunity and the formation of protective lymphoid follicles within granulomas. Thus, we demonstrate an early protective role for ILC3s in immunity to Mtb infection. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells are recruited to the lung and involved in the immune response to infection with tuberculosis in humans and mice, as a reduction in group 3 innate lymphoid cells in the lung impaired early immune control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2948859220,"The oncoprotein Smoothened (SMO), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) of the Frizzled-class (class-F), transduces the Hedgehog signal from the tumour suppressor Patched-1 (PTCH1) to the glioma-associated-oncogene (GLI) transcription factors, which activates the Hedgehog signalling pathway1,2. It has remained unknown how PTCH1 modulates SMO, how SMO is stimulated to form a complex with heterotrimeric G proteins and whether G-protein coupling contributes to the activation of GLI proteins3. Here we show that 24,25-epoxycholesterol, which we identify as an endogenous ligand of PTCH1, can stimulate Hedgehog signalling in cells and can trigger G-protein signalling via human SMO in vitro. We present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of human SMO bound to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and coupled to a heterotrimeric Gi protein. The structure reveals a ligand-binding site for 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol in the 7-transmembrane region, as well as a Gi-coupled activation mechanism of human SMO. Notably, the Gi protein presents a different arrangement from that of class-A GPCR-Gi complexes. Our work provides molecular insights into Hedgehog signal transduction and the activation of a class-F GPCR."

https://openalex.org/W2948671659,"Online citizen science projects such as GalaxyZoo1, Eyewire2 and Phylo3 have proven very successful for data collection, annotation and processing, but for the most part have harnessed human pattern-recognition skills rather than human creativity. An exception is the game EteRNA4, in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein-folding game Foldit5. Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure and an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top-scoring solutions and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now-starting from an extended polypeptide chain-generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences that encode them in silico. One hundred forty-six Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed and soluble in Escherichia coli, and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds-including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High-resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge that contributes to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges such as the protein design problem."

https://openalex.org/W2948719773,"Background New influenza vaccines eliciting more effective protection are needed, particularly for the elderly who paid a large and disproportional toll of hospitalization and dead during seasonal influenza epidemics. Low (≤15 μg/strain) doses of a new plant-derived virus-like-particle (VLP) vaccine candidate have been shown to induce humoral and cellular responses against both homologous and heterologous strains in healthy adults 18–64 years of age. The two clinical trials reported here addressed the safety and immunogenicity of higher doses (≥15 μg/strain) of quadrivalent VLP candidate vaccine on 18–49 years old and ≥50 years old subjects. We also investigated the impact of alum on the immunogenicity induced by lower doses of the vaccine candidate. Method In the first Phase II trial reported here (NCT02233816), 18–49 year old subjects received 15, 30 or 60 μg/strain of a hemagglutinin-bearing quadrivalent virus-like particle (QVLP) vaccine or placebo. In the second trial (NCT02236052), ≥50 years old subjects received QVLP as above or placebo with additional groups receiving 7.5 or 15 μg/strain with alum. Along with safety recording, the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were analyzed. Results Local and systemic side-effects were similar to those reported previously. The QVLP vaccine induced significant homologous and heterologous antibody responses at the two higher doses, the addition of alum having little-to-no effect. Serologic outcomes tended to be lower in ≥50 years old subjects previously vaccinated. The candidate vaccine also consistently elicited both homologous and heterologous antigen-specific CD4+ T cells characterized by their production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukine-2 (IL-2) and/or tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) upon ex vivo antigenic restimulation. Conclusion Overall, the 30 μg dose produced the most consistent humoral and cellular responses in both 18–49 and ≥50 years old subjects, strongly supporting the clinical development of this candidate vaccine. That particular dose was chosen to test in the ongoing Phase III clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W3104678796,"Some of the most sensitive and precise measurements to date are based on matterwave interferometry with freely falling atomic clouds. Examples include high-precision measurements of inertia, gravity and rotation. In order to achieve these very high sensitivities, the interrogation time has to be very long and consequently the experimental apparatus has to be very tall, in some cases reaching ten or even one hundred meters. Cancelling gravitational acceleration, e.g. in atomtronic circuits6,7 and matterwave guides, will result in compact devices having much extended interrogation times and thus much increased sensitivity both for fundamental and practical measurements. In this letter, we demonstrate extremely smooth and controllable matterwave guides by transporting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) over macroscopic distances: We use a novel neutral-atom accelerator ring to bring BECs to very high speeds (16x their velocity of sound) and transport them in a magnetic matterwave guide for 15 cm whilst fully preserving their internal coherence. The high angular momentum of more than 40000h per atom gives access to the higher Landau levels of quantum Hall states. The hypersonic velocities combined with our ability to control the potentials with pico-Kelvin precision open new perspectives in the study of superfluidity and give rise to new regimes of tunnelling and transport. Coherent matterwave guides are expected to enable interaction times of several seconds in highly compact devices. These developments will result in portable guided-atom interferometers for applications such as inertial navigation and gravity mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2948171581,"Obesity increases the risk of developing insulin resistance and diabetes and is a major public health concern. Our previous study shows that dietary β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) improves lipid metabolism in a pig model. However, it remains unclear whether HMB blocks obesity through gut microbiota. In this study, we found that HMB reduced body weight, alleviated the whitening of brown adipose tissue, and improved insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). High-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA demonstrated that HMB administration significantly reversed the gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice, including the diversity of gut microbiota and relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Moreover, microbiota transplantation from HMB-treated mice attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Furthermore, HFD-fed mice showed lower short-chain fatty acids, whereas administration of HMB increased the propionic acid production. Correlation analysis identified a significant correlation between propionic acid production and the relative Bacteroidetes abundance. Sodium propionate treatment also attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Collectively, our results indicated that HMB might be used as a probiotic agent to reverse HFD-induced obesity, and the potential mechanism was associated with reprogramming gut microbiota and metabolism, especially Bacteroidetes-mediated propionic acid production. In future studies, more efforts should be made to confirm and expand the beneficial effects of HMB to human models.-Duan, Y., Zhong, Y., Xiao, H., Zheng, C., Song, B., Wang, W., Guo, Q., Li, Y., Han, H., Gao, J., Xu, K., Li, T., Yin, Y., Li, F., Yin, J., Kong, X.

https://openalex.org/W2948883828,"In bone remodeling, after a lifespan of ∼2 weeks, osteoclasts undergo apoptosis in each bone turnover cycle, resulting in generation of a large number of apoptotic bodies (ABs). However, the biological roles of osteoclast-derived ABs (OC-ABs) in bone remodeling have not been investigated and remain unknown. In this study, we stimulated bone marrow macrophages with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) to obtain both preosteoclasts and mature osteoclasts (mOCs). We then used alendronate to induce apoptosis in preosteoclasts and mOCs and generate the respective ABs and used flow cytometry and immunoblotting to characterize the sizes and immunogenic characteristics of the extracted ABs. We show that mOC-ABs are engulfed by preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and promote the viability of these cells. Among all osteoclast-derived extracellular vesicles, mOC-ABs had the highest osteogenic potency. We further observed that mOC-ABs had the highest vesicular receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) levels among all types of osteoclast-derived extracellular vesicles. Of note, masking of vesicular RANK by soluble RANKL strongly abolished the osteogenic potency of osteoclast-derived ABs. Mechanistically, we found that mOC-ABs induce osteoblast differentiation by activatingPI3K/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling. In conclusion, OC-ABs promote osteogenic differentiation by stimulating osteoblast differentiation via activation of RANKL reverse signaling. These findings provide important insights into the reversal phase between the bone resorption and formation stages during bone remodeling and identify an AB-dependent cellular signaling mechanism in osteoclast–osteoblast coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2948531058,"During infection, the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus forms biofilms that enhance its resistance to antimicrobials and host defenses. An integral component of the biofilm matrix is galactosaminogalactan (GAG), a cationic polymer of α-1,4-linked galactose and partially deacetylated N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). Recent studies have shown that recombinant hydrolase domains from Sph3, an A. fumigatus glycoside hydrolase involved in GAG synthesis, and PelA, a multifunctional protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in Pel polysaccharide biosynthesis, can degrade GAG, disrupt A. fumigatus biofilms, and attenuate fungal virulence in a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. The molecular mechanisms by which these enzymes disrupt biofilms have not been defined. We hypothesized that the hydrolase domains of Sph3 and PelA (Sph3h and PelAh, respectively) share structural and functional similarities given their ability to degrade GAG and disrupt A. fumigatus biofilms. MALDI-TOF enzymatic fingerprinting and NMR experiments revealed that both proteins are retaining endo-α-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminidases with a minimal substrate size of seven residues. The crystal structure of PelAh was solved to 1.54 A and structure alignment to Sph3h revealed that the enzymes share similar catalytic site residues. However, differences in the substrate-binding clefts result in distinct enzyme-substrate interactions. PelAh hydrolyzed partially deacetylated substrates better than Sph3h, a finding that agrees well with PelAh's highly electronegative binding cleft versus the neutral surface present in Sph3h. Our insight into PelAh's structure and function necessitate the creation of a new glycoside hydrolase family, GH166, whose structural and mechanistic features, along with those of GH135 (Sph3), are reported here."
https://openalex.org/W3105605981,"There is a supermassive black hole of mass 4 × 106 solar masses at the centre of the Milky Way1,2. A large reservoir of hot (107 kelvin) and cooler (102 to 104 kelvin) gas surrounds it within a few parsecs3. Although constraints on the amount of hot gas in the accretion zone of the black hole-that is, within 105 Schwarzschild radii (0.04 parsecs)-have been provided by X-ray observations4-6, the mass in cooler gas has been unconstrained. One possible way this cooler gas could be detected is by its emission in hydrogen recombination spectral lines7,8. Here we report imaging of a 104-kelvin ionized gas disk within 2 × 104 Schwarzschild radii, using the 1.3-millimetre recombination line H30α. This emission line is double-peaked, with full velocity linewidth of about 2,200 kilometres per second. The emission is centred on the radio source Sagittarius A*, but the redshifted side is displaced 0.11 arcsec (0.004 parsecs at a distance of 8 kiloparsecs) to the northeast and the blueshifted side is displaced a similar distance to the southwest. We interpret these observations in terms of a rotating disk of mass 10-5 to 10-4 solar masses and mean hydrogen density of about 105 to 106 per cubic centimetre, with the values being sensitive to the assumed geometry. The emission is stronger than expected, given the upper limit on the strength of the Brγ spectral line of hydrogen. We suggest that the H30α transition is enhanced by maser emission."

Although hypoxia has been shown to up-regulate MALAT1, only hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have been implicated in activation of the MALAT1 promoter in specific cell types and other molecular mechanisms associated with hypoxia-mediated MALAT1 up-regulation remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia induces cancer cell-specific chromatin–chromatin interactions between newly identified enhancer-like cis-regulatory elements present at the MALAT1 locus. We show that hypoxia-mediated up-regulation of MALAT1 as well as its antisense strand TALAM1 occurs in breast cancer cells, but not in nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Our analyses on the MALAT1 genomic locus discovered three novel putative enhancers that are located upstream and downstream of the MALAT1 gene body. We found that parts of these putative enhancers are epigenetically modified to a more open chromatin state under hypoxia in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our chromosome conformation capture experiment demonstrated that noncancerous cells and breast cancer cells exhibit different interaction profiles under both normoxia and hypoxia, and only breast cancer cells gain specific chromatin interactions under hypoxia. Although the HIF-2α protein can enhance the interaction between the promoter and the putative 3′ enhancer, the gain of chromatin interactions associated with other upstream elements, such as putative −7 and −20 kb enhancers, were HIF-independent events.

However, mechanisms that cause HIF-independent gene regulation are largely unexplored and demonstration of these pathways and transcription factors relevant to cancer progression remain elusive.

However, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the MALAT1 genomic locus contains potential distal enhancers upstream and downstream of the MALAT1 gene body and these regions are involved in long-range chromatin interactions in breast cancer. Importantly, hypoxia modifies histone markers resulting in more open chromatin and induces chromatin interactions in the MALAT1 locus in breast cancer cells. Although HIF facilitates the interaction between the MALAT1 promoter and the enhancer located downstream of the gene, other hypoxia-induced chromatin–chromatin interactions between the potential enhancer regions are HIF-independent, they only occur in breast cancer cell lines and they are not observed in nontumorigenic mammary lines. These findings suggest that the MALAT1 enhancers have a hypoxic-specific response in the cancer condition. To determine the expression level of MALAT1 in different subtypes of breast cancer cells, we performed Northern blotting using RNA isolated from nine cancer lines encompassing each subtype: luminal A (MCF7, T47D), luminal B (BT474, MDA-MB-361, ZR-75-30), HER2-enriched (MDA-MB-453, SKBR3), and triple-negative (MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231). MCF10A was also included as a nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line. We observed high levels of MALAT1 expression in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2-enriched breast cancer cells compared with triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and MCF10A. All three cell lines of the luminal B subtype breast cancer cells had the highest expression levels of MALAT1. This result demonstrated that the MALAT1 expression level is indeed higher in breast cancer cell lines compared with that of a nontumorigenic line (Fig. 1A). To examine how hypoxia affects MALAT1 expression in these cells, we exposed nine of these cell lines to either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for 24 h prior to RNA isolation. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) data demonstrated that under hypoxia all breast cancer lines increased expression of MALAT1 relative to normoxic levels (Fig. 1B). Hypoxia-mediated up-regulation of MALAT1 is more noticeable in the cell lines with low MALAT1 expression under normoxia (MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MCF7), compared with the cell lines with the highest MALAT1 expression in normoxia (BT474, MDA-MB-361). Surprisingly, MCF10A did not show any changes in MALAT1 expression under hypoxia (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrated that hypoxia strongly induces MALAT1 expression in breast cancer cells, but not in nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that antisense transcripts are lowly expressed noncoding RNAs transcribed from the opposite strand of coding or noncoding RNAs which then, in many cases, regulate expression of the sense transcript (27Pelechano V. Steinmetz L.M. Gene regulation by antisense transcription.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14 (24217315): 880-89310.1038/nrg3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The MALAT1 locus contains an antisense transcript called TALAM1 (Fig. 1C), which promotes MALAT1 up-regulation via 3′ end processing (28Zong X. Nakagawa S. Freier S.M. Fei J. Ha T. Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Natural antisense RNA promotes 3′ end processing and maturation of MALAT1 lncRNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26826711): 2898-290810.1093/nar/gkw047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because MALAT1 was overexpressed under hypoxia and these two RNAs engage in a positive feedback loop with each other, we examined if hypoxia could also up-regulate TALAM1. We used a strand-specific primer (SSP) strategy devised by Zong et al. (28Zong X. Nakagawa S. Freier S.M. Fei J. Ha T. Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Natural antisense RNA promotes 3′ end processing and maturation of MALAT1 lncRNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26826711): 2898-290810.1093/nar/gkw047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to differentiate MALAT1 and TALAM1 (Fig. 1D), as regular reverse transcription and PCR cannot discriminate between sense and antisense transcripts. We used a linker sequence not found in the human genome fused to an antisense oligo specific for either MALAT1 or TALAM1 for cDNA synthesis. qPCR amplified an SSP forward primer with a reverse primer for the linker sequence. The result demonstrated no hypoxia-mediated up-regulation of MALAT1 in MCF10A and accordingly no change was found in TALAM1 expression under hypoxia (Fig. 1E). In contrast, when we examined expression of MALAT1 and TALAM1 in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line, both transcripts were significantly up-regulated under hypoxia (Fig. 1E). These expression profiles are consistent with increased MALAT1 transcription under hypoxia and provide support for the importance of this locus in cancer cells. Having determined that hypoxia up-regulates MALAT1, we next sought to find a candidate factor that would function as a transcriptional activator in this process. We considered HIF-1α or HIF-2α as potential candidates, given their regulation of MALAT1 in various tissues under hypoxia (22Choudhry H. Schödel J. Oikonomopoulos S. Camps C. Grampp S. Harris A.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Ragoussis J. Mole D.R. Extensive regulation of the non-coding transcriptome by hypoxia: role of HIF in releasing paused RNApol2.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15 (24363272): 70-7610.1002/embr.201337642Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Luo F.

Oncol. 2016; 49 (27499160): 1731-173610.3892/ijo.2016.3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To examine whether HIFs are required for MALAT1 up-regulation under hypoxia, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown either HIF protein alone or in combination with each other. Knockdown of HIF-1α and HIF-2α was confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1A). We next measured the effect of HIF knockdown on the well-known HIF target genes CAIX and PAI1 and found both mRNAs were reduced by HIF depletion (Fig. 2B). Under this condition, we observed a slight, yet significant, decrease of MALAT1 by HIF-2α knockdown alone (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the previous observation on HIF-1α function as a repressor of HIF-2α expression in MCF7 cells (29Stiehl D.P. Bordoli M.R. Abreu-Rodríguez I. Wollenick K. Schraml P. Gradin K. Poellinger L. Kristiansen G. Wenger R.H. Non-canonical HIF-2α function drives autonomous breast cancer cell growth via an AREG–EGFR/ErbB4 autocrine loop.Oncogene. 2012; 31 (21927022): 2283-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), our result showed that the combinational treatment of HIF-1α siRNA and HIF-2α siRNA abrogated the effect of HIF-2α siRNA on a marginal decrease of MALAT1. We further examined the role of only HIF-2α in MALAT1 up-regulation by transfecting MCF7 cells with a plasmid encoding a constitutively active form of HIF-2α (HIF2α-CA) with P405A and P531A point mutations (pcDNA-HA-HIF2α-P405A/P531A), rendering the protein stable in the presence of oxygen (30Yan Q. Bartz S. Mao M. Li L. Kaelin W.G. The hypoxia-inducible factor 2α N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation domains cooperate to promote renal tumorigenesis in vivo.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27 (17220275): 2092-210210.1128/MCB.01514-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We confirmed HIF2α-CA overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels and up-regulation of PAI1, a HIF-target gene (Fig. 2D and Fig. S1B). Under this condition, we found that MALAT1 was up-regulated about 1.3-fold (Fig. 2E). To further verify the minor role of HIF-2α in MALAT1, we treated MCF7 cells with cobalt chloride (CoCl2), which prevents the degradation of the α subunits of HIF under normoxic conditions (31Yuan Y. Hilliard G. Ferguson T. Millhorn D.E. Cobalt inhibits the interaction between hypoxia-inducible factor-α and von Hippel-Lindau protein by direct binding to hypoxia-inducible factor-α.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15911-1591610.1074/jbc.M300463200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), resulting in increased levels of the HIF2α proteins (Fig. 2F). Upon CoCl2 treatment, we observed only a 1.5-fold increase in MALAT1 expression in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2G), indicating that CoCl2-mediated HIF-stabilization is not sufficient to fully recapitulate the effect of hypoxia. Therefore, it is likely that additional, HIF-independent changes are necessary to fully activate MALAT1 expression in breast cancer cells under hypoxia. To address whether any cis-elements present near the MALAT1 gene are involved in hypoxia-induced MALAT1 expression, we extensively analyzed various chromatin marks and transcription factor binding patterns at the MALAT1 locus using ENCODE chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data. Interestingly, besides the known promoter area, we found multiple sites containing the active enhancer/promoter marks histone-3 lysine-4 methylation (mono-methylation, H3K4me1; tri-methylation, H3K4me3) and histone-3 lysine-27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) as well as RNA polymerase II occupancy and transcription factor-binding sites in the sequence upstream of the MALAT1 transcription start site (TSS) and downstream of the transcription termination site (Fig. 3A). Based on enrichment levels of these chromatin features, we propose three putative enhancer regions for MALAT1. These enhancer regions are located between −21.4 and −17.6 kb and −11.1 and −2.7 kb upstream of the TSS of the MALAT1 gene, and between +8.4 and +11 kb, which is the region located immediately downstream of the 3′ end of the MALAT1 gene. We named these putative enhancers −20 kb enhancer, −7 kb enhancer, and 3′ enhancer, respectively (Fig. 3A). Examination of the mouse genome for orthologous sequence revealed each of these putative enhancer elements were conserved at the genetic and epigenetic levels (Fig. S2), supporting a potential functional role. It is known that as a stress response to hypoxia, a selective group of genes are up-regulated, in part due to an increase of active epigenetic markers such as H3K4me3 at their promoters (32Johnson A.B. Denko N. Barton M.C. Hypoxia induces a novel signature of chromatin modifications and global repression of transcription.Mutat.

Therefore, we questioned if hypoxia alters the chromatin status of the MALAT1 promoter or these potential enhancers regions. Nine sites throughout the promoter and putative enhancers were selected to determine whether histone modifications occupancy changed under hypoxia by ChIP-qPCR (Fig. 3A). The P1 locus is found approximately −20.5 kb upstream of the MALAT1 TSS and is within the putative −20 kb enhancer. The P2 locus is at −15.9 kb upstream and is not contained within any putative enhancer. The putative −7 kb enhancer contains two primer sets at each end, P3 and P4, at −9.2 and −4.7 kb, respectively. The P5 locus is at −2.2 kb and is not contained within any putative enhancer. We designed three primer sets for the promoter regions; the P6 locus at −0.8 kb for the upstream promoter, and the P7 locus at +0.8 kb and the P8 locus at +1.4 kb for the internal promoter. Finally, the P9 locus is at +9.2 kb and covers the putative 3′ enhancer. We performed ChIP-qPCR at the genomic loci P1–P9 under normoxia and hypoxia in the nontumorigenic MCF10A and tumorigenic MCF7 cell lines for the histone modifications H3K27Ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3, then calculated the log-fold change of the ratio of hypoxic to normoxic enrichment of each histone modification. Our ChIP-qPCR results revealed distinct levels of histone modifications between these cell lines. In MCF10A cells, the active enhancer/promoter marker H3K27Ac was enriched at P2, P5, and P9 and decreased at the other six loci under hypoxia (Fig. 3B). Active enhancer marker H3K4me1 levels showed fewer changes in MCF10A cells in response to hypoxia, only increasing at P8 and staying unchanged at P5, whereas decreasing at all other loci (Fig. 3C). Active promoter marker H3K4me3 levels were increased at P1, P7, and P8 but sharply decreased at all other loci, including the P6 locus covering the upstream promoter (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, we found strikingly different patterns of histone modifications in response to hypoxia in MCF7 cells. Changes in H3K27Ac levels were overall similar to MCF10A, with enrichment at P4, P5, and P9 under hypoxia (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we found significant increases of the H3K4me1 level under hypoxia compared with normoxia at seven of nine sites examined (except for the P6 and P7 sites) (Fig. 3C). In addition, we detected that the level of H3K4me3 increased at both the upstream and internal promoter loci (P6 and P7, respectively), a part of the putative −7 kb enhancer and its downstream region (P4 and P5) as well as the putative 3′ enhancer (P9) under hypoxia in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3D). In summary, all three histone markers showed enrichment at the loci of P4 (putative −7 kb enhancer), P5 (downstream of the −7kb enhancer), and P9 (putative 3′ enhancer) in MCF7 under hypoxia, whereas only H3K27Ac was enriched at P5 and P9 in MCF10A. These data demonstrate that the −7 kb enhancer and its downstream region as well as the 3′ enhancer are modified to open, active chromatin in breast cancer in response to hypoxia, but these modifications do not occur in nontumorigenic mammary cells. Although H3K4me3 has traditionally been considered as an active promoter mark, a recent study demonstrated that active enhancers are also highly enriched with H3K4me3 modification (34Pekowska A. Benoukraf T. Zacarias-Cabeza J. Belhocine M. Koch F. Holota H. Imbert J. Andrau J.C. Ferrier P. Spicuglia S. H3K4 tri-methylation provides an epigenetic signature of active enhancers.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21847099): 4198-421010.1038/emboj.2011.295Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because our ChIP-qPCR data demonstrated greater enrichment of H3K27Ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 under hypoxia at multiple loci within the putative MALAT1 enhancers in breast cancer, we hypothesized that these regions may be in a more open chromatin state under hypoxia and become proximal to each other as well as with the MALAT1 promoter region to facilitate transcription. We tested this possibility using chromosome conformation capture (3C) (Fig. 4A). A dual-digest strategy with the restriction enzymes BamHI and BglII was selected given their complementary overhangs, which yielded 12 restriction sites throughout the MALAT1 genomic locus (Fig. 4B), stopping at −24 kb upstream due to the absence of histone modifications at this locus and further upstream (Fig. 3A). Fragments were named for their distance from the MALAT1 3′ end (fragments A–J), with the fragment containing the MALAT1 gene body omitted (Fig. 4B). Comparison of the fragments with the loci of our putative enhancers indicated that the putative −20 kb enhancer is contained within fragments H and I. The vast majority of the putative −7 kb enhancer is contained within fragme"

We used multiplexed immunofluorescence to elucidate cellular spatial interactions and T-cell infiltrations in metastatic melanoma tumor microenvironment. We developed two novel computational approaches that enable infiltration clustering and single cell analysis-cell aggregate algorithm and cell neighborhood analysis algorithm-to reveal and to compare the spatial distribution of various immune cells relative to tumor cell in sub-anatomic tumor microenvironment areas. We showed that the heterogeneous tumor human leukocyte antigen-1 expressions differently affect the magnitude of cytotoxic T-cell infiltration and the distributions of CD20+ B cells and CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells within and outside of T-cell infiltrated tumor areas. In a cohort of 166 stage III melanoma samples, high tumor human leukocyte antigen-1 expression is required but not sufficient for high T-cell infiltration, with significantly improved overall survival. Our results demonstrate that tumor cells with heterogeneous properties are associated with differential but predictable distributions of immune cells within heterogeneous tumor microenvironment with various biological features and impacts on clinical outcomes. It establishes tools necessary for systematic analysis of the tumor microenvironment, allowing the elucidation of the homogeneous patterns within the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2948291975,"The cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway plays an important role in the detection of viral and bacterial pathogens in animals. Previous studies have shown that the metazoan second messenger cyclic [G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] (2′,3′-cGAMP) generated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase cGAS binds STING with high affinity compared with bacterial CDNs such as c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP, and 3′,3′-cGAMP. Despite recent progress indicating that the CDN-binding domain (CBD) of dimeric STING binds asymmetric 2′,3′-cGAMP preferentially over symmetric 3′,3′-CDNs, it remains an open question whether STING molecules, such as human STING, adopt a symmetric dimeric conformation to efficiently engage its asymmetric ligand. Here, structural studies of the CBD from porcine STING (STINGCBD) in complex with CDNs at 1.76–2.6 Å resolution revealed that porcine STINGCBD, unlike its human and mouse counterparts, can adopt an asymmetric ligand-binding pocket to accommodate the CDNs. We observed that the extensive interactions and shape complementarity between asymmetric 2′,3′-cGAMP and the ligand-binding pocket make it the most preferred ligand for porcine STING and that geometry constraints limit the binding between symmetric 3′,3′-CDN and porcine STING.

We observed that the extensive interactions and shape complementarity between asymmetric 2′,3′-cGAMP and the ligand-binding pocket make it the most preferred ligand for porcine STING and that geometry constraints limit the binding between symmetric 3′,3′-CDN and porcine STING. The ligand-discrimination mechanism of porcine STING observed here expands our understanding of how the CDN–STING pathway is activated and of its role in antiviral defense."

The thermal degradation process of PDMAEMA was investigated. The polymer was heated at specific time intervals, then heating was stopped, and infrared analysis was performed to obtain information on the structure of the solid residue. The thermal degradation process has a two-stage character. The limit temperature for the first decomposition step was about 390°C, after which the second stage of sample decomposition began. The order of disintegration of the macromolecules was determined. Activation energy values for the thermal decomposition process have been calculated; they are 89.8 kJ/mol for the first stage and 17.7 kJ/mol for the second stage of the degradation process."

However, little is known about its effect on fetal metabolism and development. Here, a sheep model was used to explore whether maternal undernutrition induces fetal lipid metabolism disorder and further inhibits fetal hepatic development. Twenty pregnant ewes were either fed normally or restricted to 30% level for 15 d, after which fetal hepatic samples were collected to conduct transcriptome, metabolome, histomorphology, and biochemical analysis. Results showed that maternal undernutrition altered the general transcriptome profile and metabolic mode in fetal liver. Fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis were enhanced in fetal livers of undernourished ewes, which might be promoted by the activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α signaling pathway, whereas cholesterol, steroid, and fatty acid synthesis were repressed. Maternal undernutrition increased triglyceride synthesis, decreased triglyceride degradation, and inhibited phospholipid degradation and synthesis in fetal liver. In addition, our data revealed that maternal undernutrition extremely inhibited DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and antiapoptosis and broke the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis in fetal liver, indicating that maternal undernutrition affects the growth and development of fetal liver. Generally, these findings provide evidence that maternal undernutrition during pregnancy disturbs fetal lipid metabolism and inhibits fetal hepatic development in sheep, which greatly contribute to the further study of fetal metabolism and development in human beings.—Xue, Y., Guo, C., Hu, F., Zhu, W., Mao, S.

We hypothesized that loss of Cyp26a1 activity via inducible knockout in juvenile or adult mice would result in decreased atRA clearance and increased tissue atRA concentrations and atRA-related adverse effects. To test these hypotheses, Cyp26a1 was knocked out in juvenile and adult male and female Cyp26a1 floxed mice using standard Cre–Lox technology and tamoxifen injections. Biochemical and histological methods were used to study the effects of global Cyp26a1 knockout. The Cyp26a1 knockout did not result in consistent histopathological changes in any major organs. Cyp26a1−/− mice gained weight normally and exhibited no adverse phenotypes for up to 1 year after loss of Cyp26a1 expression. Similarly, atRA concentrations were not increased in the liver, testes, spleen, or serum of these mice, and the Cyp26a1 knockout did not cause compensatory induction of lecithin:retinol acetyltransferase (Lrat) or retinol dehydrogenase 11 (Rdh11) mRNA or a decrease in aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) mRNA in the liver compared with tamoxifen-treated controls. However, the Cyp26a1−/− mice showed increased bone marrow cellularity and decreased frequency of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow consistent with a retinoid-induced myeloid skewing of hematopoiesis. In addition, the Cyp26a1 knockout decreased clearance of exogenous atRA by 70% and increased atRA half-life 6-fold. These findings demonstrate that despite lacking a major impact on endogenous atRA signaling, Cyp26a1 critically contributes as a barrier for exogenous atRA exposure.

However, the relative tissue-specific roles of individual Aldh1a and Cyp26 enzymes in regulating atRA signaling and concentrations in adult animals are not known. The understanding of the role of the individual enzymes is largely derived from knockout mice, in which the enzymes are knocked out already during fetal development (1Rhinn M. Dollé P.

Because of the significance of retinoid signaling in embryogenesis, many such knockout mice die during development (15Kedishvili N.Y. Enzymology of retinoic acid biosynthesis and degradation.J.

Inducible and tissue-specific knockout models have provided important new tools to address this issue by selectively eliminating the activity of key retinoid-metabolizing enzymes in adulthood. These models have clearly demonstrated the dichotomy of the need of specific enzymes in fetal development versus adulthood. For example, knockout of Aldh1a2 leads to lethality of the embryos early on in gestation (1Rhinn M. Dollé P.

Based on the existing data, we hypothesized that post-natal global conditional knockout of Cyp26a1 in adult or juvenile mice would result in a significant increase in tissue atRA concentrations, specifically in the liver and testis, as these tissues would have decreased clearance of atRA. We also predicted that increased atRA concentrations in plasma would result in activation of retinoid signaling and subsequent retinoid-related toxicity. These hypotheses were tested using a ROSA26CreERT to induce global knockout of the Cyp26a1 floxed allele upon treatment with tamoxifen. We aimed to determine the role of Cyp26a1 in atRA clearance and in regulating atRA signaling in juvenile and adult mice. The transgenic strains of mice were generated successfully, and Cyp26a1 was knocked out in these mice in a genotype-dependent manner by tamoxifen injections as confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1). Heterozygous Cyp26a1+/− mice were included in the analysis, as it was assumed these mice should have a 50% decrease in the expression of Cyp26a1 compared with the Cyp26a1+/+ (control) mice. The RT-PCR analysis suggested that the Cyp26a1+/− animals indeed had reduced Cyp26a1 mRNA expression compared with Cyp26a1+/+ controls (Fig. 1), although the expression levels of Cyp26a1 mRNA were highly variable. The Cyp26a1 knockout was induced in either juvenile (21 days old) or adult mice (60 days old) to explore possible differences in the role of Cyp26a1 in the different ages of mice. Following the tamoxifen injections, the Cyp26a1−/− mice gained weight at similar pace as their Cyp26a1+/+ controls (Fig. 2), and the mice showed no gross physical or behavior abnormalities and showed normal grooming. When Cyp26a1 knockout was induced in juvenile animals, the male Cyp26a1−/− mice gained weight faster than the controls (p < 0.0001), but this effect was not reproduced in the female mice or in the male mice in which Cyp26a1 was knocked out in adulthood (Fig. 2), suggesting this was a transient effect. Overall, selective loss of Cyp26a1 activity appeared to have no obvious adverse effects on the mice, and the mice survived up to a year after tamoxifen injections without physical or behavioral abnormalities.Figure 2Body weight gain in female (A and B) and male (C and D) Cyp26a1+/+, Cyp26a1+/−, and Cyp26a1−/− mice.

No significant histological abnormalities were noted in Cyp26a1−/− mice versus Cyp26a1+/− or Cyp26a1+/+ mice in any of the tissues analyzed (Fig. 3). All mice, including controls, had minimal to mild chronic to chronic-active inflammation of the mesenteric fat with low numbers of histiocytes with vacuolated cytoplasm, most likely related to intraperitoneal tamoxifen injections. Sporadic minimal to mild lymphocytic salivary gland adenitis, minimal hepatic necrosis, and minimal to mild gastritis were observed in mice from all genotypes, and these observations were considered background lesions. atRA has been shown to play a critical role in hematopoiesis, and Cyp26 enzymes are known to degrade atRA. Hematopoiesis in Cyp26a1−/− mice compared with Cyp26a1+/+ mice was analyzed by complete blood counts and peripheral blood flow cytometry in 9-week-old mice, 5 weeks after tamoxifen injections (Fig. 4 and Figs. S1 and S2). Peripheral blood analysis via flow cytometry showed a significant decrease in the peripheral blood CD3+ T-cells and a significant increase in the peripheral blood myeloid cells in the Cyp26a1−/− mice when compared with Cyp26a1+/+ mice. No significant differences in the B220+ B-cells were observed between the two groups (Fig. 4). To further investigate the potential impact of loss of Cyp26a1 activity on hematopoiesis, bone marrow cellularity and differentiation status were analyzed. The bone marrow cellularity of Cyp26a1−/− mice was significantly increased, whereas there was no difference in the frequency and number of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow of the Cyp26a1−/− mice when compared with Cyp26a1+/+ controls as measured by CFU cells (Fig. S3). However, when the bone marrow progenitor cell colonies were analyzed, the Cyp26a1−/− mice had significantly lower frequency and absolute number of erythroid CFUs when compared with Cyp26a1+/+ mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). In addition, the frequency of myeloid CFUs was significantly greater in Cyp26a1−/− mice when compared with Cyp26a1+/+ mice (p < 0.05), but the absolute number of myeloid CFU was not altered in Cyp26a1−/− mice (Fig. 5). The frequency or number of early progenitor cells (CFU-Mix; common myeloid progenitors, CFU mix of both erythroid and myeloid) was not different (p > 0.05) between the two groups of mice (Fig. 5). To determine whether the global elimination of Cyp26a1 in adult or juvenile mice impacts vitamin A homeostasis in select tissues or serum, atRA, retinol, and retinyl ester concentrations were measured in serum, liver, spleen, and testis of the mice (Table 1). No differences in atRA, retinol, or retinyl ester concentrations were observed between Cyp26a1−/− mice and Cyp26a1+/+ mice in serum (Fig. 6), liver (Fig. 7), testis (Fig. S4), or spleen (Fig. S5) regardless of whether Cyp26a1 was deleted in adult or in juvenile animals. Of the tissues analyzed, the liver had the highest and most variable atRA concentrations, 10–20 pmol/g, with testis concentrations being very consistent, 11–13 pmol/g. The spleen and serum atRA concentrations were over 70% lower than liver and testis, 2–4 pmol/g and 2–4 nm, respectively. Testis and spleen retinol and retinyl ester concentrations were negligible (0.3–1 nmol/g retinol and 0.8–1.6 nmol/g retinyl esters) compared with the serum concentrations of 1 μm (retinol) and liver stores of 100–200 nmol/g retinol and 200–1400 nmol/g retinyl esters (Table 1). Although this study was not designed to compare the retinoid concentrations in the mice of different ages, the data collected show that the retinyl ester and possibly retinol concentrations are lower in the liver of younger mice (Fig. 7 and Table 1).Table 1Retinoid concentrations in mouse serum and tissuesRetinyl esterRetinolatRAFemaleMaleFemaleMaleFemaleMaleμmμmnmSerumAdultCyp26a1+/+0.06 ± 0.02 (5)0.20 ± 0.21 (4)1.0 ± 0.2 (5)1.9 ± 0.1 (4)2.8 ± 0.6 (5)3.4 ± 1.0 (4)Cyp26a1+/−0.06 ± 0.04 (5)0.10 ± 0.06 (4)1.1 ± 0.2 (5)1.5 ± 0.1 (4)2.9 ± 0.4 (5)3.4 ± 0.7 (4)Cyp26a1−/−0.08 ± 0.02 (4)0.07 ± 0.02 (4)1.0 ± 0.1 (4)1.7 ± 0.1 (4)3.2 ± 0.7 (4)3.6 ± 0.8 (4)JuvenileCyp26a1+/+0.10 ± 0.07 (5)0.08 ± 0.04 (5)1.1 ± 0.1 (5)1.6 ± 0.1 (5)2.1 ± 0.7 (5)1.9 ± 0.3 (5)Cyp26a1+/−0.08aData are mean values of two samples.

Here we analyzed the role of subunit a-isoforms in the invasive mouse breast cancer cell line, 4T1-12B. Quantitation of mRNA levels for each isoform by quantitative RT-PCR revealed that a4 is the dominant isoform expressed in these cells. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to disrupt the genes encoding each of the four V-ATPase subunit a-isoforms, we found that ablation of only the a4-encoding gene significantly inhibits invasion and migration of 4T1-12B cells. Additionally, cells with disrupted a4 exhibited reduced V-ATPase expression at the leading edge, suggesting that the a4 isoform is primarily responsible for targeting the V-ATPase to the plasma membrane in 4T1-12B cells. These findings suggest that different subunit a-isoforms may direct V-ATPases to the plasma membrane of different invasive breast cancer cell lines.

Because EVAs potently inhibit inflammation in many preclinical models, highlighting their potential as biological therapeutics for inflammatory diseases, we sought to further unravel the CXC-chemokine–EVA interactions. Using yeast surface display, we identified and characterized 27 novel CXC-chemokine–binding evasins homologous to EVA3 and defined two functional classes. The first, which included EVA3, exclusively bound ELR+ CXC-chemokines, whereas the second class bound both ELR+ and ELR− CXC-chemokines, in several cases including CXC-motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) but, surprisingly, not CXCL8. The X-ray crystal structure of EVA3 at a resolution of 1.79 Å revealed a single antiparallel β-sheet with six conserved cysteine residues forming a disulfide-bonded knottin scaffold that creates a contiguous solvent-accessible surface. Swapping analyses identified distinct knottin scaffold segments necessary for different CXC-chemokine–binding activities, implying that differential ligand positioning, at least in part, plays a role in promiscuous binding. Swapping segments also transferred chemokine-binding activity, resulting in a hybrid EVA with dual CXCL10- and CXCL8-binding activities. The solvent-accessible surfaces of the knottin scaffold segments have distinctive shape and charge, which we suggest drives chemokine-binding specificity.

The 45–50 mammalian chemokines are small secreted proteins that are grouped into CC, CXC, XC and CX3C classes based on the spacing between N-terminal cysteine residues. Their chemotactic functions are mediated by binding to a family of G-protein coupled receptors. Chemokines are structurally conserved, with a three-stranded β-sheet, an α-helical segment, and an N-terminal unstructured region (1Kufareva I. Gustavsson M. Zheng Y. Stephens B.S. Handel T.M.

Binding of chemokines to receptors occurs via chemokine recognition site 1 (CRS1), located in the extracellular N terminus of the receptor, and CRS2, located in the seven-transmembrane bundle. CRS1 binds the proximal N terminus and N-loop/40S loop, whereas CRS2 binds the chemokine distal N terminus (3Kufareva I.

The “two-site” model has been refined more recently with the identification of further interaction sites: CRS1.5, between CRS1 and 2, which binds the conserved chemokine disulfide, and CRS0.5, at the receptor distal N terminus, which binds the β1-strand of the chemokine (3Kufareva I.

Tick evasins fall into two structurally and functionally unrelated classes. Evasins 1 and 4 (EVA1 and EVA4) are homologous, with eight conserved Cys residues, and specifically bind subsets of CC-chemokines, whereas EVA3 has six Cys residues and specifically binds a subset of ELR+ CXC-chemokines.

Many of these novel evasins have, like EVA1/EVA4, eight conserved Cys residues, and we refer to them as C8 evasins. We have also reported the identification of an EVA3 homolog, P1156, that, like EVA3, binds ELR+ CXC-chemokines (21Alenazi Y. Singh K. Davies G. Eaton J.R.O. Elders P. Kawamura A. Bhattacharya S. Genetically engineered two-warhead evasins provide a method to achieve precision targeting of disease-relevant chemokine subsets.Sci.

Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of 27 novel CXC-chemokine–binding tick evasins. Like EVA3, these novel evasins have six Cys residues, and we refer to them as C6 evasins. We found that the CXC-chemokine–binding C6 evasins can be grouped by function into two classes. Class I, which includes the class founder EVA3, binds ELR+ CXC-chemokines, including CXCL1 and/or CXCL8, whereas class II, which is novel, binds a broader range of ELR+ and ELR− chemokines but, surprisingly, does not bind CXCL8. We report the X-ray crystal structure of EVA3 and show that it has a disulfide-bonded knottin scaffold. We found that discrete segments within the knottin scaffold form a solvent-accessible contiguous surface and are necessary for specific CXC-chemokine–binding activities. Our results indicate that promiscuous but specific CXC-chemokine recognition by EVA3 and its homologs is, at least in part, mediated by differential ligand positioning on the knottin scaffold and that manipulation of this scaffold surface can be used to engineer evasins with altered properties. We identified 119 putative EVA3 homologs (including the previously reported P1156) by searching publicly available tick salivary transcriptome libraries using three iterations of psiBLAST with the EVA3 sequence as described previously (19Singh K.

We cloned cDNAs encoding the mature protein sequences from all 119 EVA3 homologs (and EVA3 itself) into three different yeast expression shuttle vectors. The three shuttle vectors were designed to fuse each tick protein with surface display tags either at the N terminus (AGA2) or at the C terminus (AGA2 and SAG1) under the control of an inducible GAL4 promoter. The plasmid library pool was amplified, transformed into yeast as a pool, and induced to express library-encoded proteins on the cell surface with galactose. The pooled yeast library was screened with individual biotinylated chemokines (CXCL1, -7, -8, -9, -10, -11, and -12) followed by streptavidin-AF647 as described previously (19Singh K. Davies G.

Briefly, labeled yeast cells were sorted by FACS using a sorting gate, which was determined by FACS analysis of the yeast cells labeled with streptavidin-AF647 alone to exclude cells that nonspecifically bound to streptavidin-AF647. Cells recovered were regrown, sorted once more, and then plated at low density, allowing individual yeast clones to be picked and retested to verify binding to the biotinylated chemokine. In these experiments, individual yeast clones were labeled with streptavidin-AF647 alone (control) and biotinylated chemokine plus streptavidin-AF647 (Table S1). Inserts from plasmid DNA extracted from yeast clones that had detectable binding (above the control threshold; Table S1) were amplified by PCR and sequenced to identify the evasin. In selected cases, yeast clones were also compared with control yeast expressing the relevant surface display tag by FACS (Fig. S1) to confirm binding to the screening chemokine. We successfully expressed EVA3 and the 28 putative evasins identified in the yeast display screen as secreted C-terminal StrepII:His-tagged proteins from HEK293F mammalian cells and purified them using nickel affinity followed by size-exclusion chromatography as described previously (19Singh K.

We initially screened a panel of human CC- and CXC-chemokines at 300 nm chemokine concentration. None of the evasins bound to CC-, CX3C-, or XC-chemokines. Several evasins that were identified by yeast surface display (e.g. those arising from the CXCL9 screen) did not bind the screening chemokine by biolayer interferometry (BLI; Table S1) but bound other CXC-chemokines in the same assay. A single evasin, P1101, which was isolated in the CXCL10 screen, did not bind any chemokine by biolayer interferometry (Fig. S3 and Table S1). The lack of concordance in these instances between yeast surface display and biolayer interferometry, which was performed using proteins produced in mammalian cells, could potentially be explained by known differences in post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and sialylation between yeast and mammalian cells. We next performed titration assays with serial dilutions of chemokines that bound at 300 nm to determine binding affinities (Figure 1, Figure 2). Target residence times calculated from the off-rate are shown in Fig. S4. These studies identified two functional classes of EVA3 homologs. The 15 members of class I, which includes EVA3 and P1156, bind ELR+ CXC-chemokines. The 14 members of class II bind both ELR+ and ELR− CXC-chemokines (Figure 1, Figure 2). All Class I EVA3 homologs bound CXCL8 barring P1134. The 14 novel class II EVA3 homologs, in addition to their ELR+-binding activity, bound to one or more of the non-ELR chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL13, CXCL12, and CXCL4. Notably, no evasin that bound CXCL8 was found to bind an ELR− chemokine. Two closely related evasins, P1142 and P1126, both from A. cajennense, shared high-affinity (Kd < 10 nm) binding to CXCL10 and low-affinity binding (Kd > 300 nm) to CXCL11. Two other evasins, P942 and P675, from I. ricinus, had the reverse binding specificity, binding CXCL11 strongly (Kd < 20 nm) and CXCL10 weakly (Kd > 100 nm) (Figure 2, Figure 3). We also identified several evasins that bound the homeostatic chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13. In particular, P1104, from I. ricinus, bound to CXCL12. The target residence times of the novel evasins varied from brief (<1 min) to >10 min, e.g. for the binding of P1142 to CXCL10, suggesting that in some cases relatively stable evasin–chemokine complexes could form.Figure 2Summary data of chemokine binding using biolayer interferometry.

Interestingly, in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, FeCh possesses a conserved transmembrane chlorophyll a/b binding (CAB) domain that resembles the first and the third helix of light-harvesting complexes, including a chlorophyll-binding motif. Whether the FeCh CAB domain also binds chlorophyll is unknown. Here, using biochemical and radiolabeled precursor experiments, we found that partially inhibited activity of FeCh in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 leads to overproduction of chlorophyll molecules that accumulate in the thylakoid membrane and, together with carotenoids, bind to FeCh. We observed that pigments bound to purified FeCh are organized in an energy-dissipative conformation and further show that FeCh can exist in vivo as a monomer or a dimer depending on its own activity. However, pigmented FeCh was purified exclusively as a dimer. Separately expressed and purified FeCH CAB domain contained a pigment composition similar to that of full-length FeCh and retained its quenching properties. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the CAB domain was acquired by a fusion between FeCh and a single-helix, high light-inducible protein early in the evolution of cyanobacteria. Following this fusion, the FeCh CAB domain with a functional chlorophyll-binding motif was retained in all currently known cyanobacterial genomes except for a single lineage of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. Our findings indicate that FeCh from Synechocystis exists mostly as a pigment-free monomer in cells but can dimerize, in which case its CAB domain creates a functional pigment-binding segment organized in an energy-dissipating configuration.

Heme is an essential cofactor for virtually all forms of life, and it is produced by a conserved tetrapyrrole pathway.

Among many other recognized regulatory functions, heme availability controls total metabolite flow through the tetrapyrrole pathway.

In photosynthetic organisms, regulation of the tetrapyrrole pathway is more complicated, because PPIX is also a substrate for magnesium chelatase, which diverts PPIX toward the chlorophyll (Chl) branch (Fig. S1A) (4Brzezowski P.

Considering the general phototoxicity of tetrapyrroles, there must be regulatory mechanisms to prevent an overproduction of one of the tetrapyrrole products at the expense of the others or a harmful accumulation of intermediates. Thus, in Chl producing organisms, the activity of FeCh not only just controls a regulatory pool of heme but also competes with magnesium chelatase for PPIX, the last common substrate of both the heme and Chl branches. Indeed, the activity of FeCh has been shown to be crucial for the regulation of the tetrapyrrole pathway in both plants and cyanobacteria; an impairment of FeCh causes a massive accumulation of PPIX (5Papenbrock J.

The CAB domain is connected to the catalytic part of FeCh via a variable linker (Fig. 1), and in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis), the FeCh enzyme lacking both the LHC domain and the linker still appeared to be fairly active but was unstable, and its accumulation in the cell was impaired (6Sobotka R.

A truncation preserving the linker but eliminating the CAB domain yields an active and stable enzyme (29Sobotka R. Tichý M. Wilde A. Hunter C.N.

Such a truncated enzyme is, however, strictly monomeric, whereas the full-length enzyme can dimerize, at least in vitro (29Sobotka R. Tichý M. Wilde A. Hunter C.N. Functional assignments for the carboxyl-terminal domains of the ferrochelatase from Synechocystis PCC 6803: the CAB domain plays a regulatory role, and region II is essential for catalysis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 155 (21081693): 1735-174710.1104/pp.110.167528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Storm P.

In addition, a Synechocystis strain expressing FeCh without the CAB domain was sensitive to high light conditions (29Sobotka R. Tichý M. Wilde A. Hunter C.N. Functional assignments for the carboxyl-terminal domains of the ferrochelatase from Synechocystis PCC 6803: the CAB domain plays a regulatory role, and region II is essential for catalysis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 155 (21081693): 1735-174710.1104/pp.110.167528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that Synechocystis FeCh is present in the cell mostly as a pigment-less monomer but can conditionally dimerize, and in such cases, its CAB domain creates a functional pigment-binding segment. Interestingly, the Chl and carotenoids bound to the CAB domain are organized in an energy-dissipative configuration, as previously reported for Hlips (24Staleva H. Komenda J. Shukla M.K. Šlouf V. Kaňa R. Polívka T. Sobotka R. Mechanism of photoprotection in the cyanobacterial ancestor of plant antenna proteins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (25706339): 287-29110.1038/nchembio.1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis, suggesting that the FeCh CAB domain originates from a fusion between an ancient Hlip and FeCh enzyme early in cyanobacterial evolution. To address the longstanding question of whether the FeCh enzyme in oxygenic phototrophs can bind Chl, we affinity-purified a 3×FLAG-tagged version of FeCh (f.FeCh; Fig. 1) ectopically expressed in a Synechocystis strain with the original hemH gene deleted (29Sobotka R. Tichý M. Wilde A. Hunter C.N. Functional assignments for the carboxyl-terminal domains of the ferrochelatase from Synechocystis PCC 6803: the CAB domain plays a regulatory role, and region II is essential for catalysis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 155 (21081693): 1735-174710.1104/pp.110.167528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The obtained eluate was further separated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and the Chl absorbance was measured by a diode-array detector. However, the only detectable Chl in the eluate comigrated with traces of photosystem I complexes (PSI) and with detergent micelles (DDM), but not with the purified f.FeCh (Fig. 2A). The FeCh, migrating close to DDM micelles, was the only protein detectable on the stained gel after the separation of all fractions collected from the SEC column (Fig. S2). It should be noted that PSI complexes are extremely Chl-rich (90 Chl molecules per monomeric PSI), and thus their Chl absorbance is typically detectable even if the level of PSI protein subunits is below the detection limit of our protein stain (compare Fig. 1A and Fig. S2). We hypothesized that the FeCh could only bind (sense) Chl molecules if there was an abnormally large pool of unbound “free” Chl in the thylakoid membranes. Low FeCh activity in Synechocystis was previously shown to up-regulate the levels of Chl precursors (6Sobotka R. McLean S. Žuberová M. Hunter C.N. Tichý M. The C-terminal extension of ferrochelatase is critical for enzyme activity and for functioning of the tetrapyrrole pathway in Synechocystis strain PCC 6803.J.

To clarify this point we treated the Synechocystis cells with a specific FeCh inhibitor, N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (MPP) (32Shipovskov S. Karlberg T. Fodje M. Hansson M.D. Ferreira G.C. Hansson M. Reimann C.T. Al-Karadaghi S. Metallation of the transition-state inhibitor N-methyl mesoporphyrin by ferrochelatase: Implications for the catalytic reaction mechanism.J. Mol.

After 4 h of the MPP treatment, the cells were fed with 14C-labeled glutamate to follow the rate of de novo Chl formation. The concentration of MPP (275 nm) was not significantly toxic to Synechocystis under our standard conditions, because the proliferation rate of the cells treated with this concentration of MPP for 24 h was only 6% slower than that of untreated cells (Fig. S3). However, the partial FeCh inhibition significantly accelerated Chl biosynthesis compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Further, to assess the amount of free (or loosely bound) Chl in the cell, the membrane fraction was isolated after 4 h of MPP-treatment and separated by clear-native electrophoresis. In the case of MPP-treated cells, the Chl fluorescence detected in the zone of free pigments (DDM micelles) was more than doubled than in untreated control (Fig. 4, A and B). We eluted and quantified pigments from this part of the gel, and the content of Chl correlated well with the fluorescence measurement (Fig. 4B). According to these results, ∼0.7% of the total Chl loaded on the clear-native gel comigrated with DDM micelles, and this amount is roughly doubled after treatment with MPP (Fig. 4B). Given these results, we concluded that decreased FeCh activity results in excess production of Chl in the cell.Figure 4Oversynthesized Chl accumulates in thylakoid membranes. A, membrane complexes prepared from WT and from WT treated for 4 h with MPP were separated by clear native electrophoresis on 4–12% acrylamide gel and scanned (left panel); 4 μg of Chl was loaded per each sample. Chl fluorescence (right panel, Chl FL) in the gel was detected after excitation with blue light. PSI[1] and PSI[3], monomeric and trimeric photosystem I, respectively. PSII[1] and PSII[2], monomeric and dimeric photosystem II, respectively. Pigments migrating in gel with DDM micelles are indicated by dotted boxes. B, Chl fluorescence in the gel region marked by dotted boxes in A was quantified. This part of gel was further cut, the pigments were eluted by repeated incubation in an elution buffer containing DDM (see “Experimental procedures”), and the Chl content was quantified by HPLC. Error bars show S.D., n = 3 independent experiments. C, membrane complexes prepared from WT and hemH-Δ324 mutant were separated by clear native electrophoresis, and Chl fluorescence was detected as described for A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Notably, when we purified f.FeCh from the cells treated with MPP, it eluted from the SEC column as a higher-mass protein complex than when it was purified from cells without the inhibitor. Moreover, a peak of Chl absorbance (675 nm) clearly comigrated with the f.FeCh (Fig. 2B), and the absorbance spectrum of the f.FeCh peak (450–500 nm region; Fig. 2C) also signaled the presence of carotenoids. We extracted pigments from the collected f.FeCh peak and separated the extract by HPLC, which revealed a complex mixture of carotenoids in addition to Chl molecules. β-Carotene (β-car) was the most abundant carotenoid but zeaxanthin, echinenone, and an unknown carotenoid species were present as well (Fig. 2D). We also found MPP bound to f.FeCh, which explains the high absorbance of f.FeCh in the blue spectral region (Fig. 2C and Fig. S4). By recording Chl fluorescence during SEC, we discovered that the fluorescence of Chl molecules bound to f.FeCh is quenched: the fluorescence yield of Chl was only ∼14% when compared with the fluorescence of Chl molecules in detergent micelles (Fig. 5). From these observations, we conclude that the Synechocystis FeCh possesses a functional Chl and carotenoid-binding motif, which coordinates pigments in an energy-dissipative configuration. Based on the elution time from the SEC column, the apparent mass of f.FeCh was greater after incubation with MPP (Fig. 2, A and B). However, on the stained gel, we detected no other proteins except f.FeCh (Fig. S2), which implies the formation of a f.FeCh oligomer. According to the known structure of LHCII (33Liu Z. Yan H.

The observed shift in f.FeCh mobility suggests that the capability of the Synechocystis FeCh to bind Chl is related to its dimerization. To exclude the possibility that the f.FeCh oligomerization is an artifact of protein purification or its tagging, we separated Synechocystis membrane complexes by SEC and immunodetected FeCh in the collected minute fractions. A similar shift in the mass of FeCh was detected in membranes from WT cells: MPP treatment resulted in a higher-mass FeCh complex (Fig. 6A). According to the column calibration (Fig. S5), this shift corresponds to 50 kDa, which is very close to the shift expected for the presence of a FeCh dimer. Therefore, the discrepancy (∼2 min) in the elution times of FeCh and f.FeCh from the SEC column is most likely because of the presence of the highly charged 3×FLAG tag. To verify the inducible FeCh dimerization by an independent approach, we separated WT membrane proteins by 2D blue-native/SDS electrophoresis (BN/SDS-PAGE), blotted, and immunodetected FeCh. Although the FeCh pattern was a bit smeared, after treatment with MPP, it was evident that a new spot corresponding to a size of a FeCh dimer appeared (Fig. 6B). We repeated the same experiment using membranes isolated from the Synechocystis hemH-Δ347 strain containing FeCh without the CAB domain (Fig. 1) (29Sobotka R. Tichý M. Wilde A. Hunter C.N. Functional assignments for the carboxyl-terminal domains of the ferrochelatase from Synechocystis PCC 6803: the CAB domain plays a regulatory role, and region II is essential for catalysis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 155 (21081693): 1735-174710.1104/pp.110.167528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As expected, the FeCh-Δ347 enzyme was exclusively monomeric, and its mobility was not affected by MPP (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate that the Synechocystis FeCh can exist in vivo as a monomer or as a homodimer, and the formation of FeCh dimer is stimulated by MPP. To prove that the FeCh CAB domain is the pigment-binding site, the FeCh C terminus, including the linker, was expressed in Synechocystis as a His6-tagged protein (His-C-tn, 9 kDa; Fig. 1).

Perspective VA healthcare system. Methods We used a propensity score-adjusted hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and 2010–2013 VA administrative data to estimate differences in VA healthcare costs, pain intensity (0–10 numerical rating scale), and opioid use between CIH users and nonusers. We identified CIH use in Veterans’ medical records through Current Procedural Terminology, VA workload tracking, and provider-type codes. Results We identified 30,634 younger Veterans with chronic MSD pain as using CIH and 195,424 with no CIH use. CIH users differed from nonusers across all baseline covariates except the Charlson comorbidity index. They also differed on annual pre-CIH-start healthcare costs ($10,729 versus $5,818), pain (4.33 versus 3.76), and opioid use (66.6% versus 54.0%). The HLM results indicated lower annual healthcare costs (-$637; 95% CI: -$1,023, -$247), lower pain (-0.34; -0.40, -0.27), and slightly higher (less than a percentage point) opioid use (0.8; 0.6, 0.9) for CIH users in the year after CIH start. Sensitivity analyses indicated similar results for three most-used CIH approaches (acupuncture, chiropractic care, and massage), but higher costs for those with eight or more CIH visits. Conclusions On average CIH use appears associated with lower healthcare costs and pain and slightly higher opioid use in this population of younger Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Given the VA’s growing interest in the use of CIH, further, more detailed analyses of its impacts are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2948816524,"Tropical tuna support some of the largest and most valuable artisanal and industrial fisheries worldwide, conducted to a large degree with Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). Yellowfin, bigeye and skipjack are the main tuna species found in mixed aggregations around FADs and they are simultaneously encircled by the purse seining operation. One of the key challenges that purse seine fleets fishing with drifting FADs face in all oceans is to be able to target species in healthy condition such as skipjack, while reducing impacts on bigeye and yellowfin in areas where there is a need to reduce fishing pressure on these species. The present paper explores a technical solution for selective fishing at FADs by means of acoustic equipment used by purse seiners. Acoustic frequency response of skipjack and bigeye tuna were determined at 38, 120 and 200 kHz. Skipjack showed stronger response at higher frequencies. On the contrary, bigeye showed stronger responses at lower frequencies. The robust pattern shown in frequency responses of the two species demonstrates the potential to predict abundance and species proportions based on purely acoustic measures. The paper also addresses the conditions that need to be met to successfully apply this technology for selective fishing as well as other uses of direct acoustic observations to support tuna conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2948468868,"The deterioration of water quality has become a primary environmental concern worldwide. Understanding the status of water quality and identifying the influencing factors are important for water resources management. However, reported analyses have mostly been conducted in small and focused areas. It is still unclear if factors driving spatial variation in water quality would be different in extended spatial scales. In this paper, we analyzed spatial pattern of inland surface water quality in China using a dataset with four water quality parameters (i.e., pH, DO, NH4+-N and CODMn) and the water quality level. We tested the effects of anthropogenic (i.e., land use and socio-economic) and natural (i.e., climatic and topographic) factors on spatial variation in water quality. The study concluded that the overall inland surface water quality in China was at level III (fair). Water quality level was strongly correlated with CODMn and NH4+-N concentration. In contrast to reported studies that suggested land use patterns were the determinants of inland surface water quality, this study revealed that both anthropogenic and natural factors played important roles in explaining spatial variation of inland surface water quality in China. Among the tested explanatory variables, mean elevation within watershed appeared as the best predictor for pH, while annual precipitation and mean air temperature were the most important explanatory variables for CODMn and DO, respectively. NH4+-N concentration and water quality level were most strongly correlated with the percent of forest cover in watershed. Compared to studies at smaller spatial scales, this study found different influencing factors of surface water quality, suggesting that factors may play different roles at different spatial scales of consideration. Therefore management policies and measures in water quality control must be established and implemented accordingly. Since currently adopted parameters for monitoring of inland surface water quality in China are largely influenced by natural variables, additional physicochemical and biological indicators are needed for a robust assessment of human impacts on water quality."

The aim of this study was to investigate the use of PODXL, BCL7B, ARHGEF4, and the integrin family member ITGB1 as useful markers for the prognosis of postoperative pancreatic cancer patients in comparison with tumor size and the tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an anti-ITGB1 antibody on 102 samples of pancreatic cancer tissue surgically resected at the University of Kochi Medical School Hospital and the Matsuyama Shimin Hospital. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that TNM stage and overexpression of PODXL, BCL7B, and ITGB1 were correlated with postoperative survival. However, tumor size was not significantly associated with postoperative prognosis of pancreatic cancer compared to these features. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the overexpression of both PODXL and ITGB1 and overexpression of both BCL7B and ITGB1 increased the hazard ratio (6.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.58–15.21; and 3.93, 95% CI 1.74–8.91, respectively) compared to that of TNM stage (IIA and IIB vs. III and IV; 3.05, 95% CI 1.25–7.42). These results imply that the combination of PODXL with ITGB1 and the combination of BCL7B with ITGB1 accurately predicted the postoperative outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients, and they were superior compared to the TNM staging system. The combination of PODXL with ITGB1 would be particularly useful, as it was the most highly correlated with postoperative outcomes. Importantly, the present results are useful to determine which adjuvant therapy should be selected."
https://openalex.org/W2948611141,"Ground beef makes up more than half of the beef consumed in the U.S. market. Although numerous studies have been conducted on microbial safety and shelf life of ground beef limited work has been done using a culture-independent approach. While past studies have allowed for the evaluation of a few organisms of interest, there is limited work on the microbial community associated with fresh ground beef. In order to have a more complete picture of the microbial ecology of the product, a culture-independent approach utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used. The objectives of this study were to characterize the fresh ground beef microbiome and the effect that antimicrobial interventions and antioxidants, applied to beef trim before grinding, and product storage have on community composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Beef trimmings were treated with antimicrobials and an antioxidant. Samples were ground, loafed, and overwrapped before being packaged in modified-atmosphere packaging. Samples were in dark storage for 21 days followed by five days in retail display. Periodically during storage, samples were collected for microbiological analysis and DNA isolation. Due to low microbial biomass, only 52 of 210 samples were included in the final analysis. These samples represented two antimicrobial treatments (peroxyacetic acid, and a sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate blend) and a control, from day-15 of dark storage and day-5 of retail display. As sample age increased, so did the number of raw reads (P < 0.001) and aerobic plate counts (P < 0.001), which were correlated (r = 0.94, P = 0.017). Across all samples, lactic acid bacteria were most abundant followed by Enterobacteriaceae; several rare taxa were also identified (namely Geobacillus, Thermus, and Sporosarcina). Antimicrobial treatment altered the bacterial alpha (P < 0.001) and beta (P = 0.001) diversity, while storage day altered alpha (P = 0.001) diversity. Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance differed (P < 0.05) among treatments and was highest in control samples. In addition to confirming previously described dominant microbial differences in culture-dependent results, these data identified genera not typically associated with ground beef and allowed for study of shifts in the entire microbiome and not just a subset of indicator organisms."

C-terminal TTR fragments are often present in amyloid-laden tissues of most patients with ATTR amyloidosis, and on the basis of in vitro studies, these fragments have been proposed to play important roles in amyloid formation. Here, we found that experimentally-formed aggregates of full-length TTR are cleaved into C-terminal fragments, which were also identified in patients' amyloid-laden tissues and in SH-SY5Y neuronal and U87MG glial cells. We observed that a 5-kDa C-terminal fragment of TTR, TTR81–127, is highly amyloidogenic in vitro, even at neutral pH. This fragment formed amyloid deposits and induced apoptosis and inflammatory gene expression also in cultured cells. Using the highly amyloidogenic TTR81–127 fragment, we developed a cell-based high-throughput screening method to discover compounds that disrupt TTR amyloid fibrils. Screening a library of 1280 off-patent drugs, we identified two candidate repositioning drugs, pyrvinium pamoate and apomorphine hydrochloride.

https://openalex.org/W2948376844,"Archaeological evidence emerging over the past decade clearly illustrates that agro-pastoralists living along the foothills of major mountain chains in Central Asia (the so-called ""Inner Asian Mountain Corridor"" or IAMC) facilitated the spread of domesticated grains through their direct involvement in farming. While the environmental conditions across the northwestern slopes of the IAMC provided adequate resources for incipient farming and herding as early as the mid-3rd mill. BCE, the development of local agricultural strategies on the extremely arid and eroded foothills on the southeastern, leeward side of the mountains remain comparatively less studied. Our study tackles this problem by combining geoarchaeological analysis with conventional macrobotanical identification in the investigation of a 1st-mill. CE agro-pastoralist farming site, Mohuchahangoukou (MGK), located on the arid foothills of the Tianshan range. Our results illustrate how ancient agro-pastoralists at MGK innovated irrigation systems both to combat water shortage and, importantly, to trap sediments carried by flood-water for crop cultivation. By synthesizing currently available data, we estimate that they managed to trap about 40 cm of fine-grained sediment within a span of 200 years or even less. These stone-built field systems helped water a diverse stand of crops and create deeper soils in an otherwise deflated landscape with thin desert soils. Since we detected high levels of salt concentration (>2 dSm-1) in the lower portions of all three test trenches we analyzed, we conclude that soil salinization might have affected the long-term sustainability of this form of irrigated field management. We also infer that, besides engineering efforts, the ancient agro-pastoralists at MGK had to resolve the scheduling conflicts between irrigated farming and animal herding through labor specialization."

This study estimates entrepreneurial interest in a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 50 to 70 using partial proportional odds modeling. We estimate that more than 31 million older Americans have some interest in entrepreneurship and reveal key predictors of this interest (e.g., younger age). Importantly, the findings indicate that a more diverse group of older adults are interested in entrepreneurship than have become entrepreneurs, suggesting the need for additional research on the potential disparities between entrepreneurial interest and action in later life."

https://openalex.org/W2948603777,"Pain experience involves a complex relationship between sensory and both emotional and cognitive factors, which appear to be mediated by different neural pathways. Previous evidence has shown that whereas conscious processing of unpleasant stimuli enhances pain perception, the influence of emotions on pain under unaware conditions is much less known. The need to better characterise the relationship between pain processing and emotional factors is crucial for dealing with chronic pain conditions. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the neural correlates relating to the influence of visual masking emotional stimulation on the processing of painful stimuli in chronic pain patients suffering from fibromyalgia (FM). Twenty FM and 22 healthy control (HC) women participated in the study. The experimental masking paradigm consisted of a rapid succession of two types of stimuli, where a masked picture (neutral, negative or pain-related) was followed by a laser stimulus (painful or not painful). LEP activity was recorded at sixty scalp electrodes. An LEP-amplitude approach was used to quantify the main cerebral waves linked to pain response. ANOVAs indicated that the posterior regions of the P1 component were sensitive to experimental manipulation (p<0.05). Specifically, FM patients showed higher amplitudes to painful stimuli preceded by pain-related pictures compared with painful trials preceded by other emotional pictures. The FM group also showed greater amplitudes than those in the HC group in P2a and P2b waves. In addition to the scalp data, at the neural level the posterior cingulate cortex, lingual gyrus and insular cortex showed higher activation in the FM group than in the HC group. Our findings show an early cerebral modulation of pain (as reflected by the P1) in FM patients, suggesting that only pain-related information, even when it is unconsciously perceived, is capable to enhance exogenous (automatic) attention, increasing the neural activity involved in processing painful stimulation. Further research is needed to fully understand unconscious emotional influences on pain in fibromyalgia."
https://openalex.org/W2948630027,"Background The Sub-Saharan Africa region still remains the epicentre of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. With regards to new paediatric HIV infections, almost 90% of new HIV infections are among children (aged 0–14 years), largely through mother to child transmission. Male Partner Involvement in Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission programmes is now strongly advocated as being key in improving infant outcomes. This study describes the role of Male Partner Involvement on infant HIV infection and mortality survival in the first year among HIV-exposed infants born from HIV positive mothers. Methods This study was a two-phase, two condition (intervention or control) longitudinal study as part of a clinic-randomized Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission controlled trial. For Phase 1, female participants were recruited without their male partners. In Phase 2, both female and male participants were enrolled in the study as couples in order to encourage active Male Partner Involvement during pregnancy. Participants had two assessments prenatally (8–24 weeks and 32 weeks) and three assessments postnatally (6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months) Results About 1424 women were eligible for recruitment into the study and 18 eligible women declined to participate. All women had a partner; 54% were unmarried, 26% were cohabiting, and 20% were married. Just over half (55%) of the women had been diagnosed with HIV during the current pregnancy. Phase 1 had significantly more HIV-infected infants than Phase 2 at 12-months postpartum (aOR = 4.55 [1.38, 15.07]). Increased depressive symptoms were associated with infant HIV infection at 12-months (aOR = 1.06 [1.01, 1.10]). Phase 1 also had a significantly greater proportion of dead and HIV-infected infants than Phase 2 at 12-months (aOR = 1.98 [1.33, 2.94]). Conclusion Male partner involvement in antenatal care is critical in ensuring infant survival and HIV infection among children born to HIV-positive mothers. This study highlights the high risk of ante-and-post natal depression and underscores the need of screening for depression during pregnancy.

https://openalex.org/W2948112398,"Subsets of small-diameter dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons detect pruritogenic (itch-causing) and algogenic (pain-causing) stimuli and can be activated or sensitized by chemical mediators. Many of these chemical mediators activate receptors that are coupled to lipid hydrolysis and diacylglycerol (DAG) production. Diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKI) can phosphorylate DAG and is expressed at high levels in small-diameter mouse DRG neurons. Given the importance of these neurons in sensing pruritogenic and algogenic chemicals, we sought to determine if loss of DGKI impaired responses to itch- or pain-producing stimuli. Using male and female Dgki-knockout mice, we found that in vivo sensitivity to histamine—but not other pruritogens—was enhanced. In contrast, baseline pain sensitivity and pain sensitization following inflammatory or neuropathic injury were equivalent between wild type and Dgki-/- mice. In vitro calcium responses in DRG neurons to histamine was enhanced, while responses to algogenic ligands were unaffected by Dgki deletion. These data suggest Dgki regulates sensory neuron and behavioral responses to histamine, without affecting responses to other pruritogenic or algogenic agents."

We investigated the cost-effectiveness of this regimen. Methods A Markov-based microsimulation model with six health states is used to simulate four adjuvant therapy options for women with early-stage node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer at different age groups. The four treatment arms are 1) adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab (TH), 2) doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel and trastuzumab (ACTH), 3) docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab (TCH), and 4) no adjuvant trastuzumab (NT). Data from randomized trials were used to estimate treatment efficacy. Societal perspective was used in this cost-effectiveness analysis. Costs were measured in 2016 US dollars (US$) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was used for health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty in parameter estimation. Results We found that 40-year-old women undergoing TH treatment would have an average of 16.17 QALYs for the cost of $178,650 when lifetime horizon is used. Compared to NT, TH has incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $10,584 (ages 40–49) to $84,981 (age 80+) per additional QALYs. The sensitivity analysis showed that TH is cheaper and leads to higher QALYs compared to both ACTH and TCH for all age groups and time horizons. Conclusions TH is cost-effective for all age groups in the base case scenario and in the sensitivity analysis. In order to reduce the parameter uncertainty, clinical trials with longer follow-up times are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2948285490,"Glucocorticoids are among the most widely used drugs to treat many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Although much research has been focused on investigating glucocorticoid activity, it remains unclear how glucocorticoids regulate distinct processes in different cells. Glucocorticoids exert their effects through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which, upon glucocorticoid binding, interacts with regulatory proteins, affecting its activity and function. These protein–protein interactions are necessary for the resolution of glucocorticoid-dependent physiological and pharmacological processes. In this study, we discovered a novel protein interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and β-arrestin-1, a scaffold protein with a well-established role in G protein–coupled receptor signaling. Using co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assays in A549 cells, we observed that β-arrestin-1 and unliganded GR interact in the cytoplasm and that, following glucocorticoid binding, the protein complex is found in the nucleus. We show that siRNA-mediated β-arrestin-1 knockdown alters GR protein turnover by up-regulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino-1, which catalyzes GR ubiquitination and thereby marks the receptor for proteasomal degradation. The enhanced GR turnover observed in β-arrestin-1–deficient cells limits the duration of the glucocorticoid response on GR target genes. These results demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 is a crucial player for the stability of the glucocorticoid receptor. The GR/β-arrestin-1 interaction uncovered here may help unravel mechanisms that contribute to the cell type–specific activities of glucocorticoids."

We investigated the injury mechanism of TRI in children compared with other pediatric trauma. Methods Of 35,653 children (age 0–18 years) who visited the pediatric emergency department after traumatic injuries from January 2011 to June 2017, 372 patients with TRI (TRI group) were retrospectively identified. Among the remaining 35,281 patients with other trauma (non-TRI group), 372 were 1:1 matched to the TRI group according to sex, age, injured body part, and body weight (matched-control group). The patients’ data, injured site, and injury patterns were compared between the groups. Results The most frequently injured body part was the knee/lower leg in the TRI group and the head in the non-TRI group. The most frequent injury types were fractures in the TRI group and open wounds in the non-TRI group. In the comparison between the TRI and matched-control groups, the most common lower-extremity fractures were proximal tibial fractures with varus angulation in the TRI group and tibial shaft spiral fractures in the matched-control group. For the upper extremities, the risk of lateral condylar humeral fracture was higher in the TRI group. The TRI group presented more physeal involvements. Conclusions The risks of varus stress injury (proximal tibial fracture with varus angulation in lower extremity and lateral condylar humeral fracture in upper extremity) were higher in the TRI group than in matched-control group. Thus, varus shearing force seems to be an important injury mechanism in TRI in addition to compressive force. This varus force may increase the risk of physeal injury by generating additional shear force on the physis."
https://openalex.org/W2948625401,"IMPACT, a highly conserved protein, is an inhibitor of the eIF2α kinase GCN2. In mammals, it is preferentially expressed in neurons. Knock-down of IMPACT expression in neuronal cells increases basal GCN2 activation and eIF2α phosphorylation and decreases translation initiation. In the mouse brain, IMPACT is particularly abundant in the hypothalamus. Here we describe that the lack of IMPACT in mice affects hypothalamic functions. Impact-/- mice (Imp-KO) are viable and have no apparent major phenotypic defect. The hypothalamus in these animals shows increased levels of eIF2α phosphorylation, as expected from the described role of IMPACT in inhibiting GCN2 and from its abundance in this brain region. When fed a normal chow, animals lacking IMPACT weight slightly less than wild-type mice. When fed a high-fat diet, Imp-KO animals gain substantially less weight due to lower food intake when compared to wild-type mice. STAT3 signaling was depressed in Imp-KO animals even though leptin levels were identical to the wild-type mice. This finding supports the observation that Imp-KO mice have defective thermoregulation upon fasting. This phenotype was partially dependent on GCN2, whereas the lean phenotype was independent of GCN2. Taken together, our results indicate that IMPACT contributes to GCN2-dependent and -independent mechanisms involved in the regulation of autonomic functions in response to energy availability."

However, microcirculation blood flow is composed of different velocity components. To investigate the complexity of local speed-resolved perfusion and HRV following stimulation with different temperatures in healthy subjects, multiscale entropy (MSE) and multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE) were used to measure the complexity of local speed-resolved perfusion signals. MSE was also used to evaluate the complexity of HRV. The results indicated that thermal stimulation increased all components of local speed-resolved perfusion and that stimulation with different temperatures resulted in different changes in the complexity area index. However, the same stimulation had no effect on the MSE of HRV. Further research showed that 44°C thermal stimulation resulted in a weak correlation between the composite speed-resolved perfusion and the HRV complexity. The current study provides a new approach for studying the relationship between speed-resolved perfusion signals and cardiac function."

Additional origin-related scenarios used concentration data grouped into origin A (lower concentrations) and origin B (higher concentrations) as plausible origin information was rare. The most conservative standard scenario resulted in the highest intake estimates for aluminium and cadmium with 0.152 mg/week/kg BW and 0.363 μg/week/kg BW and covered the origin influence calculated in origin-related scenarios. Having plausible origin information would help to refine exposure assessment as it is exemplarily shown here that origin-related lower intake estimates are possible.

There is a strict quality control system evolved for newly synthesized proteins in the ER, which allows for the delivery of properly folded and modified proteins to the Golgi complex. When improperly folded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, ER functions are altered, thus prompting a cellular condition known as ER stress (4Ron D. Walter P.

Subsequently, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated, which is characterized by increased ER folding and clearance capacities as well as attenuated protein synthesis (5Hetz C. Papa F.R. The unfolded protein response and cell fate control.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 (29107536): 169-18110.1016/j.molcel.2017.06.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The UPR is mediated by three different ER stress sensors, including inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase R–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (4Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 (17565364): 519-52910.1038/nrm2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4865) Google Scholar). The UPR is initially aimed at relieving ER stress to restore the compartment's homeostasis. When the UPR fails to bring cells back to normal, such as that observed under severe or sustained ER stress, apoptosis is triggered (5Hetz C. Papa F.R. The unfolded protein response and cell fate control.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 (29107536): 169-18110.1016/j.molcel.2017.06.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). As such, UPR signaling is a double-edged signaling pathway, which is extensively involved in inflammatory and metabolic diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer (6Charonis A.S.

As the most conserved pathway for the UPR, IRE1 signaling is deeply involved in the regulation of both prosurvival and pro-death processes (7Hetz C. The unfolded protein response: controlling cell fate decisions under ER stress and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol.

IRE1 is a type I transmembrane protein with both endonuclease (RNase) and kinase catalytic activities located in the cytosol. In response to ER stress, IRE1 forms dimers or oligomers, followed by trans-autophosphorylation and activation of the RNase domain (9Credle J.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Papa F.R. Stroud R.M. Walter P. On the mechanism of sensing unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

IRE1 has three principal effects, namely the removal of a 26-nucleotide intron from the mRNA encoding XBP1, degradation of a subset of mRNAs via a process called regulated IRE1-dependent decay, and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade through the tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2)/apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) signaling axis (7Hetz C. The unfolded protein response: controlling cell fate decisions under ER stress and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (22251901): 89-10210.1038/nrm3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the XBP1 mRNA by the active IRE1 RNase, followed by a ligation process mediated by a tRNA ligase, leads to the change of XBP1 ORF, resulting in the expression of a spliced form of XBP1 referred to as XBP1s (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. XBP1 mRNA is induced by ATF6 and spliced by IRE1 in response to ER stress to produce a highly active transcription factor.Cell. 2001; 107 (11779464): 881-89110.1016/S0092-8674(01)00611-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar, 12Calfon M.

XBP1s is a transcription factor that has been implicated in the transcription of genes responsible for protein folding, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), and protein secretion and appears to be heavily involved in re-establishing ER quality control and redox homeostasis (7Hetz C. The unfolded protein response: controlling cell fate decisions under ER stress and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (22251901): 89-10210.1038/nrm3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). Aside from its RNase activity, IRE1 also activates the JNK signaling cascade through the activation of its kinase domain and the recruitment of the adaptor protein TRAF2 (13Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Coupling of stress in the ER to activation of JNK protein kinases by transmembrane protein kinase IRE1.Science. 2000; 287 (10650002): 664-66610.1126/science.287.5453.664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). The IRE1/JNK pathway plays a role in cell fate decision, because sustained and intense JNK signaling is required for the transition from the protective to pro-apoptotic function of the UPR (14Li B. Yi P. Zhang B. Xu C. Liu Q. Pi Z. Xu X. Chevet E. Liu J. Differences in endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling kinetics determine cell survival outcome through activation of MKP-1.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23 (20727407): 35-4510.1016/j.cellsig.2010.07.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This indicates that IRE1 RNase activity (XBP1 splicing) and its kinase activity (JNK signaling activation) play a differential role in the regulation of cell survival. Protein kinase D (PKD) is a serine/threonine kinase family that consists of three members, PKD1, -2, and -3, and belongs to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase superfamily (15Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. Protein kinase D signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 (15701647): 13205-1320810.1074/jbc.R500002200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In most cases, PKD is a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC), especially the novel PKC isoforms (nPKCs, such as PKCδ) (16Wang Q.J. PKD at the crossroads of DAG and PKC signaling.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27 (16678913): 317-32310.1016/j.tips.2006.04.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Specific PKCs have been reported to directly bind and phosphorylate PKD1 at two evolutionarily conserved serine residues, namely Ser738/Ser742 in the catalytic domain, leading to the activation of PKD1 (17Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. Protein kinase C phosphorylates protein kinase D activation loop Ser744 and Ser748 and releases autoinhibition by the pleckstrin homology domain.J. Biol.

PKD1 is expressed in a wide range of cells and tissues and participates in a number of intracellular signaling pathways to regulate several essential processes, such as cell survival, inflammation, and vesicle trafficking (19Rozengurt E. Protein kinase D signaling: multiple biological functions in health and disease.Physiology. 2011; 26 (21357900): 23-3310.1152/physiol.00037.2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As reported previously, PKD1 activation following H2O2 treatment promotes autophagy and cell survival (20Eisenberg-Lerner A. Kimchi A. PKD is a kinase of Vps34 that mediates ROS-induced autophagy downstream of DAPk.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19 (22095288): 788-79710.1038/cdd.2011.149Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Eisenberg-Lerner A.

Kimchi A. DAP kinase regulates JNK signaling by binding and activating protein kinase D under oxidative stress.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14 (17703233): 1908-191510.1038/sj.cdd.4402212Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Zhang W.

Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. Protein kinase D complexes with C-Jun N-terminal kinase via activation loop phosphorylation and phosphorylates the C-Jun N-terminus.Oncogene. 2002; 21 (11948398): 2154-216010.1038/sj.onc.1205290Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Considering the key role of JNK signaling in determining cell fate, we explored the possibility of PKD1 implication in UPR signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that following ER stress, PKD1 is activated in a PKC-dependent fashion, which contributes to an enhanced resistance of the cell to ER stress–induced apoptosis. Activation of the PKC/PKD1 axis, which functions as a noncanonical signaling pathway in the ER stress response, in turn modulates the canonical IRE1 signaling pathway in the UPR. PKD1 is found to be required for IRE1 stability and downstream XBP1 signaling. PKD1 activation is also responsible for regulating JNK signaling by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1) phosphorylation, which turns off the pro-apoptotic effect of JNK signaling in the UPR. This study, therefore, provides evidence for the role of PKD1 in the control of selective IRE1 prosurvival signaling. Considering its ability to modulate the kinetics of JNK signaling, PKD may also function in balancing UPR signaling, thereby determining cell fate. To this end, we first examined whether PKD1 is activated following the induction of ER stress. To achieve this, two well-characterized ER stress inducers were used, namely tunicamycin (TM; an inhibitor of protein N-linked glycosylation) and thapsigargin (TG; a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor that can disturb intracellular calcium homeostasis). In PC-3 and HepG2 cells, both ER stress inducers were able to initiate the canonical UPR signaling pathway, as characterized by TM-induced increases in IRE1 phosphorylation at Ser724 as well as increased PERK phosphorylation (as shown by its decreased electrophoretic mobility) (Fig. S1). The process by which PKD1 is activated involves the transphosphorylation of two conserved serine residues, namely Ser738 and Ser742, by nPKC, and subsequent autophosphorylation at multiple sites, including Ser910, which then confers full activation (15Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. Protein kinase D signaling.J. Biol.

To examine the kinetics of PKD1 activation, PC-3 or HepG2 cells were treated with either TM or TG for different periods of time up to 2 h, and extracts from the treated cells were subjected to Western blotting using antibodies against phospho-Ser738/Ser742-PKD1, phospho-Ser910-PKD1, and PKD1. This kinetic analysis of PKD1 activation revealed that TM induced the phosphorylation of PKD1, which peaked after 30 min of treatment and then decreased (Fig. 1, A and B). TG induced PKD1 phosphorylation in a faster and more transient manner, peaking at 10 min and then gradually returning to basal levels (Fig. 1, C and D). We also examined the phosphorylation levels of PKD1 following treatment with various concentrations of TM or TG. Compared with TG, TM induced PKD1 activation in a more concentration-dependent manner (Fig. S2, A and B). To further confirm that ER stress mediates the activation of PKD1, we also evaluated the phosphorylation status of putative PKD substrates using phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKD substrate antibodies. Treatment with TM led to the enhanced phosphorylation of PKD substrates (Fig. 1E), an effect that was dampened upon pretreatment with the PKD inhibitor kb-NB 142-70 (referred to as kb hereafter) (Fig. 1E). Taken together, our data support the notion that PKD1 is activated in response to ER stress. Accumulating evidence suggests that PKD1 is a point of convergence and integration for multiple stimuli, such as neurotransmitters, growth factors, and oxidative stress (19Rozengurt E. Protein kinase D signaling: multiple biological functions in health and disease.Physiology. 2011; 26 (21357900): 23-3310.1152/physiol.00037.2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In most cases, the activation of PKD1 is mediated by PKCs. With the aim of understanding whether ER stress–mediated PKD1 activation is PKC-dependent, we pretreated PC-3 and HepG2 cells with the pan-PKC inhibitor Gö6983 for 1 h and then treated cells with TM for 30 min. In both cell lines, pretreatment with Gö6983 potently blocked the PKD1 activation induced by TM (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). Similarly, TG-induced PKD1 phosphorylation was also abrogated by prior treatment with Gö6983 (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3B), suggesting that the ER stress-mediated PKD1 activation is mediated through PKC. PKCδ, one nPKC isoform, has been reported to play a crucial role in ER stress–induced apoptosis (26Larroque-Cardoso P. Swiader A. Ingueneau C. Nègre-Salvayre A. Elbaz M. Reyland M.E. Salvayre R. Vindis C.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121 (18285444): 804-81310.1242/jcs.024653Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and is able to directly phosphorylate PKD1 in HeLa cells subjected to oxidative stress (18Storz P. Döppler H. Toker A. Protein kinase Cδ selectively regulates protein kinase D-dependent activation of NF-κB in oxidative stress signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24 (15024053): 2614-262610.1128/MCB.24.7.2614-2626.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), which suggests the possibility that there is a PKCδ-dependent PKD1 activation in response to ER stress. To test this hypothesis, a dominant negative mutant of PKCδ (PKCδ.DN) was transfected into PC-3 and HepG2 cells, and the phosphorylation of PKD1 was examined following TM or TG treatment. Overexpression of PKCδ.DN inhibited ER stress–mediated PKD1 activation (Fig. 2, C and D and Fig. S3C). As has been reported, both conventional and novel PKCs are activated through the same signal transduction pathway mediated by phospholipase C (PLC) (28Xu X. Jin T. The novel functions of the PLC/PKC/PKD signaling axis in G protein-coupled receptor-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils.J. Immunol. Res. 2015; 2015 (26605346): 817604-81761310.1155/2015/817604Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we pretreated cells with the PLC inhibitor U73122, which also blocked the effect of ER stress on PKD1 activation (Fig. 2E). Our data, therefore, indicate that ER stress promotes PKD1 activation through a typical PLC/PKC (most likely PKCδ) pathway. PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 are regarded as canonical UPR regulators (29Hetz C. Chevet E. Oakes S.A. Proteostasis control by the unfolded protein response.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 (26123108): 829-83810.1038/ncb3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). However, additional reports have also demonstrated that other stress-signaling pathways might be induced upon ER stress, thus extending the scope of the canonical UPR (30Caruso M.-E. Jenna S.

Based on our initial observations, we next sought to investigate whether the PKC/PKD1 axis could regulate canonical UPR signaling. To this end, PKD1 siRNAs were introduced into PC-3 and HepG2 cells to down-regulate the expression of PKD1. Knockdown of PKD1 led to a decrease in TM-mediated IRE1 activation, as shown by the reduced IRE1 phosphorylation levels (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4A). In contrast, TM-mediated PERK activation was not impacted, as shown by the similar phosphorylation levels of PERK and eIF2α that were seen under all conditions (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4A). To our surprise, we observed a decrease in total IRE1 protein levels in cells transfected with PKD1 siRNAs (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4A). This observation was similar to the effect seen following exposure to TG (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4B). Consistent with these data, overexpression of WT PKD1 in PC-3 cells clearly increased the levels of IRE1 (Fig. 3C). A double phosphorylation site–defective form of PKD1, referred to as PKD.2A (S738A/S742A) has been reported to be inactive (18Storz P. Döppler H. Toker A. Protein kinase Cδ selectively regulates protein kinase D-dependent activation of NF-κB in oxidative stress signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24 (15024053): 2614-262610.1128/MCB.24.7.2614-2626.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Based on PKD.2A, we constructed PKD.3A (S738A/S742A/S910A), a new phosphorylation-defective form of PKD1. Overexpression of PKD.3A had no impact on the protein levels of IRE1 (Fig. 3C), thereby supporting the notion that PKD1 activity is involved in modulating IRE1 protein levels. We further assessed the impact of the PKD inhibitor kb on IRE1 protein expression under ER stress conditions. Consistent with other reports (34Sun S. Shi G. Sha H. Ji Y. Han X. Shu X. Ma H. Inoue T. Gao B. Kim H. Bu P. Guber R.D. Shen X. Lee A.H. Iwawaki T. et al.IRE1α is an endogenous substrate of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 (26551274): 1546-155510.1038/ncb3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), TM treatment alone led to an increase in IRE1 protein expression levels (Fig. 3D). In contrast, treatment with kb reduced the IRE1 protein levels in all cases (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, treatment with PKD1 siRNAs (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4C) or inhibitor (Fig. 3F) did not affect IRE1 mRNA expression levels, suggesting that the effects of PKD1 on IRE1 protein expression might occur at the translational or post-translational levels. To further explore this, a time-course experiment revealed that incubation of the cells with kb resulted in a gradual decrease in total IRE1 protein levels (Fig. 3G). Next, PC-3 cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, followed by kb challenge. CHX treatment alone led to a time-dependent depletion of the IRE1 protein, whereas combination treatment with both kb and CHX accelerated the loss of the IRE1 protein (Fig. 3G), thus ruling out the possibility that kb may act through the inhibition of IRE1 translation. Our data, therefore, suggest that PKD1 might be implicated in the regulation of IRE1 protein stability. As expected, combination treatment with MG132, a commonly used proteasome inhibitor, resulted in the inhibition of the kb-mediated decrease in IRE1 protein levels (Fig. 3H). Our data indicate that PKD1 plays an important role in maintaining IRE1 protein stability. Because PKD1 was implicated in the regulation of IRE1 stability, we further assessed the effect of PKD1 inactivation on the IRE1/XBP1 pathway. To address this, PC-3 cells were treated with both TM and kb, and the effect on XBP1s mRNA levels was assessed. As a result, the TM-induced increase in the levels of the XBP1s mRNA was blocked by kb treatment (Fig. 4A), accounting for the decreased mRNA levels of XBP1s target genes, including BiP, P58IPK, and ERdj4 (Fig. 4A). The total protein levels of XBP1s were examined following kb treatment in the presence of ER stress. Consistent with the changes observed in mRNA level, XBP1s protein expression levels were reduced following combination treatment with kb and TM (Fig. 4B). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKD1 also impacted the ER stress–induced expression of XBP1s protein, as was seen with the PKD1 inhibitor kb (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the overexpression of PKD1 up-regulated the TM-enhanced expression levels of XBP1s, whereas the mutant PKD.3A failed to modulate the effect of TM on XBP1s protein levels (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that the activation of PKD1 induced by ER stress regulates XBP1s and its target genes by modulating IRE1 stability and its subsequent activity. Given that PKC appears to mediate the activation of PKD1 under ER stress conditions, we also assessed the effects on IRE1 protein stability and activity in PC-3 cells treated with the PKC inhibitor Gö6983 or expressing PKCδ.DN, Gö6983 treatment alone had no effect on the expression levels of the IRE1 protein (Fig. S5, A and B). The phosphorylation levels of IRE1 and the levels of both the IRE1 and XBP1s proteins in cells treated with a combination of Gö6983 and TM or TG were no different than in TM- or TG-treated cells (Fig. S5, A and B). Moreover, the overexpression of PKCδ.DN also failed to modulate the stability and activity of IRE1 upon ER stress, as was seen in the unaltered expression levels of the IRE1 and XBP1s proteins (Fig. S5, C and D).

Using an array of biochemical assays, we observed that the pyrrolated proteins bind to the N-terminal domain of apoE and that oligomeric apoE binds these proteins better than does monomeric apoE. Employing surface plasmon resonance and confocal microscopy, we further observed that apoE deficiency leads to significant accumulation of pyrrolated serum albumin and is associated with an enhanced immune response. These results, along with the observation that apoE facilitates the binding of pyrrolated proteins to cells, suggest that apoE may contribute to the clearance of pyrrolated serum proteins.

Our findings uncover apoE as a binding target of pyrrolated proteins, providing a key link connecting covalent protein modification, lipoprotein metabolism, and innate immunity. Proteins undergo covalent modification by reactive metabolites, such as oxidized fatty acids and intermediates of glycolysis, under physiological and pathophysiological conditions (1Moellering R.E. Cravatt B.F. Functional lysine modification by an intrinsically reactive primary glycolytic metabolite.Science. 2013; 341 (23908237): 549-55310.1126/science.1238327Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The modification of proteins exerts a major impact on their chemical properties, leading to important functional and regulatory consequences. The %epsiv;-amino group of lysine, one of the three basic residues critical for protein structure and function, is a major target of covalent modification. Modification of lysine residues results in the gain of physicochemical characteristics, such as an increased negative charge caused by neutralization of the lysine residues. These host-derived, modified proteins are also categorized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: DAMPdamage-associated molecular patternapoEapolipoprotein EDMPCphospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholineLDLlow-density lipoproteinPRRpattern recognition receptorpyrKN%epsiv;-pyrrole-l-lysineHSDhonestly significant differenceESIelectrospray ionizationpyrBSApyrrolated BSAHSAhuman serum albuminHRPhorseradish peroxidase. which represent endogenous danger molecules as distinct from pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are one of the DAMPs, in which lysine residues are predominantly modified, and there are numerous claims of their presence in vivo. DAMPs can bind to pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors, and mediate inflammatory responses by triggering the release of a variety of mediators (2Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Innate immune recognition.Annu Rev Immunol. 2002; 20 (11861602): 197-21610.1146/annurev.immunol.20.083001.084359Crossref PubMed Scopus (6178) Google Scholar). DAMPs, possessing an exposed epitope, are also recognized by the soluble pattern recognition receptors, such as innate antibodies (3Miller Y.I. Choi S.H. Wiesner P. Fang L. Harkewicz R. Hartvigsen K.

Using an LC-ESI-MS/MS with a stable isotope dilution method, we have recently established the presence of proteins containing N%epsiv;-pyrrole-l-lysine (pyrK) in the human and mouse sera (12Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F. Shibata T. Hagihara Y. Maruyama S. Matsumi N. Uchida K. Lysine pyrrolation is a naturally-occurring covalent modification involved in the production of DNA mimic proteins.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24938734): 5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This finding provided direct evidence, for the first time, that the pyrrolation of proteins converting lysine residues to pyrK (Fig. 1) occurs in vivo. The pyrrole ring is an important structural motif found in a wide range of biologically active natural products and is highly susceptible to electrophilic attack and oxidation (13Walsh C.T. Garneau-Tsodikova S. Howard-Jones A.R. Biological formation of pyrroles: nature's logic and enzymatic machinery.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2006; 23 (16874387): 517-53110.1039/b605245mCrossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It also displays a variety of chemical properties, including π–π stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, that may contribute to the closer packing and higher density of pyrrole-containing molecules. Because of these chemical characteristics, the conversion of lysine residues to pyrK confers unique and interesting properties onto proteins. We have previously shown that the lysine N-pyrrolation is associated with an increase in the net negative charges of the proteins because of the modification of the lysine residues and formation of amino charge-neutralized structures (12Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F. Shibata T. Hagihara Y. Maruyama S. Matsumi N. Uchida K. Lysine pyrrolation is a naturally-occurring covalent modification involved in the production of DNA mimic proteins.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24938734): 5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, the pyrrolated proteins show a ligand specificity toward the DNA-binding molecules, such as the anti-DNA autoantibodies and DNA intercalators. The production of multispecific antibodies that recognize both pyrrolated proteins and DNA is indeed accelerated in systemic lupus erythematosus, a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the elevated production of autoantibodies. Thus, lysine N-pyrrolation is a physiologically relevant post-translational modification and could be an endogenous source of DNA mimic proteins. These findings provide a rationale for establishing a molecular mechanism and broad functional significance of the formation and regulation of the pyrrolated proteins. In this context, we speculated the presence of an innate regulatory mechanism for the pyrrolated proteins having structural properties similar to DNA and tried to identify serum pyrrole-binding proteins. To determine the presence of serum nonimmunoglobin protein(s) that can bind pyrrolated proteins, normal human serum was incubated with beads coupled to either the native BSA or pyrrolated BSA (pyrBSA), and the bound proteins were eluted and then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 2A). Several unique bands, including the protein with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (indicated by the filled arrowhead in Fig. 2A), were exclusively found in the pulldown with the pyrBSA. A similar protein band was also detected in the pyrrolated poly-l-lysine pulldowns. To identify the putative pyrrole-binding protein, the band was excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Nine peptides were found in the pulldown with pyrBSA, of which >29% could be attributed to apolipoprotein E (apoE) (Table S1). 3In this paper, the notation designating apoE refers to the sequence of apoE3, the most common isoform of human apoE. Another protein band with the molecular mass of ∼75 kDa (indicated by the open arrowhead in Fig. 2A) was also detected in the SDS-PAGE, which was identified as prothrombin (Table S2). apoE, a single polypeptide chain composed of 299 amino acid residues, exists in three major isoforms: apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, which differ at amino acid residues 112 and 158 (Fig. S1) (14Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Huang Y. Apolipoprotein E: structure determines function, from atherosclerosis to Alzheimer's disease to AIDS.J.

Because the MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the serum pyrrole-binding proteins did not allow isoform identification, we investigated whether variation in these amino acids might contribute to their differences in the binding preferences for the pyrrolated proteins. The solid-phase binding and pulldown assays showed that pyrBSA was almost equally bound to the three apoE isoforms (Figs. 2, B and C). The result was also confirmed by the surface plasmon resonance measurements (Fig. 2D and Table 1).Table 1Kinetic parameters of the interaction between pyrrolated BSA and apoE isoforms measured by surface plasmon resonancekakdKDRmaxχ2U value104 1/Ms10−5 1/s10−10 mRURU2apoE26.77 ± 0.63aThe experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means ± S.D. are shown.8.17 ± 0.7512.1 ± 0.5722.7 ± 2.600.200 ± 0.14414.0 ± 6.56apoE38.74 ± 0.6815.6 ± 4.7118.1 ± 6.1915.8 ± 2.430.245 ± 0.17816.0 ± 9.54apoE46.64 ± 0.2415.2 ± 2.6422.8 ± 3.8025.4 ± 0.860.189 ± 0.0564.67 ± 0.58a The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means ± S.D. are shown. Open table in a new tab apoE contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (amino acids ∼225–299), separated by a hinge region (15Hatters D.M. Peters-Libeu C.A. Weisgraber K.H. Apolipoprotein E structure: insights into function.Trends Biochem.

The N-terminal domain contains the LDL receptor–binding region located at residues 134–150 and Arg-172 and forms a four-helix bundle of amphipathic α-helices. The C-terminal domain contains amphipathic α-helices that are involved in the binding to lipoprotein particles. apoE also contains two heparin-binding sites: a high-affinity binding site in the N-terminal domain located at sequence 142–147 and a low-affinity binding site in the C-terminal domain located at sequence 211–218 (16Weisgraber K.H.

Heparin indeed competed in a concentration-dependent manner for the binding of apoE3 to pyrBSA (Fig. 3A), suggesting that heparin and the pyrrolated proteins might share a binding region on apoE. To further characterize the pyrrole-binding site, apoE3 was cleaved with thrombin, and the fragments were tested for their ability to bind to the biotin-labeled pyrBSA. Thrombin cleavage resulted in the generation of one major fragment of 22 kDa (E22) corresponding to residue 1–191 and three fragments of 25 (E25), 12 (E12), 10 kDa (E10) corresponding to residues 1–216, 191–299, and 216–299, respectively (Fig. 3B). Ligand blot analysis showed that the pyrrolated BSA bound to the two larger thrombolytic fragments (E25 and E22), whereas no significant binding was observed with the two smaller fragments (E12 and E10) (Fig. 3C). The further cyanogen bromide hydrolysis of the E22 fragment resulted in the loss of ligand binding (data not shown), suggesting that a relatively large region, containing the sequence 142–147 (one of the heparin-binding sites), may be required to display the binding with the pyrrolated proteins. We also questioned whether apoE could recognize the pyrrolated lysine itself as a ligand. When apoE3 was incubated with the authentic pyrK (Fig. 4A) and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis, a slight mobility shift of the protein was observed (Fig. 4B). In addition, although apoE3 showed a weak affinity for pyrK (Fig. 4C), pyrK inhibited the binding of apoE3 to the pyrrolated proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). Using a biotin-labeled N-pentylpyrrole, we determined the binding of the pyrrole probe to the apoE and the 22-kDa fragment (Figs. 4, E and F). apoE binds to the phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) to form discoidal particles containing an average of four apoE molecules per particle (18Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Cell surface receptor binding of phospholipid–protein complexes containing different ratios of receptor-active and -inactive E apoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255 (7372644): 5454-5460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding capacity of the pyrrolated proteins and pyrK to the lipid (DMPC)–bound apoE3 was lower than that to the lipid-free form (Fig. 5A). The data suggest that the pyrrolated molecules might interact mainly with the lipid-free apoE. On the other hand, the lipid-free apoE is known to form oligomers through its C-terminal domain (19Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. Self-association of human apolipoprotein E3 and E4 in the presence and absence of phospholipid.J. Biol.

It has also been suggested that the oligomerization of the apoE molecules alters their physiological functions (20Garai K. Baban B. Frieden C. Dissociation of apoE oligomers to monomers is required for high affinity binding to phospholipid vesicles.Biochemistry. 2011; 50 (21322570): 2550-255810.1021/bi1020106Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Garai K. Baban B. Frieden C. Self-association and stability of the apoE isoforms at low pH: Implications for apoE-lipid interactions.Biochemistry. 2011; 50 (21699199): 6356-636410.1021/bi2006702Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The better binding of the oligomeric apoE3 compared with that of the monomeric form was indeed shown by ligand blotting (Fig. 5B). In contrast to the binding of the pyrrolated proteins to the oligomeric forms of apoE3, the biotin-labeled N-pentylpyrrole was rather specific to the monomeric form of apoE3. Thus, the apoE3 monomer can weakly recognize pyrK and its related analogs, whereas the self-association of the apoE3 monomer to oligomers may be essential for the strong binding to the pyrrolated proteins. Despite significant binding to pyrBSA and pyrK, apoE3 had no binding potential to other pyrrole-containing small molecules, such as hemin, bilirubin, pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, and tryptophan (data not shown). The apoE deficiency is associated with a series of pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis. To gain an insight into the connection between the pyrrolation of serum proteins and apoE, we analyzed pyrK in the sera from spontaneously hyperlipidemic apoE-deficient (C.KOR/StmSlc-Apoesh) mice with a genetic background of BALB/c using LC-ESI-MS/MS. The total triglyceride and cholesterol levels were significantly elevated in the hyperlipidemia mice compared with the controls, whereas no significant differences were observed in the body weight and glucose level (data not shown). The measurement of pyrK showed that there are significant differences in the serum pyrrolated protein levels between the control and apoE-deficient mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Of interest, the pyrrolated protein levels in the hyperlipidemia males were significantly higher than in the females. We also examined the antibody titer against the pyrrolated proteins in the sera from the male control and hyperlipidemia mice and observed that there is an increased tendency for the serum IgG titers to the pyrrolated proteins in the hyperlipidemia mice as compared with the control mice (Fig. 6C). In addition, the levels of the anti-DNA titers in the hyperlipidemia mice were notably higher than those in the control mice. Thus, the high abundance of the pyrrolated proteins was found in the sera from the apoE-deficient hyperlipidemia mice compared with the controls, which was associated with the enhanced immune response to the pyrrolated proteins and DNA. These data suggest the relevance of the lysine N-pyrrolation, generating DNA mimic proteins, for the immune response in hyperlipidemia. Given the significant increase in the serum levels of the pyrrolated protein in the apoE-deficient mice, we attempted to identify the direct molecular target of the lysine N-pyrrolation in the sera of hyperlipidemia mice. To this end, we separated and fractionated the sera by anion exchange chromatography on a HitrapQ FF 5 ml column, and the level of the pyrrolated proteins in each fraction was evaluated by the pyrK measurement. In both the control and hyperlipidemia mice, pyrK was mainly detected in the fractions eluted from 10 to 25 min (Fig. 7). In addition, we selected one fraction eluted from 14 to 16 min in the apoE-deficient mice and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. S2). From three independent proteomic experiments, the protein contained in the fraction was identified as serum albumin. The same protein was identified as the pyrrolation target in the control mice. Based on the findings obtained from the animal study regarding hyperlipidemic mice, we further determined the relationship between the lysine N-pyrrolation and apoE in human hyperlipidemia (Table S3). Nineteen hyperlipidemia patients meeting these specific criteria and twenty healthy individuals were analyzed to measure the pyrK. The hyperlipidemia patients showed slightly, but significantly elevated levels of serum pyrrolated proteins compared with the normal control individuals (normal (n = 20): 6.82 ± 2.14 pmol/mg protein; hyperlipidemia (n = 19): 8.35 ± 1.66 pmol/mg protein (mean ± S.D.); p < 0.05 by Student's unpaired t test) (Fig. 8A). The apoE levels of the hyperlipidemia patients were ∼3-fold higher than those of the control subjects (Fig. 8B). These data suggest a link between apoE and protein N-pyrrolation in hyperlipidemia. apoE plays an important role in the lipoprotein metabolism through its binding to lipoprotein particles and with members of the LDL receptor family (22Mahley R.W.

To address whether apoE affects the binding of pyrrolated proteins to the cell surface, we carried out a binding assay in the presence or absence of apoE. The pyrrolated proteins, even in the absence of apoE3, exhibited significant binding to RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. 9, A and B). Notably, the binding of pyrrolated proteins to the cells was dramatically enhanced by apoE3 (Fig. S3). Both apoE2 and apoE4 also showed a similar effect (Fig. 9C and Fig. S4). Of interest, despite the significant inhibition of the binding of pyrrolated proteins by acetylated LDL, the apoE3-mediated binding of the pyrrolated proteins was barely affected by the native and modified LDLs (Fig. 9D). These data and the observation that apoE3 alone could also show a significant binding to the cells (Fig. S5) suggest that apoE may contribute to the clearance of the pyrrolated proteins. In the current study, we examined the presence of serum nonimmunoglobin proteins that are capable of binding the pyrrolated proteins and identified apoE as a hitherto unrecognized innate binding protein for the DNA mimic proteins in human serum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a previously unknown function of apoE as a binding protein for covalently modified proteins. apoE is known to play multiple roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism and shows a diverse array of biological functions by interacting with multiple molecules, including lipoproteins, lipid-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol (15Hatters D.M.

The presence of the specific binding protein for the pyrrolated proteins is thought to be an important indication that the processes leading to biologically relevant pyrrole molecules are taking place. Thus, the discovery of apoE as a pyrrole-binding protein offers new insights into the mechanisms and biological roles of lysine N-pyrrolation. The solid-phase binding assay and surface plasmon resonance measurement demonstrated that all three apoE isoforms tightly bind the pyrrolated proteins (Fig. 2). We also showed that heparin competed with the pyrrolated proteins upon binding to apoE3 and that the pyrrolated proteins bound to the 22-kDa fragment correspond to the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3). These results and the fact that lysine N-pyrrolation is associated with an increase in the net negative charges of the proteins (12Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F. Shibata T. Hagihara Y. Maruyama S. Matsumi N. Uchida K. Lysine pyrrolation is a naturally-occurring covalent modification involved in the production of DNA mimic proteins.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24938734): 5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) suggest that the binding of apoE to the pyrrolated proteins may involve an electrostatic interaction, probably the same mechasnim proposed for apoE–heparin interaction (25Yamauchi Y. Deguchi N. Takagi C. Tanaka M. Dhanasekaran P. Nakano M. Handa T. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Saito H. Role of the N- and C-terminal domains in binding of apolipoprotein E isoforms to heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate: a surface plasmon resonance study.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18507396): 6702-671010.1021/bi8003999Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, because biological significance of pyrrolated proteins remains to be completely established, it is still too early to conclude that this interaction mediates a common mechanism in apoE biology. An interesting finding in this study is that apoE3 binds some pyrrole-containing small molecules as ligands. The mobility shift and ligand-binding assays revealed that apoE3 directly interacted with pyrK and its analog, N-pentylpyrrole (Fig. 4), suggesting the presence of a recognition site for an N-alkylpyrrole moiety. The ligand blot analysis of the thrombin-digested human apoE3 also demonstrated the binding of the biotinylated pentylpyrrole to the N-terminal domain, corresponding to the binding site of the pyrrolated proteins. In addition, heparin hardly blocked the binding of N-pentylpyrrole to the immobilized apoE3. These lines of evidence allow us to postulate the presence of a unique N-alkylpyrrole-binding site in the N-terminal domain, which may also contribute to the interaction of apoE3 with the pyrrolated proteins. Another interesting observation is that the pyrrolated proteins and N-pentylpyrrole preferentially interact with the oligomeric and monomeric forms of apoE3, respectively (Fig. 5), indicating that the apoE monomer needs to associate with oligomers before binding to pyrrolated proteins. It is tempting to speculate that the oligomerization of apoE may enhance the electrostatic interaction with pyrrolated proteins to stabilize them in a manner similar to the increased binding of the apoE dimer to heparan sulfate compared with the monomeric form (25Yamauchi Y. Deguchi N. Takagi C. Tanaka M. Dhanasekaran P. Nakano M. Handa T. Phillips"

Besides its implication in the epileptic process, the behavioural consequences of the changes in its expression remain unclear. The purpose of our research is to better understand the possible role(s) of this protein through the phenotype of cKO (Grik4 Cre+/-, SV2A lox/lox) mice, male and female, which present a specific decrease of SV2A expression levels in the hippocampal glutamatergic neurons but without any epileptic seizures. In this study, we compare the cKO mice with cHZ (Grik4 Cre+/-, SV2A lox/+) and WT (Grik4 Cre+/+, SV2A lox/lox) mice through a battery of tests, used to evaluate different features: the anxiety-related features (Elevated Plus Maze), the locomotor activity (Activity Chambers), the contextual fear-related memory (Contextual Fear Conditioning), and the spatial memory (Barnes Maze). Our results showed statistically significant differences in the habituation to a new environment, an increase in the anxiety levels and spatial memory deficit in the cHZ and cKO groups, compared to the WT group. No statistically significant differences due to the genotype appeared in the spontaneous locomotor activity or the fear-linked memory. However, sexual differences were observed in this last feature. These results highlight not only an important role of the SV2A protein in the cognitive and anxiety problems typically encountered in epileptic patients, but also a possible role in the symptomatology of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as the Alzheimer’s disease."
