https://openalex.org/W2002697968,"The presence of self-reactive IgG autoantibodies in human sera is largely thought to represent a breakdown in central tolerance and is typically regarded as a harbinger of autoimmune pathology. In the present study, immune-response profiling of human serum from 166 individuals via human protein microarrays demonstrates that IgG autoantibodies are abundant in all human serum, usually numbering in the thousands. These IgG autoantibodies bind to human antigens from organs and tissues all over the body and their serum diversity is strongly influenced by age, gender, and the presence of specific diseases. We also found that serum IgG autoantibody profiles are unique to an individual and remarkably stable over time. Similar profiles exist in rat and swine, suggesting conservation of this immunological feature among mammals. The number, diversity, and apparent evolutionary conservation of autoantibody profiles suggest that IgG autoantibodies have some important, as yet unrecognized, physiological function. We propose that IgG autoantibodies have evolved as an adaptive mechanism for debris-clearance, a function consistent with their apparent utility as diagnostic indicators of disease as already established for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2090243702,"Fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation drives effective wound healing and is largely regulated by the cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Myofibroblasts express α-smooth muscle actin and are present in granulation tissue, where they are responsible for wound contraction. Our previous studies show that fibroblast differentiation in response to TGF-β1 is dependent on and mediated by the linear polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA). Both the HA receptor, CD44, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are involved in this differentiation response. The aim of this study was to understand the mechanisms linking HA-, CD44-, and EGFR-regulated TGF-β1-dependent differentiation. CD44 and EGFR co-localization within membrane-bound lipid rafts was necessary for differentiation, and this triggered downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) and Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activation. We also found that ERK phosphorylation was upstream of CaMKII phosphorylation, that ERK activation was necessary for CaMKII signaling, and that both kinases were essential for differentiation. In addition, HA synthase-2 (HAS2) siRNA attenuated both ERK and CaMKII signaling and sequestration of CD44 into lipid rafts, preventing differentiation. In summary, the data suggest that HAS2-dependent production of HA facilitates TGF-β1-dependent fibroblast differentiation through promoting CD44 interaction with EGFR held within membrane-bound lipid rafts. This induces MAPK/ERK, followed by CaMKII activation, leading to differentiation. This pathway is synergistic with the classical TGF-β1-dependent SMAD-signaling pathway and may provide a novel opportunity for intervention in wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1989476631,"Cancer cell metabolic reprogramming includes a shift in energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to less efficient glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect) and use of glutamine for increased biosynthetic needs. This necessitates greatly increased glucose and glutamine uptake, both of which enter the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). The HBP end product UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is used in enzymatic post-translational modification of many cytosolic and nuclear proteins by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Here, we observed increased HBP flux and hyper-O-GlcNAcylation in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC hyper-O-GlcNAcylation was associated with elevation of OGT and reduction of the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc (OGA). Reducing hyper-O-GlcNAcylation had no effect on non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cell growth, but inhibited PDAC cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, orthotopic tumor growth, and triggered apoptosis. PDAC is supported by oncogenic NF-κB transcriptional activity. The NF-κB p65 subunit and upstream kinases IKKα/IKKβ were O-GlcNAcylated in PDAC. Reducing hyper-O-GlcNAcylation decreased PDAC cell p65 activating phosphorylation (S536), nuclear translocation, NF-κB transcriptional activity, and target gene expression. Conversely, mimicking PDAC hyper-O-GlcNAcylation through pharmacological inhibition of OGA suppressed suspension culture-induced apoptosis and increased IKKα and p65 O-GlcNAcylation, accompanied by activation of NF-κB signaling. Finally, reducing p65 O-GlcNAcylation specifically by mutating two p65 O-GlcNAc sites (T322A and T352A) attenuated the induction of PDAC cell anchorage-independent growth. Our data indicate that hyper-O-GlcNAcylation is anti-apoptotic and contributes to NF-κB oncogenic activation in PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2007106590,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common motor neuron disease and is still incurable. The mechanisms leading to the selective motor neuron vulnerability are still not known. The interplay between motor neurons and astrocytes is crucial in the outcome of the disease. We show that mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) overexpression in primary astrocyte cultures is associated with decreased levels of proteins involved in secretory pathways. This is linked to a general reduction of total secreted proteins, except for specific enrichment in a number of proteins in the media, such as mutant SOD1 and valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97. Because there was also an increase in exosome release, we can deduce that astrocytes expressing mutant SOD1 activate unconventional secretory pathways, possibly as a protective mechanism. This may help limit the formation of intracellular aggregates and overcome mutant SOD1 toxicity. We also found that astrocyte-derived exosomes efficiently transfer mutant SOD1 to spinal neurons and induce selective motor neuron death. We conclude that the expression of mutant SOD1 has a substantial impact on astrocyte protein secretion pathways, contributing to motor neuron pathology and disease spread."
https://openalex.org/W2031841424,"α-Catenin is an actin- and vinculin-binding protein that regulates cell-cell adhesion by interacting with cadherin adhesion receptors through β-catenin, but the mechanisms by which it anchors the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton at adherens junctions remain unclear. Here we determined crystal structures of αE-catenin in the autoinhibited state and the actin-binding domain of αN-catenin. Together with the small-angle x-ray scattering analysis of full-length αN-catenin, we deduced an elongated multidomain assembly of monomeric α-catenin that structurally and functionally couples the vinculin- and actin-binding mechanisms. Cellular and biochemical studies of αE- and αN-catenins show that αE-catenin recruits vinculin to adherens junctions more effectively than αN-catenin, partly because of its higher affinity for actin filaments. We propose a molecular switch mechanism involving multistate conformational changes of α-catenin. This would be driven by actomyosin-generated tension to dynamically regulate the vinculin-assisted linkage between adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2113840765,"Glucose reacts with proteins nonenzymatically under physiological conditions. Such glycation is exacerbated in diabetic patients with high levels of blood sugar and induces various complications. Human albumin serum (HSA) is the most abundant protein in plasma and is glycated by glucose. The glycation sites on HSA remain controversial among different studies. Here, we report two protein crystal structures of HSA in complex with either glucose or fructose. These crystal structures reveal the presence of linear forms of sugar for both monosaccharides. The linear form of glucose forms a covalent bond to Lys-195 of HSA, but this is not the case for fructose. Based on these structures, we propose a mechanism for glucose ring opening involving both residues Lys-195 and Lys-199. These results provide mechanistic insights to understand the glucose ring-opening reaction and the glycation of proteins by monosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2031069848,"FFA2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that responds to short chain fatty acids and has generated interest as a therapeutic target for metabolic and inflammatory conditions. However, definition of its functions has been slowed by a dearth of selective ligands that can distinguish it from the closely related FFA3. At present, the only selective ligands described for FFA2 suffer from poor potency, altered signaling due to allosteric modes of action, or a lack of function at non-human orthologs of the receptor. To address the need for novel selective ligands, we synthesized two compounds potentially having FFA2 activity and examined the molecular basis of their function. These compounds were confirmed to be potent and selective orthosteric FFA2 agonists. A combination of ligand structure-activity relationship, pharmacological analysis, homology modeling, species ortholog comparisons, and mutagenesis studies were then employed to define the molecular basis of selectivity and function of these ligands. From this, we identified key residues within both extracellular loop 2 and the transmembrane domain regions of FFA2 critical for ligand function. One of these ligands was active with reasonable potency at rodent orthologs of FFA2 and demonstrated the role of FFA2 in inhibition of lipolysis and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in murine-derived 3T3-L1 and STC-1 cell lines, respectively. Together, these findings describe the first potent and selective FFA2 orthosteric agonists and demonstrate key aspects of ligand interaction within the binding site of FFA2 that will be invaluable in future ligand development at this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2004387611,"The stem cell in the isthmus of gastric units continually replenishes the epithelium. Atrophy of acid-secreting parietal cells (PCs) frequently occurs during infection with Helicobacter pylori, predisposing patients to cancer. Atrophy causes increased proliferation of stem cells, yet little is known about how this process is regulated. Here we show that CD44 labels a population of small, undifferentiated cells in the gastric unit isthmus where stem cells are known to reside. Loss of CD44 in vivo results in decreased proliferation of the gastric epithelium. When we induce PC atrophy by Helicobacter infection or tamoxifen treatment, this CD44+ population expands from the isthmus toward the base of the unit. CD44 blockade during PC atrophy abrogates the expansion. We find that CD44 binds STAT3, and inhibition of either CD44 or STAT3 signaling causes decreased proliferation. Atrophy-induced CD44 expansion depends on pERK, which labels isthmal cells in mice and humans. Our studies delineate an in vivo signaling pathway, ERK → CD44 → STAT3, that regulates normal and atrophy-induced gastric stem/progenitor-cell proliferation. We further show that we can intervene pharmacologically at each signaling step in vivo to modulate proliferation.Background: Gastric parietal cell atrophy causes metaplasia, reactive stem cell proliferation, and increased risk for cancer.Results: Atrophy induces proliferation of CD44-positive epithelial cells that requires ERK → CD44 → STAT3 signaling.Conclusion: CD44 is a putative gastric stem cell marker that regulates normal and metaplasia-associated proliferation.Significance: Targeted pharmacological inhibition of ERK/CD44/STAT3 signaling may help block or reverse proliferation in precancerous atrophic/metaplastic lesions.

https://openalex.org/W2171243762,"Caspase 1 activation can be induced by oxidative stress, which leads to the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL1β and IL18 in myeloid cells and a potentially damaging inflammatory response. However, little is known about the role of caspase 1 in non-immune cells, such as hepatocytes, that express and activate the inflammasome but do not produce a significant amount of IL1β/IL18. Here we demonstrate that caspase 1 activation protects against cell death after redox stress induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, we show that caspase 1 reduces mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species by increasing mitochondrial autophagy and subsequent clearance of mitochondria in hepatocytes after hypoxia/reoxygenation. Caspase 1 increases autophagic flux through up-regulating autophagy initiator beclin 1 during redox stress and is an important cell survival factor in hepatocytes. We find that during hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation, an in vivo mouse model associated with severe hepatic redox stress, caspase 1 activation is also protective against liver injury and excessive oxidative stress through the up-regulation of beclin 1. Our findings suggest an alternative role for caspase 1 activation in promoting adaptive responses to oxidative stress and, more specifically, in limiting reactive oxygen species production and damage in cells and tissues where IL1β/IL18 are not highly expressed.Background: The role of caspase 1 in non-immune cells that do not express IL1β/IL18, like hepatocytes, is largely unknown.Results: Caspase 1 activation limits excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress by up-regulating beclin1 and mitochondrial clearance in hepatocytes.Conclusion: Caspase 1 is hepatoprotective after oxidative stress.Significance: Our findings suggest a novel role for caspase 1 activation in promoting adaptive responses to oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W1994153084,"Testosterone level is low in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes. Whether this is due to negative effects of high level of insulin on the testes caused by insulin resistance has not been studied in detail. In this study, we found that insulin directly binds to insulin receptors in Leydig cell membranes and activates phospho-insulin receptor-β (phospho-IR-β), phospho-IRS1, and phospho-AKT, leading to up-regulation of DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1) gene expression in the MA-10 mouse Leydig cell line. Insulin also inhibits cAMP-induced and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1)-induced steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and steroidogenesis. In contrast, knockdown of DAX-1 reversed insulin-mediated inhibition of steroidogenesis. Whether insulin directly represses steroidogenesis through regulation of steroidogenic enzyme gene expression was assessed in insulin-injected mouse models and high fat diet-induced obesity. In insulin-injected mouse models, insulin receptor signal pathway was activated and subsequently inhibited steroidogenesis via induction of DAX-1 without significant change of luteinizing hormone or FSH levels. Likewise, the levels of steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and steroidogenesis were low, but interestingly, the level of DAX-1 was high in the testes of high fat diet-fed mice. These results represent a novel regulatory mechanism of steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. Insulin-mediated induction of DAX-1 in Leydig cells of testis may be a key regulatory step of serum sex hormone level in insulin-resistant states."
https://openalex.org/W2080840270,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important human pathogen that causes invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. We investigated the function of a major cysteine protease from S. pyogenes that affects the amount of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) and other complement factors and aimed to elucidate the mechanism involved in occurrence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from the aspect of the complement system. First, we revealed that culture supernatant of a given S. pyogenes strain and recombinant SpeB degraded the C1-INH. Then, we determined the N-terminal sequence of the C1-INH fragment degraded by recombinant SpeB. Interestingly, the region containing one of the identified cleavage sites is not present in patients with C1-INH deficiency. Scanning electron microscopy of the speB mutant incubated in human serum showed the abnormal superficial architecture and irregular oval structure. Furthermore, unlike the wild-type strain, that mutant strain showed lower survival capacity than normal as compared with heat-inactivated serum, whereas it had a significantly higher survival rate in serum without the C1-INH than in normal serum. Also, SpeB degraded multiple complement factors and the membrane attack complex. Flow cytometric analyses revealed deposition of C9, one of the components of membrane the attack complex, in greater amounts on the surface of the speB mutant, whereas lower amounts of C9 were bound to the wild-type strain surface. These results suggest that SpeB can interrupt the human complement system via degrading the C1-INH, thus enabling S. pyogenes to evade eradication in a hostile environment."
https://openalex.org/W2129552889,"Angiotensin II (AngII), a peptide hormone released by adipocytes, can be catabolized by adipose angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to form Ang(1–7). Co-expression of AngII receptors (AT1 and AT2) and Ang(1–7) receptors (Mas) in adipocytes implies the autocrine regulation of the local angiotensin system upon adipocyte functions, through yet unknown interactive mechanisms. In the present study, we reveal the adipogenic effects of Ang(1–7) through activation of Mas receptor and its subtle interplays with the antiadipogenic AngII-AT1 signaling pathways. Specifically, in human and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, Ang(1–7)-Mas signaling promotes adipogenesis via activation of PI3K/Akt and inhibition of MAPK kinase/ERK pathways, and Ang(1–7)-Mas antagonizes the antiadipogenic effect of AngII-AT1 by inhibiting the AngII-AT1-triggered MAPK kinase/ERK pathway. The autocrine regulation of the AngII/AT1-ACE2-Ang(1–7)/Mas axis upon adipogenesis has also been revealed.

https://openalex.org/W2074594979,"The hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) encodes the α subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr). Dysfunction of hERG channels due to mutations or certain medications causes long QT syndrome, which can lead to fatal ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death. Although the abundance of hERG in the plasma membrane is a key determinant of hERG functionality, the mechanisms underlying its regulation are not well understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that overexpression of the stress-responsive serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK) isoforms SGK1 and SGK3 increased the current and expression level of the membrane-localized mature proteins of hERG channels stably expressed in HEK 293 (hERG-HEK) cells. Furthermore, the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, increased the current and abundance of mature ERG proteins in both hERG-HEK cells and neonatal cardiac myocytes through the enhancement of SGK1 but not SGK3 expression. We have previously shown that mature hERG channels are degraded by ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 via enhanced channel ubiquitination. Here, we showed that SGK1 or SGK3 overexpression increased Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, which is known to inhibit Nedd4-2 activity. Nonetheless, disruption of the Nedd4-2 binding site in hERG channels did not eliminate the SGK-induced increase in hERG expression. Additional disruption of Rab11 proteins led to a complete elimination of SGK-mediated increase in hERG expression. These results show that SGK enhances the expression level of mature hERG channels by inhibiting Nedd4-2 as well as by promoting Rab11-mediated hERG recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2026039677,"NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can modulate cellular phenotype and function in part through the redox modulation of the activity of transcription factors. We demonstrate here the potential of Nox4 to drive cardiomyocyte differentiation in pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells, and we show that this involves the redox activation of c-Jun. This in turn acts to up-regulate GATA-4 expression, one of the earliest markers of cardiotypic differentiation, through a defined and highly conserved cis-acting motif within the GATA-4 promoter. These data therefore suggest a mechanism whereby ROS act in pluripotential cells in vivo to regulate the initial transcription of critical tissue-restricted determinant(s) of the cardiomyocyte phenotype, including GATA-4. The ROS-dependent activation, mediated by Nox4, of widely expressed redox-regulated transcription factors, such as c-Jun, is fundamental to this process."
https://openalex.org/W2152134291,"Cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. We investigated whether these properties affect the ability of cells to assemble a fibrillar fibronectin (FN) matrix. Analysis of matrix assembled by cells grown on FN-coated polyacrylamide gels of varying stiffnesses showed that rigid substrates stimulate FN matrix assembly and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) compared with the level of assembly and FAK signaling on softer substrates. Stimulating integrins with Mn(2+) treatment increased FN assembly on softer gels, suggesting that integrin binding is deficient on soft substrates. Guanidine hydrochloride-induced extension of the substrate-bound FN rescued assembly on soft substrates to a degree similar to that of Mn(2+) treatment and increased activation of FAK along with the initiation of assembly at FN matrix assembly sites. In contrast, increasing actin-mediated cell contractility did not rescue FN matrix assembly on soft substrates. Thus, rigidity-dependent FN matrix assembly is determined by extracellular events, namely the engagement of FN by cells and the induction of FN conformational changes. Extensibility of FN in response to substrate stiffness may serve as a mechanosensing mechanism whereby cells use pericellular FN to probe the stiffness of their environment."

https://openalex.org/W2105275447,"Endoglin is a transforming growth factor-β (TGF- β) co-receptor that participates in the activation of a signaling pathway that mediates endothelial cell proliferation and migration in angiogenic tumor vasculature. Therefore, silencing of endoglin expression is an attractive approach for antiangiogenic therapy of tumors. The aim of our study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules against endoglin in vitro and in vivo. Therapeutic potential in vitro was assessed in human and murine endothelial cells (HMEC-1, 2H11) by determining endoglin expression level, cell proliferation and tube formation. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of siRNA molecules was evaluated in TS/A mammary adenocarcinoma growing in BALB/c mice. Results of our study showed that siRNA molecules against endoglin have a good antiangiogenic therapeutic potential in vitro, as expression of endoglin mRNA and protein levels in mouse and human microvascular endothelial cells after lipofection were efficiently reduced, which resulted in the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation. In vivo, silencing of endoglin with triple electrotransfer of siRNA molecules into TS/A mammary adenocarcinoma also significantly reduced the mRNA levels, number of tumor blood vessels and the growth of tumors. The obtained results demonstrate that silencing of endoglin is a promising antiangiogenic therapy of tumors that could not be used as single treatment, but as an adjunct to the established cytotoxic treatment approaches."

Background: GadC is a glutamate/GABA antiporter in the Escherichia coli acid resistance system. Results: GadC selectively transports glutamate with no net charge and GABA with a positive charge. C-terminally truncated GadC transports Gln, but not Glu, at pH 7.0 or higher. Conclusion: This study identifies the substrate selectivity for GadC. Significance: The conclusion may be applicable to other members of the APC superfamily. Virulent enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli strain O157:H7, Shigella, Salmonella, and Yersinia (1Donnenberg M.S. Pathogenic strategies of enteric bacteria.Nature. 2000; 406: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), pose a major health threat. To survive an extremely acidic environment such as the stomach (pH 2–3), these bacteria have acquired several acid resistance systems (ARs) 3The abbreviation used is: AR, acid resistance system.

GadC is a representative member of the APC (amino acid/polyamine/organocation) superfamily of membrane transporters (11Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H.

Nucleotide sequence of the adi gene, which encodes the biodegradative acid-induced arginine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1221-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to AR2, AR3 expels protons out of the cell through Arg decarboxylation and Arg/agmatine antiport. We have recently reported the crystal structure of GadC, which exists in an inward facing conformation with its C-terminal domain (C-plug) blocking the transport path (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A biochemical study showed that, compared with AdiC, GadC exhibits a much greater stringent pH dependence for substrate transport (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). WT GadC exhibits undetectable substrate transport activity at pH 6.5 and above. Intriguingly, the C-plug-truncated variant of GadC (GadC-ΔC) has considerable transport activity at pH 6.5 (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-plug in GadC shifted its pH-dependent substrate transport toward a higher pH by 0.5 pH unit, suggesting that the C-plug of GadC may regulate the pH-dependent substrate transport. In addition, GadC can efficiently transport Gln into E. coli cells to provide acid resistance through enzymatic release of ammonium (19Lu P. Ma D. Chen Y. Guo Y. Chen G.Q. Deng H. Shi Y. l-Glutamine provides acid resistance for Escherichia coli through enzymatic release of ammonia.Cell Res. 2013; (10.1038/cr.2013.13)Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The Vmax and Km values for Gln are similar to those for Glu. Despite these mechanistic investigations, several crucial questions remain to be addressed. In particular, given the fact that Glu can exist in three distinct charge states (Fig. 1A), it is unclear whether GadC has any selectivity and, if so, which charge state(s). Other known substrates, Gln and GABA, also have more than one possible charge states (Fig. 1, B and C). Elucidation of substrate selectivity is at the center of the pH-dependent transport mechanism for GadC. GadC functions at acidic pH and becomes inactive at neutral pH and above (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Apparently, different pH values affect distribution of the various charge states for each substrate. With pKa values of 9.1–10.4, >99.9% of the α-amino groups of Glu/Gln and the γ-amino groups of GABA are protonated at pH 5.5. Thus, Glu may carry one negative charge (Glu−), no net charge (Glu0), or one positive charge (Glu+) (Fig. 1A). Similarly, GABA exists in two states: with no net charge (GABA0) and with one positive charge (GABA+) (Fig. 1B). Gln also exists in two potential charged states: with no net charge (Gln0) and with one positive charge (Gln+) (Fig. 1C). Among these various states, Gln+ and Glu+ require protonation of their α-carboxyl groups (pKa ∼ 2.17–2.19) and thus are unlikely to populate within living cells, where the pH value cannot drop below 3.5 (20Richard H. Foster J.W. Escherichia coli glutamate- and arginine-dependent acid resistance systems increase internal pH and reverse transmembrane potential.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6032-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Previous studies show that the exchange of Glu and GABA is strongly influenced by membrane potential in the proteoliposome-based assay; GABA efflux and Glu influx are markedly increased at a positive potential inside the proteoliposomes and decreased at negative potentials inside the proteoliposomes (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that GABA carries additional positive charge(s) compared with Glu (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, there are three theoretical possibilities for Glu/GABA exchange: Glu−/GABA0, Glu−/GABA+, and Glu0/GABA+. Because Gln can be transported by GadC with high efficiency and structurally mimics the γ-carboxyl group protonated form of Glu (Glu0 or Glu+), we hypothesized that Glu0 is the primary substrate for GadC. In this study, we demonstrate that GadC transports Glu0, Gln0, and GABA+ in a proteoliposome-based counterflow assay. These results indicate that the protonation states of a given substrate are crucial for transport and that side chain deprotonation of Glu and GABA at neutral pH impedes Glu/GABA exchange. The experimental procedures were similar to those reported previously (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A hexahistidine tag was proteolytically removed on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) after washing with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (Anatrace). GadC was eluted and further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 10/30, GE Healthcare). The peak fractions were collected. GadC-ΔC was prepared in the same way as the WT protein. Liposomes and proteoliposomes were prepared using E. coli polar lipid (Avanti) as described previously (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Liposomes and proteoliposomes were loaded with 5 mm substrate (Glu, GABA, or Gln), 150 mm KCl, and 25 mm various buffer systems: MES buffer or phosphate buffer was used at pH 5.5, MES buffer was used at pH 6.0 and 6.5, HEPES buffer was used at pH 7.0 and 7.5, and Tris buffer was used at pH 8.0 and 8.5. All transport assays were carried out as described previously (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of proteoliposomes (2 μl) to 100 μl of external buffer containing various buffer systems (25 mm), 150 mm KCl, and 50 μm unlabeled Glu plus 0.2 μm [3H]Glu (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 50 μm unlabeled Gln plus 0.2 μm [3H]Gln (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The uptake of 3H-labeled substrate was stopped at the indicated time points. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Liposomes were loaded with 5 mm GABA or Glu and either 120 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) or potassium phosphate (pH 5.5). Reactions were initiated by the addition of proteoliposomes (2 μl) to 100 μl of external buffer containing 120 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.5) or sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 50 μm unlabeled Gln, and 0.2 μm [3H]Gln, with or without 1 μg/ml valinomycin. For determination of the Vmax and Km values, the same substrates were used on both sides of proteoliposomes (Glu/Glu or Gln/Gln). The chosen time points were within the linear range of substrate accumulation: for Glu, a 1-min time point was chosen at pH 5.5, and 10-min time point was chosen at pH 6.0 and 6.5; and for Gln, 1-min time point was chosen at pH 5.5 and 6.0, and 10-min time point was chosen at pH 6.5 and 7.0. Proteoliposome preparation and the substrate transport procedure were described above. If our hypothesis that GadC transports Glu0 is true, then electrostatic potential across the membranes of the proteoliposome should have little effect on GadC-mediated exchange of Gln and Glu. To examine this scenario, we purified recombinant WT GadC to homogeneity and investigated the influence of membrane potential on the exchange of Gln and Glu at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2A). In this assay, the proteoliposomes were loaded with 5 mm Glu, and the external buffer contained 50 μm Gln and [3H]Gln. The inclusion of 120 mm Na+ within the proteoliposomes and 120 mm K+ in the external buffer allowed influx of K+ ions into the proteoliposomes in the presence of valinomycin, generating a positive inside potential. This potential had little effect on substrate transport by GadC, with temporal accumulation of Gln in the presence of the positive inside potential (Fig. 2A, black line) comparable to that in its absence (blue line). Similarly, inclusion of 120 mm K+ inside the proteoliposomes and 120 mm Na+ in the external buffer allowed efflux of K+ ions into the external buffer in the presence of valinomycin, generating a negative inside potential. This potential had little effect on substrate transport by GadC (Fig. 2A, compare green and red lines). The membrane potential-independent exchange of Gln and Glu strongly suggests that both substrate molecules may carry the same amount of net charge. Gln can exist as either Gln0 or Gln+ over the pH range 0–7, whereas our prior analysis showed that GadC can transport only Glu− or Glu0. Together, these results unambiguously demonstrate that Glu0, but not Glu−, is the substrate for GadC. The results from the above analysis, together with our previous data (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicate that only GABA+ can be transported by GadC. We sought to verify this prediction by examining the effect of membrane potential on GadC-mediated exchange of Gln and GABA in a proteoliposome-based assay at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2B). Under this condition, Gln exists mainly as Gln0, and GABA exists as GABA0 or GABA+. In this assay, the proteoliposomes were loaded with 5 mm GABA, and the external buffer contained 50 μm Gln and [3H]Gln. In complete agreement with our prediction, a positive potential inside the proteoliposomes significantly enhanced the influx of Gln and the efflux of GABA (Fig. 2B, compare black and blue lines). The initial exchange rate of Gln and GABA in the presence of the positive inside potential was ∼4-fold faster than that in its absence. The total accumulation of Gln at the 40-min time point in the presence of the positive inside potential (Fig. 2B, black line) was ∼2.5-fold of that in its absence (blue line). Conversely, the negative potential inside the proteoliposome had a negative impact on the influx of Gln and the efflux of GABA (Fig. 2B, compare green and red lines). Both the initial exchange rate of Gln and GABA and the total accumulation of Gln at the 40-min time point in the presence of the negative inside potential (Fig. 2B, green line) were less than half of those in its absence (red line). These results reveal that GABA carries additional positive charge compared with Gln0 and confirm our prediction that GABA+ is the transport substrate for GadC. WT GadC exhibits undetectable transport activity at pH 6.5 and above (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Removal of the C-plug in GadC (GadC-ΔC) allowed restoration of transport at pH 6.5 and shifted the pH-dependent substrate transport by 0.5 pH unit toward a higher pH. However, at pH 7.0 and above, the transport activity of GadC-ΔC for Glu is completely abolished (18Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Given the observation that GadC transports only Glu0, we hypothesized that the abolished transport activity is due at least in part to the deprotonation of Glu at neutral pH. If this hypothesis is true, then transport of Gln should occur at pH 7.0 and above, under which condition Gln exists predominantly as Gln0. To examine this scenario, we purified GadC-ΔC to homogeneity and investigated the transport of Gln by GadC-ΔC at six different pH values (pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0) using the proteoliposome-based assay. pH-dependent transport of Glu was performed as a control experiment (Fig. 3A). The accumulation of Glu within 10 min at pH 5.5 was robust, and the level of Glu transport sharply decreased with increasing pH values. At pH 7.0 and above, there was no detectable accumulation of Glu (Fig. 3A). In sharp contrast, Gln transport by GadC-ΔC was quite efficient at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3B, red line) and still detectable at pH 7.5 and 8.0 (Fig. 3B, purple and orange lines). Transport of Gln by GadC-ΔC also decreased with increasing pH values, but the rate of decrease was markedly slower than that for transport of Glu. The accumulation of Gln at the 10-min time point at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 was ∼96, 71, 54, 16, and 4% of that at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3B). We compared the accumulation of Glu and Gln over 10 min at different pH values (Fig. 4A). The data show that pH-dependent accumulation of Gln by GadC-ΔC was shifted ∼1 unit toward a higher pH compared with that of Glu (Fig. 4A). To further characterize the pH-dependent substrate transport, we compared the activities of GadC-ΔC for Glu and Gln transport under identical sets of experimental conditions. All transport rate versus substrate concentration curves were fitted using the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the resulting maximal transport activities (Vmax) for Glu and Gln at different pH values were determined (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 1). The Vmax values for Glu at pH 6.0 and 6.5 were ∼21 and 4% of that at pH 5.5, and the transport activity for Glu at pH 7.0 was undetectable. In contrast, the Vmax values for Gln at pH 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 were ∼114, 18, and 14% of that at pH 5.5, respectively. These results are consistent with the substrate accumulation results shown in Fig. 4A. Thus, the pH-dependent transport of Gln by GadC-ΔC is shifted toward a higher pH by 1 unit compared with that of Glu. Our results demonstrate that GadC exchanges Glu0 with GABA+, or Gln0 with Glu0. Our experimental findings also indicate that side chain deprotonated states of Glu and GABA (Glu− and GABA0) are selected against by GadC. On the basis of these results, we propose a working model to illustrate the mechanism of the pH-dependent transport by GadC in E. coli (Fig. 5). In a neutral pH environment that is favorable to survival (Fig. 5A), the cytoplasm of E. coli is likely maintained at neutral pH. Most of the substrates exist in their deprotonated states (Glu− and GABA0), which are not substrates for GadC. In addition, the C-plug of GadC blocks the transport path. Under these conditions, no substrates exchange occurs. When E. coli is exposed to an extremely acidic environment (such as pH 2), the cytoplasm also becomes considerably acidic (such as pH 4.2 (20Richard H. Foster J.W. Escherichia coli glutamate- and arginine-dependent acid resistance systems increase internal pH and reverse transmembrane potential.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6032-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 5B). At this pH, the C-plug of GadC should be dislodged, and the transport path is open. In the stomach (pH ∼2), ∼99% of the Glu side chain (pKa ∼ 4.25) is protonated, and roughly half of the extracellular Glu exists as Glu0. Glu0 will be transported into the cell by GadC. The imported Glu is decarboxylated to generate GABA (pKa ∼ 4.23, α-carboxyl group). Almost equal amounts of GABA0 and GABA+ are present in the cytoplasm, but only GABA+ can be exported by GadC. The pH-dependent transport of GadC ensures that substrate exchange can be efficiently activated only in an acidic environment, preventing an unnecessary waste of energy. Intriguingly, Gln transport by GadC-ΔC at pH 8.0 was much less active than at pH 5.5 (Fig. 4). This result indicates that pH-dependent substrate protonation does not fully explain the pH-dependent substrate transport by GadC-ΔC and further suggests the presence of a pH sensor in the GadC antiporter itself. This putative pH sensor likely forces selective closure of the transport path of GadC at neutral and basic pH. The exact nature of this pH-sensing mechanism awaits further biochemical and structural investigations. It should be noted that, although our in vitro transport assays were performed at pH 5.5, the conclusions should be applicable to the physiological conditions. Our conclusions may also have significant implications for GadC homologs such as AdiC and CadB and possibly other members of the APC superfamily. Addendum—While this manuscript was in the final stage of preparation, Tsai et al. (21Tsai M.F. McCarthy P. Miller C.

We note that the conclusions in that report are generally consistent with ours, although the detailed experimental approaches are different. Tsai et al. identified Glu− and Glu0 as potential substrates for GadC, whereas our analysis suggests that only Glu0 may serve as the substrate. Download .pdf (.1 MB) Help with pdf files"

To investigate the molecular mechanism of diabetic dementia, we induced type 2 diabetes in rats and examined potential changes in their cognitive functions and the neural morphology of the brains. We found that the diabetic rats with an impairment of spatial learning and memory showed the occurrence of RTN3-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites in the cortex. Biochemical examinations revealed the increase of a high molecular weight form of RTN3 (HW-RTN3) in diabetic brains. The corresponding decrease of monomeric RTN3 was correlated with the reduction of its inhibitory effects on the activity of β-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme for generation of β-amyloid peptides. The results from immunoprecipitation combined with protein carbonyl detection showed that carbonylated RTN3 was significantly higher in cortical tissues of diabetic rats compared with control rats, indicating that diabetes-induced oxidative stress led to RTN3 oxidative damage. In neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, high glucose and/or H2O2 treatment significantly increased the amounts of carbonylated proteins and HW-RTN3, whereas monomeric RTN3 was reduced.

Drugs currently available for treating dementia and AD have only minimal effects and do not impede disease progression significantly (7O'Brien J.T. Burns A. Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs. A revised (second) consensus statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.J. Psychopharmacol. 2011; 25: 997-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Clinically, the symptoms of dementia gradually develop over many years or even decades. Therefore, the prevention of AD development is an alternative strategy for reducing the incidence of the disease. To delay the onset of symptoms, potentially modifiable risk factors for AD and dementia must be identified. A National Institutes of Health review reported that diabetes is one of the high risk factors for dementia and AD (8Daviglus M.L. Bell C.C. Berrettini W. Bowen P.E. Connolly Jr., E.S. Cox N.J.

Preventing alzheimer disease and cognitive decline.Ann. Intern. Med. 2010; 153: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to increase worldwide (9Shaw J.E. Sicree R.A. Zimmet P.Z. Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030.Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2010; 87: 4-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar), and 90–95% of the diabetic cases are non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes). Epidemiological studies clearly demonstrate an association between diabetes and dementia (10Xu W.L. von Strauss E. Qiu C.X. Winblad B. Fratiglioni L.

Laedtke T. Parisi J.E. O'Brien P. Petersen R.C. Butler P.C. Increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Alzheimer disease.Diabetes. 2004; 53: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar); memory loss or cognitive decline in diabetic patients may be caused by vascular permeability and protein metabolism dysfunctions (13Murray I.V.

Using different animal models, several groups have demonstrated that the activity of β-secretase (BACE1) and the Aβ content are increased in DM genetic mouse brains (14Li Z.G. Zhang W. Sima A.A. Alzheimer-like changes in rat models of spontaneous diabetes.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and type 2 diabetes rats (15Zhang T. Pan B.S. Zhao B. Zhang L.M.

In addition, hyperphosphorylated Tau is increased in type 2 diabetes rat brains and negatively correlates with the changes in phosphorylated synaptophysin, a synaptic protein (16Zhang T. Pan B.S.

Although other studies have suggested that increased Aβ generation in post-stroke brains is likely associated with increased stability of BACE1 via activation of caspase-3 (17Xiong M. Zhang T. Zhang L.M. Lu S.D. Huang Y.L. Sun F.Y. Caspase inhibition attenuates accumulation of β-amyloid by reducing β-secretase production and activity in rat brains after stroke.Neurobiol.

Reticulons (RTNs), a family of membrane-bound proteins consisting of four members (20Oertle T. Schwab M.E.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Elevated expression of RTNs in mouse and human brains appears to cause dysfunction in axonal generation and synaptic transmission (24Yang Y.S. Strittmatter S.M. The reticulons. A family of proteins with diverse functions.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: 234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Parodi J. Sepúlveda F.J. Roa J. Opazo C. Inestrosa N.C.

Chem. 2010; 285: 2506-2514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that all four RTNs negatively modulate BACE1 activity (26Yan R. Shi Q. Hu X. Zhou X. Reticulon proteins. Emerging players in neurodegenerative diseases.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Tang B.L. Liou Y.C. Novel modulators of amyloid-β precursor protein processing.J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RTN3, which is mainly expressed by neurons in the brain and co-localizes with BACE1 in neurons, is a potent BACE1 inhibitor (28Murayama K.S. Kametani F. Saito S. Kume H. Akiyama H. Araki W. Reticulons RTN3 and RTN4-B/C interact with BACE1 and inhibit its ability to produce amyloid β-protein.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Functional studies indicate that a normal increase in RTN expression substantially reduces Aβ and overexpression of RTN3 in transgenic mouse brain induces the formation of RTN3 aggregates in neurites, causing neuritic dystrophy and impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as synaptic plasticity (29Hu X. Shi Q. Zhou X. He W. Yi H. Yin X. Gearing M. Levey A. Yan R. Transgenic mice overexpressing reticulon 3 develop neuritic abnormalities.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2755-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrate that preformed RTN3 aggregates reduce dendritic spine density and synaptic function in transgenic mouse brains (30Shi Q. Prior M. He W. Tang X. Hu X. Yan R. Reduced amyloid deposition in mice overexpressing RTN3 is adversely affected by preformed dystrophic neurites.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9163-9173Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, RTNs are emerging as critical factors in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. It has been well demonstrated that the advanced stages of diabetes usually result in sensory and autonomic neuropathy in the peripheral nervous system and white matter lesions as well as cortical and subcortical atrophy in the central nervous system, which has been indicated by magnetic resonance image (31Nelson P.T. Smith C.D. Abner E.A. Schmitt F.A. Scheff S.W. Davis G.J. Keller J.N. Jicha G.A. Davis D. Wang-Xia W. Hartman A. Katz D.G. Markesbery W.R. Human cerebral neuropathology of type 2 diabetes mellitus.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 454-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because RTN3-mediated neuritic dystrophy is linked to Alzheimer cognitive dysfunction, we therefore asked whether RTN3-mediated neuritic dystrophy occurred in the frontal parietal cortex of diabetic rats and whether its occurrence would contribute to diabetic dementia. To address these questions, we used an induced type 2 diabetes rat model to observe changes in cognitive function and neuronal morphology in diabetic brains. The results demonstrated that monomeric RTN3 and its interaction with BACE1 were decreased in diabetic rats and that these changes were followed by an increase in Aβ formation in the cortex. Furthermore, RTN3 aggregates densely accumulated in neurites immunopositive for RTN3 oligomers but not the neuritic marker SMI32. Further studies indicated that oxidative stress might cause the formation of RTN3 oligomers and promote neuritic dystrophy in diabetic brains. Behavioral tests further revealed cognitive deficits in diabetic rats. Collectively, these results reveal a novel molecular mechanism of diabetic dementia and suggest a new therapeutic strategy for preventing or reducing the development of dementia in type 2 diabetes patients. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–220 g) from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center (Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) were used. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Rats were divided into control and diabetic (DM) groups and fed with commercially available normal pellet diet (NPD) (10% calories as fat) or in-house prepared high fat diet (60% calories as fat, and the diet composition included 425 g·kg−1 powdered NPD, 310 g·kg−1 lard, 250 g·kg−1 casein, 10 g·kg−1 cholesterol, dl-methionine, 1 g·kg−1 yeast powder, 1 g·kg−1 sodium chloride) for a period of 2 months based on previously published protocols (15Zhang T. Pan B.S. Zhao B. Zhang L.M. Huang Y.L. Sun F.Y. Exacerbation of poststroke dementia by type 2 diabetes is associated with synergistic increases of β-secretase activation and β-amyloid generation in rat brains.Neuroscience. 2009; 161: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Zhang T.

The high fat diet rats were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (25 mg·kg−1, Alexis, Exeter, UK) and then fed with their original diet for another month. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels were measured with a Hitachi Model 7600 Series Automatic Analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies Corp.). To analyze the insulin sensitivity of rats, a simple intravenous insulin glucose tolerant test was performed as previously described (32Zhang F. Ye C. Li G. Ding W. Zhou W. Zhu H. Chen G. Luo T. Guang M. Liu Y. Zhang D. Zheng S. Yang J. Gu Y. Xie X. Luo M. The rat model of type 2 diabetic mellitus and its glycometabolism characters.Exp. Anim. 2003; 52: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, after rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection 10% chloral hydrate (360 mg·kg−1), two femoral blood vessels were exposed by incision through the skin in the inguinal area. These vessels were cannulated with plastic fine cannulae, and then the intravenous insulin glucose tolerant test was performed. The rats were subsequently injected with glucose (0.7 g·kg−1) and insulin (0.175 units·kg−1) into the femoral vein. Blood samples were then withdrawn from the femoral artery at ∼0 (before glucose), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, and 30 min after insulin injection for the glucose estimation. The equivalent volume of sterile saline (0.9%) was injected into femoral vein after each sampling to prevent the changes in central compartmental blood volume. Insulin sensitivity was determined by the glucose disappearance rate within 10 min, evident from the average slope K in the curve fitted by log-linear regression over this period. Rats with blood glucose higher than 18 mmol/liter were defined as diabetic animals. Rats were subjected to the Morris water maze test to analyze cognitive function as previously reported (15Zhang T. Pan B.S. Zhao B. Zhang L.M. Huang Y.L. Sun F.Y. Exacerbation of poststroke dementia by type 2 diabetes is associated with synergistic increases of β-secretase activation and β-amyloid generation in rat brains.Neuroscience. 2009; 161: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Morris R. Developments of a water-maze procedure for studying spatial learning in the rat.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1984; 11: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5766) Google Scholar). The Morris water maze test consisted of a non-visible platform trial, a probe trial, and a visible platform trial. Rats received the non-visible platform trial twice per day (every morning and afternoon) for the first 5 days, a probe trial on the 6th day, and a visible platform trial on the 7th day. The swimming path and the escape latency (time to reach the platform) were recorded in real time by video camera assisted with Microcomputer Running Maze Software (Shanghai Jiliang Software Technology Co., Ltd.). The mean escape latency, the percentage of time spent in the right quadrant, and the velocity (mm/s) were calculated and used for statistical analysis. Animals were deeply anesthetized and quickly subjected to transcardial perfusion with freshly prepared 0.9% saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffer solution (0.1 m, pH 7.4, PBS). Then coronal sections at a thickness of 30 μm were cut on a freezing microtome (Jung Histocut, Model 820-II, Leica, Germany) at the bregma level from −2.30 to −3.30 mm. Brain sections were probed with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-BACE1 antibody B690, 1:1000 (Calbiochem) or mouse monoclonal anti-Aβx-42 antibody, 1:200 (Millipore) and corresponding biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200, Vector Laboratories) followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase (1:200, Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). Immunoreactivity was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as the chromogen. Negative controls received the same treatment, except that primary antibodies were omitted, and showed no specific staining. For double staining of RTN3 with NeuN, SMI32, or oligomers, free-floating sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-RTN3 antibody (R458, 1:1000) and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (1:1000, Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-SMI32 antibody (1:1000, Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-AT8 antibody (1:60, Innogenetics), or rabbit monoclonal antibody against oligomers (Invitrogen) and then incubated with anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine (NeuN, SMI32, AT-8) or anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine (oligomer) (1:50, Roche Diagnostics). Fluorescent signals were detected using a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP5, Leica). The immunostaining were carried out based on a previous report (34Liu H.M. Yang S.Z. Sun F.Y. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium time-dependently alters expressions of oxoguanine glycosylase 1 and xeroderma pigmentosum group F protein in PC12 cells.Neurosci. Bull. 2010; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase in 10 mm Tris buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) for 60 min at 37 °C and with 2 n HCl for 10 min at room temperature and then neutralized with 50 mm Tris buffer for 5 min at room temperature. The sections were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) for 60 min at 37 °C and incubated with mouse anti-8-oxodG monoclone antibody (1:1000, R&D system, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (1:200) for 60 min and with avidin-biotin-peroxidase (1:200, Vectastain Elite ABC kit). Immunoreactivity was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. Negative controls received the same treatment, except that primary antibodies were omitted and showed no specific staining. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) from cortex was used for RT-PCR. The primers were as follows: β-actin (accession number NM031144), forward (gtcttcccctccatcgtggg) and reverse (tggctggggtgttgaaggtc), resulting in a 306-bp product; RTN3 (accession number NM080909.2), forward (ctggcagctttcagtgtt) and reverse (aatgggaagactaagagcg), resulting in a 204-bp product. Reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl with Taq polymerase (5 units/μl, Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) for 30 cycles. Each PCR product (20 μl) was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized using an ultraviolet transilluminator (Image Master VDS, Bio-Rad) and photographed. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the high sensitivity Aβ40 (KHB3481)- and Aβ42 (KHB3441)-specific ELISA kits (Invitrogen). Briefly, the samples of rat wet brain were weighed and dissolved in cold 50 mm Tris/5 m guanidine buffer (pH 8.0) to achieve the final concentration, 1 mg/μl. Then tissues were ground thoroughly, and homogenates were mixed at room temperature for 4 h. Homogenates were diluted 1:20 with cold reaction buffer containing 0.2 g·liter−1 KCl, 0.2 g·liter−1KH2PO4, 8.0 g·liter−1 NaCl, 1.15 g·liter−1 Na2HPO4, 5% BSA, 0.03% Tween 20, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablet, Roche Diagnostics) then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by a BCA kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Then Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were determined by comparison with the respective standard curves following the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts of protein from cerebral cortex tissue extracts or cell lysates were electrophoresed on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE gels and then transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes. Anti-RTN3 antibody (1:2000), anti-BACE1 antibody (1:1000), and anti-APP-C-terminal antibody (1:2000, Sigma) were used to detect the levels of these specific proteins. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgGs (1:3000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as secondary antibodies, and Western blotting luminescent reagent was used to visualize peroxidase activity. Normalization was carried out by stripping the blots and reprobing with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the β-isoform of actin (1:10,000, Sigma). Optical densities of immunostained bands were analyzed with an image processing and analysis system (Image J 1.37 software, National Institutes of Health). Tissue extracts (200 μg of protein) were first incubated with 1 μl of anti-BACE1 antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-oligomer antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Inc.) or anti-RTN3 antibody in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture for 12 h at 4 °C and then with protein-A beads for 2 h. The reactions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to obtain the immunoprecipitates, which were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-RTN3 (1:2000) or anti-BACE1 (1:1000) antibodies as described above. The human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was cultured in 6-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Once cells reached 80–90% confluence, the cultures were incubated in medium containing 300 μm H2O2, 500 μm H2O2, 25 mm glucose, 300 μm H2O2 + 25 mm glucose, or 500 μm H2O2 + 25 mm glucose for 1 h, then harvested for RTN3 and protein carbonyl detection. Cells were cultured with medium containing 0.5% DMSO (vehicle) as a control. Protein carbonyl adduct formation was used to identify oxidized proteins as previously described (35Lortz S. Tiedge M. Nachtwey T. Karlsen A.E. Nerup J. Lenzen S. Protection of insulin-producing RINm5F cells against cytokine-mediated toxicity through overexpression of antioxidant enzymes.Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical lysates (20 μg of protein) or cell lysates (40 μg of protein) were first reacted with 10 mmol of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 n HCl for 20 min to enable adduct formation by the dinitrophenyl (DNP) group and then the reaction was quenched by using 1 m Tris solution. The samples containing protein carbonyls/DNP-modified proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with goat anti-DNP antibody (1:2000, Abcam). For analyzing carbonylated RTN3, total proteins from the carbonylated samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-DNP, purified with protein-A beads, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-RTN3 antibody. Optical densities of immunoblot and PCR bands were determined using Image J software. Densitometric quantification of HW-RTN3/RTN3 and RTN3mRNA was normalized to β-actin. All cells with positive staining in immunochemistry detection were counted in the fields of view and were repeated in four sections for each group. The significance of difference between control and DM groups was analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests, and multiple groups statistical differences in SH-SY5Y experiment were determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Least Significant Difference tests. All values are presented as the means ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To verify the establishment of the diabetic model, we measured body weight, total levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose in the blood plasma and detected insulin sensitivity by glucose tolerant test. Our results indicated that the rats in the DM group exhibited a significant increase in body weight as well as significantly higher levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose compared with the control group, whereas brain weight did not change (Fig. 1, A–C). Furthermore, glucose disappearance rates (k value) were significantly reduced in the diabetic rats compared with that in the controls (Fig. 1D), confirming that the diabetic rats were insulin-resistant. To test whether the above changes would affect cognitive function in rats, we"

Here we report that the DNA damage signaling pathway inhibits Plk1 activity through Bora. Following UV irradiation, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated- and Rad3-related protein phosphorylates Bora at Thr-501. The phosphorylated Thr-501 is subsequently recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF-β-TRCP, which targets Bora for degradation. The degradation of Bora compromises Plk1 activation and contributes to DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. These findings shed new light on Plk1 regulation by the DNA damage response pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2037657568,"The transfer of Ca(2+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane is an important physiological process linked to the regulation of metabolism, signal transduction, and cell death. While the definite molecular composition of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake sites remains unknown, several proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane, that are likely to accomplish mitochondrial Ca(2+) fluxes, have been described: the novel uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, the leucine zipper-EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1 and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. It is unclear whether these proteins contribute to one unique mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake pathway or establish distinct routes for mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration. In this study, we show that a modulation of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum by inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase modifies cytosolic Ca(2+) signals and consequently switches mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake from an uncoupling protein 3- and mitochondrial calcium uniporter-dependent, but leucine zipper-EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1-independent to a leucine zipper-EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1- and mitochondrial calcium uniporter-mediated, but uncoupling protein 3-independent pathway. Thus, the activity of sarco/endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase is significant for the mode of mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration and determines which mitochondrial proteins might actually accomplish the transfer of Ca(2+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Moreover, our findings herein support the existence of distinct mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake routes that might be essential to ensure an efficient ion transfer into mitochondria despite heterogeneous cytosolic Ca(2+) rises."

However, the mechanisms regulating the KDM4 protein stability remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the molecular chaperon Hsp90 interacts with and stabilizes KDM4B protein. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 with geldanamycin resulted in ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of KDM4B, but not of KDM4C, suggesting that the turnover of these demethylases is regulated by distinct mechanisms. This degradation was accompanied by increased methylation of H3K9. We further show that KDM4B is ubiquitinated on lysines 337 and 562; simultaneous substitution of these residues to arginine suppressed the geldanamycin-induced degradation of KDM4B, suggesting that the ubiquitination of Lys-337 and Lys-562 targets KDM4B for proteasomal degradation upon Hsp90 inhibition. These findings constitute a novel pathway by which Hsp90 activity alters the histone code via regulation of KDM4B stability. This pathway may prove a druggable target for the treatment of tumors driven by enhanced KDM4B activity."
https://openalex.org/W1997632499,"Fer is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is activated in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation. In the present report, we show that Fer associates with the activated PDGF β-receptor (PDGFRβ) through multiple autophosphorylation sites, i.e. Tyr-579, Tyr-581, Tyr-740, and Tyr-1021. Using low molecular weight inhibitors, we found that PDGF-BB-induced Fer activation is dependent on PDGFRβ kinase activity, but not on the enzymatic activity of Src or Jak kinases. In cells in which Fer was down-regulated using siRNA, PDGF-BB was unable to induce phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas phosphorylations of STAT5, ERK1/2, and Akt were unaffected. PDGF-BB-induced activation of STAT3 occurred also in cells expressing kinase-dead Fer, suggesting a kinase-independent adaptor role of Fer.

The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family consists of five biologically active dimers of four polypeptide chains (PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, -CC, and -DD) (1Fredriksson L. Li H. Eriksson U. The PDGF family: four gene products form five dimeric isoforms.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). PDGF isoforms exert their cellular effects via binding to two related tyrosine kinase receptors, i.e. PDGF receptor α (PDGFRα) that binds PDGF-A, -B, and -C chains, and PDGFRβ that binds PDGF-B and -D chains. Ligand binding induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptors. Because of their binding specificities, the different PDGF isoforms induce characteristic dimeric receptor complexes (i.e. αα, αβ, ββ), which have overlapping, but also distinct, functional properties (2Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Mechanism of action and in vivo role of platelet-derived growth factor.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar).

Overactivity of PDGFRs is implicated in diseases involving excessive cell growth, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and fibrosis (for review, see Ref. 4Andrae J. Gallini R. Betsholtz C. Role of platelet-derived growth factors in physiology and medicine.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1276-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Fer is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that in addition to the kinase domain contains an Src homology 2 domain, coiled-coil domains, and an FCH (Fer/Fes/Fps/Cip4 homology) domain (5Greer P. Closing in on the biological functions of Fps/Fes and Fer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fer is closely related to Fes/Fps, which has a more restricted and primarily hematopoietic expression. Functionally, Fer or the related Fes/Fps has been proposed to be involved in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (6Jücker M. McKenna K. da Silva A.J. Rudd C.E. Feldman R.A.

A recent phosphoproteome profiling study identified phosphorylated Fer to be associated with invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting an important role for Fer in tumor progression (12Li H. Ren Z. Kang X. Zhang L. Li X. Wang Y. Xue T. Shen Y. Liu Y.

Previous reports have shown that upon acute PDGF stimulation, Fer becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with the activated receptor (13Kim L. Wong T.W. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase FER is associated with the catenin-like substrate pp120 and is activated by growth factors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, PDGF treatment also induces the formation of a complex between Fer and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, suggesting that Fer may bind PDGFR also indirectly via p85 (14Iwanishi M. Czech M.P. Cherniack A.D. The protein-tyrosine kinase Fer associates with signaling complexes containing insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.J. Biol.

STAT proteins make up a group of transcription factors (STAT1–6) that are activated through phosphorylation by growth factors and cytokines. Phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they drive expression of specific genes. STAT3 is frequently found to be activated in human cancers (for review, see Ref. 15Frank D.A. STAT3 as a central mediator of neoplastic cellular transformation.Cancer Lett. 2007; 251: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); hence, it is important to understand the mechanisms controlling the function of this transcription factor. The aim of the present investigation was to elucidate the mode of interaction and activation of Fer by PDGFRβ as well as the role the Fer protein in PDGF-BB-induced signal transduction and tumorigenicity. Recombinant human PDGF-BB was generously provided by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). The inhibitors SU6656 and AG490 were from Calbiochem. STI571 was from Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Antibodies against Fer (sc-81272), Fps/Fes (sc-25415), phosphotyrosine (sc-7029), enolase (sc-15343), Akt (sc-8312), and PDGFRβ (sc-339) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit antiserum recognizing ERK2 or Alix was raised against peptides corresponding to the sequences EETARFQPGYRS or CSYPFPQPPQQSYYPQQ conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, respectively. Antisera against phosphorylated ERK1/2 (9106), phosphorylated Akt (9271), phosphorylated Tyr-857-PDGFR (3170), phosphorylated STAT3 (9131), phosphorylated STAT5 (9351), and STAT5 (9352) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. STAT3 (610189) antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. α-Tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (BLU502A) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NIH3T3 or sis3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For serum starvation, cells were washed once and incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum. Down-regulation of Fer was performed by using 100 nm specific siRNA (RNA sequence: GGUGAAGUAUAUAAGGGCACAUUAAdTdT) purchased from Invitrogen or Fer-specific siGENOME from Dharmacon (siGENOME, D-045318-02). For every experiment performed, luciferase-targeting siRNA (RNA sequence CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT) was used as a control. Transfection of siRNA was done for 24 h with SilentFect from Bio-Rad. Levels of knockdown were tested after an additional 48 h by measuring protein levels by immunoblotting. All experiments were performed with Fer targeting siRNA-1 and then confirmed with siRNA-2. Both Fer siRNAs efficiently silenced Fer expression (Fig. 1). Sis3T3 cells were seeded to 30% confluence. The next day, 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine was added to the cells in fresh medium. An equal number of five different Fer shRNA lentivirus particles and one control lentivirus construct were added. After a gentle swirl the plate was incubated 18–20 h at 37 °C. Next, the medium containing the lentivirus particles was removed, and fresh selection medium containing 3 μg/ml puromycin was added to select for stable Fer shRNA and ctr shRNA silencing clones. The selection medium was exchanged every 3–4 days until resistant clones could be identified. To ensure a high efficiency in the silencing, we performed another round of lentiviral infection. Subconfluent cells, transfected as indicated, were starved and stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for the indicated periods of time. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and equal amounts of lysates were boiled with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P), which were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions and membranes incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (both from Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were visualized using enhanced chemoluminescence Western blotting detection systems from Roche Applied Science on a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Fuji, Minami-Ashigata, Japan). Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol), supplemented with 1 mm Pefabloc and 1 mm Na3VO4. Peptides of 15–20 amino acid residues in length derived from the sequence surrounding Tyr-579, Tyr-581, Tyr-716, Tyr-740, Tyr-751, Tyr-763, Tyr-771, Tyr-775, Tyr-778, Tyr-857, Tyr-1009, and Tyr-1021 in PDGFRβ, either phosphorylated or not, were synthesized with the addition of a N-terminal cysteine residue to enable coupling to Sulfolink (Pierce)-beads according to the manufacturer's instructions. Coupled peptides were incubated with cell lysates for 2 h rotating at 4 °C. Subsequently, beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and attached proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in reducing sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against Fer. Cells were transfected with Fer or control siRNA, as described above, and seeded into 12-well plates. Cells were serum-starved and incubated with 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine and increasing concentrations of PDGF-BB or 10% FBS overnight. Macromolecules including DNA were then precipitated using 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by washing in water and then dissolved in 1 m NaOH. The solutions were then neutralized with HCl, and radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Subconfluent cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and stimulated with PDGF-BB for 5 min, followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation with Fer antibodies and in vitro kinase assay using acid-denatured enolase as a substrate, as described (16Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Association between the PDGF receptor and members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases.Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A polycarbonate membrane (polyvinylpyrrolidone-free, pore size, 8.0 μm; NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD) was coated with 50 μg/ml fibronectin (BD Biosciences). Different concentrations of PDGF-BB were added to the lower chambers, and cells were added to the upper chambers at 3 × 104 cells/well. After 4 h of incubation, cells remaining on the upper membrane surface were removed, and the cells that had traversed and spread on the lower surface of the filter were fixed with ethanol and stained with Giemsa. The migrated cells were quantified with a cooled CCD camera (Fuji). Colony formation and cell growth rate in soft agar were tested by plating 2.5 × 104 sis3T3 cells transfected with control or Fer siRNA in 0.4 ml of DMEM, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml amphotericin B, 3% FBS, and 0.3% low melting temperature agarose (Seaplaque) in 12-well plates (6 wells for each) coated with 0.8 ml of 0.6% low melting temperature agarose. PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) was added to half of the wells of each type of siRNA-transfected cells. Colony formation of each type of siRNA-transfected cells was monitored for 5 days in 37 °C incubator, and colony number and size was recorded for comparison and then microphotographed by Axiovert 40 CFL microscope. Animal experiments were approved by the local ethical committee and performed according to the UKCCCR guidelines. All manipulations were performed under isoflurane (Abbott Scandinavia, Solna, Sweden) gas anesthesia. BALB/c nude mice (5–6 weeks old) received subcutaneous inoculation in the dorsal skinfold of 2 × 106 control and Fer-shRNA-transfected sis3T3 cells suspended in 100 μl of cold PBS. The cells were growing at 40–50% confluence before collection. Tumor length and width were measured using calipers, and tumor volume was calculated as π/6 x length × width × width. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to determine p values, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Previous reports have shown that Fer can interact with the PDGF receptor (13Kim L. Wong T.W. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase FER is associated with the catenin-like substrate pp120 and is activated by growth factors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Iwanishi M. Czech M.P. Cherniack A.D. The protein-tyrosine kinase Fer associates with signaling complexes containing insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38995-39000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, we treated NIH3T3 cells with PDGF-BB and performed immunoprecipitation with Fer-specific antibodies and immunoblotting against phosphotyrosine, PDGFRβ, and Fer. In concurrence with earlier reports, we found that PDGF-BB stimulation caused tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer and co-immunoprecipitation with the activated PDGFRβ (Fig. 2A). To characterize further the interaction between Fer and PDGFRβ, we investigated which tyrosine residues in PDGFRβ mediate the interaction with Fer, by in vitro peptide pulldown assays using peptides corresponding to the autophosphorylation sites in the receptor, either tyrosine-phosphorylated or not. We observed robust interactions with peptides containing tyrosine residues 579 and 581 in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor, as well as with peptides containing tyrosine residues 740 and 1021 (Fig. 2B). All interactions were dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the peptides. A alignment of the amino acid sequences from the identified binding sites (Fig. 2C) revealed, with the exception of Tyr-1021, a negatively charged amino acid in position +2 from the phosphotyrosine binding sites (because Tyr-581 is phosphorylated in the Tyr-579 sequence) and a hydrophobic amino acid in position +1. It should be noted that we cannot conclude from the peptide pulldown assay whether the binding is direct or indirect, and this may influence the binding sequence requirements. Next, we investigated whether phosphorylation of Fer is performed directly by the PDGFR or whether other downstream kinases are involved. Therefore, we determined the effect of low molecular mass inhibitors against PDGFRβ (STI571), Src family kinases (SU6656), and Jak kinases (AG490) on Fer phosphorylation. Whereas inhibition of the kinase activity of the PDGFRβ blocked Fer phosphorylation, inhibition of Src or Jak activity did not affect the PDGF-BB-induced Fer phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). To conclude, Fer binds to several autophosphorylation sites in PDGFRβ. Following Fer binding to the receptor complex, it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in a manner sensitive to PDGF receptor kinase inhibition, but not to inhibition of Src and Jak kinases, suggesting that Fer may be phosphorylated directly by the receptor. Many signaling proteins become activated by PDGF stimulation in a transient manner. To elucidate the kinetics of Fer activation, we stimulated cells for different periods of time with PDGF-BB and analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer. We found that Fer was rapidly phosphorylated by PDGF-BB and that this phosphorylation was maintained for at least 8 h of continuous stimulation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, autophosphorylation of PDGFRβ was maximal at 5–15 min of PDGF-BB stimulation and then declined upon longer stimulation (Fig. 3A). We next investigated whether the observed Fer phosphorylation was correlated with its kinase activity. Fer was immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated with PDGF-BB for different time periods and washed with high salt lysis buffer to remove potential co-immunoprecipitating proteins. An in vitro kinase reaction was performed using acid-denatured enolase as an exogenous substrate; robust enolase and Fer phosphorylations throughout the time course of stimulation were observed (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Fer tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with increased enzymatic activity. Furthermore, no significant effect of STI571 on Fer kinase activity was observed if STI571 was added to the lysates from PDGF-BB-stimulated cells (Fig. 4), arguing against a direct effect of STI571 on Fer kinase activity in the immunoblot experiment shown in Fig. 2D. However, it should be noted that STI571 also inhibits other kinases, such as c-Kit and Abl, whose contribution cannot be excluded in our experiment. To assess the involvement of Fer in PDGF-BB-induced signal transduction, we down-regulated Fer with siRNA and analyzed the activation of major pathways downstream of the PDGF receptor, including ERK1/2, Akt, STAT3, and STAT5. We found that after Fer down-regulation, PDGF-BB was not able to induce STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Other pathways analyzed, i.e. STAT5, ERK1/2, and Akt, were not dramatically affected by Fer silencing. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in PDGFRβ autophosphorylation, suggesting that Fer phosphorylates the receptor (Fig. 5A). The effect of Fer knockdown on STAT3 and PDGFRβ phosphorylation was confirmed using a second siRNA which gave similar results (data not shown). Notably, the strong effect of Fer silencing on STAT3 phosphorylation occurred predominantly in sparse cell cultures and required efficient reduction in Fer protein expression (>90%). The reason for the cell density dependence is not clear, but may relate to up- or down-regulation of proteins or miRNAs affecting STAT3 phosphorylation in a cell density-dependent manner. Despite our finding that down-regulation of Fer abolished the PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, a study on fibroblasts from mice into which kinase-deficient Fer had been knocked in, did not report any effect of PDGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (17Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Williams K. Cole L.A. Greer P.A. Mice devoid of Fer protein-tyrosine kinase activity are viable and fertile but display reduced cortactin phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the possibility that Fer has a kinase-independent role in PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, by down-regulating the kinase-deficient Fer in the knock-in cell line. As can be seen in Fig. 5B, cells in which the wild-type Fer was replaced with kinase-dead Fer transfected with control siRNA were capable of inducing STAT3 phosphorylation in response to PDGF-BB treatment, as reported previously (17Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Williams K. Cole L.A. Greer P.A. Mice devoid of Fer protein-tyrosine kinase activity are viable and fertile but display reduced cortactin phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); however, when the expression of kinase-deficient Fer was down-regulated with siRNA, PDGF-BB did not activate STAT3. Activation of STAT5 or PDGFRβ was not appreciably affected by down-regulation of Fer expression or loss of its kinase activity (Fig. 5B). Thus, Fer may have a kinase-independent function in PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 activation. It has been suggested that Src family kinases are involved in growth factor-induced STAT activation (for review, see Ref. 18Silva C.M. Role of STATs as downstream signal transducers in Src family kinase-mediated tumorigenesis.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8017-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Additionally, Jak kinases are established activators of STAT signaling downstream of cytokines receptors. Therefore, we investigated STAT3 and STAT5 activation in response to PDGF-BB in the presence of the Src kinase inhibitor SU6656 or the Jak inhibitor AG490. Suppression of Src activity resulted in a reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation, but no effect was observed on STAT5 or PDGFRβ phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). In contrast, treatment with the Jak inhibitor AG490 did not have any effect on PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 or STAT5 activation (Fig. 6A). Because we observed inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation when Fer was down-regulated as well as after Src inhibition, we tested whether Fer down-regulation affected the PDGF-BB-induced Src activation. We found that reduction of Fer expression in NIH3T3 cells suppressed PDGF-BB-induced Src activation, although it should be noted that the basal Src kinase activity increased (Fig. 6B), indicating a role for Fer in PDGF-BB-induced Src activation. Our results suggest that Fer, but not its kinase activity, is required for efficient STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). In addition, Src kinases are also involved because SU6656 inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, Fer may be involved in Src activation (Fig. 6B). Therefore, we investigated whether Fer and Src could form a complex. Indeed, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments we could observe a rapid interaction between Src and Fer (Fig. 6C). To elucidate whether Fer silencing affects the ability of PDGF-BB to promote cell proliferation, we performed [3H]thymidine incorporation assay to measure DNA synthesis. We found no significant difference in PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis between control and Fer-silenced cells (Fig. 7A). PDGFs are known to regulate cell migration, and previous reports have suggested a function of Fer or Fes/Fps in focal contacts (6Jücker M. McKenna K. da Silva A.J. Rudd C.E. Feldman R.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether silencing of Fer expression affected chemotaxis of NIH3T3 cells toward PDGF-BB. However, we were not able to observe any significant effects of Fer down-regulation on cell migration toward different concentrations of PDGF-BB (Fig. 7B). Because the Fer-related Fes/Fps kinase was initially identified as an oncogene product of a transforming retrovirus (20Snyder S.P. Theilen G.H. Transmissible feline fibrosarcoma.Nature. 1969; 221: 1074-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we investigated whether silencing of Fer expression affected the in vitro transforming ability of sis3T3 cells, which are NIH3T3 cells expressing the PDGF-B-like v-Sis oncoprotein; these cells form colonies in soft agar due to a PDGF-BB-driven autocrine loop. As can be seen in Fig. 7C, sis3T3 cells formed colonies in soft agar, and PDGF-BB stimulation enhanced colony growth. Down-regulation of Fer caused a marked reduction in the number of colonies formed (containing >50 cells) with or without PDGF-BB stimulation; in fact, we were unable to detect any colonies larger than 100 cells in Fer siRNA-transfected conditions, whereas such colonies could be readily seen under control conditions. To explore the role of Fer in tumorigenesis further, we inoculated BALB/c nude mice with sis3T3 cells depleted of Fer expression by shRNA. We found that Fer-depleted tumor cells had a reduced ability to initiate tumor growth (Fig. 7D). In summary, Fer has no or a redundant role in PDGF-BB-induced cell proliferation and migration; however, it exerts a major influence on colony formation in soft agar of sis3T3 cells and on the initiation of tumor growth in vivo. In the present study, we have confirmed and extended the previous reports that Fer interacts with the PDGFR in a Src homology 2 domain-dependent manner (13Kim L. Wong T.W.

The strongest interaction was detected with phosphorylated Tyr-579 and Tyr-581, which also are major Src kinase binding sites (21Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Yokote K. Engström A. Courtneidge S.A.

Identification of two juxtamembrane autophosphorylation sites in the PDGF β-receptor; involvement in the interaction with Src family tyrosine kinases.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), as well as with Tyr-1021 in the C-terminal tail of the receptor that also binds phospholipase Cγ (22Rönnstrand L.

Fer also bound phosphorylated Tyr-740, although this may be indirect because PI3-kinase binds to Tyr(P)-740, and an interaction between Fer and the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase has been reported (14Iwanishi M. Czech M.P. Cherniack A.D. The protein-tyrosine kinase Fer associates with signaling complexes containing insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38995-39000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our studies on Fer activation in response to PDGF-BB stimulation showed that Fer is phosphorylated independently of Src and Jak kinase activities, suggesting that phosphorylation and activation occur directly by the receptor kinase. A kinetic analysis revealed that Fer is rapidly activated by PDGF-BB and remains active up to 8 h, i.e. long after the autophosphorylation of the receptor has declined. The mechanism for the extended Fer activation is not known; it is possible that the PDGFRβ-induced phosphorylation is sustained by subsequent Fer autophosphorylation within the trimeric complex where it has been shown to reside (23Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Greer P. Disruption of coiled-coil domains in Fer protein-tyrosine kinase abolishes trimerization but not kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fer, or the related Fes/Fps kinase, has been implicated in various signal transduction pathways. For example, expression of an activated form of Fes/Fps causes a potentiation of GM-CSF-, Epo-, and SCF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5, and ERK1/2 (24Sangrar W. Gao Y. Zirngibl R.A.

Overexpression of Fer in COS cells, or stimulation of myogenic or human prostate cancer cells with insulin or IL6, respectively, resulted in complex formation between Fer and STAT3 as well as STAT3 phosphorylation (10Zoubeidi A.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1580-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fer has also been shown to be important for sustained ERK1/2 activation and VEGF expression under hypoxic conditions (28Salem Y. Shpungin S. Pasder O. Pomp O. Taler M. Malovani H. Nir U. Fer kinase sustains the activation level of ERK1/2 and increases the production of VEGF in hypoxic cells.Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we investigated the PDGF-BB-induced activation of STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2, Akt, and PDGFRβ in NIH3T3 cells under conditions with siRNA-mediated silencing of Fer expression. We found that STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on the presence of Fer, whereas other pathways were not much affected. In contrast to previous studies where a complex between Fer and STAT3 could be observed after cytokine stimulation (10Zoubeidi A. Rocha J. Zouanat F.Z. Hamel L. Scarlata E. Aprikian A.G. Chevalier S. The Fer tyrosine kinase cooperates with interleukin-6 to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and promote human prostate cancer cell growth.Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 142-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Taler M. Shpungin S. Salem Y. Malovani H. Pasder O. Nir U. Fer is a downstream effector of insulin and mediates the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in myogenic cells.Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1580-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect such a complex after PDGF-BB treatment (data not shown). In addition to abolished STAT3 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of PDGFRβ was also reduced in the absence of Fer; however, the importance of this finding is unclear because all pathways investigated, except STAT3, as well as cell proliferation and chemotaxis, were activated to a more or less normal extent. Mice have been generated expressing a mutant Fer lacking tyrosine kinase activity, and they are viable and fertile (17Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Williams K. Cole L.A. Greer P.A. Mice devoid of Fer protein-tyrosine kinase activity are viable and fertile but display reduced cortactin phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas PDGF stimulation of fibroblasts derived from these mice displayed normal STAT3 phosphorylation, knockdown of the kinase-deficient Fer inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation. These observations suggest that Fer may have a kinase-independent role in STAT3 activation. In fact, a kinase-independent role for the Fer ortholog FRK-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans has been demonstrated in embryonic closure and morphogenesis (29Putzke A.P. Hikita S.T. Clegg D.O. Rothman J.H. Essential kinase-independent role of a Fer-like non-receptor tyrosine kinase in Caenorhabditis elegans morphogenesis.Development. 2005; 132: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that Fer functions as an adaptor protein in the process of PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 activation, although further investigations are needed to clarify this issue. Src and Jak kinases have been implicated in activation of STATs in different receptor systems. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of Src and Jak in PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 and STAT5 activation using low molecular mass inhibitors. Our data showed that PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was sensitive to Src kinase inhibition but not to Jak inhibition; however, consistent with a previous report (30Paukku K. Valgeirsdóttir S. Saharinen P. Bergman M. Heldin C.H. Silvennoinen O. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 is mediated by PDGF β-receptor and is not dependent on c-Src, Fyn, Jak1 or Jak2 kinases.Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), STAT5 phosphorylation requires neither Src nor Jak activity. We showed that Src activity is not essential for PDGF-BB-induced Fer activation. Importantly, silencing of Fer did not influence Src kinase expression (Fig. 8). In contrast, under conditions of reduced Fer expression, PDGF-BB was not able to increase Src kinase activity. However, the basal Src kinase activity was increased, which may relate to the fact that both Fer and Src interact with Tyr-579 and Tyr-581 in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor. Thus, it is possible that Src and Fer compete for binding, and when Fer is absent Src may interact more efficiently. Collectively, our data on STAT3 phosphorylation are compatible with a scenario where Fer is a component of a scaffolding complex that contributes to Src activation and thus facilitates STAT3 phosphorylation. Consistent with this possibility we could detect a rapid and transient complex formation between Fer and Src kinases in response to PDGF-BB. Fer, Fes/Fps, and STAT3 have been implicated in cell biological processes such as proliferation and cell migration. However, our results showed that there was no significant effect on PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis or chemotaxis in cells where Fer was silenced. This result contrasts with what has been reported for IL6-induced proliferation, where Fer-mediated activation of STAT3 promotes PC-3 cell proliferation (10Zoubeidi A. Rocha J. Zouanat F.Z. Hamel L. Scarlata E. Aprikian A.G. Chevalier S. The Fer tyrosine kinase cooperates with interleukin-6 to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and promote human prostate cancer cell growth.Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 142-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and suggests that Fer may have a redundant role in PDGF-BB-induced proliferation and migration in our experimental model. Notably, we were unable to detect expression of the related Fes/Fps protein in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 9), indicating that other pathways are involved. STAT3 has been shown to promote expression of a large number of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation (for review, see Ref. 31Aggarwal B.B. Kunnumakkara A.B. Harikumar K.B. Gupta S.R. Tharakan S.T. Koca C. Dey S. Sung B. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, inflammation, and cancer: how intimate is the relationship?.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1171: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that aberrant activation of STAT3 has been observed frequently in various cancers (for review, see Ref. 32Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. STATs in oncogenesis.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Because the major signaling defect we were able to identify in cells with reduced Fer expression was abolished PDGF-BB-induced STAT3 activation, we investigated whether this could affect tumorigenesis as determined by in vitro colony formation in soft agar. We found that NIH3T3 cells with an autocrine activation of PDGF receptors were not able to form colonies in soft agar when the Fer expression was silenced using siRNA, consistent with the notion that STAT3 is important for tumorigenicity. In fact, expression of a constitutively activated mutant form of STAT3 has been shown to promote NIH3T3 and 3Y1 fibroblasts to form colonies in soft agar and for the 3Y1 cells also tumors in mice (33Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stat3 as an oncogene.Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). When we inoculated nude BALB/c mice with sis3T3 cells stably depleted of Fer, we observed a strong reduction in tumor formation. This suggests that Fer may play a crucial role in PDGF-induced tumorigenesis. To conclude, we have demonstrated that Fer binds to the activated PDGFRβ through multiple tyrosine residues and becomes activated in a sustained manner. Reducing the expression of Fer resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas other pathways were not dramatically affected. Functionally, we found that Fer expression was critical for the ability of an autocrine PDGF-BB-driven loop to promote in vitro transformation and in the initiation of tumor growth in vivo. Our results suggest that Fer kinase may play an important role in PDGF-driven tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2028096902,"We have recently reported that cannabinoid agonists can up-regulate and enhance the activity of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFCx). Increased expression and activity of cortical 5-HT2A receptors has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and schizophrenia. Here we report that repeated CP55940 exposure selectively up-regulates GRK5 proteins in rat PFCx and in a neuronal cell culture model. We sought to examine the mechanism underlying the regulation of GRK5 and to identify the role of GRK5 in the cannabinoid agonist-induced up-regulation and enhanced activity of 5-HT2A receptors. Interestingly, we found that cannabinoid agonist-induced up-regulation of GRK5 involves CB2 receptors, β-arrestin 2, and ERK1/2 signaling because treatment with CB2 shRNA lentiviral particles, β-arrestin 2 shRNA lentiviral particles, or ERK1/2 inhibitor prevented the cannabinoid agonist-induced up-regulation of GRK5. Most importantly, we found that GRK5 shRNA lentiviral particle treatment prevented the cannabinoid agonist-induced up-regulation and enhanced 5-HT2A receptor-mediated calcium release. Repeated cannabinoid exposure was also associated with enhanced phosphorylation of CB2 receptors and increased interaction between β-arrestin 2 and ERK1/2. These latter phenomena were also significantly inhibited by GRK5 shRNA lentiviral treatment. Our results suggest that sustained activation of CB2 receptors, which up-regulates 5-HT2A receptor signaling, enhances GRK5 expression; the phosphorylation of CB2 receptors; and the β-arrestin 2/ERK interactions. These data could provide a rationale for some of the adverse effects associated with repeated cannabinoid agonist exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2091121528,"The complement system is an ancient innate immune defense pathway that plays a front line role in eliminating microbial pathogens. Recognition of foreign targets by antibodies drives sequential activation of two serine proteases, C1r and C1s, which reside within the complement Component 1 (C1) complex. Active C1s propagates the immune response through its ability to bind and cleave the effector molecule complement Component 4 (C4). Currently, the precise structural and biochemical basis for the control of the interaction between C1s and C4 is unclear. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we show that the transition of the C1s zymogen to the active form is essential for C1s binding to C4. To understand this, we determined the crystal structure of a zymogen C1s construct (comprising two complement control protein (CCP) domains and the serine protease (SP) domain). These data reveal that two loops (492-499 and 573-580) in the zymogen serine protease domain adopt a conformation that would be predicted to sterically abrogate C4 binding. The transition from zymogen to active C1s repositions both loops such that they would be able to interact with sulfotyrosine residues on C4. The structure also shows the junction of the CCP1 and CCP2 domains of C1s for the first time, yielding valuable information about the exosite for C4 binding located at this position. Together, these data provide a structural explanation for the control of the interaction with C1s and C4 and, furthermore, point to alternative strategies for developing therapeutic approaches for controlling activation of the complement cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2092093407,"Monitoring of harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in coastal waters is important for assessment of environmental impacts associated with HABs. Co-occurrence of multiple cryptic species such as toxic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis species make reliable microscopic identification difficult, so the employment of molecular tools is often necessary. Here we developed new qPCR method by which cells of cryptic species can be enumerated based on actual gene number of target species. The qPCR assay targets the LSU rDNA of Ostreopsis spp. from Japan. First, we constructed standard curves with a linearized plasmid containing the target rDNA. We then determined the number of rDNA copies per cell of target species from a single cell isolated from environmental samples using the qPCR assay. Differences in the DNA recovery efficiency was calculated by adding exogenous plasmid to a portion of the sample lysate before and after DNA extraction followed by qPCR. Then, the number of cells of each species was calculated by division of the total number of rDNA copies of each species in the samples by the number of rDNA copies per cell. To test our procedure, we determined the total number of rDNA copies using environmental samples containing no target cells but spiked with cultured cells of several species of Ostreopsis. The numbers estimated by the qPCR method closely approximated total numbers of cells added. Finally, the numbers of cells of target species in environmental samples containing cryptic species were enumerated by the qPCR method and the total numbers also closely approximated the microscopy cell counts. We developed a qPCR method that provides accurate enumeration of each cryptic species in environments. This method is expected to be a powerful tool for monitoring the various HAB species that occur as cryptic species in coastal waters."
https://openalex.org/W1984124563,"Antibiotics target bacteria by interfering with essential processes such as translation, but their effects on translation in mammalian cells are less well characterized. We found that doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and Geneticin (G418) interfered with insertion of selenocysteine (Sec), which is encoded by the stop codon, UGA, into selenoproteins in murine EMT6 cells. Treatment of EMT6 cells with these antibiotics reduced enzymatic activities and Sec insertion into thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1). However, these proteins were differentially affected due to varying errors in Sec insertion at UGA. In the presence of doxycycline, chloramphenicol, or G418, the Sec-containing form of TR1 decreased, whereas the arginine-containing and truncated forms of this protein increased. We also detected antibiotic-specific misinsertion of cysteine and tryptophan. Furthermore, misinsertion of arginine in place of Sec was commonly observed in GPx1 and glutathione peroxidase 4. TR1 was the most affected and GPx1 was the least affected by these translation errors. These observations were consistent with the differential use of two Sec tRNA isoforms and their distinct roles in supporting accuracy of Sec insertion into selenoproteins. The data reveal widespread errors in inserting Sec into proteins and in dysregulation of selenoprotein expression and function upon antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2031744581,"Chloromethane (CH3Cl) is the most abundant volatile halocarbon in the atmosphere and contributes to the destruction of stratospheric ozone. The only known pathway for bacterial chloromethane utilization (cmu) was characterized in Methylobacterium extorquens CM4, a methylotrophic bacterium able to utilize compounds without carbon-carbon bonds such as methanol and chloromethane as the sole carbon source for growth. Previous work demonstrated that tetrahydrofolate and vitamin B12 are essential cofactors of cmuA- and cmuB-encoded methyltransferases of chloromethane dehalogenase, and that the pathway for chloromethane utilization is distinct from that for methanol. This work reports genomic and proteomic data demonstrating that cognate cmu genes are located on the 380 kb pCMU01 plasmid, which drives the previously defined pathway for tetrahydrofolate-mediated chloromethane dehalogenation. Comparison of complete genome sequences of strain CM4 and that of four other M. extorquens strains unable to grow with chloromethane showed that plasmid pCMU01 harbors unique genes without homologs in the compared genomes (bluB2, btuB, cobA, cbiD), as well as 13 duplicated genes with homologs of chromosome-borne genes involved in vitamin B12-associated biosynthesis and transport, or in tetrahydrofolate-dependent metabolism (folC2). In addition, the presence of both chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes for corrinoid salvaging pathways may ensure corrinoid coenzyme supply in challenging environments. Proteomes of M. extorquens CM4 grown with one-carbon substrates chloromethane and methanol were compared. Of the 49 proteins with differential abundance identified, only five (CmuA, CmuB, PurU, CobH2 and a PaaE-like uncharacterized putative oxidoreductase) are encoded by the pCMU01 plasmid. The mainly chromosome-encoded response to chloromethane involves gene clusters associated with oxidative stress, production of reducing equivalents (PntAA, Nuo complex), conversion of tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon units, and central metabolism. The mosaic organization of plasmid pCMU01 and the clustering of genes coding for dehalogenase enzymes and for biosynthesis of associated cofactors suggests a history of gene acquisition related to chloromethane utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2058704484,"Dentin phosphophoryn is nature's most acidic protein found predominantly in the dentin extracellular matrix. Its unique amino acid composition containing Asp-Ser (DS)-rich repeats makes it highly anionic. It has a low isoelectric point (pI 1.1) and, therefore, tends to be negatively charged at physiological pH. Phosphophoryn is normally associated with matrix mineralization as it can bind avidly to Ca(2+). It is well known that several macromolecules present in the extracellular matrix can be internalized and localized to specific intracellular compartments. In this study we demonstrate that dentin phosphophoryn (DPP) is internalized by several cell types via a non-conventional endocytic process. Utilizing a DSS polypeptide derived from DPP, we demonstrate the repetitive DSS-rich domain facilitates that endocytosis. As a proof-of-concept, we further demonstrate the use of this polypeptide as a protein delivery vehicle by delivering the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2 to the nucleus of mesenchymal cells. The functionality of the endocytosed Runx2 protein was demonstrated by performing gene expression analysis of Runx2 target genes. Nuclear localization was also demonstrated with the fusion protein DSS-Runx2 conjugated to quantum dots in two- and three-dimensional culture models in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we demonstrate that the DSS domain of DPP functions as a novel cell-penetrating peptide, and these findings demonstrate new opportunities for intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins and cell tracking in vivo."

Treatment of mouse hepatic stellate cells with ethanol significantly increased Slc7a11 mRNA and protein levels. Deletion of a 20-bp DNA sequence between −2044 to −2024 upstream of the transcription start site significantly increased basal activity and completely abolished the ethanol-induced activity of the Slc7a11 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2158569415,"The cellular activation of conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes is initiated by the binding of their C2 domains to membranes in response to elevations in intracellular Ca(2+). Following this C2 domain-mediated membrane recruitment, the C1 domain binds its membrane-embedded ligand diacylglycerol, resulting in activation of PKC. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms by which the C2 domain controls the initial step in the activation of PKC. Using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy to measure association and dissociation rate constants, we show that hydrophobic interactions are the major driving force in the binding of the C2 domain to anionic membranes, whereas electrostatic interactions dominate in membrane retention. Specifically, mutation of select hydrophobic or select basic residues in the Ca(2+)-binding loops reduces membrane affinity by distinct mechanisms; mutation of hydrophobic residues primarily alters association rate constants, whereas mutation of charged residues affects dissociation rate constants. Live cell imaging reveals that introduction of these mutations into full-length PKCα not only reduces the Ca(2+)-dependent translocation to plasma membrane but, by impairing the plasma membrane-sensing role of the C2 domain, causes phorbol ester-triggered redistribution of PKCα to other membranes, such as the Golgi. These data underscore the key role of the C2 domain in driving conventional PKC isozymes to the plasma membrane and reveal that not only the amplitude but also the subcellular location of conventional PKC signaling can be tuned by altering the affinity of this module for membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2144113849,"Bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the origin of bone-forming cells with immunomodulation potential. HLA-G5 is among the generated immunosuppressive molecules. HLA-G proteins play a crucial role in promoting the acceptance of allografts. However, the mechanisms regulating the expression of HLA-G5 in human MSCs are unknown. We induced differentiation of MSCs and found that HLA-G5 was greatly up-regulated only in osteoblastic cells (+63% for mRNA). Growth plates and bone callus postfracture in adults showed that only bone-lining cells and mesenchymal progenitors were positive for HLA-G5. Use of gene silencing and dominant-negative factors revealed that HLA-G5 depends on the expression and function of the skeletogenesis master genes RUNX2 and DLX5. In addition, HLA-G5 could directly inhibit osteoclastogenesis by acting on monocytes through SHP1. However, in mature osteoblasts, the expression of HLA-G5 protein was greatly suppressed whereas the proosteoclastogenic factor, RANKL, was concomitantly increased. Down-regulation of HLA-G5 expression during the maturation of osteoblasts was due to binding of the repressor GLI3, a signal transducer of the Hedgehog pathway, to the GLI binding element within the HLA-G promoter. Our findings show that mesenchymal progenitors and osteoblastic cells specifically express HLA-G5 during osteogenesis, with a key role in bone homeostasis."

During mouse development, Cubn is expressed in both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues, and Cubn gene inactivation results in early embryo lethality most likely due to the impairment of the function of extra-embryonic Cubn. Here, we focus on the developmental role of Cubn expressed in the embryonic head. We report that Cubn is a novel, interspecies-conserved Fgf receptor. Epiblast-specific inactivation of Cubn in the mouse embryo as well as Cubn silencing in the anterior head of frog or the cephalic neural crest of chick embryos show that Cubn is required during early somite stages to convey survival signals in the developing vertebrate head.

Although Cubn may not form stable ternary complexes with Fgf receptors (FgfRs), it acts together with and/or is necessary for optimal FgfR activity. We propose that plasma membrane binding of Fgf8, and most likely of the Fgf8 family members Fgf17 and Fgf18, to Cubn improves Fgf ligand endocytosis and availability to FgfRs, thus modulating Fgf signaling activity. Background: Cubilin is a multiligand endocytic receptor necessary for early embryonic development. Results: Cubilin expressed in the developing head, namely the cephalic neural crest, binds Fgf8 and is required for cell survival and head morphogenesis. Conclusion: Cubilin, Fgf8, and FgfRs act synergistically to promote anterior cell survival. Significance: Cubilin is a novel modulator of the Fgf8-FgfR signaling activity."
https://openalex.org/W2047551730,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex change in cell differentiation that allows breast carcinoma cells to acquire invasive properties. EMT involves a cascade of regulatory changes that destabilize the epithelial phenotype and allow mesenchymal features to manifest. As transcription factors (TFs) are upstream effectors of the genome-wide expression changes that result in phenotypic change, understanding the sequential changes in TF activity during EMT provides rich information on the mechanism of this process. Because molecular interactions will vary as cells progress from an epithelial to a mesenchymal differentiation program, dynamic networks are needed to capture the changing context of molecular processes. In this study we applied an emerging high-throughput, dynamic TF activity array to define TF activity network changes in three cell-based models of EMT in breast cancer based on HMLE Twist ER and MCF-7 mammary epithelial cells. The TF array distinguished conserved from model-specific TF activity changes in the three models. Time-dependent data was used to identify pairs of TF activities with significant positive or negative correlation, indicative of interdependent TF activity throughout the six-day study period. Dynamic TF activity patterns were clustered into groups of TFs that change along a time course of gene expression changes and acquisition of invasive capacity. Time-dependent TF activity data was combined with prior knowledge of TF interactions to construct dynamic models of TF activity networks as epithelial cells acquire invasive characteristics. These analyses show EMT from a unique and targetable vantage and may ultimately contribute to diagnosis and therapy."

It is now widely accepted that mosquito immune responses play a crucial role in restricting Plasmodium development within the vector; therefore, further dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes should inform new vector control strategies urgently needed to roll back the disease.

Malaria is the most widespread human infectious disease transmitted by an insect vector. It causes high levels of morbidity and mortality in Africa, especially in young children and pregnant women (1World Health Organization World Malaria Report. World Health Organization, Geneva2010Google Scholar). In the current absence of efficient vaccination programs, strategies for malaria elimination should be multifaceted and include drug therapy as well as mosquito vector population control (2Breman J.G. Alilio M.S. Mills A. Conquering the intolerable burden of malaria. What's new, what's needed. A summary.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004; 71: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 3Collins F.H.

The major malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa are mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex. The mosquito mounts a powerful immune response against Plasmodium infection, which kills most parasites during the first days of invasion (4Michel K. Kafatos F.C. Mosquito immunity against Plasmodium.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Boosting the mosquito immune system is a promising approach for blocking Plasmodium development within the vector to control malaria transmission (5Dong Y. Das S. Cirimotich C. Souza-Neto J.A.

Invertebrates rely exclusively on the innate type of immune responses for protection against microbial infections (7Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. The instructive role of innate immunity in the acquired immune response.Science. 1996; 272: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 8Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J. The host defense of Drosophila melanogaster.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 697-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). These responses are controlled by signaling pathways that are remarkably well conserved across the animal phyla. Genetic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster revealed four major immune pathways, Toll, Imd, JAK/STAT, and JNK, that contribute to induction of effector molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides and stress response genes (8Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J. The host defense of Drosophila melanogaster.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 697-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). In A. gambiae, homologues of the Toll and Imd pathways selectively induce target gene expression through the NF-κB transcription factors Rel1 and Rel2, respectively (9Barillas-Mury C. Charlesworth A. Gross I. Richman A. Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C.

Caspar controls resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in diverse anopheline species.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000335Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Activation of both the Rel1 and Rel2 pathways results in an efficient immune response against malaria parasites. This response is largely mediated by the mosquito complement-like system that, among others, comprises thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) and two leucine-rich repeat proteins, LRIM1 and APL1 (6Frolet C. Thoma M. Blandin S. Hoffmann J.A. Levashina E.A.

Dong Y. Dimopoulos G. Caspar controls resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in diverse anopheline species.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000335Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Activation of the Rel2 pathway appears to be more efficient at blocking the development of human Plasmodium falciparum parasites, whereas activation of the Rel1 impacts the development of the murine parasites Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium yoelii, often used as models to study Plasmodium-Anopheles interactions (5Dong Y. Das S. Cirimotich C. Souza-Neto J.A. McLean K.J. Dimopoulos G. Engineered Anopheles immunity to Plasmodium infection.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002458Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Garver L.S. Dong Y. Dimopoulos G. Caspar controls resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in diverse anopheline species.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000335Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that wounding of the mosquito by injection of water or dsRNA promotes TEP1-mediated killing of P. falciparum (12Nsango S.E. Abate L. Thoma M. Pompon J. Fraiture M. Rademacher A. Berry A. Awono-Ambene P.H. Levashina E.A. Morlais I. Genetic clonality of Plasmodium falciparum affects the outcome of infection in Anopheles gambiae.Int. J. Parasitol. 2012; 42: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The efficiency of this response was affected by the parasite genetic clonality because it was predominantly operating in infections with monoclonal, and to a lesser extent with biclonal, parasite isolates but not in infections containing three or more parasite clones. Wound response is a complex process initiated by an injury of epidermis. The hallmarks of this process are coagulation and clot formation that seal the wound site, thereby preventing hemolymph loss and limiting dissemination of infectious agents. In Drosophila, wound healing is similar to well characterized developmental processes that involve epithelial rearrangements, such as dorsal closure during embryonic development (13Wood W. Jacinto A. Grose R. Woolner S. Gale J. Wilson C. Martin P. Wound healing recapitulates morphogenesis in Drosophila embryos.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These processes involve massive cellular movements that help to establish or to renew cell-cell contacts and are regulated by the JNK pathway (13Wood W. Jacinto A. Grose R. Woolner S. Gale J. Wilson C. Martin P. Wound healing recapitulates morphogenesis in Drosophila embryos.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Regardless of the trigger, be it developmental reorganization or injury, wound healing elicits an immune response and primes the organism for what is likely to be an increased risk of infection (14Stramer B. Winfield M. Shaw T. Millard T.H. Woolner S. Martin P. Gene induction following wounding of wild-type versus macrophage-deficient Drosophila embryos.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In invertebrates, coagulation plays essential roles in morphogenesis, wound healing, and immunity and is carried out by transglutaminases (TGases), 4The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; GO, gene ontology; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; CLIP, clip domain serine protease; COI, complexity of infection. enzymes with protein cross-linking activity. TGases catalyze formation of isopeptide bonds between a free ϵ-amino group and glutamine residue in a Ca2+-dependent manner (15Furie B. Furie B.C.

Crosslinking enzymes with pleiotropic functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar) and are essential for a variety of biological processes. For instance, in the nematode Onchocerca volvulus, TGase-catalyzed cross-linking is crucial for the molting of third instar larvae (18Lustigman S. Brotman B. Huima T. Castelhano A.L. Singh R.N. Mehta K. Prince A.M. Transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction is important for molting of Onchocerca volvulus third-stage larvae.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1913-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas in Drosophila, TGase1 plays an essential role in pupal morphogenesis and cuticle schlerotization brought about by cross-linking of two cuticular chitin-binding proteins, larval serum protein 2 and a putative C-type lectin (19Shibata T. Ariki S. Shinzawa N. Miyaji R. Suyama H. Sako M. Inomata N. Koshiba T. Kanuka H. Kawabata S. Protein crosslinking by transglutaminase controls cuticle morphogenesis in Drosophila.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e13477Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). During immune responses in crayfish, hemolymph coagulation is achieved by TGase-mediated cross-linking of specific clotting proteins (20Kopàcek P. Hall M. Söderhäli K.

In the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus, a proteolytic coagulation cascade activated by septic injury converts coagulogen into insoluble coagulin. Further cross-linking of the coagulin polymers by TGases traps and immobilizes invading pathogens at sites of injury (23Matsuda Y. Koshiba T. Osaki T. Suyama H. Arisaka F. Toh Y. Kawabata S.

Recently, TGase function in immunity was revealed in Drosophila, where TGase1 mutant larvae displayed high susceptibility to infections with entomopathogenic nematodes harboring the symbiotic bacteria Photorhabdus bacteriophora (25Wang Z. Wilhelmsson C. Hyrsl P. Loof T.G. Dobes P. Klupp M. Loseva O. Mörgelin M. Iklé J. Cripps R.M. Herwald H. Theopold U. Pathogen entrapment by transglutaminase. A conserved early innate immune mechanism.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000763Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast to other insect species that rely on a single TGase, the genome of A. gambiae contains three genes coding for TGases. Phylogenetic analysis of TGases in A. gambiae, D. melanogaster, Culex pipiens, and Aedes aegypti revealed that AGAP009100 is an orthologue of TGase1 conserved in all insects, whereas AGAP009098 is an orthologue of TGase2 identified in mosquitoes of the genera Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex but not in Drosophila (26Rogers D.W. Baldini F. Battaglia F. Panico M. Dell A. Morris H.R. Catteruccia F. Transglutaminase-mediated semen coagulation controls sperm storage in the malaria mosquito.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The third TGase is encoded by AGAP009099 and is specific to A. gambiae, having no homologues in other species. It is expressed in the male accessory glands and cross-links proteins of the male seminal fluid into a coagulated proteinaceous plug transferred to females during mating (26Rogers D.W. Baldini F. Battaglia F. Panico M. Dell A. Morris H.R. Catteruccia F. Transglutaminase-mediated semen coagulation controls sperm storage in the malaria mosquito.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, we set out to identify mosquito factors responsible for the wounding-induced P. falciparum killing. A genome-wide transcriptional analysis identified 53 genes whose expression was significantly regulated upon wounding, including TGase1 and TGase2. We demonstrated that depletion of TGase2, but not of TGase1, restored the numbers of developing parasites to those observed in non-injected controls. Using bioinformatics and functional gene analysis by RNAi silencing, we further demonstrated that expression of TGase2 after wounding is regulated by the AP-1 transcriptional factor Fos, the transactivator of the JNK pathway in other animals. Our study identifies the novel role of TGase2 in the elimination of P. falciparum and unravels the importance of the AP-1/Fos-TGase2 axis in immune responses of mosquitoes to human malaria parasites. The A. gambiae sensu stricto Ngousso strain was originally established in 2006 at the Institut de Recherche de Yaoundé, Cameroon (OCEAC) from larvae collected in Yaoundé. The colony belongs to the M molecular and Forest chromosomal forms (standard chromosomal arrangements). Mosquitoes were reared in the insectary at 28.0 ± 2 °C and 80.0 ± 5% humidity with a 12/12-h dark/light cycle. Adults were fed on a 6% sugar solution through cotton pads, and the larvae diet consisted of ground fish food (Tetra). Fos and TGase2 were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with the following primers: Fos, AG356 (5′-GAGCCTCCCGATCTACTTTTGCTAC-3′) and AG357 (5′-TGGTTCGGTTTTAATTTTTGGCAGT-3′); TGase2, AG1197 (5′-GGGGAATTCGGCCGAACTAACGATTGAAA-3′) and AG1198 (5′-GGGGCGGCCGCCCGTTAGGCCATCCTCATTA-3′). Amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and subcloned as a 384-bp-long EcoRI-XhoI and 356-bp EcoRI-NotI into pLL10, resulting in pLL323 and pLL556, respectively. Plasmids pLL17 (dsTEP1), pLL100 (dsLacZ), and dsAGAP009100 (kind gift of Dr. D. Rogers, Imperial College London) were used, and the synthesis of dsRNAs was performed as described previously (27Blandin S. Moita L.F. Köcher T. Wilm M. Kafatos F.C. Levashina E.A. Reverse genetics in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Targeted disruption of the Defensin gene.EMBO J. 2002; 3: 852-856Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Gene silencing was achieved by injecting 0.2 μg of dsRNA into the thorax of 1-day-old females using a glass capillary mounted onto a Nanoject II injector (Drummond). A dsRNA targeting a bacterial gene absent from the mosquito genome (dsLacZ) served as a negative control in dsRNA injections. During injection, mosquitoes were immobilized by CO2, and non-injected mosquitoes were also exposed to CO2 treatment. To analyze changes in the transcriptome of mosquitoes after dsLacZ injection, we used a microarray approach. At 3 h after injection, 30 mosquitoes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C. Two independent experiments were performed using unrelated mosquito populations. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the supplier's instructions. RNA was resuspended in water to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl, and 10 μg were used for each microarray. The quality and amount of RNA were verified by measuring the optical density (OD) with Nanodrop and by an Affymetrix bioanalyzer. The complementary RNA and hybridization of the GeneChip array (GeneChip® Plasmodium/Anopheles Genome Array, Affymetrix) were performed at the IGBMC platform (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France) according to Affymetrix protocols. The GeneChip arrays, designed in 2002, included probe sets for ∼14,900 A. gambiae transcripts, which may not fully cover the mosquito genome due to incomplete genome annotation. Raw data were deposited in the Array Express archive and are available under the E-MEXP-3677 code. Intensity data for each probe set were calculated from images generated with the GeneChip scanner and were analyzed with Bioconductor software, which implements packages from the R language. Intensities were normalized according to the robust multiarray analysis method (28Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. A comparison of normalization methods for high density oligonucleotide array data based on variance and bias.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6397) Google Scholar) using the Affy package (29Gautier L.

GeneChip array data were quality-controlled using established bioinformatic methods (30Burgoon L.D. Eckel-Passow J.E. Gennings C. Boverhof D.R. Burt J.W. Fong C.J. Zacharewski T.R.

Affycoretools: Functions Useful for Those Doing Repetitive Analyses with Affymetrix GeneChips. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria2008Google Scholar). Probe sets with an absolute fold change greater than 2 were filtered, and significantly regulated probe sets (p < 0.05) were identified by conducting a moderated t test, which enhances statistical power compared with the classical t test by borrowing variance information from independent probe sets, 5D. M. Witten and R. Tibshirani, unpublished data. followed by p value adjustment according to the method of Westfall and Young (33Westfall P.H. Young S.S. Resampling-based Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for p-Value Adjustment. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar) using the Multtest package (34Pollard K.S. Gilbert H.N. Ge Y. Taylor S. Dudoit S. Multtest: Resampling-based Multiple Hypothesis Testing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria2004Google Scholar). Results were visualized in TreeView software after running a hierarchical clustering analysis with Cluster version 3.0 software (35de Hoon M.J. Imoto S. Nolan J. Miyano S. Open source clustering software.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar). To highlight gene ontology (GO) terms that were significantly enriched among the genes regulated by dsLacZ injection, we conducted a GO enrichment test using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 Web site. To identify genes potentially regulated by the same pathway, we conducted a k-means clustering analysis that groups genes with respect to similarity of their expression profiles. Affymetrix probe set expression data for the genes significantly regulated after dsLacZ injection and for Fos and Jun were retrieved from the A. gambiae Gene Expression Database at the University of California Irvine for the following conditions: BF3 (3 h post-blood feeding), BF24 (24 h post-blood feeding), and NBF (non-fed). The retrieved microarray data were normalized together with our microarray data as described above. k-means clustering analysis was conducted with k = 4 using the Stats package (36R Development Core Team R. A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria2011Google Scholar). To validate the results obtained with the GeneChip arrays, we compared the expression levels of 10 genes between microarray and qRT-PCR. Total RNA from 10 mosquitoes (non-injected control and dsLacZ-injected) was extracted 3 h after injection using TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Centre, Inc.). Three independent biological replicates from different mosquito generations were performed. Reverse transcription was achieved using the RevertAidTM H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene transcript levels were quantified using Fast SYBR Green® master mix (ABI) in an ABI 7500 Fast Real-time PCR machine. Primers are detailed in supplemental Table S2. The housekeeping gene RPL19 was used to normalize transcript levels, and expression levels in dsLacZ-injected mosquitoes were compared with non-injected controls. To determine a correlation between results obtained by qRT-PCR and by microarray, we conducted a linear regression analysis. The p value reported for the regression equation represents the result of the test that estimates the null hypothesis of the slope as being equal to zero, whereas the p value reported after the coefficient of correlation tests for the significance of the correlation coefficient. To quantify the transcript levels of AGAP009100 (TGase1), AGAP009098 (TGase2), TEP1, APL1C, LRIM1, and CTL4 (supplemental Table S2) at different time points (1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 h) after dsLacZ and dsFos injection, we used qRT-PCR. Three independent biological experiments were conducted. Fold change after injection of dsLacZ and dsFos was calculated relative to non-injected controls. A two-way analysis of covariance was applied to determine the statistical significance of the effects of dsRNA treatment and time on transcript abundance. The t test was used to identify significant differences in expression levels between control (dsLacZ) and dsFos-injected mosquitoes for each time point separately. To verify the efficiency of TEP1, TGase1, TGase2, and Fos knockdown, we used qRT-PCR as described above. RNA was extracted from 10 mosquitoes 4 days after injection of dsRNA, reverse-transcribed, and amplified using primers described in supplemental Table S2. Three independent experiments were performed, and expression levels were normalized to RPL19 expression. Hemolymph of 15 dsRNA-treated females was collected 3–4 days after injection into a Laemmli protein-loading buffer by proboscis clipping. Hemolymph samples were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked by incubation in a 5% milk powder solution for 1 h; rinsed in PBS, 1% Triton X-100; and incubated either with rabbit anti-TEP1 (1:500) or with anti-prophenoloxidase (1:15,000) antibody solutions for 1 h. After PBS washes, the membrane was incubated in a 5% milk powder PBS solution containing a secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:15,000) tagged with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to reveal the blot. Mosquito infections were carried out in 2007 and in 2010 at OCEAC with the P. falciparum gametocytes collected from the blood of children (5–11 years old) who attended schools in the area of Mfou (3°40 north; 11°35 east), a small city 30 km from Yaoundé. Parasites were detected by Giemsa-stained thick blood smears. Children showing asexual parasitemia were treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy according to national guidelines. Asymptomatic gametocyte-positive children were enrolled as volunteers upon signing of an informed consent form by their legal guardian. The recruitment procedures and experimental protocols were approved by the Cameroonian ethical review committee. For each volunteer, 4 ml of venous blood were collected by venipuncture in heparinized Vacutainer tubes and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 37 °C. The supernatant, containing serum, was replaced by non-immune AB serum to limit transmission-interfering factors (37Boudin C. Diop A. Gaye A. Gadiaga L. Gouagna C. Safeukui I. Bonnet S. Plasmodium falciparum transmission blocking immunity in three areas with perennial or seasonal endemicity and different levels of transmission.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2005; 73: 1090-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The mixture (350 ml) was dispensed into prewarmed glass feeders, on which mosquitoes previously starved for 12 h were allowed to feed for 30 min through a parafilm membrane. Well-fed mosquitoes were maintained in the insectary at 28 °C. After 7 days, midguts were dissected, stained with a 0.4% mercurochrome solution, and examined under light microscopy (×200) for oocyst counts. Significance of differences in oocyst numbers (only for samples with at least one oocyst per midgut) and in prevalence of infection was assessed by computing the standardized mean differences and the odds ratio, respectively, under random effect models using comprehensive meta-analysis software (38Borenstein M.

https://openalex.org/W2034625176,"The bacterial effector protein cycle inhibiting factor (CIF) converts glutamine 40 of NEDD8 to glutamate (Q40E), causing cytopathic effects and inhibiting cell proliferation. Although these have been attributed to blocking the functions of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, how CIF modulates NEDD8-dependent signaling is unclear. Here we use conditional NEDD8-dependent yeast to explore the effects of CIF on cullin neddylation. Although CIF causes cullin deneddylation and the generation of free NEDD8 Q40E, inhibiting the COP9 signalosome (CSN) allows Q40E to form only on NEDD8 attached to cullins. In the presence of the CSN, NEDD8 Q40E is removed from cullins more rapidly than NEDD8, leading to a decrease in steady-state cullin neddylation. As NEDD8 Q40E is competent for cullin conjugation in the absence of functional CSN and with overexpression of the NEDD8 ligase Dcn1, our data are consistent with NEDD8 deamidation causing enhanced deneddylation of cullins by the CSN. This leads to a dramatic change in the extent of activated cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases."

The pathways that are stimulated in any given receptor tyrosine kinase are a function of the initial docking sites that are activated and the availability of downstream participants.

Responding to signals emanating from the extracellular environment constitutes a fundamental biological activity that allows cells to relay external information, such as changes in environment, to interior compartments and components. In multicellular organisms, this is essential to coordinate the activities of different tissues and organs within the context of the organism as a whole. The mechanism of transmission of these signals is usually through the activation of plasma membrane-bound receptors following specific binding of germane signaling entities, with the view of eventually modulating protein synthesis through the activation/deactivation of transcription factors (1Pawson T. Regulation and targets of receptor tyrosine kinases.Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: S3-S10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each receptor family has a distinct mechanism for activation and propagation of signals (2Kholodenko B.N. Cell-signalling dynamics in time and space.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), including the instigation of multiple (both number and kind) post-translational modifications. For the most part, these are characterized by transient alterations of existing proteins that regulate their function, location, or turnover, often by affecting macromolecular interactions. Many of these are catalyzed by the over 500 protein kinases (in humans) (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6217) Google Scholar), producing a plethora of phosphorylations on tyrosine, threonine, and serine residues of a vast array of intracellular proteins. Indeed, these modifications have been shown to be very extensive (4Choudhary C. Olsen J.V. Brandts C. Cox J. Reddy P.N. Böhmer F.D. Gerke V. Schmidt-Arras D.E. Berdel W.E. Müller-Tidow C. Mann M.

However, it is also clear that the complete description of this type of modification in any cell type under any condition has certainly not been elucidated. One of the reasons that protein phosphorylation has been studied so extensively is the fact that one receptor class, the so-called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), 3The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PTR, PDGF receptor-TrkA chimeric receptor; PC12c, control PC12 cells unstimulated; PTRu, transfected PC12 cells unstimulated; PTRs, transfected PC12 cells stimulated; PTR Y490F(s), transfected PC12 cells with PTR Y490F stimulated; PTM, post-translational modification; SILAC, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture; DAG, diacylglycerol; ACN, acetonitrile. plays a central role in a very broad range of cellular responses and is heavily implicated in a spectrum of human pathologies, notably cancer (7Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Receptor tyrosine kinases as targets for anticancer drugs.Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Krause D.S. Van Etten R.A. Tyrosine kinases as targets for cancer therapy.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The RTK family consists of 19 different subfamilies containing a total of 58 members (9Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Oncogenic kinase signalling.Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). The protomers are characterized by the presence of an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and assemble into higher oligomeric forms that, when activated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain, catalyze the trans-autophosphorylation of a number of tyrosine residues found in the kinase domain itself or in its N- or C-terminal flanking sequences. These can serve as docking sites for a variety of adaptor/effector/scaffold proteins, which are similarly modified in turn, leading to the propagation and amplification of the signal. There is a limited subset of such proteins, and there is considerable overlap in the pathways that are activated by the various RTK families. However, there is quite a bit of variation in the binding profiles of each family and, hence to some degree, on the downstream phosphoproteome thus produced. For example, the EGF receptor has a large (∼200 residues) C-terminal extension beyond the kinase, which contributes most of its phosphotyrosine-docking sites, and there is considerable redundancy in the entities bound (10Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar, 11Tyson D.R. Larkin S. Hamai Y. Bradshaw R.A. PC12 cell activation by epidermal growth factor receptor: role of autophosphorylation sites.Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2003; 21: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), although the FGF receptor family has its many fewer phosphorylated tyrosines located mostly in the kinase domain itself and does not apparently bind effector/adaptor molecules through these sites (12Foehr E.D. Raffioni S. Murray-Rust J. Bradshaw R.A. The role of tyrosine residues in fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 signaling in PC12 cells. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis in the endodomain.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37529-37536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Of course, all of the RTK family has tyrosine residues in the activation loop that become phosphorylated, and these are essential for signaling in every case except the EGF receptor (13Gotoh N. Tojo A. Hino M. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. A highly conserved tyrosine residue at codon 845 within the kinase domain is not required for the transforming activity of human epidermal growth factor receptor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). TrkA, the receptor for NGF, has in addition to the activation loop tyrosines (Tyr-670, Tyr-674, and Tyr-675) two other principal sites, Tyr-490 and Tyr-785, both of which lie outside of the kinase domain. These provide docking sites that can lead to the stimulation of several signaling pathways. For example, the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK or ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways have been shown to be associated with Tyr-490, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) pathway is associated with Tyr-785 (14Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuronal differentiation signals are controlled by nerve growth factor receptor/Trk binding sites for SHC and PLCγ.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, no detailed analysis of the downstream TrkA phosphorylations specifically tied to Tyr-490 or Tyr-785 has been reported. In this study, chimeric receptors composed of the ectodomain of the human PDGF receptor and the transmembrane and endodomain of the TrkA receptor from rat (denoted PTR), in which Tyr-490 or Tyr-490/785 were changed to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis, were stably transfected into PC12 cells (14Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuronal differentiation signals are controlled by nerve growth factor receptor/Trk binding sites for SHC and PLCγ.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and the phosphoproteomes, determined after 20 min of stimulation, were compared with that of the activated wild-type PTR receptor and unstimulated cells (15Biarc J. Chalkley R.J. Burlingame A.L. Bradshaw R.A. The induction of serine/threonine protein phosphorylations by a PDGFR/TrkA chimera in stably transfected PC12 cells.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11: 15-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of PDGF receptors in PC12 cells, the chimeric construction avoids any contributions from other receptors, including the exogenous Trk receptors and the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75, which also uses NGF as a ligand. The phosphopeptides that were observed to significantly increase or decrease across a comparison of all four samples indicate those events dependent on Tyr-490 and Tyr-785 or not dependent on either. This last group apparently arises from other, as yet unidentified, binding sites on TrkA. Cell lines stably transfected with the chimeric receptors PTR, PTR Y490F, and PTR Y490F/Y785F were generated as described previously (14Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuronal differentiation signals are controlled by nerve growth factor receptor/Trk binding sites for SHC and PLCγ.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Briefly, an EcoRII/MseI restriction fragment containing the cDNA sequence for the human βPDGF-R extracellular domain fused to a cDNA sequence coding for the transmembrane and intracellular domains of rat TrkA was cloned into the retroviral vector pLEN. Ecotropic retroviruses were generated with the help of PA317, GP+E-86 PTR, and PTR Y490F producer cell lines. In the case of PTR Y490F/Y785F, 15 μg of the construction (cloned into p-Babe-puro plasmid given by E. Gonzalez-Munoz and C. Petritsch) were transfected into Phoenix packaging cells (PTR Y490F/Y785F) using polyethyleneimine. After 48 h, viruses were collected, concentrated, and incubated with PC12 cells. After 8 days, puromycin was added to the culture medium at 0.5 μg/ml. All PCR-derived sequences were completely resequenced to exclude any PCR errors. The level of expression of PTR receptors used in these studies was not directly measured, but indirect measures of activity following stimulation indicated that the levels were comparable with native expression, based on comparison with clones that had been analyzed. PC12 cells, with or without the stably transfected chimeric receptor PTR, PTR Y490F, and PTR Y490F/Y785F, were grown in 15-cm Petri dishes in light medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% horse serum, 5% calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), and 200 mg/liter l-proline (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). After starving the cells for 24 h, the cells were stimulated for 20 min with PDGF-BB (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA) (50 ng/ml) and lysed in 10 ml of TRIzol® reagent. Proteins were purified according to the TRIzol® reagent protocol and resuspended in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. After centrifugation (5 min, 4 °C at 14,000 × g), an aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed by the Bradford test to measure the concentration of protein in each sample. For SILAC, PC12 cells stably transfected with the chimeric receptor PTR were grown in DMEM deficient in normal arginine and lysine and supplemented with 15% dialyzed FBS (Hyclone®, Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin and streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), 200 mg/liter l-proline (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and l-arginine-13C6-15N4·HCl and l-lysine-13C6-15N2·HCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific and Sigma, respectively). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator with 5% atmospheric CO2 at 37 °C for at least six passages to obtain 100% incorporation of the isotopically labeled amino acids. The incorporation level was determined after each cell passage by checking for the presence of the light version of each peptide identified when running only the heavy sample. There was no evidence for any unlabeled peptides in the sample used as reference for these studies. After starvation for 24 h, seven Petri dishes of cells were stimulated 20 min with PDGF (50 μg/ml) in the same way as the light samples and lysed in TRIzol® reagent. Proteins from the seven dishes were each suspended in 700 μl of 6 m guanidine·HCl. This sample constituted the “heavy standard” used for quantification. To measure the neurite outgrowth, PC12 cells and PC12 cells stably transfected with PTR or PTR mutants were cultivated on 5 μg/cm2 rat tail collagen I (BD Biosciences) and stimulated for 3 days with NGF or PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml). Three mg of sample from each mutant PTR transfected and stimulated cell line were mixed with 3 mg of the heavy standard. Each sample was reduced for 1 h at 57 °C with 2.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride to reduce cysteine side chains and alkylated with 4.2 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 45 min at 21 °C. Proteins were digested using 2% (w/w) modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 1 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptides were desalted on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge® (Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The peptides were vacuum-dried and resuspended in 750 μl of 35% ACN, 200 mm NaCl, 0.4% TFA for phosphopeptide enrichment. Peptides were enriched using 5 μm of titanium dioxide beads (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) (23Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar, 24Malik S. Roeder R.G. Dynamic regulation of pol II transcription by the mammalian Mediator complex.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) packed into an analytical guard column with a 62-μl packing volume (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA). Peptides were passed over the titanium dioxide column with 4.4 ml of loading buffer B1 (35% ACN, ,200 mm NaCl, 0.4% TFA) followed by 6.5 ml of wash buffer A1 (5% ACN, 0.1% TFA). The nonphosphorylated peptides were collected during the first step. Phosphorylated peptides were then eluted from the titanium dioxide column directly onto a C18 MacroTrap peptide column (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) using 15 ml of elution buffer A2 (1 m KH2PO4). The C18 column was washed with 17.1 ml of wash buffer A1, and the peptides were eluted using 500 μl of organic elution buffer B2 (50% ACN, 0.1% TFA). This collected fraction was lyophilized to dryness. Three separations were performed for each sample (2 mg/run). Strong cation exchange chromatography was performed using an ÄKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) equipped with a Tricorn 5/200 column (GE Healthcare) packed in house with 5 μm of 300 Å of polysulfoethyl A resin (Western Analytical, Lake Elsinore, CA). Phosphopeptides enriched from each sample were loaded onto the column in 30% ACN, 5 mm KH2PO4, pH 2.7 (buffer A). Buffer B consisted of buffer A with 350 mm KCl. The gradient went from 1% B to 72% B over 16.5 ml, from 72% B to 100% B over 1.5 ml, and from 100% B to 1% B over 2 ml at a flow rate of 0.350 ml/min. Fractions (53 and 30) were collected of the phosphopeptides and the nonphosphopeptides, respectively, and were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore), dried down, and resuspended in 25 μl of water, 0.1% formic acid. A quarter of each fraction was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Mass spectrometry was performed using an LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatography was performed using a NanoAcquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography system (Waters) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min on a column of BEH130 C18 75 μm inner diameter × 150 mm (Waters), with a 90-min gradient. Solvent A was water, 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; peptides were eluted by a gradient from 2 to 28% solvent B over 70 min followed by a short wash at 50% solvent B, before returning to the starting conditions. Peptide components eluted over a period of ∼60 min during these runs. After a precursor scan of intact peptides was measured in the orbitrap by scanning from m/z 350 −1,800 (with a resolution of 60,000), the seven most intense multiply charged precursors were selected for collision-induced dissociation analysis in the linear ion trap. Activation times were 30 ms for collision-induced dissociation fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 35.0. Automatic gain control targets were 100,000 ions for orbitrap scans and 10,000 for MS/MS scans. Dynamic exclusion for 60 s was used to reduce repeated analysis of the same components. Fragmentation data were converted to peak lists using an in-house script based on the Raw_Extract script in Xcalibur version 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the collision-induced dissociation data for each sample were searched using Protein Prospector version 5.8 (16Chalkley R.J. Baker P.R. Medzihradszky K.F. Lynn A.J. Burlingame A.L. In-depth analysis of tandem mass spectrometry data from disparate instrument types.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 2386-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in two separate searches against the UniProt rodent database (downloaded June 6, 2010, with a total of 44,512 entries), to which a randomized version of all entries had been concatenated. Both searches used the following parameters: mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS modes were 30 ppm and 0.6 daltons, respectively. Trypsin was designated as the enzyme, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. S-Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was designated as a fixed modification. Variable modifications considered were N-terminal acetylation, N-terminal glutamine conversion to pyroglutamate, methionine oxidation, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues. In the second search, the same parameters were employed but with heavy arginine and lysine residues considered as fixed modifications. The two searches were then merged into a single result file. The maximum expectation value allowed was set up at 0.01 (protein) and 0.05 (peptide). At these thresholds, the peptide false-positive rate was estimated to be 0.5% for each SILAC experiment according to concatenated database search results (17Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. Target-decoy search strategy for increased confidence in large-scale protein identifications by mass spectrometry.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2827) Google Scholar); the protein false-positive rate was estimated to be 3.5%. As the proteins reported in this study are only those identified in all SILAC experiments, and the incorrect identifications are probably only identified in a single experiment, the actual false discovery rate is likely to be lower than this estimate. The reliability of phosphorylation site assignments was measured using the site localization in peptide score in Protein Prospector (18Baker P.R. Trinidad J.C. Chalkley R.J. Modification site localization scoring integrated into a search engine.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SILAC quantification measurements were extracted from the raw data by Search Compare in Protein Prospector. 4P. R. Baker, N. J. Agard, A. L. Burlingame, and R. J. Chalkley, poster presented at 58th ASMS Conference of Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Salt Lake City, UT (May 23–27, 2010). Search Compare averaged together MS scans from −10 s to +30 s from the time at which the MS/MS spectrum was acquired to produce measurements averaged over the elution of the peptide. Search Compare calculates a noise level in the averaged spectrum. Only peaks with a signal to noise of greater than 10 were used in quantification measurements. If one of the SILAC pair is above this threshold and the other is below, then the ratio is reported with a > or < (see supplemental Tables), indicating one value was below the noise level, so the ratio reported is a minimum estimate. If a phosphopeptide was identified from multiple MSMS spectra, the median of the calculated SILAC ratios from all the replicate identifications of the same peptide was reported. These ratios were then corrected for differences in protein level using data from the nonphosphorylated peptides (where SILAC ratios should be 1:1). The protein ratio for practically all proteins was the same between samples, as 20 min of stimulation is not long enough to instigate measurable changes in protein expression levels. The average of the standard deviation of the log(ratios) for each peptide was 0.08. Three times this standard deviation should include 99.7% of the data according to a Gaussian distribution, so a greater than 1.8-fold difference (0.25 = log(1.8)) should correspond to a significant change and a less than a 1.3-fold difference (0.125 = log(1.3)) should not be considered as significant. The frequency of occurrence of different kinase motifs within the phosphorylation sites identified as a whole, and those that were regulated by stimulation of different receptor versions were characterized. The queried kinase motifs were from those reported in the Human Protein Reference Database phosphorylation database (19Amanchy R. Periaswamy B. Mathivanan S. Reddy R. Tattikota S.G. Pandey A. A curated compendium of phosphorylation motifs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 285-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The frequency of occurrence of different motifs in the database were determined using MS-Pattern (20Chalkley R.J. Hansen K.C. Baldwin M.A. Bioinformatic methods to exploit mass spectrometric data for proteomic applications.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 402: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as described previously (15Biarc J.

Twelve μg of PC12c, PTRu, PTRs, PTR Y490Fu, PTR Y490s, PTR Y490/785Fu, and PTR Y490/785s (treated as described above) were separated on a 4–20% Tris-HCl ready gel (Bio-Rad)) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Polyscreen®). The blocking step was performed using 5% BSA in TBS, 0.5% Tween 20 buffer for 1 h. The first antibody was used at 1:1,000 dilution for 1 h followed by three washes of 5 min each in TBS, 0.5% Tween 20 buffer. The secondary antibody coupled to HRP (Bio-Rad) was incubated for 30 min. After three washes of 5 min with TBS, 0.5% Tween 20, the substrate ECL-plus (GE Healthcare) was added to the membrane and the detection performed. In previously reported experiments (15Biarc J.

In this study, the phosphoproteomes of mutant PTR Y490F and PTR Y490F/Y785F (Fig. 1), also in stably transfected cells, have been determined under the same conditions and compared with those of the native receptor (PTR). The phenotypic response of both of these mutants to ligand stimulation was disrupted and generally resulted in incomplete differentiation, albeit that the double mutant was more severely compromised. The wild-type receptor yielded neurite outgrowth characteristic of the stimulation of PC12 cells by NGF through TrkA, although the mutant Y490F showed a decreased response, and the double mutant Y490F/Y785F was not able to significantly extend neurites at all.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contain both TRIC subtypes and two Ca2+ release mechanisms; incidental opening of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) generates local Ca2+ sparks to induce hyperpolarization and relaxation, whereas agonist-induced activation of inositol trisphosphate receptors produces global Ca2+ transients causing contraction. Tric-a knock-out mice develop hypertension due to insufficient RyR-mediated Ca2+ sparks in VSMCs. Here we describe transgenic mice overexpressing TRIC-A channels under the control of a smooth muscle cell-specific promoter. The transgenic mice developed congenital hypotension. In Tric-a-overexpressing VSMCs from the transgenic mice, the resting membrane potential decreased because RyR-mediated Ca2+ sparks were facilitated and cell surface Ca2+-dependent K+ channels were hyperactivated. Under such hyperpolarized conditions, L-type Ca2+ channels were inactivated, and thus, the resting intracellular Ca2+ levels were reduced in Tric-a-overexpressing VSMCs. Moreover, Tric-a overexpression impaired inositol trisphosphate-sensitive stores to diminish agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling in VSMCs. These altered features likely reduced vascular tonus leading to the hypotensive phenotype.

Two major classes of intracellular Ca2+ channels, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) 3The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor; BK channel, big-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channel; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PE, phenylephrine; RyR, ryanodine receptor; STOC, spontaneous transient outward current; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SMC, smooth muscle cell; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell. and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), provide the fundamental pathway for Ca2+ release from internal stores into the cytoplasm (1Bezprozvanny I.

IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive stores in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) plays a central role in cellular signaling systems. RyR-mediated Ca2+ release from caffeine-sensitive stores also regulates important cellular functions such as excitation-contraction coupling, secretion/exocytosis, and gene expression, primarily in excitable cells. When the divalent cation Ca2+ is released from the SR/ER, a negative potential is likely generated on the luminal side and may inhibit subsequent Ca2+ release. Therefore, counterion movements may balance SR/ER membrane potential to establish efficient Ca2+ release mechanisms in various cell types (5Somlyo A.V. Gonzalez-Serratos H.G. Shuman H. McClellan G.

Indeed, previous electrophysiological and fluorometric analyses detected several ionic currents, such as K+, Cl−, and H+ fluxes, across the SR/ER membrane (7Coronado R. Miller C.

However, the channel/transporter components mediating such ionic flows have not been identified, and thus, their contributions to the proposed counterion movements are largely unknown. Recently, we identified two TRIC (trimeric intracellular cation) channel subtypes, TRIC-A and TRIC-B, that assemble into bullet-shaped homotrimers to form monovalent cation-selective channels in the SR/ER and nuclear membranes (11Venturi E.

Double-knock-out mice lacking both the Tric-a and Tric-b genes show embryonic cardiac failure, and the mutant cardiomyocytes display weak RyR-mediated Ca2+ release from the SR (14Yazawa M.

Tric-a knock-out mice develop hypertension associated with vascular hypertonicity, and the mutant vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) show insufficient Ca2+ sparks for inducing hyperpolarization (15Yamazaki D.

Moreover, mutant skeletal muscle from Tric-a knock-out mice occasionally exhibits alternan contraction responses, likely due to destabilized RyR-mediated Ca2+ release (16Zhao X. Yamazaki D. Park K.-H. Komazaki S. Tjondrokoesoemo A. Nishi M. Lin P. Hirata Y. Brotto M. Takeshima H. Ma J. Ca2+ overload and sarcoplasmic reticulum instability in tric-a null skeletal muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37370-37376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tric-b knock-out mice develop respiratory failure at birth, and the mutant alveolar epithelial cells exhibit compromised IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release and insufficient handling of surfactant lipids (17Yamazaki D. Komazaki S. Nakanishi H. Mishima A. Nishi M. Yazawa M. Yamazaki T. Taguchi R. Takeshima H.

These defects observed in the knock-out mice support our hypothesis that TRIC channel subtypes partly mediate counterion movements to facilitate SR/ER Ca2+ release. VSMCs possess both caffeine- and IP3-sensitive stores and also contain both TRIC-A and TRIC-B channels. Therefore, VSMCs are an ideal model system to examine the physiological functions of TRIC channel subtypes. We recently detected not only insufficient RyR-mediated Ca2+ sparks but also facilitated IP3R-mediated Ca2+ transients in Tric-a knock-out VSMCs (15Yamazaki D. Tabara Y. Kita S. Hanada H. Komazaki S. Naitou D. Mishima A. Nishi M. Yamamura H. Yamamoto S. Kakizawa S. Miyachi H. Yamamoto S. Miyata T. Kawano Y. Kamide K. Ogihara T. Hata A. Umemura S. Soma M. Takahashi N. Imaizumi Y. Miki T.

TRIC-A channels in vascular smooth muscle contribute to blood pressure maintenance.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that TRIC-A channels preferentially support RyR-mediated Ca2+ release and also regulate Ca2+ distribution between the caffeine- and IP3-sensitive stores. To further verify this hypothesis, we planned to generate mutant mice carrying the SMC-specific Tric-a transgene and to examine altered features in Tric-a-overexpressing VSMCs. Transgenic mice overexpressing TRIC-A channels under the control of the human α-smooth muscle actin promoter were generated and genotyped as previously described (15Yamazaki D. Tabara Y. Kita S. Hanada H. Komazaki S. Naitou D. Mishima A. Nishi M. Yamamura H. Yamamoto S. Kakizawa S. Miyachi H. Yamamoto S. Miyata T. Kawano Y. Kamide K. Ogihara T. Hata A. Umemura S. Soma M. Takahashi N.

The transgenic and wild-type littermates (8–12 weeks old) were examined physiologically and biochemically in this study. All experiments were conducted with the approval of the Animal Research Committee at Kyoto University according to the regulations on animal experimentation at Kyoto University. To telemetrically monitor arterial blood pressure, PA-C10 transmitters (Data Sciences International, New Brighton, MN) were implanted into mice, and the pressure-sensing catheters were inserted into the aortic arch under anesthesia. Radio signals from the implanted transmitter were captured using the Physiotel RPC-1 receiver (Data Sciences International), and the data were stored online using the Dataquest ART data acquisition system (Data Sciences International). Blood pressure and heart rate in the conscious state were also monitored by tail-cuff plethysmography (Model BP-98A-L, Softron) during the daytime. Histological and ultrastructural analyses were carried out as described previously (18Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Junctophilins. A novel family of junctional membrane complex proteins.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mesenteric arteries from adult mice were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. After the tissues were dehydrated and embedded in Epon, ultrathin sections (∼80 nm thick) were prepared and stained with toluidine blue for histological observation or uranyl acetate and lead citrate for electron microscopic analysis (JEM-200CX, JEOL). Single VSMCs were enzymatically isolated from mesenteric arteries and subjected to Ca2+ spark and membrane potential monitoring as described previously (15Yamazaki D. Tabara Y. Kita S. Hanada H.

Briefly, single VSMCs were seeded onto glass-bottomed dishes and incubated with 5 μm Fluo-4AM (Dojindo) in HEPES-buffered saline: 137 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 14 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH). The Ca2+ spark images with excitation at 488 nm and emission at >520 nm were captured using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy system (TE-2000U, Nikon), and the data were analyzed using the custom software Aquacosmos (Hamamatsu Photonics). For membrane potential monitoring, single VSMCs on glass-bottomed dishes were perfused with HEPES-buffered saline containing 200 nm oxonol VI (Fluka). Fluorescence images with excitation at 559 nm and emission at >606 nm were captured at a sampling rate of ∼1.6 s using a confocal microscope system (FV1000, Olympus). For monitoring intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in VSMCs, the inner surface of the artery was gently wiped with gauze to remove endothelial cells as described previously (20Iwamoto T. Kita S. Zhang J. Blaustein M.P. Arai Y. Yoshida S. Wakimoto K. Komuro I. Katsuragi T. Salt-sensitive hypertension is triggered by Ca2+ entry via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger type-1 in vascular smooth muscle.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The resulting arterial muscle segments were incubated with 5 μm Fura-PE3AM (Santa Cruz) and 0.02% cremophor EL (Sigma) and tightly fixed with fine steel pins onto a silicone rubber sheet, which was placed on a glass-bottomed dish. A CCD camera (ImagEM, Hamamatsu Photonics) mounted on the microscope (DMI 4000B, Leica) equipped with a polychromatic illumination system (MetaFluor ver7.7r3, Molecular Device) was used to capture fluorescence images with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at >510 nm at room temperature (∼23 °C). Whole-cell voltage clamp recording was carried out using the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Device) essentially as described previously (21Hotta S. Morimura K. Ohya S. Muraki K. Takeshima H. Imaizumi Y. Ryanodine receptor type 2 deficiency changes excitation-contraction coupling and membrane potential in urinary bladder smooth muscle.J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For spontaneous transient outward current (STOC) monitoring in single VSMCs, the STOC pipette solution (140 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 0.05 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH) and HEPES-buffered saline as a bathing solution were utilized. For the recording of total Ca2+-dependent K+ currents, the BK pipette solution (140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 6.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH, pCa 6.5) and HEPES-buffered saline containing 100 μm CdCl2 as a bathing solution were utilized. All physiological measurements were carried out at room temperature. The arterial muscle segments were subjected to transmembrane potential monitoring with high resistance glass microelectrodes (30–50 megaohms) filled with 3 m KCl solution as described previously (22Kiyoshi H. Yamazaki D. Ohya S. Kitsukawa M. Muraki K. Saito S.Y. Ohizumi Y. Imaizumi Y.

Membrane potential was determined as an average of the potentials obtained from stable impalements longer than 1 min from different areas in the muscle segment. The transmembrane potential was amplified by a high-input impedance amplifier with capacitance neutralization (MEZ-7200, Nihon Kohden), and the electrical signals were digitized and analyzed using a Power Lab system (AD Instruments). The bath solution used was modified Krebs solution babbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C at pH ∼ 7.4 (112 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 14 mm glucose). For quantitative PCR analysis, total RNA preparations from various tissues (at least three mice of each genotype) were used as templates for cDNA synthesis (ReverTra ACE qPCR-RT kit, Toyobo) and analyzed using a real-time PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermal Cycler TP800, Takara). The cycle threshold was determined from the cDNA amplification curve as an index for relative mRNA content in each reaction. The PCR primer sets used in this study were listed previously (15Yamazaki D. Tabara Y. Kita S. Hanada H. Komazaki S. Naitou D. Mishima A. Nishi M. Yamamura H. Yamamoto S. Kakizawa S. Miyachi H.

For immunochemical analysis, tissue lysates and fixed VSMCs were examined using primary antibodies to TRIC channel subtypes and calnexin (Santa Cruz) as described previously (14Yazawa M. Ferrante C.

Junctophilins. A novel family of junctional membrane complex proteins.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously generated transgenic mice with SMC-specific overexpression of TRIC-A channels using the α-smooth muscle actin promoter (23Nakano Y. Nishihara T. Sasayama S. Miwa T. Kamada S. Kakunaga T. Transcriptional regulatory elements in the 5′ upstream and first intron regions of the human smooth muscle (aortic type) α-actin-encoding gene.Gene. 1991; 99: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the constructed Tric-a-transgene rescues the hypertensive phenotype developed in Tric-a knock-out mice (15Yamazaki D. Tabara Y. Kita S. Hanada H. Komazaki S. Naitou D. Mishima A. Nishi M. Yamamura H. Yamamoto S. Kakizawa S. Miyachi H. Yamamoto S. Miyata T. Kawano Y. Kamide K. Ogihara T. Hata A. Umemura S. Soma M. Takahashi N. Imaizumi Y. Miki T. Iwamoto T. Takeshima H. TRIC-A channels in vascular smooth muscle contribute to blood pressure maintenance.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the effects of the transgene have not been examined in a wild-type genetic background. Therefore, we generated two Tric-a-transgenic mouse lines in wild-type backgrounds, which we designated as TgA3 and TgA20 mice. Both transgenic mouse lines grew and reproduced normally (supplemental Fig. S1A). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the transgene was highly expressed in blood vessels and other tissues containing SMCs, and its expression was faintly detected in the liver and skeletal muscle (supplemental Fig. S1B). In accordance with our previous observation that the transgene dosage in the TgA20 mouse line is higher than in the TgA3 line (15Yamazaki D. Tabara Y. Kita S. Hanada H. Komazaki S. Naitou D. Mishima A. Nishi M. Yamamura H. Yamamoto S. Kakizawa S. Miyachi H. Yamamoto S. Miyata T. Kawano Y. Kamide K. Ogihara T. Hata A. Umemura S. Soma M. Takahashi N. Imaizumi Y. Miki T. Iwamoto T. Takeshima H. TRIC-A channels in vascular smooth muscle contribute to blood pressure maintenance.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), TgA20 mice showed higher transgene expression in SMC-containing tissues than TgA3 mice in RT-PCR analysis (supplemental Fig. S1C). By telemetric blood pressure monitoring, both TgA20 and TgA3 mice, even at a young-adult age, showed low blood pressure levels throughout the entire day (Fig. 1A). This hypotensive phenotype was further confirmed by tail-cuff monitoring (Fig. 1B). Most likely reflecting the difference in transgene expression between the mouse lines, TgA20 mice developed slightly lower blood pressure than TgA3 mice. Elevated blood pressure stimulates the baroreceptor reflex and effectively decreases heart rate in normal animals (24Smith O.A. Reflex and central mechanisms involved in the control of the heart and circulation.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1974; 36: 93-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in both transgenic mice, a slow heart rate was clearly observed under hypotensive conditions. The blockage of cardiac autonomic controls by coapplication of the muscarinic blocker atropine and the β-adrenoreceptor blocker metoprolol ameliorated the bradycardic phenotype, whereas low blood pressure was clearly maintained in the transgenic mice (Fig. 1B). Therefore, ectopic Tric-a expression in baroreceptors and/or autonomic neurons likely produced vagal-dominant states in both transgenic mice. Moreover, the α1-adrenoreceptor blocker prazosin induced similar vasodilating effects in both wild-type and transgenic mice (supplemental Fig. S1E). These observations suggest that impaired sympathetic stimuli to the heart and vascular smooth muscle were not significant contributors to hypotension in the transgenic mice. It may be reasonable that altered vascular functions underlie the hypotensive phenotype in both transgenic mice because Tric-a knock-out mice develop hypertension due to increased vascular tonus (15Yamazaki D. Tabara Y. Kita S. Hanada H. Komazaki S. Naitou D. Mishima A. Nishi M. Yamamura H. Yamamoto S. Kakizawa S. Miyachi H. Yamamoto S. Miyata T. Kawano Y. Kamide K. Ogihara T. Hata A. Umemura S. Soma M.

TRIC-A channels in vascular smooth muscle contribute to blood pressure maintenance.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Resistance arteries distributed to peripheral tissues are primarily responsible for blood pressure maintenance. The mesenteric artery is a typical resistance vessel and was examined in our studies below. By RT-PCR analysis of mesenteric arteries, the Tric-a mRNA levels in TgA20 and TgA3 mice were at least 400-fold greater than those of wild-type controls (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis confirmed Tric-a overexpression, and enhanced immunoreactivities provided estimates that the TRIC-A protein levels in the arteries from the transgenic mice were increased more than 500-fold compared with wild-type arteries (Fig. 2B). However, neither the heart nor skeletal muscle from the transgenic mice showed an obvious enhancement of TRIC-A immunoreactivity (supplemental Fig. S1D). Such SMC-specific overexpression of TRIC-A channels may not cause serious damage to the fundamental functions of resistance arteries because the transgenic mice retained circadian blood pressure variation (Fig. 1A) and regular blood pressure fluctuation in response to typical vasodilators targeting VSMCs (supplemental Fig. S1E). Histological observations revealed no obvious abnormalities in mesenteric arteries from TgA20 and TgA3 mice (Fig. 2C). For example, under relaxation conditions after incubation in a Ca2+-free bathing solution, similar passive diameters and VSMC layer thicknesses of the arteries were observed in the transgenic and wild-type mice (supplemental Fig. S2A). These observations suggest that the hypotensive phenotype was mainly caused by insufficient myogenic tonus of resistance arteries under in vivo conditions in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopic observation detected irregular membranous ultrastructures in mesenteric arteries from the transgenic mice. In Tric-a-overexpressing VSMCs, stacked rough ER elements accumulated around cell-interior regions (Fig. 2D, left panels). The generation of stacked rough ER has been repeatedly reported in various cell types overexpressing integral SR/ER membrane proteins (25Pathak R.K. Luskey K.L. Anderson R.G.

Indeed, dense immunofluorescence signals of ectopic TRIC-A channels were predominantly observed in the cell-interior regions of VSMCs from transgenic mice (supplemental Fig. S2B), suggesting that the ER stacks were generated by nonspecific effects of excess TRIC-A protein. In SMCs, IP3Rs are distributed uniformly over the nuclear and ER/SR membranes (27Tasker P.N. Michelangeli F. Nixon G.F.

Therefore, it is possible that the formation of the stacked rough ER may have a functional impact on IP3-sensitive stores. However, such a morphological abnormality may minimally affect caffeine-sensitive stores. In VSMCs, free-floating small vesicles, originally referred to as “surface vesicles” (31Devine C.E.

Here we have examined the role of the extracellular matrix protein ameloblastin (Ambn), a recent addition to the family of non-collagenous extracellular bone matrix proteins, in craniofacial bone development and suture formation. Using RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry, Ambn was localized in mouse calvarial bone and adjacent condensed mesenchyme. Five-fold Ambn overexpression in a K14-driven transgenic mouse model resulted in delayed posterior frontal suture fusion and incomplete suture closure. Moreover, Ambn overexpressor skulls weighed 13.2% less, their interfrontal bones were 35.3% thinner, and the width between frontal bones plus interfrontal suture was 14.3% wider. Ambn overexpressing mice also featured reduced cell proliferation in suture blastemas and in mesenchymal cells from posterior frontal sutures. There was a more than 2-fold reduction of Msx2 in Ambn overexpressing calvariae and suture mesenchymal cells, and this effect was inversely proportionate to the level of Ambn overexpression in different cell lines. The reduction of Msx2 expression as a result of Ambn overexpression was further enhanced in the presence of the MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor O126. Finally, Ambn overexpression significantly reduced Msx2 down-stream target gene expression levels, including osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and Osx, the bone matrix proteins Ibsp, ColI, Ocn and Opn, and the cell cycle-related gene CcnD1. Together, these data suggest that Ambn plays a crucial role in the regulation of cranial bone growth and suture closure via Msx 2 suppression and proliferation inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2052146859,"Viral vectors are engineered virus variants able to deliver nonviral genetic information into cells, usually by the same routes as the parental viruses. For several virus families, replication-competent vectors carrying reporter genes have become invaluable tools for easy and quantitative monitoring of replication and infection, and thus also for identifying antivirals and virus susceptible cells. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), a small enveloped DNA virus causing B-type hepatitis, such vectors are not available because insertions into its tiny 3.2 kb genome almost inevitably affect essential replication elements. HBV replicates by reverse transcription of the pregenomic (pg) RNA which is also required as bicistronic mRNA for the capsid (core) protein and the reverse transcriptase (Pol); their open reading frames (ORFs) overlap by some 150 basepairs. Translation of the downstream Pol ORF does not involve a conventional internal ribosome entry site (IRES). We reasoned that duplicating the overlap region and providing artificial IRES control for translation of both Pol and an in-between inserted transgene might yield a functional tricistronic pgRNA, without interfering with envelope protein expression. As IRESs we used a 22 nucleotide element termed Rbm3 IRES to minimize genome size increase. Model plasmids confirmed its activity even in tricistronic arrangements. Analogous plasmids for complete HBV genomes carrying 399 bp and 720 bp transgenes for blasticidin resistance (BsdR) and humanized Renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) produced core and envelope proteins like wild-type HBV; while the hrGFP vector replicated poorly, the BsdR vector generated around 40% as much replicative DNA as wild-type HBV. Both vectors, however, formed enveloped virions which were infectious for HBV-susceptible HepaRG cells. Because numerous reporter and effector genes with sizes of around 500 bp or less are available, the new HBV vectors should become highly useful tools to better understand, and combat, this important pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W1518492079,"Previously, we reported that IκB kinase-β(IKKβ) phosphorylates and stabilizes TAp63γ. However, the effect of this phosphorylation on TAp63γ transcriptional activity remains unclear. In this study, we showed that overexpression of IKKβ, but not its kinase dead mutant and IKKα, can surprisingly inhibit TAp63γ transcriptional activity as measured by luciferase assays and real-time PCR analyses of p63 target genes. This inhibition was impaired by ACHP, an IKKβ inhibitor, and enhanced by TNFα that activates IKKβ. Consistently, IKKβ inhibited the binding between TAp63γ and p300, a co-activator of TAp63γ, and consequently counteracted the positive effect of p300 on TAp63γ transcriptional activity. Through phosphorylation site prediction and mass spectrometry, we identified that Ser-4 and Ser-12 of p63 are IKKβ-targeting residues. As expected, IKKβ fails to suppress the transcriptional activity of the S4A/S12A double mutant p63. These results indicate that IKKβ can suppress TAp63γ activity by interfering with the interaction between TAp63γ and p300."

Significance: A member of the TRP ion channel family displays a complex phosphorylation pattern with functional relevance. Ion flux across cell membranes is controlled by regulating the transition between the open and closed state of ion channels and by adjusting the number of ion channel molecules in the plasma membrane. The latter is achieved by regulation of the subcellular trafficking and turnover of ion channels and has major impact on the physiological properties of neurons. For example, regulated subcellular translocation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to synapses and NMDA receptor trafficking underlie the formation of long term potentiation and long term depression required for learning-related synaptic plasticity (1Lau C.G.

Both gating and subcellular translocation of ion channels may be regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation, which often occurs in a complex pattern. For example, in the major delayed rectifier potassium channel Kv2.1 a mass spectrometry analysis identified 16 phosphorylation sites, a subset of which influences voltage-dependent gating of this channel (4Park K.S. Mohapatra D.P. Misonou H. Trimmer J.S. Graded regulation of the Kv2.1 potassium channel by variable phosphorylation.Science. 2006; 313: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For another potassium channel, Kv1.2, a trafficking-dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites has been shown to regulate cell surface expression of the channel (5Yang J.W. Vacher H. Park K.S. Clark E. Trimmer J.S. Trafficking-dependent phosphorylation of Kv1.2 regulates voltage-gated potassium channel cell surface expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) 2The abbreviations used are: TRP, transient receptor potential; TRPL, TRP-like; ERG, electroretinogram; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. channels, which are widely expressed in the animal kingdom and constitute a heterogeneous family of calcium permeable cation channels, also display protein phosphorylation (6Yao X. Kwan H.Y. Huang Y. Regulation of TRP channels by phosphorylation.Neurosignals. 2005; 14: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TRP channels contain six transmembrane domains and cytosolic N and C termini. The founding member of the TRP protein family, the Drosophila TRP channel, together with its homolog TRPL (TRP-like) is expressed in photoreceptor cells of the fly compound eye and generates the receptor potential in the visual transduction cascade (7Hardie R.C.

A mass spectrometry analysis of posttranslational TRP modifications identified 21 phosphorylation sites (10Voolstra O. Beck K. Oberegelsbacher C. Pfannstiel J. Huber A. Light-dependent phosphorylation of the Drosophila transient receptor potential ion channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14275-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One of the light-dependent phosphorylation sites of TRP, Ser-982, was shown to be critical for the proper deactivation of the photoresponse (11Popescu D.C. Ham A.J. Shieh B.H. Scaffolding protein INAD regulates deactivation of vision by promoting phosphorylation of transient receptor potential by eye protein kinase C in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8570-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas the physiological function of the other phosphorylation sites is still elusive. In contrast to TRP, TRPL undergoes subcellular trafficking in a light-dependent manner (12Bähner M. Frechter S. Da Silva N. Minke B. Paulsen R. Huber A. Light-regulated subcellular translocation of Drosophila TRPL channels induces long term adaptation and modifies the light-induced current.Neuron. 2002; 34: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the dark, TRPL is located in the light-absorbing photoreceptor compartment, which is a microvillar structure in the apical portion of fly photoreceptor cells referred to as rhabdomere. Upon illumination, TRPL is first transported to the base of the rhabdomere within 5–10 min and then becomes internalized to a yet unknown intracellular compartment in the cell body via Rab5- and RabX4-dependent vesicle transport within several hours (13Cronin M.A. Lieu M.H.

Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unlike rhodopsin, which is degraded in the lysosome after its light-triggered internalization, TRPL does not enter the lysosomal pathway but is stored in the cell body and redistributed to the rhabdomere when the flies are transferred from light to darkness (12Bähner M. Frechter S. Da Silva N. Minke B. Paulsen R. Huber A.

Vallejos M.J. Michael E. Tsunoda S. Mechanisms underlying stage-1 TRPL channel translocation in Drosophila photoreceptors.PLoS. One. 2012; 7: e31622Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Internalization of TRPL depends on a functional phototransduction cascade and is triggered by calcium influx through the TRP channel (16Meyer N.E. Joel-Almagor T. Frechter S. Minke B. Huber A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 34234-34243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hence, in mutants with severe defects in the phototransduction cascade or in the absence of TRP, TRPL fails to translocate from the rhabdomere to the cell body upon illumination. In the present study we used mass spectrometry and identified nine phosphorylation sites in the TRPL protein, one located near the N terminus of the protein and eight located in the C-terminal region of the channel. The phosphorylation pattern of these sites changed upon prolonged light or dark adaptation. We mutated the eight C-terminal phosphorylation sites or subsets of these phosphorylation sites and expressed the mutated channels in photoreceptor cells of transgenic Drosophila. Mutation of the eight C-terminal phosphorylation sites resulted in mislocalization and loss of TRPL protein from the rhabdomere of dark-adapted flies. We propose a model in which the subcellular translocation of TRPL is associated with different phosphorylation states that regulate TRPL retention in the rhabdomeres and prevent its degradation.

The Theory and Practice of Drosophila Genetics.in: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 3-21Google Scholar). Flies were raised at 25 °C on standard cornmeal food and used at an age of 3–5 days after eclosion for all experiments. For determining light-dependent ion channel translocation, flies were kept in the dark for 4–5 days and were then illuminated with orange light (acrylic glass cut off filter transmitting light >560 nm, ∼200 Lux) for 16 h. Dark-raised flies were dissected under dim red light (Schott RG 630, cold light source KL1500, Schott), whereas light-raised flies were dissected under white light. For mutagenesis of phosphorylation sites, a fragment containing the C-terminal region and part of the linker sequence between TRPL and eGFP (amino acids 546–1130) was PCR-amplified from the TRPL-eGFP construct generated by Meyer et al. (16Meyer N.E. Joel-Almagor T. Frechter S. Minke B. Huber A.

Mutagenesis was performed in pBluescript II SK using the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The mutated fragments were re-inserted in the pENTR-TRPL-eGFP vector using AvrII and AgeI restriction sites. For generation of the TRPL8x-construct without eGFP tag, the TRPL8x-eGFP construct in the pENTR vector was used as a template for PCR amplification of the C-terminal region. The 3′-primer was modified to reconstitute the original TRPL stop codon and to introduce a NotI restriction site. After AvrII/NotI digestion, the TRPL8x C-terminal fragment was cloned into pENTR-TRPL-eGFP vector, thereby exchanging the C-terminal region and the eGFP tag with the mutated TRPL-C terminus of TRPL8x. Using the Gateway system (Invitrogen), the mutagenized TRPL constructs in pENTR vector were recombined with a modified pYC4 vector containing a DEST cassette between the rhodopsin 1 minimal promoter (base pairs −833 to +67) and the 3′ untranslated region of rhodopsin (17Richter D.

For normalization, the values obtained for TRPL were divided by the anti-β-tubulin values of the same sample. Mass spectrometry and data analysis was performed as described before (10Voolstra O. Beck K. Oberegelsbacher C. Pfannstiel J. Huber A. Light-dependent phosphorylation of the Drosophila transient receptor potential ion channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14275-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), except that a longer gradient (90 min) was used for peptide elution from the HPLC column, survey spectra were recorded in the Orbitrap detector in the m/z range of 250 to 2000, and data-dependent tandem mass spectra were generated for the seven most abundant peptide precursors in the linear ion trap. Mascot 2.3 (Matrix Science) and Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific) search results were loaded into Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for verification. Sequence assignments and phosphorylated residues were further verified by manual inspection of the corresponding MS/MS spectra. Relative quantification of TRPL phosphorylation sites was accomplished by a label-free nano-HPLC-MS method. Five to eight independent immunoprecipitation experiments for each light quality (“light” or “dark”) were carried out, and immunoprecipitated TRPL was digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin. A second set of five independent immunoprecipitations was performed with emphasis on the C-terminal multiple-phosphorylated peptides of TRPL. Note that the triple-phosphorylated forms of this C-terminal peptide were only detected in this second sample set. This might be due to the lower amount of protein in the first set of samples and the poor ionization efficiency that multiple-phosphorylated peptides exhibit in general. Thermo raw-files of the acquired nano-LC-MS/MS runs were processed and analyzed using Progenesis LC-MS software (Version 3.1.4, Nonlinear Dynamics). The LC-MS runs in each dataset were automatically aligned using one LC-MS run as reference. Two-dimensional maps (m/z versus retention time) of each run were generated, aligned to the reference run, and used to find a common set of feature outlines (signals defined by m/z ratio and retention time). Peptide abundance values were subsequently calculated as the sum of the peak areas within the isotope boundaries of the feature. Abundance values for each feature were normalized to account for different amounts of sample loading or run to run variations. The normalization process implemented in the Progenesis LC-MS software is based on the assumption that most features show no change in abundance in a given experiment. The software calculates for each feature a quantitative abundance ratio between the run being normalized and the reference run. The normalization factor for each run is then calculated from the distribution of the log of the abundance ratios using a recursive median approach. Further details about the calculation of peptide abundances and the normalization process in the Progenesis LC-MS software can be found at the Nonlinear homepage. Before quantification the number of features was reduced to signals with a charge state of +2, +3, +4, and +5. TRPL (phospho)peptides were identified by means of a Mascot generic file created by the Progenesis LC-MS software. For relative quantification of (phospho)peptide abundances, the mean (phospho)peptide abundances from immunoprecipitations “in the light” and “in the dark” was calculated, and the higher value was set to 100%. If more than one phosphorylation site was present on a peptide these sites were quantified together. Five immunoprecipitations per light condition were performed for the chymotryptic peptides. Tryptic peptides were derived from eight immunoprecipitations except the ones containing phosphorylated S20 and double- and triple-phosphorylated STS1114–16 (n = 5). An unpaired Student's t test was performed for statistical evaluation of the quantification results. Electroretinogram recordings were performed as previously described (14Oberegelsbacher C. Schneidler C. Voolstra O. Cerny A. Huber A. The Drosophila TRPL ion channel shares a Rab-dependent translocation pathway with rhodopsin.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For all ERG recordings, flies were light-adapted for 16 h with orange light followed by a subsequent 3-min dark adaptation before the first measurement. All ERG recordings were performed at room temperature. For quantitative analysis of the ERG recordings, oscillations were flattened using the low-pass filter at a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz. For calculating the inactivation during a 5-s orange light stimulus, the peak amplitude at the beginning of the light pulse (p) and the amplitude at the end of the light pulse (s) were determined. Inactivation was defined by the term (1− s/p) × 100% according to Wang et al. (22Wang N. Leung H.T. Pak W.L. Carl Y.T. Wadzinski B.E. Shieh B.H. Role of protein phosphatase 2A in regulating the visual signaling in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of eGFP-tagged ion channels was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy of intact eyes using water immersion as previously described (16Meyer N.E. Joel-Almagor T. Frechter S. Minke B. Huber A. Subcellular translocation of the eGFP-tagged TRPL channel in Drosophila photoreceptors requires activation of the phototransduction cascade.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Living flies were submerged in ice-chilled distilled water, and eGFP fluorescence was observed with an AxioImager.Z1m microscope (Zeiss, Germany; objective: Achroplan 20×/0.5 water immersion). For the quantification of the relative fluorescence intensities in the water immersion images, images were captured with the AxioCam MrM (Zeiss) camera and the AxioVision 4.6/4.8 (Zeiss) software. Quantification of the fluorescence in the rhabdomere of the photoreceptor cells was carried out with the original (not-processed) images and was performed with the ImageJ 1.42 software using the formula Frh = Ir/Ib, where Frh is the relative fluorescence of R1-R6, Ir is the fluorescence in the rhabdomeres of the photoreceptor cells R1-R6, and Ib is the background fluorescence of the R7/R8 rhabdomere. Microscope and camera settings were identical for all captured images except for exposure times. Exposure times were chosen individually to be as long as possible without running into pixel saturation due to overexposure. Using identical exposure times was not possible as it would have resulted either in completely black images for samples with weak fluorescence or in strong overexposure of samples with high fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence in rhabdomeres R1–6 was normalized using the fluorescence in the R7 rhabdomere. The average fluorescence was calculated from three ommatidia per eye. Five flies were analyzed for each genotype and illumination state. Localization of proteins on cryosections through Drosophila eyes was carried out as previously described (14Oberegelsbacher C. Schneidler C. Voolstra O. Cerny A. Huber A. The Drosophila TRPL ion channel shares a Rab-dependent translocation pathway with rhodopsin.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Chorna-Ornan I. Tzarfaty V. Ankri-Eliahoo G. Joel-Almagor T. Meyer N.E. Huber A. Payre F. Minke B. Light-regulated interaction of Dmoesin with TRP and TRPL channels is required for maintenance of photoreceptors.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The eGFP-tagged ion channels were visualized by their GFP fluorescence, whereas AF546-coupled phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used for labeling of the rhabdomeres. Cryosections were observed with the AxioImager.Z1m microscope using an ApoTome module (Zeiss, Germany; objective: EC Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil). All images were captured with the AxioCam MrM (Zeiss) camera and the AxioVision 4.6/4.8 (Zeiss) software. We applied mass spectrometry to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites of Drosophila TRPL in dark- and light-adapted flies. The TRPL protein was purified from protein extracts of Drosophila heads by immunoprecipitation and subsequent SDS-gel electrophoresis. The Coomassie Blue-stained TRPL band at ∼130 kDa was excised and in-gel-digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin. The resulting peptides were subjected to nano high performance liquid chromatography and tandem electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. TRPL peptides and phosphopeptides were identified by database searches. A total sequence coverage of 93.1% resulting from 75.8% sequence coverage by tryptic peptides and 91.1% sequence coverage by chymotryptic peptides was obtained (Fig. 1A). This analysis identified eight serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the cytosolic C-terminal region of TRPL (Ser-730, Ser-927, Ser-931, Thr-989, Ser-1000, Ser-1114, Thr-1115, Ser-1116) and one phosphorylation site (Ser-20) near the N terminus. Despite the high sequence coverage, no phosphorylation sites were identified in the transmembrane regions of the ion channel (Fig. 1A). Within the tryptic or chymotryptic peptides, the phosphorylated amino acids were unambiguously identified on the basis of the corresponding fragmentation spectra (LC-MS/MS analysis). A representative fragmentation spectrum for the identification of phosphorylated Ser-927 is shown in Fig. 1B. Fragmentation spectra for the other eight phosphorylation sites are included in the supplement (supplemental Fig. S1). TRPL undergoes a light-dependent subcellular translocation that may affect the phosphorylation state of TRPL. Therefore, we isolated TRPL either from dark-adapted flies, in which TRPL is located in the rhabdomere, or after 16 h of illumination with orange light, resulting in TRPL localization in the cell body (13Cronin M.A. Lieu M.H. Tsunoda S. Two stages of light-dependent TRPL-channel translocation in Drosophila photoreceptors.J. Cell Sci. 2006"
https://openalex.org/W1986888434,"Quorum-sensing systems are widely used by bacteria to control behavior in response to fluctuations in cell density. Several small diffusible molecules called autoinducers act as signaling molecules in quorum-sensing processes through interplay with sensors. Autoinducers modulate vital physiological functions such as nutrient acquisition, gene transcription, and virulence factor production. In Escherichia coli, LsrR serves as a global transcription regulator that responds to autoinducer-2 to regulate the expression of a variety of genes, including the lsr operon and the lsrR gene. Here, we report the crystal structure of full-length LsrR from E. coli, which has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain connected by a β-strand. Although only two molecules are found in one asymmetric unit, two neighboring dimers pack to form a tetramer that is consistent with the oligomerization state of LsrR in solution. Mutagenesis experiments and gel shift assays indicated that Gln-33 and Tyr-26 might be involved in interactions between LsrR and DNA. The LsrR-binding site for phosphorylated autoinducer-2 was predicted by structural comparisons of LsrR with CggR and SorC. Cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, and gel shift assays determined that phosphorylated autoinducer-2 triggered the disassembly of the LsrR tetramer into dimers and reduced the DNA binding ability of LsrR. Our findings reveal a mechanism for the change in the oligomerization state of LsrR in the presence of phosphorylated autoinducer-2. Based on these observations, we propose that phosphorylated autoinducer-2 triggers the disassembly of the LsrR tetramer to activate the transcription of its target genes.Background: The Escherichia coli global transcription regulator LsrR regulates the expression of many genes in response to autoinducer-2.Results: We determined the crystal structure of LsrR and demonstrated that phosphorylated autoinducer-2 triggers the disassembly of LsrR tetramers.Conclusion: Our findings reveal a possible mechanism for the change in the oligomerization state of LsrR.Significance: These observations may shed light on a gene transcription mechanism.

Physiological functions of bacteria such as nutrient acquisition, gene expression, motility, biofilm formation, bioluminescence, and virulence factor production are vital for survival. These functions are efficiently modulated through a process called quorum sensing (QS), 3The abbreviations used are: QS, quorum sensing; AI-2, autoinducer-2; p-AI-2, phosphorylated autoinducer-2; PDB, Protein Data Bank; DIG, digoxigenin; DBD, DNA binding domain; LBD, ligand binding domain; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; SEC, size exclusion chromatography. which is used by bacteria to communicate in response to fluctuations in cell density and species complexity (1Ng W.L. Bassler B.L. Bacterial quorum-sensing network architectures.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). QS allows for changes in bacterial behavior when the cell density reaches a critical value. For example, QS was shown to repress virulence factor production and biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae at high cell density (2Hammer B.K. Bassler B.L. Quorum sensing controls biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In Porphyromonas gingivalis, QS was reported to alter the expression of proteins involved in hemin acquisition (3Chung W.O. Park Y. Lamont R.J. McNab R. Barbieri B. Demuth D.R. Signaling system in Porphyromonas gingivalis based on a LuxS protein.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3903-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In Clostridium perfringens, QS was discovered to be important for the regulation of virulence genes (4Ohtani K. Yuan Y. Hassan S. Wang R. Wang Y. Shimizu T. Virulence gene regulation by the agr system in Clostridium perfringens.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3919-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Generally, QS bacteria use small diffusible molecules called autoinducers as communication signals. Autoinducers are produced and secreted into the external environment by QS bacteria, and they accumulate with increased cell density. When the concentration of the autoinducer reaches a minimum threshold, it is detected by QS bacteria, which responds to the signal. The result is the population-wide alteration of the gene expression profile. QS enables bacteria in a population to adopt behaviors in unison (1Ng W.L. Bassler B.L. Bacterial quorum-sensing network architectures.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 5Miller M.B. Bassler B.L. Quorum sensing in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 165-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). Several classes of autoinducers have been reported to date, among which N-acylated homoserine lactones of Gram-negative bacteria and oligopeptides of Gram-positive bacteria are the most extensively studied (6Antunes L.C. Ferreira R.B. Intercellular communication in bacteria.Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 35: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The autoinducer-2 (AI-2), whose precursor is 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione, is regarded as a “universal” signal shared by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (7Vendeville A. Winzer K. Heurlier K. Tang C.M. Hardie K.R. Making “sense” of metabolism: autoinducer-2, LuxS, and pathogenic bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 8Federle M.J. Autoinducer-2-based chemical communication in bacteria: complexities of interspecies signaling.Contrib. Microbiol. 2009; 16: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). AI-2 was originally discovered to be part of the QS pathway in V. cholerae, regulating bioluminescence (9Bassler B.L. Wright M. Silverman M.R. Multiple signalling systems controlling expression of luminescence in Vibrio harveyi: sequence and function of genes encoding a second sensory pathway.Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Subsequently, AI-2 was found to be synthesized by LuxS, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine (10Schauder S. Shokat K. Surette M.G. Bassler B.L. The LuxS family of bacterial autoinducers: biosynthesis of a novel quorum-sensing signal molecule.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Genes homologous to LuxS have been identified in many species, and AI-2 is present in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (7Vendeville A. Winzer K. Heurlier K. Tang C.M. Hardie K.R. Making “sense” of metabolism: autoinducer-2, LuxS, and pathogenic bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 8Federle M.J. Autoinducer-2-based chemical communication in bacteria: complexities of interspecies signaling.Contrib. Microbiol. 2009; 16: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The well established AI-2-based QS systems have different mechanisms of AI-2 detection and signal transduction. In Vibrio harveyi, a two-component system senses the AI-2 signal and regulates the expression of the luciferase structural operon (luxCDABE) (1Ng W.L. Bassler B.L. Bacterial quorum-sensing network architectures.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, AI-2 must be imported into cells and phosphorylated by the AI-2 kinase LsrK, which triggers the shift of gene expression (11Xavier K.B. Bassler B.L. Regulation of uptake and processing of the quorum-sensing autoinducer AI-2 in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In E. coli, four genes, lsrACDB, encode the ATP-binding cassette transporter responsible for the internalization of AI-2. These four genes, together with two other genes, lsrFG, are the lsr operon (12Xavier K.B. Miller S.T. Lu W. Kim J.H. Rabinowitz J. Pelczer I. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. Phosphorylation and processing of the quorum-sensing molecule autoinducer-2 in enteric bacteria.ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the absence of p-AI-2, the expression of the lsr operon is repressed by LsrR, the key sensor of p-AI-2. p-AI-2 binds directly to LsrR and derepresses the expression of the lsr operon (12Xavier K.B. Miller S.T. Lu W. Kim J.H. Rabinowitz J. Pelczer I. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. Phosphorylation and processing of the quorum-sensing molecule autoinducer-2 in enteric bacteria.ACS Chem.

LsrR-binding site recognition and regulatory characteristics in Escherichia coli AI-2 quorum sensing.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 1258-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that LsrR binds a consensus sequence in the promoter region of the lsr operon. p-AI-2 relieves LsrR from the lsr promoter to active transcription of lsr operon (15Xue T. Zhao L. Sun H. Zhou X. Sun B. LsrR-binding site recognition and regulatory characteristics in Escherichia coli AI-2 quorum sensing.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 1258-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to controlling the transcription of the lsr operon, LsrR serves as a global regulator of a variety of genes in response to p-AI-2 (14Li J. Attila C. Wang L. Wood T.K. Valdes J.J. Bentley W.E. Quorum sensing in Escherichia coli is signaled by AI-2/LsrR: effects on small RNA and biofilm architecture.J.

Quieting cross talk–the quorum sensing regulator LsrR as a possible target for fighting bacterial infections.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 1229-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although LsrR is important in p-AI-2 sensing and gene transcription regulation, its detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear. LsrR was cloned, expressed, and purified as described with minor modifications (17Liu X. Wu M. Sun D. Zang J. Cloning, purification, crystallization, and preliminary crystallographic analysis of LsrR from Escherichia coli.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 913-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In brief, genes encoding LsrR and its mutants were individually cloned into a pET28a expression vector with a C-terminal His6 tag for overexpression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). Target proteins were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare) followed by gel filtration. Purified LsrR protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml for crystallization. For cross-linking assays, LsrR and mutants were concentrated to about 1 mg/ml in buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0). Protein purity was assessed by electrophoresis, and protein samples were stored at −80 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with wild-type LsrR plasmid as the template. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified as above. Crystals were grown at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, initially mixing 1 μl of protein solution with an equal volume of reservoir solution (0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, 6% PEG 8000 (w/v), 8% ethylene glycol (v/v)). Crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, 6% PEG 8000 (w/v), 8% ethylene glycol (v/v), and 10% glycerol (v/v) for several seconds and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the synchrotron radiation beamline BL17U1 of SSRF (Shanghai, China). Data were integrated and scaled using the program HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38551) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was carried out with the program Phaser (19McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14499) Google Scholar) in the CCP4i suite (20Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr.

After the initial phase was obtained, the LsrR structural model was automatically built using the program Buccaneer (21Cowtan K. The Buccaneer software for automated model building. 1. Tracing protein chains.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1002-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). After several rounds of refinement by REFMAC5 (22Murshudov G.N.

The N-terminal loop (residues 1–9) and the loop connecting β6–α11 (residues 215–224) in two molecules in the asymmetric unit are missing. The quality of the final model was analyzed with the program MolProbity (24Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S.

The molar ratio of protein to ligand was 1:20, and the volume was 50 μl. Cross-linking was on ice for 30 min before quenching by addition of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The molar ratio of LsrR to disuccinimidyl suberate was 1:20. Reactions were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized using Coomassie G-250 staining. The purified wild-type or mutant (V153E and P173A,P175A) LsrR proteins in the presence or absence of AI-2 and p-AI-2 were loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with column buffer and eluted using the same buffer. DNA fragment p-lsrR (119 bp) containing the lsrR promoter was prepared by PCR from E. coli genomic DNA using the primers 5′-AATTCATTCTTCACTTTGAACAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTATGCTATTTTGATTTTCACGG-3′ (reverse). A digoxigenin (DIG) gel shift kit (second generation, Roche Applied Science) was used to label DNA fragments and detect signals, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding reactions were performed by incubating labeled DNA fragments with purified LsrR wild-type or mutant protein at 4 °C for 10 min in 10 μl of incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation, 2.5 μl of gel loading buffer (0.25× TBE; 34% glycerol) was added, and samples were electrophoresed in 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Model structures of p-AI-2 were prepared using the program PRODRG (26Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. PRODRG: a tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein-ligand complexes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional models of p-AI-2-LsrR complexes were simulated using the program HADDOCK (27Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. HADDOCK: a protein-protein docking approach based on biochemical or biophysical information.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar). Docking was started with p-AI-2 and LsrR and driven by interaction restraints with active residues (Lys-288 and Asp-243). Amino acid sequence alignments of LsrRs used the programs ClustalW2 (28Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R.

Stuart D.I. Métoz F. ESPript: analysis of multiple sequence alignments in PostScript.Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). To determine the regulation mechanism of LsrR in response to p-AI-2, we overexpressed and purified full-length E. coli LsrR and crystallized it in the presence or absence of p-AI-2. However, we obtained LsrR crystals only in free form. LsrR crystals diffracted to 3.0 Å resolution, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement. The structure was refined to Rfactor/Rfree of 21.7/26.7% and showed good geometry as determined by the MolProbity program. The LsrR protomer had two distinct domains, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), connected by a linker region containing a β-strand (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal DBD had three α-helices (α1, α2, and α3) with α2 and α3 forming a helix-turn-helix motif, typical of DNA-binding proteins (Fig. 1B). After the DBD, a β-strand (β1) linker region connected the DBD and LDB (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal LBD adopted an α/β/α sandwich architecture. Seven β-strands formed a central core of twisted parallel β-sheets, flanked by helices α4, α10, α13, and α14 on the one side and α5, α6, α7, and α8 on the other side (Fig. 1C). Two additional β-strands (β7 and β8) and four additional helices (α9, α11, α12, and α15) inserted in different loop regions connecting the elements in the α/β/α sandwich architecture (Fig. 1C). Two LsrR subunits in one asymmetric unit form a dimer through interactions around the β1-strand from each subunit (Figs. 1D and 3C). Both the DBDs and LBDs of the two molecules were similar, with root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of 0.526 and 0.635 Å over 42 and 220 aligned Cα atoms, respectively. Only small differences were observed in terminal loops of the two DBDs (Fig. 2A). In the two LBDs, helix α4 of subunit B was longer than in subunit A, and the loops connecting β2-α5 and α8-β5 adopted different conformations (Fig. 2B). Although the structures of the LBDs and DBDs in the two subunits were almost identical, the relative orientations of two domains in each subunit were different. As a consequence, subunit A folded into a compacted conformation different from the extended conformation of subunit B. When the LBDs of subunit A and B were superposed, the DBDs showed a rotation of about 120° (Fig. 1E).FIGURE 2Structural comparison of DBDs and LBDs of two subunits in one asymmetric unit.

Furthermore, the salt bridge between Arg-67 and Asp-95 in subunit B was replaced by a bridge between Glu-69 and Arg-88 in subunit A (Figs. 2C and 1E). These variations induced the observed conformational differences. LsrR was observed to be a tetramer in solution, consistent with PISA analysis (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6800) Google Scholar) and a previous report (15Xue T. Zhao L. Sun H. Zhou X. Sun B. LsrR-binding site recognition and regulatory characteristics in Escherichia coli AI-2 quorum sensing.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 1258-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, only two LsrR molecules (A and B) were found in one asymmetric unit in the crystals (Fig. 1D). The neighboring dimer CD, related by the crystallographic 2-fold rotation symmetry, packed tightly against the dimer AB (Fig. 3A). Two interaction interfaces between dimers AB and CD were formed by interactions between the LBDs of AD and BC (Fig. 3A). Because each subunit of the LsrR tetramer interacted directly with two adjacent subunits in different conformations, two types of dimeric interfaces were created, interface I (AD/BC) and interface II (AB/CD) (Fig. 3A). Because dimers AD and BC or AB and CD were related by the crystallographic 2-fold rotation symmetry (Fig. 3A), there were two identical interface I and interface II in LsrR tetramer. For simplicity, we discuss only the interface I (AD) and interface II (AB). The interface I had interactions between α8, α9, and the loops connecting β4-α8 and β5-α9 from each subunit (Fig. 3B). The interactions between subunit A and D were mainly hydrophobic. The large hydrophobic core architecture involved apolar residues Val-153, Met-157, Ile-160, Ile-171, Pro-173, Ala-174, Pro-175, Ile-183, and Leu-187 from each subunit. In addition, Glu-190 from subunit A formed a hydrogen bond with Ser-179 from subunit D and vice versa (Fig. 3B). The buried surface area of interface I, as analyzed by PISA (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6800) Google Scholar), was about 800 Å2. Thus, the total buried surface area of the interfaces between dimers AB and CD was about 1600 Å2, which was strong enough to tether these two dimers to form a stable tetramer in solution. However, in interface II, the β1 strands from subunit A and B were antiparallel, pulling the two subunits together. Additional contacts surrounding the β1 strands reinforced interactions between subunit A and B. Interactions between A and B were mainly polar, including 11 hydrogen bonds and three salt bridges (Fig. 3C and Table 2). As a result, the buried surface area of interface II, analyzed with PISA (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6800) Google Scholar), was estimated to be 1750 Å2, much larger than the interface I.TABLE 2Interaction amino acid residues of interface IIChain BChain ADistanceÅHydrogen bondsHis-28 (NE2)Val-62 (O)3.2Arg-61 (N)Gln-63 (O)3.1Gln-63 (N)Arg-61 (O)2.8Asn-65 (N)Ile-59 (O)2.6Asn-65 (ND2)Gly-58 (O)3.1Gly-58 (O)Asn-65 (ND2)3.6Ile-59 (O)Asn-65 (N)2.8Arg-61 (O)Gln-63 (N)3.0Val-62 (O)His-28 (NE2)3.4Gln-63 (O)Arg-61 (N)2.9Gln-63 (OE1)Arg-61 (NH1)3.0Salt bridgesArg-67 (NH2)Glu-16 (OE1)3.2Asp-29 (OD2)Arg-101 (NH1)2.4Glu-75 (OE2)Arg-21 (NH2)2.4 Open table in a new tab The overall arrangement of the LsrR tetramer was different from the usual tetrameric assembly in which individual subunits were related either by a single 4-fold symmetry axis or by three mutually perpendicular 2-fold axes. In contrast, the assembly of LsrR tetramer could be regarded as the dimer of two LsrR dimers, which has been observed in other transcriptional regulators. For example, the tetrameric assembly of the full-length sorbitol operon regulator SorC from K. pneumoniae, which can be viewed as the dimer of two dimers, is similar to the LsrR tetramer (31de Sanctis D. McVey C.E. Enguita F.J.

The human genome codes for two presenilin paralogs. To understand the causes for distinct phenotypes of PS paralog-deficient mice and elucidate whether PS mutations associated with early-onset AD affect the molecular environment of mature γ-secretase complexes, quantitative interactome comparisons were undertaken. Brains of mice engineered to express wild-type or mutant PS1, or HEK293 cells stably expressing PS paralogs with N-terminal tandem-affinity purification tags served as biological source materials. The analyses revealed novel interactions of the γ-secretase core complex with a molecular machinery that targets and fuses synaptic vesicles to cellular membranes and with the H(+)-transporting lysosomal ATPase macrocomplex but uncovered no differences in the interactomes of wild-type and mutant PS1. The catenin/cadherin network was almost exclusively found associated with PS1. Another intramembrane protease, signal peptide peptidase, predominantly co-purified with PS2-containing γ-secretase complexes and was observed to influence Aβ production."
https://openalex.org/W2054422229,"The production of viable cysts by Giardia is essential for its survival in the environment and for spreading the infection via contaminated food and water. The hallmark of cyst production (also known as encystation) is the biogenesis of encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs) that transport cyst wall proteins to the plasma membrane of the trophozoite before laying down the protective cyst wall. However, the molecules that regulate ESV biogenesis and maintain cyst viability have never before been identified. Here, we report that giardial glucosylceramide transferase-1 (gGlcT1), an enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis, plays a key role in ESV biogenesis and maintaining cyst viability. We find that overexpression of this enzyme induced the formation of aggregated/enlarged ESVs and generated clustered cysts with reduced viability. The silencing of gGlcT1 synthesis by antisense morpholino oligonucleotide abolished ESV production and generated mostly nonviable cysts. Interestingly, when gGlcT1-overexpressed Giardia was transfected with anti-gGlcT1 morpholino, the enzyme activity, vesicle biogenesis, and cyst viability returned to normal, suggesting that the regulated expression of gGlcT1 is important for encystation and viable cyst production. Furthermore, the overexpression of gGlcT1 increased the influx of membrane lipids and fatty acids without altering the fluidity of plasma membranes, indicating that the expression of gGlcT1 activity is linked to lipid internalization and maintaining the overall lipid balance in this parasite.

This intestinal parasite exists in two morphologic forms, trophozoites and cysts. Although trophozoites colonize the small intestine and produce infections, cysts transmit the disease via contaminated water and food (1Adam R.D. Biology of Giardia lamblia.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Stage-specific differentiation of cyst to trophozoite, which takes place in the human stomach, is known as excystation, whereas the transformation from trophozoites to cysts that occurs in the small intestine is called encystation. Giardial cyst walls contain insoluble filamentous materials made of proteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides (2Das S. Gillin F.D.

Emerging reports indicate that the enzymes and products of sphingolipid (SL) biosynthesis pathways act as regulators of various cellular processes in both lower and higher eukaryotes. For instance, ceramide synthase activity is associated with increased tumor growth and progression in head and neck cancers (10Separovic D. Breen P. Joseph N. Bielawski J. Pierce J.S. VAN Buren E. Gudz T.I. Ceramide synthase 6 knockdown suppresses apoptosis after photodynamic therapy in human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells.Anticancer Res. 2012; 32: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingosine 1-phosphate has been shown to generate initial signals for apoptotic cell extrusion (11Gu Y. Forostyan T. Sabbadini R. Rosenblatt J.

In plants, the synthesis of four different classes of SLs and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) was observed, including glycosylinositolphosphoceramides, glycosylceramides, ceramides, and free LCBs. Several enzymes of plant SL metabolic pathways have also been cloned and characterized (14Pata M.O. Hannun Y.A. Ng C.K. Plant sphingolipids: decoding the enigma of the Sphinx.New Phytol. 2010; 185: 611-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). SLs are also critical for regulating various biological processes in unicellular organisms like fungi and protozoa. In budding yeast, SLs contain C26 acyl moieties and are connected with the target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) and phosphoinositide signaling (15Dickson R.C. Thematic review series: sphingolipids. New insights into sphingolipid metabolism and function in budding yeast.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 909-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites, the synthesis of large amounts of nonglycosylated inositol phosphorylceramides, and ethanolamine phosphorylceramides, along with other SLs, have been reported. These SLs in trypanosomatids contribute greatly to the growth and survival of parasites within the host and have important functions during host-parasite interactions (16Zhang K. Bangs J.D. Beverley S.M. Sphingolipids in parasitic protozoa.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 688: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As far as giardial SLs are concerned, only five genes of the entire SL metabolic pathway have been annotated in the Giardia Genome Database, and they are all transcribed differentially between trophozoites and cysts (17Hernandez Y.

These genes are as follows: (i) giardial serine-palmitoyltransferase-1 and -2 subunit genes (gspt-1 and gspt-2), (ii) glucosylceramide synthase or glucosylceramide transferase 1 (gglct-1), and (iii) two acid sphingomyelinase genes (gasmase 3b and gsmase B). It was reported that d-threo-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), an inhibitor of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase (GCS or GlcT1), interferes with encystation and cyst production by Giardia, suggesting that GlcCer synthesis is important for encystation (17Hernandez Y.

Despite this information, the exact mechanisms by which this enzyme and its product regulate the ESV biogenesis and cyst production are still not clear. This study focuses on understanding the unique and precise function of gGlcT1 and its role in encystation and cyst formation. Here, we report that modulation of gGlcT1 activity by overexpression and knockdown affects the ESV biogenesis and cyst viability of Giardia. We also provide evidence that gGlcT1 overexpression destabilizes lipid balance in this parasite by increasing the influx of lipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids from the culture medium.

Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar) using modified TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 5% adult bovine serum and 1% bovine bile (20Keister D.B.

The antibiotic piperacillin (100 μg/ml) was added during routine culturing of the parasite (21Gillin F.D. Boucher S.E. Rossi S.S. Reiner D.S. Giardia lamblia: the roles of bile, lactic acid, and pH in the completion of the life cycle in vitro.Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Trophozoites were detached from the culture flask by ice chilling and harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by three washings in sterile PBS and microscopic determination of cell numbers using a hemocytometer. In vitro encystation was carried out by culturing the trophozoites in TYI-S-33 medium, pH 7.8, supplemented with adult bovine serum (10%, v/v), lactic acid (5 mm), and porcine bile (250 mg/ml) for various time points, as described below (21Gillin F.D. Boucher S.E. Rossi S.S. Reiner D.S. Giardia lamblia: the roles of bile, lactic acid, and pH in the completion of the life cycle in vitro.Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to encyst for 72 h, and cysts were isolated by centrifugation (2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), washed three times in cold distilled water, and kept in water for 3 days in a refrigerator (4–8 °C). Isolated water-resistant cysts were counted or subjected to the microscopic experiments also described below. For overexpression, a small peptide epitope (AU1)-tagged pNT5 expression plasmid (obtained from Dr. Chin-Hung Sun, Taiwan) containing the gglct1 gene was constructed following the method described by Pan et al. (22Pan Y.J. Cho C.C. Kao Y.Y. Sun C.H. A novel WRKY-like protein involved in transcriptional activation of cyst wall protein genes in Giardia lamblia.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17975-17988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the entire open reading frame of gglct1 ORF_11642 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GCGCCATGGATGGACGGGTTGACTCTCTCC-3′ and 5′-GCGGAATTCTCAGATGTATCGATACGTATCGTCGAGGGATTTTTT-3′. The insert was digested with EcoRI/NcoI and ligated into EcoRI/NcoI-digested dephosphorylated pNT5 plasmid (22Pan Y.J. Cho C.C. Kao Y.Y. Sun C.H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 17975-17988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This new plasmid pNT5-gglct1 was then transformed into competent DH5α cells and plated onto LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were screened by PCR, and positive colonies were sequenced at the University of Texas-El Paso DNA core facility. The ABI Prism BigDye Terminator version 3.1 cycling sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) was used to amplify the DNA with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides. The sequencing reaction was subsequently cleaned using Agincourt Clean SEQ (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The parasites were placed in a 4-mm electroporation tube (Fisher Biotech, Waltham, MA) in a 300-μl suspension of TYI-SS media; 40 μg of the pNT5-gglct1 plasmid was resuspended in the cell suspension. Trophozoites were then transfected by electroporation on a Gene Pulser X cell (Bio-Rad) using the following parameters: 322 V, 500 microfarads, and ∞Ω resistance (4-mm cuvette). Cells were allowed to recuperate in media overnight after electroporation, followed by selection with 100 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Stable transfectant trophozoites overexpressing gGlcT1 (+gGlcT1) were established within 2 weeks. Cultured Giardia trophozoites were harvested by centrifugation as described above. Parasites were placed in a 4-mm electroporation tube (Fisher Biotech) in a 300-μl suspension of the media, transfected (using the same setting as the overexpression described above) with anti-gglct1 (5′-CTAAGGAGAGAGTCAACCCGTCCAT-3′), and scrambled (mismatch) with (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) morpholino oligonucleotides (custom ordered from Gene Tools, Inc., Philomath, OR) following the protocol described previously by Carpenter and Cande (23Carpenter M.L. Cande W.Z. Using morpholinos for gene knockdown in Giardia intestinalis.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). gglct1-knockdown trophozoites were resuspended in media and left to recover for 6 h for additional experimentation. Giardial trophozoites were electroporated with 50 μm of anti-ggclt1 morpholino and/or treated with PPMP (10 μm) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and mounted with Prolong® Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) in a four-well chambered slide as described above without any further treatments. At least 100 singlet, doublet, and triplet trophozoites from 10 different fields were viewed and counted by confocal microscopy (Zeiss-LSM 700) using Zen 2009 software (Carl Zeiss, Irvine, CA). The percentage values of doublet cells were calculated based on the total number of cells (singlet, doublet, and triplet). The stable transfectants of Giardia trophozoites overexpressing gGlcT1 were generated as described above. gGlcT1-overexpressing trophozoites were then transfected with anti-gGlcT1 morpholino oligonucleotide following the procedure also described above. After antisense morpholino oligonucleotide transfection, gGlcT1-overexpressing trophozoites were allowed to recover for 6 h before conducting the experiments described below. The activity of the gGlcT1 enzyme in Giardia trophozoites, encysting cells, cysts, gGlcT1-overexpressing, and gGlcT1-knockdown cells was measured using the methods described for mammalian and Plasmodium cells (24Uchida Y.

Each reaction tube contained phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4), enzyme extracts (1500 × g supernatant), UDP-[14C]glucose (∼100,000 cpm/assay), protease inhibitors (2.5% 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 5 μm E-64), 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm β-NAD, and the liposomal substrate containing 0.1 nmol of ceramide mixed with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in a ratio of 1:10 (v/v) (total volume, 100 μl). The mixture was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C and extracted with chloroform (CHCl3)/methanol (MeOH), 1:1 v/v, and the formation of enzymatic product ([14C]GlcCer) was assessed by measuring the radioactivity in a scintillation counter (Beckman, Brea, CA). The assay was conducted in the presence and absence of PPMP (10 μm), a common inhibitor of GlcCer synthesis (26Stefanić S. Spycher C. Morf L. Fabriàs G. Casas J. Schraner E. Wild P. Hehl A.B.

A total of 50 μm of NBD-C6 ceramide-BSA complex (Invitrogen) was added and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Sphingolipids were extracted in a solvent in a mixture containing 1.3 ml of acetic acid/MeOH (1:50, v/v), 1.3 ml of CHCl3, and 1.3 ml of Milli-Q H2O (28Stevens T.L. Gibson G.R. Adam R. Maier J.

The lower CHCl3 phase was pooled and dried under nitrogen. Samples were resolved on TLC (Whatman) using the following solution: 170 ml of CHCl3, 30 ml of MeOH, and 2 ml of 3.5 n ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). The formation of NBD-C6-glucosylceramide was visualized under a UV lamp (27Gupta V. Patwardhan G.A. Zhang Q.J. Cabot M.C. Jazwinski S.M. Liu Y.Y.

To evaluate the transition from nonencysting to encysting trophozoites and cysts as well as to identify ESVs, cells were labeled with anti-cyst antibody (1:100) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. This anti-cyst antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was raised against intact cysts and therefore recognizes all cyst wall proteins (CWP1, CWP2, and CWP3). Trophozoites were cultivated and subjected to encystation in a cultured medium as described before (21Gillin F.D. Boucher S.E. Rossi S.S. Reiner D.S. Giardia lamblia: the roles of bile, lactic acid, and pH in the completion of the life cycle in vitro.Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, transferred, and fixed to four-chambered slides using 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed samples were allowed to react with anti-cyst antibody overnight at 6–10 °C, followed by reacting with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500) (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were subsequently mounted with Prolong® Gold antifade reagent mixed with DAPI (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed in a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Laser Scanning Systems LSM 700), using the Zen 2009 software (Carl Zeiss) for acquisition and image analysis. Control and gGlcT1-overexpressing trophozoites were harvested and allowed to adhere in the Nunc Lab-Tek II 4-well chamber slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with different fluorescent lipid probes, i.e. Bodipy-phosphatidylcholine (Bodipy-PC; 100 nm); NBD-phosphatidylglycerol (NBD-PG, 1 μm); Bodipy-phosphatidylethanolamine (Bodipy-PE, 100 nm); Bodipy-ceramide (200 nm, Bodipy-sphingomyelin (Bodipy-SM, 200 nm); or FAST Dil (1 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (28Stevens T.L.

Parasitol. 1997; 86: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, mounted with ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen), and visualized by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss Laser Scanning Systems LSM 700). The fluorescence intensities were quantified with the help of the Zeiss ZEN 2009 confocal software (Carl Zeiss). Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) inclusion and propidium iodide (PI) exclusion experiments were performed to monitor cyst viability. Briefly, a 25 mm stock solution of FDA and PI (Sigma) was prepared in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, from which a working solution was made by adding 40 μl of stock to 10 ml of phosphate buffer. gGlcT1-overexpressing and gGlcT1-knockdown trophozoites were subjected to encystation as described above, and the water-resistant cysts were collected by centrifugation. Approximately 107 cysts were subjected to FDA and PI staining as described previously by Gillin et al. (21Gillin F.D. Boucher S.E. Rossi S.S. Reiner D.S. Giardia lamblia: the roles of bile, lactic acid, and pH in the completion of the life cycle in vitro.Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cysts were then washed with PBS, mounted on a slide with DAKO mounting media (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), and viewed under the Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using Zen 2009 software (Carl Zeiss). Giardial cells were isolated and resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture and E-64 (1 μm, Sigma). The sample was freeze thawed at −80 °C, boiled in sample buffer before being analyzed (40 μg protein/lane) by 10% SDS-PAGE, and followed by immunoblotting analysis on the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked in 1% BSA, incubated with anti-cyst antibody (monoclonal, 1:100), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The PVDF membrane was then incubated with anti-mouse HRP conjugate (1:10,000; KPL, Inc., Washington, D. C.) for 30 min at room temperature. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) technique was used for the detection of protein bands. Sterol analysis in control and gGlcT1-overexpressing trophozoites was carried out according to the method of Fridberg et al. (29Fridberg A. Olson C.L. Nakayasu E.S. Tyler K.M. Almeida I.C.

Trophozoites (∼1 × 108) were grown and harvested as described above, resuspended in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (1:2:0.8, v/v/v), and centrifuged (1500 × g) at room temperature for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and dried under nitrogen, and the pellet was then extracted with CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v) three times and with CHCl3/MeOH: H2O (1:2:0.8, v/v/v) twice before being dried under a nitrogen stream. The supernatants obtained from these six extractions were pooled together before"
https://openalex.org/W1995182751,"Corynebacterium glutamicum is an important industrial bacterium as well as a model organism for the order Corynebacteriales, whose citric acid cycle occupies a central position in energy and precursor supply. Expression of aconitase, which isomerizes citrate into isocitrate, is controlled by several transcriptional regulators, including the dimeric aconitase repressor AcnR, assigned by sequence identity to the TetR family. We report the structures of AcnR in two crystal forms together with ligand binding experiments and in vivo studies. First, there is a citrate-Mg2+ moiety bound in both forms, not in the canonical TetR ligand binding site but rather in a second pocket more distant from the DNA binding domain. Second, the citrate-Mg2+ binds with a KD of 6 mm, within the range of physiological significance. Third, citrate-Mg2+ lowers the affinity of AcnR for its target DNA in vitro. Fourth, analyses of several AcnR point mutations provide evidence for the possible involvement of the corresponding residues in ligand binding, DNA binding, and signal transfer.

Significance: AcnR is the first TetR member with potentially two independent ligand binding sites. Identification of citrate-Mg2+ as a ligand is crucial for understanding its physiological role. Corynebacterium glutamicum is a non-pathogenic, predominantly aerobic Gram-positive soil bacterium that can excrete glutamate (1Kinoshita S. Udaka S. Shimono M. Studies of amino acid fermentation. I. Production of l-glutamic acid by various microorganisms.J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1957; 3: 193-205Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and is used industrially for the large scale production of amino acids, in particular l-glutamate (about 2.16 million tons/year) and l-lysine (about 1.48 million tons/year). Because the world market for amino acids is continuously increasing, there are ongoing efforts to improve production strains and processes (2Leuchtenberger W. Huthmacher K. Drauz K. Biotechnological production of amino acids and derivatives. Current status and prospects.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 69: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). C. glutamicum has also gained interest as a model organism for the order Corynebacteriales, which includes the human pathogens Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A wealth of knowledge on C. glutamicum has been summarized in a handbook (3Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005Crossref Google Scholar) and two monographs (4Burkovski A. Corynebacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology. Caister Academic Press, Norfolk, UK2008Google Scholar, 5Yukawa H. Inui M. Corynebacterium glutamicum: Biology and Biotechnology. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg2013Crossref Google Scholar). The citric acid (tricarboxylic acid, TCA) 5The abbreviations used are: TCA, tricarboxylic acid; DBD, DNA-binding domain; LBD, dimerization and ligand-binding domain; TEV, tobacco etch virus; D pocket, distal pocket; P pocket, proximal pocket; r.m.s., root mean square; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HTH, helix-turn-helix; RU, resonance units. cycle of C. glutamicum has been studied intensively because of its importance in energy metabolism and in the production of the amino acid precursors oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate (6Bott M.

TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt of Corynebacterium glutamicum.in: Yukawa H. Inui M. Corynebacterium glutamicum: Biology and Biotechnology. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg2013: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). Because substrate carbon is lost as carbon dioxide in the TCA cycle, regulation of the carbon flux through this cycle is of special interest for biotechnological production processes. AcnR was identified as the first transcriptional regulator of a TCA cycle enzyme in C. glutamicum and functions as a repressor of acn, which is to date its only known target gene (8Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. Identification of AcnR, a TetR-type repressor of the aconitase gene acn in Corynebacterium glutamicum.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AcnR is conserved in all corynebacteria and mycobacteria and binds as a dimer to an imperfect inverted repeat (5′-CAGAACGCTTGTACTG-3′) located within the −10/−35 region of the acn promoter. Comparison with the acn promoter region of other species identified a consensus binding motif (CAGNACnnncGTACTG). An acnR deletion mutant grows slightly faster than the wild type on glucose or acetate minimal medium and has an increased aconitase activity (5.3-fold higher on glucose and 1.9-fold higher on acetate). When cultivated in a medium with a low iron content, overproduction of aconitase in the acnR mutant causes iron limitation (8Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Aconitase is the second enzyme in the TCA cycle and catalyzes the stereospecific isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate (9Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D.

TCA cycle regulation in Corynebacterium glutamicum.Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 417-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the latter, it catalyzes the conversion of 2-methylaconitate to 2-methylisocitrate. In contrast to organisms such as Escherichia coli (11Gruer M.J. Guest J.R. 2 genetically-distinct and differentially-regulated aconitases (AcnA and AcnB) in Escherichia coli.Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2531-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), C. glutamicum possesses only a single aconitase containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is crucial for catalytic activity and which is highly oxygen-sensitive (10Baumgart M.

Wendisch V.F. Bott M. Identification of AcnR, a TetR-type repressor of the aconitase gene acn in Corynebacterium glutamicum.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, an aconitase deletion mutant faces strong selection pressure to lose citrate synthase activity, probably caused by high intracellular citrate concentrations (12Baumgart M. Mustafi N.

Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 6864-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This explains the tight regulation of acn in C. glutamicum by at least four different regulators, AcnR, RipA (14Wennerhold J. Krug A. Bott M. The AraC-type regulator RipA represses aconitase and other iron proteins from Corynebacterium under iron limitation and is itself repressed by DtxR.J. Biol.

RipA is part of the iron homeostasis control system and represses transcription of acn under iron starvation conditions (17Frunzke J. Bott M. Regulation of iron homeostasis in Corynebacterium glutamicum.in: Burkovski A. Corynebacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology. Caister Academic Press, Norfolk, UK2008: 241-266Google Scholar). Activation of acn transcription by RamA during growth on acetate is probably required to allow for an increased flux through the TCA cycle on this substrate (13Wendisch V.F. de Graaf A.A. Sahm H.

AcnR belongs to the TetR family of dimeric transcriptional regulators (21Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), whose members contain an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal dimerization and ligand-binding domain (LBD) (22Yu Z.

Biol. 2010; 400: 847-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although there are large differences in the LBD, which allow for the response to different ligands, the sequence and structure of the DBD are highly conserved. Although several three-dimensional structures of TetR-type regulators have been determined, there are only four examples where all three functional forms (free protein, complex with operator, and complex with effector) are known: E. coli TetR (23Orth P.

It is assumed that binding of a ligand to the LBD causes AcnR to be released from the DNA, allowing the expression of the aconitase gene. Although a large number of putative effector compounds were tested, no ligand of AcnR was identified in previous studies (8Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. Identification of AcnR, a TetR-type repressor of the aconitase gene acn in Corynebacterium glutamicum.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Current structures of TetR family proteins reveal the evolution of two different types of binding pockets. In the first, the two symmetric subunits contribute to form a single large pocket, whereas the second contains two independent symmetrically located smaller pockets, one within each subunit. This latter site, where tetracycline binds in TetR, we will refer to as the canonical site. The nature of the ligand is critical for understanding the regulatory mechanism and physiological function of AcnR, and we initiated structural studies with the aim of establishing its identity (31García-Nafría J. Baumgart M. Bott M. Wilkinson A.J. Wilson K.S. The Corynebacterium glutamicum aconitase repressor. Scratching around for crystals.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Here, we present crystal structures of AcnR showing that citrate-Mg2+ binds to a quite different non-canonical pocket. The affinity of the citrate-Mg2+, measured using surface plasmon resonance, is shown to be within the biologically relevant range. The presence of Mg2+ is strictly required for citrate binding to AcnR, which significantly lowers the affinity of AcnR for DNA. Although AcnR does contain a bigger canonical pocket similar to that of the tetracycline site in TetR, this site is empty in our structures. Finally, we relate the properties of a set of AcnR variants to our structural and biochemical studies. All strains and plasmids used are listed in supplemental Table S1. For plasmid-harboring strains, the medium was supplemented with 25 mg liter−1 (C. glutamicum) or 50 mg liter−1 (E. coli) kanamycin. For induction of target genes cloned into the expression plasmid pEKEx2 or pAN6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used in concentrations as specified. For cloning purposes, E. coli DH5α was used and grown at 37 °C in lysogeny broth (LB) (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The enzymes for recombinant DNA work were obtained from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany) or Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon (Cologne, Germany) and are listed in supplemental Table S2. Routine methods such as PCR, restriction, and ligation were performed using standard protocols (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA of C. glutamicum was prepared as described previously (33Eikmanns B.J. Thum-Schmitz N. Eggeling L. Lüdtke K.U. Sahm H. Nucleotide-sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Corynebacterium glutamicum gltA gene encoding citrate synthase.Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). E. coli plasmids were isolated using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). E. coli was transformed using the RbCl method (34Hanahan D. Studies on transformation of Escherichia coli with plasmids.J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8170) Google Scholar). The plasmid pET-TEV-AcnR was constructed as follows. The AcnR coding region was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides acnR-Krist-for-NdeI and acnR-Krist-rev-XhoI and chromosomal DNA of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 as template. After digestion with NdeI and XhoI, the PCR product was cloned into the expression vector pET-TEV cut with the same restriction enzymes. The pET-TEV-AcnR-encoded AcnR derivative contained 29 additional N-terminal amino acids (MGSSHHHHHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGH), of which, after cleavage with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, only three additional amino acids (GHM) remained at the N terminus. The plasmid pET-TEV-MtAcnR was constructed according to pET-TEV-AcnR, using the oligonucleotides Mt_AcnR_NdeI_fw and Mt_AcnR_XhoI_rv and chromosomal DNA of M. tuberculosis strain H37rv as template. For the plasmid pMal-c-MtAcnR, the acnR gene of M. tuberculosis and the codons of the TEV cleavage site were amplified using the oligonucleotides TEV-site-Eco-fw and Mt_AcnR_XbaI_rv and the plasmid pET-TEV-MtAcnR as template. After digestion with EcoRI and XbaI, the PCR product was cloned into the plasmid pMal-c cut with the same restriction enzymes. The MtAcnR derivative encoded by this plasmid contains the maltose-binding protein of E. coli at its N terminus, which can be cleaved off by TEV protease as described above. Plasmids which code for C. glutamicum AcnR variants with single amino acid exchanges (C23A, K43A, K55A, E65A, D66A, R69A, M70A, M86A, R92A, W95A, R99A, K104A, D119A, R130A, R141A, D143A, D158A, E181A, and R185A) were constructed with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the plasmids pEKEx2-acnR-C-Strep or pET-TEV-AcnR as template and the oligonucleotides listed in supplemental Table S2. pEKEx2-acnR-C-Strep is an E. coli/C. glutamicum shuttle plasmid and allows overproduction of an AcnR derivative containing 10 additional C-terminal amino acids (LEWSHPQFEK), including a StrepTag-II sequence. The StrepTag-II allows for affinity purification of AcnR by StrepTactin affinity chromatography (35Schmidt T.G. Skerra A. The Strep-tag system for one-step purification and high-affinity detection or capturing of proteins.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This was carried out as described earlier (31García-Nafría J. Baumgart M. Bott M. Wilkinson A.J. Wilson K.S. The Corynebacterium glutamicum aconitase repressor. Scratching around for crystals.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In contrast to our earlier studies (8Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. Identification of AcnR, a TetR-type repressor of the aconitase gene acn in Corynebacterium glutamicum.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), tag-free AcnR was used here for all experiments because (i) AcnR proved to be more stable over longer time periods without the tag; (ii) although the tag did not interfere with DNA binding, it might influence ligand binding to AcnR; and (iii) crystallization trials with His-tagged AcnR were not successful. Overexpression and purification were performed as described previously (36Niebisch A. Kabus A. Schultz C. Weil B. Bott M. Corynebacterial protein kinase G controls 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity via the phosphorylation status of the OdhI protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12300-12307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Subsequently, gel filtration was performed with a SuperdexTM 200 10/300 GL column connected to an ÄktaTM FPLC system using the same buffer as for the His tag derivative. The mutant derivatives of AcnR were concentrated to 0.07–0.27 mg ml−1 and stored frozen as for the wild-type protein. Overexpression using the plasmid pMal-c-MtAcnR was performed as described for pET-TEV-AcnR except that after induction, the cells were further cultivated at 15 °C overnight. The cells from 50 ml of culture were resuspended in 4 ml of buffer M (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl)/g of cells, and protease inhibitor was added (10 μl each of 100 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 100 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphates per ml of cell suspension). Cell disruption and cell extract preparation were performed as described above. An amylose resin (New England Biolabs) column with a bed volume of 5 ml was equilibrated with buffer M. The cell extract was applied onto the column, followed by washing with 20 ml of buffer M. Elution was performed with buffer M additionally containing 10 mm maltose. AcnR was crystallized as described previously (31García-Nafría J. Baumgart M. Bott M. Wilkinson A.J. Wilson K.S. The Corynebacterium glutamicum aconitase repressor. Scratching around for crystals.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In brief, crystals were obtained with protein concentrated at 26.5 mg ml−1 incubated with 5 mm sodium citrate and 5 mm MgCl2 and set up in 300 + 300-μl drops of 1 m ammonium phosphate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4, and optimized. Data were collected on two native crystals, one on beamline I02 at the Diamond Light Source and another on beamline ID-29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).

Scaling and assessment of data quality.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar) revealed that there were two crystal forms, both in Laue group Pmmm, which differ by a doubling of the c axis in Form II. Subsequent calculations were carried out with programs from the CCP4 suite (40Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B. Leslie A.G. McCoy A.

Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9206) Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated. Form I is in space group P21212 with data to 1.9 Å spacing with one protomer per asymmetric unit, and Form II is in P212121 with data to 1.6 Å with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The two independent protomers in the Form II crystal have significant conformational differences in the canonical pocket (see below). A heavy atom derivative was obtained (31García-Nafría J. Baumgart M. Bott M. Wilkinson A.J. Wilson K.S. The Corynebacterium glutamicum aconitase repressor. Scratching around for crystals.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) using 2 mm KAu(CN)2. Data were collected to 2.55 Å resolution on beamline ID14-1 at the ESRF and processed using HKL2000 (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The derivative was isomorphous with the Form I native. The structure was solved by SAD with SHELXC/D/E (42Sheldrick G.M. Experimental phasing with SHELXC/D/E.

Rebuilding and refinement were done with COOT (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5952) Google Scholar) to final Rwork/Rfree of 19.4/26.3%. The resulting model was used for the refinement of Form I and for molecular replacement using PHASER (46McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2052915368,"We establish a mathematical framework for studying immune interactions with Shigella, a bacteria that kills over one million people worldwide every year. The long-term goal of this novel approach is to inform Shigella vaccine design by elucidating which immune components and bacterial targets are crucial for establishing Shigella immunity. Our delay differential equation model focuses on antibody and B cell responses directed against antigens like lipopolysaccharide in Shigella’s outer membrane. We find that antibody-based vaccines targeting only surface antigens cannot elicit sufficient immunity for protection. Additional boosting prior to infection would require a four-orders-of-magnitude increase in antibodies to sufficiently prevent epithelial invasion. However, boosting anti-LPS B memory can confer protection, which suggests these cells may correlate with immunity. We see that IgA antibodies are slightly more effective per molecule than IgG, but more total IgA is required due to spatial functionality. An extension of the model reveals that targeting both LPS and epithelial entry proteins is a promising avenue to advance vaccine development. This paper underscores the importance of multifaceted immune targeting in creating an effective Shigella vaccine. It introduces mathematical models to the Shigella vaccine development effort and lays a foundation for joint theoretical/experimental/clinical approaches to Shigella vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W1965931395,"Mature B cells (BCs) express CD23 and B cell receptors. Whether activation of CD23 and B cell receptors has different effects on BC activities is unclear. This study aims to investigate the mechanism by which the specific antigen immunotherapy regulates the activation of BCs in the skewed Th2 responses. Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin. The specific antigen vaccination (SAV) at graded doses was employed to modulate the activities of BCs in which the expression of IL-10, IgE, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), CD23, and serum soluble CD23 by BCs was evaluated. The immune regulatory effect of BCs primed by lower or higher SAV doses was observed with an adoptive transfer mouse experiment. SAV activated CD23 to produce IL-10 in BCs at lower doses. The higher doses of SAV increased the expression of MMP9 in BCs that reduced the amounts of CD23 in BCs and increased the serum levels of soluble CD23, which was abrogated by the pretreatment with MMP9 inhibitor. Adoptively transfer with BCs primed by lower doses of SAV inhibited the ongoing antigen-specific Th2 responses whereas the BCs primed by higher doses of SAV exacerbated the ongoing Th2 responses. Exposure to specific antigens at optimal doses can activate BCs to produce IL-10 to suppress the skewed antigen-specific Th2 responses. The antigen doses of SAV higher than the optimal doses may promote the production of soluble CD23 to exacerbate the ongoing immune responses."
