In situ hybridization techniques were used to localize the 35-kilobase DNA of Toxoplasma gondii to a discrete organelle surrounded by four membranes. Phylogenetic analysis of the tufA gene encoded by the 35-kilobase genomes of coccidians T. gondii and Eimeria tenella and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum grouped this organellar genome with cyanobacteria and plastids, showing consistent clustering with green algal plastids. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Apicomplexa acquired a plastid by secondary endosymbiosis, probably from a green alga."

This repair could be accomplished with rhodium noncovalently bound to the duplex and at long range (16 to 26 angstroms), with the rhodium intercalator tethered to either end of the duplex assembly. This long-range repair was mediated by the DNA helix. Repair efficiency did not decrease with increasing distance between intercalated rhodium and the thymine dimer, but it diminished with disruption of the intervening π-stack."

The atomic structure of the bleached signaling intermediate in the light cycle of PYP was determined by millisecond time-resolved, multiwavelength Laue crystallography and simultaneous optical spectroscopy. Light-induced trans-to-cis isomerization of the 4-hydroxycinnamyl chromophore and coupled protein rearrangements produce a new set of active-site hydrogen bonds. An arginine gateway opens, allowing solvent exposure and protonation of the chromophore's phenolic oxygen. Resulting changes in shape, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic potential at the protein surface form a likely basis for signal transduction. The structural results suggest a general framework for the interpretation of protein photocycles."
https://openalex.org/W2063880942,"Cells infected with prions contain both prion protein isoforms cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) and scrapie prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is formed posttranslationally through the pathological refolding of PrP<sup>C</sup>. In scrapie-infected ScN2a cells, the metabolism of both PrP isoforms involves cholesterol-dependent pathways. We show here that both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are attached to Triton X-100-insoluble, low-density complexes or ""rafts."" These complexes are sensitive to saponin and thus probably contain cholesterol. This finding suggests that the transformation PrP<sup>C</sup>→ PrP<sup>Sc</sup> occurs within rafts. It also reveals the existence of rafts in late compartments of the endocytic pathway, where most PrP<sup>Sc</sup> resides. When Triton X-100 lysates of cells were incubated at 37°C prior to density analysis, PrP<sup>C</sup> was still found in buoyant complexes, although it now failed to sediment at high speed. This property was shared by another glycophosphatidyl inositol protein, Thy-1, and also by the raft resident GM1. In one ScN2a clone and in the brain of a Syrian hamster with scrapie, Triton X-100 extraction at 37°C permitted resolution of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> into two distinct peaks of different densities. This suggests that there are two populations of PrP-containing rafts and may permit isolation of PrP<sup>C</sup>-specific rafts from those containing PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Our findings reinforce the contention that rafts are involved in various aspects of PrP metabolism and in the ""life cycle"" of prions."

The latter is characterized by the development of hamartomas and occasional malignancies. Expression of the wild-type gene in TSC2 mutant tumor cells inhibits proliferation and tumorigenicity. This “suppressor− activity is encoded by functional domain(s) in the C terminus that contains homology to Rap1GAP. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify proteins that interact with the C-terminal domain of tuberin, the product of TSC2, a cytosolic factor, rabaptin-5, was found to associate with a distinct domain lying adjacent to the TSC2 GAP homology region. Rabaptin-5 also binds the active form of GTPase Rab5. Immune complexes of native tuberin, as well as recombinant protein, possessed activity to stimulate GTP hydrolysis of Rab5. Tuberin GAP activity was specific for Rab5 and showed no cross-reactivity with Rab3a or Rab6. Cells lacking tuberin possessed minimal Rab5GAP activity and were associated with an increased uptake of horseradish peroxidase. Re-expression of tuberin in TSC2 mutant cells reduced the rate of fluid-phase endocytosis.

The ∼190-kDa protein product, tuberin, is widely expressed and separates with the membrane/particulate (100,000 × g pellet) fraction (1Cell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 4Yeung R.S.

Immunofluoresence analysis has sublocalized the protein to the perinuclear region where it co-localized with Rap1 (12Wienecke R. Maize J.C. Shoarinejad F. Vass W.C. Reed J. Bonifacino J.S. Resau J.H. de Gunzburg J. Yeung R.S. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 913-923PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis has demonstrated in vitro GAP activity toward Rap1a, but the degree of stimulation of the intrinsic GTPase by tuberin is weak (11Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). While the physiologic significance of this activity in vivo remains undefined, it has been postulated that tuberin defective in its GAP activity could lead to the constitutive activation of Rap1a or other monomeric GTPase proteins which may result in deregulated mitogenic signaling in the target cells. Such a model would be analogous to the role of mutant neurofibromin in modulating Ras GTPase activity in schwannomas (13DeClue J.E. Papageorge A.G. Fletcher J.A. Diehl S.R. Ratner N. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Cell. 1992; 69: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).The Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins are central to a wide variety of cellular processes and are regulated by different classes of proteins that determine the “on-off− state of the GTPases. GAPs stimulate the intrinsic rate of GTPases and serve as negative regulators of these binary switches. Unique GAPs exist for specific families of GTPases and perhaps for each member of the family. Substrate specificity exhibited by GAP proteins appears quite stringent. The p120GAP specifically stimulates GTPase activities of Ha-Ras, N-Ras, Ki-Ras and R-Ras, but not those of Rho, Rac, or Rab (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Rap1a, a closely related member of Ras, can bind to p120GAP, but its GTPase activity is unaffected (15Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Proteins that activate GTPase of Rap1 include Rap1GAP, Spa1, and tuberin, but they share no similarity with p120GAP. To understand the mechanism of tuberin function, studies were undertaken to identify proteins that interact with the C-terminal fragment containing the GAP homology domain. Surprisingly, we identified a tuberin-binding molecule that associates with the small GTPase Rab5 and demonstrated specific GAP activity of tuberin toward Rab5. These findings have implications for tuberin function in the endocytic pathway.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe focused on the tuberin C-terminal region encompassing the GAP domain as a probe to identify potential binding molecules. An ∼1-kilobase BamHI fragment of the 3′ end of the rat TSC2 gene (nucleotides 4351-5352) was cloned into pJK202 as bait vector in a yeast two-hybrid system (16Golemis E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons,, New York1994: 13.14.1Google Scholar). Homology search of 4 positive, overlapping clones revealed identity with a partial human cDNA sequence of unknown function (GenBank™ accession number X77723) and a recently cloned gene, rabaptin-5 (GenBank™ accession number X91141). The latter was isolated independently from an “interaction− search in a yeast two-hybrid system using the GTP-bound Rab5 as bait (19Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Of the four partial rabaptin-5 clones identified in our screen, the smallest overlapping region corresponded to nucleotides 455-717 (amino acids 90-176) near the 5′ end of the gene. In contrast, Stenmark et al. (19Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) reported interaction of GTP-Rab5 with the C terminus of rabaptin-5 amino acids 551-862 (19Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thus there exist at least two protein-protein-binding domains in rabaptin-5. To define the structural requirement of tuberin for rabaptin-5 binding, deletion subclones of the LexA-TSC2 constructs were tested for β-galactosidase activity and leucine auxotrophy. The smallest region of overlap was mapped to a 59-amino acid fragment near the C terminus of tuberin amino acids 1668-1726 (Fig. 1). The TSC2-GAP homology domain lies adjacent but distinct from this region. Of significance, there exist at least two examples of missense mutations within this rabaptin-5-binding domain in two affected TSC individuals (20Wilson P.J. Ramesh V. Kristiansen A. Bove C. Jozwiak S. Kwiatkowski D.J. Short M.P. Haines J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).To further investigate in vivo tuberin-rabaptin-5 interaction in eukaryotic cells, binding assays were conducted following transient transfection in COS-7 cells and with endogenous proteins in human-derived cell lines. A polyclonal anti-rabaptin-5 antiserum, anti-B9, directed against the TSC2-binding domain of rabaptin-5 (residues 455-717) was used to immunoprecipitate lysate from COS-7 cells transfected with full-length rat TSC2 and/or partial rabaptin-5 cDNAs (data not shown). The resultant protein complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed on immunoblot developed with anti-tuberin antibody, anti-L3. The ∼190-kDa tuberin band co-purified with rabaptin-5 in cells transfected with both TSC2 and rabaptin-5 expression vectors and not when either one is omitted. The ability of endogenous tuberin to stably bind to rabaptin-5 was assessed in HeLa and CCL-136 (human sarcoma cell line, ATCC, Rockville, MD) cells. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-L3, and the products were analyzed for the presence of rabaptin-5 by immunoblot detection. The anti-L3 purified tuberin complexed to the 115-kDa rabaptin-5 that was not evident in the preimmune sera immunoprecipitate (data not shown). These results established that tuberin physically associates with rabaptin-5 in vivoAs a membrane-bound GTPase activating protein, tuberin may promote the hydrolysis of Rab5-GTP to its inactive GDP form via its interaction with rabaptin-5. To test this hypothesis, in vitro GAP activity of tuberin was examined using purified Rab5 as the substrate. Native tuberin immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells with anti-L3 showed substantial levels of GAP activity when incubated with [γ-32P]GTP-Rab5 (Fig. 2A). While the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rab5 in vitro was high as was previously shown (21Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 22Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the rate of GTP hydrolysis was further accelerated by the anti-L3 immunoprecipitate and not preimmune control (Fig. 2B). Tuberin GAP activity toward Rab5 was specific since no activation of GTPase activity was noted for Ras and other members of the Rab family including Rab3a and Rab6 (Fig. 2, C-E). GAP activity was also detected, albeit weaker, using purified recombinant GST-fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal region of tuberin, in the absence of rabaptin-5 (data not shown). This suggests that the latter is not required for GTPase activation and may function as an adapter protein to recruit Rab5-GTP to tuberin. Recent evidence reported that in the relative abundance of rabaptin-5, the rate of nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis by Rab5 in vitro was reduced (22Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the binding of excess amounts of rabaptin-5 to both Rab5 and tuberin might hinder the interaction between the GTPase and its GAP.Fig. 2Tuberin possesses specific GAP activity for Rab5. A, activation of Rab5 intrinsic GTPase activity by native tuberin was determined by nitrocellulose filter assay and expressed as the log10 fraction of GTP remaining bound to Rab5 as a function of time. ♦, buffer alone; ▪, immunoprecipitate of preimmune serum; ▴, native tuberin immunoprecipitated by anti-L3; X, HeLa cell lysate. B, analysis of the protein-bound nucleotide by thin layer chromatography showed that the [α-32P]GTP-bound Rab5 was hydrolyzed specifically to GDP. The percentages of bound GTP remaining after a 5-min incubation with buffer alone (lane 1), preimmune precipitate (lane 2), and native tuberin (lane 3) were determined by phosphorimage analysis and adjusted for the phosphorus content of GDP. In vitro GAP assay using native tuberin failed to show activity toward Ha-Ras (C), Rab3a (D), and Rab6 (E). Symbols as in A Different intrinsic GTPase activities were reflected in the slopes of each assay. Consistent results were obtained in two to three independent experiments. F, whole cell lysates of EEF4 (▪) and EEF8 (▴) were assayed for Rab5 GAP activity. EEF8 cells were deficient of endogenous tuberin (see Fig. 3B) and possessed minimal activity compared with buffer alone (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rap1a has been also implicated as a substrate for tuberin GAP activity in vitro, but the magnitude of activation is weak (11Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Under conditions of our assay, the observed GAP activity of tuberin on Rap1a was noted to a lesser extent than that of Rab5 (data not shown), suggesting that Rab5 may be the primary target for tuberin GAP function in HeLa cells. To determine the in vivo relevance of the observed Rab5GAP activity of tuberin, we examined the relative levels of GAP activity in cells with and without endogenous tuberin. The latter consisted of embryonic cultured cells derived from an Eker heterozygous mating. Total cell lysate from TSC2−/− embryo fibroblasts possessed minimal GAP activity toward Rab5 compared with TSC2-/- cell lysate (Fig. 2F); thus, total cellular Rab5GAP activity correlated with tuberin expression. The evidence for a biochemical interaction between tuberin, Rab5, and Rap1 highlights the unique substrate specificities of tuberin toward two dissimilar GTPases. This is surprising in light of the stringent specificity of GAP proteins. Rab5 and Rap1a belong to different families of the Ras-like GTPases and share only 33% identity. While Rab5 has a unique function in the endocytic pathway, the physiologic role of Rap1a is less well defined. However, both Rab5 and Rap1 have been detected in endosomal compartments (Rap1 also resides in the Golgi) and is consistent with the perinuclear localization of tuberin (12Wienecke R. Maize J.C. Shoarinejad F. Vass W.C. Reed J. Bonifacino J.S. Resau J.H. de Gunzburg J. Yeung R.S. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 913-923PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 24Pizon V. Desjardins M. Bucci C. Parton R.G. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1661-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest a potential role of TSC2 product in the regulation of endocytosis.The Rab5 GTPase is a critical and rate-limiting component of the docking and fusion process of the endocytic pathway (23Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). This suggests that proteins governing the nucleotide-bound state of Rab5 (e.g. guanine dissociation inhibitors, guanine exchange factors, and GAPs) may have a regulatory role in endocytosis. To assess the potential function of tuberin in vesicular transport, we examined the effects of endogenous TSC2 gene expression in fluid-phase HRP uptake in TSC2 mutant cells derived from the Eker rat. Upon transient exposure to HRP (5 mg/ml), embryo fibroblasts from TSC2−/− fetuses endocytosed significantly greater amounts of HRP in vitro compared with those of TSC2-/- genotype (Fig. 3A). These cells, while differing in tuberin protein levels, expressed equal amounts of Rab5 and rabaptin-5 (Fig. 3B). This finding, in conjunction with the contrasting endogenous GAP activities for Rab5 of these two cell lines (see Fig. 2F), is consistent with a negative regulatory role of tuberin on Rab5 activity in vivo Furthermore, in transient transfection studies, tuberin re-expression in TSC2−/− tumor cells reduced the rate of HRP uptake (data not shown). It remains to be defined which process tuberin mediates during endocytosis.Fig. 3Tuberin reduces the rate of fluid-phase endocytosis. A, internalization of HRP in Eker rat-derived embryo fibroblasts, EEF4 (TSC2-/-) was compared with that of EEF8 (TSC2−/−), following a 1-h exposure. Results (absorbance at A455/mg of protein) were normalized to HeLa controls and expressed as the mean ± S.D. from two independent experiments with duplicate samples. B, both cell lines expressed equal amounts of Rab5 and rabaptin-5, but only EEF4 expressed tuberin. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with indicated antibodies (anti-L3 for TSC2; anti-B9 for rabaptin-5; 4F11 monoclonal antibody for Rab5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intracellular trafficking is highly specific and directional. It has been postulated that unique sets of effectors may exist for individual Rab proteins to account for the required specificity. Our findings have identified tuberin as a protein with substantial Rab5-GAP activity and demonstrated that tuberin association with Rab5 is mediated by an intermediate adapter-like molecule, rabaptin-5. These data add to the current model of the early endocytic pathway in which a Rab5-GTP bound vesicle recruits rabaptin-5 to the cytosolic surface of the membrane. This, in turn, targets the vesicle to a tuberin-bound organelle where proper docking and fusion can take place. A second function of tuberin is to stimulate hydrolysis of Rab5-GTP, thereby releasing the GDP-Rab5 and rabaptin-5 into the cytosol for recycling. The specificity of this interaction is governed by at least two mechanisms. Rabaptin-5 displays specific binding for Rab5 and not other related GTPases (19Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and secondly, tuberin GAP activity does not cross-react with other Rab-GTPases besides Rab5. Thus, the functional interplay between Rab5, rabaptin-5, and tuberin provides one level of specificity that may operate in concert with the SNAP receptors to ensure compartment-specific docking. Recent evidence suggested that while Rab5 is necessary for early endosome fusion, GTP hydrolysis by Rab5 is not required in this process, but rather the fusion reaction is dependent on certain cytosolic factors (22Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Whether the Rab5-rabaptin-5-tuberin association is sufficient for vesicle docking is not known, but tuberin is capable of interacting with other proteins that may serve as additional components of the fusion machinery. 2R. S. Yeung, unpublished observation. This is consistent with fractionation data suggesting that rabaptin-5 may exist in a high molecular weight multi-protein complex (19Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which a tumor suppressor gene, such as TSC2, causes the development of hamartoma and neoplasia based on its effects on protein trafficking remains speculative. One hypothesis is to suggest that the loss of tuberin Rab5GAP activity would interfere with the docking, fusion, and processing of the Rab5-GTP-associated early endosomes. Perturbation of the endocytic pathway could lead to missorting of internalized growth factor receptors or other signal-mediated membrane-bound molecules that would otherwise undergo lysosomal degradation. For example, cells expressing non-internalizing epidermal growth factor receptors behaved in ways similar to transformed cells (25Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also points to the critical role of endocytic trafficking not only in down-regulating epidermal growth factor receptor signaling but also in controlling specific signaling pathways (26Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if tuberin dysfunction could lead to aberrant turnover of ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinases during tumorigenesis. The relative importance of Rab5GAP and Rap1GAP activities in governing TSC2-related tumor suppression is yet to be defined.

While the physiologic significance of this activity in vivo remains undefined, it has been postulated that tuberin defective in its GAP activity could lead to the constitutive activation of Rap1a or other monomeric GTPase proteins which may result in deregulated mitogenic signaling in the target cells. Such a model would be analogous to the role of mutant neurofibromin in modulating Ras GTPase activity in schwannomas (13DeClue J.E. Papageorge A.G. Fletcher J.A. Diehl S.R. Ratner N. Vass W.C.

GAPs stimulate the intrinsic rate of GTPases and serve as negative regulators of these binary switches. Unique GAPs exist for specific families of GTPases and perhaps for each member of the family. Substrate specificity exhibited by GAP proteins appears quite stringent. The p120GAP specifically stimulates GTPase activities of Ha-Ras, N-Ras, Ki-Ras and R-Ras, but not those of Rho, Rac, or Rab (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

It is shown here by genetic and biochemical analysis that translation, rather than splicing, is severely impaired in two newly isolated ded1 conditional mutants. Preliminary evidence suggests that the protein Ded1p may be required for the initiation step of translation, as is the distinct DEAD-box protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). The DED1 gene could be functionally replaced by a mouse homolog, PL10 , which suggests that the function of Ded1p in translation is evolutionarily conserved."

A PP1C-targeting protein expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (called PTG, for protein targeting to glycogen) was cloned and characterized. PTG was expressed predominantly in insulin-sensitive tissues. In addition to binding and localizing PP1C to glycogen, PTG formed complexes with phosphorylase kinase, phosphorylase a, and glycogen synthase, the primary enzymes involved in the hormonal regulation of glycogen metabolism. Overexpression of PTG markedly increased basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the insulin receptor, which do not express endogenous PTG. These results suggest that PTG is critical for glycogen metabolism, possibly functioning as a molecular scaffold."

The dual specificity mitogen-actived protein (MAP) kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) activates ERK1/2 in response to angII, but the MEK activating kinases remain undefined. Raf is a candidate MEK kinase. However, a kinase other than Raf appears responsible for angII-mediated signal transduction because we showed previously that treatment with 1 μM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) for 24 h completely blocked Raf-Ras association in VSMC but did not inhibit activation of MEK and ERK1/2 by angII. We hypothesized that an atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, which lacks a phorbol ester binding domain, mediated ERK1/2 activation by angII. Western blot analysis of rat aortic VSMC with PKC isoform-specific antibodies showed PKC-α, -β1, -Δ, -ϵ, and -η in relative abundance.

Infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with HIV-1 in vitro resulted in increased interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion in response to T cell activation via the CD3 and CD28 receptors. Expression of the HIV-1 transactivator Tat recapitulated this phenotype and was associated with increased IL-2 secretion in response to costimulation with CD3 plus CD28. IL-2 superinduction by Tat occurred at the transcriptional level, was mediated by the CD28-responsive element in the IL-2 promoter, and was exclusively dependent on the 29 amino acids encoded by the second exon of Tat."
https://openalex.org/W2150158001,"We have previously identified three mammalian Sec1/Munc-18 homologues in adipocytes (Tellam, J. T., McIntosh, S., and James, D. E. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5857-5863). These proteins are thought to modulate the interaction between vesicle membrane and target membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and thus regulate intracellular vesicular transport. This study aimed to further characterize these Munc-18 isoforms and to define their potential role in the trafficking of GLUT-4 in adipocytes, a process reported to involve the vesicle membrane SNARE, VAMP-2. Using an in vitro binding assay with recombinant fusion proteins, we show that Munc-18a and Munc-18b bind to syntaxin-1A, −2, and −3, while Munc-18c binds only to syntaxin-2 and −4. The specific interaction between Munc-18c and syntaxin-4 is of interest because aside from syntaxin-1A, which is not expressed in adipocytes, syntaxin-4 is the only syntaxin that binds to VAMP-2. Using a three-way binding assay, it was shown that Munc-18c inhibits the binding of syntaxin-4 to VAMP-2. The subcellular distribution of syntaxin-4 and Munc-18c was almost identical, both being enriched in the plasma membrane, and both exhibiting an insulin-dependent movement out of an intracellular membrane fraction similar to that observed for GLUT-4. Munc-18b had a similar distribution to Munc-18c and so may also be involved in vesicle transport to the cell surface, whereas Munc-18a was undetectable by immunoblotting in adipocytes. Microinjection of a syntaxin-4 antibody into 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocked the insulin-dependent recruitment of GLUT-4 to the cell surface. These data suggest that syntaxin-4/Munc-18c/VAMP-2 may play a role in the docking/fusion of intracellular GLUT-4-containing vesicles with the cell surface in adipocytes. We have previously identified three mammalian Sec1/Munc-18 homologues in adipocytes (Tellam, J. T., McIntosh, S., and James, D. E. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5857-5863).

INTRODUCTIONIn adipose tissue and muscle, the glucose transporter isoform 4, GLUT-4, is translocated from an intracellular vesicular pool to the cell surface in response to insulin (1Cushman S.W.

To understand the molecular mechanisms governing this vesicular transport system, it will be necessary to identify and characterize the individual components of the trafficking machinery. The SNARE hypothesis (reviewed in Ref. 3Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr.

This complex may facilitate the docking and/or fusion of distinct membrane compartments, the specificity being provided by the pairing of unique v- and t-SNAREs at different loci throughout the cell. Each of the SNAREs belong to large gene families. For example, in mammalian cells seven different syntaxins (4Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D.

Syntaxin-1A, a t-SNARE enriched in the neuronal presynaptic membrane, binds with high affinity to VAMP-2, which is found in synaptic vesicles (16Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, syntaxin-5, which appears to facilitate membrane traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (4Bennett M.K.

Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), does not interact with VAMP-2.Several other protein families regulate the interaction between v- and t-SNAREs. One of these, the Sec1-like family, modulates the assembly of v-and t-SNAREs by competitively binding to the t-SNARE protein. Loss of SEC1 function in yeast blocks the fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane (17Novick P. Ferro S. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Several mammalian Sec1-like proteins, referred to as Munc-18, have been identified (18Hata Y. Slaughter C.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Munc-18a is expressed at high levels in the brain and competes with VAMP-2 for binding to syntaxin-1A (25Pevsner J. Hsu S. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In view of the large number of Sec1-like proteins described in other eucaryotes and their putative role in regulating different vesicle transport steps, we set out to identify Sec1-like proteins that may be involved in GLUT-4 trafficking in adipocytes. Two new Munc-18 isoforms (Munc-18b and Munc-18c) were identified (22Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar–24Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), both of which were ubiquitously expressed. However, the role of these new isoforms in regulating vesicle transport has not been established and their syntaxin binding specificities have not been compared.The expression of different SNAREs in insulin-sensitive cell types and their role in GLUT-4 translocation has only recently been addressed. Adipocytes and muscle cells express VAMP-2 (10Volchuk A. Mitsumoto Y. He L. Lui Z. Habermann E. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar–12Ralston E. Beushausen S. Ploug T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15403-15406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cellubrevin (10Volchuk A. Mitsumoto Y. He L. Lui Z. Habermann E. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both of these synaptobrevin isoforms co-localize with intracellular GLUT-4 and, like GLUT-4, undergo insulin-dependent movement to the cell surface (11Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Using immunoelectron microscopy on vesicles isolated from adipocytes and an endosomal ablation technique, it has been shown that the majority of cellubrevin co-localizes with approximately 40% of intracellular GLUT-4 in endosomes (26Martin S. Tellam J. Livington C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The remaining GLUT-4, together with the majority of VAMP-2 appears to be targeted to a post-endocytic compartment, the function of which remains to be determined (26Martin S. Tellam J. Livington C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, it is of considerable interest to determine the cognate t-SNAREs, particularly for VAMP-2, as this may provide some clue as to how insulin regulates the exocytosis of GLUT-4.In the present study we provide evidence that syntaxin-4 and Munc-18c may play a role in regulating the trafficking of GLUT-4 in adipocytes. In vitro studies show that Munc-18 isoforms display unique syntaxin binding specificities. Most importantly, Munc-18c bound very strongly to syntaxin-4, one of the t-SNAREs previously identified in insulin-responsive tissues (27Volchuk A. Wang Q.H. Ewart H.S. Liu Z. He L.J. Bennett M.K.

Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Using specific antisera against these proteins, we show that Munc-18c and syntaxin-4 have a similar subcellular distribution in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and both proteins exhibit insulin-dependent movement out of the intracellular membrane fraction that is highly enriched in GLUT-4. Microinjection of a syntaxin-4-specific antibody into 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocked insulin-stimulated movement of GLUT-4. These data, combined with the ability of Munc-18c to impair the interaction between syntaxin-4 and VAMP-2 in vitro, implicate these proteins in GLUT-4 trafficking in adipocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. Radioactive nucleotides, nylon membranes (Hybond-N+), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kits were from Amersham (Aylesbury, United Kingdom). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA synthesizer. All tissue culture reagents and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc., with the exception of fetal calf serum, which was from Commonwealth Serum Laboratories CSL (Australia). Polyvinylidene difluoride blotting membranes were from Millipore. BCA protein reagent was from Pierce. Glutathione-agarose beads were from Sigma and Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were from Qiagen. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody was purchased from The Binding Site (Birmingham, United Kingdom). Thrombin was purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were of high purity commercial grade.cDNA Cloning of 3T3-L1 Syntaxin-4Rat syntaxin-1A, −2, −3, and −4 cDNA clones, generously provided by Dr. Richard Scheller (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), were radiolabeled with random hexamer primers (Promega Corp.) and used to screen a random-primed 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library constructed in Λ ZAP II, kindly provided by Dr. F. Fiedorek, University of North Carolina. A total of 200,000 plaques were initially screened with a 1.2-kilobase rat syntaxin-1A DNA fragment probe. Six positive clones were isolated, characterized by DNA sequencing, and shown to be identical to rat syntaxin-4. In an effort to isolate other syntaxin isoforms, a further screen was performed using a mixed cDNA probe comprising full-length cDNA inserts encompassing syntaxin-2, −3, and −4. Seven positive clones were isolated. The 13 positive clones isolated after sequential purifications were subcloned into pBluescript II SK and the inserts sequenced as described previously (22Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All 13 clones were identical to mammalian syntaxin-4. Most of the clones contained the entire syntaxin-4 open reading frame, and one clone was sequenced entirely in both strands.RNA Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from rat tissues, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, and adipocytes by the guanidine isothiocyanate procedure (29Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 fibroblast and adipocyte poly(A)+ was obtained using the Pharmacia mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Northern blots were probed with a 3T3-L1 syntaxin-4 DNA fragment labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. The hybridization conditions were: 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA at 42°C for 16 h. The blot was washed with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50°C. The RNA blots were also probed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe as an internal control.Cell Culture3T3-L1 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (30Frost S.C.

Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments used adipocytes 10-14 days after initiation of differentiation. CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 units/liter penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were passaged at subconfluence.Munc-18b and Munc-18c Constructs in CHO CellsRecombinant Munc-18b and Munc-18c cDNA constructs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pMEXneo (kindly provided by Dr. E Santos, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (31Benito M. Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and were transiently transfected into subconfluent CHO cells using LipofectAMINE, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested after 48 h, scraped in Hepes buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA and 250 mM sucrose (HES), lysed using a 1-ml syringe and 27-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 208,000 × g for 30 min in a TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman) to pellet total cellular membranes. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS in HES buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies specific for either Munc-18b or Munc-18c.AntibodiesRecombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-syntaxin-4 (amino acids 5-274) was expressed in bacteria and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (32Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar), followed by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column. The GST-syntaxin-4 fusion protein (Mr = 59,000) was injected into rabbits with Montanide ISA-70 as adjuvant and again 4 weeks later. The rabbit received a total of 200 μg of GST-syntaxin-4 and was bled 2 weeks after the second injection. A synthetic peptide corresponding to a unique region near the NH2 terminus of syntaxin-4 (amino acids 20-38, CKERVALVVHPGTARLGSPD) that included a cysteine linker was coupled to BSA and injected into mice for production of monoclonal antibodies. An IgM antibody, which reacted specifically with recombinant syntaxin-4, was generated and purified using anti-mouse IgM (Selenus, Melbourne, Australia) coupled to a Mini-Leak™ low kit (Kem-En-Tec, Copenhagen, Denmark) support. Synthetic peptides corresponding to unique regions within each Munc-18 isoform, the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of Munc-18b (CTLDQKLEGVALP) and the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of Munc-18c (CMLNKSKDKVSFKDE), and to the amino-terminal 12 amino acids of cellubrevin (STGVPSGSSAATC) and all including cysteine linkers, were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin according to standard procedures (33Green N. Alexander H. Olsen A. Alexander S. Schinnick T.M. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and injected into rabbits for antibody production. Antibodies were affinity-purified using the peptide antigen conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and coupled to Sepharose beads (ImmunoPure Ag/Ab Immobilization Kit 2, Pierce).Subcellular Fractionation of 3T3-L1 AdipocytesTwo separate methods were employed to determine the subcellular distribution of syntaxin-4 and Munc-18 isoforms in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Differential CentrifugationSubcellular membrane fractions were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes using a differential centrifugation protocol (34Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260Crossref Google Scholar). Four separate membrane fractions were obtained, and designated as plasma membranes (PM), low density microsomes (LDM), high density microsomes (HDM), and mitochondria/nuclei (M/N). The protein content of all fractions was measured using the Pierce BCA reagent.Plasma Membrane Lawn AssayPlasma membrane fragments were prepared from basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes as described previously (35Robinson L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263Google Scholar, 36Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Fragments were immunolabeled with an anti-GLUT-4 polyclonal serum (43James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:500, syntaxin-4 serum (1:750 dilution), or anti-Munc-18c (10 μg of protein/ml) affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibody (25 μg/ml). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides (34Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260Crossref Google Scholar) and visualized with a 63×/1.40 Zeiss oil immersion lens using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). In some cases labeling of plasma membrane fragments was quantified as described previously (36Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Microinjection of 3T3-L1 Cells3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured on glass coverslips were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), containing 2 mM pyruvate, 0.5% BSA, and 2.5 mM glucose for 45 min prior to microinjection. All of the cells located within a corner of a 3-mm2 grid (approximately 300 cells), located on the upper side of the coverslip, were microinjected with antibodies over a 45-min period using a Zeiss automated injection system coupled to an Eppendorf microinjector. The immunopurified anti-syntaxin-4 or control antibodies (an irrelevant IgG or IgM), each at 0.2 mg/ml were dissolved in a buffer containing 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 100 mM KCl for microinjection. Cells were transferred into fresh medium and allowed to recover for 90 min following injection, prior to incubation with insulin (100 nM) for 15 min. GLUT-4 levels in individual plasma membranes of cells located within the gridded area were quantified using the plasma membrane lawn assay as described previously (36Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma membrane lawns were visualized and imaged using a Bio-Rad Lasersharp MRC-500 confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscope under a 40× objective for quantitation. Images were enhanced and relative intensities were scaled using the Bio-Rad COMOS confocal imaging software where identical gain settings were used for each experiment. Lawns from at least 24 cells were quantitated for each image, and at least five different fields for each coverslip were quantitated. Values were then averaged to obtain a single data point for each experimental condition.SDS-PAGE and ImmunoblottingSubcellular membrane fractions (20 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10 or 12% polyacrylamide resolving gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with GST-syntaxin-4 antiserum (1:750 dilution) or affinity-purified Munc-18b antibody (10 μg of protein/ml), affinity-purified Munc-18c antibody (10 μg of protein/ml), affinity-purified VAMP-2 antibody (10 μg of protein/ml), or cellubrevin antiserum (1:2000 dilution). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 (ECL kit). Autoradiograms were quantitated using a model GS-670 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad).Purification of His6-tagged Munc-18cA full-length Munc-18c cDNA construct was generated by PCR using t . vvbZ. jhe vector T3 primer and an oligonucleotide encompassing an XhoI restriction site and 15 nucleotides of overlapping sequence of the 5′ coding region of a 3T3-L1 Munc-18c cDNA cloned into pBluescript II KG (22Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The PCR cycling profile was 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for 40 s, 72°C for 2 min, repeated for 35 cycles. The PCR product was digested with XhoI-EcoRI, and the ∼2.2-kilobase fragment was subcloned into the XhoI-EcoRI sites of pRSETA to generate the plasmid pMunc-18c-His6. A large bacterial culture (E. coli BL21) (DE3) was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 5 h, and the Munc-18c-His6 protein was purified using a Qiagen nickel resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Munc-18c-His6 protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80°C.Purification of Recombinant Fusion ProteinsGST fusion proteins incorporating the full cytoplasmic domains of rat syntaxin-1A, −2, −3, and −4 and rat VAMP-2 were prepared as described (16Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 38Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-cellubrevin was produced by inserting the HindIII/EcoRI PCR fragment, incorporating the full cytoplasmic domain of a 3T3-L1 cellubrevin cDNA clone 3A (22Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) into the pGEX-KG vector. The oligonucleotides used to generate the cytoplasmic domain of cellubrevin (amino acid residues 1-80) were 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATGTCTACAGGTGTGCCTTCG-3′ sense primer and 5′-GCCCAAGCTTTTACTTGCAGTTCTTCCACCAATAC-3′ antisense primer. The cytoplasmic tails of the four syntaxin isoforms 1A, 2, 3, and 4, VAMP-2, and cellubrevin were isolated from GST using thrombin (6 units/ml) in cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mM calcium chloride).In Vitro Binding Assays3T3-L1 Munc-18a and Munc-18b cDNA in pBluescript KG (22Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were transcribed and translated in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase using a coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine (ICN). Lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled Munc-18a, Munc-18b, or Munc-18c translation reactions (10 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with GST, GST-syntaxin-1A, GST-syntaxin-2, GST-syntaxin-3, or GST-syntaxin-4 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% BSA. The concentration of the fusion proteins used in these reactions was 25 μg/ml. Glutathione-agarose beads (15 μl) were added and the mixture incubated for another 30 min at 4°C. The beads were washed three times by brief centrifugation in phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C. Washed beads were then incubated for 5 min with Laemmli sample buffer (20 μl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed, incubated with 1 M sodium salicylate, 0.5% glycerol, dried, and subjected to autoradiography.To assess whether Munc-18c inhibits the in vitro binding interaction between syntaxin-4 and VAMP-2, GST alone, GST-syntaxin-1A (2 μg), and GST-syntaxin-4 (2 μg) were incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant Munc-18c-His6 (10 μg) for 1 h at 4°C. Thrombin-cleaved recombinant-VAMP-2 (10 μg) was added to each sample and the incubation continued for another 45 min at 4°C. Glutathione-agarose beads (15 μl) were then added to each sample and the mixture rotated at 4°C for 30 min. The beads were washed as described above, subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the VAMP-2-specific antibody. This experiment was repeated to study the binding of thrombin-cleaved recombinant-cellubrevin (10 μg) to syntaxin-1A (0.5 μg) and syntaxin-4 (5 μg) in the presence or absence of recombinant Munc-18c-His6 (10 μg).RESULTSA major goal of these studies was to identify SNAREs that may interact with the syntaxin-binding protein VAMP-2 in adipocytes, because this v-SNARE has been suggested to play a role in GLUT-4 trafficking (Refs. 26Martin S.

Telomeres are now shown to have a role in chromosome separation during mitosis. In telomeric DNA mutants of Tetrahymena thermophila , created by expression of a telomerase RNA with an altered template sequence, division of the germline nucleus was severely delayed or blocked in anaphase. The mutant chromatids failed to separate completely at the midzone, becoming stretched to up to twice their normal length. These results suggest a physical block in mutant telomere separation."
https://openalex.org/W2085901479,"Escherichia coli strains expressing the marine bacteria (Agrobacterium aurantiacum and Alcaligenes sp. strain PC-1) astaxanthin biosynthetic genes (crtZ and W), Haematococcus pluvialis bkt, and Erwinia uredovora crtZ genes were used for in vitro characterization of the respective enzymes. Specific enzyme assays indicated that all of the enzymes are bifunctional, in that the CrtZ enzymes formed zeaxanthin from β-carotene via β-cryptoxanthin, as well as astaxanthin from canthaxanthin via phoenicoxanthin (adonirubin). The BKT/CrtW enzymes synthesized canthaxanthin via echinenone from β-carotene and 4-ketozeaxanthin (adonixanthin) with trace amounts of astaxanthin from zeaxanthin. Comparison of maximum catalytic activities as well as selectivity experiments carried out in the presence of both utilizable substrates indicated that the CrtZ enzymes from marine bacteria converted canthaxanthin to astaxanthin preferentially, whereas the Erwinia CrtZ possessed a favorability to the formation of zeaxanthin from β-carotene. The CrtW/BKT enzymes were not so defined in their substrate preference, responding readily to fluctuations in substrate levels. Other properties obtained indicated that the enzymes were strictly oxygen-requiring; and a cofactor mixture of 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbic acid, and Fe2- was beneficial to activity. Based on enzymological data, a predicted pathway for astaxanthin biosynthesis is described, and it is proposed that CrtZ-like enzymes be termed carotenoid 3,(3′)-β-ionone ring hydroxylase and CrtW/BKT carotenoid 4,(4′)-β-ionone ring oxygenase. Escherichia coli strains expressing the marine bacteria (Agrobacterium aurantiacum and Alcaligenes sp. strain PC-1) astaxanthin biosynthetic genes (crtZ and W), Haematococcus pluvialis bkt, and Erwinia uredovora crtZ genes were used for in vitro characterization of the respective enzymes.

Astaxanthin (3,3′-dihydroxy-β,β-carotene-4,4′-dione) is the most commonly found carotenoid pigment in marine animals (1Matsuno T. Krinsky N.I. Mathews-Roth M.M. Taylor F. Carotenoids: Chemistry and Biology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 59-74Crossref Google Scholar). It is responsible for the red/pink coloration of crustaceans (1Matsuno T. Krinsky N.I. Mathews-Roth M.M. Taylor F. Carotenoids: Chemistry and Biology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 59-74Crossref Google Scholar), shellfish (2Renstrom B. Borch G. Liaaen-Jensen S. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1981; 64: 449-453Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the flesh of salmonoids (3Torrissen O.J. Hardy R.W. Shearer K.D. Crit. Rev. Aquatic Sci. 1989; 1: 209-213Google Scholar). Despite high endogenous levels, these marine animals do not possess the ability to synthesize astaxanthin or other carotenoid pigments de novo Instead carotenoid pigments must be acquired via their diet (4Miki W. Otaki N. Yokoyama A. Izumida H. Shimidzu N. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 684-686Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Industrially, astaxanthin has been exploited as a feed supplement for cultured fish and shellfish (5Fujita T. Satake M. Watanabe T. Kitajima C. Takeda M. Shimeno S. Kuwabara H. Miki W. Yamaguchi K. Konosu S. Bull. Japan. Soc. Sci. Fish. 1983; 49: 1855-1861Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Johnson E.A. An G.H. Crit. Rev.

Other diverse biological functions of astaxanthin include an involvement in cancer prevention (8Tanaka T. Morishita Y. Suzui M. Kojima T. Okumura A. Mori H. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), enhancer of immune responses (9Jyonouchi H. Zhang L. Tomita Y. Nutr. Cancer. 1993; 19: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a free radical quencher (10Miki W. Otaki N. Shimidzu N. Yokoyama A. J. Mar. Biotechnol. 1994; 2: 35-37Google Scholar, 11Miki W. Pure Appl. Chem. 1991; 63: 141-146Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar). It is evident, therefore, that astaxanthin is a molecule with potential both to the pharmaceutical and food industries. Astaxanthin belongs to the class of compounds known as xanthophylls. These are carotenoids modified with oxygen-containing functional groups. Xanthophylls are found universally in chloroplast-containing plant tissues. However, the biosynthesis of astaxanthin is limited in a virtually exclusive manner to microorganisms, for example, the yeast Phaffia rhodozyma (12Andrewes A.G. Phaff H.J. Starr M.P. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 1003-1007Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the freshwater alga Haematococcus pluvialis (13Boussiba S. Vonshak A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 1077-1082Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and the marine bacteria Agrobacterium aurantiacum and Alcaligenes sp. strain PC-1 (14Yokoyama A. Izumida H. Miki W. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1842-1844Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently the genes involved in the formation of astaxanthin and its intermediates have been isolated and functionally characterized in vivo by complementation, providing the first insight into the biosynthetic route (15Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The pathway proposed (Fig. 1) is based on the lack of enzyme specificity surmised from complementation studies (15Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation of β-carotene at positions 3 and 3′ on the β-ionone ring forming zeaxanthin via β-cryptoxanthin is mediated by the product of the gene designated crtZ, which has been isolated from Erwinia species (16Misawa N. Nakagawa M. Kobayashi K. Yamano S. Izawa Y. Nakamura K. Harashima K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6704-6712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hundle B.S. O'Brien D.A. Beyer P. Kleinig H. Hearst J.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and marine bacteria (15Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The direct conversion of methylene to keto groups at positions 4 and 4′ on the β-ionone ring forming canthaxanthin via echinenone are reactions performed by the gene product encoded by the crtW gene from marine bacteria (18Misawa N. Kajiwara S. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Satomi Y. Saito T. Miki W. Ohtani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and bkt gene of H. pluvialis (19Kajiwara S. Kakizono T. Saito T. Kondo K. Ohtani T. Nishio N. Nagi S. Misawa N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicates the existence of 90% identity between the marine bacteria A. aurantiacum and Alcaligenes PC-1 CrtZ, which in turn show 54% identity with the Erwinia species. The CrtW proteins possess a 75% identity among the marine bacteria species, whereas a 37% identity is evident when compared with the BKT gene product of H. pluvialis When combinations of the gene products responsible for the introduction of the hydroxyl moieties at positions 3,3′ and formation of keto groups at 4,4′ positions on the β-ionone ring are expressed in Escherichia coli, astaxanthin as well as substantial quantities of various intermediates are synthesized (15Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Because of the limitations of in vivo complementation, the bifunctional character of the CrtZ and/or CrtW type gene products has not been ascertained conclusively. Thus it remains unclear whether CrtZ can convert canthaxanthin to astaxanthin via phoenicoxanthin (adonirubin) or CrtW can convert zeaxanthin to astaxanthin via 4-ketozeaxanthin (adonixanthin). At present no specific in vitro assay systems, cofactor requirements, or properties of the enzymes originating from an astaxanthin-forming organism have been reported. Advances in carotenoid enzymology have, however, been hindered by the practical difficulties associated with their assay (20Bramley P.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1985; 21: 243-279Crossref Google Scholar, 21Fraser P.D. de las Rivas J. Mackenzie A. Bramley P.M. Phytochemistry. 1991; 22: 441-445Google Scholar). The heterologous expression of the recently isolated astaxanthin biosynthetic genes in E. coli has provided a valuable opportunity to study the respective enzymes. In this article the in vitro characterization of the marine bacteria CrtZ and CrtW enzymes specific to astaxanthin biosynthesis are reported for the first time as well as a comparison with the Erwinia CrtZ and Haematococcus BKT. Plasmids pCAR16ΔcrtX and pCAR25ΔcrtX, corresponding to pCAR16delB and pCAR25delB (16Misawa N. Nakagawa M. Kobayashi K. Yamano S. Izawa Y. Nakamura K. Harashima K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6704-6712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contain the Erwinia uredovora genes for the synthesis of β-carotene and zeaxanthin, respectively. pACCAR16ΔcrtX has been described (18Misawa N.

Plasmids pAK916 and pAK96NK, which contain the A. aurantiacum crtW and crtZ genes, respectively, were described previously (15Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T.

The E. coli strains were grown in 2 × YT medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing the appropriate additions as described below. In all cases an initial overnight culture (5 ml) was prepared from a glycerol stock. An aliquot constituting 1% by volume of the fresh culture medium was used to inoculate cultures for induction. These cultures contained 0.1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and the following antibiotics depending on the recombinant strain. Strains used and antibiotic requirements follow. E. coli JM109 containing plasmids pCAR16ΔcrtX, pCAR25ΔcrtX, pCRT-Z, pAK916, pAK96NK, pPC17-3, pPC13, and pUCBKT required ampicillin at a final concentration of 150 μg/ml. E. coli JM101 containing pACCAR16ΔcrtX and pAK916, which synthesized canthaxanthin (18Misawa N. Kajiwara S. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Satomi Y. Saito T. Miki W. Ohtani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), required ampicillin (150 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml). All E. coli strains were grown at 30°C and shaken at 200 rpm. Marine bacteria A. aurantiacum and Alcaligenes PC-1 were grown in Sakagachi flasks (Eagleglass, Tokyo) containing 150 ml of marine broth (Difco). Culture vessels were shaken (164 rpm) at 20°C for 4 days under diffuse light. Recombinant E. coli extracts were prepared from cells induced for 4 or 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g Pelleted cells were placed on ice and resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, protease mixture (0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) as well as 5% glycerol v/v. The suspension was passed through a French press cell at a internal pressure of 500 p.s.i. DNase (50 μg) was added to the broken extract, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. The crude extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris. When determining cofactor requirements the supernatant was desalted with a PD10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Incubations were carried out in a total volume of 800 μl. Typically 400 μl of the substrate extract of E. coli producing β-carotene, canthaxanthin, or zeaxanthin was added (the precise volume varied depending on the quantity of substrate supplied). An equal volume of the E. coli extract to be analyzed was also added. The remaining 200 μl was buffered with 0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% v/v Tween 60, 3 mM ATP, 0.5 mM FeSO4, 0.5 mM 2-oxoglutarate, 5 mM ascorbic acid. The presence of 1 mg/ml catalase was optional. The mixture was incubated by shaking in the dark for 4 h at 30°C. When performing incubations with both utilizable substrates the mixture could be boiled for 30 s to remove any endogenous activities. Incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol and stored at −70°C under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Anaerobic incubations were performed in Thunberg tubes (23Sandmann G. Bramley P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 843: 73-77Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Extracts and incubation mixture were degassed under vacuum then purged with nitrogen gas prior to sealing. Control incubations were performed simultaneously in all experiments. They were identical apart from the presence of an E. coli extract from a non-crtZ or crtW expressing strain, as well as incubations containing heat-denatured (boiled 1 min) enzyme preparations. Carotenoid standards were extracted and purified from recombinant E. coli strains and A. aurantiacum using general carotenoid methodology as described (24Britton G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 113-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Products and substrates from the in vitro incubations were extracted with 10% (v/v) diethyl ether in petroleum ether 40-60°C (3 volumes). After mixing, a partition was formed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The organic phase was removed and aqueous phase reextracted with the same solvent. The remaining aqueous phase was further reextracted with chloroform (2 volumes). The organic extracts were pooled and brought to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Carotenoids formed in vitro were separated by HPLC 1The abbreviation used is: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. on a reversed phase C18 column (Nova-pak HR 6 μ C18, 3.9 × 300 mm, Waters) using an isocratic mobile phase of acetonitrile/methanol/isopropyl alcohol (90:6:40, v/v/v). On-line photodiode array detection enabled peak identification by comparison of spectral data with authentic standards (24Britton G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 113-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Retention times and λmax, respectively, are as follows: astaxanthin, 5.31 min, 480 nm; 4-ketozeaxanthin, 5.96 min, 465 nm; phenicoxanthin, 6.61 min, 475 nm; zeaxanthin, 7.09 min, 456 nm; canthaxanthin, 9.05 min, 475 nm; β-cryptoxanthin, 20.3 min, 452 nm; echinenone, 22 min, 460 nm; β-carotene 60.6 min, 456 nm. Quantification of carotenoids was achieved by injecting known amounts of carotenoid standards to generate a standard curve. In addition, further confirmation of the amount eluting and detected on-line was performed using the method devised by Sandmann (35Sandmann G. Boger P. Sandmann G. Target Assays for Modern Herbicides and Related Phytotoxic Compounds. Lewis Publishers/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 9-13Google Scholar). The detection limit of HPLC-photodiode array detection system was 0.0003 absorbance units corresponding to 0.5 pmol/h/mg of protein enzyme activity. Below this level novel peaks were detectable having the correct retention time, but definitive spectral data were difficult to derive and therefore are referred to as trace levels. high performance liquid chromatography. Protein present in E. coli extracts was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent protocol following the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme activity was expressed as pmol formed per h/mg of protein in all cases. When determining the in vivo rate of carotenoid formation carotenoid-synthesizing E. coli cultures were induced and time points taken at 1-h intervals. In vivo and in vitro comparisons were made between cells induced for the same time period in the case of recombinant strains. Substrates were supplied in the form of extracts prepared from recombinant E. coli strains accumulating β-carotene, zeaxanthin, and canthaxanthin in the all-trans configuration. This procedure overcame difficulties experienced when introducing carotenoids into aqueous incubation mixtures. All varieties of the CrtZ enzymes formed zeaxanthin from β-carotene via the monohydroxylated compound β-cryptoxanthin. The intermediate β-cryptoxanthin was detectable at significant levels (20-40%) as shown in Fig. 2A When canthaxanthin was supplied to the CrtZ enzymes astaxanthin was formed via phoenicoxanthin in all cases. Astaxanthin was the predominant product constituting (>70%) of the total products (Fig. 2B). Canthaxanthin was the predominant (63-68%) product synthesized by CrtW/BKT from β-carotene; significant amounts (30-35%) of its mono-keto intermediate echinenone were also detected. The ratio of canthaxanthin to echinenone was independent of species (Fig. 2C). When supplied with zeaxanthin, CrtW and BKT preparations only formed trace levels (0.5 pmol/h/mg of protein) of astaxanthin, but 4-ketozeaxanthin was formed predominantly by the enzyme from all varieties (Fig. 2D). Why the CrtW and BKT enzymes were unable to catalyze the conversion of 4-ketozeaxanthin to astaxanthin from the initial substrate zeaxanthin efficiently is difficult to explain. It is possible that the experimental conditions were not optimal. However, in vivo 4-ketozeaxanthin can accumulate (up to 50% of the total carotenoid content) in recombinant E. coli strains forming ketocarotenoids (15Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and in the marine bacteria it is often more predominant than astaxanthin (14Yokoyama A. Izumida H. Miki W. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1842-1844Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Such findings correlate with the in vitro data reported in this study and could suggest that the formation of the 4′ keto group on 3,3′-hydroxylated β-ionone ring-containing carotenoids is prevented if prior keto group formation at position 4 has occurred. Reaction products were separated by HPLC and identified with an on-line photodiode array detector, from which spectral data could be derived (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Comparison with authentic standards enabled conclusive identification by cochromatography and comparative spectral data. In all cases the CrtZ/W and BKT reaction products were of the all-trans configuration and constituted novel compounds not present in control samples. Controls were performed with both extracts of E. coli strains not harboring astaxanthin-forming genes and heat-denatured extracts. Some compounds present at low levels did occur in the controls and were also detectable in the experimental incubations, but they did not cochromatogram with the CrtZ/W and BKT reaction products and were spectrally unrelated. Presumably these compounds were derived from the substrates due to nonspecific oxidation. Thus it can be confirmed that the enzymes CrtZ/W of marine bacteria, CrtZ of Erwinia, and BKT of Haematococcus are bifunctional in their activity. Hydroxylation of carotenoid β-ionone rings by CrtZ can be performed specifically at the 3,3′ positions regardless of the presence of previous keto group formation at positions 4,4′. Although the formation of keto groups by CrtW/BKT is specific at positions 4,4′ on the β-ionone rings retrospective of previous 3,3′ hydroxylation, it must be stated that the mono-keto reaction product accumulates if prior 3,3′ hydroxylation has occurred. In this study, we have only used carotenoids containing β-ionone rings as they are the precursors involved in astaxanthin formation. It would be interesting to ascertain whether the substrate specificity and product diversity would extend to ε-ring cyclic carotenoids or even acyclic carotenoids. In Table I the maximum catalytic activities are presented. These data indicate that compared with the Erwinia CrtZ the marine bacteria enzymes possess greater (e.g. A. aurantiacum, 10-fold) ability to convert canthaxanthin to astaxanthin. In contrast, the Erwinia enzyme shows greater (e.g. 10-fold compared with Alcaligenes) activity for the conversion of β-carotene to zeaxanthin than canthaxanthin to astaxanthin. Of the CrtZ enzymes the marine bacterium A. aurantiacum possessed the greatest activity. Comparison of CrtW/BKT activities using β-carotene as substrate indicated that the Alcaligenes PC-1 CrtW was about 2-fold greater than the other varieties which were similar in activity (Table I). 4-Ketozeaxanthin was formed from zeaxanthin at a similar rate by all of the enzymes examined.Table IIn vitro activities of CrtZ (I) and CrtW/BKT (II) enzymesEnzyme source (recombinant E. coli strain)Gene product assayedSpecific enzyme activityβ-Carotene → zeaxanthinCanthaxanthin → astaxanthinpmol/h/mg proteinI.

Corresponding to typical in vitro rates for CrtZ enzymes of 2.5 μg/g dry weight/h (mean from typical experiment) and CrtW/BKT 0.83 μg/g dry weight/h (mean from typical experiment). The in vitro rates for CrtZ and W/BKT, respectively, are 47 and 46% of the in vivo rate. To our knowledge no previous data have been reported comparing in vivo and vitro rates of carotenoid formation. Other enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis have been compared with their in vivo biosynthetic capacity. In these instances it was found that the enzymes camphor hydroxylase, abietadiene and abietadienol hydroxylase only constituted 10-20% (25Funk C. Croteau R. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or 1% (26Funk C. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) of the in vivo capacity. Considering that carotenoids like other terpenoids are hydrophobic (preventing effective use in aqueous solution), easily degraded, oxidized, and prone to isomerization, it is not surprising that in vitro rates are typically a poor reflection of their in vivo counterparts. Taking these facts into account along with the strong analogy between qualitative product formation in vitro and in vivo, we believe it is justified that at present the in vitro system described represents a creditable representation of the in vivo situation. The absence of oxygen on carotenoid hydroxylation and oxygenation in vitro was assessed. Table II shows experimental data obtained with the A. aurantiacum enzymes using the substrates β-carotene, canthaxanthin, and zeaxanthin independently. It was evident that all catalyzed reactions studied were oxygen-dependent, each having a similar degree of sensitivity to the absence of oxygen. Phoenicoxanthin was formed at a rate of 17.0 pmol/h/mg of protein, quantitatively similar to the aerobic rate of 22.0 pmol/h/mg of protein. However, when the levels of phoenicoxanthin formed aerobically and aerobic are compared in a qualitative manner with respect to their proportion of total CrtZ products it is significant that phoenicoxanthin the monohydroxylated product is the predominant product compared with astaxanthin (dihydroxylated) under aerobic conditions. When the aerobic CrtZ activity was reduced to a total rate quantitatively similar to the anaerobic level, qualitatively astaxanthin remained the principal product. Thus, predominance of phoenicoxanthin in the anaerobic incubation was a finding specific to those conditions. Similar findings of mono-ketolated product accumulation were observed with CrtW and β-carotene as substrate. It was impossible to observe any difference in the product profile formed from zeaxanthin by CrtW/BKT as the activity was not detectable, and as stated previously 4-ketozeaxanthin is the principal product of this reaction. From the experimental data it can be concluded that oxygen is involved in all of the reactions performed by the CrtZ and W enzymes from marine bacteria; this also reflects the situation found with BKT and Erwinia CrtZ (data not shown). At present we cannot conclusively ascertain whether the oxygen moieties present in the carotenoid molecule resulting from enzymatic synthesis are derived directly from molecular oxygen or if oxygen is indirectly utilized in the catalysis. These findings are the first in vitro evidence that the enzymes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis are oxygen-dependent, and they complement previous in vivo studies described for zeaxanthin formation by Flavobacterium species (27McDermott J.B.C. Brown D.J. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), xanthophyll synthesis in leaf tissue (28Yamamoto H.Y. Chichester C.O. Nakayama T.O. Arch.

Boussiba S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1519-1524Google Scholar). The changing pattern of products formed with reduced oxygen levels suggests that its presence or absence could also play a crucial regulatory role over product formation and could possibly be influenced by environmental conditions.Table IIOxygen dependence of CrtZ- and CrtW-mediated reactionsGene product assayedSubstrateActivity% InhibitionAerobicAnaerobicpmol/h/mg proteinCrtZβ-Carotene22 ± 0.94 ± 2.076CrtZCanthaxanthin219 ± 23.024 ± 7.088CrtZ (heat-denatured)β-Carotene/canthaxanthin00CrtWβ-Carotene22 ± 5.01 ± 0.596CrtWZeaxanthin39 ± 0.20100CrtW (heat-denatured)β-Carotene/canthaxanthin00 Open table in a new tab In the absence of any exogenously added cofactors significant activity (20%) was detectable.

What features of the amino acid sequence of integral membrane proteins control their insertion and orientation in the membrane? A number of recent studies in Escherichia coli have suggested that hydrophobic segments both target bacterial inner membrane proteins to the membrane and drive their insertion into the lipid bilayer, whereas flanking positively charged amino acids determine the final orientation of the hydrophobic transmembrane segments (1von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

The glycosylation acceptor peptide N-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-N-methylamide and the nonacceptor peptide N-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-(allo)Thr-N-methylamide were synthesized according to Ref. 24Erickson B.W. Merrifield R.B. Hill R.L. Neurath H. The Proteins. Academic Press, London1976: 255-527Crossref Google Scholar. Oligonucleotides were from Kebo Lab (Stockholm, Sweden). Site-specific mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) as modified by Geisselsoder et al. (26Geisselsoder J. Witney F. Yuckenberg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-791Google Scholar). All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing of single-stranded M13 DNA using T7 DNA polymerase. For cloning into and expression from the pGEM1 plasmid, the 5′ end of the lep gene was modified first by the introduction of an XbaI site and second by changing the context 5′ to the initiator ATG codon to a “Kozak consensus” sequence (27Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, the 5′ region of the gene was modified to: ATAACCCGCGAAT (XbaI site and initiator codon underlined). Mutants with four transmembrane segments were made by fusing the H1-P1-H2 region (from the upstream XbaI site to a KpnI site introduced at the codon corresponding to Asp99 in the wild type sequence) of one Lep construct to a KpnI site introduced just upstream of the start codon of a second Lep construct (see Fig. 1). The KpnI site introduced three new amino acid residues (Glu-Val-Pro) at the fusion site. The XbaI-SmaI fragment carrying the constructs was cloned into pGEM1 behind the SP6 promoter. For cloning into the pSFV1 in vivo expression vector (28Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), constructs were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pGEM1 using polymerase chain reaction primers introducing BamHI and SmaI sites flanking the relevant gene. The BamHI-SmaI fragment carrying the constructs was then cloned into the pSFV1 polylinker region. E. coli strain MC1061 (29Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13844-13849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) transformed with the pING1 vector (30Johnston S. Lee J.H. Ray D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) carrying the leader peptidase mutant WT-3K under control of the arabinose promoter was grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.5% fructose, and all amino acids (50 μg/ml each) except methionine. An overnight culture was diluted 1:25 in fresh medium, shaken for 3.5 h at 37°C, induced with arabinose (0.2%) for 5 min, and labeled with [35S]methionine (150 μCi/ml). After 1 min, nonradioactive methionine was added (500 μg/ml) and incubation was stopped by chilling on ice. Cells were spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, resuspended in ice-cold buffer (40% w/v sucrose, 33 mM Tris pH 8.0), and incubated with lysozyme (5 μg/ml) and 1 mM EDTA for 15 min on ice. Aliquots of the cell suspension were incubated for 1 h on ice, either with 0.75 mg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin or with (0.75 mg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin - 1.0 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor - 0.64 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After the addition of trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, samples were acid-precipitated (trichloroacetic acid, 10% final concentration), resuspended in 10 mM Tris/2% SDS, immunoprecipitated with antisera to Lep and OmpA (an outer membrane control (31von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar)), washed, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pGEM1 plasmids carrying the relevant constructs were linearized at a SmaI site immediately downstream of the coding region prior to in vitro transcription. Synthesis of RNA by SP6 RNA polymerase and translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes was performed as described (32Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or according to the protocol provided by Promega. Translocation of polypeptides to the lumenal side of the microsomes was assayed by prevention of N-linked glycosylation through competitive inhibition by the addition of a glycosylation acceptor tripeptide but not by a nonacceptor tripeptide and by proteinase K treatment of the microsomes (12Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline extraction of microsomes was carried out as described (33Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were scanned in a FUJIX Bas 1000 PhosphorImaging Plate Scanner and analyzed using the MacBAS software (version 2.1). The pSFV1 vector containing the relevant constructs were linearized at a unique SphI site downstream of the cloned gene. The linearized plasmid was used as template for in vitro transcription, and mRNA was transfected into cells by electroporation as described earlier (34Liljeström P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 7 h post-transfection, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met for 15 min, chased for 30 min, and solubilized in Nonidet P-40 (1%) lysate buffer (35Wahlberg J.M. Boere W.A. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4991-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used for protein A-mediated immunoprecipitation using a Lep polyclonal antiserum. The precipitate was solubilized in Endo H buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM sodium-citrate, pH 6.0) and incubated for 5 min at 70°C. The sample was then divided in two and either mock treated or Endo H-treated (5 milliunits) for 6 h at 37°C and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. In order to be able to make direct comparisons between the topological effects of positively charged amino acids in membrane proteins expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, we chose the well characterized E. coli inner membrane protein leader peptidase (Lep) as a model protein. Lep has been used extensively in studies of membrane protein assembly in E. coli (1von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and has also been shown to insert efficiently into ER-derived dog pancreas microsomes (11Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lep constructs with one and two transmembrane segments and various point mutations, additions, or deletions (Fig. 1) were made from the wild type gene by site-directed mutagenesis. Molecules with four transmembrane segments were constructed by fusing the H1-L1-H2 region from one construct with the entire coding region from another (36Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To map the cytoplasmic or extra-cytoplasmic location of the N-terminal tail (Ncyt and Next) and the C-terminal P2 domain (Ccyt and Cext), acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation that can only be modified if translocated to the lumen of the ER were introduced into these regions by site-directed mutagenesis (note that all constructs with an N-terminal glycosylation acceptor site have an extra N-terminal extension of 14 residues, except in wild type-derived (WT*) construct and construct ΔH2 (Fig. 2), where the extension is 16 residues). All genes were cloned behind the SP6 promoter in the pGEM1 vector for expression in vitro and into the Semliki Forest virus vector pSFV1 (28Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) for expression in vivo In E. coli, Lep adopts a somewhat unusual membrane topology with both the N and C termini facing the periplasm. When expressed in vitro in the presence of microsomes, both termini are again translocated, whereas the P1 loop remains on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (12Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To check whether both the H1 and H2 transmembrane segments are necessary for targeting and insertion into the ER membrane, transmembrane segment H2 was deleted from WT* with an N-terminal extension including a glycosylation acceptor site and a mutation (Asn214→ Gln) that removes the only acceptor site in the P2 domain, and the protein was expressed in the absence and the presence of microsomes. As seen in Fig. 2, the ΔH2 mutant was glycosylated on the N-terminal acceptor site to the same extent as WT* (lanes 2 and 5). When the microsomes were treated with proteinase K, a protease-resistant fragment representing the H2-P2 domain (12Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was produced from WT* (Fig. 2, lane 3), whereas mutant ΔH2 was completely degraded (Fig. 2, lane 6). After disruption of the microsomes with the detergent Triton X-100, no protease-resistant material remained for either construct (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that H1 has an intrinsic ability to target to the ER membrane and to insert in the same Next-Ccyt orientation as adopted in E. coli Lep has a highly charged cytoplasmic loop (P1) that cannot be translocated across the inner E. coli membrane, presumably because the positively charged amino acids immediately downstream of the first hydrophobic domain (H1) prevent translocation (37von Heijne G. Wickner W. Dalbey R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3363-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Andersson H. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9751-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, even though the addition of one or more lysines to the N-tail preceding H1 can cause certain Lep constructs lacking most of the charged residues in the P1 loop to insert into the inner membrane in an inverted Ncyt-Ccyt orientation with P1 exposed to the periplasm (31von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 39Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. Cell. 1990; 62: 1135-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), no translocation of the P1 loop was observed even when as many as three lysines were added to the N-tail in wild type Lep (mutant WT-3K). This mutant was expressed in E. coli, and its topology was probed by trypsin treatment of spheroplasts followed by immunoprecipitation with a Lep polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 3A). Very little protein remained after protease treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 2), and there was no protease-protected fragment diagnostic for translocation of the P1 domain (31von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Parallel analysis of the protease-sensitivity of the mature and precursor forms of the outer membrane protein OmpA was performed to ensure that the spheroplasts were intact. The protease sensitivity of the periplasmically exposed mature OmpA demonstrates that no intact cells remained, whereas the protease-resistance of cytoplasmic, nontranslocated precursor OmpA demonstrates that the spheroplasts were intact (31von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, the P2 domain in WT-3K is exposed to the periplasmic space, whereas the P1 domain is cytoplasmic. It has been shown that translocation of the P2 domain across the microsomal membrane is much less sensitive to the presence of positively charged amino acids immediately downstream of H2 than when expression is carried out in E. coli (11Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that the addition of one or more lysines to the normally uncharged N-tail of Lep might result in an inverted orientation in microsomes with the highly charged P1 loop in the lumen, in contrast to what is seen in E. coli Wild type Lep expressed in vitro in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes was efficiently glycosylated on its only potential acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation (Asn214) (Fig. 3B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2), demonstrating the lumenal disposition of the P2 domain. The addition of a single N-terminal lysine between Met4 and Phe5 resulted in a marked reduction in glycosylation efficiency (Fig. 3B, top panel, lanes 3 and 4), and with two and four N-terminal lysines the glycosylation efficiency was only ∼20%, consistent with a predominantly Ncyt-Ccyt topology. The decrease in glycosylation was paralleled by a concomitant decrease in the amount of protease-resistant H2-P2 fragment (data not shown). In all cases, both the glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms were properly integrated into the microsomal membrane as shown by their retention in the pellet after alkaline extraction (Ref. 33Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar and data shown for the 0K and 2K mutants in Fig. 3B, bottom panel). We conclude that positively charged residues in the N-terminal tail have a strong influence on the topology of Lep expressed both in the E. coli and microsomal systems, whereas positively charged residues in the P1 loop between the two transmembrane segments block translocation only in E. coli Another variable that has been shown to influence the topology of Lep-derived constructs in E. coli is the length of the P1 loop; although this 39-residue-long loop cannot be translocated (Fig. 3A), translocation is possible when its length is increased to more than ∼60 residues (40Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that this may be related to the participation of the Sec translocase in the translocation of long loops across the inner membrane; only a small number of positively charged residues would be allowed in short loops (≤60 residues) that cannot use the Sec translocase for translocation, whereas longer loops that use the more permissive Sec pathway would have less stringent sequence requirements (41von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test if the length of the P1 loop affects topology also in the ER membrane, a series of constructs with zero, one, two, and four N-terminal lysines and P1 lengths ranging from 19 to 88 residues was analyzed in the microsomal in vitro system. As shown in Fig. 4, the length of the P1 loop has at best a minor and not very consistent effect on the topology in the 1K series of mutants and has no effect for the 0K, 2K, and 4K series, in contrast to the situation in E. coli The construct with 88 residues in the P1 loop was glycosylated somewhat more efficiently than the other constructs when two and four lysines were present in the N-tail (Fig. 4B); however, in this particular case there is an additional glycosylation site in the P1 loop, ∼15 residues downstream of H1. The higher glycosylation efficiency may thus result from partial glycosylation of this site rather than from translocation of the P2 domain. To ascertain that this was indeed the case, a second glycosylation site was inserted into the middle of the P1 loop, and the site in P2 was simultaneously removed. The resulting construct 2K(88*) with two N-terminal lysines and with two glycosylation sites in P1 and none in P2 was efficiently glycosylated (Fig. 4A, lanes 11 and 12); 20% of the chains were glycosylated on both sites, and 70% were glycosylated only on one, demonstrating that no more than ∼10% of the molecules have the wild type orientation (or fail altogether to integrate into the membrane). N-terminal positively charged residues thus efficiently promote an inverted, Ncyt-Ccyt topology in the ER membrane irrespective of the length of the P1 loop. Previous topological analyses in E. coli of Lep-derived constructs with four transmembrane segments and different distributions of positively charged residues in the N-tail and the loops connecting the transmembrane segments have demonstrated that “frustrated” constructs, i.e. molecules where the distribution of positively charged residues is such that neither the Next-Cext nor the Ncyt-Ccyt topology will have all the highly charged loops in the cytoplasm, often adopt a “leave one out” topology with only three of the hydrophobic segments inserted across the membrane (36Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To test if the influence of positively charged residues is equally strong in the ER, a subset of the constructs previously characterized in E. coli was expressed in the microsome system. First, two nonfrustrated constructs that adopt, respectively, the Next-Cext (i.e. N and C terminus in the periplasm) and the Ncyt-Ccyt topology in E. coli were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5A, construct 0K/3K/0K/3K with three lysines in each of the loops between the first and second and between the third and fourth transmembrane segments was efficiently glycosylated both in the C-terminal P2 domain (Fig. 5A, middle panel, lane 2) and on an Asn-Ser-Thr acceptor site introduced into the N-tail (Fig. 5A, top panel, lane 2) and thus adopts the Next-Cext topology just as in E. coli The nonglycosylated full-length product of construct *0K/3K/0K/3K (Fig. 5A, top panel, lane 7) has the same size as the corresponding 0K/3K/0K/3K construct expressed in E. coli (36Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A, top panel, lane 8). Proteinase K treatment of the microsomes (Fig. 5A, top panel, lane 5) produced a protected fragment that runs at the approximate location of the weak band in lane 1 of the top panel of Fig. 5A marked by a black square in the middle and bottom panels and considerably below this band in the top panel This suggests that the protected fragment is glycosylated when the P2 domain carries a glycosylation site (Fig. 5A, middle and bottom panels) but not when the glycosylation site is in the N-tail (fig. 5A, top panel). Indeed, the protected fragment in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 5A has the same size as a glycosylated, protease-protected fragment derived from microsome-integrated wild type Lep that was previously shown to correspond to the glycosylated H2-P2 domain (Ref. 12Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), and we conclude that the protected fragment in Fig. 5A results from cleavage in the L1′ loop. With glycosylation sites simultaneously present in both the N-tail and the P2 domain, a majority of the molecules were glycosylated on both sites (Fig. 5A, bottom panel, lane 2), suggesting that all membrane-inserted molecules are glycosylated in the P2 domain and that most of these are also glycosylated on the N-tail. To rule out that the rather small number of residues between the N-terminal glycosylation site and H1 cause the somewhat inefficient glycosylation of the N-tail (12Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also made constructs where this distance was increased to 19 and 25 residues. Both were glycosylated with the same efficiency as the original construct (data not shown), suggesting that the N-terminal glycosylation site is either intrinsically less easily modified than the site in the P2 domain or that the N-tail is somewhat less efficiently translocated than P2. In any case, these data show that the majority of the molecules have the expected Next-Cext orientation with the L1′ loop (and most likely also the L1 loop) exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the microsomal membrane. In contrast, construct 3K/0K/3K/0K with three lysines in the N-tail and in the loop between transmembrane segments 2 and 3 was found to be essentially unglycosylated on both the N- and C-terminal acceptor sites (Fig. 5B, top panel), suggesting the same Ncyt-Ccyt topology as observed in E. coli The trivial explanation that this particular construct is not inserted into the membrane was ruled out by alkaline extraction of the microsomes (33Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); as seen in Fig. 5B (bottom panel), a large fraction of the molecules partitioned with the wash supernatant when translation was carried out in the absence of microsomes (or when microsomes were added post-translationally; data not shown), whereas essentially no molecules were found in this fraction when translation was carried out in the presence of microsomes, demonstrating proper membrane integration. Further, the long L1 loop in the related construct 3K/88/3K/0K (see below) is efficiently glycosylated, again consistent with proper membrane assembly and an Ncyt-Ccyt topology. Both nonfrustrated constructs with a glycosylation acceptor site in the P2 domain were also expressed in vivo in BHK cells. As in vitro, construct 3K/0K/3K/0K was not glycosylated, whereas construct 0K/3K/0K/3K was fully glycosylated (Fig. 5C), demonstrating efficient targeting and insertion into the ER membrane (we cannot completely rule out that some molecules may fail to integrate and are rapidly degraded). The two lower molecular weight bands marked with black and white squares are also faintly seen in most of the in vitro experiments. These bands run at roughly the same position as nonglycosylated and glycosylated wild type Lep, respectively (data not shown), and may result either from endogenous proteolysis or from internal initiation at one or other of the four methionine codons present in the L2 loop (see Fig. 1). We conclude that nonfrustrated constructs with four transmembrane segments based on a bacterial inner membrane protein can be targeted and inserted into the ER membrane both in vitro and in vivo and that they adopt the same topology as in E. coli Two frustrated constructs, previously shown to adopt leave one out topologies in E. coli, were also tested in the ER system. Construct 0K/3K/3K/0K was glycosylated on the N terminus and in the P2 domain both in vitro and in vivo and was doubly glycosylated when acceptor sites were simultaneously present in these two regions (Fig. 6A, bottom), suggesting that the topology is predominantly Next-Cext with four transmembrane segments (Fig. 6B, bottom panels). This is in contrast to E. coli, where this construct adopts a leave one out topology with only three transmembrane segments (36Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N-tail in construct 3K/0K/0K/3K was not glycosylated, whereas the P2 domain was efficiently glycosylated (Fig. 6A, left top panels). When expressed in vivo, this construct was again fully glycosylated in the P2 domain (Fig. 6A, right top panel). As in E. coli, the dominating topology is thus Ncyt-Cext, with only three transmembrane segments (Fig. 6B). It is formally possible that the second hydrophobic segment is translocated into the lumen with the first, third, and fourth segments spanning the membrane; however, given that there is no precedence for the translocation of hydrophobic segments across the ER membrane, we consider this unlikely. Because this construct is slightly less efficiently glycosylated in the P2 domain in vitro than the nonfrustrated construct 0K/3K/0K/3K (65% versus 75%) and because most of the nonglycosylated molecules are found in the membrane fraction after alkaline extraction in both cases (data not shown), a minor proportion of the molecules (∼10%) may have the P2 domain in the cytoplasm. This is not the case in vivo, however. Which of the two uncharged loops that is exposed to the lumenal side cannot be determined with the glycosylation assay. Protease treatment of the microsomes did not give interpretable results for this mutant, because no unique protease-resistant fragment was produced. In order to address this point further, two constructs where the L1 loop between the first and second transmembrane segments is 88 rather than 25 residues long were also tested. A glycosylation acceptor site placed in this loop is far enough from transmembrane segment H1 (∼15 residues) to be accessible to the lumenally disposed glycosyltransferase, and the location of the loop can thus be mapped. In the nonfrustrated construct 3K/88/3K/0K, the long loop was quite efficiently glycosylated (Fig. 7A, lane 3), and no doubly glycosylated molecules were apparent when the acceptor site in the P2 domain was also present (Fig. 7A, lane 2), demonstrating that the dominating topology is Ncyt-Ccyt, as expected. The slight increase in glycosylation efficiency (from 45 to 55%; compare lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 7A) when the acceptor site in the P2 domain was added suggests that a small fraction of the molecules may have the long loop in the cytoplasm and the P2 domain in the lumen. In the frustrated construct 3K/88/0K/3K, both the long loop and the P2 domain could be glycosylated. With one acceptor site in the long loop and one in the P2 domain, molecules with both one and two glycosyl moieties were apparent (Fig. 7A, lane 4); with an additional acceptor site present in the P2 domain, the molecules were glycosylated either once or on all three sites (Fig. 7A, lane 5). The absence of twice glycosylated molecules modified only in the P2 domain in the latter construct demonstrates that no molecules have a topology with the P2 domain and the short L2 loop between the second and third transmembrane segments in the lumen. Thus, the majority of the molecules have both the long loop and the P2 domain in the lumen (Ncyt-Cext, leave one out topology) (Fig. 7B), although the singly glycosylated molecules in lane 5 of Fig. 7A suggest the additional presence of molecules with four transmembrane segments and Ncyt-Ccyt orientation. Similar proportions of nonglycosylated and glycosylated molecules were found in the membrane pellet after alkaline extraction (data not shown). We have constructed a number of model proteins with either one, two, or four hydrophobic transmembrane segments and have analyzed their membrane assembly both in vitro in dog pancreas microsomes and in vivo in BHK cells. Most of these constructs have previously been analyzed in E. coli (36Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 39Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. Cell. 1990; 62: 1135-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 40Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and we can thus make a detailed comparison between the sequence determinants of membrane protein topology in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In general, we find that positively charged residues placed in the N-tail have similar effects on the topology of model proteins in both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, i.e. that such residues prevent translocation of the N-tail across the membrane. However, there are also some obvious differences. In constructs with two transmembrane segments, the length of the connecting loop does not seem to be important for its ability to be translocated across the ER membrane (Fig. 4), whereas in E. coli short and long loops apparently use different mechanisms for translocation and react differently to the presence of positively charged residues (40Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 42Andersson H. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 43Sääf A. Andersson H. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, when two lysines are added to the N terminus of wild type Lep, most of the molecules insert into the ER membrane in an inverted Ncyt-Ccyt orientation (Fig. 3), whereas addition of three lysines to the N-tail has no effect on the orientation when the protein is expressed in E. coli Our data thus suggest that positively charged residues placed in the N-tail are critical topological determinants in both E. coli and mammalian ER, whereas charged residues in the following P1 loop have a major effect on the topology only in E. coli Three of the four constructs with four transmembrane segments also behave similarly in the two systems. The nonfrustrated constructs 3K/0K/3K/0K and 0K/3K/0K/3K insert according to the positive inside rule both in E. coli (36Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and in the ER. However, of the two frustrated constructs, one (3K/0K/0K/3K) adopts a leave one out Ncyt-Cext topology in both E. coli and the ER, whereas the other (0K/3K/3K/0K) behaves differently in the two systems. Whereas in E. coli this construct has only three transmembrane segments and Next-Ccyt topology, both the N- and C termini are quite efficiently translocated across the ER membrane. This suggests that the L2 loop between the second and third hydrophobic segments is lumenal in these molecules, despite its high charge. In summary, in all constructs with a highly charged N-tail the first transmembrane segment is oriented Ncyt, and in constructs with no positively charged residue in the N-tail the orientation is Next. This is consistent with earlier statistical (2von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 3Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J.

There is also a clear tendency for highly charged internal loops to remain on the cytoplasmic side, although this tendency is stronger in E. coli than in the ER system. The apparently greater ease with which highly charged loops are translocated in the eukaryotic system may be related to the absence of a membrane potential in the ER (cf Ref. 45Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and may explain the earlier observation that extra-cytoplasmic loops in eukaryotic plasma membrane proteins have on average a higher content of positively charged residues than found in bacterial inner membrane proteins (2von Heijne G.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), is inconsistent with the leave one out topologies found in E. coli and with the Ncyt-Cext topology found for constructs 3K/0K/0K/3K an 3K/88/0K/3K in the ER, as well as with the results of a recent study on the topology of P-glycoprotein mutants in the ER (48Zhang J.-T. Lee C.H. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1742-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Possibly, proteins with widely spaced hydrophobic segments insert in a sequential fashion (49Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 50Lipp J. Flint N. Haeuptle M.-T. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas regions with closely spaced hydrophobic segments insert according to a helical hairpin mechanism. Finally, we note that the observation that the topological information present in certain of our constructs is interpreted differently in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells suggests that problems encountered when trying to overexpress eukaryotic membrane proteins in prokaryotic hosts may in some cases be related to incorrect topologies. If so, redesigning the protein to conform better to the stricter prokaryotic version of the positive inside rule may be one way to obtain higher expression levels (51Kiefer H. Krieger J.

We investigated the relationship between domain-domain orientation and synergistic adhesive activity of the FIII9 and FIII10 pair of domains. The interdomain interaction of the FIII9-10 pair was perturbed by introduction of short flexible linkers between the FIII9 and FIII10 domains. Incremental extensions of the interdomain link between FIII9 and FIII10 reduced the initial cell attachment, but had a much more pronounced effect on the downstream cell adhesion events of spreading and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. The extent of disruption of cell adhesion depended upon the length of the interdomain linker. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the wild type and mutant FIII9-10 proteins demonstrated that the structure of the RGD-containing loop is unaffected by domain-domain interactions. We conclude that integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the central cell binding domain of fibronectin depends not only upon specific interaction sites, but also on the relative orientation of these sites.

Fibronectins (FNs) are adhesive proteins that are abundant in the ECM of many cell types and have a critical role in many biological processes (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Twenty isoforms of human FN, the expression of which is developmentally regulated, can be generated as a result of alternative splicing of the primary FN transcript (2Kornblihtt A.R. Vibe-Pedersen K.

Each monomer is composed of type I, type II, and type III domains (FI, FII, and FIII), identified as repeating amino acid motifs in the primary structure (5Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C.

These motifs occur in many diverse cellular and extracellular proteins (6Campbell I.D. Spitzfaden C. Structure. 1994; 2: 333-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Separable, functional regions of the FN molecule have been identified that contain binding activities for other components of the ECM, including collagen, fibrin, and heparin (1Hynes R.O.

Cells bind to FN via the central cell binding domain (CCBD) spanning the eighth, ninth, and tenth FIII domains (FIII8-10) (7Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M.

Given the ubiquity of expression of FNs and their extensive role in cell adhesion, the molecular mechanisms by which FN supports cell binding and induces the integrin signaling pathway are of great interest. An earlier nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of FIII10 demonstrated that the RGD sequence resides in a mobile loop between the F and G β strands of the domain (27Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides that contain the RGD sequence exhibit some cell adhesive activity but do not mimic the full adhesive function of the FN molecule (7Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M.

Additional sites have been identified recently that are required for maximal adhesive activity.

We have shown previously that the structural integrity of the FIII9-10 pair of domains is required for the synergistic activity of the two domains in supporting cell spreading (36Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the relationship between domain-domain interactions and the biological activity of the FIII9-10 pair in specific cell adhesion events. Our strategy was to modify the strength of the domain-domain interaction and the relative mobility of the two domains by introducing flexible polyglycine interdomain linkers of different lengths. The influence of the linkers on the structure of the FIII9-10 pair was analyzed by NMR and the affect on biological activity of FIII9-10 was assessed by the ability of immobilized wild type and mutant GST-FIII fusion proteins to support events involved in cell adhesion. We discuss the correlation between our biological data and the underlying structural changes as examined by NMR and thermodynamic methods. NMR measurements were performed on fully 15N-labeled samples of FIII10 and FIII9-10 at 25°C in 20 mM sodium acetate, 5% D2O, pH 4.8. Protein concentrations were 4 mM (FIII10) or 1.5 mM (FIII9-10). Three-dimensional 15N-correlated 1H,1H NOESY spectra (37Fesik S.W. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 78: 588-593Google Scholar) were recorded on a home-built spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600 MHz. The constructs pGEXFIII10 and pGEXFIII9-10 have been described previously (36Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The FIII9-10 linker mutant FIII9-PG-10, containing one additional proline and one glycine residue between threonine 1415 at the COOH terminus of FIII9, and valine 1416 at the NH2 terminus of FIII10 (according to the domain boundaries in Kornblihtt et al. (38Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar)) was expressed from the construct pGEXFIII9-PG-10. For construction of pGEXFIII9-PG-10, FIII9, and FIII10 were amplified separately from FN cDNA (pFHIII (2Kornblihtt A.R. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)) by Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the polymerase chain reaction. Oligonucleotide primers were designed that introduced a BglII site into the 5′ end of the amplified FIII9 cDNA, an XhoI site into the 3′ end of FIII10, and a SmaI site, CCCGGG, encoding the extra proline and glycine residues, into the FIII9-10 linker. The primers used were: FIII9 5′, TGAAGATCTGGTCTTGATTCCCCAACT, FIII9 3′, GGGTGTTGATTGTTGGCCAATCAATA; FIII10 5′, GGGGTTTCTGATGTTCCGAG GGA, FIII10 3′, TCACTCGAGTCATGTTCGGTAATTAATGGA. The polymerase chain reaction products were cleaved with either BglI (FIII9) or XhoI (FIII10), gel-purified using QIAEX II (Qiagen Ltd., Dorking, United Kingdom (UK)) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The sequence of the inserts in the recombinant clones was confirmed using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham International plc, Amersham, UK). The mutant pGEXFIII9-P[G]5-10, encoding the fusion protein GFIII9-P[G]5-10, was generated by the introduction of the sequence GGAGGCGGAGGC encoding three glycine residues. Annealed oligonucleotides were inserted into the SmaI site of pGEXFIII9-PG-10. The sequence of the recombinant clones was confirmed as above. The position of insertion of the extended linkers in the mutant FIII9-10 proteins is shown in Fig. 2. GST fusion proteins (GFIII9, GFIII10, GFIII9-10, GFIII9-PG-10, GFIII9-P[G]5-10) were expressed as described previously (36Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cultures of Escherichia coli transformed with pGEXFIII constructs were grown overnight in 8 × TY (6.4% tryptone T, 4.0% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl), diluted 1 in 10 into fresh 8 × TY, and incubated with shaking for 1 h at 37°C. Induction of protein expression was achieved by addition of 0.1 M isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and further incubation for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.02 volumes ice-cold PBS, and lysed by freeze-thawing and sonication. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter and nutated with 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 10 min at 20°C. The fusion proteins were eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose beads with 10 mM glutathione, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, and dialyzed against PBS at 4°C. Cleaved FN fragments FIII9, FIII10, FIII9-10, FIII9-PG-10, and FIII9-P[G]5-10 were produced by the addition of thrombin (2.5 units of thrombin/mg of protein) to GST-FIII fusion proteins adsorbed to the glutathione-Sepharose matrix. Purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectroscopy. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells and human endometrial stromal fibroblasts (hESF) were used in cell attachment and spreading assays. Pure cultures of hESF were prepared by collagenase digestion of endometrial tissue followed by centrifugation through Percoll as described elsewhere (39Fernandez-Shaw S. Shorter S.C. Naish C.E. Barlow D.H. Starkey P.M. Hum. Reprod. 1992; 7: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion and spreading assays were carried out as described previously (36Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Essentially, the surface of duplicate wells of 96-well flat-bottomed, tissue culture-grade plates (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) was coated with doubling dilutions of 100 μg ml−1 GST-FIII fusion proteins in PBS for 16 h at 4°C and washed with PBS. Uncoated plastic was blocked by incubation in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Either BHK or hESF cells (104 in 100 μl in GMEM or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively) were inoculated into each well and incubated in 5% CO2 for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were washed gently in PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 4% glutaraldehyde in PBS, and scored for spreading as described previously (36Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Total cell attachment was assessed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet as described elsewhere (40Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Bound dye was measured at A570 nm with a Titertek Multiscan plate reader. For the inhibition assays, the surface of duplicate wells of a 96-well plate was coated with 5 μg ml−1 FN and washed and blocked as described above. Test protein diluted in 25 μl of PBS was incubated with 104 BHK cells in 25 μl of GMEM for 2 min. Cells and protein were then inoculated into the precoated wells equilibrated with 50 μl of GMEM. Cells were incubated, fixed, and analyzed as described above. The surface of duplicate wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 10 μg ml−1 FN and blocked with bovine serum albumin as described above. GMEM (30 μl) was added to each well and the plate incubated for 40 min at 37°C. BHK cells (104 cells in 50 μl of GMEM) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-α5 (clone SAM-1), α2 (clone AK7; both from Serotec, Kidlington, UK), α3 (clone P1B5) or αv (clone VNR147); both from Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) antibodies in 20 μl of PBS for 2 min at 20°C. Cells in antibody solution and GMEM were then added to the wells and the attachment assays performed as descibed above. The results were expressed as the mean of three independent experiment plus or minus the standard error of the mean (S.E.). BHK cells were allowed to spread for 1 h on tissue culture plastic-coated with 100 μg ml−1 GST-FIII fusion proteins as descibed above. The cells were washed three times with PBS, lysed with 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml−1 leupeptin for 20 min at 0°C, and passed several times through a 25-gauge needle. Cleared lysates containing equal amounts of total cell protein were incubated with anti-FAK antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml−1 leupeptin) for 1 h at 4°C. Agarose-conjugated secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Precipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min. Duplicate samples of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and Western blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (42Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20; Transduction Laboratories) or anti-FAK antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma, Poole, UK). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using the ECL kit (Amersham International plc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bands were quantified by scanning densitometry and Intelligent Quantifier software (BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI), and the level of FAK phosphorylation was expressed as relative to total FAK. Detailed NMR and thermodynamic studies of the five cleaved constructs (FIII9, FIII10, FIII9-10, FIII9-PG-10, and FIII9-P[G]5-10) are presented in a separate publication (45Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, introduction of additional linker residues leads to a gradual increase in the mobility of the domains relative to each other, as indicated by increasing T2 relaxation times of the backbone amide 15N-nuclei and to decreasing thermodynamic stabilization energies. Our results indicate that domain-domain interactions are significantly perturbed, but not completely abolished, by introduction of additional linker residues. However, perturbation of the domain-domain interactions does not affect the structure of the RGD site in solution. Fig. 3 shows that the RGDS peptide segment in FIII10 and FIII9-10 has near identical chemical shifts of backbone and side chain resonances and a completely conserved pattern of proton-proton NOEs. These data indicate that the presence of FIII9 does not introduce any additional structural or motional constraints into the highly flexible RGDS peptide. The receptors that mediate the attachment of BHK cells to the FIII9-10 region of FN were defined by the use of function blocking monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 4). Attachment of BHK cells to FN was inhibited in the presence of anti-α5 and αv antibodies by 80 and 25%, respectively, indicating that binding of these cells to FN is primarily a function of integrin α5β1, with some αvβ3 activity. The FIII domain fusion proteins GFIII10, GFIII9-10, the two modified fusion proteins GFIII9-PG-10 and GFIII9-P[G]5-10, and FN were assayed for their ability to support BHK cell attachment, as assessed by measurement of crystal violet incorporation into adherent cells on plastic coated with the immobilized proteins (Fig. 5A). The fusion proteins exhibited similar binding capacities to plastic as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). At high coating concentration (100 μg ml−1) FN and GFIII9-10 exhibited similar levels of cell attachment activity. Attachment activities of GFIII10, GFIII9-PG-10, and GFIII9-P[G]5-10 were 50, 65 and 60%, respectively, that of GFIII9-10. Thus attachment activity of both the mutant FIII9-10 proteins was reduced to a level similar to that of GFIII10. At lower coating concentrations (e.g. 6 μg ml−1, Fig. 5A) the differences in attachment activity of all GST-FIII fusion proteins were more pronounced. GFIII9-10 exhibited 65% activity relative to FN, GFIII9-PG-10, 38%, GFIII9-P[G]5-10, 28%, and GFIII10, 10% that of FN. The requirement for structural integrity of FIII9-10 for cell attachment via integrins in addition to α5β1 was also investigated in cell attachment assays using hESF cells, attachment of which is mediated by multiple integrins including α5β1. 2H. J. Mardon, unpublished data. The data for these experiments are shown in Fig. 5B At high coating concentrations (100 μg ml−1) the level of attachment to wild type GFIII9-10 was similar to that on FN. In addition, hESF cells attached efficiently to both GFIII9-PG-10, GFIII9-P[G]5-10, and GFIII10 coated at 100 μg ml−1, at a similar level to FN and GFIII9-10. At lower coating concentrations (e.g. 6 μg ml−1, Fig. 5B), while GFIII9-10 supported maximal attachment of stromal cells there was a stepwise decrease with the mutant FIII9-10 proteins with increase in the length of the interdomain linker. Immobilized GFIII10 supported approximately 10% the attachment on FN or GFIII9-10 at this concentration. The morphology of BHK cells plated onto FN, GFIII9-10, GFIII9-PG-10, GFIII9-P[G]5-10, GFIII10, or GST is shown in Fig. 6. Cells plated onto FN (Fig. 6A) exhibited a spread morphology. Cells plated onto GFIII9-10 were also spread, but not to the same extent as on FN (Fig. 6, compare B with A). The cells spread less on GFIII9-PG-10 (Fig. 6C), and very few cells exhibited a spread morphology on GFIII9-P[G]5-10 (Fig. 6D) or GFIII10 (Fig. 6E). Very few cells attached to GST (Fig. 6F) and those that did attach remained rounded. Cells attached to plates coated with the GST-FIII fusion proteins and FN were scored for spreading, expressed as the percentage of attached cells that exhibited a spread morphology. Both BHK (Fig. 7A) and hESF (Fig. 7B) cells plated onto GFIII9-10 at a coating concentration of 100 μg ml−1 exhibited similar spreading to cells on FN. However, 50% spreading activity was obtained at a much lower coating concentration of FN (∼0.2 μg ml−1) compared with 50% spreading activity on GFIII9-10 (12.5 μg ml−1). Both BHK and hESF cells spread poorly on GFIII10, which for both cell types supported less than 10% the spreading activity of GFIII9-10 at a coating concentration of 100 μg ml−1. Spreading of BHK cells on GFIII9-PG-10 coated at 100 μg ml−1 (Fig. 7C) was reduced to 70% compared with GFIII9-10, similar to the relative levels of cell attachment observed for these proteins. Spreading on the mutant GFIII-P[G]5-10, containing the longer linker, was substantially reduced at 100 μg ml−1, exhibiting levels of spreading activity less than 25% that of GFIII9-10. These differences were more pronounced at lower coating concentrations. At a coating concentration of 6.25 μg ml−1 (Fig. 7C) spreading activity of BHK cells on GFIII9-10 was approximately 30% that of FN, spreading on GFIII9-PG-10 was ∼25% that of GFIII9-10, and there was no spreading on GFIII9-P[G]5-10. The number of hESF cells that spread on GFIII9-10 coated at 100 μg ml−1 was similar to BHK cells (Fig. 7, compare D with C). The number of hESF cells spread on GFIII9-PG-10 or GFIII9-P[G]5-10 was approximately 90 and 30%, respectively, of the number of cells spread on GFIII9-10. At a coating concentration of 6.25 μg ml−1, spreading of hESF cells on GFIII9-10 was 10% that of cells on FN. Cells plated onto GFIII9-PG-10 and GFIII9-P[G]5-10 exhibited 35 and 10%, respectively, levels of spreading on GFIII9-10. Thus spreading activity of hESF cells on FIII9-PG-10 was elevated compared with BHK cells. Spreading of hESF cells on GFIII10 at 100 μg ml−1 and at 6.25 μg ml−1 was 19 and 5%, respectively, relative to spreading on GFIII9-10, similar to levels found for BHK cells. The capacity of purified wild type and mutant FIII domains to inhibit adhesion of BHK cells to fibronectin was also assessed in inhibition assays. The FIII domains were purified from GST adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads by cleavage with thrombin and were tested for their capacity to inhibit attachment of BHK cells to immobilized FN coated on plastic at 5 μg ml−1. These data are shown in Fig. 8. Attachment of BHK cells to FN was completely abolished by the presence of 125 μM FIII9-10 in the culture. At a concentration of 125 μM, FIII9-PG-10 inhibited attachment of BHK cells to FN by 20%, and no significant inhibition was observed with FIII9-P[G]5-10 within the molar range used in these experiments. Relative to the controls, in which no protein was added to the cells prior to plating out, 50% inhibition of spreading of BHK cells on FN was achieved in the presence of 12.5 μM FIII9-10 and 125 μM FIII9-PG-10. No inhibition of cell spreading was observed with FIII9-P[G]5-10. At a concentration of 125 μM, FIII10 and GRGDS peptide both inhibited attachment of BHK cells to FN by 20 and 30%, respectively, and had a small affect on cell spreading. Thus insertion of two amino acids in the interdomain linker of FIII9-10 both immobilized and in solution had different affects on cell attachment and cell spreading. Given that perturbation of the FIII9-10 had a profound effect on cell spreading, and given that integrin-mediated cell spreading appears to be preceded by FAK phosphorylation (11Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between cell spreading and FAK phosphorylation in response to adhesion to the wild type and mutant FIII9-10 proteins. The relative amounts of phosphorylated FAK in BHK cells plated onto immobilized wild type or mutant GFIII9-10 domains were determined by immunoprecipitation of FAK and subsequent Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as shown in Fig. 9A The intensity of bands identified with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and representing phosphorylated FAK was expressed relative to total FAK as shown in Fig. 9B Introduction of the short interdomain linker in GFIII9-PG-10 reduced levels of FAK phosphorylation by one-third. The longer linker in GFIII9-P[G]5-10 led to a further reduction in FAK phosphorylation, giving levels approximately 30% of that obtained with cells plated onto GFIII9-10 and similar to that of cells plated on GFIII10. For comparison of cell attachment, cell spreading and FAK phosphorylation in response to GFIII10 and the mutant FIII9-10 proteins, the levels of activity obtained in each assay were expressed relative to those obtained for FIII9-10 (Table I). Phosphorylation of FAK and cell spreading activities were tightly correlated and affected to the same degree by insertion of additional linker sequence, whereas levels of cell attachment were consistently higher.Table IComparison of FAK phosphorylation, cell spreading, and cell attachment on wild type and mutant FIII9-10 proteinsProteinFAK phosphorylationCell spreadingCell attachmentGFIII9-101.001.001.00GFIII9-PG-100.670.650.73GFIII9-P[G]5-100.290.290.65GFIII100.140.100.55"

Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). A wide variety of proteins including enzymes, membrane receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors have been shown to be PKA substrates with activities reversibly modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. It is clear that despite its broad substrate specificity, PKA activity is highly selective in a physiological setting and that specific hormones, each capable of raising intracellular cAMP, can result in the preferential phosphorylation of different target substrates (3Harper J.F. Haddox M.K. Johanson R. Hanley R.M. Steiner A.L. Vitam. Horm. 1985; 42: 197-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Understanding how the activation of a single signaling pathway can lead to multiple but varying cellular effects has become an important goal in cAMP signaling research. Recent work has demonstrated that both cAMP and its target kinase are specifically localized within the cell (4Adams S.R. Harootunian A.T. Buechler Y.J. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 5Joachim S. Schwoch G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 76-84PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings emphasize that PKA phosphorylation of various target substrates depends not only on whether cAMP levels are increased, but also on where within the cell this increase occurs and whether PKA and its substrates are localized at the site. cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II regulatory subunit of PKA cMP-dependent protein inase-nchoring rotein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis microtubule-associated protein-2 N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine PKA inhibitor peptide-(5-24) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Tris-buffered saline. The PKA holoenzyme consists of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits forming an inactive heterotetramer (6Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8443-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each regulatory subunit binds two cAMP molecules, causing the release of active catalytic subunits. Two classes of regulatory subunits exist, giving rise to type I and II holoenzymes. While type I PKA is generally soluble and cytoplasmic, the type II isoform is predominantly associated with the cell particulate fraction (7Rubin C.S. Rangel-Aldao R. Sarkar D. Erlichman J. Fleischer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3797-3805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type II PKA activity has been shown to be associated with a variety of subcellular structures including the plasma membrane, cystoskeleton, Golgi apparatus, and nucleus (8De Camilii P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohman S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The type II regulatory subunit (RII) mediates kinase localization via an N-terminal region absent in the type I regulatory subunit (9Luo Z. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the RII protein plays a pivotal role both in regulating type II PKA activity and in specifically localizing the type II holoenzyme within the cell. cMP-dependent protein inase-nchoring roteins (AKAPs) comprise a diverse group of proteins defined by their high affinity for RII and proposed role in mediating the attachment of type II PKA to subcellular structures (10Rubin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 11Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAPs retain their ability to bind RII following SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose (12Lohmann S.M. DeCamilli P. Einig I. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6723-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Using purified RII protein to probe blots has allowed the detection of AKAPs from a variety of tissues ranging in size from 34 to 300 kDa (13Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The RII protein has also been radiolabeled and used to screen cDNA expression libraries, allowing the primary structure of several AKAPs to be determined (14Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their diversity, AKAPs share certain structural features. It has been shown that AKAPs bind to a common site at the N terminus of the RII protein and that dimerization of the RII protein is required for binding (16Scott J.D. Stofko R.E. McDonald J.R. Comer J.D. Vitalis E.A. Mangili J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21561-21566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Critical RII-binding regions within several AKAPs have been identified and consist in each case of a single amphipathic helix (17Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A short peptide containing the RII-binding amphipathic helix of the AKAP Ht-31 has been shown to bind RII with nanomolar affinity and has been termed an “anchoring inhibitor peptide” based on its ability to competitively inhibit RII-AKAP interactions (18Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to an RII-binding domain, each AKAP is proposed to have a unique targeting domain responsible for determining the subcellular localization of type II PKA. The targeting domains of the AKAPs MAP-2 (19Joly J.C. Flynn G. Purch D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2288-2294Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), AKAP-75 (20Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and AKAP-220 (21Lester L.B. Coghlan V.M. Nauert B. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have been identified, and the locations and structures of other AKAP targeting domains are currently under investigation. Anchoring inhibitor peptides have been used in physiological experiments to demonstrate the functional importance of PKA anchoring. α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate glutamate receptor ion channels in hippocampal neurons require PKA phosphorylation for the maintenance of inward currents (22Wang L.Y. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Science. 1991; 253: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and the presence of peptides designed to disrupt RII-AKAP binding results in a diminishment of the current probably by displacing anchored PKA from the channel (23Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The importance of PKA anchoring via AKAPs has also been established in the regulation of L-type calcium channels. In skeletal muscle transverse tubules, these channels initiate muscle contraction by interacting directly with ryanodine receptors to cause the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (24Catterall W.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 871-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The calcium entering directly through L-type calcium channels, on the other hand, is thought to be important in regulating the force of contraction. High frequency stimulation of muscle fibers causes potentiation of skeletal muscle calcium channel activity, an effect that may mediate the increased force of muscle contraction during tetanus (25Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This frequency- and voltage-dependent potentiation of calcium channel activity has been shown to require phosphorylation by PKA since an inhibitor peptide of PKA blocks the effect (25Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recent electrophysiological studies have shown that this effect requires the anchoring of PKA near the channel. The introduction of an anchoring inhibitor peptide into skeletal muscle myotubes via the recording pipette eliminates potentiation in skeletal muscle myotubes, presumably by displacing PKA from an endogenous AKAP (26Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate receptor and L-type calcium channel therefore provide two examples demonstrating the physiological importance of PKA anchoring. The electrophysiological evidence that PKA is anchored to the L-type calcium channel complements biochemical studies. It was demonstrated that an endogenous protein kinase activity co-purifies with the calcium channel through several chromatographic steps, suggesting that it might be physically associated with the channel (27Murphy B.J. Tuana B.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 560: 391-394Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify this co-purifying kinase as PKA and show that it is physically linked to the channel. Furthermore, we have identified a previously undescribed 15-kDa AKAP that is linked to the L-type calcium channel and may mediate its association with PKA. 10-20% Tricine gels and molecular weight markers were obtained from Novex (San Diego, CA). cAMP, cAMP-agarose, protein A-Sepharose, and MAP-2 were purchased from Sigma.

DSDD peptide (RRRDDDSDDD) was a gift from Ed Krebs (University of Washington). Skeletal muscle calcium channels were purified as described by Curtis and Catterall (28Curtis B.M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2113-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) from skeletal muscle microsomes prepared according to Fernandez et al. (29Fernandez J. Rosenblatt M. Hidalgo C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 599: 552-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All buffers contained the following protease inhibitors: 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), leupeptin (2 μM), pepstatin A (1 μM), antipain (1.6 μM), calpain inhibitor I (10 μg/ml), calpain inhibitor II (10 μg/ml), and o-phenanthroline (0.9 mM). The picomoles of purified calcium channel were estimated by assuming a molecular mass of 429 kDa for the channel complex. Purified calcium channels were phosphorylated by incubation at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.15 μM [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for the times indicated. Calcium channel phosphorylation reactions were terminated by heating at 65°C for 3 min in 80 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 2% SDS and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In some cases, individual phosphoprotein bands were excised from the gels, and 32P was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Purified synthetic peptides were phosphorylated by incubation at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP (80 mCi/mmol) for 10 min in the presence of 1-5 pmol of purified calcium channel. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by acidification to 16% acetic acid, spotted on P-81 paper, washed with 0.1% phosphoric acid, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The expression plasmid pET11d containing the mouse RIIα cDNA (30Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen). The RIIα vector was kindly provided by John Scott (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University). 25-ml overnight cultures were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LBA) and used to inoculate 1 liter of LBA. Cells were then grown by shaking at 37°C until the A550 of the 1-liter culture reached 0.300. Expression of RII was subsequently induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for an additional 2.5 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2200 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 20 ml of 10 mM MOPS (pH 6.9), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol containing aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μM), o-phenanthroline (0.2 mg/ml), 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), and benzamidine (15.7 μg/ml) (lysis buffer). Resuspended cells were lysed by mild sonication with a probe sonicator for 30 s on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were discarded, and 10 g of ammonium sulfate were added to the supernatant while stirring on ice to achieve 80% saturation. Stirring on ice was continued for 15 min to allow protein precipitation to reach equilibrium, and precipitated proteins were separated from soluble material by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were discarded, and ammonium sulfate precipitates were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 μM isobutylmethylxanthine in addition to the protease inhibitors listed above. Resuspended material was mixed with 5 ml of cAMP-agarose and rotated for 16 h at 4°C. Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the cAMP-agarose with 50 ml of lysis buffer, followed by washing with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 M NaCl and finally washing again with 50 ml of lysis buffer. Bound RII protein was eluted by incubating cAMP-agarose with 15 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mM free cAMP for 30 min at room temperature. The eluate was concentrated by centrifugation in a Centriprep 30 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified recombinant RII was biotinylated by dialyzing 0.5 ml of pure RII protein (0.5-1.5 mg/ml) against 2 liters of 50 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) for 2-4 h. EZ™ sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate was then added at a 10-fold molar ratio over protein and incubated on ice for 2 h. Excess unreacted biotin was removed by dialysis overnight against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.15 M NaCl (TBS). SDS-PAGE was carried out under reducing conditions on 10-20% polyacrylamide-Tris/Tricine gels. Electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes was carried out in a Novex Xcell II apparatus for 2.5 h at 195 mA (constant current) with 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol (pH 8.3) as the transfer buffer. Unbound sites were blocked either for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4°C with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder or 10% normal horse serum in TBS. Blots were blocked in 10% normal horse serum only prior to detection of RII, which involved the use of an anti-goat antibody that cross-reacted with proteins from milk, but not horse serum. For AKAP detection, blocked membranes were washed three times for 10 min each with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated for 1 h with 5 nM RII-biotin with or without a 30-min room temperature preincubation with 0.4 μM HT-31 or HT-31-P peptide in TBST. Membranes were then washed three times for 10 min each with TBST and incubated for 30 min with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-linked avidin in TBST. Blots were washed three times for 10 min each with TBST, and reactive bands were visualized using the Pierce Supersignal™ ECL detection system. For RII detection, nitrocellulose membranes blocked in horse serum were incubated for 1 h with a goat anti-RII antibody (kindly provided by John Scott, Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University), followed by a 30-min incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Detection was via ECL, and TBST washes were included between steps as described above. Electrotransferred calcium channel was detected following a 1-h incubation with the rabbit anti-CP11 peptide antibody directed against the C-terminal region of the α1 subunit, followed by a 30-min incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked protein A, ECL, and film exposure. Approximately 10 pmol of calcium channel, purified as described above, were incubated with 20 μg of anti-CP11 antibody or control antibody for 2 h at 4°C in a final volume of 0.5 ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 75 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% digitonin (Buffer A). Each 0.5-ml reaction was added to 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose beads containing precipitated complexes were washed three times with 1 ml Buffer A, and associated proteins were either used in endogenous phosphorylation experiments as described above or eluted following incubation in SDS sample buffer for 15 min at 65°C. SDS-eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for AKAPs as described above. Incubation of purified calcium channels with [γ-32P]ATP followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures” yielded three prominent phosphoprotein bands of ∼170, 65, and 60 kDa, with a less prominent band appearing at 90 kDa (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1A also shows that the phosphorylation of these proteins by the endogenous kinase increased over time. To identify the three phosphorylated proteins, we performed immunoblotting experiments on identical purified calcium channel preparations. The 170-kDa phosphoprotein seen in Fig. 1A displayed the same apparent mobility as the α1 subunit of the calcium channel recognized by anti-CP11 antibody (Fig. 1B, first lane). The 65-kDa phosphoprotein was similarly identified as the β subunit of the calcium channel based on comparison with the migration of the β subunit as recognized by a β subunit-specific antibody (Fig. 1B, second lane). Finally, the ∼60-kDa phosphoprotein was identified as RII as its gel position was the same as that of the RII protein recognized by RII-specific antibodies (Fig. 1B, third lane). The faint band at ∼90 kDa was not identified and may represent a degradation product of the calcium channel α1 subunit. The presence of RII in purified calcium channel preparations as well as the fact that the calcium channel is a known substrate for PKA (31Curtis B.M. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) led us to test whether the endogenous kinase was in fact PKA. Fig. 2A demonstrates the effect of cAMP on the endogenous kinase activity as measured by phosphorylation of the calcium channel α1 subunit. The endogenous kinase activity was stimulated following the addition of cAMP. This experiment was repeated five times, and in each case, cAMP stimulated the phosphorylation of the α1 subunit. cAMP-dependent stimulation ranged from ∼1.5 to 3-fold. We further established the identity of the kinase present in calcium channel preparations using specific kinase substrate and inhibitor peptides. Fig. 2B shows that the endogenous kinase phosphorylated the known PKA substrate SP48 (32Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation of this peptide was stimulated by the addition of cAMP. cAMP consistently (n = 5) increased the phosphorylation of SP48, with the stimulation ranging from ∼2.5 to 8-fold. In addition, PKI-(5-24) completely blocked the cAMP-stimulated kinase activity (Fig. 2B). PKI-(5-24), however, did not completely block all endogenous protein kinase activity. The endogenous kinase activity failed to phosphorylate peptides that are substrates for PKC and casein kinase II (Fig. 2B). Together, these data strongly suggest that PKA is co-purifying with the calcium channel. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to test whether the co-purifying kinase is physically associated with the calcium channel. The channel was first immunoprecipitated from calcium channel preparations with the α1 subunit-specific anti-CP11 antibody and then incubated under phosphorylating conditions with [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 3A shows that following immunoprecipitation and addition of [γ-32P]ATP, both the α1 and β subunits of the calcium channel were phosphorylated by a co-precipitating kinase. The PKA substrate peptide SP48 was also phosphorylated by the immunoprecipitated calcium channel complex (Fig. 3B). When the immunoprecipitation was performed with a control antibody (IgG), phosphorylation of the peptide was not detected (Fig. 3B). Therefore, based on co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the calcium channel is physically associated with a co-purifying kinase. Recombinant RII protein expressed, purified, and biotinylated as described under “Experimental Procedures” was employed in an RII overlay assay adapted from the procedure of Lohmann et al. (12Lohmann S.M. DeCamilli P. Einig I. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6723-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Pure MAP-2 protein resolved by SDS-PAGE and immobilized on nitrocellulose was probed with RII-biotin and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-linked avidin and ECL as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 4 demonstrates that RII-biotin can be used in an overlay assay to detect the AKAP MAP-2. Preincubation of RII-biotin with a 24-amino acid anchoring inhibitor peptide (HT-31) derived from the AKAP Ht-31 (18Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prevented recognition of MAP-2, indicating a specific RII-AKAP interaction (Fig. 4). HT-31-P is a control proline-substituted peptide derived from HT-31 that does not bind RII (18Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of RII-biotin with HT-31-P peptide did not prevent recognition of MAP-2 (Fig. 4). Thus, RII-biotin binds to AKAPs in a specific manner in an overlay assay. The protein detected at ∼70 kDa is likely a degradation product of full-length MAP-2 in the commercial preparation. Proteins present in purified calcium channel preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and screened for AKAPs using the RII-biotin overlay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Fig. 5, we identify a 15-kDa AKAP that co-purified with the calcium channel. Preincubation of RII-biotin with HT-31 peptide abolished recognition of AKAP-15, while preincubation with the control HT-31-P peptide did not affect recognition (Fig. 5). Together, these data demonstrate the presence of a previously undescribed RII-binding protein present in purified calcium channel preparations, which we designate AKAP-15. To demonstrate a physical association between AKAP-15 and the calcium channel, we immunoprecipitated the calcium channel with anti-CP11 antibody and assayed for the co-precipitation of AKAP-15. The calcium channel and associated proteins precipitated from calcium channel preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for the presence of AKAP-15 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 6 shows the presence of AKAP-15 among precipitated proteins as detected by the RII-biotin overlay assay. Detection of AKAP-15 was prevented by preincubation of RII-biotin with HT-31 peptide (Fig. 6). Moreover, AKAP-15 was not detected when a control antibody (IgG) was employed in place of anti-CP11 antibody (Fig. 6). Co-immunoprecipitation of AKAP-15 with the calcium channel confirms its physical association with the calcium channel complex. Skeletal muscle L-type calcium channel activity is enhanced by PKA phosphorylation (25Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

While the precise sites responsible for physiological modulation of calcium channel activity by PKA phosphorylation have not been identified, it is likely that critical sites lie on the α1 and/or β subunit of the calcium channel. In this study, we have identified an endogenous kinase activity that co-purifies with the calcium channel. We have further provided evidence that this co-purifying kinase is PKA and that it is physically associated with the channel complex. Using a novel RII-biotin overlay assay, we have detected an AKAP of ∼15 kDa that also co-purifies and co-immunoprecipitates with the calcium channel. Together, these results suggest a role for AKAP-15 in anchoring type II PKA to the calcium channel and thereby allowing discrete phosphorylation of the channel in response to cAMP. Our results are consistent with previous physiological experiments demonstrating a close association between L-type calcium channels and PKA (26Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent phosphorylation by PKA increases the subsequent activity of the calcium channel (25Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This voltage-dependent potentiation represents a measurable effect of PKA on calcium channels in intact cells and has been used to assess the requirement of kinase anchoring. Johnson et al. (26Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showed that the AKAP-derived anchoring inhibitor peptide (HT-31) that disrupts RII-AKAP interactions completely blocks voltage-dependent potentiation of calcium channels in skeletal muscle myotubes. Blockade of voltage-dependent potentiation by disruption of anchoring was overcome by the introduction of excess catalytic subunit of PKA into cells at concentrations high enough to obviate the requirement for specific localization of PKA near the calcium channel (26Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ability of HT-31 peptide to block potentiation of the calcium channel by PKA strongly suggests that PKA is anchored near the channel by an AKAP. Our experiments are consistent with this hypothesis and suggest that AKAP-15 mediates the anchoring of PKA near the calcium channel. The kinase activity we detect in purified calcium channel preparations resembles PKA in several respects. Our initial observation shows that this activity phosphorylates three PKA substrates, the α1 and β subunits of the calcium channel as well as RII. The endogenous kinase activity is also stimulated by cAMP, and the stimulated activity is inhibited by PKI(5-24). We measured the phosphorylation of various substrate peptides by the endogenous kinase and found that the PKA substrate SP48 was phosphorylated, while SP44, DSDD, PKC, and casein kinase II substrates, respectively, were not. Furthermore, two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the skeletal muscle calcium channel α1 subunit phosphorylated by either exogenous PKA or the endogenous kinase were similar (data not shown). While we believe we have identified PKA, it is important to note that we were unable to completely block the endogenous kinase activity with PKI(5-24), indicating that there may also be another kinase in these preparations. The endogenous kinase activity not only co-purifies with the calcium channel, but co-immunoprecipitates with it as well. This result indicates that the kinase and calcium channel are physically linked to each other and provided the impetus to examine purified calcium channel preparations for AKAPs. Various approaches to detect AKAPs have been described, each involving the use of purified RII protein in an overlay assay (40Carr D.W. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this study, we have introduced a variation of the RII overlay using biotinylated RII. This new assay, which involves detection of RII-biotin with peroxidase-conjugated avidin, has proven faster and easier than detection with antibodies or with radiolabeled RII. We validated the RII-biotin overlay by using it to detect the known AKAP MAP-2. Preincubation of RII-biotin with an AKAP-derived anchoring inhibitor peptide (HT-31) prevented MAP-2 recognition, indicating that this is a specific RII-AKAP interaction. In addition to its usefulness in detecting AKAPs, we anticipate that RII-biotin will serve as a useful affinity reagent for purification of AKAPs. Using the RII-biotin overlay, we have identified a novel 15-kDa AKAP in purified calcium channel preparations that we believe mediates the association of PKA and the calcium channel. Detection of AKAP-15 is blocked by preincubation of RII-biotin with HT-31 peptide, consistent with it being an AKAP. Co-purification of AKAP-15 with the calcium channel suggests that these two proteins are physically associated. We confirmed this association by co-immunoprecipitating AKAP-15 using a calcium channel-specific anti-peptide antibody. AKAP-15 was not co-precipitated by a control antibody, and its detection was blocked by preincubation of RII-biotin with HT-31 peptide. AKAP-15 is the only RII-binding protein we detected in purified calcium channel preparations, making it an excellent candidate for mediating the role of attaching PKA to the calcium channel complex. Unlike many AKAPs, which remain poorly characterized with respect to their specific targets and functional importance, AKAP-15 possesses both a likely target (L-type calcium channels) and functional importance (voltage-dependent potentiation). Purification and characterization of this AKAP may allow determination of its role in anchoring PKA to the calcium channel."

MDC 15 mRNA is expressed at higher levels in HUVECs than in SMCs. In cultured SMCs, MDC 15 mRNA levels are not regulated by PDGF or IGF-I or by adherence to different extracellular matrices. Nor is regulation of MDC 15 mRNA levels observed in HUVEC monolayers at different cell densities, after multi-scratch wounding, or after treatment with TNF-alpha, LPS, or thrombin. However, differences in proteolytic processing of MDC 15 are observed in different HUVEC strains. In contrast to cultured arterial cells, MDC 15 protein is not expressed in vivo in normal vessels, but is up-regulated in lesions of atherosclerosis.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27840-27846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), although itself monomeric and incapable of inducing dimerization of its receptor, forms a multivalent complex with heparan sulfate proteoglycans that can in turn bind to two or more receptors and thus stabilize active FGF receptor dimers (12Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In the process of our investigations of the mechanisms of growth factor-induced dimerization of receptor tyrosine kinases, we have studied the binding of stem cell factor (SCF) to the extracellular domain of its receptor, Kit, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase with similarity to the receptors for colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and PDGF (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). Kit contains a ligand-binding extracellular domain of 520 amino acids, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Like CSF-1 and PDGF, SCF is dimeric in solution (13Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.W. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L. Zsebo K.M. Mendiaz E.A. Wypych J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18942-18948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and has been shown to induce the dimerization of both the full-length Kit receptor (with resulting activation) and the isolated Kit extracellular domain (14Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10866-10873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15970-15977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with the PDGF and CSF-1 receptors, the Kit extracellular domain consists of five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. The first three of these domains are primarily responsible for SCF binding to Kit, as shown in interspecies domain swapping experiments (16Lev S. Blechman J. Nishikawa S.-I. Givol D. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and studies of monoclonal antibodies that inhibit SCF binding (17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Brizzi M.F. Leitner O. Pegoraro L. Givol D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4399-4406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining two Ig-like domains have been proposed to play a role in stabilizing the SCF-induced Kit dimer (18Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A mechanism for Kit activation has been proposed in which monovalent binding of SCF to a single molecule of Kit induces a conformational change in the receptor that in turn exposes a receptor dimerization site (15Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15970-15977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was further reported (18Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that the fourth Ig-like domain of Kit represents the key ligand-induced receptor dimerization site. Monoclonal antibodies against this domain inhibited SCF-induced Kit activation; deletion of the fourth domain abolished Kit function (and reduced SCF binding); and a form of the Kit extracellular domain containing only the first three Ig-like domains did not form cross-linked dimers upon SCF treatment. In most studies, growth factor receptor dimerization has been analyzed in intact cells or in detergent-solubilized preparations, using approaches such as covalent cross-linking and antibody inhibition that do not permit a quantitative analysis. We have generated large quantities of the extracellular domains of several growth factor receptors for structural studies, but have so far been unable to obtain sufficiently good crystals for x-ray crystallographic analysis. In the absence of a detailed structural view of growth factor-induced receptor dimerization, we have used several biophysical methods to explore this process. In this report, we describe studies of SCF binding to the isolated Kit extracellular domain, using titration calorimetry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and size-exclusion chromatography. We show that one bivalent SCF dimer binds simultaneously to two molecules of Kit, and thus induces its dimerization. By contrast with the findings of Blechman et al (18Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we find that a version of Kit containing just the first three Ig-like domains (Kit-123) binds to SCF and dimerizes in an manner identical to that seen with the complete extracellular domain (Kit-12345). Our data provide further evidence for the importance of SCF bivalence in Kit dimerization, through an explicit measurement of binding stoichiometry, and refute the proposal that a significant ligand-induced Kit dimerization site is present in the fourth Ig-like domain of Kit. cDNA encoding amino acids 1-141 of human SCF was subcloned into pET11a (Novagen) and expressed in Escherichia coli MGT7. After cell lysis, SCF in the insoluble pellet fraction was solubilized with 8 M urea, from which it was refolded by dilution in the presence of 1 mM reduced glutathione essentially as described by Langley et al. (19Langley K.E. Wypych J. Mendiaz E.A. Clogston C.L. Parker V.P. Farrar D.H. Brothers M.O. Stygal V.N. Leslie I. Birkett N.C. Smith K.A. Baltera R.F. Lyons D.E. Hogan J.M. Crandall C. Boone T.C. Pope J.A. Karkare S.B. Zsebo K.M. Sachdev R.K. Lu H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The refolded material was purified by anion exchange chromatography in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using a FastFlow Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia) column in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl. The resulting material was better than 95% pure as assessed by Coomassie staining of an overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For expression of Kit-12345 (residues 1-520) and Kit-123 (residues 1-319), stop codons were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at the desired positions in the cDNA encoding human c-Kit. Mutated Kit cDNA fragments were then subcloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of the BlueBac III baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen), and plasmid was cotransfected with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) into Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant virus stocks were amplified using HighFive cells (Invitrogen) to yield a high titer virus stock. Protein was secreted into medium by Sf9 cells infected with this virus stock for 48-72 h. Kit extracellular domains were then purified from conditioned medium using immunoaffinity chromatography (for Kit-12345) or a column containing SCF on CnBr-activated beads (for Kit-123). Kit protein was eluted using ActiSep, dialyzed exhaustively against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and further purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column followed by gel filtration using a Superose-12 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia). The final protein product was seen to be greater than 95% pure in each case by Coomassie staining of overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically, using calculated molar extinction coefficients (9970 M−1 cm−1 for SCF, 36800 M−1 cm−1 for Kit-123 and 68250 M−1 cm−1 for Kit-12345). Quantitative amino acid analysis of several samples with known absorbance showed these values to be correct to within 10%. The OMEGA instrument from MicroCal (20Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) was used, to which access was kindly provided by Professor Julian Sturtevant (Department of Chemistry, Yale University). Titrations were performed at 25°C in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, against which both SCF and Kit protein had been exhaustively dialyzed prior to titration. Controls for heats of dilution were performed as described previously (21Lemmon M.A. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5070-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and found to remain constant throughout each titration. Values for the heat of dilution were subtracted from the heats measured in each titration prior to fitting the data. The value for [sites]/KD (c value) in each experiment was between 20 and 60. Experimental titration curves were fit using ORIGIN software (MicroCal) as described elsewhere (20Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar), assuming a single class of binding site as indicated by the data. All experiments were performed at 25°C in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Dynamic light scattering experiments employed the Protein Solutions instrument, to which access was kindly provided by Prof. Rashmi Hegde (Skirball Institute). Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Bio-Sil SEC 250 column (300 × 7.8 mm) with a Bio-Sil guard column (80 × 7.8 mm) (Bio-Rad) attached to an LKB high performance liquid chromatography system, running at 0.5 ml/min. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments employed the XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) in the laboratory of Professor Steven K. Burley (Rockefeller University), kindly aided by Elaine Halay. Concentration distributions were monitored at 230, 260, or 280 nm. Experiments were performed at 25°C using six-channel cells at three different speeds (8500, 10200, and 10500 rpm) with identical results. Kit-123 and SCF were analyzed separately at the concentrations shown in Table II. For analysis of the SCF·Kit-123 complex, an equimolar mixture of the two components was run at the Kit-123 concentrations noted. Samples were equilibrated at each speed for greater than 18 h. Protein partial specific volumes were estimated from their amino acid compositions (0.74 ml/g for SCF, and 0.715 ml/g for Kit-123, assuming approximately 15% (w/w) oligosaccharide), and solvent density was taken as 1.003 g/ml. Data were fit using the Optima XL-A data analysis software (Beckman/MicroCal). In each case, a fit to a single ideal species gave the most randomly scattered residuals.Table II.SCF-induced dimerization of Kit-123 monitored in sedimentation equilibrium experimentsProteinConcentrationMolecular massaMolecular masses are based upon a fit to a single ideal species using the Optima XL-A data analysis software.

Open table in a new tab Using a baculovirus expression system we have generated and purified milligram quantities of the complete extracellular domain of human Kit (Kit-12345), as well as a form from which Ig-like domains 4 and 5 have been removed (Kit-123) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Human SCF (1-141) was expressed in E. coli, using a T7 expression system, and was refolded and purified using a procedure described by Langley et al. (19Langley K.E. Wypych J. Mendiaz E.A. Clogston C.L. Parker V.P. Farrar D.H. Brothers M.O. Stygal V.N. Leslie I. Birkett N.C. Smith K.A. Baltera R.F. Lyons D.E. Hogan J.M. Crandall C. Boone T.C. Pope J.A. Karkare S.B. Zsebo K.M. Sachdev R.K. Lu H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Binding of SCF to the two different forms of the Kit extracellular domain was studied using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). SCF-induced dimerization of Kit was also monitored, using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical ultracentrifugation, chemical cross-linking and dynamic light scattering. We find that both Kit-12345 and Kit-123 behave identically with respect to both SCF binding and their resulting dimerization. A single bivalent SCF dimer binds simultaneously to two molecules of Kit-12345 or Kit-123, resulting in dimerization of the receptor extracellular domain. Before proceeding with an analysis of ligand-induced receptor dimerization, it is important to determine the oligomeric state of the ligand and the receptor extracellular domains under the experimental conditions employed. Using SEC and analytical ultracentrifugation, we found that both unliganded Kit-12345 and unliganded Kit-123 behave as monomers of their expected molecular weight (plus mass of carbohydrate), and that free SCF (1-141) behaves as a dimer of 28 kDa, as expected (see Table II and Fig. 2). ITC was used to monitor SCF binding to Kit-12345. The data obtained upon titration of SCF into a solution of Kit-12345 (present in the calorimeter cell) demonstrate the existence of a single class of thermodynamically equivalent binding sites (Fig. 1, upper panel). Since heat is released throughout the titration, the binding reaction is exothermic (ΔH = −8.7 kcal·mol−1) and predominantly enthalpy-driven at 25°C. Fitting of several titrations such as that in Fig. 1 gave an apparent binding constant (KB) for SCF binding to Kit-12345 of 1.8 × 107M−1 (KD(app) = 55 nM) (Table I), and a stoichiometry of 1:1 (SCF:Kit-12345). Since SCF is a dimer under the conditions of this experiment, this measured stoichiometry requires that a single dimer of SCF binds simultaneously to two molecules of Kit-12345, thus inducing Kit-12345 dimerization. Identical titrations were obtained when the experiment was reversed, with Kit-12345 being titrated into a solution of SCF (not shown). The apparent KD reported here (55 nM) is higher (by around 20-fold) than values reported for SCF binding to Kit on the surface of cells (KD≈ 2 nM) (15Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10866-10873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar differences occur with other receptors, for example those for aFGF (12Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I.

Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) when ligand binding to the extracellular domain (free in solution) is compared with binding to the intact receptor. There are several likely explanations for this difference. Studies of SCF binding to intact Kit have required the interpretation of nonlinear Scatchard plots (15Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15970-15977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lev S. Blechman J. Nishikawa S.-I. Givol D. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which is plagued with quantitative difficulties (23Zierler K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 314-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Klotz I.M. Science. 1982; 217: 1247-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The fact that the ligand in this case (SCF) is also bivalent creates further difficulties in interpretation (25Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995: 104-107Google Scholar) that have not been adequately addressed. In addition to these considerations, the apparent affinity will be elevated by an avidity effect that arises from the high local concentration of receptor when restricted to the cell membrane or immobilized artificially. Furthermore, each of the binding events is coupled to receptor dimerization, and it can readily be shown that dimerization of membrane-localized receptors is greatly favored over their association when tumbling freely in solution (26Grasberger B. Minton A.P. DeLisi C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is expected that the apparent KD for ligand interacting with the free receptor extracellular domain will be higher than that for binding to the membrane-localized receptor. In studies similar to those reported here, Philo et al. (27Philo J.S. Wen J. Wypych J. Schwartz M.G. Mendiaz E.A. Langley K.E. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Identical ITC studies were repeated for Kit-123. Titrations of SCF into Kit-123, and of Kit-123 into a solution of SCF, gave binding isotherms that were indistinguishable from those obtained with Kit-12345 (Fig. 1, lower panel). KD(app) for this interaction was 49.2 nM, ΔH was −10.2 kcal·mol−1, and the stoichiometry was close to 1:1 (SCF:Kit-123). These thermodynamic parameters are indistinguishable from those obtained with Kit-12345 (Table I). Therefore, removal of Ig-like domains 4 and 5 from the Kit extracellular domain has no influence upon the thermodynamics of SCF binding. This result is in agreement with the reports that Ig-like domains 1-3 are of primary importance in ligand binding to Kit (16Lev S. Blechman J. Nishikawa S.-I. Givol D. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Brizzi M.F. Leitner O. Pegoraro L. Givol D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4399-4406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shows that domains 4 and 5 do not contribute at all. However, since SCF binding is coupled to the dimerization of both Kit-12345 and −123 (see below), our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis (18Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that Ig-like domains 4 and/or 5 contribute in a significant way to SCF-induced Kit dimerization. To further test our interpretation of the ITC results for SCF binding to Kit-12345, we used chemical cross-linking and SEC to monitor dimerization of the receptor extracellular domain upon ligand binding.

https://openalex.org/W2165613108,"Alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli (a homodimeric protein found in the periplasmic space) contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys-168-Cys-178 and Cys-286-Cys-336) that are formed after export to the periplasmic space. The location-specific folding character of this enzyme allowed its wide usage as a reporter of protein localization in prokaryotic cells. To study the roles of disulfide bonds in alkaline phosphatase, we eliminated each of them by Cys to Ser mutations. Intracellular stability of alkaline phosphatase decreased in the absence of either one or both of the disulfide bonds. The mutant proteins were stabilized in a DegP protease-deficient strain, allowing accumulation at significant levels and subsequent characterization. A mutant protein that lacked the N-terminally located disulfide bond (Cys-168-Cys-178) was found to have Cys-286 and Cys-336 residues disulfide-bonded, to have a dimeric structure, and to have almost full enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, the mutant protein lost the trypsin-resistant conformation that is characteristically observed for the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, mutants lacking Cys-286 and Cys-336 were monomeric and inactive. These results indicate that the Cys-286-Cys-336 disulfide bond is required and is sufficient for correctly positioning the active site region of this enzyme, but such an active conformation is still insufficient for the conformational stability of the enzyme. Thus, a fully active state of this enzyme can be formed without full protein stability, and the two disulfide bonds differentially contribute to these properties.

A mutant protein that lacked the N-terminally located disulfide bond (Cys-168-Cys-178) was found to have Cys-286 and Cys-336 residues disulfide-bonded, to have a dimeric structure, and to have almost full enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, the mutant protein lost the trypsin-resistant conformation that is characteristically observed for the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, mutants lacking Cys-286 and Cys-336 were monomeric and inactive. These results indicate that the Cys-286-Cys-336 disulfide bond is required and is sufficient for correctly positioning the active site region of this enzyme, but such an active conformation is still insufficient for the conformational stability of the enzyme. Thus, a fully active state of this enzyme can be formed without full protein stability, and the two disulfide bonds differentially contribute to these properties. Differential in vivo roles played by DsbA and DsbC in the formation of protein disulfide bonds.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 273Issue 42PreviewPlasmid pMS002 and its derivatives used in the above two publications proved to contain an additional mutation for a Ser-401 → Cys substitution within PhoA. We traced this mutation back to the phoA plasmid (provided by others) that was used to substitute the amplified segment, as described in the first publication (page 6174, “Experimental Procedures”). Given this fact, we eliminated this unwanted mutation from most of the plasmid constructions and repeated key experiments presented in both publications. Full-Text PDF Open Access Alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) is a periplasmic enzyme of Escherichia coli It is a zinc- and magnesium-containing enzyme consisting of two identical subunits encoded by the phoA gene (1Chang C.N. Kuang W.-J. Chen E.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Each of the subunits contains two intramolecular disulfide bridges, Cys-168-Cys-178 and Cys-286-Cys-336 (2Bradshaw R.A. Cancedda F. Ericsson L.H. Neumann P.E. Piccoli S.P. Schlesinger M.J. Shriefer K. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PhoA is initially synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal 20-residue signal sequence that is removed during translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. The mature 450-residue (or 449 when the N-terminal arginine residue is removed; Ref. 2Bradshaw R.A. Cancedda F. Ericsson L.H. Neumann P.E. Piccoli S.P. Schlesinger M.J. Shriefer K. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) part of PhoA is then oxidized for its cysteine residues to form the disulfide bridges and is folded into a partially protease-resistant conformation (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunit folding process is then followed by dimerization into the active metalloenzyme. This pathway of enzyme formation is completed within 2-3 min at 15°C in the living cell (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processes of folding/assembly of PhoA occur only after export to the periplasmic space (4Boyd D. Willard S. Guan C.-D. Wright W. Beckwith J. Torriani-Gorini A. Rothman F.G. Silver S. Wright A. Yagil E. Phosphate Metabolism and Cellular Regulation in Microorganisms. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 89-93Google Scholar“6Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This property of PhoA has enabled its wide usage as a reporter of protein localization and membrane protein topology in prokaryotic cells (7Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 8Manoil C. Mekalanos J.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 515-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide bonds is a crucial event that triggers the correct folding of PhoA. In the cytoplasm, thioredoxin reductase and other factors seem to prevent disulfide bond formation on proteins (9Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In the periplasm, the Dsb system facilitates disulfide bond formation (10Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 11Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It has been established that a periplasmic factor (DsbA) directly catalyzes oxidation of cysteines (12Akiyama Y. Kamitani S. Kusukawa N. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22440-22445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound factor DsbB is believed to reoxidize the reduced form of DsbA to allow it to function catalytically (14Bardwell J.C.A. Lee J. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl.

Although biochemical studies on denaturation-renaturation as well as subunit association processes of PhoA were conducted previously (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), the roles of the two disulfide bonds have not been precisely defined. In view of the importance of the disulfide bond formation for the formation of active PhoA enzyme, it is important to assign roles to each disulfide bond in the activity and stability of the enzyme. Thus, we have undertaken site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues of PhoA and examined the properties of the resulting mutant forms of the enzyme. The results show that the two disulfide bonds have different roles. Cys-286-Cys-336 was found to be required and was sufficient for the formation of the enzymatically active conformation, but was insufficient for supporting the protease-resistant structure, which proved to require Cys-168-Cys-178 as well. Thus, a fully active state of this enzyme can be formed without having the full stability of the protein. E. coli strains KS272 (ΔphoA) and KS474 (ΔphoA degP41::Tn5) were described by Strauch and Beckwith (25Strauch K.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Strains MS3 and MS5 were derivatives of KS272 and KS474, respectively, into which F′lacIQ lacPL8 lacZ+Y+A+ pro+ plasmid had been introduced from strain KI267 (26Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strains BW313 (27Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) and MV1184 (28Messing J. Vieira J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) were used for site-directed mutagenesis. pMS002 was a derivative of pBluescript-SK(−) carrying the phoA gene under the control of the lac promoter. It was constructed as follows. A polymerase chain reaction product was donated by N. Kusukawa of Takara Shuzo in which the phoA region of the chromosome was amplified using primers 5′GAAACAAAGCACTATTGC (starting at the third nucleotide of phoA) and 5′GTGATCTGCCATTAAGTC (starting at the 75th nucleotide after the end of the phoA reading frame). It was treated with the Klenow enzyme and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript-SK(−). To eliminate any possible mutations introduced by polymerase chain reaction, a 1.4-kilobase pair BclI-KpnI fragment (representing most of the mature PhoA and some of the vector sequence) was replaced with the corresponding BclI-KpnI fragment that was prepared from a plasmid carrying the phoA gene of the confirmed sequence 1N. Kusukawa, unpublished data. in which the phoA mature sequence had been similarly cloned at the EcoRV site of pT7Blue-Vector (Novagen). The remaining 5′ part of the phoA sequence was confirmed by sequencing. In the resulting plasmid (pMS001), the initiation codon of phoA was recreated but was in the same frame as the lacZα sequence of the vector. Therefore, the PstI site at the upstream region was subjected to cleavage, filling-in by the Klenow enzyme and religation. The final product (pMS002) encodes the wild-type PhoA precursor. Cys to Ser substitution mutations of PhoA were introduced into plasmid pMS002 by the procedures described by Kunkel (27Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), using the Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Synthetic oligonucleotides used as mutagenic primers were as follows: 5′GCGCAAATACGGTC3′ for Cys-168 → Ser mutation, 5′AGTGAAAAACCGGGTA3′ for Cys-178 → Ser mutation, 5′AGTCACCACGCCAA3′ for Cys-286 → Ser mutation, and 5′GAATCCTGGGCAAA3′ for Cys-336 → Ser mutation (codons for Ser are underlined). Coding for PhoA(SCCC), 2The four-letter notations, with C for cysteine and S for serine (in parentheses), indicate the amino acid residues 168, 178, 286, and 336, in that order. pMS003 was first constructed using the Cys-168 → Ser primer. pMS004 (for PhoA(SSCC)), pMS006 (for PhoA(SSSC)), and pMS013 (for PhoA(SSCS)) were then constructed successively using appropriate primers. Similarly, pMS012 (for PhoA(CCSC)), pMS014 (for PhoA(CCCS)), and pMS015 (for PhoA(CCSS)) were constructed individually or in sequence. pMS016 (for PhoA(SSSS)) was constructed by replacing the EcoT14I-KpnI segment of pMS004 with that of pMS015. All the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cells were grown at 37°C to an exponential phase in M9 medium (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glycerol and 20 μg/ml each of amino acids, except methionine and cysteine. The phoA gene under the lac promoter control was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside. After 15 min, cells were pulse-labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1100 Ci/mmol, obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals) followed by chase with unlabeled L-methionine (200 μg/ml) for indicated periods. A portion of the culture was treated with trichloroacetic acid, and protein precipitates were dissolved in SDS for subsequent immunoprecipitation as described previously (11Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Anti-PhoA serum was purchased from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO. Radioactive proteins were visualized and quantitated using a Bioimaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film) in combination with a Discovery Series Densitometer (PDI). Cells of MS5 that carried a phoA plasmid were grown at 37°C in L-broth containing 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside and 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an exponential phase (turbidity of 40 as measured by a Klett colorimeter with filter no. 54), mixed with a final concentration of 1 mM iodoacetamide, pelleted by centrifugation (placed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min), and resuspended in 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1 mM iodoacetamide (30Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3764-3770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The procedures for the enzyme assay and unit definition were as described by Manoil and Beckwith (7Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). For assessing relative accumulation of PhoA proteins by immunoblotting, a portion of each culture was mixed directly with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 5%) to precipitate whole cell proteins that were solubilized in SDS-containing solution. Two fixed culture equivalents of samples (10 and 30 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and immunoblotting using anti-PhoA serum, as described previously (31Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PhoA activities of different mutant constructions were compared after normalizing the enzyme unit by relative accumulation levels of the PhoA proteins. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To examine dimerization states of PhoA, cells of MS5 that carried a phoA plasmid were grown as described above, and the periplasmic fraction was prepared from 5 ml of culture as described previously (32Ueguchi C. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5643-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This fraction (480 μl) was layered on top of a 4.5-ml gradient of 5-20% sucrose in 10 mM Tris-HCl. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 19 h in a Beckman SW65 rotor, the gradient was fractionated into 16 fractions that were then analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting for distribution of PhoA proteins (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Periplasmic fractions were also separated by gel electrophoresis without denaturation (33Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 143-160Google Scholar), and PhoA species were detected by immunoblotting. A 200-μl portion of a culture as described above was mixed with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Protein precipitates were washed with acetone and then dissolved in SDS/Tris-HCl/iodoacetamide solution (34Pollitt S. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the absence of any reducing reagent, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PhoA serum. In some experiments, the SDS solution used was slightly different (35Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but the results were essentially not affected by this variation. Trypsin resistance of various PhoA constructions in crude cell lysates was assessed essentially as described previously (5Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that iodoacetamide was included (30Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3764-3770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overproduce these proteins, the phoA genes were cloned under the control of the ara promoter. pMS002 and pMS004 were linearized with KpnI and then partially digested with EcoRI. An approximately 1.5-kilobase fragment containing the phoA open reading frame was recovered and cloned into pBAD22 (36Guzman L. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) that had been digested with EcoRI and KpnI. The resulting plasmids (named pMS019 and pMS021, respectively, for PhoA and PhoA(SSCC)) were introduced into strain MS5. Cells were cultivated in 4 liters of M9 amino acid medium described above (except containing 0.4% arabinose), and periplasmic fractions were prepared as described previously (32Ueguchi C. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5643-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PhoA proteins were purified according to the procedure of Chaidaroglou et al. (37Chaidaroglou A. Bvezinski D.J. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8338-8343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 and 0.5 mg of proteins of at least 90% purity (as judged from the SDS-PAGE profiles) were obtained for PhoA and PhoA(SSCC), respectively. The phoA gene, cloned under the control of the lac operator/promoter on a plasmid vector, was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to construct a series of 8 mutants in which a Cys codon was converted into a Ser codon singly or in combination. For the sake of convenience, these mutant forms of PhoA are desginated by four-letter notations in which residues 168, 178, 286, and 336, are indicated by C (Cys) or S (Ser) in this order, respectively. Thus, for instance, PhoA(SSCC) indicates the PhoA mutant in which Cys residues at positions 168 and 178 have been replaced by Ser. The mutant forms of PhoA were expressed in a ΔphoA strain. All of them were found to be unstable in vivo Pulse-chase experiments showed that, in contrast to the wild-type PhoA protein (Fig. 1A), mutant forms were degraded after the synthesis (Fig. 1, B-D, closed symbols). The mutants that are not shown in Fig. 1 were similarly unstable. Their approximate half-lives were 5-10 min at 37°C. They were significantly stabilized in the degP::Tn5 mutant strain (Fig. 1, B-D, open symbols). Although some proteolysis persisted even in the degP strain (Fig. 1), it was possible to accumulate mutant forms of PhoA using this periplasmic protease-deficient strain as a host. The wild-type and mutant forms of PhoA were allowed to accumulate in the degP mutant cells, and their relative amounts were determined by subjecting whole cell extracts to SDS-PAGE and visualizing PhoA by immunoblotting. PhoA activities of the same cultures were assayed, and relative specific activities were determined by dividing the enzymatic activities by relative intensities of PhoA in the immunoblotting experiments (Table I). Only PhoA(SSCC) and PhoA(SCCC) were found to have significant enzyme activity (Table I). Since PhoA(CCSS), PhoA(CCCS), PhoA(CCSC), PhoA(SSSC), and PhoA(SSCS) were all inactive (see Table I for (CCSS); data not shown for the other mutants), the presence of both Cys-286 and Cys-336 was required for the activity. In contrast, Cys-168 and Cys-178 were dispensable for the enzymatic activity.Table I.Enzymatic activity of Cys/Ser mutants of PhoAPhoA variantCellular accumulation (relative value)aDetermined by immunoblotting and quantitation of the stains by a Discovery Series Densitometer (PDI).ActivityRelative specific activitybThe PhoA activity unit (7) was divided by the relative accumulation of the PhoA protein, and the value obtained was normalized by the wild-type value.Specific activity of purified proteincSpecific activity was indicated by the amount of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolyzed (in μmol) per min/mg of protein at 25°C and at pH 8.1.

ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab PhoA(SSCC) was as active as the wild-type enzyme (Table I), suggesting that Cys-286-Cys-336 is the sole activity-supporting disulfide bond in PhoA. To confirm this notion, PhoA and PhoA(SSCC) were overproduced and purified. Specific activities of these preparations were about the same (Table I). Interestingly, PhoA(SCCC), which contains an additional cysteine, was less active than PhoA(SSCC). We have evidence indicating that PhoA(SCCC) tends to form an aberrant disulfide bond. 4M. Sone, Y. Akiyama, and K. Ito, unpublished results. Normal PhoA sediments at about 6 S in sucrose gradient centrifugation, whereas an unfolded monomer subunit sediments at around 2 S (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Reynolds J.A. Schlesinger M.J. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 3552-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Periplasmic fractions were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and examined for sedimentation behaviors of PhoA proteins (Fig. 2). It was found that enzymatically active PhoA(SSCC) sedimented to similar fractions as the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2, compare A and B). In contrast, PhoA(CCSS) (which was inactive) sedimented much more slowly (Fig. 2C) to the position similar to that of PhoA(SSSS) (data not shown) or that of reduced and denatured PhoA (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that PhoA(SSCC), but not PhoA(CCSS), is competent for the dimer formation. The PhoA variants were also examined by PAGE at pH 8.8 under non-denaturing conditions. PhoA(SSCC) migrated to a similar position as the wild-type PhoA (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2). PhoA(CCSS) migrated much slower (Fig. 3, lane 3). PhoA(SSSS) also migrated slowly under the conditions used (data not shown). The basis for the slow migration of PhoA(CCSS) and PhoA(SSSS) is not known. It may be due to the lack of a compactly folded structure and/or different exposure of charged residues. In any case, the results of native PAGE are consistent with the notion that the overall structure of PhoA(SSCC) is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. To know whether the remaining cysteines in the mutant proteins are disulfide-bonded, we examined profiles of PhoA proteins in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Normal PhoA with two disulfide bonds migrated faster than its reduced form (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2). Electrophoretic mobility of PhoA(SSCC) was indistinguishable from that of the oxidized wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 4). After reduction with β-mercaptoethanol, all the PhoA molecules shown in Fig. 4 migrated identically at the position of the reduced wild-type PhoA protein (data not shown). Thus, Cys-286 and Cys-336 that remain in PhoA(SSCC) form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Electrophoretic mobility of PhoA(CCSS) (Fig. 4, lane 5) was indistinguishable from that of PhoA(SSSS) (Fig. 4, lane 6) or of reduced PhoA. Either Cys-168 and Cys-178 in this mutant remain reduced or the Cys-168-Cys-178 disulfide bond affects the electrophoretic mobility only negligibly. The close proximity of these residues in the primary sequence may suggest the latter possibility. It was already shown in Fig. 1 that PhoA(SSCC) was unstable in vivo Protease susceptibility of the mutant forms of PhoA was studied in vitro by trypsin digestion of cell extracts. Wild-type PhoA was resistant to up to 50 μg/ml trypsin examined (Fig. 5A, showing data for up to 10 μg/ml trypsin). PhoA(SSCC) was not resistant to even 2.5 μg/ml trypsin (Fig. 5B, lane 2). PhoA(CCSS) was not resistant to 5 μg/ml trypsin (Fig. 5C, lanes 2-5). These results show that the fully active and dimeric PhoA(SSCC) is still in loosely folded conformation. The results presented above indicate that of the two disulfide bonds in PhoA, the one between Cys-286 and Cys-336 is sufficient for the enzymatic activity. However, it is not sufficient to confer the protease-resistant conformation normally observed for this enzyme. The other disulfide bond (between Cys-168 and Cys-178) is important for stabilization of the protein. PhoA is one of the enzymes that exhibit a high degree of thermal stability and protease resistance (38Torriani A. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 12: 212-218Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Intramolecular disulfide bond formation is a prerequisite for its folding into an active dimer (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PhoA has been widely used as a reporter of protein export from the cytosol (7Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 8Manoil C. Mekalanos J.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 515-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reducing environment of the cytosol prevents folding and activation of PhoA, and thioredoxin reductase plays a key role in this prevention (6Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In contrast, the periplasmic space contains DsbA, which facilitates oxidative folding of newly synthesized proteins (10Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 11Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). PhoA molecules that are internalized because of a defect in signal sequence as well as those exported to the periplasm of a dsbA-defective mutant strain lack enzymatic activity and are degraded by cellular or exogenous proteases (4Boyd D.

Our results now show directly that only one of the disulfide bonds (Cys-286-Cys-336) is essential for enzymatically active conformation of PhoA. The active site of this enzyme contains two atoms of zinc and one of magnesium and involves at least the following amino acid residues: Asp-51, Ser-102, Asp-153, Thr-155, Arg-166, Glu-322, Asp-327, Lys-328, His-331, His-372, and His-412 (23Sowadski J.M.

The Cys-286-Cys-336 disulfide bond, which connects two different loops that originate from different β-strands, will constrain the central β-sheet (with 10 strands) so that the active site residues are arranged in proper geometric configuration (24Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In contrast, the conformational constraint imposed by the Cys-168-Cys-178 disulfide bond is limited within a single loop. Such a restriction may be trivial with respect to the formation of an active site and dimerization, but should be important for establishing a tight overall or local folding state that is crucial for the resistance of this enzyme to the action of proteases. The finding that the Cys-168-Cys-178 disulfide bond is required for the tight folding without a major contribution to the active site formation (Table I) may corroborate the proposal (40Shoichet B.K. Baase W.A. Kuroki R. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) that the acquisition of a catalytic ability of a protein is often made possible at the expense of stability of the protein. By making a disulfide bridge, the Cys-168 and Cys-178 residues may have evolved to overcome such an intrinsic incompatibility between activity and stability of the enzyme. Subramaniam et al.

Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding Spα, a secreted protein that is highly homologous to CD5 and CD6. Spα has the same domain organization as the extracellular region of CD5 and CD6 and is composed of three SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine rich) domains. Chromosomal mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid panel analysis indicated that the gene encoding Spα is located on the long arm of human chromosome 1 at q21-q23 within contig WC1.17. RNA transcripts encoding Spα were found in human bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, thymus, and fetal liver but not in non-lymphoid tissues. Cell binding studies with an Spα immunoglobulin (Spα-mIg) fusion protein indicated that Spα is capable of binding to peripheral monocytes but not to T or B cells. Spα-mIg was also found to bind to the monocyte precursor cell lines K-562 and weakly to THP-1 but not to U937. Spα-mIg also bound to the B cell line Raji and weakly to the T cell line HUT-78.

This family of proteins can be divided into two groups based upon the number of cysteine residues per SRCR domain, intron-exon organization, and domain organization (1Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Group B includes the cell surface proteins CD5 (2Jones N.H. Clabby M.L. Dialynas D.P. Huang H.-J.S.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 2320-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which is expressed by activated monocytes. Of these, only CD5 and CD6 have been studied extensively. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) cross-linking studies suggest that both CD5 and CD6 can function as accessory molecules capable of modulating T cell activation (7Gangemi R.M. Swack J.A. Gaviria D.M. Romain P.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2439-2447PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ledbetter J.A. Martin P.J. Spooner C.E. Wofsy D. Tsu T.T. Beatty P.G. Gladstone P. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2331-2336PubMed Google Scholar). The role of CD5 and CD6 in the regulation of T cell function is further supported by the finding that following T cell activation, Tyr residues in the cytoplasmic domain of these two proteins are transiently phosphorylated. This provides a molecular mechanism whereby the cytoplasmic domains of both CD5 and CD6 can interact with intracellular SH2 containing proteins involved in signal transduction (9Raab M. Yamamoto M. Rudd C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2862-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phenotypic analysis of a CD5-deficient murine strain showed that its T cells are hyper-responsive to stimulation (10Tarakhovsky A. Muller W. Rajewsky K. Eur. J.

CD5 and CD6 are structurally the most closely related members of the group B SRCR family of proteins (1Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). They are both type I membrane proteins whose extracellular region is composed of three SRCR-like domains, each containing eight cysteine residues that are thought to form intrachain disulfide bonds. The extracellular domains of CD5 and CD6 are anchored to the cell membrane via a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a long cytoplasmic domain. It has been reported that CD5 binds to the B cell antigen CD72 (12Van de Velde H. von Hoegen I. Luo W. Parnes J.R. Thielemans K. Nature. 1991; 351: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and to CD5L (13Biancone L. Bowen M. Aruffo A. Andres G. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), an antigen which is transiently expressed by activated B cells and has yet to be fully characterized. CD6 has been shown to bind to the leukocyte activation antigen ALCAM (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule). Unlike CD5 and CD6, which are closely related, CD72 and ALCAM are not homologous. CD72 is a type II membrane protein that is homologous to the C-type lectins; however, a carbohydrate binding activity for CD72 has not been reported. ALCAM is a type I membrane protein whose extracellular region is composed of five Ig-like domains (14Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Li X. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Neubauer M. Pesando J.M. Francke U. Haynes B.F. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The regions of CD5 and CD72 involved in their interaction have not been identified. Studies with truncated forms of both CD6 and ALCAM have shown that the interaction between these two proteins is primarily mediated by the membrane proximal SRCR domain of CD6 and the amino-terminal Ig-like domain of ALCAM (15Whitney G.S.

Here we report the cloning, chromosomal mapping, and cell binding properties of Spα, a novel member of the SRCR family of proteins. Spα is expressed in lymphoid tissues and has the same domain organization as the extracellular regions of both CD5 and CD6. Binding studies with an Spα Ig fusion protein were carried out to identify cells expressing a putative receptor for Spα. An expressed sequence tag (EST) data base screen for potential new SRCR domain-containing genes revealed a novel gene in EST clone number 201340. The partial (Spα) clone from a fetal liver-spleen was purchased from Research Genetics and used to screen a human spleen library (Clontech HL5011a) by plaque hybridization for full-length cDNAs. Approximately 1 × 106 clones were plated onto 20 150-mm plates and transferred to Hybond N- nylon membranes (Amersham Life Science, Inc., rpn132b) as per manufacturer instructions. Membranes were UV cross-linked and hybridized by the method of Church (17Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). The hybridization probe was a radiolabeled EcoRI fragment digested from the EST clone 201340. The EcoRI fragment contained base pairs 1-1594 and was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) using a random labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Membranes were washed at 60°C using high stringency wash buffer and exposed to Kodak x-ray film (X-Omat AR). A subset of positive plaques were then replated and rescreened. After three rounds of screening, ten individual clones were obtained, of which two were full-length. Both of these clones were sequenced in both directions using the dideoxy method. One cell line and two tissue Northern blots were purchased from Clontech (Nos. 7757-1, 7766-1, and 7754-1, respectively) and hybridized in 50% formamide at 42°C according to manufacturer instructions. Radiolabeled Northern blot probes were prepared as outlined above. mRNA normalization probes were either GAPDH or β-actin. Positive blots were washed under high stringency conditions. Blots were exposed to Kodak x-ray film (X-Omat AR). Human Spα was localized to a human chromosome using a panel of 17 human-Chinese hamster hybrid cell lines derived from several independent fusion experiments (18Francke U. Yang-Fang T.L. Brissenden J.E. Ullrich A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 855-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers used to amplify the human Spα gene sequence were derived from the 3′ untranslated region, and they are 5′-GAGTCTGAACACTGGGCTTATG (forward at nucleotide 1231-1252) and 5′-GTAATGGTCTGCACATCTGACC (reverse primer at nucleotide 1431-1452). The PCR conditions were 94°C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min followed by 72°C for 7 min. Two human radiation hybrid (RH) mapping panels, GeneBridge 4 (Whitehead/MIT Genome Center) and Stanford G3 (Stanford Human Genome Center), were used to confirm and further define the localization of the Spα gene. Typing was carried out using the primers and PCR conditions described above. 2The maximum likelihood analysis (19Walter M.A. Spillet D.J. Thomas P. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 20Boehnke M. Lange K. Cox D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 1174-1188PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cox D.R. Burmeister M. Price E.R. Kim S. Myers R.M.

The chromosomal location of the human Spα gene was independently determined by fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization (FISH) (22Li X. Yin X. Perez-Jurado L. Bonadio J. Francke U. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 42-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, a genomic DNA clone containing a 2.4-kbp insert of the human Spα genomic sequence in a TA cloning vector was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by nick-translation using commercial reagents (Boehringer Mannheim). Labeled probe was hybridized at a concentration of 300 ng/μl/slide to pretreated and denatured human lymphocyte metaphase chromosomes. Hybridizations were performed in the presence of salmon sperm DNA and human genomic DNA. After hybridization at 37°C overnight, the slides were washed in 50% formamide in 2 × SSC at 42°C. To detect and amplify specific hybridization signals, slides were reacted with avidin-FITC (Vector Laboratories), washed, and treated with biotinylated goat anti-avidin D antibody (Vector Laboratories) followed by another round of incubation with avidin-FITC. Metaphase chromosomes were analyzed under an Axiophot (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) epifluorescence microscope. Specific hybridization signals were counted only when the fluorescence staining was observed on both chromatids of a chromosome. Digital images were generated using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics PM512)/Macintosh computer system, with software supplied by Tim Rand (Yale University). Photographs were produced from PICT files. DNA corresponding to the translated region of Spα was obtained by PCR using full-length Spα cDNA as template. Primers were designed with restriction sites enabling Spα C-terminal ligation to the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of murine IgG2a (see Fig. 4). All constructs were sequenced to verify correct sequence and correct reading frames. Spα-mIg (in the CDM8 expression vector) was transiently expressed in COS cells (23Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The soluble Spα-mIg was purified from the COS cell supernatant by protein A column chromatography. Following protein A binding, the column was washed extensively with PBS (pH 7.0) and eluted with 4.0 M imidazole (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM each MgCl2 and CaCl2. Proteins were dialyzed extensively with PBS. Human cell lines were grown to 0.5-0.9 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human peripheral blood T, B, and monocytes cells were separated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were incubated on ice for 1 h in 100 μl of stain buffer (PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.05% sodium azide, 1 mM each MgCl2 and CaCl2) containing 20 μg/ml Spα-mIg fusion protein and 200 μg/ml human IgG (Sigma I-8640). Cells were then washed with stain buffer, centrifuged, and aspirated. Following a second wash, cells were then incubated on ice for 1 h in 100 μl of stain buffer containing 1:100 diluted FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG2a antibody (Zymed Laboratories, Inc. 61-0212). Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in 0.5 ml of stain buffer. Samples were run on a Becton Dickinson Facscan. Prior to running samples, propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Dead cells were identified as propidium iodide-positive and were gated out and not used in the analysis. Mouse antibodies specific for CD3 (64.1 generously donated by Jeff Ledbetter, Ph.D., T cell, Bristol-Myers Squibb), CD19 (B cell, IOB4a Amak 1313), and CD14 (monocytes, MY4 Coulter 6602622) were used to verify elutriated cells. Second step staining for these antibodies was an FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Biosource 4408). We have taken two approaches to isolating novel members of the SRCR family of proteins. The first involves a low stringency DNA hybridization technique, and the other involves a screening of the DNA data bases. This latter approach resulted in the identification of a cDNA fragment from the human EST data base that showed extensive sequence homology with members of the SRCR group B proteins, including CD5, CD6, M130, and WC1. The EST sequence (from fetal liver-spleen) was used as a probe to screen a cDNA library prepared from mRNA isolated from a human spleen. This resulted in the isolation of ten cDNA clones. The two longest clones, 1804 and 2152 bp, respectively, were sequenced in both orientations and found to contain a long open reading frame that encoded a 347-amino acid polypeptide, which had the features of a secreted protein (Fig. 1A). This protein was named Spα. Spα contains 19 hydrophobic amino acids at its amino-terminal that act as a secretory signal sequence and are removed from the mature protein as determined by N-terminal sequence of the Spα immunoglobulin fusion protein produced by COS cells. This secretory signal sequence is followed by three cysteine-rich domains, each approximately 100 amino acids in length. These domains are significantly homologous to the cysteine-rich domains found in the SRCR group B family of proteins (Fig. 1B) (1Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The third SRCR domain of Spα is followed by an in-frame stop codon. The predicted amino acid sequence of Spα contained no putative N-linked glycosylation sites. The two clones differ in the length of their 3′-untranslated regions, where one clone is 348 bp longer. The shorter clone has a poly(A) sequence starting 18 bases downstream from a consensus polyadenylation sequence. The longer clone has two polyadenylation consensus sequences; the first one is identical to the one found in the shorter clone, and the second is located 351 bp downstream from the first site. The longer clone also contains three adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-untranslated sequence located between the two polyadenylation sites. Amoung the SRCR group B members, the SRCR domain organization of Spα most closely resembles CD5 and CD6 (Fig. 1C). Genomic DNAs from a panel of 17 human-Chinese hamster hybrid cell lines were analyzed by PCR using primers that specifically amplified human Spα sequence. The expected 222-bp PCR products containing the 3′-untranslated region sequence were obtained from human control DNA and from hybrid cell lines that had retained human chromosome 1. As shown in Table I, except for chromosome 1, all other human chromosomes were excluded by this panel. These results indicated that the human Spα gene is located on chromosome 1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the Spα assignment to chromosome 1 and refined the physical map position. Based on the localization of the signal on R-banded chromosomes in 22 metaphase spreads, the human Spα gene was assigned to human chromosome bands q21-q23 (Fig. 2).Table IComparison of human SPα sequences with human-Chromosomes in human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybridsSPα signal/chromosomeHuman chromosome12345678910111213141516171819202122XDiscordant hybrids-/−02124140352230315204011−/-01432524315375421455532Concordant hybrids-/-53442406113436351452560−/−111067868681068347810766664Informative hybrids161615161616141615171617161517161717161716167Percent discordance019333138384325403544296333411935353153312543 Open table in a new tab To confirm this assignment and to map the Spα locus more precisely, two human RH mapping panels were typed by PCR amplification with the Spα specific primers. In the Stanford G3 mapping panel, 9 of 83 RH cell lines were positive for the human-specific Spα gene signal. By maximum likelihood analysis, Spα was placed 45.8 centiRays10000 (cR) from the STS marker D1S3249. In the GeneBridge 4 mapping panel, 30 of 93 RH cell lines were positive, and Spα was placed 3.0 cR3000 and 3.1 cR3000 from the chromosome 1 markers WI-8330 and CHLC.GATA43A04, respectively. The order of markers in this region from centromere to telomere is D1S305-WI-8330-Spα-CHLC.GATA43A04-D1S2635. D1S305, WI-8330, CHLC. GATA43A04, and D1S2635 are known markers in the WC1.17 contig (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research), while D1S3249 and D1S2635 are clustered as chromosome 1 bin 69 in the Stanford Human Genome Center RH map. A more distal marker D1S196, which is in Stanford Human Genome Center chromosome 1 bin 75 and WC1.17 contig, was previously mapped to the q22-q23 region (24Bray-Ward P. Menninger J. Lieman J. Desai T. Mokady N. Banks A. Ward C. Genomics. 1996; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our FISH mapping data that placed Spα at q21-q23. The insertion of Spα into the linkage map will enable the evaluation of this locus as a candidate for genetic disorders. RNA blot analysis using a Spα cDNA fragment as a probe indicated that mRNA encoding Spα is expressed in the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, and fetal liver but not in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) nor appendix (Fig. 3). Hybridizing bands to Spα were also not detected in prostate, testis, uterus, small intestine, and colon (separate blot, data not shown). In all cases, tissues expressing mRNA transcripts encoding Spα expressed three hybridizing transcripts. Three bands in the spleen (Fig. 3) are seen with shorter film exposure. These transcripts are ∼2.4, 2.1, and 1.8 kbp in length. The 1.8- and 2.1-kbp transcripts correspond in length to the two longest cDNAs isolated from the spleen cDNA library. Presently there is no information as to the nature of these transcripts; however, the finding that two of the cDNAs which we isolated have sizes that are consistent with those seen on the RNA blot suggest that they may all encode Spα but differ from one another in the length of their untranslated regions. It should be noted that we cannot exclude the possibility that one or more of these transcripts may encode closely related proteins. In an effort to determine which cells might produce Spα, we have analyzed several cell lines by Northern blot. The RNA message for Spα was not detected in the following cell lines: HL60, K562, Raji, Molt4, A549, SW480, GA361, HeLa S3, and peripheral blood leukocytes (data not shown). Previously, we had successfully used an Ig fusion approach to identify cells expressing a CD6 ligand (25Wee S.F. Wang W.-C. Farr A.G. Nelson A.J. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Linsley P.S. Aruffo A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 158: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies eventually led to the isolation of a cDNA encoding a CD6 ligand named ALCAM (14Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Li X. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Neubauer M. Pesando J.M. Francke U. Haynes B.F. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The successful application of this technique in the isolation of a CD6 ligand and the characterization of the CD6-ALCAM interaction led us to use the same approach to identify cells that express Spα receptors. We prepared a full-length Spα murine IgG2a (Spα-mIg) fusion protein by transient expression in COS cells (Fig. 4). We began a systematic examination of the ability of Spα-mIg to bind to human cell lines using flow cytometry. We observed that the myeloid cell line K-562 bound to Spα-mIg but not to a control protein (WC1-mIg) containing the amino-terminal three SRCR domains of bovine WC1 fused to the same constant domain of murine IgG2a (Fig. 5A, panel A). Binding of Spα to the K-562 cells was concentration-dependent and saturable (Fig. 5B). Spα-mIg also displayed weaker binding to the myeloid cell line THP1 (Fig. 5A, panel B) but not to U-937 cells (Fig. 5A, panel C). Binding of Spα-mIg was also observed on the lymphoma B cell line Raji (Fig. 6, panel A) and also the T cell line Hut78 (Fig. 6, panel C). Binding was not seen with the control protein on these two cell lines (Fig. 6, panel B and D).Fig. 6Flow cytometry of Spα immunoglobulin fusion construct binding to lymphoma cell lines.

As shown in Fig. 7, Spα-mIg (panels A and D), but not WC1-mIg (panels B and E), bound to peripheral blood monocytes. Binding of Spα-mIg was not seen on elutriated peripheral blood T cells (Fig. 8, panels A and D) nor on elutriated B cells (data not shown). The binding of Spα-mIg to elutriated monocytes from different donors could always be detected but showed some degree of variability (Fig. 7, panels A and D).Fig. 8Flow cytometry of Spα immunoglobulin fusion construct binding to elutriated T cells obtained from two donors.

A large body of in vitro data suggests that these proteins play an important role in regulating T cell activation and, in the case of CD6, T cell development. The isolation and functional characterization of novel proteins that are closely related to CD5 and CD6 might provide further insights on the function and structure of this class of proteins. We screened the human EST data base for cDNA fragments that encoded polypeptides, which were homologous to CD5 and CD6, and identified a cDNA fragment encoding Spα. Analysis of full-length cDNA clones encoding Spα suggests that Spα is a secreted protein that has the same domain organization as the extracellular region of CD5 and CD6. However, a detailed comparison of the amino acid sequence of SRCR domains of Spα with all members of the SRCR protein family revealed a closer homology to WC1 and M130. This suggests that Spα may be more closely related to WC1 than CD5 or CD6. Further evidence that points to a more distant evolutionary relationship between Spα and CD5 or CD6 than that between CD5 and CD6 comes from the finding that the genes encoding CD5 and CD6 are found in close proximity on chromosome 11 (26Tsuge I. Utsumi K.R. Ueda R. Takamoto S. Takahashi T. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1985; 11: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Bowen M.A. Whitney G.S. Neubauer M. Starling G.C. Palmer D.

Johnston M.K. Cannizzaro A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1989; 51Google Scholar), whereas the gene encoding Spα is located on chromosome 1. Presently there is no information of the genomic localization of the human equivalent of WC1 or M130. The subgroup of SRCR family members, which contains CD5, CD6, WC1 and M130 (Group B), can be distinguished from other members of the family based on the number of cysteine residues contained within the SRCR domains and the observation that the extracellular domains of each of these proteins are composed exclusively of SRCR domains. More recently, analysis of the genomic organization of the genes encoding some of the members of this subfamily has indicated that a third distinguishing feature of this group of proteins is that each of its SRCR domains is encoded by a separate exon (27Bowen M.A. Whitney G.S. Neubauer M. Starling G.C. Palmer D. Zhang J. Nowak N.J. Shows T.B. Aruffo A. J. Immunol. 1997; Google Scholar, 30Walker I.D. Glew M.D. O'Keefe M.A. Metcalfe S.A. Clevers H.C. Wijngaard P.L.

This is in contrast to the type I macrophage scavenger receptor and related proteins (Group A). The SRCR domains of group A proteins have fewer Cys residues (six instead of eight), and each SRCR domain is encoded by two exons. Preliminary data on the genomic organization of Spα indicates that the second SRCR domain is encoded by a single exon. 3J. A. Gebe, unpublished results. Based on these criteria, we propose that Spα be considered a member of the SRCR Group B family of proteins. RNA blot analysis indicates that transcripts encoding Spα are exclusively expressed in lymphoid tissues. However, it appears that leukocytes do not express this protein. This finding indicates that Spα may be produced by specialized epithelial and or endothelial cells in lymphoid tissues. The observation that Spα is expressed in bone marrow, thymus, and fetal liver, as well as in the spleen and lymph nodes, implicates this protein in processes responsible for both the development and maintenance of the lymphoid compartment. Studies are currently underway to identify the cells that make this protein and factors that are involved in regulating its expression. The Northern blot probed with Spα showed three bands. Based on our analysis of two different cDNAs encoding Spα, it appears that at least two of these transcripts correspond to mRNAs encoding Spα and differ in the length of their 3′-untranslated regions. We also observed a significant difference in the 3′-untranslated region of these Spα mRNAs. We found that the longer clone contained three consensus ARE elements (AUUUA). ARE elements are located within the 3′-untranslated region of mRNAs and have been found to be the most common determinant of RNA stability (32Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar, 33Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Messenger RNAs encoding cytokines and transcription factors, among others, contain these elements, which provide an additional mechanism for the regulation of protein expression by directing the stability and, therefore, half-life of the mRNA encoding the protein. The finding that at least one of the mRNAs encoding Spα contains ARE motifs suggests that the expression of this protein might be tightly regulated. Preliminary studies designed to identify cells that bind Spα and are the target of its activity revealed that some resting myeloid cell lines, as well as peripheral blood monocytes, are capable of binding Spα. Spα-mIg was also found to bind to the B cell line Raji and also the T cell line Hut78. These studies were carried out using an Spα immunoglobulin fusion protein, and thus, the possibility existed that the interaction between this protein and the myeloid cell lines and monocytes, which are known to express high levels of Fc receptors, was mediated via the Ig portion of the molecule rather than the Spα moiety. This is unlikely for the following reasons. 1) Two Ig fusion control proteins, WC1-mIg (SRCR Group B member) and human ALCAM-mIg, showed no binding; and 2) the interaction between the Spα-mIg and myeloid cell lines and peripheral blood monocytes was detected in the presence of a vast excess of human IgG (up to 2 mg/ml) present in the binding studies. The isolation of cDNAs encoding Spα, the preparation of Spα immunoglobulin fusion proteins, and the identification of cells that express putative receptors will provide the basis for future studies on the structure and function of this new member of the SRCR family of proteins. The finding that this protein is expressed in lymphoid organs involved in the development of the lymphoid compartment as well as in immune surveillance, in conjunction with the observation that peripheral blood monocytes are capable of binding Spα, suggests that this protein may play an important role in regulating the immune system.

We also thank Patty Davis (Bristol-Myers Squibb PRI) for providing us with some of the elutriated peripheral blood lymphocytes, Alison Wallace (Bristol-Myers Squibb PRI) for N-terminal sequencing of the Spα fusion protein, and the DNA sequencing department (Bristol-Myers Squibb Seattle) for help in sequencing the Spα clones."

Uptake of putrescine was inhibited by high concentrations of ornithine. This effect of ornithine appears to be due to putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity because it occurs only after accumulation of putrescine within cells and because ornithine causes excretion of putrescine.

Because Rho and ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) activate PC-PLD, we questioned whether these small G-proteins are regulated by insulin and PI 3-kinase. We found that insulin provoked a rapid translocation of both Rho and ARF to the plasma membrane and increased GTP loading of Rho. Wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited Rho translocation in intact adipocytes, and the polyphosphoinositide, PI 4,5-(PO4)2, stimulated Rho translocation in adipocyte homogenates. On the other hand, wortmannin did not block GTP loading of Rho. Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate stimulated both Rho and ARF translocation and activated PC-PLD in homogenates.

Aliquots were then treated with insulin, and Rho was quantitatively immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mM sucrose, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Precipitates were collected on protein AG-Sepharose beads, washed with lysis buffer and phosphate-buffered saline, and then heated for 20 min at 68°C in buffer containing 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mM GTP, and 0.5 mM GDP. GDP and GTP were separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) developed with 1 M KH2PO4 (pH 3.4). Plates were scanned and quantified in the Bio-Rad 32P Imaging System.PLD activation was measured both in situ in intact adipocytes and in vitro in post-nuclear homogenates of adipocytes after overnight labeling with[3H]oleic acid as described (1Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For in situ assays, cells were electroporated as described (16Cooper D.R. Watson J.E. Hernandez H. Yu B. Standaert M.L. Ways D.K. Arnold T. Ishizuka T. Farese R.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffer with or without 1 μg/ml Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (List), a selective inhibitor of Rho (17Aktories K. Just I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After overnight labeling (with or without C3 transferase), cells were equilibrated in KRP buffer containing 1% BSA and 2% ethanol and treated for 0-20 min with 10 nM insulin (see Ref. 1Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For in vitro assays, labeled cells were sonicated in Buffer I containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, and 3 mM NaCl. After equilibration of homogenates for 20 min at room temperature to release GDP, 1 μM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5% ethanol, and GTPγS were added, and incubation at 37°C was continued for 30 min. [32H]Phosphatidylethanol was isolated by TLC as described (1Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Glucose transport was assessed by measurement of [3H]2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake during a 1-min period, following treatment of adipocytes with vehicle (controls) or 10 nM insulin for 30 min as described (1Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were electroporated in the absence or the presence of C3 transferase and incubated for designated times prior to assessment of basal and insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake.DISCUSSIONThe present findings suggested that Rho and ARF may participate in the activation of PC-PLD by insulin in rat adipocytes. Both Rho and ARF translocated to plasma membranes sufficiently rapidly to contribute to the rapid activation of plasma membrane PC-PLD by insulin (see Ref. 1Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and both G-proteins have been reported to activate PC-PLD (10Brown H.A. Gutowski S.

In addition, GTPγS stimulated Rho and ARF translocation to the plasma membrane, as well as PLD activity, in adipocyte homogenates, and insulin increased GTP loading of Rho in intact cells. Moreover, insulin effects on PLD were inhibited by C3 transferase, which markedly depleted Rho.The present findings also suggested that PI 3-kinase activation, perhaps via polyphosphoinositides, may contribute to Rho translocation. Accordingly, both wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited the translocation of Rho in intact adipocytes, and PIP2 stimulated Rho translocation in vitro In addition, polyphosphoinositides may be required for PC-PLD activation (10Brown H.A.

Avignon A. Yamada K. Bandyopadhyay G. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and f-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated human neutrophils (20Reinhold S.L. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase leads to production of polyphosphoinositides in the plasma membrane, followed by translocation of Rho, GTP loading, and PLD activation. Along these lines, PIP2 increases GDP dissociation from ARF (11Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cdc42Hs and Rho (see Ref. 22Zheng Y. Glaven J.A. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23815-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, this dissociation does not necessarily result in GTP loading (22Zheng Y. Glaven J.A. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23815-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and, as shown presently, GTP loading of Rho appeared to be due to a factor distinct from PI 3-kinase.Recently, there has been keen interest in mechanisms whereby small G-proteins activate PC-PLD on the one hand and, on the other hand, regulate vesicle formation and trafficking and in a variety of cytoskeletal events. Of Rho family members (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42Hs subtypes), Rho A is important in PC-PLD activation (10Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Kahan R.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar). Rho has also been suggested to operate upstream of PI 3-kinase in human platelets (24Zhang J. King W.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in insulin-stimulated adipocytes, PI 3-kinase appears to be primarily activated by IRS-1 or other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (6White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1 is important in membrane ruffling (23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar) and seems to operate downstream of PI 3-kinase in insulin-induced membrane ruffling (26Kotani K. Hara K. Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rac1 and Cdc42Hs (but not Rho A) activate a 62-65-kDa protein kinase that regulates stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (27Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J.

GTPγS-containing forms of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 also bind to and activate PI 3-kinase, and although this suggested that PI 3-kinase may be a downstream effector, it was surmised from other evidence that PI 3-kinase operates upstream of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 (31Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Of further interest, PI 3-kinase and PC-PLD may control vesicle formation through the generation of membrane curvature-perturbing, acidic phospholipids, i.e. PI 3,4,5-(PO4)3, PI 3,4-(PO4)2, and PI 3-PO4, via PI 3-kinase action and phosphatidic acid via PLD action (32Liscovitch M. Cantely L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Also, conventional (α, β, and γ) and novel (Δ, ε, η, and θ) PKCs may be activated by diacylglycerol derived through PC-PLD action, and these PKCs, along with atypical PKCs (ζ and λ) and protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK1 or PKN; see below), may be activated by D3-PO4 polyphosphoinositides (33Nakanishi H.

Although not a member of the Rho family, ARF, like Rho, activates PC-PLD (10Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Kahan R.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and, as suggested by the finding that polyphosphoinositides stimulate GTP/GDP exchange in ARF (11Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PI 3-kinase may function upstream of ARF, as well as Rho. Obviously, both Rho and ARF may operate through or in conjunction with a variety of lipid and protein kinases and other signaling factors in regulating vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal events.Similar to our present observation of Rho and ARF translocation, f-Met-Leu-Phe stimulates ARF and Rho translocation in HL-60 cells (35Houle M.G. Kahn R.A. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22795-22800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and guanosine nucleotide exchange in Rho in lymphocytes (36Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, ARF and Rho may function in parallel or in tandem and co-ordinately activate PC-PLD and other processes in response to agonist treatment in various cell types.In addition to PLD activation, our observation that insulin-induced Rho translocation is sensitive to polyphosphoinositides and PI 3-kinase inhibitors is of interest, because: (a) GTP-Rho binds to an activation site in the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of a 120-kDa protein kinase, variously called PKN (21Amano M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), may activate PKN (PRK1), both directly via polyphosphoinositides and indirectly through Rho. The co-activation of Rho and PKN (PRK1) by polyphosphoinositides may facilitate their co-localization and may also co-ordinate the activation of PKN (PRK1) with other PKCs that are activated by PI 3-kinase through its lipid products or PC-PLD. With respect to PKC, it should be noted that we have not observed significant activation of PC-PLD or translocation of Rho during phorbol ester treatment in rat adipocytes.Finally, it was of interest to find that insulin-stimulated glucose transport was inhibited in cells depleted of Rho by C3 transferase treatment. This apparent requirement for Rho, coupled with the fact that Rho is translocated and activated by insulin, suggests that Rho may have a role in insulin stimulation of glucose transport. Clearly, more studies are needed to test this possibility and further define the role of Rho.In summary, insulin provoked rapid increases in Rho and ARF translocation to the plasma membrane and GTP loading of Rho in rat adipocytes. In addition, wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited insulin effects on Rho translocation in intact adipocytes, but wortmannin did not inhibit GTP loading of Rho. Of further note, PIP2 and GTPγS stimulated Rho translocation in adipocyte homogenates, and C3 transferase inhibited PLD activation in intact adipocytes. Collectively, these findings suggest that insulin translocates Rho by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism but stimulates GTP loading of Rho by a PI 3-kinase-independent mechanism, and both Rho and ARF may participate in the activation of PLD. Further studies will be required to define: (a) the precise mechanisms for activation and translocation of Rho and ARF and (b) the interrelated roles of PI 3-kinase and these small G-proteins in the activation of PC-PLD, various lipid-regulated protein kinases, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal events, and other cellular processes.

In this study, we show that interaction of n-alkanols and general anesthetics with PKCα results in dramatically different effects on membrane-associated compared with lipid-independent enzyme activity. Furthermore, the effects on membrane-associated PKCα differ markedly depending on whether activity is induced by diacylglycerol or phorbol ester and also on n-alkanol chain length. PKCα contains two distinct phorbol ester binding regions of low and high affinity for the activator, respectively (Slater, S. J., Ho, C., Kelly, M. B., Larkin, J. D., Taddeo, F. J., Yeager, M. D., and Stubbs, C. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 4627-4631). Short chain n-alkanols competed for low affinity phorbol ester binding to the enzyme, resulting in reduced enzyme activity, whereas high affinity phorbol ester binding was unaffected. Long chain n-alkanols not only competed for low affinity phorbol ester binding but also enhanced high affinity phorbol ester binding. Furthermore, long chain n-alkanols enhanced phorbol ester induced PKCα activity. This effect of long chain n-alkanols was similar to that of diacylglycerol, although the n-alkanols alone were weak activators of the enzyme. The cellular effects of n-alkanols and general anesthetics on PKC-mediated processes will therefore depend in a complex manner on the locality of the enzyme (e.g. cytoskeletal or membrane-associated) and activator type, apart from any isoform-specific differences.

https://openalex.org/W2026958232,"A significant proportion of the bacterially synthesized folate in the large intestine exists in the form of folate monoglutamate. Recent studies in our laboratory using human colonic apical membrane vesicles have shown the existence of an efficient carrier-mediated system for folate uptake. Nothing, however, is known about the cellular regulation of the colonic uptake process. In this study, we used a recently established human normal colonic epithelial cell line NCM460 to address this issue. Uptake of folic acid by NCM460 cells was: 1) linear with time for 4 min of incubation and occurred with minimal metabolic alterations, 2) temperature- and pH- (but not Na+) dependent, 3) saturable as a function of concentration (apparent Km of 1.4 μM), 4) inhibited by structural analogs and anion transport inhibitors, and 5) energy-dependent. These characteristics of folic acid uptake by NCM460 cells are similar to those seen with apical membrane vesicles derived from human native colonic tissue. Using these cells, we found that protein kinase C- and Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated pathways have no role in regulating folic acid uptake. On the other hand, cAMP (through a mechanism independent of protein kinase A) and protein-tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways were found to play a role in the regulation of folic acid uptake by these cells. These results establish the suitability of NCM460 cells as an in vitro model system for investigating the details of the mechanism of colonic folate uptake and its regulation. Folic acid uptake by these cells appears to involve a carrier-mediated system, which is temperature-, pH-, and energy-dependent and appears to be under the regulation of cAMP and protein tyrosine kinase. A significant proportion of the bacterially synthesized folate in the large intestine exists in the form of folate monoglutamate. Recent studies in our laboratory using human colonic apical membrane vesicles have shown the existence of an efficient carrier-mediated system for folate uptake. Nothing, however, is known about the cellular regulation of the colonic uptake process. In this study, we used a recently established human normal colonic epithelial cell line NCM460 to address this issue. Uptake of folic acid by NCM460 cells was: 1) linear with time for 4 min of incubation and occurred with minimal metabolic alterations, 2) temperature- and pH- (but not Na+) dependent, 3) saturable as a function of concentration (apparent Km of 1.4 μM), 4) inhibited by structural analogs and anion transport inhibitors, and 5) energy-dependent. These characteristics of folic acid uptake by NCM460 cells are similar to those seen with apical membrane vesicles derived from human native colonic tissue. Using these cells, we found that protein kinase C- and Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated pathways have no role in regulating folic acid uptake. On the other hand, cAMP (through a mechanism independent of protein kinase A) and protein-tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways were found to play a role in the regulation of folic acid uptake by these cells. These results establish the suitability of NCM460 cells as an in vitro model system for investigating the details of the mechanism of colonic folate uptake and its regulation. Folic acid uptake by these cells appears to involve a carrier-mediated system, which is temperature-, pH-, and energy-dependent and appears to be under the regulation of cAMP and protein tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2066300584,"Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) belongs to the group of lysosomal storage diseases characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol and sphingomyelin. Using a mutant mouse strain, enzymatic markers for lysosomes, mitochondria, microsomes, and peroxisomes were investigated in the liver and brain. Aside from lysosomal changes, we found a sizable decrease of peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids and catalase activity in the brain and liver. Isolated peroxisomes displayed a significant decrease of these enzyme activities. Furthermore, the only phospholipid change in brain was a decreased content of the plasmalogen form of phosphatidylethanolamine, and the dimethylacetal pattern was also modified. The electron microscopical appearance of peroxisomes did not display any large changes. The defect of peroxisomal enzymes was already present 18 days before the onset of the disease. In contrast, the lysosomal marker enzyme increased in activity only 6 days after appearance of the symptoms. The events of the studied process have previously been considered to be elicited by a lysosomal deficiency, but this study demonstrates disturbances similar to those in a number of peroxisomal diseases. It appears that the peroxisomal impairment is an early event in the process and could be a factor in the development of Niemann-Pick type C disease.

It appears that the peroxisomal impairment is an early event in the process and could be a factor in the development of Niemann-Pick type C disease. Niemann-Pick type C disease is characterized by the accumulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the lysosomes of several organs (1Vanier M.T. Pentchev P.G. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Rousson R. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1991; 14: 580-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The genetic defect responsible for this disease is not yet known, but the gene has been localized to chromosome 18 (2Carstea E.D. Polymeropoulus M.H. Parker C.C. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. O'Neill R.R. Patterson M.C. Goldin E. Xiao H. Strauss R.E. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The accumulation of sphingomyelin is considered to be an event secondary to the malfunction of cholesterol transport from the lysosomes to the cytoplasm. Experiments on human fibroblasts from these patients have demonstrated that the endocytosed low density lipoprotein cholesterol is not discharged from the lysosomes and therefore attenuated down-regulation of the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, occurs (3Pentchev G.G. Brady R.O. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Vanier M.T. Carstea E.D. Parker C.C. Goldin E. Roff C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Using a mutant mouse model of this disease, it was found that other mevalonate pathway lipids are also affected (4Schedin S. Pentchev P.G. Brunk U. Dallner G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The concentration of dolichyl phosphate is greatly increased in all organs, and the dolichol transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes is inhibited. There is also a relative increase of the higher isoprene number species of both the dolichol and dolichyl phosphate fractions. Not only are the contents of the mevalonate pathway lipids and sphingomyelin modified in the disease, several other lipids are also changed, particularly in the liver. Bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate, glycosylceramide, and sphingoid bases are reported to be elevated (5Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Vale D.D.

A severalfold increase of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide and an increase of GM2 1The abbreviations used are:GM2ceramixsde-glucose-galactose-(N-acetylneuraminic acid)-N-acetylgalactosamineGM3ceramide-glucose-galactose-N-acetylneuraminic acidNPCNiemann-Pick type CFAfatty acidPEphosphatidylethanolamineDMAdimethyl acetalFAMEfatty acyl methyl esterHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPPARperoxisome proliferator activated receptor. and GM3 gangliosides have been found. In the liver of mutant mice the amount of sterol carrier protein 2, a protein suggested to be involved in cholesterol transport and biosynthesis, is decreased by 80% (8Roff C.F. Pastuszyn A. Strauss III, J.F. Billheimer J.T. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Scallen T.J. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15902-15908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the various lipid accumulations have been associated with lysosomes, and the levels of several lysosomal enzymes were found to be altered (9Pentchev P.G. Gal A.E. Booth A.D. Omodeo-Sale F.

The extensive modifications in cholesterol and dolichol metabolism and transport raise several questions concerning the biochemical etiology of this disease. These two lipids are synthesized not only in microsomes but also in peroxisomes and are subjected to independent regulations (10Grünler J. Ericsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 259-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11Ericsson J. Appelkvist E.-L. Thelin A. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol.

In this study, we have therefore investigated the possibility that peroxisomes are also modified in Niemann-Pick type C disease, which is generally considered to be elicited by an enhanced lysosomal storage of lipids. The analyses led to the novel finding that in this condition, in contrast to the lysosomal disorders, a deficiency of peroxisomal function is an early event. In all experiments, a mutant BALB/c mouse model of NPC was used. The parental strain, from which the mutant mice were derived, served as a control. The controls were age-matched to the diseased mice. Since NPC is an autosomal recessively inherited disease, only 25% of the mice develop pathological symptoms. The most prominent symptom is ataxia, which appears around 48-50 days of age. The mice showing ataxia were selected for investigation within 3 days. After decapitation, tissues were quickly removed and homogenized in 0.25 M cold sucrose (1 g/10 ml) with an ultraturrax blender at 20,000 rpm for 1 min, which effectively disrupts all tissues. This homogenate was centrifuged at 310 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 2800 × g for 15 min to obtain the heavy mitochondrial/lysosomal fraction (13Runquist M. Ericsson J. Thelin A. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 25,300 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was called the light mitochondrial/lysosomal fraction. The supernatant above the latter pellet was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the microsomal fraction. Mouse liver peroxisomes were isolated on a Nycodenz gradient as described previously (14Appelkvist E.L. Reinhart M. Fischer R. Billheimer J. Dallner G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase activity was determined using lauroyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, or arachidonyl-CoA as substrates. The H2O2 produced was quantified fluorometrically by following the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid into 6,6′-dihydroxy-(1,1′-biphenyl)-3,3′-diacetic acid (15Poosch M.S. Yamazaki R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was monitored by following the reduction of NAD spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. KCN was used to inhibit mitochondrial β-oxidation (16Lazarow P.B. DeDuve C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 78: 2043-2046Crossref Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Catalase activity in the liver was measured spectrophotometrically at 240 nm by following the disappearance of H2O2 (17Bergmeyer H.U. Biochim. Z. 1955; 327: 255-258PubMed Google Scholar). Another catalase assay with higher sensitivity was used for brain samples. After incubation, the remaining H2O2 was quantified by adding titanium oxide sulfate, and the yellow peroxytitanium sulfate complex was measured at 405 nm (18Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. DeDuve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Urate oxidase was measured by following the oxidation of urate as a decrease in absorbance at 292 nm (18Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. DeDuve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Cytochrome oxidase and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase were determined as described earlier (18Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. DeDuve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 19Sottacosa G.L. Kuylenstierna G. Ernster L. Bergenstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Acid phosphatase was measured spectrophotometrically at 400 nm, by determining the Na-K-tartrate-inhibited cleavage of p-nitrophenyl phosphate into p-nitrophenol (20Ganoza, M. C., (1964) The Role of Lipid in Glucose-6-phosphatase Ph.D. thesis, Duke University, University Microfilms, Inc., Ann Arbor, MIGoogle Scholar). The protein content was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Chloroform/methanol/water in a ratio of 1:1:0.3 (v/v) was used for the extraction of lipids from tissue homogenates. The pelleted residue was re-extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the two supernatants were pooled and the non-lipid residue was used for DNA quantification according to Burton (22Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10853) Google Scholar). The lipid extract was placed onto a Silica-SepPak cartridge, and the neutral lipids were eluted with chloroform and phospholipids with methanol. All major phospholipid classes were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (23Dugan L.L. Demediuk P. Pendley II, C.E. Horrocks L.A. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 378: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The phospholipid fraction was dissolved in hexane/2-propanol (3:2, v/v) and injected onto a Zorbax SIL (25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5-6 μm) column maintained at 34°C. Solvent A was hexane/2-propanol (3:2, v/v), and solvent B was hexane/2-propanol/water (56.7:37.8:5.5, v/v). The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluant was monitored at 205 nm. The different phospholipid classes were collected and quantified by measuring lipid phosphorus as described previously (24Valtersson C. Dallner G. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 868-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diacyl, alkenylacyl, and alkylacyl subclasses of PE were separated by HPLC after their conversion to 1,2-diradylglycerol derivatives, as described previously (25Nakagawa Y. Horrocks L.A. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polar head group was removed with phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus, Sigma), and the 1,2-diradylglycerol mixture obtained was acetylated with pyridine and acetic anhydride. Separation of the acetyl diradylglycerol subclasses was achieved on a Zorbax SIL (25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5-6 μm) column by an isocratic system consisting of cyclopentane/hexane/t-butylmethyl ether/acetic acid (73:24:2:0.01, v/v). The column was maintained at 36°C, and the flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. The quantities of alkenylacyl, alkylacyl, and diacyl subclasses were determined by gas chromatography of the fatty acid methyl esters, using heptadecanoic acid as an internal standard. Lipids were methylated in 14% boron trifluoride in methanol (26Morrison W.R. Smith L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 600-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the resultant fatty acyl methyl esters and dimethyl acetals were extracted with n-pentane/5 M NaOH (4:1, v/v). The upper pentane phase was analyzed by GC on a Shimadzu GC-9A (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector. Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas, and the column was a fused silica capillary with a 0.18-μm cyanosiloxane 60 film as the stationary phase (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter). The temperature was programmed from 130°C to 190°C, and total time per run was 45 min. Fatty acyl methyl esters and dimethyl acetals were identified by comparison of their retention times with known standards. Quantification was achieved by integrating the peaks on a Shimadzu Chromatopac C-R3A. For electron microscopy, peroxisomes were stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (27Angermüller S. Fahimi H.D. Histochemistry. 1981; 71: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The samples were fixed in a mixture containing 3% glutaraldehyde, 0.2 M sodium cacodylate chloride, and 0.25 M sucrose (pH 7.2) at 4°C overnight. Postfixation was performed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate chloride, pH 7.2, for 90 min at 20°C. The fixed samples were dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Several enzyme activities, known to be associated with specific organelles, were analyzed in the liver homogenates of mice exhibiting clinical signs of NPC disease, i.e. in the initial phase, around 48-50 days of life. The specific activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, an enzyme present only in the endoplasmic reticulum, was identical in diseased mice and the age-matched controls (Table I). The activity of cytochrome oxidase, a component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, was also unaltered. On the other hand, three enzymes associated with peroxisomes exhibited reduced activity in comparison with the controls. There was a moderate decrease of urate oxidase and catalase activities (20-30%), and the β-oxidation enzyme, lauroyl-CoA oxidase, activity was decreased by 50%.Table I.Enzyme activities in liver homogenateEnzymeLiverControlNPCNADPH-cytochrome c reductaseanmol cytochrome c reduced/(min × mg protein).3.31 ± 0.413.37 ± 0.33Cytochrome oxidasebμmol cytochrome c oxidized/(min × mg protein).0.133 ± 0.0150.154 ± 0.016Urate oxidasecμmol urate/(min × mg protein).0.070 ± 0.0050.057 ± 0.006*Catalasedmmol H2O2/(min × mg protein).0.406 ± 0.0550.297 ± 0.028*Lauroyl-CoA oxidaseenmol/(min × mg protein).0.891 ± 0.1200.437 ± 0.028***a nmol cytochrome c reduced/(min × mg protein).b μmol cytochrome c oxidized/(min × mg protein).c μmol urate/(min × mg protein).d mmol H2O2/(min × mg protein).e nmol/(min × mg protein). Open table in a new tab Differential centrifugation was performed to obtain a heavy mitochondrial/lysosomal fraction and a light mitochondrial/lysosomal fraction, as well as microsomes. The mitochondrial fractions contained the peroxisomes. The peroxisomes present in the two fractions exhibited different properties (Table II). The specific activities of both catalase and lauroyl-CoA oxidase were greatly decreased in the heavy mitochondrial fraction of the diseased mice, while the decrease was quite limited in the light mitochondrial fraction. The specific activity of acid phosphatase was doubled in the two mitochondrial fractions from diseased mice, which is in agreement with the finding that lysosomes are affected in NPC disease. There was also a 3-fold increase of acid phosphatase activity in the microsomes, which may be explained by the slow sedimentation of a fraction of lipid-filled lysosomal vesicles remaining in the microsomal fraction. Both cytochrome oxidase and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity remained constant when compared to control mice, indicating that neither the mitochondria nor the endoplasmic reticulum are affected by the disease.Table II.Enzyme activities in subfractions of the liverEnzymeHeavy mit/lysosomesLight mit/lysosomesMicrosomesCatalaseammol H2O2/(min × mg protein).Control0.630 ± 0.0390.228 ± 0.025NDNPC0.328 ± 0.041*0.204 ± 0.030NDLauroyl-CoA oxidasebnmol/(min × mg protein).Control9.47 ± 0.355.65 ± 0.220.13 ± 0.020NPC6.71 ± 0.17***5.12 ± 0.450.16 ± 0.033Acid phosphatasecnmol Pi/(min × mg protein).Control31.6 ± 3.828.1 ± 4.27.77 ± 1.9NPC55.9 ± 7.4***59.7 ± 4.1***22.8 ± 3.2***Cytochrome oxidasedμmol cytochrome c oxidized/(min × mg protein).Control1.10 ± 0.180.22 ± 0.0210.05 ± 0.0016NPC0.99 ± 0.0990.25 ± 0.0330.05 ± 0.0050NADPH-cytochrome c reductaseenmol cytochrome c reduced/(min × mg protein).Control7.59 ± 0.996.91 ± 0.5524.7 ± 2.3NPC5.02 ± 1.05*7.38 ± 1.124.7 ± 1.9a mmol H2O2/(min × mg protein).b nmol/(min × mg protein).c nmol Pi/(min × mg protein).d μmol cytochrome c oxidized/(min × mg protein).e nmol cytochrome c reduced/(min × mg protein).

Using this procedure, the fraction obtained has a very low cross-contamination with other organelles but the recovery is low and prevents extensive investigation.

Open table in a new tab The peroxisomal β-oxidation of FA in the liver homogenates was determined by measuring H2O2 production in the presence of various FA-CoA species (Fig. 1). The acyl-CoA oxidase activity measured with octanoyl-, lauroyl-, myristoyl-, palmitoyl-, and arachidonyl-CoA as substrates was decreased by half or more as compared to the control, indicating a generalized impairment of peroxisomal β-oxidation. Symptoms of the disease become apparent around 48 days of age, and the mice die at around 70 days. The peroxisomal and lysosomal activities in the liver were followed during the time period after development of clinical symptoms. When the symptoms first appeared, palmitoyl-CoA oxidation and lauroyl-CoA oxidase as well as catalase and urate oxidase activities were greatly diminished, but activities gradually recovered and almost reached the level of control values by the end of the 3rd week (Fig. 2). In contrast, lysosomal acid phosphatase activity was about the same as the control during the first few days and reached maximal amplification 13 days later. The experiment above suggested that the peroxisomal enzyme activities may already be decreased before the onset of overt clinical symptoms. Groups of mice pooled into affected and nonaffected were selected for analysis of the liver (Table V). The average age of the mice was 31 days, 18 days before the symptoms are expected to appear. Mice exhibiting elevated levels of cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate were considered as homozygous for the NPC mutation. This group of animals exhibited a considerably decreased activity of peroxisomal β-oxidation, indicating that the peroxisomal deficiency is manifested long before the appearance of the disease symptoms.Table V.Properties of NPC mice livers 18 days before the onset of the diseaseControlNPCProtein contentag/g liver.0.159 ± 0.0200.142 ± 0.007Cholesterol contentbmg/g liver.2.79 ± 0.7211.7 ± 1.38***Dolichyl phosphate contentcμg/g liver.5.19 ± 1.4111.8 ± 2.00***Lauroyl-CoA oxidasednmol/(min × mg protein).0.823 ± 0.1410.472 ± 0.088**a g/g liver.b mg/g liver.c μg/g liver.d nmol/(min × mg protein). Open table in a new tab Hepatocytes contain morphologically well characterized peroxisomes with a rich proteinaceous content in the lumen. We have used a diaminobenzidine staining procedure, which detects peroxisomal catalase as a granular precipitation (data not shown). No obvious differences in appearance and distribution could be observed between control and NPC liver. Investigating a series of images from both control and diseased tissues, we could not see any great differences in the number or size of these organelles. The major phospholipid components of the mouse brain, PE and phosphatidylcholine, are present in about equal amounts (Fig. 3A). The brain is also relatively rich in phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin, while cardiolipin and phosphatidylinositol are smaller components. No clear-cut difference in total amount of phospholipid could be observed between control and NPC mouse brain. On the other hand, after phospholipid class separation there was a small decrease of PE content. PE consists of two main subclasses, the alkenylacyl and the diacyl forms (Fig. 4). The alkylacyl PE, the precursor of the alkenylacyl form, makes up only a few percent of the total. In the diseased brain, the amount of alkenylacyl PE was decreased by one third, while the levels of the two other forms were unchanged. Thus, the decrease of PE in NPC brain is solely caused by a decrease of PE plasmalogen. Some increase of sphingomyelin was also noticed, but this change was not statistically significant.Fig. 4Subclasses of PE in mouse brain. NPC mice were taken 4-6 days after the appearance of symptoms for preparation of brain homogenates. After isolation of PE, the lipid was hydrolyzed by phospholipase C and acetylated in the presence of pyridine. The alkenylacyl-, alkylacyl-, and diacyl forms were separated on a silica column by HPLC. Quantification was achieved by gas chromotography of the fatty acid methyl esters. The values are the means of separate experiments, using 4 individual mice from each group. The bars show S.D.; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In NPC liver, the total phospholipid level on DNA basis was increased from 12.89 ± 1.23 to 15.71 ± 1.05 mg of phospholipid/mg of DNA. This is explained by the severalfold elevation of the sphingomyelin content (Fig. 3B). The dominating phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, as well as cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine, all remained unchanged. The fatty acid patterns of total lipids in the brain and liver are very different (Table VI). Dimethyl acetals (DMAs) are the aldehyde associated with carbon 1 on the plasmalogens. They are present in the liver in only minute amounts because of the very low level of plasmalogens in this tissue and therefore were not determined. In both organs, the FA composition of total lipids remained completely unchanged in the diseased state. In the brain, DMAs are restricted to a few components, consisting of 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1. There were significant changes in DMA distribution in the case of NPC brain, apparent as an increase of the 16:0 and a decrease of the 18:1 species.Table VIFAME and DMA compositions of total lipids from mouse brain and liverBrainLiverNPCControlNPCControl% of totalFAME16:027.1724.7322.0722.0916:10.741.091.110.8418:020.0219.8014.3213.9018:117.5419.9113.7314.1918:21.170.7819.0619.7218:30.460.4720:11.192.050.240.3920:410.139.2517.2015.8522:42.633.141.090.5822:619.3417.159.5610.1424:00.590.931.010.5224:10.781.201.161.24DMA16:033.01**28.8318:042.6542.6618:124.33**28.53 Open table in a new tab Because of the observed modifications of the DMA pattern, we also analyzed the FA composition of PE subclasses (Table VII). The plasmalogen form was highly enriched in polyunsaturated FA, while the diacyl form was dominated by the 16:0 and 18:0 species. The FA composition of alkenylacyl and diacyl PE was very similar in both control and NPC mice. The DMA composition of the plasmalogen fraction of the PE was, as expected, similar to that found for the total lipids.

The murine model of the disease makes possible a detailed study of the enzyme modifications involved. Using this system, we have found impairments in peroxisomal activities, indicating the involvement of this organelle in the pathogenesis of this disorder. These observations reveal new aspects of the disease process, as they demonstrate that peroxisomal deficiencies occur long before the manifestation of the disease symptoms. There was a sizable decrease of all peroxisomal enzymes determined in the liver, i.e. β-oxidation of various types of fatty acids + catalase and urate oxidase. The impairment of β-oxidation and catalase was also expressed in the brain of these mice, indicating involvement of peroxisomal dysfunction in multiple organs. Furthermore, the only change in brain phospholipids was a 33% decrease of PE plasmalogens. The initial portion of plasmalogen synthesis, formation of the ether bond, takes place in peroxisomes (28van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), which explains why only plasmalogen and not other phospholipids are affected. The dimethyl acetal pattern of PE plasmalogens was also substantially modified, and, consequently, the decrease in PE plasmalogens is probably caused by an impaired peroxisomal synthesis rather than increased breakdown. Some peroxisomal diseases, such as Zellweger syndrome, are characterized by accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (29Lazarow P.B. Moser H.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1989: 1479-1509Google Scholar). In these cases, the peroxisomal β-oxidation is completely missing. In NPC mice, the β-oxidation is only partially deficient and no changes in the lipid-bound fatty acids could be observed. Thus, it appears that the residual β-oxidation capacity is sufficient enough, which, together with the relatively short life span of the diseased mice, prevents accumulation of very long chain fatty acids. Electron microscopical investigations did not reveal great changes in the structure and the number of peroxisomes in the diseased mice. This finding is not surprising since in many identified peroxisomal diseases where partial defects of enzyme systems have been observed, the peroxisomal morphology remained unchanged (30Goldfischer S.L. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1988: 255-267Google Scholar). This fact, however, does not exclude the possibility that structural modifications at the organelle level exist. In our experiments, the peroxisomes present in the heavy mitochondrial fraction displayed considerable enzyme deficiencies in contrast to those present in the light mitochondrial fraction. This suggest that a unique population of this organelle may be responsible for the anomalies found in the disease process. Isolated peroxisomes exhibit a 40-50% decrease of various peroxisomal enzyme activities, and it would be of considerable interest to perform subfractionation studies to investigate the possible heterogeneity in this fraction. Such a subfractionation study, however, has not yet been performed mainly because of the small number of peroxisomes in the liver and the extremely poor recovery afforded by the present methods employed. It has previously been found that in the NPC mouse liver, sterol carrier protein-2 exhibits an 80% decrease in the postnuclear fraction (8Roff C.F. Pastuszyn A. Strauss III, J.F. Billheimer J.T. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Scallen T.J. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15902-15908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is believed to be necessary in certain reactions, including the transformation of lanosterol to cholesterol (31Scallen T.J. Schuster M.W. Dhar A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 224-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the activation of the microsomal cis-prenyltransferase (32Ericsson J. Scallen T.J. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10602-10607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the transport of steroids (33Scallen T.J. Pastuszyn A. Noland B.J. Roland C. Kharroubi A. Vahouny G.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the liver, the major part of this protein is present in peroxisomes and the rest is a cytosolic component (34Ossendorp B.C. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochemie. 1993; 75: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The large decrease of the level of sterol carrier protein-2 in NPC lends further support to the participation of peroxisomes in the cellular pathogenic events of this disorder. NPC is associated with a genetic defect on chromosome 18. The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily has a member that is crucial for peroxisome biogenesis, known as the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, PPAR. PPAR consists of three isoforms, which are activated by distinct signaling pathways and regulated by various other nuclear hormone receptors (35Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 36Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar, 37Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that glucocorticoids can stimulate synthesis of PPARα mRNA and that this activation was mediated via the glucocorticoid receptor (38Lemberger T. Staels B. Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is plausible that the mutation on chromosome 18 could interfere with peroxisomal activation. The peroxisomal changes appear not only to be a part of an adaptation mechanism to the disease manifestation but already exist before the appearance of clinical symptoms. During the early phases of clinical presentation, when symptoms like ataxia first appear, peroxisomal enzyme activities are greatly decreased, while lysosomal enzyme markers appear less affected. Surprisingly, all peroxisomal enzyme activities begin to normalize during the late phase of the disease and begin to approach the control values. In contrast, the initially normal acid phosphatase increases continuously and is doubled 2 weeks after the appearance of the symptoms. These results demonstrate that peroxisomal modifications play a significant role in initial events and thereby are important in understanding the etiology of the NPC disease process."

These experiments investigated the influence of the cell cycle on C/EBP isoform expression in mammary epithelial cells (COMMA D) and fibroblasts (NIH3T3). C/EBP-δ gene expression is induced in COMMA D cells arrested in G0 by serum and growth factor withdrawal or contact inhibition. C/EBP-δ mRNA, nuclear protein content, and DNA binding activity increase during G0 growth arrest and decrease after cell cycle induction in COMMA D cells. Growth arrest is markedly delayed in COMMA D cells expressing a C/EBP-δ antisense construct. C/EBP-β is induced during G1 of the cell cycle. In contrast to COMMA D cells, C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ mRNA levels remain relatively constant in growth-arrested and cell cycle-induced NIH3T3 cells. However, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP10) mRNA levels markedly increase in growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells. Both COMMA D and NIH3T3 cells express growth arrest-specific (gas1) and JunD during G0.

The overall goal of this study was to investigate the influence of the cell cycle on C/EBP isoform expression in COMMA D mammary epithelial cells. The mammary gland differs from most tissues in that it attains full functional capacity relatively late in life, at sexual maturation (24Neville M. Daniel C. The Mammary Gland. Plenum Press, New York1989: 563-570Google Scholar, 25Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1989; 45: 383-440PubMed Google Scholar). In the adult female, the mammary gland retains the capacity to undergo hormone-induced proliferation, differentiation, and involution throughout the reproductive years (24Neville M. Daniel C. The Mammary Gland. Plenum Press, New York1989: 563-570Google Scholar, 25Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1989; 45: 383-440PubMed Google Scholar). The growth control mechanisms underlying this unique biology are poorly understood. Much of our current understanding of growth control and the mammalian cell cycle is derived from studies with fibroblast cell lines (26Almendral J.M. Sommer D. MacDonald-Bravo H. Burkhardt J. Perera J. Bravo R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells, however, utilize unique transcriptional control mechanisms (27Hennig G. Lowrick O. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 595-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and express some early growth response genes that differ from fibroblasts and lymphocytes (28Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J.-C. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Epithelial cell-specific differences in the expression of growth response genes may also extend to growth arrest response genes (29Kallin B. deMartin R. Etzold T. Sorrentino V. Philipson L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5336-5345Crossref Google Scholar). Epithelial cells are commonly implicated in human cancers (28Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J.-C. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell.

Understanding the growth arrest response in mammary epithelial cells is of particular significance as breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States (30Swanson G.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 848-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that growth arrest is associated with the expression of different C/EBP isoforms in mammary epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The specific induction of C/EBP-δ in growth-arrested COMMA D mammary epithelial cells and its disappearance during the cell cycle suggest a novel tissue-specific growth regulatory role for this C/EBP isoform in mammary epithelial cells. This regulatory role is supported by a delay in growth arrest of COMMA D cells expressing C/EBP-δ antisense. COMMA D, a nontransformed line of mammary epithelial cells (31Danielson K.G. Oborn C.J.

NIH3T3 cells (ATCC CRL 1658) were cultured in similar complete growth media without the addition of epidermal growth factor. Cell cycle experiments were carried out by incubating near-confluent cultures for 72 h in growth arrest media containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter D-glucose, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. After reintroducing complete media, cells were harvested at the designated times for RNA or protein analysis. Growth arrest experiments were carried out by switching near-confluent cultures from complete growth media to growth arrest media and harvesting at the designated times. To produce stable antisense cell lines COMMA D cells were transfected with a C/EBP-δ 400-base pair partial cDNA fragment (antisense orientation) and vector controls (pcDNA3, Invitrogen, Palo Alto, CA). Stable cell lines were drug-selected, and single cell clones were isolated and expanded as described (33DeWille J.W. Jenh C.-H. Deng T. Harendza C.J. Johnson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 84-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood TX). Northern blots were carried as described (34DeWille J.W. Farmer S.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1993; 1170: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with the following random primer labeled cDNAs: C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, C/EBP-δ, CHOP10, gas1 cDNA, and histone 2B (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). Cyclophilin receptor protein partial cDNA was used as a constitutive probe (34DeWille J.W. Farmer S.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1993; 1170: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results are representative of 2-4 experiments. Western blots were performed by standard procedures (35Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell J.R. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

McKnight S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)) was used to detect C/EBP-δ. Rabbit anti-C/EBP-β and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. A goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as a secondary antibody, and the signal was developed with the ECL system (Amersham). Nuclear pellets were isolated and EMSA were carried out essentially as described by Ray et al. (10Ray A. Hannink M. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7365-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBP consensus (5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′) and mutant binding sites (Santa Cruz, Palo Alto, CA) were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. For antibody interaction studies, appropriate dilutions of specific antisera to C/EBP-δ and control (preimmune) sera were added to the EMSA reactions. Cultures were synchronized in a growth-arrested (G0) state by serum and growth factor withdrawal for 72 h, and the cell cycle was initiated by the introduction of complete growth media. Growth arrest (G0) and synchronous cell cycle progression were verified by [3H]thymidine incorporation (data not shown). C/EBP-δ mRNA content was elevated in growth-arrested (G0) COMMA D cells after 72 h of serum and growth factor withdrawal (Fig. 1). C/EBP-δ mRNA content decreases rapidly (within 1 h of cell cycle induction), increases slightly during G1/early S phase (4-12 h after cell cycle induction), and then declines during the remainder of the cell cycle. In contrast, C/EBP-β mRNA content increases during early G1/S phase, then gradually declines to base-line levels. Growth arrest-specific 1 (gas1) mRNA, originally characterized in growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells (36Schneider C. King R.M. Phillipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 37Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), is highly induced in quiescent (G0) COMMA D cells, declines during G1, and then increases somewhat through S phase (36Schneider C. King R.M. Phillipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 37Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Histone 2B (H2B) mRNA content was minimal after 72 h of growth arrest, began to accumulate 8 h after cell cycle induction, peaked at 18-20 h, and then declined. Growth arrest (G0) and cell cycle progression had little effect on C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ mRNA levels in NIH3T3 cells. gas1 mRNA levels exhibited a growth-regulated biphasic pattern (high in G0, low in G1, moderate in S), similar to that observed in COMMA D cells and previous reports from NIH3T3 cells (36Schneider C. King R.M. Phillipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 37Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). H2B mRNA began to accumulate to significant levels in NIH3T3 cells 8-12 h after cell cycle induction, consistent with a synchronous cell cycle. To investigate the association between C/EBP-δ and the onset of growth arrest, time points were taken 1, 12, and 24 h after growth arrest induction by serum and growth factor withdrawal. In COMMA D cells, C/EBP-δ mRNA levels began to accumulate after 12 h and persisted after 24 h of growth arrest induction (Fig. 2). CHOP10 mRNA content decreased, and C/EBP-β and JunD mRNA levels increased slightly after 24 h of growth arrest induction. In NIH3T3 cells, C/EBP-δ and C/EBP-β mRNA levels remain relatively unchanged 24 h after growth arrest induction (Fig. 2). In contrast to COMMA D, CHOP10 mRNA content was markedly increased 24 h after growth arrest induction in NIH3T3 cells. JunD, a previously described negative growth regulator in NIH3T3 cells (38Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), increased slightly after 24 h of growth arrest in NIH3T3 cells. The growth arrest response initiated by serum and growth factor withdrawal may differ from density-dependent growth arrest, even though both induce a G0 state (39Gutincich S. Schneider C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of density-dependent growth arrest on C/EBP-δ expression, RNA was isolated from COMMA D cells after high density plating (day 0) and grown to confluence in complete media (days 1 and 2). H2B mRNA content decreased as COMMA D cells reached confluence (day 2) (Fig. 3A). C/EBP-δ mRNA content was low in growing and near-confluent cells (days 0 and 1). C/EBP-δ mRNA content increased in concert with the initiation of density-dependent growth arrest and the decline in H2B mRNA content (day 2). Day 2 COMMA D cultures were refed fresh growth media, and one synchronous round of the cell cycle was initiated as evidenced by an increase in H2B mRNA content and a decrease in C/EBP-δ mRNA content (day 3). This was followed by decreasing H2B mRNA and increasing C/EBP-δ mRNA levels (day 4 and 5) as COMMA D cells re-enter a density-dependent, growth-arrested state. Histone 2B mRNA content declined as NIH3T3 cells entered density-dependent growth arrest (Fig. 3B). C/EBP-δ mRNA content, however, remained relatively high in NIH3T3 cells regardless of cell density or growth status. C/EBP-δ mRNA was also induced in a second density-dependent growth-arrested mouse mammary epithelial cell line, NMuMG cells (data not shown). COMMA D C/EBP-δ protein content declines during the cell cycle. Nuclear C/EBP-δ protein levels are elevated in 72-h growth-arrested COMMA D cells, then decline as cells synchronously progress through the cell cycle (Fig. 4A). The identity and potential function of a second lower molecular weight band in the nuclear, but not the cytoplasmic, compartment is unknown. As COMMA D cultures synchronously progress through the cell cycle, the nuclear C/EBP-δ protein content declines, and the cytoplasmic C/EBP-δ content increases slightly. This suggests some degree of subcellular localization of C/EBP-δ in growing versus growth-arrested COMMA D cells. C/EBP-β protein content, which is predominately localized to the nucleus in COMMA D cells, increases slightly 6 and 12 h after cell cycle induction (data not shown). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen is detectable in the nucleus 12 h after cell cycle induction, consistent with normal cell cycle progression (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the cell cycle, C/EBP-δ nuclear protein content increases in growth-arrested COMMA D cells. Low levels of C/EBP-δ protein are detectable in the cytoplasm, but not the nucleus, of growing COMMA D cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2). C/EBP-δ nuclear protein content increases significantly after 48 h of growth arrest (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4). Increases in COMMA D C/EBP-δ nuclear protein content are detectable as early as 8 h after the withdrawal of serum and growth factors (data not shown). C/EBP-β protein, which is also primarily localized to the nucleus in COMMA D cells, was relatively unchanged after 2 days of growth arrest (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-4). Specific binding to a C/EBP consensus site increases in nuclear extracts from 2- and 4-day growth-arrested COMMA D cells compared to day 0 (growing) cells (Fig. 6A). No binding was detected to a C/EBP mutant site (Fig. 6A). Preincubation of COMMA D nuclear extracts with anti C/EBP-δ antisera, but not preimmune sera, decreased C/EBP binding activity (Fig. 6, B and C).Fig. 6EMSA analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of growing versus growth-arrested COMMA D cells. A, nuclear lysates (15 μg of protein) were incubated with a 5′-end-labeled C/EBP consensus or mutant binding site in buffer plus poly[d(I-C)]. B, nuclear lysates were incubated with C/EBP-δ antisera (60 min) prior to the EMSA reactions. C, nuclear lysates were incubated with preimmune sera (60 min) prior to the EMSA reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To more directly address the role of C/EBP-δ in COMMA D cells, stable cell lines expressing a C/EBP-δ antisense construct were produced. Growth arrest induces C/EBP-δ protein levels in control (vector-transfected) COMMA D cells, but not in the C/EBP-δ antisense expressing cell line, δ3 (Fig. 7A). The influence of the C/EBP-δ antisense expression on the growth arrest response of δ3 cells was assessed. C/EBP-δ antisense expression in δ3 cells significantly delays the δ3 growth arrest response compared with controls. [3H]thymidine incorporation (indicator of DNA replication) rapidly declines (within 12 h) in control cells after serum and growth factor withdrawal of near-confluent cultures (Fig. 7B). [3H]Thymidine incorporation continues to decline to near base-line levels after 48 h of growth arrest in control cells. In δ3 cells expressing C/EBP-δ antisense, [3H]thymidine incorporation remains elevated for 12-18 h, then begins to decline for the first 30 h of the growth arrest response. In addition, C/EBP-δ antisense expression in δ3 cells results in a slower decline in δ3 histone 2B mRNA content and a slower accumulation of δ3 gas1 mRNA over the first 30 h of the growth arrest response. The mammary gland exhibits a unique tissue-specific pattern of growth and development that is well-characterized at the hormonal level but poorly understood at the molecular level. These results implicate C/EBP-δ in the growth arrest response of COMMA D cells, a mouse mammary epithelial cell line. The results also demonstrate differences between the expression and potential function of C/EBP-δ in COMMA D cells compared with fibroblast-derived cells. Earlier reports with 3T3-L1 cells indicated that C/EBP-δ expression peaks during active cell division and decreases as 3T3-L1 cells withdraw from the cell cycle and terminally differentiate (40Vasseur-Cognet M. Lane M.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A relatively similar temporal pattern of C/EBP-δ expression occurs in differentiating myelomonocytic cells (19Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Roth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 7: 1725-1735Crossref Google Scholar). The tissue-specific functions of C/EBP-δ are also apparent in liver, where C/EBP-δ expression increases early in the proliferative response following partial hepatectomy and during the acute inflammatory response (9Flodby P. Antonson P. Barlow C. Blanck A. Porsch-Hallstrom I. Xanthopoulos K.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Ray A. Hannink M. Ray B.K. J. Biol.

Wilson D.R. Wilde M.D. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2584-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In response to inflammation, C/EBP-δ transactivates the human complement component 3 and serum amyloid A1 genes (10Ray A. Hannink M. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7365-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Juan T.S.-C. Wilson D.R. Wilde M.D. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2584-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results indicate that C/EBP-δ is expressed in a wide range of tissues, but its pattern of induction and potential role in cell function, particularly growth regulation, is highly tissue-specific. The association between C/EBP-δ and growth arrest in mammary epithelial cells may be specific to treatments that induce withdrawal from the cell cycle, or G0. For example, serum/growth factor withdrawal and contact inhibition both induce G0 and both induce C/EBP-δ. If C/EBP-δ is blocked by antisense RNA expression, G0 induction by serum and growth factor removal is markedly delayed. In addition, cell lines expressing C/EBP-δ antisense RNA grow to a higher cell density than the parental COMMA D cells and vector-transfected controls (data not shown). This suggests that the removal or inactivation of C/EBP-δ inhibits the initiation of G0 by contact inhibition. Finally, drugs that induce blocks within the cell cycle, such as hydroxyurea (G1/S block) or nocodazole (G2 block), do not induce C/EBP-δ (data not shown). Similar perturbations of the growth arrest response occur in hepatoma cells expressing C/EBP-α antisense RNA, indicating that C/EBP isoforms may function in the growth arrest response of a variety of tissues (42Ramos R. Nishio Y. Maiyar A. Simon K. Ridder C. Ge Y. Firestone G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that cells expressing antisense RNA to the known tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and Waf1 are also aberrant in G0 induction and maintenance (43Rao V. Shao N. Ahmad M. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar, 44Nakanishi M. Adami G. Robetorye R. Noda A. Venable S. Dimitrov D. Pereira-Smith O. Smith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The in vitro induction of C/EBP-δ in mammary epithelial cells after serum and growth factor withdrawal parallels in vivo observations during the immediate postweaning period. 2A. Gigliotti and J. DeWille, manuscript in preparation. Mammary gland C/EBP-δ gene expression is induced early in the postweaning period in conjunction with the decline in lactogenic hormones and preceding the onset of apoptosis in the mammary epithelial compartment (45Guenette R.S. Corbeil H.B. Leger J. Wong K. Mezl V. Mooibroek M. Tenniswood M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 12: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results suggest that C/EBP-δ may play a role in reprogramming the mammary epithelial cell after the removal of hormone and growth factor stimulation. The specific gene(s) transactivated by C/EBP-δ during mammary epithelial cell growth arrest are unknown. However, C/EBP isoforms have been implicated in the transactivation of the β-casein gene during lactation (46Raught B. Liao W.S.-L. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1223-1232PubMed Google Scholar, 47Doppler W. Welte T. Phillipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The rapid decline in C/EBP-δ mRNA following cell cycle initiation suggests that C/EBP-δ expression is tightly linked to the growth-arrested state in COMMA D cells. Similar results have been obtained in HC11 cells, a subline of the COMMA D cell line that retains the capacity for differentiation (data not shown). Preliminary experiments indicate that C/EBP-δ mRNA has a relatively short half-life, about 30 min, in both growing and quiescent COMMA D cells (data not shown). This suggests that the rapid decrease in C/EBP-δ mRNA content (10-fold decrease within 1 h of cell cycle induction) is due to a decrease in C/EBP-δ gene transcription. The role of C/EBP-δ in mammary epithelial cell growth control may be tissue-specific. C/EBP-α has been consistently associated with growth arrest in adipocytes and hepatocytes (4Umek R.M.

Under the conditions employed in these experiments, neither cell type expressed significant amounts of C/EBP-α (3Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

Cell Res. 1993; 208: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although C/EBP-β has been shown to inhibit hepatoma growth, transient increases in C/EBP-β gene expression, nuclear localization, and DNA binding activity occur during the early G1 phase of the cell cycle and after partial hepatectomy (9Flodby P. Antonson P. Barlow C. Blanck A. Porsch-Hallstrom I. Xanthopoulos K.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 48Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R.

Hepatology (Baltimore). 1994; 19: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cell cultures, C/EBP-β mRNA and nuclear protein content also transiently increase during G1. This is consistent with a role for C/EBP-β in the induction of immediate early gene promoters (48Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 49Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology (Baltimore). 1994; 19: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar). Mammary gland C/EBP-β mRNA and protein levels are elevated during the proliferative phase of pregnancy/lactation (45Guenette R.S. Corbeil H.B. Leger J. Wong K. Mezl V. Mooibroek M. Tenniswood M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 12: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Murine CHOP10 shares extensive sequence homology with the hamster growth arrest DNA damage (GADD 153) gene (22Ron D. Habener J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 50Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 51Ubeda M. Wang X.-Z. Zinszer H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHOP10 mRNA is constitutively expressed in adult skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and brain (22Ron D. Habener J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). CHOP10 mRNA is also induced by growth arrest and DNA damage, although the mechanisms of induction under these different conditions may vary (22Ron D. Habener J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Microinjection experiments suggest a role for CHOP10 at the G1/S checkpoint (50Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The rapid and persistent elevation in CHOP10 mRNA content in response to serum and growth factor withdrawal in NIH3T3 cells further supports a role for CHOP10 in the initiation and maintenance of the growth arrest response in fibroblasts. In COMMA D cells, CHOP10 mRNA content declines somewhat early in the growth arrest response, then increases in long term growth arrest, possibly as a result of glucose deprivation in long term cultures (data not shown). Although CHOP10 induction patterns differ between growth-arrested COMMA D and NIH3T3 cells, CHOP10 is induced in both cell types in response to DNA damaging agents (data not shown). Growth arrest-specific (gas) genes, which were originally described in NIH3T3 cells, are induced during growth arrest and down-regulated during G1 (36Schneider C. King R.M. Phillipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 37Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although previous reports suggested that gas genes were not expressed in epithelial cells (29Kallin B. deMartin R. Etzold T. Sorrentino V. Philipson L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5336-5345Crossref Google Scholar), we observed biphasic cell cycle-regulated gas1 mRNA patterns in both COMMA D and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1). These results indicate that gas1 plays a general role in growth control in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. It is of interest that gas1 and C/EBP-δ are representative of a small group of genes that are induced during G0. The novel induction of C/EBP-δ during G0 in mammary epithelial cells suggests that understanding its regulation may have important implications in aberrantly growing cells or in breast cancer. Both C/EBP-δ and CHOP10 form dimers with other bZip proteins and function as DNA-binding proteins (3Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 10Ray A. Hannink M. Ray B.K. J. Biol.

Studies are in progress to identify C/EBP-δ dimerization partners and the genes controlled by these transcription factor complexes during mammary epithelial cell growth arrest. Studies are also in progress to define the molecular mechanisms underlying C/EBP-δ induction during growth arrest. Since the C/EBP-α gene exhibits transcriptional autoregulation, similar regulatory mechanisms may also influence the expression of other C/EBP family members, such as C/EBP-δ (5Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis indicates that the C/EBP-δ transcription initiation site is similar in growing COMMA D cells, growth-arrested COMMA D cells, involuting mammary gland, and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). This suggests that divergent biological signals may converge into a single, or limited number, of transcriptional activators of the C/EBP-δ gene.

https://openalex.org/W2012039654,"Nitric oxide (NO) and L-citrulline are formed from the oxidation of L-arginine by three different isoforms of NO synthase (NOS). Defining amino acid residues responsible for L-arginine binding and oxidation is a primary step toward a detailed understanding of the NOS reaction mechanisms and designing strategies for the selective inhibition of the individual isoform. We have altered Glu-361 in human endothelial NOS to Gln or Leu by site-directed mutagenesis and found that these mutations resulted in a complete loss of L-citrulline formation without disruption of the cytochrome c reductase and NADPH oxidase activities. Optical and EPR spectroscopic studies demonstrated that the Glu-361 mutants had similar spectra either in resting state or reduced CO-complex as the wild type. The heme ligand, imidazole, could induce a low spin state in both wild-type and Glu-361 mutants. However, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the low spin imidazole complex of Glu-361 mutants was not reversed to a high spin state by addition of either L-arginine, acetylguanidine, or 2-aminothiazole. Direct L-arginine binding could not be detected in the mutants either. These results strongly indicate that Glu-361 in human endothelial NOS is specifically involved in the interaction with L-arginine. Mutation of this residue abolished the L-arginine binding without disruption of other functional characteristics.

We have altered Glu-361 in human endothelial NOS to Gln or Leu by site-directed mutagenesis and found that these mutations resulted in a complete loss of L-citrulline formation without disruption of the cytochrome c reductase and NADPH oxidase activities. Optical and EPR spectroscopic studies demonstrated that the Glu-361 mutants had similar spectra either in resting state or reduced CO-complex as the wild type. The heme ligand, imidazole, could induce a low spin state in both wild-type and Glu-361 mutants. However, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the low spin imidazole complex of Glu-361 mutants was not reversed to a high spin state by addition of either L-arginine, acetylguanidine, or 2-aminothiazole. Direct L-arginine binding could not be detected in the mutants either. These results strongly indicate that Glu-361 in human endothelial NOS is specifically involved in the interaction with L-arginine. Mutation of this residue abolished the L-arginine binding without disruption of other functional characteristics."

CPSase III cDNA prepared from embryo mRNA was sequenced, confirming the existence of the CPSase III gene in trout and its expression. The deduced amino acid sequence of the CPSase III is homologous to other CPSases. Supporting evidence for the expression of CPSase III activity in trout embryos was obtained by demonstrating expression of CPSase III mRNA as early as day 3 post-fertilization, reaching a maximum at 10-14 days, declining to a minimum at day 70, and then increasing to a relatively constant level from days 90 to 110 (relative to total RNA). Unexpectedly, in tissues of adult and fingerling trout, CPSase III mRNA was found to be present in muscle but not in other tissues, including liver. This finding was confirmed by assay of extracts, which showed CPSase III and ornithine carbamoyltransferase activity in muscle but not in other tissues.

This enzyme (RS kinase) specifically phosphorylates arginine-serine dipeptide motifs located at the NH2-terminal domain of LBR and regulates its interactions with other nuclear envelope proteins. To compare the phosphorylation state of LBR during interphase and mitosis, we performed phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro and in vivo 32P-labeled LBR and analyzed a series of recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides. Our results show that LBR undergoes two types of mitotic phosphorylation mediated by the RS and the p34cdc2 protein kinases, respectively. The RS kinase modifies similar sites at interphase and mitosis (i.e. Ser76, Ser78, Ser80, Ser82, Ser84), whereas p34cdc2 mainly phosphorylates Ser71.

https://openalex.org/W1493989460,"In the present study we analyzed how oxidative stress conditions induced by ascorbate/ Fe2+ affect the excitatory amino acid (EAA) transport systems in cultured chick retina cells. The uptake of D-[3H]aspartate, which is transported by the same carrier as glutamate, was determined in control cells and in cells subjected to ascorbate/Fe2+. The uptake of this EAA was Na+ dependent and was inhibited by about 40% under oxidative stress conditions. To clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of D-[3H]aspartate uptake by ascorbate/Fe2+, we investigated the effect of vitamin E (Vit E), melatonin, reduced glutathione (GSH), and dithiothreitol (DTT) on the uptake of D-[3H]aspartate and on the extent of lipid peroxidation in control and in peroxidized cells. Preincubation with Vit E (100 microM) abolished lipid peroxidation, but had no significant effect on the inhibition of D-[3H]aspartate uptake evoked by ascorbate/Fe2+. Melatonin was more effective in reducing the formation of TBARS and conjugated dienes than in preventing the D-[3H]aspartate uptake inhibition evoked by the oxidant pair. Conversely, GSH (4 mM) and DTT (4 mM) completely prevented the inhibition of D-[3H]aspartate uptake in cells subjected to oxidative stress, but were without effect on the extent of peroxidation. Free fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, seem not to be involved in reducing the activity of the D-[3H]aspartate uptake system, whereas the reduction of the Na+ electrochemical gradient that occurs under oxidative stress was in part involved in the reduction of D-[3H]aspartate uptake by the cells. The inhibition of D-[3H]aspartate uptake by ascorbate/Fe2+ persisted for at least 1 h, but could be partially reverted by disulfide reducing agents. It is concluded that oxidative stress causes long-lasting modifications of the glutamate/D-[3H]aspartate transport system (or systems), such as oxidation of protein sulfhydryl (SH) groups, which can be recovered by some antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W1766228108,"GTP binding proteins, heterotrimeric molecules composed of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits, are known to serve as transducers of information from seven-transmembrane receptors. Activation of G-proteins has been generally considered to involve subunit dissociation, with G(alpha) separating from G(betagamma). However, we have found a receptor activation of G(i) in proliferating cells that differs from these models and involves the subcellular translocation of the alpha-subunit from the cell periphery to the nucleus where G(i alpha) binds to chromatin for the duration of mitosis. This report describes the mechanism of G(i) activation in Swiss 3T3 cells in response to serum, thrombin, and epidermal growth factor, and describes a role for G(i2) in the cell cycle. Agonists were found to be unable to induce the physical dissociation of G(i2) subunits. The alpha- and beta-subunits of G(i2) could be coimmunoprecipitated with a G(i alpha) antibody from both the membrane and nuclear fractions of long-term activated cultures, showing that G(i alpha 2) and G(i beta) are induced to comigrate to the nucleus in response to growth factor receptor activation. G(i2) appears to be activated in part by a postreceptor signal that can be mimicked by protein kinase C activation; this signal may be responsible for the convergence of the signaling mechanisms of these distinct seven-transmembrane and tyrosine kinase receptors. We suggest that translocation of G(i alpha) to the nucleus induced by either thrombin or EGF may occur without subunit dissociation. Functional studies of the role of G(i) showed that pertussis toxin does not block DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts induced by serum or thrombin, but that cell proliferation is retarded to each. These results provide direct evidence for a novel mechanism of GTP binding protein activation and for an essential role of G(i) in the induction of cell division by a variety of growth factor receptors. G(i) can carry out this role in control of cellular proliferation through its translocation to the nucleus of mitotic cells."

An important determinant for successful docking is the extent to which the configurational space (including conformational changes) of the ligand/receptor system is searched. Here we describe a new, combinatorial method for flexible docking of peptides to proteins that allows full rotation around all single bonds of the peptide ligand and around those of a large set of receptor side chains. We have simulated the binding of several viral peptides to murine major histocompatibility complex class I H-2Kb. In addition, we have explored the limits of our method by simulating a complex between calmodulin and an 18-residue long helical peptide from calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha. The calculated peptide conformations generally matched well with the X-ray structures. Essential information about local flexibility and about residues that are responsible for strong binding was obtained. We have frequently observed considerable side-chain flexibility during the simulations, showing the need for a flexible treatment of the receptor. Our method may also be useful whenever the receptor side-chain conformation is not available or uncertain, as illustrated by the docking of an H-2Kb binding nonapeptide to the receptor structure taken from an octapeptide/H-2Kb complex."

Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Bioamines like dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and octopamine all interact with specific G-protein-coupled receptors. Dopamine is present in high amounts in both vertebrate and invertebrate species. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, on the other hand, are present predominantly in vertebrates, whereas octopamine is considered to act as a major neurotransmitter in invertebrate species only. Octopamine is often referred to as the invertebrate counterpart of norepinephrine because of the structural similarity between these neurotransmitters (they differ only in the presence of a single catecholic hydroxyl group) as well as their functional similarity (both serve an important role in stress adaptation) (2David J.-C. Coulon J.-F. Prog. Neurobiol.(Oxf.). 1985; 24: 141-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consequently, the adrenergic and octopaminergic receptors share pharmacological as well as structural properties (3Evans P.D. Robb S. Neurochem.

In addition, a pharmacological characterization of octopamine receptors has been described for Lymnaea 2S. Juhos, L. Hiripi, M. Eckert, J. Rapus, and K. Elekes, submitted for publication.We have recently cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding an octopamine receptor expressed in the brain of Lymnaea stagnalis (16Gerhardt C.C. Bakker R.A. Piek G.J. Planta R.J. Vreugdenhil E. Leysen J.E. van Heerikhuizen H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This receptor (Lym oa1) shows moderate homology to the Drosophila tyramine/octopamine receptor (17Arakawa S. Gocayne J.D. McCombie W.R. Urquhart D.A. Hall L.M. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and to the vertebrate α-adrenergic receptors. Activation of this receptor, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, leads to elevated concentrations of both intracellular inositol phosphates and cAMP. The pharmacological profile of Lym oa1 suggests that this receptor represents a previously unknown octopamine receptor subtype.This paper describes the structure of a second octopamine receptor cDNA (Lym oa2) cloned from Lymnaea The predicted amino acid sequence of this receptor only shows limited similarity to Lym oa1, as well as to the insect tyramine receptors and the α-adrenergic receptors. Its pharmacological profile clearly differs from that of previously described receptors. When the novel receptor is stably expressed in HEK293 cells, application of octopamine does not lead to changes in the intracellular concentration of cAMP or inositol phosphates. Activation of Lym oa2 does, however, induce a long lasting opening of Cl− channels. G-protein-mediated activation of a similar Cl− current was recently described by Postma et al. (20Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Bot A.G. Alblas J. de Jonge H.R. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in rat fibroblasts. Their study also indicated that none of the known second messenger system was involved in the Cl− channel activation. Nevertheless, it was suggested that the increase in chloride conductance was closely associated with the activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In contrast, our results clearly indicate that this novel signaling pathway functions independently from the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). We further show that although protein kinase A and protein kinase C are most probably not involved in the signaling pathway, protein phosphorylation is important for the opening of the Cl− channel.DISCUSSIONWe have used a degenerate PCR strategy to isolate cDNAs encoding G-protein-coupled bioamine receptors that are expressed in the central nervous system of the pond snail L. stagnalis Recently, we reported the cloning and expression of a serotonin receptor (5-HT2Lym; Ref. 23Gerhardt C.C. Leysen J.E. Planta R.J. Vreugdenhil E. van Heerikhuizen H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 311: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and an octopamine receptor (Lym oa1; Ref. 16Gerhardt C.C. Bakker R.A. Piek G.J. Planta R.J. Vreugdenhil E. Leysen J.E. van Heerikhuizen H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using the same strategy. This paper describes the isolation of a cDNA encoding a second octopamine receptor, designated Lym oa2. The predicted amino acid sequence of Lym oa2 exhibits the highest similarity to the Drosophila tyramine/octopamine receptor, the Locusta tyramine receptor, and Lym oa1, and to the vertebrate α-adrenergic receptors. Although both Lym oa2 and Lym oa1 encode Lymnaea octopamine receptors, their amino acid identity is only moderate, i.e. 45% in the TM regions. An interesting difference in the sequence of both octopamine receptors can be found in TM5. Mutagenesis studies on catecholaminergic receptors have indicated that two conserved serine residues in this domain (Ser204 and Ser207 in the β-adrenergic receptor) play a crucial role in ligand binding. Supposedly, the two Ser hydroxyl groups can hydrogen bond to the catechol hydroxyl groups of the ligand (see for instance Refs. 26Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wang C.D. Buck M.A. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 168-179PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cox B.A. Henningsen R.A. Spanoyannis A. Neve R.L. Neve K.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In octopamine receptors there is no obvious need for conservation of both serine residues in TM5 because the aromatic ring of octopamine is monohydroxylated. Indeed, in Lym oa1 only a single serine is found at the relevant position in TM5. In Lym oa2, however, both serines are present. Interestingly, the catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine) show a considerably higher affinity for Lym oa2 than for Lym oa1 (see Table I). This suggests that the serine residues in TM5 play a role in agonist binding in the Lymnaea octopamine receptors similar to their role in the vertebrate catecholamine receptors.In general, agonists exhibit higher affinities for Lym oa2 than for Lym oa1, while antagonists have higher affinities for Lym oa1 than for Lym oa2. Another interesting difference between the binding properties of both octopamine receptors is the opposite order of affinities for the isoschizomers rauwolscine and yohimbine. Lym oa1 has a higher affinity for yohimbine than for rauwolscine (pKi = 8.9 versus 7.5), while Lym oa2 has a higher affinity for rauwolscine than for yohimbine (pKi = 8.0 versus 6.2). Both the pharmacological profiles of Lym oa1 and Lym oa2 indicate a closer relationship to the α-adrenergic receptors than to the β-adrenergic receptors. In that respect it is noteworthy to mention the much higher affinity of the α1 antagonist prazosine for Lym oa1 (pKi = 7.0) than for Lym oa2 (pKi = 4.7). Whereas the pharmacological profile of Lym oa1 still shows a moderate similarity to that of the Drosophila tyramine/octopamine receptor, the Locusta tyramine receptor, and the α2-adrenergic receptors, the pharmacological profile of Lym oa2 clearly differs from that of Lym oa1, the tyramine receptors, the adrenergic receptors, and the insect octopamine receptor subtypes as described in tissue preparations.Stimulation of Lym oa2 did not lead to the activation of the classical signal transduction pathways mediated by adenylyl cyclase and PLC. The receptor is, however, clearly able to transduce signals since we found that HEK293 cells expressing Lym oa2 showed octopamine-induced changes in their membrane conductance. More specifically, we observed a slow but large increase in the holding current of voltage-clamped HEK293 cells upon application of octopamine. At potentials below the Cl− equilibrium potential, this response was observed as an increase in inward current, most likely caused by an efflux of Cl− ions. The process underlying the opening of the Cl− channels may involve protein phosphorylation, since the (nonselective) protein kinase inhibitor HA1004 inhibited the inward current. Alternatively, the Cl− channels involved may need to be in a phosphorylated state to be able to open in response to the octopamine stimulus. Because the IV relationship of the current response proved to be linear and because no changes in inositol phosphates were observed upon octopamine application, the Cl− channels involved are suggested to be both voltage-independent and Ca2+-independent. Additional effects of octopamine on (voltage-dependent) outward currents were also observed but were not pursued in detail.Interestingly, stimulation of HEK293 cells expressing the other Lymnaea octopamine receptor, Lym oa1, resulted in a similar outward Cl− current. In contrast to Lym oa2, Lym oa1 has previously been shown to activate both PLC and adenylyl cyclase. To examine whether the effect on the Cl− channel might be secondary to the effects on adenylyl cylase and PLC or might represent an independent signaling route, we tested the effect of activation of two other receptors, expressed in HEK293 cells. Stimulation of these receptors, i.e. a Lymnaea serotonin receptor or an endogenous β-adrenergic receptor, led to activation of PLC and adenylyl cyclase, respectively. The subsequent rise in levels of diacylglycerol or cAMP will activate protein kinase C or protein kinase A, respectively. Stimulation of these receptors did, however, not show any effect on the inward current, suggesting that protein kinase C or protein kinase A is not involved in the phosphorylation process underlying Cl− channel activation.It remains to be investigated whether stimulation of Lym oa2 in Lymnaea neurons will also affect the Cl− conductance. Activation of octopamine receptors on neurons of other snails has been described to lead to outward potassium currents (12Cox R.T.L. Walker R.J. Comp. Biochem.

Lett. 1990; 120: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and inward calcium currents (15Pellmar T.C. Brain Res. 1981; 223: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Early studies on Aplysia octopamine receptors (29Levitan I.B. Barondes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown that stimulation of neurons with octopamine induces the specific phosphorylation of a particular unidentified protein. In this case, however, it was suggested that the process might involve protein kinase A, since elevating the intracellular concentration of cAMP produced a similar effect.Recently, it was shown that activation of the G-protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptor present on fibroblasts leads to a long lasting depolarization of these cells due to an efflux of chloride ions (20Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Bot A.G. Alblas J. de Jonge H.R. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As was found in our studies, the signal transduction pathway responsible for opening the chloride channel was suggested to be independent of known second messengers. The opening of this particular chloride channel could also be induced by activation of the thrombin receptor, the endothelin receptor, and the neurokinin A receptor. Since these receptors (as well as the lysophosphatidic acid receptor) all couple to PLC, it was suggested that the signaling pathway leading to the increased Cl− conductance is closely associated with phosphoinositide hydrolysis (20Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Bot A.G. Alblas J. de Jonge H.R. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).All available data suggest that the chloride channel in HEK293 cells that we have found to be G-protein-activated is highly similar to the channel described by Postma et al. (20Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Bot A.G. Alblas J. de Jonge H.R. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our data, however, exclude the option that phosphoinositide hydrolysis is important in the signaling pathway leading from the activated receptor to the opening of the chloride channel, since stimulation of Lym oa2 does not result in any change in intracellular concentrations of inositol phosphates. Also, activation of a serotonin receptor that has been shown to be coupled to the activation of PLC does not influence the outward Cl− current. The G-protein-mediated activation of the chloride channel described by Postma et al. in Rat-1 fibroblasts (20Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Bot A.G. Alblas J. de Jonge H.R. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and by ourselves in HEK293 cells must proceed via an as yet unknown signaling pathway. Here we show that protein phosphorylation is important in this pathway but that protein kinase A and protein kinase C are not involved. The identification of the relevant kinase and the further examination of the signal transduction pathway will be the topics of future investigations.

Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Bioamines like dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and octopamine all interact with specific G-protein-coupled receptors. Dopamine is present in high amounts in both vertebrate and invertebrate species. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, on the other hand, are present predominantly in vertebrates, whereas octopamine is considered to act as a major neurotransmitter in invertebrate species only. Octopamine is often referred to as the invertebrate counterpart of norepinephrine because of the structural similarity between these neurotransmitters (they differ only in the presence of a single catecholic hydroxyl group) as well as their functional similarity (both serve an important role in stress adaptation) (2David J.-C. Coulon J.-F. Prog. Neurobiol.(Oxf.). 1985; 24: 141-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consequently, the adrenergic and octopaminergic receptors share pharmacological as well as structural properties (3Evans P.D. Robb S. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Hiripi L. Juhos S. Downer R.G.H. Brain Res. 1994; 633: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The role of octopamine as a neurotransmitter has been studied particularly well in insects, where it has been shown to interact with at least four different octopamine receptor subtypes (3Evans P.D. Robb S. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The central nervous systems of a number of snails have also been used to study octopaminergic neurotransmission. The presence of octopamine has been demonstrated in the sea slug Aplysia (5Saavedra J.M. Brownstein M.J. Carpenter D.O. Axelrod J.

In general, application of octopamine induces a hyperpolarization of susceptible snail neurons, a process that is thought to be mediated by an increase in cAMP (2David J.-C. Coulon J.-F. Prog.

In addition, a pharmacological characterization of octopamine receptors has been described for Lymnaea 2S. Juhos, L. Hiripi, M. Eckert, J. Rapus, and K. Elekes, submitted for publication.We have recently cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding an octopamine receptor expressed in the brain of Lymnaea stagnalis (16Gerhardt C.C. Bakker R.A. Piek G.J. Planta R.J. Vreugdenhil E. Leysen J.E. van Heerikhuizen H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This receptor (Lym oa1) shows moderate homology to the Drosophila tyramine/octopamine receptor (17Arakawa S. Gocayne J.D. McCombie W.R. Urquhart D.A. Hall L.M. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and to the vertebrate α-adrenergic receptors. Activation of this receptor, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, leads to elevated concentrations of both intracellular inositol phosphates and cAMP. The pharmacological profile of Lym oa1 suggests that this receptor represents a previously unknown octopamine receptor subtype.This paper describes the structure of a second octopamine receptor cDNA (Lym oa2) cloned from Lymnaea The predicted amino acid sequence of this receptor only shows limited similarity to Lym oa1, as well as to the insect tyramine receptors and the α-adrenergic receptors. Its pharmacological profile clearly differs from that of previously described receptors. When the novel receptor is stably expressed in HEK293 cells, application of octopamine does not lead to changes in the intracellular concentration of cAMP or inositol phosphates. Activation of Lym oa2 does, however, induce a long lasting opening of Cl− channels. G-protein-mediated activation of a similar Cl− current was recently described by Postma et al. (20Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Bot A.G. Alblas J. de Jonge H.R. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in rat fibroblasts. Their study also indicated that none of the known second messenger system was involved in the Cl− channel activation. Nevertheless, it was suggested that the increase in chloride conductance was closely associated with the activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In contrast, our results clearly indicate that this novel signaling pathway functions independently from the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). We further show that although protein kinase A and protein kinase C are most probably not involved in the signaling pathway, protein phosphorylation is important for the opening of the Cl− channel."

Following activation and purification, recombinant thrombin (rIIa) and stable analogues of meizothrombin (rMZa) and meizothrombin(desF1) (rMZdesF1a) were obtained. Studies of the activation of protein C in the presence of recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (TM) show TM-dependent stimulation of protein C activation by all three enzymes and, in the presence of phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine phospholipid vesicles, rMZa is 6-fold more potent than rIIa. In the presence of TM, rMZa was also shown to be an effective activator of TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) (Bajzar, L., Manuel, R., and Nesheim, M. E. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 14477-14484). All three enzymes were capable of inducing platelet aggregation, but 60-fold higher concentrations of rMZa and rMZdesF1a were required to achieve the effects obtained with rIIa.

Chem. 1979; 254: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar–17Lindhout T. Baruch D. Schoen P. Franssen J. Hemker H.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is inhibited by antithrombin III with a second order rate constant approximately 2-3-fold lower than that for α-thrombin, and the interaction is not promoted by heparin (16Schoen P. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11268-11274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lindhout T. Baruch D. Schoen P. Franssen J. Hemker H.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Active-site blocked meizothrombin was also shown to have no heparin-neutralizing properties as opposed to active-site blocked thrombin (18Pieters J. Franssen J. Visch C. Lindhout T. Thromb. Res. 1987; 45: 573-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Evidence obtained in vitro indicates that meizothrombin is a major intermediate during the clotting of whole blood (19Bovill E.G. Tracy R.P. Hayes T.E. Jenny R.J. Bhushan F.H. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, a study ex vivo using human umbilical vein endothelial cells demonstrated the formation of meizothrombin and the accumulation of meizothrombin(desF1) during prothrombin activation (20Tijburg P.N.M. van Heerde W.L. Leenhouts H.M. Hessing M. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4017-4022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Meizothrombin was also shown to have vasoconstrictive activity 5-fold greater than that of α-thrombin (21Thompson L.P. Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. Bevan J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 410aGoogle Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that meizothrombin and/or meizothrombin(desF1) produced in vivo have functions different from those of thrombin. Studies of these two intermediates in vitro, however, are complicated by their transient nature resulting in their conversion to thrombin. Previously, we reported the expression in mammalian cells of the recombinant human prothrombin derivative rMZ (R155A,R271A,R284A) (4Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can be activated to a stable form of meizothrombin (rMZa). A second prothrombin derivative rMZdesF1 (R271A,R284A) (10Stevens W.K. Côté H.C.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8062-8067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) which can be activated to a stable form of meizothrombin(desF1) (rMZdesF1a) was also produced. The molecules were stabilized via arginine to alanine mutations at one of the two factor Xa cleavage sites and either one or both of the thrombin cleavage sites. The enzymatic activities of rMZa and rMZdesF1a toward fibrinogen and small substrates (4Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol.

Biol Chem. 1986; 261: 4224-4228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10693-10701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in studies of native meizothrombin. In addition, the Ca2+ and phospholipid binding properties of prothrombin are retained by rMZa (4Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these activated mutants are useful surrogates for meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1). Consequently, the present studies were undertaken to analyze their functional properties and compare them to those of recombinant human thrombin (rIIa). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12 (1:1), Opti-MEM, Ultroser G, and newborn calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Methotrexate was from David Bull Laboratories (Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), and vitamin K1 was purchased from Sabex (Boucherville, Quebec) or Abbott Laboratories (Montreal, Quebec). The BHK cell line and pNUT vector were gifts from Dr. Richard Palmiter (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Washington). The chromogenic substrates S-2238 and S-2366 were from Helena Laboratories (Mississauga, Ontario). Phospholipid vesicles (75% PC/25% PS (w/w)) were prepared as described previously (22Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Human Factor X (1Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein C (25Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified and activated as described previously. TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) was isolated by anion exchange, gel filtration, and plasminogen-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (26Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The purity of all proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis. Additionally, thrombin activity was absent from the protein C and TAFI preparations as assayed by S-2238. Antithrombin III was provided by Alpha Therapeutics and further purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (27Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14708-14717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human thrombomodulin (TMLEO) was purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells and characterized as described (28Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Lin J.-H. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This protein is a soluble form of TM comprising amino acids 4 to 490, with the following mutations M388L, R456G, H457Q, and S474A, and does not contain the chondroitin sulfate side chain (29Lin J.-H.

Hirudin was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Heparin (grade I) (used in platelet preparation), prostaglandin E1, and apyrase (grade V) were from Sigma. Heparin PMH 146000 (used for the AT-III study) was from Fisher (Whitby, Ontario). DAPA was prepared as described (30Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The prothrombin activator of Echis carinatus venom (Sigma) was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and preparative electrophoresis in polyacrylamide as described previously (3Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Bio-Rad protein assay dye was from Bio-Rad Laboratories. The construction of the new pNUT-hMZdesF1 expression vector was accomplished by isolation and ligation of restriction digest fragments from the wild type prothrombin construct and the rMZ construct (4Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a BstEII fragment from pNUT-hII encoding part of the promoter region and amino acids Met−43 to Ala183 of the human wild type prothrombin was ligated into the BstEII-digested pNUT-hMZ construct encoding amino acids Val184 to Glu579 of rMZ and the pNUT vector. The cDNAs encoding wild type human prothrombin, hMZ and hMZdesF1, cloned into the expression vector pNUT, were stably transfected into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells as described previously (4Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protein production, the cells were seeded in roller bottles and cultured until confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum and 440 μM methotrexate. After 3-4 days, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 and subsequently cultured in 0.5% Ultroser G or Opti-MEM (supplemented with 50 μM ZnCl2) containing 10 μg/ml vitamin K1. With the exception of the 1st day, the medium was collected every day (150-200 ml), pooled, and stored at 4°C. The conditioned medium was concentrated using an Amicon CH2 concentrator with a S1Y10 spiral cartridge, and rMZ was purified as described previously (4Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rMZdesF1 was purified similarly except that the chromatography using a Ca2+ gradient was omitted. Wild type recombinant human prothrombin (rII) was activated by addition of the prothrombinase complex (5 nM Factor Xa, 5 nM Factor Va, 10 μM phospholipid vesicles, and 5 mM CaCl2) directly to the conditioned medium (Opti-MEM). The activation mixture was then purified on an SPC-50 column (2 ml) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 at 22°C. Recombinant thrombin (rIIa) was eluted from the column with 20 mM HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing rIIa were identified by amidolytic activity using S-2238. This procedure yielded pure rIIa as judged by SDS-PAGE, with 100% activity as measured by active-site titration. Both rMZ and rMZdesF1 were activated with ecarin. Briefly, ecarin (1.5 μg/ml) was added to the pure protein in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 at 22°C. After 45 min, the activation mixture was chromatographed at 22°C on a column of benzamidine-Sepharose (2 ml) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4. After a wash, the enzymes were eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mM benzamidine. Fractions containing the proteases were identified by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The pooled fractions containing the active proteins were dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4, and then concentrated, if necessary, using a Centricon PM30 membrane (Amicon, Danvers, MA). For rMZdesF1a, the removal of fragment 1 was complete with no zymogen remaining, as indicated by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions. This suggests that the feedback cleavage at position Arg155-Ser156 is carried out by meizothrombin/meizothrombin(desF1) and does not require the presence of endogenously formed α-thrombin. Both rMZa and rMZdesF1a were found to be 80-85% active. The concentration of active proteases (rIIa, rMZa, and rMZdesF1a) was determined by titration with PPA·CK. Small aliquots (3.2 μl) of PPA·CK (5 μM) were added to a protein sample (1.6 ml at 100 nM) containing 200 nM DAPA, and the decrease in fluorescence due to the displacement of DAPA from the active site was monitored (λex = 280 nm, λem = 545 nm) in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. Plots of fluorescence intensity versus the concentration of PPA·CK were constructed, and extrapolation to the baseline fluorescence values yielded the active-site concentrations of each protease. The interaction of the recombinant proteins with hirudin was measured similarly. Briefly, small aliquots (3.2 μl) of hirudin (5 μM) were added to a protein sample (1.6 ml at 100 nM) containing 200 nM DAPA, and the decrease in fluorescence was monitored (λex = 280 nm, λem = 545 nm). The displacement of DAPA by hirudin was considered to be the result of two competing equilibrium binding interactions, E + HE·H and E + DE·D, characterized by dissociation constants KH and KD (E, H, and D represent enzyme, hirudin, and DAPA, respectively). By utilizing the binding equations [E][H] = KH[E·H] and [E][D] = KD[E·D], plus the conservation equations [E]0 = [E] + [E·D] + [E·H], and [H]0 = [H] + [E·H], the following equation was derived, which relates fluorescence intensity (proportional to [E·D] with proportionality constant C); the concentrations of hirudin, enzyme, and DAPA and the dissociation constants for the enzyme-DAPA and the enzyme-hirudin interactions. I545 = C × (0.5) × (1/(1 + KD/D)) × (E0− H0− KH(1 + D/KD) + ((E0− H0− KH(1 + D/KD))2+ 4 × E0× KH(1 + D/Kd))1/2). Since [D] = 200 nM, KD = 20 nM, and [E0] = 100 nM, the above equation can be written as follows: I545 = C × (0.455) × (100 − H0− 11 × KH+ ((100 − H0− 11 × KH)2+ 4400 × KH)1/2). The above equation with H0 substituted by a × H0 to compensate for slight differences between the nominal and active concentrations of hirudin was fit by nonlinear regression to the intensity versus [hirudin] data with C, a, and KH as fit parameters, thereby yielding the dissociation constant for the enzyme, hirudin interactions. Platelets were prepared from freshly drawn blood, using a modification of the method described by Mustard et al. (31Mustard J.F. Perry D.W. Ardlie N.G. Packham M.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Platelets were washed once in TA buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 0.42 mM NaH2PO4, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mM glucose, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.35) containing 30 μg/ml apyrase, 5 μM prostaglandin E1, 28 units/ml heparin, and washed again in the same buffer without the heparin. The platelets were finally resuspended in TA buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 3 μg/ml apyrase (HTA). The number of platelets in a small aliquot (10 μl) was determined in a Baker System 9000 Cell Counter. Aggregation studies were carried out in a single-chamber Payton Aggregation Module (Payton Scientific, Buffalo, NY) using siliconized glass cuvettes. Gain settings were adjusted to give 90% transmittance for HTA buffer and 10% for the starting platelet suspension. Varying amounts of rIIa, rMZa, and rMZdesF1a were added to platelets (1 × 108/ml) in HTA buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2. The aggregation of the platelets was followed continuously by measuring the percentage of the increment in light transmittance with time. The platelet preparation was tested for its response to rIIa (0.8 nM) at the beginning and the end of the experiment. Human protein C, TM, and PCPS vesicles were incubated in various combinations and concentrations in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 37°C in the wells of a microtiter plate. The reactions were initiated by the addition of rIIa, rMZa, or rMZdesF1a in the same buffer. Final concentrations were: protein C, 1.0 μM; TM, 0-80 nM, PCPS vesicles, 0-400 μM, and the enzymes, 0.5 or 2.0 nM. After 10 min, protein C activation was terminated by the addition of 150 μl of a solution containing 0.33 mM S-2366, 10 mM EDTA, and 30 μM DAPA in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The conversion of S-2366 by activated protein C (APC) was followed by determining the absorbance at 405 nm, at 1-min intervals for 30 min. A control experiment performed in the absence of recombinant protease showed no conversion of the substrate. APC concentrations were calculated from the rates of change of A405 with time in conjunction with a standard curve generated with purified APC. Rates of protein C activation were calculated from the concentration of APC measured after 10 min of incubation. The data were subsequently fit by non-linear regression analyses to the saturation equation r = Rmax·[TM]/(Kd+ [TM]) using SYSTAT software (Systat, Evanston, IL). In this equation, r = rate of protein C activation, Rmax= rate at saturating TM, and Kd is the TM concentration when r = Rmax/2. Similarly, rates versus PCPS concentrations were fit to the equation r = R0+ΔRmax·[PCPS]/(Kd+ [PCPS]) where R0 is the rate in the absence of PCPS, ΔRmax is the maximum increment in rate achieved with PCPS, and Kd indicates the PCPS level needed to obtain half the maximum increment. TAFI (0, 0.26, 0.52, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, and 1.75 μM) was incubated with rMZa (10 nM), and TM (0, 1.56, 3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, and 50.0 nM) in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 22°C. Reactions were quenched by adding PPA·CK (50 μM, final concentration). An aliquot (25 μl) was then added to hippurylarginine (400 μM, final concentration), and the rate of hydrolysis by activated TAFI (TAFIa) was monitored at 254 nm in a Perkin-Elmer lambda 4B spectrophotometer. TAFIa levels were calculated from the kcat (22 s−1) and Km (180 μM) values for the hydrolysis of hippurylarginine, and initial rates of TAFI activation were calculated from the TAFIa levels. For all experiments, the extent of TAFI consumption during the 10-min incubation never exceeded 15% of the initial concentration. The analysis of the data indicated saturation in rates with respect to levels of TAFI, a Km value that was not affected by the level of TM, and saturation of Vmax values with respect to TM concentrations. These observations are consistent with model D of the seven possible equilibrium models for a three-component (enzyme, substrate, cofactor) system described previously (3Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, all of the data were fit globally by non-linear regression analysis to the equation rate = kcat[rMZa·TM]·[TAFI]/(Km+ [TAFI]) where [rMZa·TM] is given by the quadratic equation [rMZa·TM] = 0.5·(Kd+ rMZa + TM − ((Kd+ rMZa + TM)2− 4·rMZa·TM)1/2). Non-linear regression analyses provided measures of kcat, Km, and Kd (for the rMZa-TM interaction). For each assay, 135 μl of enzyme (rIIa, rMZa, or rMZdesF1a) (5.8 nM final) was incubated with 20 μl of AT-III (final concentrations 0 to 3.87 μM) at 22°C for 0 to 30 min. The remaining activity was then assayed by adding 10 μl of the sample to 190 μl of S-2238 (final concentration 0.4 mM in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4). The conversion of S-2238 was followed by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm at 30-s intervals for up to 30 min at 37°C in a Titre-Tek Twin reader. The data were plotted as ln[active enzyme] versus time, and, from the slopes, the pseudo-first order rate constants were calculated. The second order rate constants were calculated from plots of the slopes of the pseudo-first order rate constants versus the AT-III concentrations. For the inhibition by AT-III in the presence of heparin, a protein sample (rIIa, rMZa, or rMZdesF1a) (1.6 ml, 25 nM) in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 500 nM DAPA, pH 7.4, was placed at 22°C in a Perkin-Elmer MPF-66 fluorescence spectrophotometer. A small aliquot of AT-III (1.0 μM final concentration) was added, and fluorescence was monitored (λex = 280 nm, λem = 545 nm). At 100 s, heparin (6 units/ml) was added to the sample, and the displacement of DAPA from the active site by AT-III over time was monitored by fluorescence. As shown by Fig. 1 and the parameters derived from these experiments in Table TI, TM stimulates the activation of protein C not only by rIIa, but also by rMZa and rMZdesF1a. The reactions were performed in the presence of Ca2+ (5 mM) and in the absence of PCPS vesicles. Saturation of rates with respect to the concentration of TM was observed with all three enzymes, and the concentrations required to achieve one-half the maximum rate ranged from 24-35 nM (for rIIa and rMZdesF1a) to 63-72 nM (for rMZa). The rates at saturation ranged from 5-6 mol of protein C converted per mol of enzyme per min with rIIa and rMZa and approximately 4 with rMZdesF1a. The Kd values reported for the thrombin-TM interaction by others (28Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Lin J.-H. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) are generally lower than those observed here. This is most likely a consequence of the higher salt concentration (0.15 M versus 0.10 M) used here. 2C. T.

The archaeon (archaebacterium) Haloferax volcanii belongs to the more moderate halophilic archaea, growing best in a medium containing 2 mol/liter NaCl and 0.25 mol/liter MgCl2 at pH 7 (1Dane M. Steinert K. Esser K. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Rodriguez-Valera F. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1992; 47: 835-844Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The proton-conducting ATPase of this archaeon is a halophilic enzyme that shows maximum activity at 1.75 mol/liter NaCl. It was characterized recently with respect to its hydrolytic function (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys.

The membrane-bound ATPases from archaea share properties with both bacterial (formerly eubacterial) and eucaryal (formerly eukaryotic) ATPases. Like F0F1-ATPases, they are able to synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate coupled to a proton flow. Genetically derived amino acid sequences of the large subunits of archaeal ATPases (2Steinert K.

The primary structures of subunits A and B of H. volcanii are closely related to those of Halobacterium salinarium (halobium) (6Ihara K. Mukohata Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and indeed more related to the class of the eucaryal V-ATPases. On the other hand, the function of eucaryal V-ATPases is to generate a Δμ_∼H+ at the expense of ATP hydrolysis; they are not able to synthesize ATP in a reversed reaction. More detailed investigations on the intermediate position of different archaeal ATPases are required. Up to now, almost nothing was known about the small subunits of halophilic ATPases. F-ATPases have one copy each of three different small subunits, γ, δ, and ε, which are involved in proton conduction and/or regulation (for review, see Refs. 12Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar and 13Pedersen P.L. Hullihen J. Bianchet M. Amzel L.M. Lebowitz M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1775-1784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). V-ATPases, as far as we know, have three to four different small subunits, C, D, E, and F. We know almost nothing about the function of these subunits (for review, see Ref. 14Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 149-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This paper reports on the proton-dependent ATP synthesis of the H. volcanii ATPase, the purification and immunodetection of subunits, and the nucleotide sequence of the ATPase operon encoding the A1 part of the enzyme that contains three small subunits as in F-ATPases. H. volcanii WR 340 was grown in a medium containing (w/v each) 16.2% NaCl, 3% MgSO4, 1% KCl, 0.08% CaCl2, 40 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.43% peptone, and 0.26% yeast extract according to Ref. 15Cline S.W. Lam W.L. Charlebois R.L. Schalwyk L. Ford Doolittle W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar. H. volcanii cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10°C in a Beckman centrifuge (Model J2-21) at 5000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were pooled, resuspended, and washed with a medium containing 1.75 mol/liter NaCl and 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7. After centrifugation, the cell concentration was adjusted to a value corresponding to 60 A520, followed by sonication on ice for 3 × 30 s (Branson sonifier with microtip). By this method, up to 80% inside-out vesicles were made as shown by the membrane-bound menadione-dependent NADH dehydrogenase reaction. After centrifugation (4°C, 8000 × g, 30 min), the supernatants were collected and transferred to a Beckman ultracentrifuge (Model L8-70M) to remove the remaining unruptured cells, followed by ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 140,000 × g and 4°C. The resulting pellet, containing the vesicles, was collected in a small volume of 1.75 mol/liter NaCl and 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7, and again centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 5 min. Aliquots of this suspension were used for measurements of ATP synthesis. Acid/base-dependent ATP synthesis (by alkalization of the outer medium) was measured by the addition of vesicles prepared at pH 7 (see above) in a medium comprising 20 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter Pi, 5 mmol/liter ADP, 1.75 mmol/liter NaCl, and 50 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 9. The final volume was 700 μl, and the temperature was adjusted to 40°C, if not indicated otherwise. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of prepared vesicles (see above) and stopped after the indicated times by adding 100-μl portions to 100 μl of perchloric acid (final concentration of 0.5 mol/liter). Immediate neutralization of the samples was followed by centrifugation and determination of the ATP concentration by the luciferin/luciferase reaction (Pharmacia Luminometer). ATP was determined in a medium containing 0.1 mol/liter Tris/acetic acid, pH 7.75, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 5 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter K2SO4, and 50 μl of luciferase reagent (ATP bioluminescence kit, CLS II, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μl of neutralized supernatant (see above) to 500 μl of reaction medium. The isolation procedure was performed according to Denda et al. (16Denda K. Konishi J. Oshima T. Date T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7119-7121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes of H. volcanii (∼400 mg of protein) were suspended in 60 ml of 50 mM Tricine, pH 7.5, followed by ultracentrifugation (140,000 × g, 55 min), and were washed twice. The precipitated membranes were resuspended in 60 ml of diethyl ether and precipitated by centrifugation (7000 × g, 10 min). We repeated the washing procedure twice. After resuspension of the pellet in 60 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, plus 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol), the suspension was stirred overnight at 4°C. The addition of 20 ml of water and centrifugation at 7000 × g for 15 min resulted in two phases. The lower organic phase was concentrated to a final volume of 2 ml and mixed with 8 ml of ice-cold (−20°C) diethyl ether. We collected the resulting pellet by centrifugation and washed it with ice-cold acetone. This final pellet was dried under vacuum, followed by resuspension with ∼100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and stored at −20°C. Protein determinations were performed according to Bensadoun and Weinstein (17Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from H. volcanii WR 340 was prepared as described previously (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). RNA preparation was carried out according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Northern and Southern hybridization experiments were performed according to standard protocols (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). α-32P-Labeled gene probes were obtained by using the random-primed labeling kit from Boehringer. Restriction fragments were subcloned in pBluescript SK− and pUC19, respectively, using Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue as host. Sequencing was carried out by employing the dideoxy chain termination method (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Regions forming secondary structures during sequencing reactions or during electrophoresis were additionally sequenced with the TaQence kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) using Taq polymerase, both with and without 7-deaza-dGTP. Furthermore, the T7 sequencing kit was used together with 7-deaza-dGTP and 7-deaza-dATP. The protein distribution of crude membranes, isolated protein, and isolated subunit c of the ATPase fractions was studied on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15%) (21Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) after silver staining (22Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Pharmacia Biotech RE-034. Piscataway, NJ1986Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the proteolipid was estimated from the positions of standard proteins. Polyclonal antisera against synthetic peptides of subunits A and B of the Haloferax ATPase were raised in rabbits and used as probes in Western blots to confirm that the purified protein represents the A1A0-ATPase from H. volcanii The oligopeptides used were DEKWEFEPTVSEGDE (amino acids 123-137 of subunit A) and EDDYEDDAESVEAER (the final 15 amino acids of subunit B) (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out as described earlier (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Archaea are able to convert a transmembrane potential into ATP using an ATP synthase that is in some respects similar to F- and V-type ATPases from other organisms. H. volcanii contains an A0A1-ATPase that has been characterized with respect to the ATP hydrolyzing capacity. Conditions for the ATPase function are high NaCl concentrations, a medium pH of 9, and the presence of divalent cations. The optimal temperature for ATP hydrolysis is 60°C (1Dane M. Steinert K. Esser K. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Rodriguez-Valera F. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1992; 47: 835-844Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis performed by membrane vesicles of H. volcanii should be due to this enzyme. To confirm this, it was essential to analyze the optimal conditions for the ATP synthesis reaction. ATP synthesis in washed membranes of H. volcanii was optimal at pH 9. Lower pH values decreased the activity very strongly, whereas at pH 10, 75% of the optimal activity was left. The optimal temperature for ATP synthesis is 60°C, whereas at 25°C, only 10% of the optimal activity was obtained (30% at 70°C). In contrast to the ATP hydrolysis reaction, where Mn2+ and Mg2+ could be used almost equally, the ATP synthesis reaction strictly depends on Mg2+. Mn2+ can replace Mg2+, but with a dramatic loss of activity (Fig. 1). Like ATP hydrolysis, ATP synthesis could be performed in 1.75 mol/liter KCl instead of NaCl. Using Mg2+ and ADP as substrates, we determined a Michaelis-Menten constant of 0.67 mmol/liter (ADP) and a Vmax of 18.2 nmol of ATP/mg of protein/min; using Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ diminished the Vmax to 7.1 nmol of ATP/mg of protein/min (Fig. 1). The ATP synthase activity was inhibited neither by the F-ATPase inhibitors 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (up to 1 mmol/liter) and phlorizin (up to 2 mmol/liter) nor by the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin (0.1 mmol/liter). N-Ethylmaleimide, a potent V-ATPase inhibitor, caused only a 5-10% loss of activity if the vesicles were preincubated for 2 h and a concentration of 10 mmol/liter was employed. These results are in accordance with our previous analysis of ATP hydrolysis by the Haloferax ATPase (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Incubation of the membranes overnight at 4°C in the presence of 1 mmol/liter N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide resulted in a residual activity of 18% of the ATP synthesis rate measured with vesicles that were stored under the same conditions without N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Lower concentrations of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and short incubation times had only negligible effects. Carboxyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, an uncoupler of photophosphorylation in photosynthesis, is able to diminish ATP synthesis very effectively if added in relatively high concentrations (final concentration of 200 μmol/liter carboxyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone in the experiment shown in Fig. 2). In contrast, the ionophore nigericin is effective at concentrations that are 2 orders of magnitude lower (50% inhibition at a concentration of 4 μmol/liter (data not shown)). H. volcanii ATP synthase was removed from the membranes by passing the membranes through a French press at 20,000 p.s.i. (23Hochstein L.I. Kristjansson H. Altekar W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was purified by fractionated precipitation using polyethylene glycol. Most of the ATP hydrolysis activity was found in the 25% polyethylene glycol fraction. The respective pellet was applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with 1.75 mol/liter NaCl plus 50 mmol/liter Tricine, pH 7.5, and 200 mmol/liter MgCl2. After this procedure, a purification factor of 90 and a corresponding yield of 32% were achieved. The specific activity (ATP hydrolysis) of the purified enzyme is 31.4 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min. When the eluate of the Superose column was subjected to SDS-PAGE, polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 70, 63, 55, 43, and 37 kDa were observed in addition to smaller peptides. Employing further purification methods, e.g. ammonium sulfate-mediated HPLC (24Leicht W. Pundak S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), resulted in additional small bands and in a dramatic loss of activity (to ∼10% of the original activity). Examining the immunological reactivity of the membranes with antisera against oligopeptides that were constructed according to the deduced amino acid sequences of the large subunits A and B (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we found that in the membrane fraction, one 70-kDa peptide (subunit A) and one 55-kDa peptide (subunit B) were labeled (Fig. 3). However, when fractions of the Superose gel filtration product were studied employing the antisera, a diminished 70-kDa band and an additionally labeled 51-kDa peptide (subunit A) were obtained (Fig. 3). Obviously, a fragment of 18.3 kDa was split from the 70-kDa protein employing gel filtration. The gel filtration product of subunit B showed immunological reactivity with the 55- and 70-kDa peptides (Fig. 3). At least two additional bands were labeled when the product of a subsequent HPLC column (ammonium sulfate-mediated chromatography) was studied with the help of Western blots (data not shown). Despite the high sodium chloride concentration maintained during every step of purification, degradation of the halophilic ATPase seems to be unavoidable. To obtain more data concerning the structure of the archaeal ATPases, we cloned and sequenced the atpA and atpB genes of the archaeon H. volcanii (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). When sequencing atpA and atpB, we found that at least two more open reading frames exist upstream of atpA, whereas no reading frame can be found downstream of atpB Moreover, Northern blot experiments using polymerase chain reaction products of subunits A and B (2Steinert K. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as probes resulted in a single labeled mRNA transcript of ∼5 kilobase pairs in both cases, supporting the idea of an A1-encoding operon (Fig. 4). We cloned two genomic DNA fragments, both overlapping with the previously described fragment containing atpA and atpB, and sequenced these fragments completely in both directions. Fig. 5 shows the restriction map for this region.Fig. 5Restriction map of the atp gene cluster encoding the subunits of the A1 part of the H. volcanii ATPase.

Upstream of atpD, a 5′-untranslated region of 550 base pairs exists. The noncoding regions between all reading frames are extremely short: atpA is only four nucleotides apart from atpB; there is a spacer of 6 base pairs between atpA and atpE; and the start and stop codons of the reading frames in front of atpE even overlap by 4 base pairs each. The reading frames atpD, atpC, and atpE were translated into amino acid sequences of 194, 348, and 106 residues, respectively (Fig. 6). The calculated molecular masses of the ATPase subunits are 22.03 (subunit D), 38.76, (subunit C), and 11.58 (subunit E) kDa. There are three reasons to assume that the A1-ATPase genes are organized in a single operon. (i) A single transcript of ∼5 kilobase pairs was detected by Northern hybridization; (ii) there is a typical promoter region (Fig. 6, boxed) together with a large 5′-untranslated region; and (iii) we found a pyrimidine-rich transcription termination sequence (Fig. 6, underlined).Fig. 6Fig. 6.

In the latter eubacterium, a H+-translocating F-ATPase resides besides a Na+-translocating V-ATPase that plays an important role at high pH, where the proton potential is not generated. Comparing the translated amino acid sequence for atpD with F-ATPase δ-subunits, which have similar molecular masses (spinach chloroplast ATPase δ-subunit, 20.5 kDa (27Hermans J. Rother C. Bichler J. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 19: 323-330Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar); and Odontella sinensis δ-subunit, 21.1 kDa (28Pancic P.G. Strotmann H. Kowallik K.V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)), resulted in very low similarities of 12 and 13%, respectively. We found no significant similarity comparing the atpD product with the γ-subunit of the Sulfolobus ATPase. Although the overall sequence homology among the compared proteins is very poor, the N- and C-terminal regions revealed some degree of sequence conservation. Cross-link experiments have shown that the N-terminal region is involved in the connection of the δ-subunit to subunit I of the membrane part of chloroplast ATPase (29Beckers G. Berzborn R.J. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The δ-subunit (subunit D) is supposed to be involved in proton conduction from the membrane-integral part to the catalytic subunits. The second reading frame, overlapping with the first one by four nucleotides, was translated into 348 amino acids, resulting in a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 38.7 kDa. The calculated molecular mass of the atpC gene product corresponds to the size of the partially purified enzyme of 37 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Table II). The size of subunit C is comparable to various C subunits of V-ATPases, e.g. subunit C of E. hirae (Fig. 7). The similarity between subunit C of V-ATPases from different sources and/or the γ-subunit of F-ATPases is generally not very strong. Only 17% identical residues could be found comparing H. volcanii subunit C with Enterococcus subunit C (Fig. 7).Table II.Molecular masses of the H+-ATPase subunits of H. volcaniiSubunitNucleotidesAmino acidsMolecular massSequenceaAs calculated from deduced amino acids.SDS-PAGEbAs deduced by denatured PAGE.A176158664.570cCalculated from the Western blot shown in Fig. 2.B140746852.055cCalculated from the Western blot shown in Fig. 2.C104734838.737D58519422.0NDdNF, not found; ND, not done.E32110611.612cNDNDND9.7a As calculated from deduced amino acids.bs As deduced by denatured PAGE.c Calculated from the Western blot shown in Fig. 2.d NF, not found; ND, not done. Open table in a new tab The third reading frame, translated into a sequence of 106 amino acids with a molecular mass 11.58 kDa, was compared with the 14-kDa subunit (subunit F) of the V-ATPase from the hawk moth Manduca sexta The atpE gene product of H. volcanii showed 23% identical amino acids when compared with this only known subunit F of eucaryal V-ATPases. An amount of 16% identical amino acids was found when comparing subunit E with E. hirae subunit G (Fig. 7), but only 12% was found when comparing with ε-subunits of F-ATPases. Despite the poor similarity, the amino terminus of the sequence shows rather high identity to M. sexta subunit F and E. hirae subunit G: 10 of 22 amino acids are identical or conservative exchanges. Since the H. volcanii ATPase operon does not contain a gene coding for the membrane-spanning proton channel or subunit c, we isolated this peptide from the membranes according to Denda et al. (16Denda K. Konishi J. Oshima T. Date T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7119-7121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kakinuma et al. (30Kakinuma Y. Kakinuma S. Takase K. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Yamato I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After purification, a single protein was obtained with a molecular mass of 9.7 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. To identify this protein, it was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and transferred to a gas-phase sequencer for automatic amino acid sequence analysis. The first 10 amino acids (Fig. 8) indicate that the peptide is related to the proteolipids (c subunits) of E. coli and spinach chloroplast ATPase, whereas there is almost no similarity to the N terminus of the respective peptide of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (30Kakinuma Y. Kakinuma S. Takase K. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Yamato I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). So far there is only one complete archaeal ATPase operon described in the literature: the acidothermophile archaeon S. acidocaldarius contains five genes encoding hydrophilic polypeptides (atpD, atpA, atpB, atpG, and atpE) that precede one gene (atpP) coding for a very hydrophobic subunit (c or “proteolipid”) (31Denda K. Konishi J. Hajiro K. Oshima T. Date T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21509-21513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The authors describe the small subunits to have no significant similarity either to F-ATPase or to eucaryal V-ATPase subunits, whereas the large α- and β-subunits and the channel-building subunit c do have homologous counterparts in other ATPases. The H. volcanii ATPase operon is the first reported halophilic archaeal ATPase gene cluster. In Fig. 9, the arrangement of the Haloferax genes is compared with the respective operon of the archaeon S. acidocaldarius (31Denda K. Konishi J. Hajiro K. Oshima T. Date T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21509-21513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gene arrangement coding for the V-ATPase (Na+-ATPase) from E. hirae (32Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the F-ATPase gene clusters from E. coli (33Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and Rhodospirillum rubrum (34Falk G. Hampe A. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) are shown. The most surprising finding was that the Haloferax operon is quite different from the operon in the acidothermophilic archaeon S. acidocaldarius, whereas complete correspondence could be found when comparing the Haloferax operon with the eubacterial E. hirae Na+-ATPase gene cluster. Thus, our finding indicates a conserved operon structure for V- and A-ATPases. In a very recent paper, Wilms et al. (47Wilms R. Freiberg C. Wegerle E. Meier I. Mayer F. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18843-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported on the organization of a gene cluster encoding the archaeal ATP synthase from Methanosarcina mazei Gö1. This gene cluster combines the arrangement of that of H. volcanii with the one of S. acidocaldarius since it contains genes homologous to the Sulfolobus γ- and ε-subunits. In Enterococcus, the proteolipid-encoding gene is atpK, positioned in front of atpE, which encodes the peptide homologous to H. volcanii subunit D. The operon of the S. acidocaldarius ATPase ends with the gene for the hydrophobic subunit c that builds up the proton-conducting, membrane-spanning part of the ATPase. In the photosynthetic bacterium R. rubrum, the F1- and F0-subunits are encoded by different operons, which are transcribed independently (34Falk G. Hampe A. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This may also be true for H. volcanii since we could not find any coding region for the hydrophobic membrane part or for a related membrane-spanning protein. The molecular mass of the so-called proteolipid in the F0 part of F-ATPases is ∼8 kDa, whereas V-ATPases possess proteolipids with molecular masses of ∼16 kDa, consisting of four membrane-spanning helices. A data bank search revealed that the first half and the last half of the protein are both similar to the F-ATPase proteolipid (35Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J. Pan Y. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, both proteolipids are proposed to have originated from a common ancestral gene that underwent gene duplication (35Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J. Pan Y. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). From the structures described above and the apparent similarities of F-, A-, and V-ATPases, the structure of the Haloferax ATP synthase has been predicted on the basis of the well known structure of F-ATPases (36Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Since the universal phylogenetic tree has been restructured by Woese et al. (37Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4574-4579Google Scholar), the halophilic bacteria belong to the Euryarchaeota together with the methanogens and their relatives. The second archaebacterial kingdom, named Crenarchaeota, contains the thermoacidophiles. Together, they form the domain Archaea. This new order was mainly based upon 16 S RNA sequence comparisons (38Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 221-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gupta R. Lanter J.M. Woese C.R. Science. 1983; 221: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The presence of a number of eucaryal features in archaea, including the relationship between the large subunits of the A-ATPases and eucaryal V-ATPases, has led to a closer grouping of archaea and eucarya than of archaea and eubacteria (37Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4574-4579Google Scholar). Whereas the origin of the F-ATPases is rooted in eubacteria, which evolved into the cell organelles mitochondria and chloroplasts, according to Nelson and Taiz (40Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and Gogarten et al. (41Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), the origin of V-ATPases is proposed to be related to archaebacteria. Nelson (42Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) proposed that evolution of the V-ATPases to become exclusively proton pumps is related to the duplication of their gene encoding the proteolipid. Comparing the operon structure of the E. hirae V-ATPase gene with the Haloferax ATPase operon, we were able to confirm the proposed relationship concerning the A1 and V1 parts of archaeal and vacuolar ATPases. Yet, the membrane-embedded proteolipid seems to be more closely related to the respective protein of F-ATPases, as shown by its size and N-terminal sequence. It has been proposed that the gene clusters for the catalytic portion of the ATPases initially have evolved separately (for review, see Ref. 42Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As an example for separated operons, the gene clusters of R. rubrum are shown in Fig. 9. The split between the operons is between the δ- and β-subunits. The H. volcanii gene cluster ends with atpD, encoding the δ-homolog subunit D. The same position can be observed for the gene encoding the δ-subunit of S. acidocaldarius, although the arrangement of the genes is different from that of Haloferax Work to obtain more information about the second ATPase gene cluster that codes for the A0 part of the Haloferax ATPase is in progress. Protein sequencing was performed by D. Kienzle (Forschungszentrum Jülich). We thank Dr. Jörg Soppa (Max-Planck-Institute Martinsried) for the generous gift of H. volcanii strain WR 340 and for help. We thank Dr. David Mozley and Martina Kroth for critical reading of the manuscript and for linguistic corrections."

https://openalex.org/W2078845350,"The active site topologies of neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS) nitric-oxide synthases heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli have been examined using three aryldiazene (Ar-N=NH) probes. The topological information derives from (a) the rate and extent of aryl-iron complex formation in the presence and absence of tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), Ca2+-dependent calmodulin (CaM), and L-arginine, and (b) the N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX regioisomer ratios obtained upon migration of the phenyl of the phenyl-iron complex to the heme nitrogen atoms. The N-phenylprotoporphyrin ratios indicate that the three NOS isoforms have related active site topologies with unencumbered space above all four pyrrole rings but particularly above pyrrole ring D. H4B binds directly above the heme pyrrole ring D or causes a conformational change that constricts that region, because H4B markedly decreases phenyl migration to pyrrole ring D. Small CaM-dependent changes in the nNOS N-phenylporphyrin isomer pattern are consistent with a conformational link between the CaM and heme sites in this protein. The ceiling height directly above the heme iron atom differs among the isoforms and is lower than in the P450 enzymes because only nNOS and iNOS react with 2-naphthyldiazene, and none of the isoforms reacts with p-biphenyldiazene. L-Arg blocks access to the heme iron atom in all three NOS isoforms and nearly suppresses the phenyldiazene reaction. The data indicate that topological differences, including differences in the size of the active site, are superimposed on the structural similarities among the NOS active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2032091471,"Abstract In an attempt to establish the stoichiometry of phosphorylation in the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles, phosphorylation by ATP (or Pi) or labeling by fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) was performed with the SR vesicles under the conditions in which almost all the phosphorylation sites or FITC binding sites are phosphorylated or labeled. The resulting vesicles were solubilized in lithium dodecyl sulfate and then the Ca2+-ATPase was purified by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. Peptide mapping and sequencing of the tryptic digest of the purified enzyme showed that Lys-515 of the Ca2+-ATPase was exclusively labeled with FITC, in agreement with the previously reported findings. The content of the phosphoenzyme from ATP (4.57 nmol/mg of Ca2+-ATPase protein) or from Pi (4.94 nmol/mg of Ca2+-ATPase protein) in the purified enzyme was approximately half the content of the FITC binding site (8.17-8.25 nmol/mg of Ca2+-ATPase protein) and also half the content of the Ca2+-ATPase molecule (9.06 nmol/mg of Ca2+-ATPase protein) calculated from its molecular mass (110,331 Da). These results show that there is one specific FITC binding site per molecule of the Ca2+-ATPase (in agreement with the previously reported findings) and that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation to FITC binding is approximately 0.5:1.0. All the above findings lead to the conclusion that only half of the Ca2+-ATPase molecules present in the SR vesicles can be phosphorylated. FITC binding completely inhibited the ATP-induced phosphorylation before the binding reached its maximum level. This finding indicates that FITC preferentially binds to a part of the Ca2+-ATPase molecules and that this binding is primarily responsible for the inhibition of phosphorylation, suggesting an intermolecular ATPase-ATPase interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1505068995,"Combinatorial phage display peptide libraries are routinely used to map epitopes of specific monoclonal antibodies. In this study we illustrate that these libraries can be used in the analysis of protein structure. By screening libraries at low stringency, a collection of phages can be obtained. These are characterized by the fact that they are recognized by a given monoclonal antibody yet with various affinities. Comparing the random peptides of these phages indicates the common essential residues necessary for antibody recognition. Aligning the inserts based on the detected homology has revealed structural motifs that correspond to secondary protein structures. The envelope protein of HIV-1 has been studied using this approach. A combinatorial phage display library containing a 20 mer random peptide in protein III of the filamentous phage fd-tet has been used to analyze two different monoclonal antibodies directed against gp120. Our results provide experimental evidence that indicate that the C1 domain of gp120 contains an alpha helix."
https://openalex.org/W2066247271,"Abstract During kinetic studies of mutant rat Na,K-ATPases, we identified a spontaneous mutation in the first cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helices 2 and 3 (H2-H3 loop) which results in a functional enzyme with distinct Na,K-ATPase kinetics. The mutant cDNA contained a single G950 to A substitution, which resulted in the replacement of glutamate at 233 with a lysine (E233K). E233K and α1 cDNAs were transfected into HeLa cells and their kinetic behavior was compared. Transport studies carried out under physiological conditions with intact cells indicate that the E233K mutant and α1 have similar apparent affinities for cytoplasmic Na+ and extracellular K+. In contrast, distinct kinetic properties are observed when ATPase activity is assayed under conditions (low ATP concentration) in which the K+ deocclusion pathway of the reaction is rate-limiting. At 1 μM ATP K+ inhibits Na+-ATPase of α1, but activates Na+-ATPase of E233K. This distinctive behavior of E233K is due to its faster rate of formation of dephosphoenzyme (E1) from K+-occluded enzyme (E2(K)), as well as 6-fold higher affinity for ATP at the low affinity ATP binding site. A lower ratio of Vmax to maximal level of phosphoenzyme indicates that E233K has a lower catalytic turnover than α1. These distinct kinetics of E233K suggest a shift in its E1/E2 conformational equilibrium toward E1. Furthermore, the importance of the H2-H3 loop in coupling conformational changes to ATP hydrolysis is underscored by a marked (2 orders of magnitude) reduction in vanadate sensitivity effected by this Glu233 → Lys mutation."

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the various mutants of HIV protease to inhibitors was determined for a battery of compounds. With the exception of Lin et al. (23Lin Y. Lin X. Hong L. Foundling S. Heinrikson R.L. Thaisrivongs S. Leelamanit W. Raterman D. Shah M. Dunn B.M. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the effects of the mutations on the catalytic efficiency of HIV protease were measured for only one synthetic substrate, although the choice of substrate varied among investigators. Relying on a single substrate to characterize the efficiency of HIV protease mutants has been questioned. Gulnik et al. (22Gulnik S.V. Suvorov L.I. Liu B. Yu B. Anderson B. Mitsuiya H. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9282-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) point out that, “while inhibition constants should not depend on the substrate, kcat/Km ratios do … Thus future studies should focus on a panel of substrates that represent all the natural HIV (protease) cleavage sites in the Gag-Pol polyproteins.” At least eight obligatory cleavages of the Gag-Pol polyprotein by HIV protease have been identified for viable maturation of viral particles (24Darke P.L. Nutt R.F. Brady S.F. Garsky V.M. Ciccarone T.M. Leu C.T. Lumma P.K. Freidinger R.M. Veber D.F. Sigal I.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and there is considerable evidence that the order of the eight cleavages is not random. In vitro studies clearly show time-dependent, sequential formation and disappearance of the various intermediates during processing of the Gag-Pol polyprotein by HIV protease (25Gowda S.D. Stein B.S. Engleman E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8459-8462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kaplan A.H. Swanstrom R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1994; 68: 8017-8027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that this sequential processing is more than just an in vitro phenomenon. Indeed, Stewart and Vogt (29Stewart L. Vogt V.M. Virology. 1994; 204: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have proposed that “the order of cleavages is critically important in virus maturation.” For the avian retrovirus the “proper proteolytic maturation of the ALV Gag-Pol polyprotein and the consequent activation of reverse transcriptase … requires a specific sequence of cleavages that is dictated by the microenvironment of the budding virus particle.” Sequential processing is characteristic of the maturation of picornaviruses as well. Shih and Shih (30Shih C.Y. Shih D.S. Virology. 1981; 40: 942-945Crossref Google Scholar) report that the proteolytic cleavage of the encephalomyocarditis virus capsid protein precursor occurs in a defined, stepwise manner. The timing of the processing events is also crucial. Kageyama et al. (2Kageyama S. Hoekzema D.T. Murakawa Y. Kojima E. Shirasaka T. Kempf D.J. Norbeck D.W. Erickson J. Mitsuya H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that the temporary presence of an HIV protease inhibitor resulted in irreversible damage to the infectivity of HIV-1 in vitro It is important to point out that in this study the number of virions produced in the presence of the inhibitor was the same as produced in its absence. Even the viral RNA content was the same as the control. In addition, the authors could reduce the number of infectious particles in cell culture 10-fold with an inhibitor concentration that had little or no effect on the production of p24 antigen relative to a drug-free control. Similarly, Kaplan et al. (3Kaplan A.H. Zack J.A. Knigge M. Paul D.A. Kempf D.J. Norbeck D.W. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4050-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that submicromolar concentrations of a protease inhibitor profoundly reduced the number of infectious particles without noticeably affecting the production of p24 antigen. A consideration of these results and others led to the following hypothesis. The literature to date implies a finely tuned, ordered sequence of events leading to viable HIV replication and maturation. While HIV protease can cleave its viral proteins in a variety of ways, depending on the conditions, it is proposed that only a specific, ordered sequence of Gag-Pol polyprotein processing leads to infectious virions. Furthermore, the ordered processing sequence is kinetically equivalent to a series of consecutive enzyme catalyzed reactions depicted below, where PR is protease. Kuchel et al. (31Kuchel P.W. Nichol L.W. Jeffrey P.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1974; 48: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) developed the theoretical basis for the analysis of the kinetics of consecutive enzyme catalyzed reactions involving single substrates, leading to the formation of the final product Sp. The procedure of Kuchel et al. assumes a steady state of enzyme-substrate complexes but not of intermediate reactants. The overall catalytic efficiency of the ordered sequence is represented by the rate of change in the molar concentration of the final cleavage product Sp (Equation 1). Kuchel et al. showed that the concentration of each species Sj is a continuous and differentiable function of t and may be expressed as a power series by means of a Maclaurin polynomial when expansion is made about the origin (t = 0, [Sj]t = [Sj]0). The production of Sp at any time t, then, is given by Equation 2. At t = 0, [Sp]0 = 0. The expression for the first derivative of [Sp]0 is directly obtained from Equation 1, while those for higher order derivatives are evaluated by successive differentiation with respect to time. The differentiation is facilitated by noting that [Sj]0 = 0 for all j ≠ 1, and at t = 0, [S1]0 is equal to the concentration of the first substrate at the beginning of the first proteolytic processing event. Obtaining the higher order coefficients in Equation 2 turns out to be a simple matter of successive substitution. The derivation of the next two higher order derivatives demonstrates the process. Kuchel et al. showed that in general the first non-zero term for the expansion of [Sp]t is given by Equation 5. It is clear from the term ∏j = 2p(Vj − 1/Kj − 1) of Equation 5 that [Sp]t depends on the outcome of all the processing steps of the ordered sequence. Equation 6 can be used to compare the overall catalytic efficiency of the mutant proteases to the wild type enzyme. To do this it is necessary to compute the ratio, shown in Equation 6. The higher order terms greater than (p − 1) were not included in Equation 5 to simplify the next steps. Substituting the appropriate versions of Equation 5 into Equation 6 results in Equation 7. Let which gives Equation 9. Tang and Hartsuck (21Tang J. Hartsuck J.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have argued that the effective concentrations of HIV substrates are below their Km values. Whether or not this is true, the factor on the right can be dropped giving Equation 10 for HIV protease. To a first approximation, 2Equation 10a is the general expression of Equation 10 that includes the higher order terms. However, using the data of Lin et al. (23Lin Y. Lin X. Hong L. Foundling S. Heinrikson R.L. Thaisrivongs S. Leelamanit W. Raterman D. Shah M. Dunn B.M. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as a test demonstrated that the higher order terms can be deleted, resulting in the simpler Equation 10 as a good approximation. Equation 10 measures the overall efficiency of mutant HIV protease relative to the wild type enzyme. The overall efficiency is the product of the relative efficiencies of the mutant enzyme versus the wild type for all eight obligatory cleavages. To assess the viability of HIV protease in the presence of an inhibitor it is necessary to compute Adjusting Equation 5 for the presence of competitive inhibitor yields Equation 12. Substituting Equations 5 and 12 into Equation 11 gives Equation 13. This simplifies to the equation below. If, as is likely, and Tang and Hartsuck (21Tang J. Hartsuck J.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are right, Equation 14 can be approximated by Equation 15 for HIV protease. Equation 15 measures the overall reduction in catalytic efficiency of HIV protease in the presence of an inhibitor. It is important to note that the efficiency of overall proteolytic processing is inversely proportional to the eighth power of (1 + [I]/Ki). For [I] ≠ 0, overall catalytic efficiency falls off rapidly with increasing levels of inhibitor. Finally, to compare the viability of the mutant HIV protease in the presence of inhibitor to the uninhibited wild type enzyme it is necessary to compute Equation 16. The usual manipulations give Equation 17. Employing the same rationale used to simplify Eqaution 14, Equation 17 reduces to Equation 18 for HIV protease. Equation 18 expresses the overall catalytic efficiency of mutant HIV protease in the presence of inhibitor as compared with the uninhibited wild type enzyme. In the absence of inhibitor, Equation 18 reduces to Equation 10. For any inhibited protease compared with itself, Equation 18 reduces to Equation 15. Therefore, Equation 18 is sufficient to characterize the overall catalytic efficiency of mutant or wild type HIV proteases in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Kaplan et al. (3Kaplan A.H. Zack J.A. Knigge M. Paul D.A. Kempf D.J. Norbeck D.W. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4050-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that partial inhibition of HIV proteolytic activity results in a profound reduction in the number of infectious particles, disproportionate to the effect of the inhibitor on the viral protease itself. At 100 nM, the Abbott HIV protease inhibitor A77003 reduced the viral titer 5-fold. However, a 3-fold increase in inhibitor concentration (330 nM) decreased the viral titer 80-100-fold. Surprisingly, at the higher inhibitor concentration there was only modest reduction of Gag precursor processing as determined by Western blot analysis of certain of the intermediates. If we assume that the number of infectious units/ml (Uj) is proportional to the overall proteolytic processing of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, then we obtain Equation 19, which is just another form of Equation 15. Equation 19 should describe the effects of HIV protease inhibitors on the production of infectious viral particles in vitro Since the concentration of inhibitor that reaches the HIV protease in cell culture is unknown but likely to be substantially less than that in the culture media, Ki (Ki = 84 pM; Ref. 32Hosur M.V. Bhat T.N. Kempf D.J. Baldwin E.T. Liu B. Gulnik S. Wideburg N.E. Norbeck D.W. Appelt K. Erickson J.W. J. Am. Chem.

Open table in a new tab Equation 20 can be used to calculate the EC50 value of the inhibitor for in vitro cell culture. For Ki(app) = 466 nM (Table I), EC50 = 42 nM. This value compares with the EC50 = 30-150 nM reported by Kempf et al. (33Kempf D.J. Marsh K.C. Paul D.A. Knigge M.F. Norbeck D.W. Kohlbrenner W.E. Codacovi L. Vasavanonda S. Bryant P. Wang X.C.

The inverse eighth power dependence on (1 + [I]/Ki) for the overall catalytic activity of HIV protease is responsible for the EC50 < Ki(app) and the remarkably steep decline in the production of infectious virions in the presence of increasing levels of A77003. This result is general and has implications for extending the inhibitor approach to other viral targets. The individual γj terms of Equation 18 are unknown for the mutant HIV proteases except for a few synthetic substrates (23Lin Y. Lin X. Hong L. Foundling S. Heinrikson R.L. Thaisrivongs S. Leelamanit W. Raterman D. Shah M. Dunn B.M. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the geometric mean of the product of the eight γj terms can be used as a convenient substitute in the absence of the experimental values. The minimum overall catalytic efficiency of HIV protease for viable viral maturation has been estimated at between 0.25 and 0.02 times the wild type activity (6Babé L.M. Rosé J. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Rosé J.R. Babé L.M. Craik C.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tang J. Hartsuck J.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Gulnik S.V. Suvorov L.I. Liu B. Yu B. Anderson B. Mitsuiya H. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9282-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Substituting 0.25-0.02 and the geometric mean of the γj terms into Equation 18 gives the inequality, Equation 21, which determines the lower limit of HIV protease viability. In the absence of inhibitor, Equation 21 gives γ < 0.84-0.61. If one is comparing the activity of the same enzyme in the presence and absence of inhibitor, then γ = 1 and the inequality in Equation 21 becomes [I] > 0.19-0.63Ki. Thus for the wild type HIV protease, inhibitor levels of only 20-60% of Ki (assuming 100% inhibitor bioavailability) are sufficient to render the virus nonviable. Lin et al. (23Lin Y. Lin X. Hong L. Foundling S. Heinrikson R.L. Thaisrivongs S. Leelamanit W. Raterman D. Shah M. Dunn B.M. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are among only a few authors to report γj for j > 1, and these are all for synthetic substrates. An analysis of their data shows that most of the γj values < 0.61, the minimum mean value for the most stringent condition at the 0.02 level of wild type activity. Lin et al. report the V82D mutant of HIV protease was 5545 times less sensitive to a particular inhibitor than the wild type enzyme. However, γ1 for this mutant was equal to 0.036, which is well below the 0.61 level. When the V82D mutant was compared with a battery of synthetic substrates, its overall catalytic efficiency was over a million-fold (i.e.j = 18γj < 10−6) lower than the wild type enzyme for the same substrates. In fact, all the mutants, with two exceptions, had j = 18γj << 0.02 and, consequently, would not be expected to lead to viable virus in vivo The greater activity of the G48Y mutant protease prompted Lin et al. to wonder “why the wild type HIV-1 does not select for a higher catalytic activity with a larger side chain at position 48.” However, others have shown that elevations in the overall proteolytic activity of HIV protease above wild type levels are as deleterious to the virus as substantial reductions in activity (9Mergener K. Fäcke M. Welker R. Brinkmann V. Gelderblom H.R. Kräusslich H.G. Virology. 1992; 186: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Kräusslich H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 35Kräusslich H.-G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent 10-fold higher activity toward one substrate referred to by the authors is a mere shadow of the overall gain in catalytic efficiency of the G48Y mutant, i.e.j = 18γj > 105, more than sufficient to explain the absence of this phenotype in nature. Fig. 1 is a graphical representation of Equation 21, where the minimum overall catalytic activity of HIV protease is set to 0.02 times that of the uninhibited wild type enzyme. Points above the line represent viable protease, whereas points below the line do not. A striking feature of the graph is the very narrow region of viability. Under no conditions is HIV viable for γ < 0.61 or for [I] > 0.63Ki. Non-saturating levels of inhibitor are sufficient to render mutant as well as wild type HIV nonviable. Since virtually all mutant HIV proteases have γj < 1, then even lower levels of protease inhibitors are sufficient to prevent mutant viral maturation. A combination of γ < 1 and the inverse eighth power dependence on (1 + [I]/Ki(app)) offsets the inhibitor resistance the mutant enzymes may acquire. It is instructive to examine the consequence to inhibition of mutations that result in overall catalytic efficiencies between 0.02 and 1.0 of the wild type HIV protease. If the overall catalytic efficiency of a mutant protease is twice the minimum level for viability, an inhibitor concentration greater than 9% of the Ki(m) value (assuming 100% inhibitor bioavailability) is sufficient to render the mutant virus nonviable. If, for this mutant protease, Ki(m) = 10Ki(w), the concentration of inhibitor needed for nonviability is only 0.9Ki(w), still well below the saturation level for even the wild type enzyme. If the mutant enzyme is lucky enough to achieve a 100-fold elevation in Ki over the wild type, then [I] > 9Ki(w) is sufficient for nonviability. Even more dramatic, if the mutant protease has 40 times (i.e. γ8 = 0.80, γ = 0.97) the minimum viable activity of the wild type at the 0.02 level, the amount of inhibitor needed for nonviability is still only 58% of Ki(m). In this case, the mutant protease activity is virtually equivalent to the wild type and [I] > 5.8Ki(w) results in nonviability for Ki(m) = 10Ki(w). To put these numbers into perspective, a typical dosing level of HIV protease inhibitor (Mr≈ 600) for an AIDS patient is around 600 mg, three times a day (36James J.S. AIDS Treatment News. 1995; 235: 8-9Google Scholar). A low oral uptake of 6% translates roughly to 800 nM inhibitor in a 70-kg patient. The Ki(w) values for the inhibitors range from nanomolar to picomolar. The upper limit of the daily dose then is 800-800,000 times the Ki(w) values. The pharmacokinetic properties of the Roche inhibitor Ro 31-8959 have been reported. Patients receiving 1.8 g/day of the inhibitor had mean plasma concentrations around 44 nM (37Vella S. AIDS. 1994; 8: S25-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, even higher doses of Ro 31-8959 have been administered (14Schapiro J.M. Winters M.A. Stewart F. Efron B. Norris J. Kozal M.J. Merigan T.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1996; 124: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For patients receiving either 3.6 or 7.2 g of inhibitor per day, the mean plasma levels were 116 or 560 nM, respectively. As discussed earlier, the actual concentration of inhibitor that reaches the HIV protease is likely substantially less. So far only one inhibitor-resistant mutant (K45E) of HIV protease (23Lin Y. Lin X. Hong L. Foundling S. Heinrikson R.L. Thaisrivongs S. Leelamanit W. Raterman D. Shah M. Dunn B.M. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has been reported that comes anywhere near the minimum level of overall catalytic activity (j = 18γj = 0.13) necessary for viral viability. Nonetheless, a virus with this mutation is still sensitive to the HIV protease inhibitors because of the inverse eighth power dependence on (1 + [I]/Ki). For example, The inhibitor U85548 has Ki = 3 nM for wild type and 31 nM for the K45E mutant (23Lin Y. Lin X. Hong L. Foundling S. Heinrikson R.L. Thaisrivongs S. Leelamanit W. Raterman D. Shah M. Dunn B.M. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a 10-fold increase. Using the most optimistic conditions for inhibition, [I] = 800 nM and assuming that Ki(app) = 100Ki(m), gives Equation 22, which is just at the limit of viability. It is important to point out that a number of approximations and assumptions were introduced into this analysis of consecutive cleavages in order to make the equations tractable. For instance, the Maclaurin poly"
