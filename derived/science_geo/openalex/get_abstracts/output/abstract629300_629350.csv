https://openalex.org/W3105163550,"Optical frequency combs consist of equally spaced discrete optical frequency components and are essential tools for optical communications and for precision metrology, timing and spectroscopy. To date, wide-spanning combs are most often generated by mode-locked lasers or dispersion-engineered resonators with third-order Kerr nonlinearity. An alternative comb generation method uses electro-optic (EO) phase modulation in a resonator with strong second-order nonlinearity, resulting in combs with excellent stability and controllability. Previous EO combs, however, have been limited to narrow widths by a weak EO interaction strength and a lack of dispersion engineering in free-space systems. In this work, we overcome these limitations by realizing an integrated EO comb generator in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform that features a large electro-optic response, ultra-low optical loss and highly co-localized microwave and optical felds, while enabling dispersion engineering. Our measured EO frequency comb spans more than the entire telecommunications L-band (over 900 comb lines spaced at ~ 10 GHz), and we show that future dispersion engineering can enable octave-spanning combs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high tolerance of our comb generator to modulation frequency detuning, with frequency spacing finely controllable over seven orders of magnitude (10 Hz to 100 MHz), and utilize this feature to generate dual frequency combs in a single resonator. Our results show that integrated EO comb generators, capable of generating wide and stable comb spectra, are a powerful complement to integrated Kerr combs, enabling applications ranging from spectroscopy to optical communications."
https://openalex.org/W2951331911,"Standardized benchmarking approaches are required to assess the accuracy of variants called from sequence data. Although variant-calling tools and the metrics used to assess their performance continue to improve, important challenges remain. Here, as part of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), we present a benchmarking framework for variant calling. We provide guidance on how to match variant calls with different representations, define standard performance metrics, and stratify performance by variant type and genome context. We describe limitations of high-confidence calls and regions that can be used as truth sets (for example, single-nucleotide variant concordance of two methods is 99.7% inside versus 76.5% outside high-confidence regions). Our web-based app enables comparison of variant calls against truth sets to obtain a standardized performance report. Our approach has been piloted in the PrecisionFDA variant-calling challenges to identify the best-in-class variant-calling methods within high-confidence regions. Finally, we recommend a set of best practices for using our tools and evaluating the results."
https://openalex.org/W2921807317,"The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) coordinates an array of fundamental behaviors, including sleeping, waking, feeding, stress and motivated behavior. The wide spectrum of functions ascribed to the LHA may be explained by a heterogeneous population of neurons, the full diversity of which is poorly understood. We employed a droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing approach to develop a comprehensive census of molecularly distinct cell types in the mouse LHA. Neuronal populations were classified based on fast neurotransmitter phenotype and expression of neuropeptides, transcription factors and synaptic proteins, among other gene categories. We define 15 distinct populations of glutamatergic neurons and 15 of GABAergic neurons, including known and novel cell types. We further characterize a novel population of somatostatin-expressing neurons through anatomical and behavioral approaches, identifying a role for these neurons in specific forms of innate locomotor behavior. This study lays the groundwork for better understanding the circuit-level underpinnings of LHA function."
https://openalex.org/W2921570235,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and accounts for >2 million deaths annually in China1,2. Ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) account for an equal number of deaths in China, despite a fourfold greater incidence of IS1,2. Stroke incidence and ICH proportion are higher in China than in Western populations3-5, despite having a lower mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. Observational studies reported weaker positive associations of LDL-C with IS than with coronary heart disease (CHD)6,7, but LDL-C-lowering trials demonstrated similar risk reductions for IS and CHD8-10. Mendelian randomization studies of LDL-C and IS have reported conflicting results11-13, and concerns about the excess risks of ICH associated with lowering LDL-C14,15 may have prevented the more widespread use of statins in China. We examined the associations of biochemically measured lipids with stroke in a nested case-control study in the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) and compared the risks for both stroke types associated with equivalent differences in LDL-C in Mendelian randomization analyses. The results demonstrated positive associations of LDL-C with IS and equally strong inverse associations with ICH, which were confirmed by genetic analyses and LDL-C-lowering trials. Lowering LDL-C is still likely to have net benefit for the prevention of overall stroke and cardiovascular disease in China."

https://openalex.org/W2953047957,"Widespread linkage disequilibrium and incomplete annotation of cell-to-cell state variation represent substantial challenges to elucidating mechanisms of trait-associated genetic variation. Here we perform genetic fine-mapping for blood cell traits in the UK Biobank to identify putative causal variants. These variants are enriched in genes encoding proteins in trait-relevant biological pathways and in accessible chromatin of hematopoietic progenitors. For regulatory variants, we explore patterns of developmental enhancer activity, predict molecular mechanisms, and identify likely target genes. In several instances, we localize multiple independent variants to the same regulatory element or gene. We further observe that variants with pleiotropic effects preferentially act in common progenitor populations to direct the production of distinct lineages. Finally, we leverage fine-mapped variants in conjunction with continuous epigenomic annotations to identify trait-cell type enrichments within closely related populations and in single cells. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for single-variant and single-cell analyses of genetic associations."
https://openalex.org/W2921633050,"Malformations of the human cortex represent a major cause of disability1. Mouse models with mutations in known causal genes only partially recapitulate the phenotypes and are therefore not unlimitedly suited for understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for these conditions2. Here we study periventricular heterotopia (PH) by analyzing cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients with mutations in the cadherin receptor-ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4 or from isogenic knockout (KO) lines1,3. Our results show that human cerebral organoids reproduce the cortical heterotopia associated with PH. Mutations in DCHS1 and FAT4 or knockdown of their expression causes changes in the morphology of neural progenitor cells and result in defective neuronal migration dynamics only in a subset of neurons. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data reveal a subpopulation of mutant neurons with dysregulated genes involved in axon guidance, neuronal migration and patterning. We suggest that defective neural progenitor cell (NPC) morphology and an altered navigation system in a subset of neurons underlie this form of PH."
https://openalex.org/W2953100281,"The interactions between neocortical areas are fluid and state-dependent, but how individual neurons couple to cortex-wide network dynamics remains poorly understood. We correlated the spiking of neurons in primary visual (V1) and retrosplenial (RSP) cortex to activity across dorsal cortex, recorded simultaneously by widefield calcium imaging. Neurons were correlated with distinct and reproducible patterns of activity across the cortical surface; while some fired predominantly with their local area, others coupled to activity in distal areas. The extent of distal coupling was predicted by how strongly neurons correlated with the local network. Changes in brain state triggered by locomotion strengthened affiliations of V1 neurons with higher visual and motor areas, while strengthening distal affiliations of RSP neurons with sensory cortices. Thus, the diverse coupling of individual neurons to cortex-wide activity patterns is restructured by running in an area-specific manner, resulting in a shift in the mode of cortical processing during locomotion."

https://openalex.org/W2922523714,"Perturbations to mammalian switch/sucrose non-fermentable (mSWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes have been widely implicated as driving events in cancer1. One such perturbation is the dual loss of the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 ATPase subunits in small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT)2-5, SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcomas6 and dedifferentiated endometrial carcinomas7. However, the consequences of dual ATPase subunit loss on mSWI/SNF complex subunit composition, chromatin targeting, DNA accessibility and gene expression remain unknown. Here we identify an ATPase module of subunits that is required for functional specification of the Brahma-related gene-associated factor (BAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) mSWI/SNF family subcomplexes. Using SMARCA4/2 ATPase mutant variants, we define the catalytic activity-dependent and catalytic activity-independent contributions of the ATPase module to the targeting of BAF and PBAF complexes on chromatin genome-wide. Finally, by linking distinct mSWI/SNF complex target sites to tumor-suppressive gene expression programs, we clarify the transcriptional consequences of SMARCA4/2 dual loss in SCCOHT."
https://openalex.org/W2950160466,"Hippocampus, granular retrosplenial cortex (RSCg), and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) interact to mediate diverse cognitive functions. To identify cellular mechanisms underlying hippocampo-thalamo-retrosplenial interactions, we investigated the potential circuit suggested by projections to RSCg layer 1 (L1) from GABAergic CA1 neurons and ATN. We find that CA1→RSCg projections stem from GABAergic neurons with a distinct morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular profile. Their long-range axons inhibit L5 pyramidal neurons in RSCg via potent synapses onto apical tuft dendrites in L1. These inhibitory inputs intercept L1-targeting thalamocortical excitatory inputs from ATN to coregulate RSCg activity. Subicular axons, in contrast, excite proximal dendrites in deeper layers. Short-term plasticity differs at each connection. Chemogenetically abrogating CA1→RSCg or ATN→RSCg connections oppositely affects the encoding of contextual fear memory. Our findings establish retrosplenial-projecting CA1 neurons as a distinct class of long-range dendrite-targeting GABAergic neuron and delineate an unusual cortical circuit specialized for integrating long-range inhibition and thalamocortical excitation."
https://openalex.org/W2920862727,"Mitochondrial function has been implicated and studied in numerous complex age-related diseases. Understanding the potential role of mitochondria in disease pathophysiology is of importance due to the rise in prevalence of complex age-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These two diseases specifically share common pathophysiological characteristics which potentially point to a common root cause or factors for disease exacerbation. Studying the shared phenomena in Mexican Americans is of particular importance due to the disproportionate prevalence of both T2D and AD in this population. Here, we assessed the potential role of mitochondria in T2D and cognitive impairment (CI) in a Mexican American cohort by analyzing blood-based indices of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNACN) and cell-free mitochondrial DNA (CFmtDNA). These mitochondrial metrics were also analyzed for correlation with relevant neuropsychological variables and physiological data collected as indicators of disease and/or disease progression. We found mtDNACN to be significantly decreased in individuals with CI, while CFmtDNA was significantly elevated in T2D; further, CFmtDNA elevation was significantly exacerbated in individuals with both diseases. MtDNACN was found to negatively correlate with age and fatty acid binding protein concentration, while positively correlating with CFmtDNA as well as CERAD total recall score. Candidate gene SNP-set analysis was performed on genes previously implicated in maintenance and control of mitochondrial dynamics to determine if nuclear variants may account for variability in mtDNACN. The results point to a single significant locus, in the LRRK2/MUC19 region, encoding leucine rich repeat kinase 2 and mucin 19. This locus has been previously implicated in Parkinson's disease, among others; rs7302859 was the driver SNP. These combined findings further indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction (as assessed by proxy via mtDNACN) is intimately linked to both T2D and CI phenotypes as well as aging."
https://openalex.org/W2953336006,"We describe three optical tags, ArrayG, ArrayD and ArrayG/N, for intracellular tracking of single molecules over milliseconds to hours. ArrayG is a fluorogenic tag composed of a green fluorescent protein-nanobody array and monomeric wild-type green fluorescent protein binders that are initially dim but brighten ~26-fold on binding with the array. By balancing the rates of binder production, photobleaching and stochastic binder exchange, we achieve temporally unlimited tracking of single molecules. High-speed tracking of ArrayG-tagged kinesins and integrins for thousands of frames reveals novel dynamical features. Tracking of single histones at 0.5 Hz for >1 hour with the import competent ArrayG/N tag shows that chromosomal loci behave as Rouse polymers with visco-elastic memory and exhibit a non-Gaussian displacement distribution. ArrayD, based on a dihydrofolate reductase nanobody array and dihydrofolate reductase-fluorophore binder, enables dual-color imaging. The arrays combine brightness, fluorogenicity, fluorescence replenishment and extended fluorophore choice, opening new avenues for tracking single molecules in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2921471402,"Background HIV and TB programs have rapidly scaled-up over the past decade in Sub-Saharan Africa and uninterrupted supplies of those medicines are critical to their success. However, estimates of stock-outs are largely unknown. This survey aimed to estimate the extent of stock-outs of antiretroviral and TB medicines in public health facilities across South Africa, which has the world’s largest antiretroviral treatment (ART) program and a rising multidrug-resistant TB epidemic. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional telephonic survey (October—December 2015) of public health facilities. Facilities were asked about the prevalence of stock-outs on the day of the survey and in the preceding three months, their duration and impact. Results Nationwide, of 3547 eligible health facilities, 79% (2804) could be reached telephonically. 88% (2463) participated and 4% (93) were excluded as they did not provide ART or TB treatment. Of the 2370 included facilities, 20% (485) reported a stock-out of at least 1 ARV and/or TB-related medicine on the day of contact and 36% (864) during the three months prior to contact, ranging from 74% (163/220) of health facilities in Mpumalanga to 12% (32/261) in the Western Cape province. These 864 facilities reported 1475 individual stock-outs, with one to fourteen different medicines out of stock per facility. Information on impact was provided in 98% (1449/1475) of stock-outs: 25% (366) resulted in a high impact outcome, where patients left the facility without medicine or were provided with an incomplete regimen. Of the 757 stock-outs that were resolved 70% (527) lasted longer than one month. Interpretation There was a high prevalence of stock-outs nationwide. Large interprovincial differences in stock-out occurrence, duration, and impact suggest differences in provincial ability to prevent, mitigate and cope within the same framework. End-user monitoring of the supply chain by patients and civil society has the potential to increase transparency and complement public sector monitoring systems."
https://openalex.org/W2921301628,"Currently about 2 billion adults globally are estimated to be overweight and ~13% of them are obese. High fat diet (HFD) is one of the major contributing factor to obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Recent findings on the role of HFD in inducing abnormalities in neurocognition and susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease are highly intriguing. Since fundamental molecular pathways are often conserved across species, studies involving Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involving human disease. In order to study some of such mechanisms in the central nervous system as well in the rest of the body, we investigated the effect of HFD on the transcriptome in the heads and bodies of male and female flies kept on either HFD or regular diet (RD). Using comprehensive genomic analyses which include high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, pathway enrichment and gene network analyses, we found that HFD induces a number of responses that are sexually dimorphic in nature. There was a robust transcriptional response consisting of a downregulation of stress-related genes in the heads and glycoside hydrolase activity genes in the bodies of males. In the females, the HFD led to an increased transcriptional change in lipid metabolism. A strong correlation also existed between the takeout gene and hyperphagic behavior in both males and females. We conclude that a) HFD induces a differential transcriptional response between males and females, in heads and bodies and b) the non-dimorphic transcriptional response that we identified was associated with hyperphagia. Therefore, our data on the transcriptional responses in flies to HFD provides potentially relevant information to human conditions including obesity."

The recent technological advancements in intelligent traveler information have a strong influence on the route choice behavior of drivers by enabling them to be more flexible in selecting their routes. Measuring traffic congestion in a city, understanding its spatial dispersion, and investigating whether the congestion patterns are stable (temporally, such as on a day-to-day basis) are critical to developing effective traffic management strategies. In this study, with the help of Google Maps API, we gather traffic speed data of 29 cities across the world over a 40-day period. We present generalized congestion and network stability metrics to compare congestion levels between these cities. We find that (a) traffic congestion is related to macroeconomic characteristics such as per capita income and population density of these cities, (b) congestion patterns are mostly stable on a day-to-day basis, and (c) the rate of spatial dispersion of congestion is smaller in congested cities, i.e. the spatial heterogeneity is less sensitive to increase in delays. This study compares the traffic conditions across global cities on a common datum using crowdsourced data which is becoming readily available for research purposes. This information can potentially assist practitioners to tailor macroscopic network congestion and reliability management policies. The comparison of different cities can also lead to benchmarking and standardization of the policies that have been used to date."
https://openalex.org/W2922368232,"Hypercholesterolemia is reported to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to promote breast cancer progression. ROS play an important role in tumor biology, and xanthine oxidase (XO) is an enzyme that generates ROS. The effects of febuxostat (FBX), an XO inhibitor, on breast cancer cell migration under LDL stimulation in vitro and metastasis of breast cancer associated with hypercholesterolemia in vivo were studied. In vitro, FBX significantly inhibited LDL-induced ROS production and cell migration. Treatment of small interfering RNA against XO was consistent with the findings of FBX treatment. In vivo, a significant increase of tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis was observed in a xenograft mouse model with 4T1 cells on a high cholesterol diet (HCD), both of which were markedly inhibited by FBX or allopurinol treatment. Moreover, ERK represented the main target-signaling pathway that was affected by FBX treatment in a xenograft mouse model on an HCD evaluated by NanoString nCounter analysis. Consistently, MEK/ERK inhibitors directly decreased the LDL-induced cell migration in vitro. In conclusion, FBX mitigates breast cancer cell migration and pulmonary metastasis in the hyperlipidemic condition, associated with decreased ROS generation and MAPK phosphorylation. The inhibition of ERK pathways is likely to underlie the XO inhibitor-mediated suppression of breast cancer cell migration.—Oh, S.-H., Choi, S.-Y., Choi, H.-J., Ryu, H.-M., Kim, Y.-J., Jung, H.-Y., Cho, J.-H., Kim, C.-D., Park, S.-H., Kwon, T.-H., Kim, Y.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2921319578,"Electroencephalogram monitoring during propofol (PRO) anesthesia typically features low-frequency oscillations, which may be involved with thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) modulation. TRN receives noradrenergic inputs from the locus coeruleus (LC). We hypothesized that specific noradrenergic connections in the TRN may contribute to the emergence from PRO anesthesia. Intranuclei norepinephrine (NE) injections (n = 10) and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) (n = 10) were used to investigate the role of noradrenergic inputs from the LC to the TRN during PRO anesthesia. Whole-cell recording in acute brain slice preparations was used to identify the type of adrenoceptor that regulates noradrenergic innervation in the TRN. An intracerebral injection of NE into the TRN delays arousal in mice recovering from PRO anesthesia (means ± sd; 486.6 ± 57.32 s for the NE injection group vs. 422.4 ± 48.19 s for the control group; P = 0.0143) and increases the cortical-δ (0.1-4 Hz, 25.4 ± 2.9 for the NE injection group vs. 21.0 ± 1.7 for the control group; P = 0.0094) oscillation. An intra-TRN injection of NE also decreased the EC50 of PRO-induced unconsciousness (57.05 ± 1.78 mg/kg for the NE injection group vs. 72.44 ± 3.23 mg/kg for the control group; P = 0.0096). Moreover, the activation of LC-noradrenergic nerve terminals in the TRN using DREADDs increased the recovery time [466.1 ± 44.57 s for the clozapine N-oxide (CNO) injection group vs. 426.1 ± 38.75 s for the control group; P = 0.0033], decreased the EC50 of PRO-induced unconsciousness (64.77 ± 3.40 mg/kg for the CNO injection group vs. 74.00 ± 2.08 mg/kg for the control group; P = 0.0081), and increased the cortical-δ oscillation during PRO anesthesia (23.29 ± 2.58 for the CNO injection group vs. 19.56 ± 1.9 for the control group; P = 0.0213). In addition, whole-cell recording revealed that NE augmented the inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the TRN neurons via the α1-adrenoceptor. Our data indicated that enhanced NE signaling at the noradrenergic terminals of the LC-TRN projection delays arousal from general anesthesia, which is likely mediated by the α1-adrenoceptor activation. Our findings open a door for further understanding of the functions of various LC targets in both anesthesia and arousal.-Zhang, Y., Fu, B., Liu, C., Yu, S., Luo, T., Zhang, L., Zhou, W., Yu, T.

https://openalex.org/W2922394295,"Agricultural sector plays a key role towards achieving healthier diets that are deemed critical for improving health and nutritional outcomes. To what extent the current food supply systems support healthy diets remains unknown. Using annual and nationally representative data on crop and livestock production in Ethiopia, we assess the national agricultural sector from a nutrition lens and its role in supporting healthy diets in the country. We do so by converting the agricultural production into energy and nutrients for the period of 2011-2015. These data show that the national food production has increased dramatically over the 5-year period to supply more than 3,000 calories per capita in 2015. Moreover, nutrient production gaps have substantially decreased (2011-15), but deficits in energy (5%), vitamin C (16%), and calcium (9%) production remained in 2015. However, this production growth-coming primarily from the cereal sector and at the expense of other food groups-led to a decrease in production diversity as reflected by a drop in the Shannon index between 2011 and 2015. Together these findings imply that the production increases in Ethiopia would need to be sustained to feed the rapidly growing population but more emphasis should be given to diversification to support healthy and nutritionally diversified diets."

This promising technology is useful for the production of a variety of recombinant proteins including, therapeutic proteins, vaccine antigens, native additives, and industrial enzymes. However, plants lack some of the important PTMs, including furin processing, which limits this system for the production of certain mammalian complex proteins of therapeutic value. Furin is a ubiquitous proprotein convertase that is involved in the processing (activation) of a wide variety of precursor proteins, including blood coagulation factors, cell surface receptors, hormones and growth factors, viral envelope glycoproteins, etc. and plays a critical regulatory role in a wide variety of cellular events. In this study, we engineered the human furin gene for expression in plants and demonstrated the production of a functional active recombinant truncated human furin in N. benthamiana plant. We demonstrate that plant produced human furin is highly active both in vivo and in vitro and specifically cleaved the tested target proteins, Factor IX (FIX) and Protective Antigen (PA83). We also demonstrate that both, enzymatic deglycosylation and proteolytic processing of target proteins can be achieved in vivo by co-expression of deglycosylating and furin cleavage enzymes in a single cell to produce deglycosylated and furin processed target proteins. It is highly expected that this strategy will have many potential applications in pharmaceutical industry and can be used to produce safe and affordable therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and vaccines using a plant expression system."

https://openalex.org/W2920810663,"Purpose The overall goal of the Saleema Initiative in Sudan is to promote long-term abandonment of female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM) through a contribution to changing social norms, attitudes, and intentions related to the practice. The initiative aims to create positive cultural associations with a girl remaining uncut, a new social norm. Saleema hypothesizes that branding the alternative to FGM (abandonment) will promote social norms change. In 2014, the lead author designed a monitoring and evaluation framework for Saleema in partnership with UNICEF, the National Council for Child Welfare (NCCW), and local organizations. Methods The Saleema evaluation aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign in reducing pro-FGM social norms. A quasi-experimental design controlled for dosage of campaign messages delivered across the 18 states in Sudan to measure a dose-response effect. We operationalized social norms through a 4-item scale validated in previous research. Results This paper reports on quantitative evaluation findings based on data gathered in from 2015–2017 and focuses on the dose-response relationship between Saleema exposure and changes in FGM social norms. We found that self-reported exposure was associated with reduced pro-FGM social norms (coeff. = -0.329, p < .001). Additionally, higher doses of Saleema, measured through an exogenous measure of campaign event exposure from an independent monitoring system was associated with reduced pro-FGM social norms (coeff. = -0.146, p < .001). Conclusions Saleema was effective in reducing pro-FGM social norms. It is a promising strategy and findings contribute to the growing literature on social norms approaches to behavior change."
https://openalex.org/W2921123234,"Low shear stress (LSS) increases degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, leading to production of endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of how LSS diminishes the endothelial glycocalyx remain unclear. We showed that LSS inactivated AMPK, enhanced Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE)1 activity, and induced glycocalyx degradation. Activation of AMPK prevented LSS-induced NHE1 activity and endothelial glycocalyx impairment. We further identified hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2) as a mediator of endothelial glycocalyx impairment in HUVECs exposed to LSS. Inactivation of AMPK by LSS up-regulates the activity of HYAL2, which acts downstream of NHE1. We characterized a left common carotid artery partial ligation (PL) model of LSS in C57BL/6 mice. The results showed decreased expression of hyaluronan (HA) in the endothelial glycocalyx and decreased thickness of the endothelial glycocalyx in PL mice. Pharmacological activation of AMPK by ampkinone not only attenuated glycocalyx impairment due to HA degradation but also blocked vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression increase and macrophage recruitment in the endothelia of PL mice. Our results revealed that AMPK dephosphorylation induced by LSS activates NHE1 and HYAL2 to promote HA degradation and glycocalyx injury, which may contribute to endothelial inflammatory reaction and macrophage recruitment.-Zhang, J., Kong, X., Wang, Z., Gao, X., Ge, Z., Gu, Y., Ye, P., Chao, Y., Zhu, L., Li, X., Chen, S.

To assess the prognostic value of QA in predicting functional changes.We retrospectively selected 35 consecutive patients with SSc-ILD with complete pulmonary functional evaluation, Doppler-echocardiography, immunological tests, and chest CT scan at both baseline and follow-up after immunosuppressive therapy. CT images were analyzed by two chest radiologists for semiQA and by a computational platform for texture analysis of ILD patterns (CALIPER) for QA. Concordance between semiQA and QA was tested. Traction bronchiectasis severity was scored. Analysis of ROC curves was performed.Seventy CT scans were analyzed and QA failed in 4/70 scans. Thus, the final population included 31/35 patients (51.3±12.1 years). QA had a weak-to-good concordance with semiQA (ICC reticular:0.275; ICC ground-glass:0.667) and QA correlated better than semiQA (r = -0.3 to -0.74 vs r = -0.3 to -0.4) with functional parameters. Both methods correlated with traction bronchiectases score and pulmonary artery diameter at CT. A pulmonary artery diameter ≥29mm distinguished patients with lower lung volumes and ILD extent greater than 39% (p<0.001). Changes in QA patterns during treatment were not accurate (AUC: 0.50 to 0.70; p>0.05) in predicting disease progression as assessed by functional parameters, whereas variation in total lung volume at QA accurately predicted changes in the composite functional respiratory endpoint with FVC% and DLco% (AUC = 0.74; 95%CI: 0.54 to 0.93; p = 0.03).Pulmonary QA of CT images can objectively quantify specific patterns of ILD changes during treatment in patients with SSc-ILD. Changes in QA patterns do not correlate with functional changes, but variation in total lung volume at QA accurately predicted changes in the composite functional respiratory endpoint with FVC% and DLco%.

The Rutgers Acquired Equivalence Test investigates a specific kind of associative learning, visually guided equivalence learning. The test consists of an acquisition (pair learning) and a test (rule transfer) phase, which are associated primarily with the function of the basal ganglia and the hippocampi, respectively. Earlier studies described that both fundamentally-involved brain structures in the visual associative learning, the basal ganglia and the hippocampi, receive not only visual but also multisensory information. However, no study has investigated whether there is a priority for multisensory guided equivalence learning compared to unimodal ones. Thus we had no data about the modality-dependence or independence of the equivalence learning. In the present study, we have therefore introduced the auditory- and multisensory (audiovisual)-guided equivalence learning paradigms and investigated the performance of 151 healthy volunteers in the visual as well as in the auditory and multisensory paradigms. Our results indicated that visual, auditory and multisensory guided associative learning is similarly effective in healthy humans, which suggest that the acquisition phase is fairly independent from the modality of the stimuli. On the other hand, in the test phase, where participants were presented with acquisitions that were learned earlier and associations that were until then not seen or heard but predictable, the multisensory stimuli elicited the best performance. The test phase, especially its generalization part, seems to be a harder cognitive task, where the multisensory information processing could improve the performance of the participants."
https://openalex.org/W2921073147,"Material from a minimum of twenty-nine individuals of a new ornithopod, represented by nearly every skeletal element, was recovered from the Proctor Lake locality in the Twin Mountains Formation (Aptian) of north-central Texas. This material includes various ontogenetic stages, providing insight into the growth patterns of this species. The new ornithopod, Convolosaurus marri gen. et sp. nov., is recovered outside of Iguanodontia, but forms a clade with Iguanodontia exclusive of Hypsilophodon foxii. The presence and morphology of four premaxillary teeth along with a combination of both basal and derived characters distinguish this taxon from all other ornithopods. Basal characters present in C. marri including the presence of premaxillary teeth, the shape of the dentary teeth, and position of the pterygoid wing on the quadrate, whereas the presence of opisthocoelous cervical vertebrae, large proximal caudal neural spines, and curved maxillary tooth roots suggest C. marri is more derived than 80% of the basal neornithischians included in this analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2922408569,"Information on the population dynamics of a reservoir species have been increasingly adopted to understand and eventually predict the dispersal patterns of infectious diseases throughout an area. Although potentially relevant, to date there are no studies which have investigated the genetic structure of the red fox population in relation to infectious disease dynamics. Therefore, we genetically and spatially characterised the red fox population in the area stretching between the Eastern and Dinaric Alps, which has been affected by both distemper and rabies at different time intervals. Red foxes collected from north-eastern Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia between 2006–2012, were studied using a set of 21 microsatellite markers. We confirmed a weak genetic differentiation within the fox population using Bayesian clustering analyses, and we were able to differentiate the fox population into geographically segregated groups. Our finding might be due to the presence of geographical barriers that have likely influenced the distribution of the fox population, limiting in turn gene flow and spread of infectious diseases. Focusing on the Italian red fox population, we observed interesting variations in the prevalence of both diseases among distinct fox clusters, with the previously identified Italy 1 and Italy 2 rabies as well as distemper viruses preferentially affecting different sub-groups identified in the study. Knowledge of the regional-scale population structure can improve understanding of the epidemiology and spread of diseases. Our study paves the way for an integrated approach for disease control coupling pathogen, host and environmental data to inform targeted control programs in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2920923646,"In plants, the enzyme CCD8 (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8) is involved in the synthesis of an important hormone, strigolactone, and therefore, plays an important role in controlling growth and development. Using cDNA and protein sequence derived from the gene ZmCCD8 from maize, we identified putative orthologs of the gene encoding CCD8 in six other monocots and eight dicots; the sequence similarity ranged from 52-75.9% at the gene level and 60.9-93.7% at the protein level. The average length of the gene was ~3.3 kb (range: 2.08 to 3.98 kb), although the number of introns within the genes differed (4 or 5 in dicots and 3 or 4 in monocots, except in T. urartu with 6 introns). Several cis-acting regulatory elements were identified in the promoters of CCD8 genes, which are known to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. The N-terminal end (up to ~70 amino acids) of CCD8 proteins was highly variable due to insertions, deletions and mismatches. The variation in genes and proteins were particularly conspicuous in T. urartu and Ae. tauschii among the monocots and A. thaliana and P. persica among the dicots. In CCD8 proteins, 12 motifs were also identified, of which 6 were novel; 4 of these novel motifs occurred in all the 15 species. The 3D structures of proteins had the characteristic features of the related enzyme apocarotenoid oxygenase (ACO) of Synechocystis (a representative of cyanobacteria). The results of qRT-PCR in wheat revealed that under phosphorous (P)-starved condition (relative to expression under optimum P used as control), the expression of TaCCD8 genes increased ~37 fold in root tissue of the cultivar C306 and ~33 fold in shoot tissue of the cultivar HUW468 (the two cultivars differed in their P-use efficiency). This suggested that expression of TaCCD8 genes is genotype-dependent and tissue-specific and is regulated under different levels of P supply."
https://openalex.org/W2922386666,"Introduction Circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) allows to treat large esophageal superficial neoplasms, however with a high occurrence of severe esophageal strictures. In a previous work, we demonstrated that the application of a prototype of self-assembling peptide (SAP) matrix on esophageal wounds after a circumferential-ESD delayed the onset of esophageal stricture in a porcine model. The aim of this work was to consolidate these results using the commercialized version of this SAP matrix currently used as a hemostatic agent. Animals and methods Eleven pigs underwent a 5 cm-long circumferential esophageal ESD under general anesthesia. Five pigs were used as a control group and six were treated with the SAP. In the experimental group, 3.5 mL of the SAP matrix were immediately applied on the ESD wound. Stricture rates and esophageal diameter were assessed at day 14 by endoscopy and esophagram, followed by necropsy and histological measurements of inflammation and fibrosis in the esophageal wall. Results At day 14, two animals in the treated group had an esophageal stricture without any symptom, while all animals in the control group had regurgitations and an esophageal stricture (33 vs. 100%, p = 0.045). In the treated group, the mean esophageal diameter at day 14 was 9.5 ± 1 mm vs. 4 ± 0.6 mm in the control group (p = 0.004). Histologically, the neoepithelium was longer in the SAP treated group vs. the control (3075 μm vs. 1155μm, p = 0.014). On immunohistochemistry, the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin was lower in the treated vs. control group. Conclusion Apposition of a self-assembling peptide matrix immediately after a circumferential esophageal ESD reduced by 67% the occurrence of a stricture at day 14, by promoting reepithelialization of the resected area."
https://openalex.org/W2920914490,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive disease associated with cartilage injury and its inherently limited repair capability. Synovium-based cellular constructs (sConstructs) are proposed as possible treatments. Equine sConstructs were produced from decellularized synovium-based extracellular matrix scaffolds (sECM) seeded with synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (sMSC), and engineered to express green fluorescent protein (GFP), or bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Survival, distribution, and chondrogenic potential of the sConstructs in vitro and in vivo were assessed. sConstructs in co-culture with chondrocytes increased chondrocyte proliferation, viability, and Col II production, greatest in BMP-2-sConstructs. Chondrocyte presence increased the production of hyaluronic acid (HA), proteoglycan (PG), and BMP-2 by the sConstructs in a positive feedback loop. sECM alone, or GFP- or BMP-2-sConstructs were implanted in synovium adjacent to clinically created full-thickness rat-knee cartilage lesions. At 5 weeks, the lesion area and implants were resected. Gross anatomy, adjacent articulate cartilage growth and subchondral bone repair were scored; and peripheral, central and cartilage lesion measurements taken. For all scores and measurements, sConstruct implants were significantly greater than controls, greatest with the BMP-2-sConstructs. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated migration of endogenous cells into the sECM, with greater cellularity in the constructs with intense positive GFP staining confirming engraftment of implanted sMSC and continued gene expression. In summary, exposing cartilage to sConstructs was chondrogenic in vitro and in vivo, and resulted in substantially increased growth in vivo. This effect was mediated, in part, by soluble ECM and cell factors and upregulation of anabolic growth proteins, such as BMP-2. This work is “proof of concept” that sConstructs surgically implanted adjacent to cartilage damage can significantly improve cartilage and subchondral bone repair, and potentially prevent the progression of OA."
https://openalex.org/W2950773607,"Hit-to-lead virtual screening frequently relies on a cascade of computational methods that starts with rapid calculations applied to a large number of compounds and ends with more expensive computations restricted to a subset of compounds that passed initial filters. This work focuses on set up protocols for alchemical free energy (AFE) scoring in the context of a Docking–MM/PBSA–AFE cascade. A dataset of 15 congeneric inhibitors of the ACK1 protein was used to evaluate the performance of AFE set up protocols that varied in the steps taken to prepare input files (using previously docked and best scored poses, manual selection of poses, manual placement of binding site water molecules). The main finding is that use of knowledge derived from X-ray structures to model binding modes, together with the manual placement of a bridging water molecule, improves the R2 from 0.45 ± 0.06 to 0.76 ± 0.02 and decreases the mean unsigned error from 2.11 ± 0.08 to 1.24 ± 0.04 kcal mol-1. By contrast a brute force automated protocol that increased the sampling time ten-fold lead to little improvements in accuracy. Besides, it is shown that for the present dataset hysteresis can be used to flag poses that need further attention even without prior knowledge of experimental binding affinities."

In this study, high-throughput sequencing approach was employed to investigate the miRNA population in bacteria of the genus Thalassospira using both the miRDeep2 and CID-miRNA methods. A total of 984 putative miRNAs were identified in 9 species of the genus Thalassospira using both miRDeep and CID-miRNA analyses. Fifty seven conserved putative miRNAs were found in different species of the genus Thalassospira, and up to 6 miRNAs were found to be present at different locations in the T. alkalitolerans JCM 18968T, T. lucentensis QMT2T and T. xianhensis P-4T. None of the putative miRNAs was found to share sequence to the reported miRNAs in E. coli DH10B and S. mutans ATCC 25175.

Because a reduced cell proliferation potential and the consequent regeneration failure of aging muscle have been shown to be governed by lethal-7 (let-7) microRNA-mediated mechanisms, in the present study, we evaluated the role of let-7 in the pathogenesis of OPMD. By a multidisciplinary approach, including conf ocal microscopy, Western blot, and quantitative PCR analyses on muscle biopsies from patients and unaffected individuals, we found a significant increase in let-7 expression in OPMD muscles associated with an unusual high percentage of paired box 7–positive satellite cells. Furthermore, IL-6, a cytokine involved in the regulation of satellite cell proliferation and differentiation and a potential target of let-7, was found strongly down-regulated in OPMD compared with control muscles. The decrease in IL-6 transcript levels and protein content was also confirmed in vitro during differentiation of patients' and controls' muscle cells. Overall, our data suggest a key role of let-7 in the regeneration and degeneration process in OPMD muscle and pointed to IL-6 as a potential target molecule for new therapeutic approaches for this disorder.—Cappelletti, C., Galbardi, B., Bruttini, M., Salerno, F., Canioni, E., Pasanisi, M.

The acute glucose-lowering and insulinotropic effects of xGLP159 and xGLP296 were assessed in the Institute of Cancer Research, Kunming, and diabetic (db/db) mice. The pharmacokinetic profiles of xGLP159 and xGLP296 were confirmed on Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and their long-acting hypoglycemic and anorectic effects were evaluated in db/db mice. Chronic treatment effects of xGLP159 and xGLP296 were evaluated in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and db/db mice. The results showed that xGLP159 and xGLP296 exhibited comparable receptor activation potency, hypoglycemic effect, and insulinotropic activity to liraglutide. The enhanced half-lives of xGLP159 and xGLP296 in SD rats (5.1 and 5.8 h, respectively) resulted in prolonged anti-db/db durations in db/db mice. Three weeks' administration of xGLP159 and xGLP296 normalized glucose tolerance and adiposity in DIO mice.

https://openalex.org/W2910200025,"The zebrafish has become a valuable model for examining ocular lens development, physiology and disease. The zebrafish cloche mutant, first described for its loss of hematopoiesis, also shows reduced eye and lens size, interruption in lens cell differentiation and a cataract likely caused by abnormal protein aggregation. To facilitate the use of the cloche mutant for studies on cataract development and prevention we characterized variation in the lens phenotype, quantified changes in gene expression by qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq and compared the ability of two promoters to drive expression of introduced proteins into the cloche lens. We found that the severity of cloche embryo lens cataract varied, while the decrease in lens diameter and retention of nuclei in differentiating lens fiber cells was constant. We found very low expression of both αB-crystallin genes (cryaba and cryabb) at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) by both qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq in cloche, cloche sibling and wildtype embryos and no significant difference in αA-crystallin (cryaa) expression. RNA-Seq analysis of 4 dpf embryos identified transcripts from 25,281 genes, with 1,329 showing statistically significantly different expression between cloche and wildtype samples. Downregulation of eight lens β- and γM-crystallin genes and 22 retinal related genes may reflect a general reduction in eye development and growth. Six stress response genes were upregulated. We did not find misregulation of any known components of lens development gene regulatory networks. These results suggest that the cloche lens cataract is not caused by loss of αA-crystallin or changes to lens gene regulatory networks. Instead, we propose that the cataract results from general physiological stress related to loss of hematopoiesis. Our finding that the zebrafish αA-crystallin promoter drove strong GFP expression in the cloche lens demonstrates its use as a tool for examining the effects of introduced proteins on lens crystallin aggregation and cataract prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2921077677,"Lifestyle-related, non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity have become critical concerns in the Pacific islands of Micronesia. We investigated the relationship between the diminution of traditional lifestyle practices and the decline in the health of the population in the State of Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. To assess this, our interdisciplinary team developed two scales, one to rank individuals on how traditional their lifestyles were and one to rank individuals on the healthiness of their lifestyles. Participants’ locations were categorized as living on a remote atoll, living on the main island, or as a transitional population. Pohnpeians living in transitional communities (e.g. recently moved from a remote atoll to the main island, or the reverse) ranked lowest on both the tradition and health scales, rather than ranking intermediate between the remote and main island groups as we had hypothesized. As predicted, individuals residing on the remote atolls were living the most traditional lifestyles and also had the healthiest lifestyles, based on our rating system. The higher an individual scored on the tradition scale, e.g. the more traditional life they lived, the higher they scored on the health scale, suggesting the importance of traditional lifestyle practices for maintaining health. These findings have significant implications for promoting health and longevity of Micronesians and other Pacific Island peoples. We suggest the process of transition be recognized as a significant lifestyle and health risk and be given the attention we give to other risk factors that negatively influence our health. Based on our findings, we discuss and recommend the revitalization of particular traditional lifestyle practices, which may advance healthy aging among Pohnpeians."

Here, we show that Nav1.8 channel plasma membrane localization, retention, and stability occur through a direct interaction with the postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-l-and WW domain-containing scaffold protein called membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted orientation (Magi)-l. The neurophysiological roles of Magi-1 are largely unknown, but we found that dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-specific knockdown of Magi-1 attenuated thermal nociception and acute inflammatory pain and produced deficits in Nav1.8 protein expression. A competing cell-penetrating peptide mimetic derived from the Nav1.8 WW binding motif decreased sodium currents, reduced Nav1.8 protein expression, and produced hypoexcitability. Remarkably, a phosphorylated variant of the very same peptide caused an opposing increase in Nav1.8 surface expression and repetitive firing. Likewise, in vivo, the peptides produced diverging effects on nocifensive behavior. Additionally, we found that Magi-1 bound to sequence like a calcium-activated potassium channel sodium-activated (Slack) potassium channels, demonstrating macrocomplexing with Nav1.8 channels. Taken together, these findings emphasize Magi-1 as an essential scaffold for ion transport in DRG neurons and a central player in pain.—Pryce, K. D., Powell, R., Agwa, D., Evely, K. M., Sheehan, G.

This study quantified activity in the home cage of rhesus monkeys and examined the extent to which activity can be used to quantify tolerance to and dependence on Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). Home-cage activity was measured in one group that received Δ9-THC (1 mg/kg s.c.) every 12 h (i.e., chronic Δ9-THC), and a second group that received Δ9-THC (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) once every 3 days (i.e., intermittent Δ9-THC). Treatment was temporarily discontinued in the chronic Δ9-THC group and the effects of rimonabant and Δ9-THC were examined in both groups. Activity counts were highest during the day (lights on 0600-2000 h) and were lower at night. Rimonabant (0.1-3.2 mg/kg i.v.) dose-dependently increased activity (maximum 20-fold) in the chronic Δ9-THC group but did not significantly alter activity in the intermittent Δ9-THC group. Δ9-THC (0.32-3.2 mg/kg i.v.) dose-dependently decreased activity counts (maximum 4-fold) in both groups but was somewhat more potent in the intermittent as compared with the Δ9-THC group. Discontinuation of Δ9-THC treatment resulted in an immediate (i.e., within 24 h) and time-related increase in activity. The time-related increase in home-cage activity upon abrupt discontinuation of chronic Δ9-THC treatment, as well as the effects of rimonabant to increase activity in monkeys receiving chronic, but not intermittent, Δ9-THC treatment, are consistent with signs of physical dependence on Δ9-THC in primates."

Epithelial thickness, stratification, outgrowth, ultrastructure and phenotype were assessed.Epithelial thickness and stratification were similar between the groups. Outgrowth size correlated positively with explant size (r = 0.37; P = 0.01), whereas fold growth correlated negatively with explant size (r = -0.55; P < 0.0001). Percentage of cells expressing the limbal epithelial cell marker K19 was higher in cells derived from large explants (99.1±1.2%) compared to cells derived from small explants (93.2±13.6%, P = 0.024). The percentage of cells expressing ABCG2, integrin β1, p63, and p63α that are markers suggestive of an immature phenotype; Keratin 3, Connexin 43, and E-Cadherin that are markers of differentiation; and Ki67 and PCNA that indicate cell proliferation were equal in both groups. Desmosome and hemidesmosome densities were equal between the groups.For donor- and culture conditions used in the present study, large explants are preferable to small in terms of outgrowth area.

https://openalex.org/W2920872336,"Objectives Maternal lifestyles, including diet, have been linked to infant birthweight. However, customised birthweight centiles (CBWC), which more accurately identify small babies that have increased fetal growth restriction and are at higher risk of newborn morbidity and later life health complications, are rarely considered when studying maternal diet. This study investigated maternal dietary patterns and their impact on infant CBWC within a cohort of women living in South Wales. Methods This study utilised cross-sectional data from the longitudinal Grown in Wales (GiW) cohort. Women 18–45 years old were recruited the morning prior to an elective caesarean section (ELCS). Women completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Additional data on pregnancy and birth outcomes was extracted from medical notes. Data from 303 participants was analysed. Results ‘Western’ and ‘Health conscious dietary patterns were identified. The ‘Health Conscious’ dietary pattern was significantly associated with maternal BMI, age, education, income and exercise. Adjusted regression analyses indicated that greater adherence to a ‘Health Conscious’ dietary pattern was significantly associated with increased CBWC (AOR = 4.75 [95% CI: 1.17, 8.33] p = .010) and reduced risk of delivering a small-for-gestational age (SGA) infant (AOR = .51 [95% CI: .26, .99] p = .046).

Despite the physiological significance of the variables extracted from the WAnT, the test is very intense, and generally applies for athletes. Our goal, in this paper, was to develop a new approach to predict the anaerobic mechanical power outputs using maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise stress test (CPET). We hypothesized that maximal incremental exercise stress test hold hidden information about the anaerobic components, which can be directly translated into mechanical power outputs. We therefore designed a computational model that included aerobic variables (features), and used a new computational \ predictive algorithm, which enabled the prediction of the anaerobic mechanical power outputs. We analyzed the chosen predicted features using clustering on a network. For peak power (PP) and mean power (MP) outputs, the equations included six features and four features, respectively. The combination of these features produced a prediction model of r = 0.94 and r = 0.9, respectively, on the validation set between the real and predicted PP/MP values (P< 0.001). The newly predictive model allows the accurate prediction of the anaerobic mechanical power outputs at high accuracy. The assessment of additional tests is desired for the development of a robust application for athletes, older individuals, and/or non-healthy populations."

Based on the reduced model, we analyze the stability of the incoherent state and find the existence of multiple stability islands for the incoherent state depending on the parameters. Furthermore, we numerically simulate the reduced model and find a large number of twisted states resulting from the instabilities of the incoherent state with respect to different spatial modes. For some winding numbers, the stability region of the corresponding twisted state consists of two disjoint parameter regions, one for the intermediate coupling strength and the other for the strong coupling strength."

Here, we explored the development of this number-space association by assessing how 7-, 9-, 11-year-olds, and adults differed in spatial orienting of attention on Posner' paradigm. Compared with the previous research, we examined how the cues would affect the level and strength of the SNARC effect in children under the different attentional conditions. Subjects made parity decisions for endogenous attention (Experiment 1) and exogenous attention (Experiment 2). The results showed that adults displayed the SNARC effect in both experiments, relatively speaking, 7- to 11-year-old Chinese children's ability of spatial numerical association progressed gradually. With endogenous attention, the SNARC effect appeared in all age groups except for 7-year-olds for invalid cues. Compared with the endogenous attention condition, the SNARC effect was more significantly affected by cues in the exogenous attention condition. This result might be owing to the fact that the SNARC effect was not demonstrated in 7-year-olds with either valid or invalid cues. Our results suggest that the differences in the spatial orienting of attention are based on the cognitive load associated with processing number information and that this process can be affected by cues. Further, there may be cross-cultural influences on the SNARC effect, as early family training may explain the results seen in this sample of Chinese 7-year-olds. Thus, reaction times decreased with increasing age in the parity judgment task, and reaction times for valid cues were faster than for invalid cues regardless of the age group in both experiments. The SNARC effect was only present for 7-year-olds for valid cues, for endogenous attention."

Telomeres are an established marker for cellular senescence and have served to evaluate cardiovascular diseases including severe aortic valve stenosis. In our study, we hypothesized that telomere length may be a predictor for outcome and associated with comorbidities in patients with TAVR.We analyzed leucocyte telomere length from 155 patients who underwent TAVR and correlated the results with 1-year mortality and severe comorbidities. The cohort was subdivided into 3 groups according to telomere length. Although a trend for a positive correlation of telomere length with a lower EuroSCORE could be found, telomere length was not associated with survival, aortic valve opening area or cardiovascular comorbidities (peripheral, coronary or cerebrovascular disease). Interestingly, long telomeres were significantly correlated to a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).In elderly patients with severe aortic valve stenosis, leucocyte telomere length did not predict post-procedural survival. The correlation between long telomere length and reduced LVEF in these patients deserves further attention."
https://openalex.org/W2921762100,"In many work and decision situations, realizing cooperation among individuals is important. However, decision making environments of individuals are far from stable, resulting in changes in task complexity and the social settings they encounter. We argue that past experiences with cooperative behavior can result in different cooperative norms and expectations about the behavior of others and will have an effect on an individual’s subsequent behavior in new situations. This study experimentally investigates these dynamics of cooperative behavior in social dilemmas and addresses the role of communication to provide empirical evidence about a cognitive mechanism that may lead to these spillovers. Specifically, the experimental design randomly assigns subjects to one type of repetitive interactions in the first social dilemma (single partner or different partners) and we then examine how this impacts the propensity to behave cooperatively in subsequent social dilemmas with unfamiliar partners (either single or different). Because of the variety in complexity of decision-making environments in practice, we do so by examining behavioral spillovers across three different social dilemmas that vary in difficulty to make cooperation successful. Our findings show that individuals cooperate more during initial interactions with a single partner. More importantly, this has positive spillover effects for subsequent behavior and communication, even to settings without repeated interactions with a single partner. However, environmental conditions affect the ability to transfer established norms of cooperation to subsequent interactions, as an initially learned cooperative norm is gradually replaced by a more competitive attitude when individuals start to interact with unfamiliar others in a setting in which cooperative success is more difficult to achieve. Our findings illustrate the power of repeated interactions for establishing and sustaining cooperation in other settings and enhance understanding of how cooperative decisions can be shaped by both incentives and the broader behavioral context of individuals."
