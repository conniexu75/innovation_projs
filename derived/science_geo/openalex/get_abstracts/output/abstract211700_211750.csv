Yet no definite function could be attributed, to their presence in this diencephalic structure."

https://openalex.org/W2076813561,Obesity in migratory birds appears to differ from obesity in man in that gains and losses in body weight do not involve changes in the tissue structure of the body; fat is added to and used from preexisting tissue spaces without appreciable change in the water content or the nonfat dry weight of the body as a whole. Evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that the nonfat body is essentially homeostatic during migration despite very large scale changes in total body weight.
https://openalex.org/W2060307790,"Poliovirus-infected HeLa cells contain a small amount of an RNA that sediments slightly faster than 16S. This RNA is less dense than viral RNA and resists digestion by ribonuclease. It is therefore, considered to be a double-stranded form of poliovirus RNA. A significant amount of this material is found in association with a membranous virus-specific particulate."

https://openalex.org/W2061893200,"IN a recent communication Finean and Rumsby1 have cast doubt on the reliability of the electron microscopic image obtained from negatively stained preparations of lipoprotein membrane structures (myelin, mitochondria, microsomes and red cell ghosts). Although we agree with their remarks about the need for caution in interpreting such electron micrographs, it is felt that further comment is necessary concerning some of the published literature2,3 mentioned by them."
https://openalex.org/W2016586548,"THERE is evidence that pressure blinding abolishes all activity of the ganglion cells of the retina1. It has been suggested2 that the after-effect of exposing an eye to a moving stimulus (the waterfall illusion; see preceding communication) may be caused by the reduction of maintained discharge of the directionally sensitive retinal ganglion cells which were stimulated during the period of inspection, leaving the maintained activity of those which would signal the reverse motion unbalanced. If this is correct, then pressure blinding the eye during the period immediately following stimulation should abolish the effect. Unfortunately, one is not clearly aware of the movement illusion if there are no objects that one can see as moving, and pressure blinding prevents seeing. One therefore has to perform the test on the illusion transferred to objects seen with the other eye. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the existence of this transfer has often been taken as convincing evidence for the central origin of the after-effects, but the transfer would be explicable on the hypothesis that it is due to suppression of maintained discharge even if this occurred only in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2066455981,"Actinomycin D injected simultaneously with sheep erythrocytes in female rats caused a delay in the immune response but had no effect on the rate or maximum amount of hemagglutinin produced. The delay was roughly proportional to the concentration of the antibiotic administered, and was up to 2 days for 75 microg in a 200-gram female rat (sublethal dose for females). The dose effect in the delay in response is consistent with the time when actinomycin would no longer be available to bind with newly synthesized DNA and when messenger-RNA production could occur. Similar results were obtained with another antigen, the enzyme beta-galactosidase, in male rats during the secondary response."

https://openalex.org/W2023202951,"Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, when administered to animals or human beings, causes sleep. It is convertible to gamma-butyrolactone, which also produces sleep. Tissue concentrations in rats after administration of these two compounds show that the induced sleep is related to the concentration of the lactone in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2006315637,"By disc electrophoresis of the axoplasm of Dosidicus gigas, 14 protein bands have been resolved. Antibodies to the intra-axonal proteins and to squid blood proteins were produced in rabbits. By Ouchterlony's technique, six antigenic components can be demonstrated in axoplasm; the combined use of disc electrophoresis and immune diffusion in agar resolves seven antigenic components in axoplasm; none of these components is detectable in squid blood."

https://openalex.org/W1963659413,"Rats with transected spinal cords showed electroencephalographic desynchronization and exhibited behavioral arousal in response to x-irradiation of the whole body of the head only, at dose rates between 0.5 and 1.5 roentgens per second. Neither arousal nor desynchronization occurred when only the body of the animal was exposed. Results indicate that neither the circulatory system nor the vagi are essential to the arousal reaction to x-irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1983562774,"CHITINOLYTIC activity has previously been demonstrated in the gut contents of Periplaneta americana (L.)1, and a fraction, chitinase I, has now been separated and purified from this source by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by fractionation on DEAE cellulose. Two additional peaks with acetylaminodeoxyglucosidase and another with chitinase activity were also observed in the effluent from DEAE cellulose columns. The terms chitinase and acetylaminodeoxyglucosidase as used here refer to enzymes No. 3/2/1/14 and No. 3/2/1/30 of the International Union of Biochemistry nomenclature2. Chitobiose, a substrate of chitobiase (enzyme No. 3/2/1/29), is the disaccharide of acetylaminodeoxyglucose, and the other oligosaccharides used form a series3. For convenience the oligosaccharides are referred to as biose, triose, etc. The chitin used was a suspension prepared by reprecipitation of purified crayfish (Jasus verreauxi H. M. Edw.) chitin from sulphuric acid. The products of digestion, up to hexaose, were satisfactorily separated by paper chromatography using a solvent of pentan-2-ol/ pyridine/water (1:1:1)4. Oligosaccharide spots were located by chlorination followed by a starch-iodide spray in a modification of the Rydon and Smith5 method for peptides. The oligosaccharides gave similar colour densities per unit weight, unlike the results given by other methods, such as silver development, in which the colour varies considerably with the size of the oligosaccharide."

https://openalex.org/W1999767682,"Reducing the target diameter of an adapting (conditioning) flash of light results in a progressive rise in the conventional light adaptation curve, as measured with a small superimposed test flash presented at the end of adapting flashes of variable duration. When both targets are the same size, an abrupt and marked rise in threshold is obtained, resulting from a unique effect that occurs near the termination of the adapting flash. This effect can be demonstrated by means of a variable delay procedure, and it indicates that neural as well as photo-chemical processes limit the time course of light adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W1967280052,"IT is well established that there is a striking depletion of liver glycogen in endotoxin intoxication, and insulin, glucose and lactate are relatively ineffective in increasing liver glycogen storage1. This depletion of liver glycogen is not necessarily due to epinephrine discharge or to circulatory disturbances attendant on intoxication, but it seems to be related to the accumulation of endotoxin in liver2. The characteristic prostration common to all animal species in the later stage of endotoxin intoxication seems to be related to this depletion of glycogen2. It is especially pronounced in adrenalectomized animals, and death results from hypoglycæmic deterioration with or without cramp. It is well known that pretreatment with cortisone prevents death1. Although the mechanism of glycogen depletion has been discussed in relation to inhibition of hepatic enzymes, especially succinic dehydrogenase3, or to the effect on mitochondria leading to oxidative uncoupling4, no conclusive evidence indicating special relations of endotoxin to these disturbances could be obtained. In this respect it has been shown that the effect of endotoxin in depleting liver glycogen in rabbits is much lessened in the hot summer season even in adrenalectomized animals5. It has therefore been suggested that the depletion of liver glycogen might be determined by the metabolic response of liver induced by the uptake of endotoxin in the hepatic reticuloendothelial cells. Here it was shown that saturation with ascorbic acid could ameliorate the depletion of liver glycogen in cold weather in which the susceptibility of the animal is markedly enhanced."

https://openalex.org/W2070350747,"ALTHOUGH neostigmine (prostigmin) has been used for about thirty years for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, and later for the post-operative reversal of tubocurarine, relatively little seems to be known about the mechanisms involved in its metabolism and excretion. The inhibition of plasma cholinesterase has been used as a convenient indicator of neostigmine concentration, and it has been shown that after administration to dogs and to patients with myasthenia gravis, elimination of neostigmine depends on the dose and method of administration1. Some of these conclusions have been confirmed in more recent work where a colorimetric method was used for the measurement of neostigmine in urine2. Thus when neostigmine methylsulphate is given by intramuscular injection to patients with myasthenia gravis, about 50 per cent of the dose is excreted unchanged, whereas after oral administration little or no unchanged drug can be detected in the urine2,6."

Several properties of this bactericidin are known to be shared by haemolytic complement, such as inactivation by heating at 56° C for 30 min and removal by filtration through Seitz filter pads. Complement, like bactericidin, is absent from uncoagulated cell-free plasma2. Further investigations comparing the two serum activities were undertaken."
