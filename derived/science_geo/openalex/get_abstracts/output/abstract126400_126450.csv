https://openalex.org/W2016575029,"Brain injury, as occurs in stroke or head trauma, induces a dramatic increase in levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), but its role in brain injury response is unknown. We generated mice genetically deficient in TNF receptors (TNFR-KO) to determine the role of TNF in brain cell injury responses. Damage to neurons caused by focal cerebral ischemia and epileptic seizures was exacerbated in TNFR-KO mice, indicating that TNF serves a neuroprotective function. Oxidative stress was increased and levels of an antioxidant enzyme reduced in brain cells of TNFR-KO mice, indicating that TNF protects neurons by stimulating antioxidant pathways. Injury-induced microglial activation was suppressed in TNFR-KO mice, demonstrating a key role for TNF in injury-induced immune response. Drugs that target TNF signaling pathways may prove beneficial in treating stroke and traumatic brain injury."

Homozygous mice deficient in GLT-1, a widely distributed astrocytic glutamate transporter, show lethal spontaneous seizures and increased susceptibility to acute cortical injury. These effects can be attributed to elevated levels of residual glutamate in the brains of these mice."

However, their use is limited by the risk of severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Eight patients who relapsed or developed Epstein-Barr virus–induced lymphoma after T cell–depleted BMT were then treated with donor lymphocytes transduced with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) suicide gene. The transduced lymphocytes survived for up to 12 months, resulting in antitumor activity in five patients. Three patients developed GvHD, which could be effectively controlled by ganciclovir-induced elimination of the transduced cells. These data show that genetic manipulation of donor lymphocytes may increase the efficacy and safety of allo-BMT and expand its application to a larger number of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2069849662,"The gene responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, a disease characterized by neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy, has recently been cloned and its product designated frataxin. A gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was characterized whose predicted protein product has high sequence similarity to the human frataxin protein. The yeast gene (yeast frataxin homolog, YFH1) encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis and respiratory function. Human frataxin also was shown to be a mitochondrial protein. Characterizing the mechanism by which YFH1 regulates iron homeostasis in yeast may help to define the pathologic process leading to cell damage in Friedreich's ataxia."

https://openalex.org/W2084952038,"Exposure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high extracellular osmolarity induces the Sln1p-Ypd1p-Ssk1p two-component osmosensor to activate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade composed of the Ssk2p and Ssk22p MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), the Pbs2p MAPKK, and the Hog1p MAPK. A second osmosensor, Sho1p, also activated Pbs2p and Hog1p, but did so through the Ste11p MAPKKK. Although Ste11p also participates in the mating pheromone–responsive MAPK cascade, there was no detectable cross talk between these two pathways. The MAPKK Pbs2p bound to the Sho1p osmosensor, the MAPKKK Ste11p, and the MAPK Hog1p. Thus, Pbs2p may serve as a scaffold protein."
https://openalex.org/W1992743196,"The crystal structures of a germline antibody Fab fragment and its complex with hapten have been solved at 2.1 Å resolution. These structures are compared with the corresponding crystal structures of the affinity-matured antibody, 48G7, which has a 30,000 times higher affinity for hapten as a result of nine replacement somatic mutations. Significant changes in the configuration of the combining site occur upon binding of hapten to the germline antibody, whereas hapten binds to the mature antibody by a lock-and-key fit mechanism. The reorganization of the combining site that was nucleated by hapten binding is further optimized by somatic mutations that occur up to 15 Å from bound hapten. These results suggest that the binding potential of the primary antibody repertoire may be significantly expanded by the ability of germline antibodies to adopt more than one combining-site configuration, with both antigen binding and somatic mutation stabilizing the configuration with optimal hapten complementarity."
https://openalex.org/W2027072294,"Orbital integrations carried out for 4 billion years produced a disk of scattered objects beyond the orbit of Neptune. Objects in this disk can be distinguished from Kuiper belt objects by a greater range of eccentricities and inclinations. This disk was formed in the simulations by encounters with Neptune during the early evolution of the outer solar system. After particles first encountered Neptune, the simulations show that about 1 percent of the particles survive in this disk for the age of the solar system. A disk currently containing as few as ∼6 × 10 8 objects could supply all of the observed Jupiter-family comets. Two recently discovered objects, 1996 RQ 20 and 1996 TL 66 , have orbital elements similar to those predicted for objects in this disk, suggesting that they are thus far the only members of this disk to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W2110956170,"Two families of small peptides that bind to the human thrombopoietin receptor and compete with the binding of the natural ligand thrombopoietin (TPO) were identified from recombinant peptide libraries. The sequences of these peptides were not found in the primary sequence of TPO. Screening libraries of variants of one of these families under affinity-selective conditions yielded a 14–amino acid peptide (Ile-Glu-Gly-Pro-Thr-Leu-Arg-Gln-Trp-Leu-Ala-Ala-Arg-Ala) with high affinity (dissociation constant ≈ 2 nanomolar) that stimulates the proliferation of a TPO-responsive Ba/F3 cell line with a median effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 400 nanomolar. Dimerization of this peptide by a carboxyl-terminal linkage to a lysine branch produced a compound with an EC 50 of 100 picomolar, which was equipotent to the 332–amino acid natural cytokine in cell-based assays. The peptide dimer also stimulated the in vitro proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes from human bone marrow cells and promoted an increase in platelet count when administered to normal mice."
https://openalex.org/W2055696255,"Retinal neovascularization is the major cause of untreatable blindness. The role of growth hormone (GH) in ischemia-associated retinal neovascularization was studied in transgenic mice expressing a GH antagonist gene and in normal mice given an inhibitor of GH secretion (MK678). Retinal neovascularization was inhibited in these mice in inverse proportion to serum levels of GH and a downstream effector, insulin-like growth factor–I (IGF-I). Inhibition was reversed with exogenous IGF-I administration. GH inhibition did not diminish hypoxia-stimulated retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor expression. These data suggest that systemic inhibition of GH or IGF-I, or both, may have therapeutic potential in preventing some forms of retinopathy."

Here, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the PLN transmembrane sequence was used to identify two functional domains on opposite faces of the transmembrane helix. Mutations in one face diminish inhibitory interactions with transmembrane sequences of SERCA2a, but have relatively little effect on the pentameric state, while mutations in the other face activate inhibitory interactions and enhance monomer formation. Double mutants are monomeric, but loss of inhibitory function is dominant over activation of inhibitory function. These observations support the proposal that the SERCA2a interaction site lies on the helical face which is not involved in pentamer formation. Four highly inhibitory mutants are effectively devoid of pentamer, suggesting that pentameric PLN represents a less active or inactive reservoir that dissociates to provide inhibitory monomeric PLN subunits. A model is presented in which the degree of PLN inhibition of SERCA2a activity is ultimately determined by the concentration of the inhibited PLN monomer·SERCA2a heterodimeric complex. The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is likely to be mutation-sensitive).

Phospholamban (PLN) 1The abbreviations used are: PLN, phospholamban; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA2a, cardiac SERCA isoform; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a 52-amino acid, integral membrane protein (1Fujii J. Ueno A. Kitano K. Tanaka S. Kadoma M. Tada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that interacts with and reversibly inhibits the activity of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a). In this role, it is a major regulator of the kinetics of cardiac contractility (2Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). PLN has the mobility of a homopentamer in SDS gels, but the pentamer is dissociated to monomers by boiling in SDS (3Jones L.R.

It is an open question whether the functional inhibitory unit is a pentamer or a monomer and whether pentamers and monomers are in dynamic equilibrium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Much attention has been directed toward the phosphorylation sites on Ser16 and Thr17 in cytoplasmic domain Ia of PLN and their role in regulating the inhibitory function of PLN (4Tada M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In earlier studies we showed that the PLN cytoplasmic interaction site is formed by charged and hydrophobic amino acids 1–20 (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the complementary SERCA2a interaction site consists of amino acids Lys-Asp-Asp-Lys-Pro-Val402 (7Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22929-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a later evaluation of potential transmembrane interaction sites (8Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we coexpressed SERCA2a with PLN transmembrane sequences 31–52 (PLN domain II) or with PLN domain II constructs to which NH2-terminal, cytoplasmic epitopes such as PLN1–20 or hemagglutinin were fused. We found that the inhibitory interaction site lies entirely in the transmembrane sequences of PLN and SERCA2a, but can be modulated, through long range interactions, by the noninhibitory cytoplasmic interaction site. We also discovered the phenomenon of “supershifting,” in which the apparent affinity of specific PLN mutants for SERCA2a is enhanced, so that Ca2+ concentrations well above the physiological range are required to reverse the inhibitory action of the mutant PLN. In the present study, we associate gain of function with PLN mutants that promote PLN depolymerization. Since the most inhibitory mutants of PLN are devoid of pentamer, we deduce that the pentamer represents a less active or inactive reservoir of subunits and that the PLN monomer is the functional, inhibitory form. For mutagenesis, a 172-base pair fragment containing the coding sequence for rabbit PLN (bases −6 to 162 (9Fujii J. Lytton J. Tada M. MacLennan D.H.

The product was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) after digestion with XbaI andSalI. Mutagenesis with this construct as a template was carried out as described previously (11Kunkel T.A.

A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant PLN cDNAs were ligated into the XbaI and SalI sites of the pMT2 expression vector (13Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and amplified. Plasmid DNA was purified by adsorption to and elution from Qiagen tip-500 columns. PLN and SERCA2a cDNAs in the pMT2 vector were cotransfected (8 μg of each cDNA per dish) into HEK-293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (14Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausulbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and microsomes were prepared and assayed for Ca2+ transport activity as described previously (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed as described previously (8Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Immunoblotting of SERCA2a and wild type and mutant forms of PLN expressed in HEK-293 cell microsomes was carried out with 10 μg of microsomal proteins. Proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer at room temperature, separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with monoclonal antibody IID8F6 against SERCA2a or antibody 1D11 against PLN (15Mayer E.J.

Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp). Oligomer/monomer ratios were calculated by scanning densitometry of individual lanes in the exposed films of the immunoblots of the gels. In earlier studies (8Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that inhibitory interactions between PLN and SERCA2a occur through intramembrane interactions. To characterize these inhibitory interactions, we mutated each of PLN transmembrane (domain II) amino acids, Leu31through Leu52, to Ala and expressed the mutant PLN cDNAs with SERCA2a cDNA in HEK-293 cells. Microsomes were isolated from transfected cells and Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ transport was measured for each isolate. The reduction in the apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+(ΔK Ca expressed in −pCa units) provided a measure of the inhibitory function of wild type or mutated PLN (Fig.1 A). The ΔK Ca for PLN was −0.33 pCa units. PLN mutants, L31A, N34A, F35A, I38A, L42A, I48A, V49A, and L52A, had diminished inhibitory function relative to PLN, as indicated by ΔK Ca values between 0 and about −0.2 pCa units. PLN mutants, F32A, I33A, L37A, I40A, L43A, L44A, I47A, M50A, and L51A, gained inhibitory function relative to PLN, as indicated by ΔK Ca values between about −0.43 and −0.8 pCa units. PLN mutants, C36A, L39A, C41A, I45A and C46A, had unaltered function, as indicated by ΔK Cavalues not significantly different from −0.33 pCa units. Loss or gain of PLN function could not be correlated with different levels of expression (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, supershifting was not induced by overexpression of PLN (8Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have assumed that residues Leu31 to Leu52form an α-helix (16Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M.

Loss and gain of function of the PLN mutants is seen to be cyclical and progressive, repeating every three or four residues, as would be expected if loss of function were associated with mutations on one face of the PLN domain II helix and gain of function were associated with mutations on the opposite face. Wild type PLN is about 75% pentameric in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B, Table I), but is dissociated to a monomer by boiling in SDS under reducing or nonreducing conditions (3Jones L.R. Simmerman H.K.B. Wilson W.W. Gurd F.R.N. Wegener A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7721-7730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants of Leu37, Ile40, Leu44, and Ile47 are monomeric without boiling, as suggested by their mobility in SDS-PAGE (16Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M.

These studies have led to structural models in which these residues lie on one face of the PLN domain II helix and play a role in pentamer formation (18Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M.

Open table in a new tab Monomer percent was determined by scanning densitometry of pentameric and monomeric bands in individual lanes from SDS-PAGE gels, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inhibitory function is indicated: N, normal; L, loss of inhibitory function; G, gain of inhibitory function. In Fig. 1 B, we show the results of SDS-PAGE analysis of the pentamer stability of unboiled samples of PLN and each of the 22 PLN mutants. Estimates of the percent monomer (Table I) show that the mutants can be divided into four broad classes. Class 1 has the same or less monomer than wild type PLN; Class 2 has roughly twice as much monomer as PLN; Class 3 has roughly three times as much monomer as PLN; and Class 4 has roughly four times as much monomer as PLN, being virtually 100% monomer. As in Fig. 1 A, we have numbered the PLN mutants in Fig. 1 B in four linear sequences of seven residues. Loss and conservation of pentamer stability, like loss and gain of function, is cyclical and progressive, repeating every three or four residues, as would be expected if loss of stability were associated with mutations on one face of the PLN domain II helix. The cyclical changes of loss and gain of function and of pentamer stability are clearly in phase. When the location of each mutated amino acid is plotted on a helical wheel representing the PLN domain II helix (Fig. 2), it is apparent that different classes of mutants are clustered. Loss of function mutants lie on one face of the helix (the proposed exterior face of each helix in a PLN pentamer (18Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)). Measurement of percent monomer places all of these residues in Classes 1 or 2. Gain of function mutants all lie on the opposite face of the helix (the proposed interior face of each helix in a PLN pentamer (18Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)). Measurement of percent monomer places all of these mutants in Classes 3 or 4. Measurement of percent monomer in the five mutations that did not alter function placed them in Classes 1, 2, and 3. We propose that the loss of function that occurs with each of the eight mutants, L31A, N34A, F35A, I38A, L42A, I48A, V49A, and L52A, on the exterior face of the helix, reflects the fact that each of these amino acids is essential for the interaction of the PLN domain II helix with complementary amino acids in the hydrophobic, transmembrane helices in SERCA2a. Ile45 and Cys41 lie on this helical face, but their function was unaltered by mutation. Ile45 (forming a Class 1 mutant) may have no suitable complement in the helical transmembrane sequences of SERCA2a and may play no role in interhelix interactions. The C41A mutant is substantially depolymerized (Class 3), but function is unaltered. This suggests that depolymerization is not the only requirement for activation of inhibitory function. The next steps must be formation of a PLN monomer·SERCA2a complex, followed by the formation of inhibitory interactions between specific amino acids. The ultimate stability of the inhibited PLN monomer·SERCA2a complex will also determine the degree of gain of inhibitory function. Mutation of Cys36, Leu39, or Cys46did not alter inhibitory function, but doubled the extent of depolymerization, placing these mutants in Class 2. These residues lie on an ill-defined boundary between the two functional domains where, in these cases, mutation does not seem to be particularly critical for either inhibitory function or pentamer formation. The definition of this boundary is of interest, because the Class 3, gain of function mutant, F32A, is clearly not a nonfunctional resident of the “boundary” area. Perhaps there is a distortion of the transmembrane helix near its cytoplasmic boundary, which aligns Phe32with the interior face of the rest of the helix or the bulky side chain of Phe32 might, itself, distort the boundary. All three Cys to Ala mutations destabilized the pentamer (Fig.1 B and Ref. 20Fujii J. Maruyama K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but retained normal function (Fig.1 A). Since Cys is “tiny”, whereas residues at each of the other 19 positions are “small” (Val, Asn) or “bulky” (Leu, Ile, Met, Phe) (21Taylor W.R. J. Theor. Biol. 1986; 119: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the mutation of Cys to Ala would not alter the bulk of the side chain significantly. This may account, in part, for their unaltered function. However, we do not know enough about the full effects of these mutant proteins on the formation of an inhibited PLN monomer·SERCa2a complex to understand their full meaning, nor do we understand why mutation of all three of these residues destabilizes the pentamer so effectively, when they are not believed to be key stabilizing residues in the PLN pentamer (18Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The nine Class 3 and 4 mutants, I33A, F32A, L37A, I40A, L43A, L44A, I47A, M50A, and L51A, proposed to lie on the interior face of the helix (18Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), are gain of function mutants. We propose that gain of function is a direct consequence of enhanced monomer formation. The 2.5-fold increase in inhibitory function that accompanies the 3–4-fold enhancement of monomer formation provides kinetic evidence that PLN monomers are the functional inhibitory form, while PLN pentamers represent a noninhibitory or less inhibitory reservoir. In chemical terms, the concentration of PLN monomers, a function of the dissociation constant of the PLN pentamer, will be a key determinant of the concentration of the inhibited PLN monomer·SERCA2a complex ([MS]) and of the degree of SERCA2a inhibition. We tested the hypothesis that loss of function PLN mutants, with nonfunctional substitutions at specific sites that are essential for interaction with SERCA2a, would be dominant over gain of function mutants, activated by an increase in their monomer concentration, by creating double mutants. In agreement with our hypothesis, the double mutants N34A/I40A and F35A/L44A were found to be virtually inactive (Fig. 1 A), even though both were monomeric (Fig.1 C). The mutants form monomers, they may form PLN monomer·SERCA2a complexes, but inhibitory interactions clearly do not occur in the complexes. Although loss of PLN function is likely to result from disruption of interactions between amino acids in transmembrane helices of PLN and SERCA2a, as proposed, it is also possible that it could result from pentamer stabilization. Data in Table I illustrate that the loss of function mutants, N34A, I38A, V49A and L52A, formed slightly more stable pentamers, in line with their loss of function. The mutant I45A also formed more stable pentamers, however, and function was not altered in this case. These discrepancies will, no doubt, be clarified by further study of the subtleties of the formation of the PLN monomer·SERCA2a complex and the formation of inhibitory interactions within the complex. Gain of inhibitory function might occur through transmembrane or cytoplasmic interaction sites or both. Gain of function was first observed in studies involving coexpression of SERCA2a with PLN domain II constructs to which NH2-terminal, cytoplasmic epitopes such as PLN1–20 or hemagglutinin were fused (8Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An examination of Fig. 2B in Ref. 8 shows that PLN1–20-PLN30–52 was a Class 3 mutant that gained function, while Flag-PLN25–52 was a Class 2 mutant with unaltered function. These observations suggest that at least one form of gain of function results from PLN domain II interactions with SERCA2a. As a further test of this hypothesis, we constructed the Met-PLN28–52 mutant, L37A, to increase the probability that this simple domain II construct would be maximally monomeric, in line with structural predictions for the PLN transmembrane domain. The L37A mutation enhanced the inhibitory properties of Met-PLN28–52 from ΔK Ca of about −0.17 pCa units (8Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to ΔK Ca of about −0.3 pCa units (data not shown). We conclude that gain of inhibitory function can be accomplished with only the transmembrane domain of PLN, but we recognize that other means of increasing the concentration of the inhibited PLN monomer·SERCA2a complex would also result in gain of function. Fig. 3 illustrates our model for PLN interaction with SERCA2a. We deduce that PLN monomers (M) are the functional species and that their dissociation from pentamers (P) is an essential step in SERCA2a (S) inhibition by PLN. The fact that PLN is about 25% depolymerized under normal conditions implies that PLN monomers are normally in relatively abundant supply. The dissociation constants for both the PLN pentamer (K d 1) and the PLN monomer/SERCA2a heterodimer (K d 2) will control both the PLN monomer concentration [M] and the concentration of the monomer-inhibited form of SERCA2a [MS], defined as follows.P ↔Kd1 5M (Kd1=[P]/[M] 5)Equation 1 M+S ↔Kd2 MS (Kd2=[MS]/[M][S])Equation 2 The base line of inhibition of wild type SERCA2a by wild type PLN will be proportional to [MS], but [MS] can be altered by mutations or by physiological perturbations. Mutations that enhance PLN monomer formation will alter K d 1 and increase both [M] and [MS]. Mutations that increase the affinity of the interaction between M and S will alterK d 2 and increase [MS], while mutations that decrease affinity will decrease [MS].

Our observations have important physiological and medical relevance. If mutations of Phe32, Ile33, Leu37, Ile40, Leu43, Leu44, Ile47, Met50, and Leu51 were to occur naturally, we predict that they would increase [MS] to levels that would inhibit Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm of myocardial cells. Although other Ca2+ removal systems might compensate (24Odermatt A. Taschner P.E.M. Khanna V.K. Busch H.F.M. Karpati G. Jablecki C.K. Breuning M.H. MacLennan D.H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we predict that the resulting disruption in Ca2+ regulation would lead to cardiomyopathy. We also predict that any mutations in the PLN transmembrane helix, in SERCA2a transmembrane helices, or elsewhere in PLN or SERCA2a, that would increase the affinity between M and S, would also increase [MS], leading to gain of PLN inhibitory function and to cardiomyopathy.

https://openalex.org/W2074760277,"Most natural actions are accomplished with a seamless combination of individual movements. Such coordination poses a problem: How does the motor system orchestrate multiple movements to produce a single goal-directed action? The results from current experiments suggest one possible solution. Oculomotor neurons in the superior colliculus of a primate responded to mismatches between eye and target positions, even when the animal made two different types of eye movements. This neuronal activity therefore does not appear to convey a command for a specific type of eye movement but instead encodes an error signal that could be used by multiple movements. The use of shared inputs is one possible strategy for ensuring that different movements share a common goal."
https://openalex.org/W1999375826,"Following genomic damage, the cessation of DNA replication is co-ordinated with onset of DNA repair; this co-ordination is essential to avoid mutation and genomic instability. To investigate these phenomena, we have analysed proteins that interact with PCNA, which is required for both DNA replication and repair. One such protein is p21Cip1, which inhibits DNA replication through its interaction with PCNA, while allowing repair to continue. We have identified an interaction between PCNA and the structure specific nuclease, Fen1, which is involved in DNA replication. Deletion analysis suggests that p21Cip1 and Fen1 bind to the same region of PCNA. Within Fen1 and its homologues a small region (10 amino acids) is sufficient for PCNA binding, which contains an 8 amino acid conserved PCNA-binding motif. This motif shares critical residues with the PCNA-binding region of p21Cip1. A PCNA binding peptide from p21Cip1 competes with Fen1 peptides for binding to PCNA, disrupts the Fen1-PCNA complex in replicating cell extracts, and concomitantly inhibits DNA synthesis. Competition between homologous regions of Fen1 and p21Cip1 for binding to the same site on PCNA may provide a mechanism to co-ordinate the functions of PCNA in DNA replication and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2087460037,"Transposable elements of the mariner/Tc1 family are postulated to have spread by horizontal transfer and be relatively independent of host-specific factors. This was tested by introducing the Drosophila mauritiana element mariner into the human parasite Leishmania major, a trypanosomatid protozoan belonging to one of the most ancient eukaryotic lineages. Transposition in Leishmania was efficient, occurring in more than 20 percent of random transfectants, and proceeded by the same mechanism as in Drosophila. Insertional inactivation of a specific gene was obtained, and a modified mariner element was used to select for gene fusions, establishing mariner as a powerful genetic tool for Leishmania and other organisms. These experiments demonstrate the evolutionary range of mariner transposition in vivo and underscore the ability of this ubiquitous DNA to parasitize the eukaryotic genome."
https://openalex.org/W1582386710,"Recent studies have described a widely expressed adaptor-like complex, named AP-3, which is likely involved in protein sorting in exocytic/endocytic pathways. The AP-3 complex is composed of four distinct subunits. Here, we report the identification of one of the subunits of this complex, which we call β3A-adaptin. The predicted amino acid sequence of β3A-adaptin reveals that the protein is closely related to the neuron-specific protein β-NAP (61% overall identity) and more distantly related to the β1- and β2-adaptin subunits of the clathrin-associated adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2, respectively.

Cytosolic protein coats function as mediators of vesicle budding and selection of cargo molecules at different stages of the secretory and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar and 2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Among the various protein coats that have been described to date, those containing the protein clathrin are the most extensively characterized (reviewed in Refs. 3Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Kirchhausen T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 182-188Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Clathrin coats are found in association with the cytosolic aspect of the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane, and with coated vesicles that originate from these organelles. In addition to clathrin, these coats contain specific protein complexes known as adaptors or APs. One of these adaptors, AP-1, is a component of trans-Golgi network clathrin coats and consists of four subunits: γ- and β1-adaptins (∼100 kDa), μ1 (∼47 kDa), and ς1 (∼19 kDa). Another adaptor, AP-2, is associated with plasma membrane clathrin coats and is also composed of four subunits: α- and β2-adaptins (∼100 kDa), μ2 (∼50 kDa), and ς2 (∼17 kDa). The analogous subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 display significant homology to each other; in addition, the adaptor complexes themselves exhibit a similar overall structure of a “head” with two protruding “ears,” each separated from the head by a flexible “hinge” (3Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Kirchhausen T.

A major function of AP-1 and AP-2 is to link clathrin lattices to the corresponding membranes. This role is fulfilled by the γ- and β1-adaptin subunits of AP-1 and the α- and β2-adaptin subunits of AP-2 (6Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol.

In the past few years, it has become clear that the structure and function of clathrin coats serve as paradigms for other protein coats. Indeed, some subunits of the non-clathrin coat, COPI, are structurally related to subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 (23Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E.

In addition, recent studies have identified other mammalian proteins that display significant homology to AP-1 and AP-2 subunits and are components of previously unknown coats. Pevsner et al. (27Pevsner J. Volknandt W. Wong B.R. Scheller R.H.

Some of these subunits are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell lines (p47A, ς3A, and ς3B), while others are only expressed in brain, spinal cord, and neuronal cell lines (p47B and β-NAP). Not surprisingly, these homologs of AP-1 and AP-2 subunits were found to exist as heterotetrameric assemblies resembling adaptor complexes (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E.

West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A similar complex, which was named AP-3, is expressed in all cells examined to date and contains subunits of ∼160, ∼140, ∼47, and ∼22 kDa (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The ∼47-kDa protein corresponds to p47A while the ∼22-kDa protein is either ς3A or ς3B. The ∼140-kDa subunit of this complex is immunologically related to the neuronal protein β-NAP but distinct from it based on its expression in various non-neuronal cell lines (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the cloning of a novel cDNA encoding the ∼140-kDa subunit of the ubiquitous AP-3 complex. This protein, referred to as β3A-adaptin, is closely related to β-NAP and displays significant homology to β1- and β2-adaptins. Consistent with it being a subunit of the ubiquitous AP-3 complex, β3A-adaptin is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell lines. Biochemical analyses show that β3A-adaptin is phosphorylated on serine residuesin vivo and is absent from clathrin-coated vesicles. The similarity of β3A-adaptin to β1- and β2-adaptins lends support to the idea that AP-3 is structurally and functionally related to AP-1 and AP-2, and that it is likewise involved in the regulation of intracellular protein trafficking. Two EST clones (GenBank accession codes R02669 and T98538) from human fetal liver/spleen (Washington University-Merck EST Project) were found to encode portions of a novel protein with significant homology to β-NAP. Based on these partial sequences, a full-length cDNA encoding this protein, named β3A-adaptin, was isolated from a Marathon-Ready™ human pancreas cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by a combination of 5′- and 3′-RACE 1The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; kb, kilobase pair(s). PCR, using the Advantage™ cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH). The specific primers used in a first and second (nested) 5′-RACE reactions were complementary to nucleotides 3181–3205 and 2955–2981 of the β3A-adaptin cDNA, respectively. The first and second (nested) primers used for 3′-RACE PCR corresponded to nucleotides 1773–1800 and 1898–1922 of the full-length cDNA, respectively. Both 5′ and 3′ nested PCR products were cloned into the pNoTA/T7 shuttle vector (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Several independent clones were isolated and sequenced to guard against errors introduced by the DNA polymerase during PCR amplification. Both strands were sequenced by the dideoxy method. The sources and culture conditions for all the human cell lines used in this study are described elsewhere (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out as described before (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The β3A-adaptin probe was obtained by PCR using a 5′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 1898–1922 and a 3′ primer complementary to nucleotides 2955–2981 of the full-length cDNA, respectively. The probe used for detecting the β-NAP mRNA consisted of a 450-base pair fragment which was PCR-amplified from the EST clone 165789 (Washington University-Merck EST Project) using 5′ and 3′ primers corresponding to nucleotides 2000–2028 and 2424–2449 of the full-length β-NAP cDNA (GenBank accession number: U37673), respectively. The above sets of primers were also used for RT-PCR analysis of the expression of β3A-adaptin and β-NAP mRNAs in cell lines; the analysis was performed by using the Gene Amp® XL RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer, Branchburg, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare a series of GST fusion proteins bearing different segments of β3A-adaptin, the corresponding cDNA fragments were engineered by PCR to be cloned in-frame into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The β3A-adaptin cDNA segments corresponding to amino acids 1–287, 1–642, and 810–1094 were cloned into theEcoRI-NotI cloning sites of the vector, while the segment encoding amino acids 643–809 was cloned into theBamHI-NotI sites of the vector. The DNA sequence of all the constructs was confirmed by manual sequencing. Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells and then affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Monoclonal anti-α-adaptin antibody 100/2 was obtained from Sigma. The preparation and purification of polyclonal rabbit antibodies to p47 (A and B) and ς3 (A and B) were described previously (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W.

The preparation of an antiserum against a GST fusion protein that bears the hinge region of β-NAP (GST-β-NAP647–796) has also been described previously (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E.

Here, this antiserum was passed through a column containing GST coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad), to remove anti-GST antibodies, and then affinity-purified (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using as a ligand a peptide comprising residues 647–796 of β-NAP. The purified antibody, herein referred to as β3H1, recognizes the hinge region of both β-NAP and β3A-adaptin, as inferred from immunoprecipitation experiments with the corresponding fragments translated in vitro. The β3H7 antibody was raised in rabbits by immunization with the GST-β3A643–809 fusion protein. The antibody was affinity-purified using as a ligand the same fusion protein coupled to Affi-Gel-15 beads, and was subsequently immunoabsorbed with GST, followed by GST-β-NAP647–796 to obtain a monospecific antibody to the hinge region of β3A-adaptin. The lack of cross-reactivity between the β3H7 antibody and β-NAP was corroborated by immunoprecipitation experiments and by immunoblotting. The β3A1 and β3C1 antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with GST-β3A1–642 and GST-β3A810–1094fusion proteins, followed by affinity purification on immobilized GST-β3A1–287 and GSTβ3A810–1094, respectively. Both antibodies were absorbed with GST. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to BSA (Cappel, Cochranville, PA) or to the FLAG epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as irrelevant antibody controls. The preparation of an antibody to human δ-adaptin is described elsewhere. 2C. E. Ooi, J. E. Moreira, E. C. Dell'Angelica, G. Poy, D. Wassarman, and J. S. Bonifacino, submitted for publication. Metabolic labeling of M1 cells with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation-recapture experiments, and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The subunits of the AP-3 complex were isolated from [35S]methionine-labeled M1 cells by immunoprecipitation-recapture (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mm EDTA and divided into two aliquots. One of the aliquots was treated with 1 milliunit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C; the other one was mock-treated. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) followed by fluorography. M1 cells were grown to almost confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 9% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were detached from the plates by treatment with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mmHEPES, collected by low-speed centrifugation, and then washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, cells were suspended in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mmHEPES, 0.1% BSA containing 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After the incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride, and then lysed by incubation for 15 min on ice with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm iodoacetamide, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Immunoprecipitation of the AP-3 complex with an anti-ς3 antibody, dissociation of the complex, and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the subunits with specific antibodies were carried out as described previously (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of metabolically 32P-labeled β3A-adaptin was performed by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis (34Siegel J.N. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 11.2.1-11.2.17Google Scholar). The preparation of cytosol from M1 cells and its fractionation by gel filtration were performed as described previously (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). For isolation of the complex by affinity chromatography, the cytosol was passed through a Protein A-Sepharose column (1.6 ml) and then loaded onto a 0.4-ml column containing 0.7 mg of purified anti-ς3 antibody which had been covalently coupled to Protein A-Sepharose (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.1m glycine (pH 2.5). A crude membrane fraction and purified clathrin-coated vesicles from bovine brain were the kind gift of Lois Greene and Evan Eisenberg (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health). Our previous work demonstrated the existence in non-neuronal cells of a protein immunologically related to the neuronal β-NAP (30Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To identify this protein, we searched EST data bases for β-NAP homologs. Two EST clones from human fetal liver/spleen were found to encode a novel protein with significant homology to β-NAP. The complete cDNA was obtained using 5′- and 3′-RACE procedures based on partial sequences of the EST clones. Analysis of the sequence of this 3950-base pair cDNA revealed a long open reading frame encoding a protein of 1094 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 121,350 Da. The protein displayed significant homology not only to β-NAP (Fig. 1), but also to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII open reading frame YGR261c and to mammalian β1- and β2-adaptins (Fig. 2). The new human protein was named β3A-adaptin.Figure 2Comparison of the sequence of β3A-adaptin with those of other coat proteins. A, Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot of human β3A-adaptin. The sequence of β3A-adaptin was divided into three regions based on the hydropathy profile and the degree of identity to analogous regions in other adaptins. The three regions were designated A (amino-terminal), H(hinge), and C (carboxyl-terminal).

This structure is reminiscent of the domain organization of other adaptins (3Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Kirchhausen T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 182-188Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The homology of β3A-adaptin to β-NAP extends over the entire length of their polypeptide chains (Fig. 1), although the degree of sequence similarity varies in the three regions (Fig. 2 B). The percentage of conserved amino acid residues shared by the two proteins is highest in the A region; this region also exhibits the highest degree of similarity to the S. cerevisiae YGR261c protein and to the mammalian β-adaptins (Fig. 2 B). In the β1- and β2-adaptins, the amino-terminal segment corresponds to a “head” or “core” domain of the proteins where interactions with the other adaptor subunits are thought to take place. The head domains of β1-adaptin, β2-adaptin, and β-NAP have been shown to contain up to 14 Arm repeats (35Küssel O. Frasch M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1491-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Traub L.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 43-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a degenerate motif that probably functions as a protein-protein interaction element. Analysis of the β3A-adaptin sequence reveals that this protein also contains 12 or 13 Arm repeats in the A region (not shown). The H region of β3A-adaptin is strongly hydrophilic and rich in acidic residues (31%) and serine residues (26%) (Fig. 1). This region contains many potential sites for phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinases casein kinase I and casein kinase II (21 and 25 sites, respectively; Refs. 37Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar and 38Hardie, G., and Hanks, S. (eds) (1995) The Protein Kinase Facts Book: Protein Serine Kinases, pp. 240-242, Academic Press, LondonGoogle Scholar). The H region of β3A-adaptin is 35 and 19% identical to the analogous regions in β-NAP and YGR261c, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Although the percentage of identical residues is lower in this region, as compared with the A region, the general characteristics of the sequence (i.e. high content of acidic and serine residues) are conserved among these proteins. No significant homology to mammalian β-adaptins was observed in this region, although the analogous segment in β1- and β2-adaptins is also hydrophilic and displays a hinge-like structure. Finally, the C region of β3A-adaptin is 50% identical to the homologous segment of β-NAP but shows no significant homology to β1- and β2-adaptins and is absent from YGR261c (Fig.2 B). In the β-adaptins, this segment corresponds to the “ear” or “appendage” domain. A philogenetic tree constructed with the above sequences and that of the more distantly related COPI subunit, β-COP, (Fig. 2 C) shows that β3A-adaptin, β-NAP, and YGR261c all belong to a group that may have diverged from the others early in the evolution of the family. The mammalian β1 and β2-adaptins, a D. melanogaster β-adaptin and two other S. cerevisiaeadaptins (Sc ADB1 and Sc ADB2) cluster together in a separate branch. The β-COPs from rat, fly, and yeast are distantly related to the members of the other two groups. Thus, these sequence analyses define a group of proteins (β3A-adaptin, β-NAP, and YGR261c) that are more closely related to clathrin-associated β-adaptins than to COPI components. The pattern of expression of the β3A-adaptin mRNA in various human tissues and cell lines was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig.3). A single ∼4.2-kb β3A-adaptin message was detected in all tissues examined (Fig. 3 A), as well as in both non-neuronal (M1, HeLa, and RD4) and neuronal cell lines (H4, SK-N-SH, SK-N-MC, and Ntera-2) (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the β3A-adaptin mRNA, the β-NAP mRNA is known to be expressed only in brain (Ref. 28Newman L.S. McKeever M.O. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Cell. 1995; 82: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and data not shown). Northern analyses of various cell lines detected expression of the β-NAP mRNA only in the neuronal precursor line Ntera-2 (Fig. 3 B). Additional analyses by RT-PCR, which is more sensitive than Northern analysis, revealed the presence of small amounts of β-NAP mRNA in other neuronal cells but not in non-neuronal cells (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the β3A-adaptin mRNA is widely expressed, whereas expression of the β-NAP mRNA is restricted to brain and cell lines of neuronal origin. To characterize the biochemical properties of the β3A-adaptin protein, we raised antibodies to different regions of the molecule. The antibodies were affinity-purified and used to identify the protein by Western blot analysis of the human fibroblast cell line M1, which expresses the β3A-adaptin mRNA but not the β-NAP mRNA (Fig.3). Antibodies to both the H and C regions of β3A-adaptin (β3H7 and β3C1, respectively) were found to recognize a protein that migrated as"

To assess whether all four stimuli promote phosphorylation of the cotransport protein and whether this phosphorylation is catalyzed by the same kinase, the cotransporter was isolated from erythrocytes by immunoprecipitation and its pattern of phosphorylation was evaluated. Each stimulus evoked proportionate increases in cotransporter activity and phosphorylation. No two stimuli in combination evoked greater activation and phosphorylation than did the more potent of the two stimuli acting alone. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the cotransport protein indicated that phosphorylation occurs at serine and threonine residues. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed a distinctive pattern of 8 major tryptic phosphopeptides, none of which were significantly phosphorylated in the unstimulated state. Maps of cotransporters activated by the four different stimuli were indistinguishable. Measurements of phosphorylation stoichiometry indicated that each cotransporter acquires ∼5 phosphates on going from an inactive state in swollen cells to an active state in shrunken cells. Staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor with broad selectivity, inhibited each stimulus equipotently (IC50 ∼ 0.7 μm). Staurosporine promptly reversed cotransporter activity and phosphorylation when added to shrinkage-stimulated but not to calyculin-stimulated cells, indicating that it enters the cell rapidly and blocks phosphorylation. These results suggest that cell shrinkage, cAMP, fluoride, and calyculin-A promote the phosphorylation of the Na-K-Cl cotransport protein at a similar constellation of serine and threonine residues.

Na-K-Cl cotransport is regulated by numerous first and second messengers through a complex and cell-specific interplay of stimulatory and inhibitory signals (1Palfrey H.C. O'Donnell M.E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 2: 293-307Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which cell surface receptors, cell volume, cytosolic chloride, cytoskeletal architecture, and proliferative status modulate cotransport activity remain unknown. Early recognition that ion movement by the Na-K-Cl cotransporter, although energetically passive (2Geck P. Pietrzyk C. Burckhardt B.-C. Pfeiffer B. Heinz E. Biochim. Biophys.

Physiol. 1993; 101: 733-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) might influence cotransport activity. Duck erythrocytes have long served as a premier model of electroneutral ion transport by virtue of their simplicity, uniformity, and ease of experimental manipulation. These cells manifest robust Na-K-Cl cotransport in response to four types of stimuli: osmotic cell shrinkage, elevated cytosolic cAMP (norepinephrine), Ser-Thr phosphatase inhibitors (calyculin-A, okadaic acid, endothall thioanhydride, fluoride), and deoxygenation (24Palfrey H.C. Greengard P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 372: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Palfrey H.C. Strange K. Cellular and Molecular Physiology of Cell Volume Regulation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 201-214Google Scholar). Unlike other modes of stimulation, the norepinephrine response is associated with increases in cytoplasmic cAMP (24Palfrey H.C. Greengard P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 372: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (8Alper S.L. Beam K.G. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pewitt E.B. Hegde R.S. Haas M. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20747-20756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and can be blocked by kinase inhibitors like K-252a and H-9 at doses that disable cAMP-dependent protein kinase in intact avian erythrocytes (11Pewitt E.B. Hegde R.S. Haas M. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20747-20756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same kinase inhibitors also block activation of cotransport by cell shrinkage, fluoride, and okadaic acid, but only at concentrations an order of magnitude higher (11Pewitt E.B. Hegde R.S. Haas M. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20747-20756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the avian erythrocyte Na-K-Cl cotransporter is regulated by at least two kinases, one of which is cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The fact that K252a blocks activation by cell shrinkage, fluoride, and okadaic acid at a similar high dose raises the possibility that non-cAMP-dependent stimuli are transduced by the same kinase (25Palfrey H.C. Strange K. Cellular and Molecular Physiology of Cell Volume Regulation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 201-214Google Scholar). While cotransport activity appears to determined by a dynamic competition between ongoing protein kinase and phosphatase activities, a key question is whether all modes of stimulation involve phosphorylation of the cotransport protein itself and whether different stimuli involve different kinases. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that four different modes of stimulation (cell shrinkage, cAMP, fluoride, and calyculin-A) involve phosphorylation of the cotransport protein at common sites. The recent advent of monoclonal antibodies capable of immunoprecipitating the Na-K-Cl cotransport protein from detergent extracts of 32P-labeled duck erythrocytes with high efficiency (26Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) now makes it possible to quantitatively compare the phosphorylation induced by different stimuli and to assess the physical disposition of phosphorylation sites. The results of this analysis suggest that all forms of activation promote phosphorylation of the cotransport protein at a common set of Ser/Thr sites. 86RbCl was obtained from DuPont NEN; staurosporine, calyculin-A, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP were from Biomol; ML-7 was from LC Laboratories; protease inhibitors were from Boehringer Mannheim; silica gel plates (5748-7) and polyethylamine-cellulose F TLC plates (5504) were from EM Reagents; thin layer cellulose sheets were from Eastman Kodak Co.

A monoclonal antibody (T14) directed against the carboxyl-terminal 310 amino acids of the human colonic Na-K-Cl cotransporter (hNKCC1) was developed as described previously (26Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T14 antibody detects 0.5 ng of duck erythrocyte cotransporter on Western blots using enhanced chemiluminescence (26Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitates the SDS-solubilized protein with >80% efficiency. Recognition of this protein by monoclonal antibodies T4 and T14 but not by T9 suggests that avian erythrocytes possess a homologue of the ubiquitous NKCC1 isoform. Hybridoma cells were grown in the ascites of pristane-primed severe combined immunodeficient mice (Taconic CB-17 Fox-Chase SCID). After clarification by centrifugation, the ascitic fluid was preserved by the addition of sodium azide (0.025%) and protease inhibitors (1.5 μm pepstatin A, 3.5 μm chymostatin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μm leupeptin, and 200 μm AEBSF) and stored at 4 °C. Blood was drawn from the brachial vein of female Pekin ducks (Anas platyrynchos) into heparinized syringes. After removal of plasma and buffy coat, the erythrocytes were stored in ice-cold DFS (146 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 0.1 mm Na2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 20 mg/liter penicillin, 45 mg/liter streptomycin, and 20 mm Na-TES, pH = 7.40 at 41 °C, 320 mosm) for up to 4 days with no apparent detrimental effect. Before use, the erythrocytes were incubated (2.5% hematocrit) for 45 min in fresh DFS at 41 °C to achieve a steady state with respect to ion and water contents. Intracellular water content, an index of cell volume, was measured by a gravimetric method. Duplicate aliquots of cell suspension (800 μl of 5% hematocrit) were added to baked microcentrifuge tubes of predetermined weight and centrifuged for 2 min at 5000 × g. After removal of the supernatant, the pellets were centrifuged again for 5 min at 12,000 × gat 4 °C. Fluid was removed from the pellet surface by capillary action using a small pointed swab. Each tube was then reweighed, dried in an oven at 85 °C for >18 h, and weighed again. Wet cell weight was corrected for an extracellular fluid weight of 2.5%. Duck erythrocytes (22 μl/sample) were incubated with gentle agitation in a siliconized flask (7% hematocrit, 41 °C) for 3 h in DFS containing 150 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Labeled cells were washed twice in ice-cold DFS and incubated (2.5% hematocrit, 41 °C) for 12 min in fresh DFS containing 50 μm ouabain and an activator of Na-K-Cl cotransport. After stimulation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (10 s, 6000 × g) and frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Cotransporter activity was assayed as the unidirectional influx of 86Rb, an ion that quantitatively substitutes for K+ in the cotransport process (27Schmidt III, W.F. McManus T.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 59-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were treated exactly as those employed for32P labeling to allow comparison between cotransporter activation and phosphorylation. Erythrocytes were then incubated in DFS (5% hematocrit, 41 °C) containing 50 μm ouabain and an activator of cotransport (10 μm norepinephrine, 100 mm sucrose, 10 mm sodium fluoride, or 200 nm calyculin-A) for 10 min, a period during which the effect of each activator becomes maximal and invariant.86Rb entry was initiated by the addition of isotope and terminated 1–4 min later by dilution with ice-cold “stop solution” (DFS containing 250 μm bumetanide). Extracellular86Rb was removed by washing the cells three times in stop solution. Intracellular and extracellular 86Rb was quantified by γ spectroscopy (Beckman). Influx assays were confined to an early period during which 86Rb accumulation was proportional to time. The portion of 86Rb influx attributable to cotransport was determined by subtraction of the component resistant to 100 μm bumetanide; this residual component averaged <5% of the stimulated rate and was unaffected by activators of cotransport. Frozen 32P-labeled cells were thawed in ice-cold AP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4EDTA, 15 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mmNa4-pyrophosphate, 20 mm Hepes, pH = 7.2). The lysed cells were washed in ice-cold AP buffer until pink in color and then solubilized in 200 μl of warm AP buffer containing 1% SDS by probe sonication (Fisher Sonic Dismembranator 50, setting 2, 20 s). After heating to 55 °C for 20 min, the SDS extract was diluted with 600 μl of ice-cold AP buffer containing 2.5% CHAPS, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm orthovanadate. After 90 min on ice, the extract was clarified by centrifugation (12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C) and incubated overnight on ice with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody T14. Immune complexes were collected on Protein G-Sepharose beads and rinsed four times with ice-cold AP buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, followed by one rinse with PBS. The immunoprecipitate was extracted into 70 μl of SDS-sample buffer (4% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12% glycerol, and 0.01% Serva Blue G) and electrophoretically separated on 7.5% Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed using x-ray film or a storage phosphor screen (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics). Western blot analysis indicated that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation from extracts of both resting and stimulated cells exceeded 80%. The32P content of ATP in KCO3-neutralized perchloric acid extracts of 32P-labeled cells was determined by ascending thin layer chromatography on polyethylamine-cellulose plates in 0.85 mKH2PO4 at pH 3.4 (29Cashel M. Lazzarini R.A. Kalbacher B. J. Chromatogr. 1969; 40: 103-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify [32P]ATP, discrete spots of radioactivity comigrating with [32P]ATP standards were scraped from the plate and analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy, correcting for a counting efficiency of 70% for [32P]ATP bound to cellulose (8Alper S.L. Beam K.G. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction of [γ-32P]ATP in extract [32P]ATP was measured as described by Mayer and Krebs (30Mayer S.E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3153-3160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A neutralized perchloric acid extract of labeled cells (20 mg) was applied to a column (5 × 40 mm) of Dowex 1-formate. The column was washed with 5 ml of 4 n formic acid, and ATP was eluted with 0.4 m ammonium formate in 4 nformic acid. The solution was lyophilized, dissolved in 300 μl of water, and lyophilized again. The dried material was dissolved in 450 μl of 100 mm imidazole (pH = 7.4) containing 1 μg of phenol red to confirm neutral pH. ATP was converted to glucose 6-phosphate by adding 10 mm glucose, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 50 μm cold ATP, and 5 units of yeast hexokinase, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The solution was then applied to a Dowex 1-formate column, and the column was washed with 5 ml of water. Glucose 6-phosphate was eluted with 2 n formic acid, after which residual [32P]ATP was eluted with 0.4m ammonium formate in 4 n formic acid. Both eluates were analyzed for 32P by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Parallel assays using known quantities of authentic [γ-32P]ATP provided correction factors for the yield of cellular ATP (∼85%) and for the efficiency of enzymatic formation and recovery of [32P]glucose 6-phosphate (∼77%). The ratio of [γ-32P]ATP to total [32P]ATP,i.e. the fraction of cellular [32P]ATP converted into [32P]glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase, was determined to be 0.82 ± 0.02 (mean ± S.D.,n = 3). The specific activity of cellular [γ-32P]ATP was calculated from the radioactivity of ATP in the extract, the [γ-32P]ATP:[32P]ATP ratio (0.82), the number of cells extracted (1.4 × 108), the water content of the duck erythrocyte (99.4 fl; Ref. 31Lytle, C. (1988) Na-K-2Cl and K-Cl Cotransport in Duck Red Cells. Ph.D. thesis, Duke University, Durham, NC.Google Scholar), and the concentration of ATP within the duck erythrocyte (3.3 mm; Ref. 7Palfrey H.C. Pewitt E.B. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 425: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cotransporter protein was isolated from 32P-labeled cells by immunoprecipitation, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane. Regions of PVDF containing [32P]cotransporter were located by autoradiography, excised, and hydrolyzed in 6 N hydrochloric acid at 100 °C for 3 h. The hydrolysate was lyophilized, reconstituted in 20 μl of water containing 10 μg of unlabeled phosphoamino acids, and separated by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis (600 V for 5 h at 4 °C) on a silica gel plate (Whatman 4410–221) in a buffer consisting of formic acid, acetic acid, and water (25:78:897). Phosphoamino acids were visualized by ninhydrin staining and autoradiography using a storage phosphor screen. Gel slices containing [32P]cotransporter were rinsed thoroughly with water, then treated with 15 mm N-chlorosuccinimide for 20 min at 23 °C to selectively cleave tryptophanyl peptide bonds (32Lischwe M.A. Ochs D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments were separated on a 7.5% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and those containing 32P were detected by autoradiography using a storage phosphor screen. Gel slices containing [32P]cotransporter were rinsed thoroughly with water and equilibrated with 200 mmNH4HCO3. The gel pieces were then rotated with 500 μl of 200 mm NH4HCO3containing 100 μg of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin for 24 h at 37 °C, with the addition of 50 μg of freshly prepared trypsin after 17 h. The digest was then subjected to three cycles of lyophilization and reconstitution in water (500 μl). The final residue was dissolved in 20 μl of electrophoresis buffer (10% acetic acid, 1% pyridine, pH 3.5) and spotted onto thin layer cellulose sheets along with marker dyes (xylene cyanol FF and phenol red, 2 μg each). Phosphopeptide maps were generated by electrophoresis at 500 V for ∼3 h followed by crossed ascending chromatography in 1-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:water (60:40:12:48). To ensure uniformity between different samples, electrophoresis and chromatography were allowed to continue until each marker dye had migrated a fixed distance. Phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography using a storage phosphor screen. Incubation of duck erythrocytes with [32P]orthophosphate resulted in a slow equilibration of32P into cellular ATP (Fig. 1). Half-maximal incorporation required ∼3 h, consistent with previous data on turkey erythrocytes (8Alper S.L. Beam K.G. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4864-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of extracts of cells labeled for 3 h revealed that 82 ± 2% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of the radioactivity in cellular [32P]ATP could be transferred in vitro to glucose by hexokinase, indicating that the predominant form of radioactive ATP at this point in the labeling process is [γ-32P]ATP. All experiments described hereafter were performed on erythrocytes that had been prelabeled with 32P for 3 h and then exposed for 9–12 min to an activator of cotransport and ouabain (to block the Na/K pump). During the activation period, changes in cellular [32P]ATP (measured chromatographically), water content (measured gravimetrically), and pH were negligible, in agreement with previous studies (7Palfrey H.C. Pewitt E.B. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 425: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Alper S.L. Beam K.G. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Cells were incubated with 150 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate at 41 °C for the indicated times. The specific activity of 32P in ATP was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent mean values ± S.D. from triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Four factors known to stimulate cotransport activity (hypertonicity, norepinephrine, fluoride, and calyculin-A) promoted incorporation of 32P into the cotransport protein (Fig. 2). Optimal phosphorylation was obtained with doses that evoke maximal cotransport activity: 10 μmnorepinephrine, 10 mm fluoride, 100 nmcalyculin-A, and 100 mm sucrose (25Palfrey H.C. Strange K. Cellular and Molecular Physiology of Cell Volume Regulation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 201-214Google Scholar). When added with the stimulus, 100 μm bumetanide abolished cotransporter activity but did not alter the rate or the extent of phosphorylation (data not shown); this observation supports the idea that cotransporter phosphorylation is the cause rather than the consequence of cotransport activity and excludes the possibility that bumetanide inhibits by blocking phosphorylation. The stimulatory effect of fluoride was not enhanced by the addition of 10 μm Al3+ nor diminished by the chelation of Al3+ with 1 mmdeferoxamine mesylate (data not shown), discounting the possibility that it is due to aluminofluoride (AlF4−) as proposed for rat parotid acinar cells (33Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21558-21563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of osmotically induced changes in cell volume on cotransporter activity and phosphorylation was measured on paired suspensions of duck erythrocytes. The conditions used for32P labeling (preincubation for 3 h at 10% hematocrit) had no significant effect on cell volume or on the cotransporter's subsequent responsiveness to various stimuli. In unstimulated cells, cotransporter activity remained low, averaging only 3–7% of maximal levels. Slight osmotic cell swelling, from 1.5 to 1.63 liters/kg of cell solid, caused a virtual cessation of cotransport activity and a slight reduction in cotransport protein phosphorylation (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Greater degrees of swelling, even to extreme prelytic dimensions, caused no further decrease in cotransporter phosphorylation. This residual phosphorylation persisted when the swollen erythrocytes were exposed for 12 min to 30 μm staurosporine, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor that rapidly abolishes cotransport activity (e.g. Figs.6, 7, 8). Together these results suggest that the cotransport protein possesses a minor subset of nonregulatory or inhibitory phosphorylation sites whose turnover is volume-independent and either staurosporine-insensitive or relatively slow.Figure 4Stoichiometry of Na-K-Cl cotransport protein phosphorylation as a function of cell volume. Erythrocytes were labeled with 32P for 3 h, then exposed to an isotonic (323 mosm), hypotonic (223 mosm), or hypertonic (410 mosm) medium. After 9 min, samples from each cell suspension were obtained for analysis of wet cell mass, dry cell mass, [32P]ATP, and [32P]cotransport protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as moles of 32P incorporated into each mole of cotransport protein versus cell water content (volume).

Addition of forskolin or prostaglandin E1, agents known to elevate platelet cAMP and calcium efflux, to platelets pre-labeled with [32P]PO4 resulted in the direct phosphorylation of platelet PMCA. Similarly, addition of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A to platelet plasma membranes resulted in a 1.4-fold stimulation of activity. Thus, the previously reported inhibition of platelet activation by elevated intracellular cAMP may be accomplished in part by stimulation of PMCA, likely resulting in a decrease in intracellular calcium.Treatment with thrombin evoked tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet PMCA, while PMCA from resting platelets exhibited little tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of platelet plasma membranes by pp60 src resulted in 75% inhibition of PMCA activity within 15 min. Similarly, membranes isolated from thrombin-treated platelets exhibited 40% lower PMCA activity than those from resting platelets. Phosphorylation of erythrocyte ghosts and purified PMCA by pp60 src also resulted in up to 75% inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity, and inhibition was correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation. Sequencing of a peptide obtained after32P labeling of purified erythrocyte PMCA in vitro showed that tyrosine 1176 of PMCA4b is phosphorylated by pp60 src. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet PMCA may serve as positive feedback to inhibit PMCA and increase intracellular calcium during platelet activation.

These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet PMCA may serve as positive feedback to inhibit PMCA and increase intracellular calcium during platelet activation. Ca2+ signaling is an integral component of activation in platelets (1Heemskerk J.W.M. Sage S.O. Platelets ( Edinb ). 1994; 5: 295-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The intracellular Ca2+ concentration is regulated by Ca2+-ATPases and Ca2+ channels located in both the plasma membrane and in the dense tubular system, a modified endoplasmic reticulum in the platelet (2Haynes D.H. Platelets ( Edinb .). 1993; 4: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Strong agonists such as thrombin promote release of Ca2+ from internal stores and influx through the plasma membrane. Conversely, platelet antagonists such as prostaglandin E1 that elevate platelet cAMP, reduce cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Since the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is the main agent of Ca2+ removal at resting Ca2+concentrations (2Haynes D.H. Platelets ( Edinb .). 1993; 4: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is a key point for regulation of platelet Ca2+ metabolism. The activity of PMCA has been shown to be activated by several mechanisms including Ca2+/calmodulin, protein kinases A and C, acidic phospholipids, and proteolytic attack (3Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In fact, Johnson et al. (4Johnson J.S. Nied L.E. Haynes D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed indirectly that cAMP increases the rate of Ca2+ extrusion in platelets. However, direct phosphorylation of the platelet PMCA has not been reported previously. In addition to increased cytosolic Ca2+, platelet activation is also accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including focal adhesion kinase (pp125 FAK) and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase pp60 src followed by their association with the cytoskeleton (5Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20075-20081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shattil S.J. Haimovich B. Cunningham M. Lipfert L. Parson J.T. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ appears to be intimately involved in both tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangement in the platelet (7Dash D. Aepfelbacher M. Siess W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that the IP3 receptor can be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues leading to increased release of Ca2+ from internal stores (8Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We report here that tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA inhibits its activity further enhancing generation of the calcium signal. In the present work we have assessed direct phosphorylation of platelet PMCA in vivo after exposure to thrombin, an agonist, or prostaglandin E1, an antagonist. In addition, the effects of both cAMP-dependent and tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation of platelet PMCA in vitro on Ca2+-ATPase activity were measured. Finally, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of erythrocyte PMCA was used to determine the phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Purified erythrocyte PMCA was used as a model for platelet PMCA since we demonstrate in this work that the platelet contains the same isoforms of PMCA as found in the erythrocyte, PMCA1 and PMCA4 (9Stauffer T.P.

Endoproteinase Lys-C was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Purified recombinant pp60 src and protein phosphatase type 2A were products from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Platelet plasma membranes were prepared by the glycerol lysis method described by Harmon et al. (12Harmon J.T. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), except that membranes from lysed platelets were separated on a sucrose step gradient (33 and 66% w/v) in a Beckman SW-28 rotor at 26,000 rpm for 5 h (13Dean W.L. Quinton T.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Membranes collected at the 0–33% sucrose interface were concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, resuspended in 0.01 m TES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1m KCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Erythrocyte ghosts were obtained from washed cells by hypertonic lysis according to Steck and Kant (14Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Final membrane pellets were suspended in 0.01 m TES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mKCl, and 20% (w/v) glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Calmodulin-free erythrocyte ghosts were prepared from outdated whole blood and PMCA purified by calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography according to the method of Niggli et al. (15Niggli V. Adunyah E.S. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 395-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final preparation exhibited a major band at ∼140 kDa and a minor band at ∼100 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The specific activity of the purified material was 3.8 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg, and a 2.2-fold stimulation of activity was obtained with 50 nm calmodulin at 10 μm Ca2+. Purified PMCA was frozen and stored at −70 °C. Ca2+-ATPase activity was assayed using a system in which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to NADH oxidation by pyruvate kinase using phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase (16Dean W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Purified erythrocyte PMCA was assayed in 0.01m TES buffer at pH 7.2 containing 20 mm HEPES buffer, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 50 nm calmodulin, 2.1 mm CaCl2, 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml Triton X-100, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, and the coupled assay components. The difference in the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of 10 mm EGTA was used to calculate the Ca2+-ATPase activity. Assay of erythrocyte ghosts and platelet plasma membranes was performed in 0.01 m TES buffer at pH 7.5, containing 0.1m KCl, 5 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.01 mm CaCl2, and coupled assay components. Platelet concentrates (5 × 1010 cells/ml) in citrate anticoagulant were centrifuged at 5,000 × gand resuspended in the same volume of Tyrode's buffer (2 ml) containing 10 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4, 0.1 mmaspirin, 0.2 units/ml apyrase, and 2 mm EGTA. [32P]Na3PO4 (0.2 mCi) was added, and the platelets were gently mixed for 2 h at room temperature. At the end of the incubation period, the labeled platelets were pelleted at 5,000 × g for 3 min and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing the same added components used for32P labeling except that EGTA was omitted when prostaglandin E1 (5 μm) or forskolin (1 mm) was added. After a 2-min incubation period at room temperature, the platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × gfor 3 min and were solubilized with 250 μl of 0.4% Triton X-100 (w/v) containing 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C with incubation on a rotary mixing device. After incubation for 1 h, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. To detect insoluble PMCA, the pellet was solubilized with 100 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS and diluted 4-fold with the above solubilization buffer. Nonspecific material was then removed from both the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions by incubation for 30 min with 20 μg of mouse IgG and 50 μl of protein A-agarose. After removal of the protein A-agarose by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min, 40 μl of polyclonal anti-PMCA was added followed by 2 h of incubation. Protein A-agarose (50 μl) was then added and incubation continued for an additional 1.5 h. The protein A-PMCA complex was then collected by centrifugation for 3 min at 1,000 ×g, followed by washing with 200 μl of solubilization buffer two times and centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min. A final wash with 10 mm Tris/0.15 m NaCl was followed by addition of Laemmli sample dilution buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and incubation at 40 °C for 20 min. Samples were frozen at −20 °C or electrophoresed immediately. Detection of immunoprecipitated PMCA was accomplished by Western blotting as described below. The presence of32P in immunoprecipitated PMCA was measured by phosphorimaging using a Molecular Dynamics model PSF PhosphorImager with ImageQuant version 3.3 software. Proteins were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V in Tris/glycine buffer at pH 8.3 containing 10% methanol. After transfer, the blots were washed in TTBS (30 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 1 mm sodium o-vanadate) and blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk dissolved in this same TTBS solution. After washing two times in TTBS for 10 min, primary antibody dissolved at the appropriate dilution in TTBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was incubated with the membrane for 1 h. The membrane was washed one time for 15 min and four times for 5 min in TTBS and then exposed to the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:20,000 for 1 h. The membranes were washed as described after the primary antibody incubation and exposed to chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. PMCA was assessed using 5F10 (anti-PMCA), phosphotyrosine with PY20 (anti-phosphotyrosine), and specific isoforms of PMCA with anti-PMCA 1N, 2N, 3N, and 4N (9Stauffer T.P. Guerinin D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In some experiments membranes were stripped of bound antibody and probed with a different primary antibody after incubation of the membrane in 62.5 mm Tris at pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C for 1 h. The blot was then washed with TTBS, and the Western blotting procedure was repeated. The mass of PMCA present was determined by Western blotting known amounts of pure erythrocyte PMCA on the same gel with unknowns followed by ECL-based immunodetection and quantitation of scans of the resulting lumigrams using SigmaGel software. Purified erythrocyte PMCA was phosphorylated with pp60 src (0.4 units pp60 src /μg PMCA) at 30 °C in 5 mg/ml Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.2, 130 mm NaCl, 31 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 23 mm MnCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine. Reactions were terminated by rapid chromatography (5 min) of 50-μl assay mixtures on 5-ml Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mmCaCl2, 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml Triton X-100, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine to remove the sodium orthovanadate, which is an inhibitor of PMCA. The eluate was then assayed immediately for Ca2+-ATPase activity. Erythrocyte and platelet plasma membranes were phosphorylated with 0.3 unit of pp60 src /μg of membrane protein at room temperature in 10 mm Tris at pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of pepstatin A, antipain, and leupeptin. After the specified incubation time, vanadate was removed by centrifugation of the membranes (50 μl) in a Beckman Airfuge at 100,000 × g for 3 min, followed by resuspension in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris at pH 7.2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (w/v) glycerol and recentrifugation for 3 min. The final washed pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the centrifugation buffer and assayed immediately for Ca2+-ATPase activity. Large scale labeling of purified erythrocyte PMCA was carried out to identify peptides containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Approximately 1 nmol of PMCA in 350 μl was labeled with 90 units of pp60 src overnight at room temperature in 5 mg/ml Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.2, 130 mm NaCl, 31 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP at a specific activity of 2.5 μCi/nmol, 2.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine. The labeled protein was applied to two SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained briefly with 1% (w/v) aqueous Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein bands. The 140-kDa PMCA band was excised, dried, and stored at 4 °C. Peptide mapping and isolation by HPLC and automated sequence analyses were performed by the University of Kentucky Macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility as follows. 32P-Labeled PMCA bound to polyvinylidene difluoride was reduced with 7 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm Tris at pH 8.5 for 1 h at 37 °C and then alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. The reduced and alkylated protein was then digested with endoproteinase Lys-C in 100 mm Tris at pH 8.5 containing 1% (w/v) hydrogenated Triton X-100 and 10% CH3CN for 18 h at 37 °C. Released peptides were recovered in 40% (v/v) CH3CN at 37 °C for 30 min and then pooled with a wash of 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 40% CH3CN. Reverse phase HPLC was performed on a Vydac C18 TP silica column with a pellicular C18 guard column. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm with a mobile phase of 0.06% trifluoroacetic acidversus 0.054% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% CH3CN. Fractions were collected and counted without scintillation fluid. The appropriate fractions were pooled, applied to a precycled polybrene-coated glass fiber disc, and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer with pulsed liquid phase chemistry and on-line PTH-derivative analysis. The work of Johnson et al. (4Johnson J.S. Nied L.E. Haynes D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an increase in platelet cAMP results in increased efflux of Ca2+, suggesting that the platelet PMCA is stimulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. Neyses et al.(18Neyses L. Reinlib L. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10283-10287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that both sarcolemmal and erythrocyte PMCAs are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase resulting in stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity. Furthermore, Johnson and Haynes (19Johnson J.S. Haynes D.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that the Na-Ca2+ exchanger makes a negligible contribution to platelet calcium efflux at resting calcium concentrations, thus implying that the main effect of cAMP on platelet Ca2+ efflux is on PMCA. Consequently, we attempted to demonstrate that elevated cAMP leads to direct phosphorylation of PMCA in the platelet. The result of increasing cytosolic platelet cAMP with prostaglandin E1 or forskolin is shown in Fig. 1. Platelets were labeled with [32P]PO4 and then treated with forskolin or prostaglandin E1 prior to immunoprecipitation of PMCA. The results demonstrate that both agents cause a significant increase in incorporation of 32P, presumably resulting from cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. The effect of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation on Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined using purified platelet plasma membranes. Addition of protein phosphatase type 2A inhibited Ca2+-ATPase activity, and subsequent addition of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in 1.4-fold stimulation (Table I). These results confirm that platelet PMCA can be stimulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and show that the protein in isolated membranes is partially phosphorylated. Studies presented in a later section demonstrate that PMCA1 and -4 are the two isoforms present in human platelets, and these are most likely PMCA1b and -4b.Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of PMCA from resting platelets. Platelets (1.5 ml of a suspension containing 5 × 1010 cells/ml) resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing aspirin, apyrase, and prostaglandin E1 were solubilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 containing EGTA and protease inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures”). After centrifugation at 16,000 ×g, the Triton-insoluble material was solubilized in 1% SDS and diluted 4-fold with Triton solubilization buffer. PMCA was then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-PMCA, and the protein A-PMCA complex was solubilized in SDS and electrophoresed; Western blotting was then performed with anti-PMCA 5F10. Antibody binding was visualized by chemiluminescence. PMCA indicates a lane loaded with 1.0 μg of purified erythrocyte PMCA, and cytoskeletonindicates the lane containing the immunoprecipitate from the Triton-insoluble fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of platelet PMCA in vivo.

The immunoprecipitates were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane.

During platelet activation, several proteins become specifically phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and associate with the platelet cytoskeleton. Since it is not known if platelet PMCA is associated with the cytoskeleton in resting platelets, it was necessary to look for PMCA in the cytoskeleton of resting platelets to determine a baseline for PMCA distribution between the membrane and cytoskeleton. The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that PMCA is not associated with the cytoskeleton or other Triton X-100-insoluble material in the resting platelet. The band labeled “heavy chain” represents nonspecific binding of the primary or secondary antibodies to the heavy chain of IgG used to immunoprecipitate PMCA. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) permitted the detection of PMCA tyrosine phosphorylation as a function of the platelet activation state. Activation of platelets with thrombin or spontaneous aggregation (labeled ADP because of the involvement of secreted ADP in spontaneous aggregation) resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA as shown in Fig. 3. Considerably less tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in platelets treated with prostaglandin E1 to block spontaneous aggregation. Furthermore, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein totally eliminated all tyrosine phosphorylation and prevented spontaneous aggregation. Stripping and reprobing the immunoblot membrane with monoclonal 5F10 anti-PMCA showed that differences in tyrosine phosphorylation were not simply due to the difference in amounts of PMCA applied to the SDS gel. The results in Fig. 3 indicate that PMCA is directly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues during platelet activation. The kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA after addition of thrombin are shown in Fig.4. Increased phosphorylation induced by thrombin was seen at 5 min, and by 10 min the level of phosphorylation returned nearly to the baseline level observed in the absence of thrombin. Phosphorylation of PMCA by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C stimulates PMCA activity (3Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on platelet PMCA was assessed by the addition of pp60 src to purified platelet plasma membranes. This is a reasonable model for platelet-tyrosine phosphorylation since pp60 src is the most abundant non-receptor tyrosine kinase in the platelet and is associated with the plasma membrane (21Golden A. Nemeth S.P. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig.5 A demonstrate that platelet plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity was rapidly inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation. Within 15 min, the platelet PMCA activity was reduced by 75% of the initial activity (□). Furthermore, membranes isolated from thrombin-treated platelets also exhibited inhibition of PMCA activity. Membranes were isolated from thrombin- (5 min) or EGTA-treated platelets by sonication and differential centrifugation and assayed for Ca2+-ATPase activity in the presence of 200 nm thapsigargin to inhibit internal membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity (22Dean W.L. Pope J.E. Brier M.E. Aronoff G.R. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Membranes obtained from EGTA-treated platelets exhibited PMCA activity of 4.1 ± 0.9 nmol/min/mg protein, while thrombin treatment yielded membranes with an activity of 2.5 ± 0.5, an inhibition of 40% withp < 0.021 (two-tail Student's t test). The results shown in Fig. 5 A also demonstrate that PMCA in erythrocyte ghosts is rapidly inhibited by pp60 src, reaching 60% inhibition by 1 h (▴). Purified PMCA is also inhibited to a similar extent, but the process is much slower, possibly because of the lack of membranes or the presence of the detergent Triton X-100 (•). The inhibition of activity seen, at least in the case of the purified PMCA, was not due to loss of ability to interact with calmodulin. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the phosphotyrosine-containing form of PMCA bound as well, if not better, to CaM-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+ as compared with the dephospho- form. Fig. 6 shows that there is excellent correlation between tyrosine phosphorylation of purified erythrocyte PMCA and the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity seen in Fig. 5. pp60 src is autophosphorylated, and this precedes tyrosine phosphorylation of PMCA as expected (23Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2075340477,"The extent to which inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP 3 )–induced calcium signals are localized is a critical parameter for understanding the mechanism of effector activation. The spatial characteristics of InsP 3 -mediated calcium signals were determined by targeting a dextran-based calcium indicator to intracellular membranes through the in situ addition of a geranylgeranyl lipid group. Elementary calcium-release events observed with this indicator typically lasted less than 33 milliseconds, had diameters less than 2 micrometers, and were uncoupled from each other by the calcium buffer EGTA. Cellwide calcium transients are likely to result from synchronized triggering of such local release events, suggesting that calcium-dependent effector proteins could be selectively activated by localization near sites of local calcium release."

Expression of dominant negative p53 inhibited apoptosis of PC12 and Rat-1 cells in response to either serum deprivation or PI 3-kinase inhibition, suggesting the involvement of p53 in this pathway of apoptotic cell death. 2R. Yao, P. Erhardt, and G. M. Cooper, unpublished observations. We therefore investigated the induction of p53 and p53 target genes following either growth factor deprivation or PI 3-kinase inhibition (Fig.1). Populations enriched in apoptotic cells were obtained by collecting cells that had detached from the culture dish following apoptotic stimuli, and lysates of apoptotic and control cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The protein levels of p53 and most p53 targets, including Bax, p21, and GADD45, increased in apoptotic Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the MDM2 protein decreased in these apoptotic cells to barely detectable levels (Fig. 1 B). Similar disappearance of MDM2 was observed in apoptotic Rat-1 cells upon treatment with PI 3-kinase inhibitors (data not shown) and in apoptotic PC12 cells after either growth factor deprivation or treatment with PI 3-kinase inhibitors (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, as in Rat-1 cells, apoptotic PC12 cells contained increased levels of p53, Bax, p21, and GADD45 proteins (not shown). It thus appeared that p53 and proteins encoded by most p53 target genes were induced in apoptotic Rat-1 and PC12 cells, whereas the levels of MDM2 were strikingly reduced. To account for the loss of MDM2 in apoptotic cells, we considered the possibility that MDM2 was cleaved by apoptotic proteases. Proteases of the CPP32 subfamily were activated in both apoptotic Rat-1 and PC12 cells, as indicated by cleavage of the CPP32 substrate PARP (Fig.2 A). CPP32-like proteases recognize the consensus sequence DXXD, with cleavage after the second D (10Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Consistent with the possibility that MDM2 is a substrate for these proteases, six potential DXXD cleavage sites are present in mouse MDM2, and four of these sites are conserved in human and hamster (Fig. 2 B). Cleavage at these multiple sites would degrade MDM2 into small fragments, consistent with the lack of detectable MDM2 in immunoblots with antibody against amino acids 154–167 (Fig. 1 B).Figure 3In vitro cleavage of MDM2 by apoptotic cytosol.

Hase A. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5201-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in which [35S]methionine-labeled MDM2 prepared by in vitro translation was added to cytosols of apoptotic cells. Cytosols were prepared from U937 cells, which provide an efficient source of active apoptotic proteases (19Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As previously reported (24Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar,25Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1127-1132Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2800) Google Scholar), in vitro translated MDM2 migrated at 90 kDa, even though the size predicted from the amino acid sequence is ∼55 kDa. Incubation of MDM2 with cytosol from etoposide-treated apoptotic U937 cells resulted in a loss of intact MDM2 protein, whereas control cytosol from untreated cells had no effect (Fig.3 A, first three lanes). Moreover, with apoptotic cytosol we observed a concomitant appearance of two prominent MDM2 fragments. The sum of the apparent molecular masses of the two fragments (60 and 30 kDa) was approximately equal to the apparent molecular mass of intact MDM2 (90 kDa), indicating that a single site in MDM2 was most sensitive to cleavage by apoptotic proteases. To identify the apoptotic proteases responsible for cleavage of MDM2, we added ICE protease inhibitors. DEVD-CHO, which potently inhibits both the CPP32-like and the ICE-like subfamilies (26Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar), 3K. J. Tomaselli, unpublished observations. abolished the MDM2 cleavage activity of apoptotic cytosol (Fig. 3 A, fifth lane). In contrast, YVAD-CHO, which is a selective inhibitor of the ICE-like subfamily (26Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar), did not affect MDM2 cleavage (Fig. 3 A,fourth lane). Thus, MDM2 cleavage in apoptotic cytosol is catalyzed by CPP32-like as opposed to ICE-like proteases. To further investigate the role of CPP32 in MDM2 cleavage, we immunodepleted apoptotic cytosol with anti-CPP32 antibody. This removed the majority (at least 90%) of CPP32 from the cytosol as assessed by immunoblotting and decreased MDM2 cleavage activity by approximately 50% (Fig. 3 B). It thus appears that CPP32 is a major source of MDM2 cleavage in apoptotic cytosol. However, cleavage of MDM2 may also be catalyzed by other members of the CPP32 subfamily. To directly analyze the ability of CPP32 to cleave MDM2, we tested the activity of CPP32 purified from an E. coli expression system, in which CPP32 is activated as a result of autocatalytic cleavage (21Armstrong R.C. Aja T. Xiang J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Hoang H. Bai X. Korsmeyer S.J. Karanewsky D.S. Fritz L.C. Tomaselli K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16850-16855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Incubation with purified CPP32 resulted in the initial cleavage of MDM2 to two fragments of the same size as those produced by apoptotic cytosol (Fig.4 A). Incubation with increased amounts of CPP32 (or incubation for longer times; data not shown) resulted in the disappearance of the larger fragment, whereas the amount of the smaller fragment remained fairly constant. These results suggest that CPP32 cleaves MDM2 preferentially at a single site, giving rise to two fragments. The sizes of these fragments suggest that this initial cleavage site corresponds to the consensus site located nearest to either the amino or carboxyl terminus of MDM2 (DLKD or DVPD), rather than to one of the potential cleavage sites in the middle of the MDM2 sequence (Fig. 2). The larger fragment then appears to be degraded as a result of cleavage at the multiple additional DXXD sites present in MDM2. This degradation of the larger fragment in vitro is consistent with the absence of any detectable fragment of MDM2 in apoptotic cell lysates (Fig. 1 B). We then tested MDM2 cleavage by other members of the ICE protease family. ICE did not cleave MDM2 in vitro (Fig.4 B, ICE lane). In contrast, two other members of the CPP32 subfamily, Mch2 (caspase-6) and Mch3 (caspase-7) (7Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar, 9Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), were able to cleave MDM2, producing fragments the same size as those produced by apoptotic cytosol or purified CPP32 (Fig. 4 B,Mch3 and Mch2 lanes). In addition, Mch2 yielded a third major cleavage product with apparent molecular mass <30 kDa. However, the cleavage of MDM2 by either Mch2 or Mch3 was significantly less efficient than cleavage by CPP32. These results suggest that there is a limited specificity of MDM2 cleavage for CPP32, and other CPP32 subfamily members (Mch2 and Mch3) also contribute to the cleavage activity. This cleavage of MDM2 by other CPP32-like proteases probably accounts for the remaining activity of apoptotic cytosol following immunodepletion of CPP32 (Fig.3 B). Among the potential cleavage sites in MDM2, the conserved sequence between amino acids 356–359 (DVPD) appeared to be the most likely primary recognition site for CPP32, with cleavage after aspartate 359. This site is almost identical to those in the 70-kDa component of the U1 ribonucleoprotein (DGPD) (10Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and in the sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (DEPD) (12Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Moreover, cleavage at this site would yield two fragments similar in size to those identified in vitro. We therefore introduced a mutation into MDM2, replacing aspartate 359 with glutamic acid (D359E). The mutated MDM2 was resistant to cleavage either by apoptotic cytosol or by purified CPP32 (Fig. 5 A), identifying aspartate 359 as the primary site of CPP32 cleavage. To determine whether aspartate 359 was also a primary site of MDM2 cleavage in vivo, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with amino-terminal HA-tagged MDM2 expression plasmids. Transfected cells were deprived of growth factors, and the tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. With HA-tagged wild type MDM2, a 60-kDa HA-tagged fragment was observed (Fig.5 B, HA-mdm2 lanes). The formation of this fragment was increased following growth factor deprivation, although some cleavage was seen in control cells, probably reflecting apoptosis resulting from toxicity of the lipofectamine transfection procedure. In contrast, no cleavage was detected in cells transfected with HA-tagged D359E mutant MDM2 (Fig. 5 B, HA-D359E-mdm2 lanes), indicating that this mutation protects MDM2 from cleavage in vivo. These results identify the oncoprotein MDM2 as a novel substrate for the CPP32-subfamily of apoptotic proteases. As an inhibitor of p53, MDM2 plays a direct role in the regulation of apoptosis. The biological significance of MDM2 as a negative regulator of p53 is illustrated by the amplification and overexpression of MDM2 in a variety of tumors, particularly sarcomas, containing normal p53 genes (24Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MDM2 in transfected cells also inhibits both p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (27Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It thus appears that induction of MDM2 by p53 forms a negative feedback loop that is critical to regulation of the growth suppressive and apoptotic activities of p53. Our results indicate that cleavage of MDM2 by CPP32-like proteases breaks this feedback loop in apoptotic cells, resulting in deregulation of p53 and potentially contributing directly to the process of apoptotic cell death.

Analysis of the circular dichroism spectra demonstrated that the Ca2+-dependent binding of AIIt to heparin caused a large decrease in the α-helical content of AIIt from ∼44 to 31%, a small decrease in the β-sheet content from ∼27 to 24%, and an increase in the unordered structure from 20 to 29%. The binding of heparin also decreased the Ca2+ concentration required for a half-maximal conformational change in AIIt from 360 to 84 μm. AIIt bound to heparin with an apparentK d of 32 ± 6 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3) and a stoichiometry of 11 ± 0.9 mol of AIIt/mol of heparin (mean ± S.D., n = 3). The binding of heparin to AIIt was specific as other sulfated polysaccharides did not elicit a conformational change in AIIt. A region of the p36 subunit of AIIt (Phe306–Ser313) was found to contain a Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence for glycosaminoglycan recognition. A peptide to this region underwent a conformational change upon heparin binding. Other annexins contained the Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence, but did not undergo a substantial conformational change upon heparin binding.

A peptide to this region underwent a conformational change upon heparin binding. Other annexins contained the Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence, but did not undergo a substantial conformational change upon heparin binding. The annexins are a family of ∼13 proteins that bind to acidic phospholipids and biological membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (see Refs. 1Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. News Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 171-176Google Scholar, 2Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 3Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar for reviews). These proteins are expressed in a wide range of organisms such as slime molds, higher plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Studies of the amino acid sequence of the annexins have established the homology of these proteins. All annexins contain four repeats (eight repeats in the case of annexin VI) of ∼70 amino acids that are highly homologous. In contrast, the N terminus of each of the annexins is unique and displays the greatest variation in sequence and length. The crystal structure of several of the annexins has been reported (4Favier-Perron B. Lewit-Bentley A. Russo-Marie F.

The convex side faces the biological membrane and contains the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites The concave side faces the cytosol and contains the N and C termini.Annexin II (p36) contains three distinct functional regions, the N-terminal region, the C-terminal region, and the core region. The core region of p36 contains the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites, whereas the C-terminal region contains the 14-3-3 homology domain (7Roth D. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the plasminogen-binding domain (8Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of annexin II (p36) contains two important regulatory domains, the L and P domains. The L domain consists of the first 14 residues of the N terminus and contains a high affinity binding site for the p11 protein (reviewed in Ref. 9Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The P domain of p36 contains the phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (Ser25) and pp60 src (Tyr23). The N-terminal L and P domains play regulatory roles; activation of the phosphorylation sites of annexin II tetramer results in an increase in the A 0.5(Ca2+) for chromaffin granule aggregation and F-actin binding, whereas binding of the p11 subunit decreases theA 0.5(Ca2+) for these activities. The heterotetrameric complex (p362·p112) formed by the binding of p11 to p36, referred to as annexin II tetramer (AIIt), 1The abbreviations used are: AIIt, annexin II tetramer; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: AIIt, annexin II tetramer; DTT, dithiothreitol. is the predominant form in most cells (reviewed in Ref. 9Waisman D.M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).In a previous study (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we reported that AIIt bound to a heparin affinity column and that the phosphorylation of AIIt on tyrosine residues blocked the heparin-binding activity of the protein. In this report, we have characterized the interaction of AIIt with heparin. Our results identify AIIt as a specific, high affinity heparin-binding protein. Furthermore, we show that the Ca2+-dependent binding of heparin to AIIt causes a dramatic conformational change in the protein. Last, we show that the p36 subunit of AIIt contains a Cardin-Weintraub glycosaminoglycan recognition site (16Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that a peptide to this region of AIIt binds heparin.DISCUSSIONPrevious work from our laboratory established that AIIt is a Ca2+-dependent heparin-binding protein (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The interaction of AIIt with heparin was also shown to be inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation of AIIt (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since the role that heparin binding plays in the structure or function of AIIt is unknown, the current study was aimed at the characterization of the interaction of heparin with AIIt. Analysis of the CD spectra of AIIt showed that the binding of heparin to AIIt resulted in a profound change in the conformation of AIIt (Fig. 1 and Table I). We also found that in the absence of Ca2+, a small change in the conformation of AIIt occurred upon heparin binding.Animal carbohydrate-binding proteins can be broadly classified into seven major groups. These include the C-type or Ca2+-dependent lectins, the S-type or Gal-binding galectins, P-type mannose 6-phosphate receptors, the I-type lectins, the pentraxins, the hyaluronan-binding proteins, and the heparin-binding proteins (26Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The C-type lectins bind several carbohydrates including mannose and galactose and require Ca2+ to form a coordination bond with the sugar ligand. The galectins bind only β-galactoside, whereas the P-type proteins bind only mannose 6-phosphate. The I-type lectins bind only sialic acid, whereas the pentraxins bind several carbohydrates such as heparin and sialic acid as well as phosphorylcholine. The hyaluronan-binding proteins bind only hyaluronan. The heparin-binding proteins generally demonstrate Ca2+-independent binding of both heparin and heparan sulfate. Since AIIt binds heparin (Table II) but not phosphorylcholine (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), AIIt is most likely a member of the heparin-binding family of proteins. However, AIIt appears to be unique among heparin-binding protein members in that the binding of AIIt to heparin is stimulated by Ca2+. Furthermore, AIIt appears to be a unique member of the heparin-binding proteins because AIIt can discriminate between heparin and heparan sulfate ligands.Several consensus sequences have been identified among members of the heparin-binding family of proteins. For example, the heparin-binding sequence of the C-terminal region of fibronectin has been identified asWQPPRARI (27Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, a region of thrombospondin containing the sequence WSPW has been identified as the heparin-binding region of the protein (28Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of several heparin-binding proteins has suggested the potential existence of two consensus sequences referred to as Cardin-Weintraub heparin-binding consensus sequences (16Cardin A.D.

Other studies have shown that the orientation of the Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence within the protein is critical and may determine if the consensus sequence participates in heparin binding (33Ma Y.

As shown in Table III, the p36 subunit of AIIt contains a Cardin-Weintraub heparin-binding consensus sequence. Furthermore, a peptide to this region of the p36 subunit of AIIt (300LKIRSEFKKKYGKSLYY316) undergoes a conformational change upon heparin binding (Fig. 8). These results therefore suggest that residues 300–316 of the p36 subunit of AIIt are involved in heparin binding.Although the monomeric annexins I–VI bind to a heparin affinity column in the presence of Ca2+, a heparin-dependent conformational change was not observed for these proteins (Table IV). The p36 subunit of AIIt can exist as a monomer or as a heterotetramer. Heterotetrameric AIIt is composed of two p36 subunits and two p11 subunits. Considering that the p36 subunit (annexin II) binds to a heparin affinity column and contains the Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence, it was surprising that the p36 subunit did not undergo a conformational change upon heparin binding. This suggests that the heparin-binding site of the p36 subunit and other monomeric annexins is preformed and does not require the recruitment of residues from other regions of the protein. This is consistent with the observation that carbohydrate-binding proteins undergo few if any changes in conformation upon carbohydrate binding (26Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The p11 subunit of AIIt does not bind heparin and does not contain any heparin-binding consensus sequences. It is therefore unlikely that the heparin-dependent conformational change in AIIt was due to the coordinated binding of heparin by both the p36 and p11 subunits of AIIt. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the binding of the p36 subunit to the p11 subunit induces a conformational change in the p11 subunit that results in exposure of a novel heparin-binding domain. The simplest explanation for the large conformational change in AIIt upon heparin binding is that the orientation of the p36 subunits in AIIt is not optimal for heparin binding. Therefore, the binding of heparin to AIIt results in the realignment of the p36 subunits.Of particular interest was our observation that the Ca2+-dependent conformational change in AIIt was induced by heparin, but not by other negatively charged glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dextran sulfate. Heparan sulfates are structurally related glycosaminoglycans that are found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, where they form the chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and bear only short stretches of dense sulfation. In contrast, heparin is the glycosaminoglycan that is secreted by mast cells and other hematopoietic cells and therefore may serve as a signaling molecule (38Lindblom A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G.

To date, a heparin-binding protein capable of distinguishing between heparin and heparan sulfate has not been described. Recently, annexin IV was shown to bind heparin, but the binding of heparin to this protein was inhibited by a variety of carbohydrates including glucose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate (40Kojima K. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Osawa T. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7679-7685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have found that heparan sulfate or other glycosaminoglycans do not induce a conformational change in AIIt (Table II). Furthermore, high concentrations of heparan sulfate (50 μm) do not inhibit the conformational change in AIIt elicited by 0.5 μmheparin (Table II), therefore suggesting that heparan sulfate does not bind to AIIt. However, considering the heterogeneity of the cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (38Lindblom A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Fransson L.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is possible that AIIt may interact with other heparan sulfate proteoglycans.We also observed that AIIt formed a large complex with heparin and that this complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 400,000 ×g. Analysis of the binding isotherm suggested that AIIt bound heparin with an apparent K d of 32 ± 6 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3) and a stoichiometry of 11 ± 0.9 mol of AIIt/mol of heparin (mean ± S.D., n = 3). This K d for the binding of heparin to AIIt is slightly lower than theK d reported for the binding of heparin to heparinase (60 nm), acidic fibroblast growth factor (50–140 nm), or fibronectin (34 nm), but higher than that reported for the binding of heparin to basic fibroblast growth factor (2.2 nm) or antithrombin III (11 nm) (32Sasisekharan R.

Heparin has been shown to interact with enzymes of the clotting and fibrinolysis systems (24Agnelli, G.

It is therefore possible that heparin might be involved in the regulation of the interaction of AIIt with these ligands. The annexins are a family of ∼13 proteins that bind to acidic phospholipids and biological membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (see Refs. 1Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. News Physiol.

These proteins are expressed in a wide range of organisms such as slime molds, higher plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Studies of the amino acid sequence of the annexins have established the homology of these proteins. All annexins contain four repeats (eight repeats in the case of annexin VI) of ∼70 amino acids that are highly homologous. In contrast, the N terminus of each of the annexins is unique and displays the greatest variation in sequence and length. The crystal structure of several of the annexins has been reported (4Favier-Perron B. Lewit-Bentley A. Russo-Marie F.

The convex side faces the biological membrane and contains the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites The concave side faces the cytosol and contains the N and C termini. Annexin II (p36) contains three distinct functional regions, the N-terminal region, the C-terminal region, and the core region. The core region of p36 contains the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites, whereas the C-terminal region contains the 14-3-3 homology domain (7Roth D. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the plasminogen-binding domain (8Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of annexin II (p36) contains two important regulatory domains, the L and P domains. The L domain consists of the first 14 residues of the N terminus and contains a high affinity binding site for the p11 protein (reviewed in Ref. 9Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The P domain of p36 contains the phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (Ser25) and pp60 src (Tyr23). The N-terminal L and P domains play regulatory roles; activation of the phosphorylation sites of annexin II tetramer results in an increase in the A 0.5(Ca2+) for chromaffin granule aggregation and F-actin binding, whereas binding of the p11 subunit decreases theA 0.5(Ca2+) for these activities. The heterotetrameric complex (p362·p112) formed by the binding of p11 to p36, referred to as annexin II tetramer (AIIt), 1The abbreviations used are: AIIt, annexin II tetramer; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: AIIt, annexin II tetramer; DTT, dithiothreitol. is the predominant form in most cells (reviewed in Ref. 9Waisman D.M.

AIIt has been shown to be present at both the cytosolic and extracellular surfaces of the plasma membrane of many cells (9Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Extracellular AIIt has been proposed to function as a cell adhesion factor (10Tressler R.J. Updyke T.V. Yeatman T. Nicolson G.L.

In a previous study (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we reported that AIIt bound to a heparin affinity column and that the phosphorylation of AIIt on tyrosine residues blocked the heparin-binding activity of the protein. In this report, we have characterized the interaction of AIIt with heparin. Our results identify AIIt as a specific, high affinity heparin-binding protein. Furthermore, we show that the Ca2+-dependent binding of heparin to AIIt causes a dramatic conformational change in the protein. Last, we show that the p36 subunit of AIIt contains a Cardin-Weintraub glycosaminoglycan recognition site (16Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that a peptide to this region of AIIt binds heparin. DISCUSSIONPrevious work from our laboratory established that AIIt is a Ca2+-dependent heparin-binding protein (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The interaction of AIIt with heparin was also shown to be inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation of AIIt (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since the role that heparin binding plays in the structure or function of AIIt is unknown, the current study was aimed at the characterization of the interaction of heparin with AIIt. Analysis of the CD spectra of AIIt showed that the binding of heparin to AIIt resulted in a profound change in the conformation of AIIt (Fig. 1 and Table I). We also found that in the absence of Ca2+, a small change in the conformation of AIIt occurred upon heparin binding.Animal carbohydrate-binding proteins can be broadly classified into seven major groups. These include the C-type or Ca2+-dependent lectins, the S-type or Gal-binding galectins, P-type mannose 6-phosphate receptors, the I-type lectins, the pentraxins, the hyaluronan-binding proteins, and the heparin-binding proteins (26Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The C-type lectins bind several carbohydrates including mannose and galactose and require Ca2+ to form a coordination bond with the sugar ligand. The galectins bind only β-galactoside, whereas the P-type proteins bind only mannose 6-phosphate. The I-type lectins bind only sialic acid, whereas the pentraxins bind several carbohydrates such as heparin and sialic acid as well as phosphorylcholine. The hyaluronan-binding proteins bind only hyaluronan. The heparin-binding proteins generally demonstrate Ca2+-independent binding of both heparin and heparan sulfate. Since AIIt binds heparin (Table II) but not phosphorylcholine (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), AIIt is most likely a member of the heparin-binding family of proteins. However, AIIt appears to be unique among heparin-binding protein members in that the binding of AIIt to heparin is stimulated by Ca2+. Furthermore, AIIt appears to be a unique member of the heparin-binding proteins because AIIt can discriminate between heparin and heparan sulfate ligands.Several consensus sequences have been identified among members of the heparin-binding family of proteins. For example, the heparin-binding sequence of the C-terminal region of fibronectin has been identified asWQPPRARI (27Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, a region of thrombospondin containing the sequence WSPW has been identified as the heparin-binding region of the protein (28Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A.

Analysis of several heparin-binding proteins has suggested the potential existence of two consensus sequences referred to as Cardin-Weintraub heparin-binding consensus sequences (16Cardin A.D.

Goldfarb M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). AIIt is the major cellular receptor for tenascin-C and plasminogen (8Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol.

It is therefore possible that heparin might be involved in the regulation of the interaction of AIIt with these ligands. Previous work from our laboratory established that AIIt is a Ca2+-dependent heparin-binding protein (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The interaction of AIIt with heparin was also shown to be inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation of AIIt (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since the role that heparin binding plays in the structure or function of AIIt is unknown, the current study was aimed at the characterization of the interaction of heparin with AIIt. Analysis of the CD spectra of AIIt showed that the binding of heparin to AIIt resulted in a profound change in the conformation of AIIt (Fig. 1 and Table I). We also found that in the absence of Ca2+, a small change in the conformation of AIIt occurred upon heparin binding. Animal carbohydrate-binding proteins can be broadly classified into seven major groups. These include the C-type or Ca2+-dependent lectins, the S-type or Gal-binding galectins, P-type mannose 6-phosphate receptors, the I-type lectins, the pentraxins, the hyaluronan-binding proteins, and the heparin-binding proteins (26Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The C-type lectins bind several carbohydrates including mannose and galactose and require Ca2+ to form a coordination bond with the sugar ligand. The galectins bind only β-galactoside, whereas the P-type proteins bind only mannose 6-phosphate. The I-type lectins bind only sialic acid, whereas the pentraxins bind several carbohydrates such as heparin and sialic acid as well as phosphorylcholine. The hyaluronan-binding proteins bind only hyaluronan. The heparin-binding proteins generally demonstrate Ca2+-independent binding of both heparin and heparan sulfate. Since AIIt binds heparin (Table II) but not phosphorylcholine (15Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), AIIt is most likely a member of the heparin-binding family of proteins. However, AIIt appears to be unique among heparin-binding protein members in that the binding of AIIt to heparin is stimulated by Ca2+. Furthermore, AIIt appears to be a unique member of the heparin-binding proteins because AIIt can discriminate between heparin and heparan sulfate ligands. Several consensus sequences have been identified among members of the heparin-binding family of proteins. For example, the heparin-binding sequence of the C-terminal region of fibronectin has been identified asWQPPRARI (27Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, a region of thrombospondin containing the sequence WSPW has been identified as the heparin-binding region of the protein (28Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Guo N. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of several heparin-binding proteins has suggested the potential existence of two consensus sequences referred to as Cardin-Weintraub heparin-binding consensus sequences (16Cardin A.D.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 203: 556-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis and binding studies with synthetic or isolated peptides from several of these proteins have confirmed that this consensus region is often involved in binding heparin (30Cardin A.D.

Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the orientation of the Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence within the protein is critical and may determine if the consensus sequence participates in heparin binding (33Ma Y. Henderson H.E. Liu M.S. Zhang H. Forsythe I.J. Clarke-Lewis I. Hayden M.R. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2049-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wong P. Hampton B.

As shown in Table III, the p36 subunit of AIIt contains a Cardin-Weintraub heparin-binding consensus sequence. Furthermore, a peptide to this region of the p36 subunit of AIIt (300LKIRSEFKKKYGKSLYY316) undergoes a conformational change upon heparin binding (Fig. 8). These results therefore suggest that residues 300–316 of the p36 subunit of AIIt are involved in heparin binding. Although the monomeric annexins I–VI bind to a heparin affinity column in the presence of Ca2+, a heparin-dependent conformational change was not observed for these proteins (Table IV). The p36 subunit of AIIt can exist as a monomer or as a heterotetramer. Heterotetrameric AIIt is composed of two p36 subunits and two p11 subunits. Considering that the p36 subunit (annexin II) binds to a heparin affinity column and contains the Cardin-Weintraub consensus sequence, it was surprising that the p36 subunit did not undergo a conformational change upon heparin binding. This suggests that the heparin-binding site of the p36 subunit and other monomeric annexins is preformed and does not require the recruitment of residues from other regions of the protein. This is consistent with the observation that carbohydrate-binding proteins undergo few if any changes in conformation upon carbohydrate binding (26Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The p11 subunit of AIIt does not bind heparin and does not contain any heparin-binding consensus sequences. It is therefore unlikely that the heparin-dependent conformational change in AIIt was due to the coordinated binding of heparin by both the p36 and p11 subunits of AIIt. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the binding of the p36 subunit to the p11 subunit induces a conformational change in the p11 subunit that results in exposure of a novel heparin-binding domain. The simplest explanation for the large conformational change in AIIt upon heparin binding is that the orientation of the p36 subunits in AIIt is not optimal for heparin binding. Therefore, the binding of heparin to AIIt results in the realignment of the p36 subunits. Of particular interest was our observation that the Ca2+-dependent conformational change in AIIt was induced by heparin, but not by other negatively charged glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dextran sulfate. Heparan sulfates are structurally related glycosaminoglycans that are found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, where they form the chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and bear only short stretches of dense sulfation. In contrast, heparin is the glycosaminoglycan that is secreted by mast cells and other hematopoietic cells and therefore may serve as a signaling molecule (38Lindblom A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Fransson L.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Matsumoto R. Sali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To date, a heparin-binding protein capable of distinguishing between heparin and heparan sulfate has not been described. Recently, annexin IV was shown to bind heparin, but the binding of heparin to this protein was inhibited by a variety of carbohydrates including glucose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate (40Kojima K. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Osawa T. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7679-7685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have found that heparan sulfate or other glycosaminoglycans do not induce a conformational change in AIIt (Table II). Furthermore, high concentrations of heparan sulfate (50 μm) do not inhibit the conformational change in AIIt elicited by 0.5 μmheparin (Table II), therefore suggesting that heparan sulfate does not bind to AIIt. However, considering the heterogeneity of the cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (38Lindblom A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Fransson L.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is possible that AIIt may interact with other heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We also observed that AIIt formed a large complex with heparin and that this complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 400,000 ×g. Analysis of the binding isotherm suggested that AIIt bound heparin with an apparent K d of 32 ± 6 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3) and a stoichiometry of 11 ± 0.9 mol of AIIt/mol of heparin (mean ± S.D., n = 3). This K d for the binding of heparin to AIIt is slightly lower than theK d reported for the binding of heparin to heparinase (60 nm), acidic fibroblast growth factor (50–140 nm), or fibronectin (34 nm), but higher than that reported for the binding of heparin to basic fibroblast growth factor (2.2 nm) or antithrombin III (11 nm) (32Sasisekharan R.

The binding of ∼11 molecules of AIIt to a single 17-kDa heparin strand that contains ∼50 monosaccharide units (Fig. 5) suggests that AIIt requires ∼4–5 monosaccharide units for binding. The physiological significance of the binding of heparin to AIIt is unclear. Heparin has been shown to interact with enzymes of the clotting and fibrinolysis systems (24Agnelli, G.

Ubiquitination is implicated in the proteasomal degradation of a rapidly growing list of regulatory proteins including cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, and tumor suppressors. Additionally, there are recent data suggesting a role for this post-translational modification in receptor-mediated endocytosis (8Weissman A.M. Immunol.

This occurs as the result of a multienzyme process involving sequential thiol-ester bonds with classes of enzymes termed E1–E3. This cascade culminates in the formation of isopeptide bonds between the C terminus of Ub and the ε-amino groups of lysines on either a substrate or the growing end of a protein-bound multiubiquitin chain. This process is initiated by the ATP-dependent formation of high energy thiol-ester bonds between E1 (Ub-activating enzyme) and the C terminus of Ub. Ub is then transferred to E2s (UBCs or Ub-conjugating enzymes). Models based on the N-end rule E3s of yeast and mammals (1Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) had E3s functioning primarily as docking proteins that recognize substrates and Ub-bound E2s, facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to substrate. However, more recent findings obtained with E6-AP (E6-associated protein) have demonstrated that, at least in some cases, Ub moieties bound to E3s through thiol-ester linkages represent the final intermediates in the ubiquitination cascade (11Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 12Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the N-end rule E3s similarly form thiol intermediates with Ub. Only one E1 enzyme has been characterized in mammals. In contrast, over 10 distinct E2s have been characterized in humans, as well as in yeast, and in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (reviewed in Refs. 4Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev.

Since substrate specificity for ubiquitination appears to lie largely at the level of E3-substrate interactions, it is generally believed that there are a large number of E3s.

This E3 catalyzes p53 ubiquitination but does so only in the presence of viral E6 proteins from strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) that are high risk for the development of uterine cervical carcinomas (HPV-16 and HPV-18). E6-dependent ubiquitination is presumably responsible for the diminished levels of p53 characteristic of HPV-16- and HPV-18-infected cells (24Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Recently rat Nedd-4 was cloned as a binding partner for the γ subunit of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel using the yeast two-hybrid system (27Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This association occurs through interactions of tryptophan-containing WW domains of Nedd-4 with proline-rich PY motifs within sodium channel subunits (27Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 28Sudol M. Chen H.I. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P.

In Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of hypertension characterized by increased activity and cell surface expression of sodium channels, mutations within genes encoding subunits of the sodium channel result in loss of PY motifs (30Snyder P.M.

This raises the intriguing possibility that this ion channel is regulated by Nedd-4-dependent ubiquitination. However, until now Nedd-4 has not been demonstrated to be a catalytically active E3. In the present study, we report the cloning of cDNAs encoding full-length murine Nedd-4 and murine E6-AP (mE6-AP) and determine that they are both catalytically active E3s. In addition, their subcellular localizations and their physical interactions with an E2 enzyme are investigated. Probes for screening cDNA libraries were generated from first strand cDNA from Jurkat cells or mouse brain using a cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) followed by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers 2Oligonucleotide sequences available on request. for 35 cycles with the following parameters: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. Probes corresponded to bases 1991–2572 of human E6-AP (24Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and bases 1489–2097 of the partial mouse Nedd-4 sequence (26Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). For both mE6-AP and Nedd-4, 1 × 106 independent phage plaques of an oligo(dT)-primed λZAP (Stratagene) mouse thymus cDNA library were screened using 32P-labeled random primed probes (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Replica filters were hybridized at 55 °C for 24 h in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA. Filters were subject to a final wash in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by in vivo excision (Stratagene), and sequenced. Alignments were performed using the BESTFIT program through the National Library of Medicine. Bacterial lysates expressing recombinant E2s were prepared as described (32Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30408-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding nUbcH5B (amino acids 1–67 of UbcH5B) was generated by PCR amplification using UbcH5B as template and ligated into pET-15b (Novagen). Plasmid encoding cUbcH5B (amino acids 67–143 of UbcH5B) was generated by PCR using UbcH5B as template, with sense and antisense nucleotides that created a 5′ NcoI site and a 3′ XhoI site. The product was cloned into pBluescript, digested with SalI and PstI, and subcloned into pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs) to generate plasmid encoding MBP-cUbcH5B. Purified plasmids were transfected into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli (Novagen), and induction of recombinant protein with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out per the manufacturer's instructions. E. coli extracts were prepared from frozen cell pellets as described previously (32Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30408-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein content of crude extracts were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining. To generate a plasmid encoding Schistosoma japonicumglutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to amino acids 32–869 of mE6-AP, mE6-AP cDNA in pBluescript was digested withHincII and SmaI and ligated into theSmaI site of pGEX-KG (33Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) (pGEX-mE6-AP). To generate pGEX-mE6-AP432 and pGEX-mE6-AP274, pGEX-mE6-AP was digested withXbaI or XhoI respectively and autoligated. pGEX-mE6-AP679 was generated by digestion of pGEX-mE6-AP withBglI and HindIII, filling in with Klenow, and autoligation. For GST-Nedd-4, mouse Nedd-4 cDNA in pBluescript was digested with AvrII and SpeI and ligated into theXbaI site of pGEX-KG (pGEX-Nedd-4). Plasmid encoding GST-Nedd-4-N (amino acids 52–777) was constructed by digestion of pGEX-Nedd-4 with HindIII and self-ligation. GST-Nedd-4-C was generated from pBS-Nedd-4–15 by digestion with HindIII and ligating the fragment (bases 1876–3480) into the HindIII site of pGEX-KG. Plasmid encoding GST-Nedd-4CT (amino acids 423–670) was generated by PCR using Nedd-4 cDNA as a template and a sense primer corresponding to bases 1876–1895 with an EcoRI site and an antisense primer corresponding to bases 2604–2621 with a stop codon and an XhoI site. The product was subcloned into pBluescript II, sequenced, and subcloned into pGEX-KG in theEcoRI and XhoI sites. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain DH5α induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Bacterial cell pellets resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline were lysed by sonication, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and either stored in this buffer or eluted in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mm reduced glutathione. Protein content was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining. Reaction mixtures containing 0.5 μg of purified GST fusion proteins and 1 μl of crude lysate fromE. coli expressing wheat E1 (34Hatfield P.M. Callis J. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15813-15817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1 μl of the appropriate E2s, and 10 μg of bovine Ub (Sigma) were incubated as described (32Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30408-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 30 °C, followed by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol (reducing sample buffer). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted with previously described affinity-purified anti-Ub raised against Ub coupled to chicken serum albumin (35Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) followed by development with125I-protein A (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and visualized by autoradiography as described (35Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In these assays, bacterial proteins from the crude extracts serve as the source of ubiquitination substrates. For p53 ubiquitination reactions, RNA was prepared from plasmids encoding HPV-E6 and human p53 (36Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar) using Ribomax (Promega, Madison, WI), and in vitro translation was carried out in wheat germ extract (Promega) without (E6) or with (p53) [35S]methionine (ICN). Reaction mixtures containing E1 and E2s with either 0.5 μg of crude lysate from SF9 cells transfected with baculovirus expressing a 95-kDa truncated human E6-AP (a gift from J. Huibregtse and P. Howley) or 0.5 μg of purified GST-E3 fusion proteins were incubated as above prior to resolution on 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Myc-tagged mE6-AP, a cDNA fragment encoding an NH2-terminal Myc tag and a four-amino acid linker (37Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in continuity with the NH2 terminus of mE6-AP (up to base 347) was amplified from pBS-E6-AP-11 using oligonucleotides that resulted in the generation of a 5′ KpnI site. The product was digested with KpnI and HincII and ligated into pBS-E6-AP-11 that was similarly digested. The resultant product was digested with KpnI and SmaI and ligated fromKpnI to EcoRV in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA-Myc-E6-AP. For HA-tagged-Nedd-4, the vector pSNeo was first generated. pcDNA3 was digested with BglII and SacI, a 4.4-kilobase pair fragment purified and filled in by T4 polymerase. pSX-SRα (38Rutledge T. Cosson P. Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was digested with SalI, and a 2.2-kilobase pair fragment was purified and filled in by Klenow. These fragments were ligated to generate pSNeo. A cDNA fragment encoding Nedd-4 with an HA-tagged sequence at its N terminus was amplified from pBS-Nedd-4–15 plasmid by PCR using a 5′ primer that generated a NotI site followed by an HA tag contiguous with the amino terminus of Nedd-4 and an antisense oligo that included the AvrII site of Nedd-4. The product was digested with NotI and AvrII, purified, and ligated into pBS-Nedd-4–15 that had been similarly digested. This product was digested with NotI and EcoRI and subcloned into pSneo from NotI to EcoRI to generate pS-HA-Nedd-4. Cells transfected 48 h earlier with 20 μg of DNA were fractionated basically as described by Grenfell (39Grenfell S.J. Trausch-Azar J.S. Handley-Gearhart P.M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Immunofluorescence staining of transfected COS-7 cells was carried out as described (40Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using culture supernatants from cells producing either 9E10 (anti-Myc) (41Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) or 12CA5 (anti-HA) (Boehringer Mannheim). Binding assays were performed by a modification of the method of Huibregtse et al. (25Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of recombinant E2 enzyme was mixed with 1 μg of GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in 400 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Mixtures were rotated at 4 °C for 20 h, washed four times with binding buffer, and, after elution in reducing sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.) and reacted with affinity-purified anti-Caenorhabditis elegans UBC2 polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) (42Zhen M. Heinlein R. Jones D. Jentsch S. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or with anti-MBP polyclonal antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (New England Biolabs). Samples were then treated as described for anti-Ub immunoblotting (35Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Probes based on human E6-AP and C-terminal nucleotide sequences from the partial murine Nedd-4 were used to isolated full-length cDNAs encoding mouse E6-AP and Nedd-4 from a mouse thymocyte library. mE6-AP has a predicted molecular mass of 99.4 kDa and a pI of 4.74 and exhibits 96.2 and 94.2% deduced amino acid similarity and identity, respectively, with human E6-AP (Fig.1 A). Unlike human E6-AP, an ATG in the context of a Kozak sequence (43Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was identified within the murine E6-AP cDNA. In the 18-amino acid region (amino acids 396–413) implicated in the binding of HPV E6 to human E6-AP (25Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell.

The full-length murine Nedd-4 clone exhibits 95.9% identity and 97.7% similarity with the rat Nedd-4 and shows 95.2% similarity and 90.1% identity with an unpublished GenBankTM-registered human Nedd-4. The mouse, as well as the rat, Nedd-4 cDNA has a 67-amino acid gap relative to the deduced amino acid sequence of the human protein; this gap corresponds to one of the four WW domains in human Nedd-4. To determine if this difference is due to alternative splicing in the mouse, PCR amplification of first strand cDNA from multiple mouse tissues was performed across this region; however, no evidence of a longer product was found (not shown). Messenger RNA for both mE6-AP and p53 was found in all murine tissues examined. Mouse E6-AP mRNA was most abundant in brain, thymus, and heart, while Nedd-4 was found at the greatest levels in lung and kidney (not shown). To determine whether mE6-AP and Nedd-4 function as E3s, recombinant GST-E6-AP (amino acids 32–869 of mE6-AP) and GST-Nedd-4 (amino acids 52–777 of Nedd-4) were generated and assessed for their ability to catalyze the ubiquitination of bacterial cellular proteins (Fig. 2, A andB). Since multiple proteins serve as substrates in this assay, ubiquitinated species generally appear as a smear on anti-Ub immunoblots (32Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J.

As shown (Fig. 2 A), Nedd-4 catalyzes ubiquitination in the presence of E1 and E2. Some weak E2-independent, E1-dependent Nedd-4-mediated ubiquitination is also observed.

Attention has focused on the hypothalamus as its potential site of action, but OB could also act on other brain regions. In addition, the paradox of high OB levels in obese humans remains unresolved. Here we show in mice that both the long and short form of the OB receptor are expressed not only in the hypothalamus but also in the amygdala and pituitary. Recombinant murine OB elicited the release of corticotropin-releasing factor from superfused brain slice preparations containing hypothalamus or amygdala. Because corticotropin-releasing factor inhibits appetite and stimulates metabolism, it may be a key mediator of central OB effects. Recombinant OB also induced pituitary release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Because adrenocorticotrophic hormone-induced elevation of plasma glucocorticoid levels can inhibit corticotropin-releasing factor release via negative feedback, the OB effects on pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone release may be pertinent to human obesity, which combines increased plasma glucocorticoid levels with elevated levels of OB. An imbalance between the effects of OB on corticotropin-releasing factor release from the hypothalamus and on adrenocorticotrophic hormone release from the pituitary could contribute to obesity.

The development and maintenance of obesity is associated with profound endocrine disturbances, including increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (19Cunningham J.J.

In genetically obese animals, hyperphagia and excessive weight gain are eliminated by adrenalectomy and are restored by treatment with glucocorticoids (23Yukimura Y. Bray G.A. Wolfsen A.R.

Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 89-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and the inhibitory actions of corticosteroids on hypothalamic CRF synthesis and/or release may contribute to obesity. The amygdala is involved in stress-related reactions (27Koob G.F. Heinrichs S.C. Pich E.M. Menzaghi F. Baldwin H. Miczek K. Britton K.T. CIBA Found. Symp. 1993; 172: 277-289PubMed Google Scholar) and in the regulation of the HPA axis (28Dunn J. Whitener J. Neuroendocrinology. 1986; 42: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Beaulieu S. Pelletier G. Vaudry H. Barden N. Neuroendovrinology. 1989; 49: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The amygdala contains high levels of CRF (30Cummings S. Elde R. Ells J. Lindall A. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CRF-containing fibers have been traced from the amygdala to the lateral hypothalamus and may directly innervate CRF-containing neurons within the PVN (31Gray T.S. Carney M.E. Magnuson D.J. Neuroendocrinology. 1989; 50: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As yet, no reports have appeared on the expression of OB-R in the amygdala. If expressed, OB-R might mediate CRF release by OB within the amygdala. The OB receptor is a member of the extended cytokine receptor family and resembles gp130, the common signal-transducing subunit of a group of cytokine receptors that includes receptors for IL-6. Receptors for IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 have been demonstrated in the pituitary of several species, and direct stimulation of pituitary ACTH release by these cytokines has been reported (32Arzt E. Stalla G.K. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1996; 3: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). OB might also directly act at the level of the pituitary to modulate ACTH release. The aim of the present work was to determine whether OB-R mRNA is expressed in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and pituitary and whether OB can modulate the release of CRF from the hypothalamus or the amygdala and of ACTH from the pituitary to identify potential central mediators of OB effects. C57BL/6J mice 8–12 weeks of age (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all experiments. All mice were housed at no more than four per cage under conditions of constant temperature (18 °C), light from 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m., and access to food and water ad libitum. The mice were killed by decapitation between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. to avoid circadian variation. The hypothalamus, amygdala, and pituitary were dissected as described (33Raber J. Toggas S.M. Lee S. Bloom F.E. Epstein C.J. Mucke L. Virology. 1996; 226: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until RNA was extracted, and RNase protection assay was performed as described previously (34Xia Y. Feng L. Yoshimura T. Wilson C.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F774-F780PubMed Google Scholar). OB-R and L32 mRNA levels were determined by RNase protection assay using antisense riboprobes for the short and long forms of the OB-R and murine L32, respectively. cDNA templates for the short (1250–1474, GenBank™ accession number U42467) and the long (3040–3396, GenBank™ accession number U46135) OB-R probes were subcloned from a mouse hypothalamus cDNA library. To measure hypothalamic CRF and arginine vasopressin (AVP) release and pituitary ACTH release, dissected tissues were placed onto a Brinkmann tissue chopper, and 300-μm slices were prepared. Slices representing one entire hypothalamus, amygdala, or pituitary were placed into individual chambers and superfused using anin vitro superfusion system (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) (33Raber J. Toggas S.M. Lee S. Bloom F.E. Epstein C.J. Mucke L. Virology. 1996; 226: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Basal release of CRF and AVP from hypothalamus stabilizes after 100 min (35Raber J. Mehta P.P. Kreifeldt M. Parsons L.H. Weiss F. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and release of ACTH from the pituitary stabilizes after 180 min (36Beach J.E. Smallridge R.C. Kinzer C.A. Bernton E.W. Holaday J.W. Fein H.G. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These times were chosen as the start of the first 15-min basal period for all subsequent experiments to determine the effect of OB on hypothalamic CRF and AVP and pituitary ACTH release. During the sample collection period, fractions were collected at 15-min intervals, placed on dry ice, and stored at −70 °C until determination of the concentration of CRF and ACTH in the media by radioimmunoassay (33Raber J. Toggas S.M. Lee S. Bloom F.E. Epstein C.J. Mucke L. Virology. 1996; 226: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,35Raber J. Mehta P.P. Kreifeldt M. Parsons L.H. Weiss F. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). OB recombinant protein was produced in and purified from anEscherichia coli expression system. In brief, the coding region (65–619, GenBank™ accession number U18812) was cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using total RNA from C57BL/6J white adipose tissue as a template. The coding region was subcloned in an expression vector (pETM1) (37Feng L. Xia Y. Wilson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to express a His-tagged recombinant mouse OB protein. The recombinant OB was expressed, purified, and refolded following a previously described procedure (38Xia Y. Garcia G. Chen S. Wilson C.B. Feng L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were raised by immunizing a rabbit with the recombinant mouse OB and tested for biological activity to reduce body weight in ob/ob and control mice as described elsewhere. 2S. Chen, Y. Xia, and L. Feng, manuscript in preparation. This manuscript describes the bioactivity of recombinant OB and neutralizing capacity of anti-OB antibodies. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. For comparisons of multiple means, analysis of variance was used, followed by Tukey-Kramer posthoc test when appropriate. A probability value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. To determine if OB may act on other regions besides the hypothalamus, we looked for expression of the short and long forms of OB-R mRNA in the amygdala and pituitary, regions that are involved in the regulation of the hypothalamus (28Dunn J. Whitener J. Neuroendocrinology. 1986; 42: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 39Antoni F.A. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 351-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Both forms of the OB-R were constitutively expressed not only in the hypothalamus, but also in the amygdala and pituitary of mice (Fig. 1). To determine the role of CRF in the central actions of OB, the effect of recombinant mouse OB on the release of CRF from the hypothalamus and amygdala was investigated in superfused brain slice preparations. Superfusion with purified recombinant OB significantly increased CRF release from hypothalamic slices (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to CRF release, hypothalamic AVP release was not affected by superfusion with OB at 100 pm, 1 nm, or 10 nm (data not shown). To ensure that the effect of OB on hypothalamic CRF release was due specifically to OB and not to an impurity in the recombinant OB preparation, tissues were superfused with OB in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing OB antibodies blocked the OB-induced hypothalamic CRF release (Fig.2 B), indicating that the effect on CRF release was indeed caused by OB. These findings are consistent with the postulate that CRF may function as a mediator of OB effects. The above observations support a key role for CRF in OB biology and confirm the hypothalamus as an important site of OB actions. In addition, our study revealed that OB has specific effects on other brain regions. OB stimulated CRF release also from the amygdala (Fig.3). In combination with the expression of OB-R mRNA in the amygdala (Fig. 1), this finding suggests that the amygdala may play a role in centrally mediated OB effects. The amygdala, which contains high levels of CRF, is involved in the expression of fear and anxiety (40Liang K.C. Melia K.R. Campeau S. Falls W.A. Miserendo M.J. Davis M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could mediate behavioral effects of OB. The development and maintenance of obesity is associated with an increased activity of the HPA axis (22Bjorntorp P. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1995; 44: 21-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine if pituitary OB-R might play a role in HPA axis activation by inducing ACTH release, the effect of OB on ACTH release from the pituitary was assessed. Superfusion with recombinant OB significantly increased ACTH release from pituitary slices (Fig. 4 A). This effect of OB on ACTH release was specific, because it was blocked by anti-OB antibodies (Fig. 4 B). In humans, serum OB concentrations correlate positively with the percentage of body fat (41Considine R.V. Sinha M.K. Heiman M.L. Kriauciunas A. Stephens T.W. Nyce M.R. Ohanessian J.P. Cheryl B.S.N. Marco C.C. McKee L.J. Bauer T.L. Caro J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (5501) Google Scholar, 42McGregor G.P. Desaga J.F. Ehlenz K. Fischer A. Heese F. Hegele A. Lammer C. Peiser C. Lang R.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The expression of the short and long forms of the OB-R in the pituitary and the OB-induced ACTH release from the pituitary identified here may play an important role in the development and maintenance of obesity. OB-induced increases in ACTH release could be directly responsible for the elevated glucocorticoid levels often found in obesity (22Bjorntorp P. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1995; 44: 21-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid receptors are colocalized in CRF cells in the PVN of the hypothalamus (26Pacak K. Palkovits M. Kopin I.J. Goldstein D.S. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 89-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and glucocorticoids can inhibit hypothalamic CRF synthesis/release via negative feedback (43Plotsky P.M. Thrivikraman K.V. Watts A.G. Hauger R.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of severely elevated plasma OB, as found in obese individuals, two major effects could prevent OB from reducing body weight via enhanced CRF release (Fig.5). First, because the pituitary is not shielded from the systemic circulation by the blood-brain barrier, blood-derived OB would enhance pituitary ACTH release, increase glucocorticoid levels and, via negative feedback, decrease hypothalamic CRF release. Second, direct stimulatory OB effects on hypothalamic CRF release depend on efficient transport of OB across the blood-brain barrier, and there is evidence that this process may become increasingly inefficient as plasma OB levels rise above a critical level. A saturable transport system for OB from blood to brain has been described (44Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Huang W. Jaspan J.B. Maness L.M. Peptides. 1996; 17: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid to plasma OB levels shows also signs of saturability when plasma OB levels rise to levels seen in obesity (45Schwartz M.W. Peskind E. Raskind M. Boyko E.J. Porte Jr., D. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar,46Caro J.F. Kolaczynski J.W. Nyce M.R. Ohanessian J.P. Opentanova I. Goldman W.H. Lyn R.R. Zhang P.L. Sinha M.K. Considine R.V. Lancet. 1996; 348: 159-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). In addition to the data presented here, a number of other studies also support the disturbed negative feedback circuitry proposed in Fig. 5. In obese fa/fa rats with high corticosterone levels, hypothalamic CRF content and portal secretion of CRF are reduced, and adrenalectomy in these animals results in enhanced portal CRF secretion (17Nakaishi S. Nakai Y. Fukata J. Naito Y. Usui T. Imura H. Int. J. Obes. 1990; 14: 951-955PubMed Google Scholar, 43Plotsky P.M. Thrivikraman K.V. Watts A.G. Hauger R.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Adrenalectomy also eliminates hyperphagia and excessive weight gain in obese fa/fa rats (23Yukimura Y. Bray G.A. Wolfsen A.R. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 1924-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as in obese rats with ventromedial hypothalamic lesions (24Mook D.G. Fisher J.C. Durr J.C. Horm. Behav. 1975; 6: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) andob/ob mice (25Saito M. Bray G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R20-R25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lastly, treatment of such adrenalectomized models with glucocorticoids restores the obese phenotype (23Yukimura Y. Bray G.A. Wolfsen A.R. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 1924-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Mook D.G. Fisher J.C. Durr J.C. Horm. Behav. 1975; 6: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Saito M. Bray G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R20-R25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated expression of both the short and long form of the OB-R in the hypothalamus, as well as in the amygdala and pituitary. In addition, OB was shown to induce CRF release from the hypothalamus and amygdala and ACTH release from the pituitary. These data indicate that CRF and ACTH may function as key mediators of OB effects and emphasize the need to consider the differential effects of OB on multiple regions of the central nervous system in the design of OB-targeted treatments for obesity.

https://openalex.org/W1976821675,"Cancer-related, mucin-type carbohydrate epitopes, principally mannose and sialo-syl residues, are expressed on the envelope protein gp 160 of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Anticarbohydrate antibodies directed toward these and other carbohydrate epitopes are known to neutralize HIV-1 infection by cell-free virus. Carbohydrates, however, being T cell-independent antigens, typically elicit diminished immune responses. To overcome this potential draw back, we have examined the ability of peptides that mimic such epitopes to elicit immune responses that cross-react with carbohydrate structures. We report that mouse polyclonal antisera generated against peptides that mimic mucin-related carbohydrate epitopes have anti-HIV-1 activity. Generation of antibodies was not lr-gene restricted, as at least two different strains of mice. Balb/c (H-2d) and C57Bl/6 (H-2b), responded equally to the peptides. The antipeptide sera displayed neutralizing activity against HIV-I/MN and HIV-I/3B viral strains. This neutralization was as good as human anti-HIV sera. These results indicate that peptide mimics of carbohydrates provide a novel strategy for the further development of reagents that elicit immune responses to carbohydrate epitopes associated with many infectious organisms and tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007404754,"Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are conserved modules which participate in protein interaction by recognizing proline-rich motifs on target molecules. To identify new SH3-containing proteins, we performed a two-hybrid screen with a proline-rich region of human SOS-1. One of the specific SOS-1 interacting clones that were isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library defines a new protein that was named amphiphysin 2 because of its homology to the previously reported amphiphysin. Amphiphysin 2 is expressed in a number of mouse tissues through multiple RNA transcripts. Here, we report the amino acid sequence of a brain form of amphiphysin2 (BRAMP2) encoded by a 2.5-kilobase mRNA. BRAMP2 associates in vitro with elements of the endocytosis machinery such as α-adaptin and dynamin. On a biosensor surface, the BRAMP2/dynamin interaction appeared to be direct and partly dependent on a proline-rich sequence of dynamin. Association with dynamin was also observed in PC12 cells after cell stimulation with nerve growth factor, suggesting that amphiphysin 2 may be connected to receptor-dependent signaling pathways. This hypothesis is strengthened by the ability of BRAMP2 to interact with the p21 ras exchange factor SOS, in vitro, as a possible point of interconnection between the endocytic and signaling pathways.

A limited set of protein modules mediates molecular interactions and underlies the diversity of intracellular signaling pathways.

Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar). A common feature of SH3 domains is their ability to bind proline-rich sequences on target molecules. A SH3 domain is composed of a hydrophobic binding pocket with finely positioned aromatic residues and charged loops outside of this pocket that determine the specificity of the interaction with proline-rich motifs. Phage display or peptide library screenings with individual SH3 domains demonstrated the absence of a strict exclusivity for SH3 and proline-rich partners (2Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 3Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This feature may be the basis for the identification of new SH3-containing proteins. Human SOS-1 C terminus contains a multitude of intermingled proline-rich motifs. It was used as a “pseudo-degenerated” bait in search for new SH3 domains in a two-hybrid screen. Several SH3 domains were isolated, and one of them allowed us to identify a new protein, homologous to, but different from, amphiphysin (4Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kiliman M.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), that was named amphiphysin 2. Amphiphysin is a strictly neuronal protein that plays a crucial role in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (5David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A current hypothesis suggests that a ubiquitous homologue involved in general endocytosis should exist. We show here that this hypothesis is correct and incomplete. Amphiphysin 2 is expressed under several forms: a 2.0-kb transcript which is expressed almost ubiquitously and a 2.5-kb transcript that is brain-specific. The latter form was further characterized in vitro and in vivo. We show that the brain form of amphiphysin 2(BRAMP2) retains the same interactive abilities as amphiphysin itself,i.e. it binds dynamin and α-adaptin in vitro.In vivo, PC12 amphiphysin 2 co-immunoprecipitates with dynamin when cells have been stimulated with NGF. Thus, the interaction of PC12 amphiphysin 2 with key players of the endocytosis machinery is dependent on the stimulation of a signaling pathway initiated by NGF binding to its membrane receptor. The interconnection between endocytosis and membrane receptor signaling is further supported by the ability of brain amphiphysin 2 to interact with SOS in vitroas well as within the yeast two-hybrid system. This result brings evidence for an additional level of molecular interaction between endocytosis and signal transduction pathways, supporting the idea that both pathways may be mutually regulated. Briefly, a fusion between the GAL4-binding domain and the C-terminal portion of human SOS-1 (hSOS-1, AA 1131–1333 into the pGBT10 vector) (6Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. Aelst L.V.

The cDNA inserts from His+/LacZ+ specific clones were sequenced with an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., model 373A). One of them was hybridized to a mouse brain λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA inserts were subcloned into pBluescriptSK− for automatic sequencing. Hybridizations were performed sequentially with three random-primed 32P-labeled probes corresponding to bp 1283–1581, bp 1824–2374 of the full-length BRAMP2, and β-actin, using mouse multi-tissue RNA blots from CLONTECH, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A central fragment of BRAMP2 cDNA corresponding to AA 178–511 (bp 784–1784) was subcloned into pGEX4T1 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and pMalC2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to produce a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein, respectively. The full coding sequence of BRAMP2 (bp 250–2506) was subcloned into pGEX4T1. After production in Escherichia coli, GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and MBP fusion proteins were purified on amylose resin. Rabbit Ab were produced against GST-BRAMP2 (AA 178–511) and affinity-purified over a HiTrap NHS-activated column (Pharmacia) to which MBP-BRAMP2 (AA 178–511) had been covalently linked, before use in biochemical experiments. Rat brain dynamin was purified according to Gout et al. (9Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D.

A dynamin I peptide, GPPPQVPSRPNR, was synthesized in a solid-phase method on an Applied Biosystems apparatus and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.

Human SOS-1 and SOS-2 subcloned into pBluescriptSK− were used as DNA templates in a transcription/translation reaction with reticulocyte lysates and T7 RNA polymerase. Luciferase DNA provided by the manufacturer was used as control (Promega, Madison, WI). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were incubated with either GST-BRAMP2 (full coding sequence) or with GST, bound to glutathione beads. After washing in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, samples were separated by electrophoresis and autoradiographed. Mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells or rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were incubated with either GST-BRAMP2 (full coding sequence) or GST, both of them purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing in lysis buffer, proteins bound to beads were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-dynamin (1/1000) or -α-adaptin mAb (1/1000). Bound Ab were detected by peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse Ab and the ECL system (Amersham, Alesbury, UK). BRAMP2 (bp 250–2506) was subcloned into pRK5. Subconfluent 3T3 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pRK5-BRAMP2 or pRK5 plasmids per 100-mm dish, using a modified calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (10Zalcman G.

After transfection, cells were grown for 36 h and lysed in Triton X-100-containing buffer. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were used as cell extracts, next to PC12 cell extracts and mouse brain extracts for immunoblotting with anti-BRAMP2 Ab (0.5 μg/ml). Serum-deprived PC12 cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml NGF (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C, before lysis in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Chaps. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was precleared on protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) and incubated with anti-BRAMP2 Ab previously bound to protein A beads. After washing in lysis buffer, proteins bound to beads were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose before immunoblot analysis, as mentioned above. Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes prepared from a normal human male was carried out according to a usual technique, using R-banding (11Cherif D. Julier C. Delattre O. Derré J. Lathrop G.M. Berger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6639-6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The probe was a BRAMP2 DNA fragment from λgt10 screening (bp 305–2530). SPR experiments were carried out on a Biosensor BIAcore 2000 apparatus (Pharmacia Biosensor). Dynamin or GST-BRAMP2 in 10 mm potassium acetate buffer, pH 4.0 and pH 5.25, respectively, were covalently bound to the dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip, according to a method previously described (12Panayotou G. Gish G. End P. Truong O. Gout I. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Hiles I. Pawson T. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3567-3576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C with a flow rate of 20 or 30 μl/min, in HBS running buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% surfactant P20). Control experiments were performed with a blank cell allowing us to measure the resonance units due to injected proteins that were subtracted from the specific binding values. After each binding experiment, the sensor chip was regenerated with 10 μl of 3m guanidinium chloride. Estimation of kinetic parameters was done by repetitive injections of a range of protein concentrations over different densities of immobilized partner. Data analysis was performed with the interactive software BIA evaluation version 2.0. To identify new SH3-containing molecules, we performed a two-hybrid screen with a proline-rich region of hSOS-1 and a mouse brain cDNA library. One of the specific SOS-1 interacting clones was subsequently used to screen a mouse brain λgt10 cDNA library, and positive overlapping inserts were sequenced. The 2.5-kb full-length sequence, BRAMP2, contains an open reading frame of 1765 bp (bp 250–2014, data not shown) encoding a protein of 588 AA. The first methionine following an in-frame stop codon is within a good Kozak consensus sequence. Analysis of the predicted AA sequence revealed an SH3 domain in the C-terminal part of the molecule (AA 520 to 588) and two proline-rich motifs (AA 297–306 and AA 340–346) that could be seen as internal SH3-binding sites. Comparison of BRAMP2 with data base sequences demonstrated significant homology to human amphiphysin (4Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kiliman M.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), with a 42% identity at the AA level. The BRAMP2 DNA fragment allowed us to localize the corresponding gene in human 2q21 (data not shown), a locus different from 7p13-p14 defined for amphiphysin. Based on its sequence similarity to amphiphysin, we named the product of this gene, amphiphysin 2, another member of the “amphiphysin family.” Data base analysis also revealed that BRAMP2 is similar to recently reported sequences, murine SH3P9 (13Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and human BIN1 (14Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nature Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), with portions of almost complete identity in the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecules. This suggests that BRAMP2, SH3P9, and BIN1 are three splicing isoforms of the same genomic sequence. With a 108-AA central insert absent in the latter two molecules, BRAMP2 is structurally closer to amphiphysin. A mouse multi-tissue RNA blot was hybridized with a first BRAMP2 probe (bp 1824–2374) possibly recognizing multiple amphiphysin 2 isoforms and with a second probe (bp 1283–1581) corresponding to the 108-AA central insert. As shown in Fig.2 A, amphiphysin 2 mRNAs are expressed in a number of tissues tested: brain, muscle, liver, lung, spleen, and kidney, as 2.0- and 2.5-kb messengers. In contrast to amphiphysin, amphiphysin 2 expression does not appear to be restricted to neuronal cells. Nonetheless, the splicing isoform corresponding to the BRAMP2 cDNA shows a more restricted pattern of expression and is mostly expressed in brain as a 2.5-kb RNA (Fig. 2 B). A control β-actin probe indicates that variations in the detection of messengers cannot be due to differences in RNA loading (Fig.2 C). As detected by Western blotting, the expression of pRK5-BRAMP2 in NIH-3T3 transfected cells produces a doublet of polypeptides migrating at 88/96 kDa, an apparent molecular mass different from the theoretical 64.5 kDa (Fig. 2 D). This difference is probably due to post-translational modifications that may also account for the protein doublet since no particular cleavage site has been localized in the sequence. Such a doublet can also be detected in a PC12 cell extract as well as in a mouse brain extract, reinforcing the idea that this amphiphysin 2 isoform is expressed in neuronal cell types. Anti-BRAMP2 Ab were able to recognize other polypeptides in NIH-3T3 cells, probably because the portion of BRAMP2 used for Ab production is common to multiple isoforms. These 57- and 67-kDa polypeptides could represent different splicing isoforms of amphiphysin 2 such as BIN1, which was reported to be a 70-kDa molecule (14Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nature Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The BRAMP2 cDNA was first isolated in a two-hybrid screen with the proline-rich region of SOS-1. To confirm the yeast genetic data, we tested in vitro binding of GST-BRAMP2 to35S-labeled SOS-1 and -2. As shown in Fig.3 A, GST-BRAMP2 bound SOS-1 and -2, whereas GST did not. The specificity of the interaction was further confirmed by using 35S-luciferase, unable to interact with either GST-BRAMP2 or GST. These in vitro data are consistent with the yeast two-hybrid result and further show that the interaction between brain amphiphysin 2 and SOS is direct. Thereafter, we tested the ability of brain amphiphysin 2 to interact with previously reported partners of amphiphysin: dynamin and α-adaptin. 3T3 cell extracts were incubated with GST-BRAMP2 or GST, and bound proteins were detected by immunoblot. As shown in Fig.3 B (left panel), anti-dynamin mAb was able to specifically recognize the 100-kDa dynamin in GST-BRAMP2 samples. Identical results were obtained with PC12 cell extracts (data not shown). Similarly, a 110/115-kDa doublet of α-adaptins was specifically retained by GST-BRAMP2 beads (Fig. 3 B,right panel) and detected by anti-α-adaptin mAb. For both immunodetections, the specificity of the interaction was confirmed by using Sepharose beads loaded with equivalent amounts of GST as negative control. The in vitro interaction between BRAMP2 and dynamin was strengthened by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. After lysis of PC12 cells in mild conditions (1.0% Chaps), an anti-BRAMP2 immunoprecipitate was shown to contain the 100-kDa dynamin when cells had previously been stimulated with NGF. In the same lysis conditions, amphiphysin 2 immunoprecipitated from unstimulated PC12 cells was not associated with dynamin (Fig. 3 B, central panel). Taken together, these results strongly link the BRAMP2 form of amphiphysin 2 to the endocytic pathway, as was previously reported for amphiphysin. To further study BRAMP2/dynamin interaction, we have used a SPR assay with a BIAcore Biosensor. This method allowed us to detect molecular interactions in real time and to estimate their kinetic parameters. Fig.4 A shows the direct binding of increasing concentrations of GST-BRAMP2 to immobilized dynamin (from 0 to 300 s), followed by a dissociation phase (300 to 600 s). Control GST did not give any specific binding on the dynamin sensor (data not shown). The association rate for GST-BRAMP2, k a = 1.5 × 104m−1s−1, was calculated from the slope of a plot ofk s against GST-BRAMP2 concentration (Fig.4 B). The dissociation rate in buffer flow was near 0 and could not be studied by dynamin injection because of the oligomerization of the molecule. To prevent this problem, the dissociation rate was measured after binding of 0.5 μmdynamin to a GST-BRAMP2-coated membrane by injection of 1 μm GST-BRAMP2 (Fig. 4 C). Repetitive experiments gave two dissociation rate constant values on the order ofk d1 = 1.6 × 10−1 s−1and k d2 = 3.5 × 10−3s−1. However, when low concentrations of dynamin were used, the faster dissociation rate was not observed, suggesting that it could represent dynamin aggregation on the sensor. The equilibrium dissociation constant was thus calculated with k d2 as kDa = k d /k a ≈ 240 nm. As shown in Fig. 4 D, BRAMP2/dynamin interaction could be inhibited partially by the GPPPQVPSRPNR peptide from dynamin, involving this particular proline-rich motif and the SH3 domain of BRAMP2 in the association between both molecules. We have defined a new SH3-containing molecule, highly homologous to amphiphysin. It is encoded by a gene located in human chromosome 2q21, a locus different from the 7p13-14 identified for amphiphysin. Based on its similarity to amphiphysin, the product of this gene was named amphiphysin 2. Unlike amphiphysin, it has a broad expression in several mouse tissues and may be seen as a ubiquitous amphiphysin homologue. In patients with stiff-man syndrome associated with breast cancer (15De Camilli P. Thomas A. Cofiell R. Folli F. Lichte B. Piccolo G. Meinck H.M. Austoni M. Fassetta G. Bottazzo G. Bates D. Cartlidge N. Solimena M. Kiliman M.W. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2219-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), it is a potential target outside the brain for anti-amphiphysin autoantibodies. From one mouse tissue to the other, the expression of amphiphysin 2 seems to be dependent on multiple transcripts, generated either by different sites of initiation/polyadenylation or by alternative splicing. One of these transcripts encodes the BRAMP2 sequence that we report herein. Shorter transcripts should be related to the previously reported SH3P9 (13Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and BIN1 (14Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nature Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) sequences which are identical to BRAMP2 in their N- and C-terminal ends. BRAMP2, SH3P9, and BIN1 are probably three splicing variants of the same genomic sequence that may give rise to functionally diverse molecules. For example, BIN1 was reported to have a short nuclear localization signal absent in the other isoforms and a Myc-binding domain maintained in the other isoforms (14Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nature Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). BRAMP2 has a long central insert absent in SH3P9 and BIN1 that makes it structurally closer to amphiphysin and correlates with a brain-restricted expression. It remains to be determined whether the same brain cell types express amphiphysin and this form of amphiphysin 2. We have shown that BRAMP2 associates in vitro with key elements of the endocytic pathway: α-adaptin and dynamin from 3T3 as well as from PC12 cells. The interaction with dynamin is direct and likely to rely on the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 2 on one side and on a proline-rich sequence of dynamin on the other side. This conclusion is based on molecular interactions studied on a BIAcore biosensor where a proline-rich peptide of dynamin I corresponding to one of the previously described Grb2-binding sites is partially inhibitory (9Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This suggests that BRAMP2 interacts at least in part with this proline-rich sequence. The affinity of BRAMP2/dynamin interaction on the biosensor membrane was estimated in the 240 nm range, revealing an affinity similar to other SH3 domain/protein ligand interactions (17Lee C.H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and much higher than what have been described with proline-rich peptide ligands (18Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The association of brain amphiphysin 2 with dynamin was also detected in vivo after stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF. This result shows that interaction of amphiphysin 2 with a protein of the endocytosis machinery is dependent on a signaling event coming from a cell surface receptor. A number of previous reports demonstrated that the organization of the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery is tightly controlled by the activation of the surface receptors that are going to be endocytosed, as part of signal attenuation. First, endocytosis is dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the receptor (19Sorkin A. Waters C. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Second, ligand binding stimulates the interaction of activated receptors with the AP2 complex on one hand (20Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and with dynamin through signal transduction molecules on the other hand (21Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Grb2 is an important element in this cascade that was reported to interact with dynamin upon ligand binding and stimulate dynamin GTPase activity, possibly by promoting dynamin self-association (9Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that upon receptor stimulation, amphiphysin 2 joins the multimolecular complex located at the cytoplasmic end of the receptor. The possible competition between amphiphysin 2 and Grb2 for dynamin binding can be reconciled in a sequential scheme involving phosphorylation- or nucleotide binding-dependent changes of conformation. Inside the multimolecular complex depicted above, elements of the endocytic pathway are intimately associated with elements of the signaling pathway. Cumulative evidence suggests that both pathways regulate each other, at multiple levels (23Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Even though we need to confirm it in vivo in mammalian cells, our ability to detect an interaction between the brain form of amphiphysin 2 and the p21 ras exchange factor SOS, brings further support to the interconnection between both pathways, at the site of receptor stimulation. We are currently testing whether a ternary complex of amphiphysin 2/SOS/dynamin exists in vivo and defines a new point of functional interaction, regulating endocytic function as well as signaling function."
https://openalex.org/W2043010810,"Intron excision is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms by which the spliceosome accurately identifies splice sites in nuclear precursors to messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) are not well understood. A bimolecular assay for the second step of splicing has now revealed that exon ligation by the human spliceosome does not require covalent attachment of a 3' splice site to the branch site. Furthermore, accurate definition of the 3' splice site in this system is independent of either a covalently attached polypyrimidine tract or specific 3' exon sequences. Rather, in this system 3' splice site selection apparently occurs with a 5' --> 3' directionality."
https://openalex.org/W2333943017,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is an important growth factor for neuroectoderm- and mesoderm-derived cells. In addition bFGF is an important angiogenic factor and appears to contribute to tumorigenesis. This is exemplified by the fact that bFGF is expressed in a large majority of human gliomas and that bFGF expression is critical for the growth and tumorigenesis of these cells. It has been shown previously that bFGF can induce its own expression through an increase in bFGF mRNA. In this report, we show that bFGF leads to its own synthesis through an autoregulated transcriptional response that requires the transcription factor Egr-1 (also known as Krox24, Zif268 and NGFI-A). Egr-1 binds to two DNA elements in the bFGF promoter and positively regulates transcription. Mutation of these sites blocks the ability of bFGF to transcriptionally regulate the bFGF promoter. These data indicate a mechanism to explain how bFGF functions to autoregulate its expression and demonstrate that Egr-1 is as an essential transcription factor in this process."

To determine whether oncoproteins E6 and E7 of HPV-16 are responsible for the higher mutation frequency of the plasmids, we measured the mutation frequency in NHOK and in NHOK expressing the HPV-16 oncogenes (E6, E7, or E6 plus E7). We also measured the mutation frequency in NHOK expressing the E6 or E7 proteins of the non-oncogenic HPV-6b. The mutation frequency, either background or N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced, in NHOK expressing the HPV-16 oncoproteins (E6, E7, or E6 plus E7) was significantly higher than in NHOK. The HPV-16 oncogenes did not alter the nature of the MNNG-induced mutations (G : C→A : T), but increased the frequency of deletions and insertions with or without MNNG. The background or MNNG-induced mutation frequency in NHOK expressing the HPV-6b E6 or E7 proteins was the same as in NHOK. NHOK and NHOK expressing HPV6b-E6 or E7 were able to arrest the cell cycle and enhance cellular p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, and Gadd45 levels when exposed to MNNG, whereas NHOK expressing the HPV-16 E6 oncogene did not demonstrate. NHOK expressing HPV-16 E7 were able to enhance cellular p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, and Gadd45 levels, but failed to arrest cell cycle progression when exposed to MNNG. These data indicate that HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes are mutagenic in human oral keratinocytes and enhance the mutagenic effect of MNNG. However, the E6 and E7 proteins of the `low risk' HPV-6b did not demonstrate such an ability."
https://openalex.org/W2318200016,"We and others have shown that the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein binds activators of the Ras pathway such as Grb2 and Shc. Grb2 binding is mediated through a phosphorylated tyrosine residue (Y177) located within a consensus Grb2 binding site encoded by the first exon of the BCR gene. Our results indicate that P160 BCR is tyrosine phosphorylated at the same site by Bcr-Abl in kinase assays (Puil et al., 1994). We performed experiments to determine whether Bcr, which was tyrosine phosphorylated within cells by activated c-Abl, could also bind Grb2, and whether phosphotyrosine 177 was the major binding site. Complexes between Bcr and Abl were detected in a hemopoietic cell line lacking Bcr-Abl and in COS1 cells coexpressing both Bcr and Abl proteins. P160 BCR was tyrosine phosphorylated in COS1 cells coexpressing Abl and Bcr proteins. Similarly, various deletion mutants of Bcr including BCRN553, BCRN413 and BCRN221 were tyrosine phosphorylated by activated c-Abl whereas BCRN159 was not. Wild-type Bcr and Bcr Y177F were examined under these conditions for their ability to co-precipitate with Grb2. The results showed that while wild-type tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr efficiently bound Grb2, tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr Y177F had greatly reduced Grb2-binding ability. Studies with GST-SH2 (Grb2) revealed that tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr was able to bind to GST SH2 (Grb2) but tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr Y177F was deficient in binding. These results indicate that the Bcr protein when phosphorylated at tyrosine 177 binds Grb2, thereby implicating Bcr as a potantial activator of the Ras pathway."

However, recent studies indicate that this subunit is bound close to the top of the F1, at an α-β interface, where it binds to the F0 part by interaction with the b subunit (12Lill H. Heusel F.

Turina P. Bustamante C.J. Keller D.J. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Each c molecule is folded as a helical hairpin (15Girvin M.E.

A key residue of the c subunit is Asp61.

How many of the c subunits are involved in the interaction between the F0 and γ and ε subunits is not known. To examine this question, we have reacted Cys residues introduced into this polar loop region with [14C]NEM. Our results show two types of c subunits within the ring: a group of 4–5 c subunits that are shielded from reaction with the maleimide by interaction of F1 subunits, and a second group of 6–7 c subunits that are more readily accessible for modification. NEM reaction of these two groups affected functioning differently, and this has significance for the mechanism of energy coupling within ECF1F0. Mutants cA39C, cA40C, cQ42C, cP43C, and cD44C have been described previously (6Watts S.D. Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The purification of ECF1F0 from these mutants was according to Aggeler et al. (21Aggeler R. Zhang Y.-Z. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7107-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of ECF1F0 into egg lecithin vesicles was as described previously (7Watts S.D Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) for the vesicles used in ACMA fluorescence quenching assays. F0 was prepared by KSCN extraction of purified F1F0 after reconstitution into egg lecithin vesicles (22Aggeler R. Weinreich F. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The F0 was resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mmMgCl2) by washing twice by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. [14C]NEM was added to ECF1F0 and ECF0 at 1 and 0.3 mg/ml of protein, respectively, in Buffer A. For time course experiments, an aliquot was removed immediately, 2% SDS was added to act as a control for full incorporation, and this was incubated for 2 h at 22 °C. At the times indicated, aliquots were removed and the NEM reaction stopped by incubating at 22 °C for 30 min with 50 mm DTT. The data were analyzed using a curve fit that assumed two independent rates for Cys alkylation with the KaleidaGraph data analysis and graphing program. The equation used is:P 1 + P 2 =A·D − B·D exp (−k 1·N·t) −C·D exp (−k 2·N·t), whereP 1 and P 2 = the proportion of group1-NEM adduct and group2-NEM adduct, respectively; A = B +C = 100; k 1 andk 2 = second-order rate constants for group1 and group2, respectively;N = initial NEM concentration; D = protein concentration; and t = time. The quantitation of the incorporation of [14C]NEM into the c subunits was as described previously (22Aggeler R. Weinreich F. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The percentage of the Cys in all c subunits that reacted with [14C]NEM after different treatments was determined on the basis of the total incorporation of the maleimide into the appropriate detergent-solubilized control sample incubated with 800 μm [14C]NEM for 2 h at 22 °C to ensure full labeling. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mm DTT. ECF1F0 reconstituted in egg lecithin vesicles suspended in Buffer A (0.5 mg/ml protein) was reacted with 50 μm DCCD for 1 h at 22 °C. Aliquots were then mixed with equal volumes of various concentrations of NEM dissolved in DMSO, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 600 μm DTT with incubation at 22 °C for 30 min. Samples were assayed for ATPase activity in 5 mm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2as described previously (24Lötscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4134-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Samples treated with NEM were reacted with 600 μm DTT for 30 min to quench the maleimide reaction, and then 20 μg of protein from each sample was assayed for ACMA fluorescence quenching as described previously (22Aggeler R. Weinreich F. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) at 1 mm ATP and 2 mmMgCl2. Samples for SDS-PAGE were mixed with a one-half volume of dissociation buffer (10% SDS, 0.6 mTris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol) and 50 mm DTT and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Polypeptides were separated using a 10–22% linear gradient (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R according to the method of Downer et al. (26Downer N.W. Robinson N.C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay from Pierce. [14C]NEM was obtained from DuPont NEN (40 mCi/mmol). Five different mutants (cA39C, cA40C, cQ42C, cP43C, and cD44C) were used in this study. ECF1F0 isolated from each of these mutants had activities in the range of 25–33 μmol ATP hydrolyzed per min/mg, and each mutant was DCCD sensitive (85% or more inhibition on addition of 50 μm DCCD). Enzyme from each of the mutants was reconstituted into proteoliposomes at a ratio of protein to lipid of 1:2 (w/w) and the reactivity of the Cys introduced at different positions in the polar loop region of the c subunits examined by [14C]NEM labeling. For each mutant, NEM incorporation into the c subunits of native ECF1F0 was compared with that of enzyme complex dissolved in 2% SDS. The labeling of dissociated and detergent-denatured ECF1F0 should be a measure of the number of copies of the c subunit in the complex when related to the labeling of those subunits with known stoichiometry. The α and β subunits are present in 3 copies each and have 4 and 1 intrinsic Cys respectively. When the counts/min incorporated into the α subunit was used as a control (by dividing by 12), the amount of β subunits estimated in several experiments with each of the five mutants was the same, i.e. 3.1 ± 0.3 mol. The number of c subunits calculated by the same approach was 9.8 ± 0.2 (three experiments) for cA39C, 12.2 ± 0.5 for cA40C (three experiments), 11.0 ± 1.3 (nine experiments) for cQ42C, 9.4 ± 0.6 (three experiments) for cP43C, and 12.2 ± 0.9 (four experiments) for cD44C. The variability in these values could be due to several factors. There may be small differences in the binding efficiency of the F1 to F0 in the various mutants. Any loss of F1during the handling before gel electrophoresis, which includes centrifugation steps, would increase the observed number of c subunits relative to α or β. In contrast, irreversible cross-linking of c subunits into homodimers or with other subunits, e.g. γ and ε, which are known to be formed in some mutants (see Ref. 7Watts S.D Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), would underestimate the number of c subunits when the value is determined by counting the monomer c band. Because of the observed variability, data for each mutant were analyzed separately, and the labeling of c subunits in the native complex is reported as a percentage of the labeling in SDS for that mutant. To compare the relative reactivity of Cys at different positions in the c subunit loop, native ECF1F0from each of the mutants was reacted with 100 μm[14C]NEM for 1 h at room temperature. Fig.1 summarizes the results obtained. The labeling of the Cys at positions 39 and 40 was negligible. In contrast, Cys at position 43 or 44 was labeled completely under the reaction conditions chosen. With the mutant cQ42C, only around 70% of the c subunits were labeled, implying that in this mutant, there are two populations of c subunits, one class that reacts readily and a second class that is protected from labeling. In Fig. 1, the shaded bars show the labeling of F0 preparations from the various Cys mutants. After the removal of the F1 part, the Cys at 39 and 40 remained unreactive, indicating that these residues are not buried by contact with F1 subunits but, instead, either by protein-protein contacts within the F0 or by lipid-protein interactions. After removal of F1 from the mutant cQ42C, all of the c subunits became reactive to NEM. The reactivity of the c subunit in ECF1F0 from the mutant cQ42C was examined in more detail by both concentration dependences and time courses of [14C]NEM labeling. Fig. 2 Ashows the reaction of the c subunit in this mutant with 0–200 μm NEM. Modification of all of the c subunits occurred at significantly lower NEM concentrations in the isolated F0than in the intact F1F0 complex. A time course of reaction of c subunits in ECF1F0 with 100 μm [14C]NEM is presented in Fig.2 B. Two phases of the reaction were observed. A fraction of the c subunits reacted less readily than the remainder. The best fit to these kinetic data was obtained with 60% of the c subunits reacting at the same rate of 62 s−1m−1, and 40% reacting with a second rate of 1.5 s−1m−1. When c subunits were reacted with NEM under identical conditions, but in isolated F0, all reacted rapidly, with a rate of 94 s−1m−1. For comparison, 100% of c subunits of ECF1F0 from the mutant cD44C reacted with [14C]NEM at one rate of 100 s−1m−1. The activity effects of NEM modification of the Cys at position 42 of the c subunit was examined as a function of the percentage of c subunits reacted. The extent of the modification was established by altering the concentrations of NEM used (as in Fig.2 A). Reaction of all copies of Cys42 (obtained by prolonged incubation at 200 μm NEM) caused 30% reduction in the rate of ATP hydrolysis. DCCD inhibition of ATPase activity is also shown in Fig. 3. NEM incorporation of 60% of the c subunits had essentially no effect. However, when the extent of labeling was increased above this amount, DCCD inhibition of ATP hydrolysis was progressively lost. The effect of NEM modification on ATP hydrolysis-coupled proton translocation by ECF1F0 from cQ42C is presented in Fig. 4. Modification of the more reactive c subunits (curve 2) had very little effect on ATP-driven proton translocation as measured by the ACMA fluorescence quenching assay. However, when the modification of c subunits exceeded 60%, coupled proton translocation was essentially lost (curves 3–5). We have been using mutants of ECF1F0 in which Cys residues have been introduced into various subunits to probe structure-function relationships, using cross-linkers (e.g.Ref. 27Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), binding fluorescent probes (e.g. Ref. 28Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14275-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), or, as in this study, by monitoring the reactivity of the Cys and the effect of the modification on functioning (see also Ref. 29Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the arrangement and role of the polar loop region of the c subunits by taking advantage of various mutants that have a Cys at residue position 39, 40, 42, 43, or 44 in this loop (7Watts S.D Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Position 41 is a highly conserved Arg, and its replacement destroys function, so this specific site was not studied here. A comparison of the reactivity of the introduced Cys to [14C]NEM in the native and denatured forms of ECF1F0 provides insight into the arrangement of the c subunit oligomer and into the interaction of the F1part with the F0. NMR data, as well as biochemical and genetic studies, have established that each c subunit in ECF1F0 is arranged as a helical hairpin with N- and C-terminal regions in the periplasmic space. The polar loop, which is predicted to include residues 39–44, is in the cytosol pointing toward the F1 part (18Fillingame R.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results show that residues 39 and 40 are buried, not by interaction of the F1 part, but either by lipid-protein interaction or protein-protein contacts within the F0 part. In the latter case, these must be interactions between c subunits given the low copy number of a and b subunits. The number of c subunits per ECF1F0 remains unclear; values of 10–12 have been reported (18Fillingame R.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Fillingame R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The labeling data here for enzyme denatured in SDS are no more definitive for technical reasons. The value obtained was different for each mutant, but in the range of 9.4–12.2. The key result of the present study is that the c subunits in ECF1F0 are not all equivalent, but fall into two classes based on the NEM reactivity of the Cys at position 42. On labeling of ECF1F0 from the mutant cQ42C, 60% of the c subunits reacted relatively rapidly with maleimide, all at a similar rate of around 62 s−1m−1. The other 40% reacted much more slowly (rates of 1.5 s−1m−1). These more slowly reacting c subunits are involved in F1 binding because after removal of the F1, all of the c subunits were equally accessible. No subset of shielded c subunits was observed on labeling ECF1F0 from mutants cP43C or cD44C with [14C]NEM, suggesting that the interaction of the F1 part with c subunits is relatively limited and involves mainly Arg41 and Gln42. The effect of NEM incorporation at position 42 on DCCD inhibition of ATP hydrolysis supports the idea that only a few of the c subunits interact with the F1 part. Modification of the faster reacting 60% of c subunits has little or no effect on the DCCD sensitivity of ATP hydrolysis in the mutant. However, with reaction of the last 40%, there was a progressive loss of the inhibition caused by the covalently bound carbodiimide. The implication is that NEM reaction with the more shielded Cys disrupts the F1F0interaction and causes loss of DCCD sensitivity. Genetic studies have shown that Gln42 can be replaced by Val, Ala, or Cys but not by more bulky side chains without disrupting the F1F0 interface (30Fraga D. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably the size difference between Cys and the Cys-NEM adduct is sufficient to alter binding of the γ and ε subunits with the c subunit oligomer. Reaction of the Cys at position 42 was also found to affect ATP-driven proton translocation in the mutant cQ42C. As the number of c subunits modified by NEM was increased, the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation as measured by ACMA fluorescence quenching was decreased. This assay is not quantitative, but it is clear that modification of more than 60% of the c subunits is required before proton pumping is greatly reduced. The uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis from proton translocation is explained if NEM modification of the Cys at position 42 disrupts the F1 and F0 interface. The question of how many c subunits are involved in binding of F1 to F0 is not answered absolutely by the present studies because of uncertainties about the stoichiometry of the c subunit in the complex. However, if there are 10 copies, 4 are involved, whereas if there are 12, then 5 are involved. The organization of c subunits in the F0 part remains to be defined precisely. However, the recent single-particle, atomic force microscopy studies show the c subunit oligomer as a ring within which is a pit (14Singh S. Turina P. Bustamante C.J. Keller D.J. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This would appear to preclude the idea that the c subunits are a tightly packed bundle with an inner core set that binds the F1 part. If, as proposed, the c subunits are arranged in a single ring, then the fact that two classes of c subunits can be detected in activity assays has important functional implications. The emerging model of the coupling of catalytic site events with proton translocation includes the rotation of the stalk subunits γ (31Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou H. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 32Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Wilkens S. Grüber G. J. Bio. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and ε (32Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Wilkens S. Grüber G. J. Bio. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This rotation of γ and ε could be relative to a fixed c subunit ring, or there could be concerted movements of a domain that includes both γ and ε subunits and the c oligomer. We have previously found that the cross linking of γ (via Cys at 205) to the c subunit ring does not significantly affect ATP hydrolysis rates. We interpreted these results in favor of a model in which the γ and ε subunits oligomers, along with the c subunit oligomer, move together (7Watts S.D Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results presented here are consistent with this idea. If the γ and ε subunits were moving relative to the c subunit ring, all of the c subunits should become equivalent during enzyme turnover and modification of any group of the c subunits by NEM should have the same overall effect. As a consequence, NEM incorporation into the faster-reacting class of c subunits would be expected to disrupt the F1F0interface as the γ-ε domain moves around to interact with these. This is not the case, as both the DCCD inhibition of ATPase activity and the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation are not lost until more than half of the c subunits have been modified. In summary, evidence is presented that 4 or 5 c subunits are involved in the binding of the γ and ε subunits to the F0. Furthermore, it appears that this interaction is fixed such that the γ and ε subunits do not switch between c subunits during functioning. Our working model is that rotational catalysis involves movements of a complex of the γ, ε, and c subunits and is relative to other parts of the F1 and F0 that are linked by a stator constituted by the δ and b subunits (see Ref.13Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2313714319,"The mechanisms by which seven transmembrane receptors activate p42mapk/p44mapk are not well defined although p21ras- and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathways have been implicated, typically for Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that in Rat-1 cells transfected with the Gq-coupled bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide receptor, bombesin stimulated activation of p42mapk that was not inhibited by the specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X or by down regulation of phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms. In addition, bombesin rapidly stimulated p74raf-1 activity that was also independent of PKC activity and insensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, addition of neuromedin B to Rat-1 cells transfected with the neuromedin B preferring receptor also activated p42mapk and p74raf-1 in a PKC-independent and pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Finally we show that addition of bombesin to Rat-1 cells stimulated the GTP loading of p21ras. Our results reveal a novel PKC-independent pathway in the action of Gq-coupled receptors and stress the importance of cell context in defining the signal transduction pathway(s) that link specific receptors to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade."

Multi-redox center proteins are involved in several reactions of energy transduction phenomena. The complexity of these proteins has hindered determination of their precise physicochemical mechanisms and the indispensable cross-assignment between each measurable parameters. Among these, multiheme cytochromes have an important role and have been extensively investigated. Discovery of a large number of multiheme cytochromes in sulfur and sulfate reducing bacteria led to the description of a cytochrome c 3 superfamily (1Bruschi M.

Three-dimensional structures of four different cytochromes c3 (M r 13,000) are available (Ref. 4Czjzek M. Payan F. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and references therein), as well as that of cytochrome c 3 (M r 26,000) (5Czjzek M. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Haser R. Structure. 1996; 4: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and recently of cytochrome c 7 (3Banci L. Bertini I. Bruschi M. Sompornpisut P. Turano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14396-14400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These analyses reveal that cytochrome c 3(M r 13,000) is the basic unit of this superfamily and that all these cytochromes may have a common ancestral origin (1Bruschi M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c 3 (M r 13000) is a periplasmic protein uniformly present in Desulfovibrio. To date, cytochromes c 3 fromDesulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, Desulfovibrio desulfuricansNorway, and Desulfovibrio gigas have been extensively studied in terms of both structural (4Czjzek M.

Despite low sequence identity, their three-dimensional structures are very well conserved, especially in terms of position and orientation of the heme core. Cytochrome c 3 (M r 26,000) was isolated from D. desulfuricans Norway (13Guerlesquin F. Bovier-Lapierre G. Bruschi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 530-538Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), D. gigas (14Bruschi M. Leroy G. Bonicel J. Campese D. Dolla A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and more recently from Desulfovibrio africanus (15Pieulle L. Haladjian J. Bonicel J. Hatchikian E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is a homodimer with four hemes per subunit bound to the polypeptide chain via two thioether bonds involving cysteine residues from the consensus sequence C-X2 or 4-C-H and two vinyl groups of the porphyrin. All four heme iron atoms in each subunit are coordinated by two imidazole nitrogen atoms of histidine residues, adopting a hexacoordinated low-spin form in both the oxidized and reduced states of the protein. The four heme groups have very low oxidoreduction midpoint potentials ranging from −220 to −370 mV (16Bruschi M. Loutfi M. Bianco P. Haladjian J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), enabling reduction of relatively poor oxidants in the sulfate reduction pathway. The three-dimensional structure of cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) from D. desulfuricansNorway has been solved at 2.16-Å resolution (5Czjzek M. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Haser R. Structure. 1996; 4: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each subunit displays the cytochrome c 3 fold with significant amino acid substitutions, relative to the tetraheme cytochromec 3, in the interface region. The orientation and relative arrangement of the heme core within each subunit is very similar to those of all tetraheme cytochromesc 3 (M r 13,000). The dimer contact is relatively small (6% of the total accessible surface) involving only 19 residues in each subunit. No salt-bridges are located at the interface but 16 hydrogen bonds are formed. In the case ofD. gigas, two disulfide bridges are present between the two subunits of the dimeric cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) (14Bruschi M. Leroy G. Bonicel J. Campese D. Dolla A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The heme 1 of each subunit are in close contact, the shortest distance between the heme edges being 5 Å. As it is the case for the cytochromesc 3 (M r 13,000), the heme 4 crevice is surrounded by several basic residues; 7 out of 11 lysine and arginine residues present in the cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) are located near heme 4 (17Czjzek M. Payan F. Haser R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of these polyheme cytochromes provide a basis for understanding the factors controlling the redox potential and therefore the intra- and inter-molecular electron transfer. Sequence alignments of the various cytochromesc 3 on the basis of the three-dimensional structures pointed out several highly conserved residues (17Czjzek M. Payan F. Haser R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in the heme environment that might play an important role in establishing the redox properties of the molecules. Aromatic residues might be of great importance as they are generally involved in influencing the redox potential, the electron transfer as well as the stability of the molecule. Tyrosine 73 is a highly conserved aromatic residue, positioned parallel to the plane of the sixth axial ligand to heme 4. Numerous studies have revealed the importance of this heme group in the interaction of the cytochrome c 3(M r 13,000) with various redox partners (18Guerlesquin F. Dolla A. Bruschi M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that slight alteration of its environment has a drastic influence on the interaction and electron transfer processes (19Dolla A. Florens L. Bianco P. Haladjian J. Voordouw G. Forest E. Wall J. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6340-6346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, tyrosine 73 is replaced by a glutamate residue in D. desulfuricansNorway cytochrome c 3 (M r13,000). This might be responsible for a totally different orientation of the axial ligand histidine planes that are almost perpendicular in the case of the D. desulfuricans Norway tetraheme cytochromec 3 (M r 13,000) and approximately parallel in the case of the octaheme cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) (5Czjzek M. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Haser R. Structure. 1996; 4: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In D. desulfuricans Norway cells, both cytochromec 3 (M r 13,000) and cytochrome c 3 (M r 26,000) are present and they have only 34.6% sequence identity (14Bruschi M. Leroy G. Bonicel J. Campese D. Dolla A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The physiological roles for multiple multiheme cytochromes in the same bacteria are unknown. In the case of the dimeric cytochrome, the role of heme 4 as well as the importance of the dimer formation in the molecule activity are unresolved. For insights into the physicochemical properties of cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) fromD. desulfuricans Norway and the importance of the highly conserved residues, we cloned its gene and performed site-directed mutagenesis. Here, we report the cloning of the cycD gene encoding cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) and its expression in a closely related sulfate reducing bacterium, D. desulfuricans G201. The influence of the replacement by site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 73 which is located in the heme 4 environment on the properties and activity of the molecule has also been studied. The bacterial strains and plasmids used are described in Table I. Growth ofEscherichia coli strains was carried out in TY medium (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic concentrated at 0.27 mm for ampicillin and 0.17 mm for kanamycin.E. coli DH5α and D. desulfuricans G201, required for conjugational transfer of broad-host range vectors, were grown as described previously (21Voordouw G. Pollock W.B.R. Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. Rapp-Giles B.J. Wall J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172 (2nd Ed.): 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D. desulfuricans Norway (NCIMB 8310) was grown at 37 °C in Starkey's medium. Large-scale growth of D. desulfuricans G201 recombinant strains was carried out in Postgate C medium (22Postgate J.R.

The radiochemical [α-35S]dATP (400 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from Amersham Corp. and used for dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Cloning and sequencing oligonucleotides were obtained from Genset (France).

BamHI DNA fragment from the chromosome of D. desulfuricans Norway.BamHI-digested chromosomal DNA of 1–2 kb was cloned into pUC18 and transformed into E. coli TG1. Potential recombinants were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplification using forward and reverse pUC oligonucleotides (Promega). Amplified products of about 1.5 kb were probed with the 33–44D degenerate oligonucleotide by Southern analysis to identify the cycDgene encoding cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000). One positive clone was called pUCC19. The oligonucleotide 48–55 (5′-gcagctttcaatggtatagg-3′) complementary to the sequence encoding 48TYTIESC55 of cytochrome c 3 (M r 26,000) was designed and used to clone genomic DNA downstream from the cytochrome c 3 (M r 26,000) encoding gene. Selection and cloning of a suitable fragment was performed as described above. A 1.5-kb fragment obtained from a doubleEcoRV-SacI digestion of the genomic DNA was selected and subsequently cloned into pUCBM21 (Boehringer Mannheim) cut with the same enzymes to obtain pUCC20. Both the 1.5-kbBamHI fragment from pUCC19 and the 1.5-kbEcoRI-SacI fragment from pUCC20 were subcloned into the replicative form of M13mp18 cut with the corresponding enzymes to give mp18C19 and mp18C20, respectively. Sequences from both strands were determined using the method by Sanger et al. (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). A 877-bp BamHI-SalI fragment, including thecycD gene, was isolated from pUCC19 and subcloned into M13mp18 cut with the same enzymes to get mp18CACC3. Total cellular RNA from D. desulfuricans Norway, D. desulfuricans G201 (pJRD215), and D. desulfuricans G201 (pCACC3) were prepared by the hot phenol method (25Aiba H. Adhya S. de Combrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA was denatured by incubation 15 min at 68 °C in 65% (v/v) formamide, 2.7 m formaldehyde, 1 × MOPS buffer (pH 7.0). RNA (15 μg) was electrophoretically separated using 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde in 1 × MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) run in the same buffer. RNA was then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane by capillarity blotting. Specific transcripts from the cycDgene were probed with an intragenic cycD 397-bp fragment nonisotopically labeled with DIG-11-dUTP by Northern analysis. The site-specific change in mp18CACC3 employed the Eckstein method (Amersham code RPN 1523). The mutagenic oligonucleotide P73 (5′-ggaaatttcctcggtcgaacggactttcc-3′) was designed to change the TAC codon at nucleotides 557–559 encoding Tyr73 within the cycD gene into GAA encoding E. The change was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The replicative form of mp18CACC3 carrying the Y73E mutation was called mp18CC3Y73E. The replicative forms of mp18CACC3 and mp18CC3Y73E were digested with both EcoRI and HindIII and the resulting 895-bp fragments were ligated to the pJRD215 vector previously digested with the same enzymes to give pCACC3 and pCC3Y73E, respectively. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α and subsequently transferred to D. desulfuricans G201 as described previously (21Voordouw G. Pollock W.B.R. Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. Rapp-Giles B.J. Wall J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172 (2nd Ed.): 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D. desulfuricans G201(pCACC3) and D. desulfuricans G201(pCC3Y73E) cells were obtained from 300-liter fermentations in Postgate C medium supplemented with 0.28 mm kanamycin. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 600 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA (pH 9) buffer, and stirred for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath. The mixture was then centrifuged (7700 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) and the resulting supernatant was dialyzed overnight against distilled water at 4 °C. This periplasmic fraction was centrifuged for 1 h at 140,000 × g and the supernatant was then loaded onto a column of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Elution with 400 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) yielded the cytochrome fraction containing both cytochromes from D. desulfuricans G201 and expressed cytochrome c 3 (M r 26,000) which were then applied to a hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with 400 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) containing fraction was eluted with 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). After overnight dialysis against distilled water, this fraction was absorbed on a DEAE-cellulose column and eluted using a gradient from 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl buffer (pH 7.6) to 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl buffer (pH 7.6). Pure wild-type or mutant cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) was obtained in the fraction eluting at 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.6). The purity of the samples was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PhastSystem, Pharmacia) and by amino acid analyses (Beckman amino acid analyzer system 6300). NH2 terminus sequence determinations were performed with an Applied Biosystem A470 gas-phase sequencer. Quantitative determination of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives was done by high pressure liquid chromatography (Waters) monitored by a data and chromatography control station (Waters Model 840). Determination of the individual oxidoreduction potentials of the heme groups of the wild-type and mutant cytochromes was performed as described previously (19Dolla A. Florens L. Bianco P. Haladjian J. Voordouw G. Forest E. Wall J. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6340-6346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isoelectric point of the protein was measured by isoelectric focusing using a PhastSystem apparatus from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Phast gel IEF 3–9, which operates in the 3–9 pH range, and morpholine polyacrylamide gel plates from Pharmacia (pH ranging from 3.5 to 9.5) were used together with a Pharmacia broad-range pI calibration kit. The [NiFeSe] hydrogenase was purified from D. desulfuricans Norway cells as described previously (26Reider R. Cammack R. Hall R.A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 245: 637-643Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interaction between periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from D. desulfuricans Norway and either wild-type or Y73E cytochromes was investigated with a biomolecular interaction analysis biosensor-based analytical system (BIAcore, Pharmacia). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Hydrogenase was immobilized on a Sensor chip CM5 (Pharmacia biosensor) through amine coupling. Hydrogenase was injected for 7 min (10 μl/min) resulting in approximately 3000 resonance units of immobilized protein. A continuous flow cell was equilibrated with HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20). Both cytochromes were diluted in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) and injected using a flow rate of 30 μl/min (150 μl). The complete amino acid sequence of cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) from D. desulfuricansNorway (23Bruschi M. Leroy G. Guerlesquin F. Bonicel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) enabled design of several degenerate oligonucleotides to clone its structural gene. Among these, probe 33–44D, corresponding to amino acid sequence 33 to 44 including the first heme-binding site, was the most suitable. Genomic DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes and blotted onto positively charged membrane. A 1.5-kbBamHI fragment which hybridized with the labeled 33–44D probe was selected for cloning. The same probe was used to screen recombinant plasmids for the presence of the gene. The screening of approximately 200 recombinant plasmids yielded one positive clone called pUCC19, a restriction map of which is shown in Fig.1. Further hybridization analyses and sequencing of this fragment revealed that the structural gene of cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000), namedcycD, was present in a 877-bpSalI-BamHI fragment. Its nucleotide sequence was obtained from both strands and translated into protein (Fig. 1). The mature cytochrome sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence 371 to 703, perfectly matches the amino acid sequence previously published (23Bruschi M. Leroy G. Guerlesquin F. Bonicel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A putative promoter (the −35 sequence TTGCCC at nucleotides 171 and the −10 sequence TATAAA at nucleotides 192) has been selected as the best fit to the E. coli ς70 consensus promoter sequences (27Mc Clure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). A possible ribosome-binding site (AGGAGG) is also present at nucleotide 291. A potential hairpin loop transcription termination signal, 8 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon, suggests that the cycD gene is not co-transcribed with other open reading frames. To confirm this hypothesis, a 1.5-kbEcoRV-SacI DNA fragment downstream from thecycD gene was cloned by hybridization with the oligonucleotide 48–55COMP, derived from nucleotides 513–532 (Fig. 1). Sequence analyses of this fragment revealed no open reading frames downstream from the cycD gene, further indicating thecycD gene is monocistronic. Moreover, Northern blot analyses revealed only one hybridization band when an intragenic cycDfragment was used as probe against total RNA isolated either fromD. desulfuricans Norway (Fig. 2, lane B) or from D. desulfuricans G201(pCACC3) (Fig. 2,lane A). No hybridization signal was visible when total RNA from D. desulfuricans G201(pJRD215) was probed in the same conditions (Fig. 2, lane C). The length of the specificcycD mRNA was determined to be about 550 bp, in complete agreement with the sequence data, confirming that the cycDgene is monocistronic.Figure 2Northern blot analysis of the total RNA isolated from D. desulfuricans G201(pCACC3) (lane A), D. desulfuricans Norway (lane B), andD. desulfuricans G201(pJRD215) (lane C).

Computer analysis predicts a signal peptide with a cleavage site between residues 24 and 25, which is in agreement with the NH2 terminus sequence of the mature protein. This signal sequence participates in the export of the cytochrome from the cytoplasm to the periplasm across the cytoplasmic membrane. Comparison of signal sequence of cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) with those of four other Desulfovibrio cytochromes whose genes have been cloned (31Voordouw G. Brenner S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Pollock W.B.R. Loutfi M. Bruschi M. Rapp-Giles B.J. Wall J.D. Voordouw G. J.

Bruschi M. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3575-3578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed no sequence homologies (not shown). However, they all exhibit typical features of a signal peptide with a positively charged NH2 terminus followed by a hydrophobic region. As attempts to express polyheme cytochromes in E. coli have been unsuccessful, the cycD gene in the broad-host range vector pJRD215 was introduced into another sulfate-reducing bacterium,D. desulfuricans G201, by transconjugation with E. coli. By expressing the plasmid-encoded cycD gene inD. desulfuricans G201(pCACC3), it was possible to purify about 90 mg of cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) per kg of wet cells, which is four times more than the amount obtained from the endogenous D. desulfuricans Norway chromosomal cycD gene. The cytochrome was purified from the periplasmic extract of D. desulfuricans G201(pCACC3). No mature cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, indicating that its signal effectively exports the molecule across the cytoplasmic membrane. The NH2 terminus sequence was identical to that of the protein purified from D. desulfuricans Norway, showing that the signal sequence was correctly cleaved in D. desulfuricansG201 during the transport of the protein to the periplasm (TableII).Table IICharacteristics of wild type and Y73E cytochromes c 3 (M r 26,000)D. desulfuricans Norway cytochrome c 3 (M r26,000)D. desulfuricans Norway cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) expressed inD. desulfuricans G201Y73E cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000)NH2terminus sequenceE-T-F-E-IE-T-F-E-IE-T-F-E-IIsoelectric point4.84.84.8Redox potentials (mV) (±10 mV)−220−215−175−285−280−220−325−320−260−370−365−335 Open table in a new tab The midpoint redox potentials of the four hemes were determined by electrochemistry; no significant differences were observed between the values measured in the case of the cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) expressed in D. desulfuricans G201 and that of the cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) isolated from D. desulfuricans Norway. In the same way, the isoelectric point of the molecules was the same (Table II) as were the molar extinction coefficients at 553 nm in the reduced state (data not shown). Therefore, cytochrome c 3(M r 26,000) overexpressed in D. desulfuricans G201 is indistinguishable from the molecule produced by D. desulfuricans Norway with regards to several biochemical and biophysical properties, suggesting that the folding of the two proteins is the same. The Y73E cytochrome c 3 (M r 26,000) was overexpressed and purified from the D. desulfuricansG201 (pCC3Y73E) cells as was done for the wild-type cytochrome. The NH2 terminus sequence of the Y73E cytochrome was identical to that of the wild-type molecule, indicating then that the mutant also was correctly cleaved during its export in the periplasm. Reconstructed mass spectra of Y73E cytochrome gave only one peak corresponding to the molecular mass of 14,950 (±2) Da for the subunit. This was consistent with the tyrosine/glutamate replacement and the insertion of four heme groups per subunit. No differences in the isoelectric point were noticed between the wild-type and Y73E cytochromesc 3, each exhibiting an acidic character (Table II). Both proteins (wild-type and mutant) were purified as dimers; the wild-type molecule is also isolated as a homodimer when it is purified from D. desulfuricans Norway. Thus, the Y73E mutation did not affect the dimerization process. The macroscopic oxidoreduction potentials, deduced from the simulation of the experimental"

The identification of multiple histone H1 subtypes in vertebrates suggests these proteins have specialized roles in chromatin organization and thus influence the regulation of gene expression in the multicellular organism. The mechanism by which the association of H1 with nucleosomal DNA is regulated is not completely understood, but affinity for different DNA sequences may play a role. Here we report that a specific H1 subtype in the mouse, namely H1b, selectively binds to a regulatory element within the protein-encoding sequence of a replication-dependent mouse H3.2 gene. We have previously shown that this coding region element, Ω, is the target of very specific interactions in vitro with another nuclear factor called the Ω factor. This element is required for normal gene expression in stably transfected rodent cells. The mouse H1b protein interacts poorly (100-fold lower affinity) with the comparable “Ω” sequence of a replication-independent mouse H3.3 gene. This H3.3 sequence differs at only 4 out of 22 nucleotide positions from the H3.2 sequence. Our findings raise the possibility that this H1b protein plays a specific role in regulation of expression of the replication-dependent histone gene family.

Five major classes of histones occur in the mouse and most eukaryotes, H1 and the core histones H2a, H2b, H3, and H4. These basic proteins play key roles in eukaryotic chromatin structure and organization. The core histones, H2a, H2b, H3, and H4, are responsible for nucleosome formation. H1 histones associate with “linker” DNA between adjacent nucleosomes and are thought to play a role in folding eukaryotic DNA into condensed higher order chromatin structures (1Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 2Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 3van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag KG, Berlin1989Crossref Google Scholar). It has long been known that H1 can act as a repressor of transcription; considerable evidence indicates that chromatin structure is important in the regulation of transcription because it restricts the accessibility to DNA of both general and gene-specific transcription factors (3van Holde K.E.

Linker histones are also known to modulate nucleosome position (9Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K.

There is evidence, however, that H1 is not completely absent from transcribed genes (14Mendelson E. Landsman D. Druckman S. Bustin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Ericsson C. Grossbach U. Bjorkroth B. Daneholt C.

The H1 class of histones displays the most complex pattern of subtypes among the histone gene family, including differentiation-specific and tissue-specific variant proteins.

Bradbury E.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggest that H1 subtypes also vary in their ability to confer repression throughout the genome. Both in vitro and in vivo studies of gene expression implicate the different H1 subtypes as part of a global regulatory process that is responsible for selectivity in repression of transcription (13Wolffe A.P.

Histone genes of all classes are highly conserved at the nucleotide level and are among the most highly expressed mammalian protein-encoding genes (23Zweidler A. Stein G.S. Stein J. Marzluff W.F. Histone Genes: Structure, Organization and Regulation. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1984: 339-371Google Scholar). H1 is the least conserved class of histone proteins. There are seven H1 protein sequence variants in the mouse. H4 is the most conserved of the histone classes; there are no sequence variants. Histone genes can be classified as replication-dependent or -independent (24Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Cell. 1981; 27: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 25Lennox R.W.

John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1984: 373-395Google Scholar) on the basis of their differential regulation of expression in the cell cycle. The expression of replication-dependent histone genes is tightly coupled with DNA synthesis in the eukaryotic cell. These genes are coordinately up-regulated at the G1-S boundary of the cell cycle, but the exact molecular mechanisms responsible remain to be elucidated (26Osley M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 27Heintz N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We previously identified a coding region activating sequence (CRAS) 1The abbreviations used are: CRAS, coding region activating sequence; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reverse phase HPLC. in mouse H2a.2 and H3.2 replication-dependent histone genes that is involved in the up-regulation of these and possibly all replication-dependent histone genes (28Hurt M.M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2929-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we identified two elements within the H3.2 CRAS, the α and Ω elements, that interact with nuclear proteins in vitro and are required for normal gene expression in vivo in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (30Bowman T.L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutation of the 7 base pairs of either the α or the Ω element caused a 4-fold drop in expression in vivo. Mouse nuclear factors, the α and Ω, have been shown to interact very specifically with these H3.2 elements. Mutations that change the α or Ω element to the sequence found in a replication-independent H3.3 gene totally abolish DNA-protein interactions and reproduce the effects on gene expression in vivo caused by mutation of all seven nucleotides of the α or Ω element. Although the DNA-binding protein interacting with the Ω element has not been purified, we have shown by UV cross-linking that it has an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa (31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and must be phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue to be active in a DNA-binding assay (32Kaludov N.K. Bowman T.L. Hurt M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The α and Ω elements are present in the coding region of all four nucleosomal (H2a, H2b, H3, and H4) classes of replication-dependent mouse histone genes, and the interactions of these elements with their respective nuclear factors are very similar if not identical (30Bowman T.L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M.

To date, no common elements, other than the CRAS α and Ω elements (30Bowman T.L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have been reported to be involved in regulating the coordinate expression of replication-dependent histone genes of all core histone classes. Here we report that a second nuclear factor, a specific mouse H1 subtype, H1b, also interacts with the H3.2 CRAS Ω element in a highly specific manner. There have been reports that total H1 shows preferred DNA binding toward AT-rich tracts because of the intrinsic properties associated with A-rich sequences (34Zlatanova J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 273-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Zlatanova J. Yaneva J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1991; 15: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

A. 1995; 92: 7060-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that DNA curvature in itself is not enough to promote strong H1 binding and that there are additional sequence requirements for high affinity H1 binding sites. Others have reported that H1 histones prefer some non-AT-rich eukaryotic sequences over others (37Kandolf H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7257-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38Berent S.L. Sevall J.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2977-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39Ristiniemi J. Oikarinen J.

All of these previous studies utilized total cellular H1. It should be remembered that, in asynchronously growing cells, a number of sequence variants may be present, disguising the preferential participation or nonparticipation in such interactions by specific H1 subtypes. Herein we show in in vitro experiments that the pure H1b protein interacts with 100-fold less affinity with the comparable sequence from a replication-independent H3.3 gene, differing at only 4 out of 22 nucleotides from the H3.2 sequence. The specificity of this interaction for sequences within the replication-dependent gene indicates that mouse H1b may play a distinct role in regulation of coordinate expression of histone genes in the eukaryotic cell cycle. Mouse myeloma cells were grown in spinner cultures to a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% horse serum, and 5% CO2, at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared by our modification of the method of Shapiro et al. (42Shapiro D. Sharp P.A. Wahli W. Keller M. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.75 mm spermine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl). The cells were incubated for 15 min on ice (or until swollen), and their membranes were disrupted with 13 strokes in a homogenizer. The nuclei were pelleted at 3,000 rpm and resuspended in nuclear resuspension buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 25% glycerol). KCl was added to a final concentration of 0.6 m, and the mixture was rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. Chromatin was pelleted at 40,000 rpm for 45 min in a fixed angle rotor. The supernatant was transferred to autoclaved dialysis tubing, and the nuclear extract was dialyzed against 100-fold dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 20% glycerol) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Nuclear extracts were applied to DNA-cellulose resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., 40-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT). Proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mm, 300 mm, 400 mm, and 1 m KCl. The collected fractions were analyzed for Ω-binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Southwestern analysis. Synthetic oligonucleotides used in EMSA competition experiments and Southwestern assays were synthesized with the mouse H3.2 CRAS Ω sequence (31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that of the H3.3 “CRAS Ω.” The oligonucleotide sequences areGTGCGCGAGATCGCGCAGGACT CGCTCTAGCGCGTCCTGAcacgSEQUENCE 1for the H3.2 CRAS Ω box duplex and****GTGCGAGAAATTGCTCAGGACT CTCTTTAACGAGTCCTGAcacgSEQUENCE 2for the H3.3 CRAS Ω box duplex. Lowercase letters at the 3′ end of the duplex indicate nucleotides synthesized as complementary overhangs. The nucleotides in the 5′ overhang are part of the nucleotide sequence of both genes. Asterisks indicate changed nucleotide positions in the H3.3 Ω sequence. The sequences used for synthesis of the H3.3 oligonucleotides were obtained from published mouse H3.3 sequences (43Wellman S.E. Casano P. Pilch D. Marzluff W.F. Sittman D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 59: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Krimer D. Cheng G. Skoultchi A.I.

The duplex oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP by means of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (29Hurt M.M. Bowman T.L. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell.

The binding reactions proceeded at 4 °C for 20 min in the presence of 1 μg of the nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) and then were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% native acrylamide gel at 200 V (46Gilman M. Wilson R. Weinberg R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified directly by analysis of the intact gel with a Betascope (Betagen). Footprinting of the H1b-CRAS Ω complex was performed by the DNase I footprinting procedure previously described (31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M.

The annealed duplex was incubated with mouse nuclear extract, with subsequent addition of H1b, duplicating conditions used in EMSA (see Fig. 1), and then treated with DNase I (31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Free and bound complexes were then separated by EMSA. The supershifted H1b-Ω-DNA complexes were sliced from the gel and eluted at 37 °C overnight and then analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8m urea sequencing gel.Figure 1The CRAS Ω factor elutes in the 0.3m fraction from DNA-cellulose. Mouse myeloma cell nuclear extract was applied to a DNA-cellulose column, and fractions were eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EMSA of fractions is as follows. Lane 1, crude nuclear extract (column load); lane 2, flow-through (F.T.) of the DNA-cellulose column; lanes 3–7, pooled 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 1 m KCl DNA-cellulose fractions. All reactions contained the same amount of protein (6 μg) and radioactively labeled duplex H3.2 CRAS Ω oligonucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Southwestern blotting of SDS gels containing proteins from the DNA-cellulose and reversed-phase HPLC fractions was performed as described by Lenormand et al.(47Lenormand J.-L. Guillier M. Leibovitch S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) except that the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT (TNE-50) containing 2 × 106 cpm/ml end-labeled duplex Ω oligonucleotides and the nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (50 μg/ml). Membranes were then washed with excess TNE-50, and radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. The 1 m KCl DNA-cellulose column fraction was subsequently further fractionated by reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC on a Brownlee Aquapore RP-300 analytical column (Rainin Instruments, MA) with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phases A and B, respectively. The column was developed with a linear increase in acetonitrile concentration from 25 to 45% at 0.3%/min, with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. Column eluate was monitored at 214 nm, and fractions were collected by hand, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. The HPLC system included Beckman System Gold software, run on an IBM PS/2, the Beckman 126 solvent delivery system, an Altex 210A sample injection valve, and a Waters 441 absorbance detector. Proteins in the DNA-cellulose 1 m fraction and RP-HPLC fractions were further examined by acid-urea gel electrophoresis. The extraction of total H1 from mouse myeloma cells utilized the method of R. D. Cole (48Cole R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Acid-urea gel electrophoresis followed the method of Lennox and Cohen (49Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Glass plate dimensions used were 26 × 25 × 0.5 cm. The gels were conditioned as described previously (49Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After samples were loaded, the proteins were separated at 250 V for 12 h. Gels were stained with Amido Black, destained, and then silver-stained (Bio-Rad). Reversed-phase purified fractions were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C with 1–2% (w/w) V8 protease. Peptides were separated by RP-HPLC on a Deltabond® Octyl analytical column (Keystone Scientific) with a linear acetonitrile gradient from 0 to 50% at 0.5%/min. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and fractions were collected manually and dried for automated protein sequenation. Amino acid composition data were obtained by the Pico-Tag® method (Waters Chromatography Division, MA). Briefly, dried protein samples were subjected to vapor phase hydrolysis with 6 n HCl in a MDS-200 microwave sample preparation system (CEM Corp.). Hydrolyzed samples were derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate according to standard methods and run on a Waters HPLC system controlled by a Maxima 820 Workstation for data acquisition and analysis. Amino acids were quantitated by comparison with Amino Acid Standard H (Pierce). We utilized DNA-cellulose chromatography as the first step in the purification of the CRAS Ω-binding factor(s) from crude mouse myeloma cell nuclear extract. Fig. 1shows a gel mobility shift assay of the DNA-cellulose fractions, using as probe radioactively labeled Ω oligonucleotides that contain the CRAS Ω-binding site CGAGATC (31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Ω-binding activity eluted in the 0.3 m fraction (lane 5). We have previously shown that the binding activity eluting in the 0.3 mfraction protects the Ω sequence in a DNase I footprinting assay and that the H3.2 Ω duplex oligonucleotides, but not the H3.3 Ω duplex oligonucleotides, act as specific competitors for the Ω-binding activity. We further examined the DNA-cellulose fractions by Southwestern analysis. The results are shown in Fig. 2 A. Radioactively labeled duplex H3.2 Ω oligonucleotides or, alternatively, the corresponding sequence from a replication-independent H3.3 gene that we have shown cannot act as a binding site for the CRAS Ω factor (31Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Hurt M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used as probes. The two oligonucleotide sequences are compared in panel C. Before hybridization with radioactive probe, the proteins in the column fractions were separated on SDS gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inlane 1 of Fig. 2 A, an intense signal is observed as a result of an interaction between the H3.2 probe and a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa in the crude nuclear extract. The 0.3 m fraction showed no evidence of protein interaction with the H3.2 oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), although as shown above, this fraction contained the specific Ω-binding activity observed in EMSA (Fig. 1, lane 5). In Fig. 2 A, the DNA-protein interaction observed in crude extract (lane 1) was also observed in lane 4, showing that the interacting protein (apparent molecular mass, 30 kDa) was contained in the 1 m DNA-cellulose fraction. This interaction was not detected when the H3.3 Ω oligonucleotides were used as probe (lanes 5 and 8). Direct quantitation of the radioactivity bound to the membranes showed that the H3.3 oligonucleotides did interact to some extent with the protein producing the strong signal seen in lanes 1 and4, but the amount of bound probe was over 100-fold less than that bound in the comparable lanes when the H3.2 oligonucleotides were used. The H3.2 and H3.3 oligonucleotide sequences differ at only four nucleotide positions, three of which are in the Ω element (see Fig.2 C). The highly specific nature of the interaction between the protein(s) in the 1 m fraction and the H3.2 Ω sequence was confirmed in a separate southwestern competition experiment, shown in Fig.2 B. Unlabeled duplex H3.2 Ω oligonucleotides competed very efficiently with the radioactive H3.2 probe, eliminating the interaction when in 100-fold excess (lane 3). Conversely, the H3.3 Ω competitor duplex did not compete with the H3.2 probe (lanes 4 and 5) even when present in 100-fold molar excess. Because the two oligonucleotide duplexes differ at only 4 nucleotide positions (Fig. 2 C), these results show that the DNA-protein interactions detected in the Southwestern analysis are highly specific for the H3.2 CRAS Ω sequence. Further purification of the proteins in the 1m fraction was achieved by RP-HPLC. The RP-HPLC profile of the 1 m fraction is presented in Fig.3 A as peaks of absorbance at 214 nm. Subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the collected fractions A, B, and C is shown in Fig. 3 B,lanes 1–3. Silver staining of the SDS gel revealed that fractions A–C contain proteins with apparent molecular masses of about 30–35 kDa, whereas lane 4 (1 m fraction) contained multiple proteins of much higher molecular mass (data not shown). A repeat of the Southwestern assay in Fig. 2 using the H3.2 and H3.3 Ω oligonucleotides as probes with the RP-HPLC fraction A is shown in Fig. 3 C. The protein(s) contained in fraction A showed the same interaction with the H3.2 Ω sequence as seen in Fig. 2, indicated by the intense radioactive band observed in lane 1. As was true for the proteins in the 1 mDNA-cellulose fraction (Fig. 2 A, lane 8), the protein(s) in RP-HPLC fraction A showed 100-fold less affinity for the H3.3 Ω sequence (lane 2). The strong affinity of mouse nuclear proteins contained in the 1m DNA-cellulose fraction for DNA (elution with 1m salt) and their rapid mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that these proteins might be histones. Although SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis theoretically separates proteins according to their molecular weight, histones behave anomalously in such gels because of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (25Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Stein G.S. Stein J. Marzluff W.F. Histone Genes: Structure, Organization, and Regulation. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1984: 373-395Google Scholar). Acid-urea gels have been used successfully to separate histones on the basis of differences in net charge and mass (50Panyim S. Chalkey R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). This method accomplishes the separation of modified and unmodified forms of the basic histone proteins and allows for the partial separation of the various H1 subtypes as well as their differentially phosphorylated forms (51Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, only highly basic proteins (like histones) enter these gels. In Fig. 4, acid-urea gel analysis of column fractions is shown. Total H1 prepared from mouse chromatin is shown in lane 1. The 1 mDNA-cellulose fraction was loaded in lane 2. The proteins observed in this lane migrate identically to those observed inlane 1 (total H1). Acid gel separation of proteins in RP-HPLC fraction A is shown in lane 3. The subset of bands seen in this lane is also observed in lane 1 (total H1). The results shown in Fig. 4 are consistent with the hypothesis that protein(s) in the 1 m fraction that interact preferentially with the H3.2 Ω sequence are H1 histones. To identify conclusively the proteins interacting in such a highly specific manner with the H3.2 Ω sequence, we digested the protein contained in RP-HPLC fraction A with Staphylococcus aureusV8 protease. The resulting peptides were fractionated by RP-HPLC and analyzed by automated protein sequenation. Fig.5 A shows the RP-HPLC elution profile of these peptides. Retention times are recorded above thepeaks, and the sequenced fragments are numbered at thebases of their"

https://openalex.org/W2018911668,"We readily produced recombinant pro-macrophage stimulating protein in a mammalian expression system, but it was only weakly active after proteolytic activation. Active macrophage stimulating protein is a disulfide-bonded heterodimer, but in our hands, the subunits of recombinant macrophage stimulating protein were mostly not disulfide bonded. Molecular modeling of the serine proteinase domain of macrophage stimulating protein based on homology to human trypsin suggested that macrophage stimulating protein, but not plasminogen or hepatocyte growth factor, has a Cys residue (672) in close proximity to the Cys residue (578) that forms the intersubunit disulfide link with the other subunit. We hypothesized that Cys672 might interfere with intersubunit disulfide formation by forming an intrasubunit disulfide with Cys578 and therefore mutated Cys672 to Ala. After kallikrein activation, the subunits of Cys672 → Ala macrophage stimulating protein were fully disulfide linked, and the mutant macrophage stimulating protein had 10–20-fold higher specific activity than the wild type recombinant macrophage stimulating protein."
