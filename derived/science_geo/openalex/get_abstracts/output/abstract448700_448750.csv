https://openalex.org/W2012056552,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) primarily reside in the bone marrow where signals generated by stromal cells regulate their self-renewal, proliferation and trafficking. Endosteal osteoblasts and perivascular stromal cells including endothelial cells, CXCL12-abundant reticular cells, leptin-receptor-positive stromal cells, and nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive mesenchymal progenitors have all been implicated in HSC maintenance. However, it is unclear whether specific haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) subsets reside in distinct niches defined by the surrounding stromal cells and the regulatory molecules they produce. CXCL12 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12) regulates both HSCs and lymphoid progenitors and is expressed by all of these stromal cell populations. Here we selectively deleted Cxcl12 from candidate niche stromal cell populations and characterized the effect on HPCs. Deletion of Cxcl12 from mineralizing osteoblasts has no effect on HSCs or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osterix-expressing stromal cells, which include CXCL12-abundant reticular cells and osteoblasts, results in constitutive HPC mobilization and a loss of B-lymphoid progenitors, but HSC function is normal. Cxcl12 deletion from endothelial cells results in a modest loss of long-term repopulating activity. Strikingly, deletion of Cxcl12 from nestin-negative mesenchymal progenitors using Prx1-cre (Prx1 also known as Prrx1) is associated with a marked loss of HSCs, long-term repopulating activity, HSC quiescence and common lymphoid progenitors. These data suggest that osterix-expressing stromal cells comprise a distinct niche that supports B-lymphoid progenitors and retains HPCs in the bone marrow, and that expression of CXCL12 from stromal cells in the perivascular region, including endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors, supports HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2005718040,"Although haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are commonly assumed to reside within a specialized microenvironment, or niche, most published experimental manipulations of the HSC niche have affected the function of diverse restricted progenitors. This raises the fundamental question of whether HSCs and restricted progenitors reside within distinct, specialized niches or whether they share a common niche. Here we assess the physiological sources of the chemokine CXCL12 for HSC and restricted progenitor maintenance. Cxcl12(DsRed) knock-in mice (DsRed-Express2 recombined into the Cxcl12 locus) showed that Cxcl12 was primarily expressed by perivascular stromal cells and, at lower levels, by endothelial cells, osteoblasts and some haematopoietic cells. Conditional deletion of Cxcl12 from haematopoietic cells or nestin-cre-expressing cells had little or no effect on HSCs or restricted progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from endothelial cells depleted HSCs but not myeloerythroid or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from perivascular stromal cells depleted HSCs and certain restricted progenitors and mobilized these cells into circulation. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osteoblasts depleted certain early lymphoid progenitors but not HSCs or myeloerythroid progenitors, and did not mobilize these cells into circulation. Different stem and progenitor cells thus reside in distinct cellular niches in bone marrow: HSCs occupy a perivascular niche and early lymphoid progenitors occupy an endosteal niche."
https://openalex.org/W2099326239,"Lampreys are representatives of an ancient vertebrate lineage that diverged from our own ∼500 million years ago. By virtue of this deeply shared ancestry, the sea lamprey (P. marinus) genome is uniquely poised to provide insight into the ancestry of vertebrate genomes and the underlying principles of vertebrate biology. Here, we present the first lamprey whole-genome sequence and assembly. We note challenges faced owing to its high content of repetitive elements and GC bases, as well as the absence of broad-scale sequence information from closely related species. Analyses of the assembly indicate that two whole-genome duplications likely occurred before the divergence of ancestral lamprey and gnathostome lineages. Moreover, the results help define key evolutionary events within vertebrate lineages, including the origin of myelin-associated proteins and the development of appendages. The lamprey genome provides an important resource for reconstructing vertebrate origins and the evolutionary events that have shaped the genomes of extant organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2047683706,"Adipocytes have been suggested to arise from prospective progenitors of endothelial or haematopoietic origin. Rödeheffer and colleagues use lineage tracing to rule out that this is the case for white adipocytes, and show that they instead arise from CD24+ cells that are characterized by the expression of PdgfR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). Mature adipocytes are generated through the proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells. Our previous studies identified adipocyte progenitors in white adipose tissue (WAT) as Lin−:CD29+:CD34+:Sca-1+:CD24+ (CD24+) cells that are capable of generating functional WAT (ref. 1). Here, we employ several Cre recombinase mouse models to identify the adipocyte cellular lineage in vivo. Although it has been proposed that white adipocytes are derived from endothelial2 and haematopoietic3,4 lineages, we find that neither of these lineages label white adipocytes. However, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PdgfR α)–Cre trace labels all white adipocytes. Analysis of WAT from PdgfR α–Cre reporter mice identifies CD24+ and Lin−:CD29+:CD34+:Sca-1+: CD24− (CD24−) cells as adipocyte precursors. We show that CD24+ cells generate the CD24− population in vivo and the CD24− cells express late markers of adipogenesis. From these data we propose a model where the CD24+ adipocyte progenitors become further committed to the adipocyte lineage as CD24 expression is lost, generating CD24− preadipocytes. This characterization of the adipocyte cellular lineage will facilitate the study of the mechanisms that regulate WAT formation in vivo and WAT mass expansion in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2026299543,"Bamboo represents the only major lineage of grasses that is native to forests and is one of the most important non-timber forest products in the world. However, no species in the Bambusoideae subfamily has been sequenced. Here, we report a high-quality draft genome sequence of moso bamboo (P. heterocycla var. pubescens). The 2.05-Gb assembly covers 95% of the genomic region. Gene prediction modeling identified 31,987 genes, most of which are supported by cDNA and deep RNA sequencing data. Analyses of clustered gene families and gene collinearity show that bamboo underwent whole-genome duplication 7-12 million years ago. Identification of gene families that are key in cell wall biosynthesis suggests that the whole-genome duplication event generated more gene duplicates involved in bamboo shoot development. RNA sequencing analysis of bamboo flowering tissues suggests a potential connection between drought-responsive and flowering genes."

https://openalex.org/W2031263088,"A key issue in cancer biology is whether oncogenic transformation of different cell types of origin within an adult tissue gives rise to distinct tumour subtypes that differ in their prognosis and/or treatment response. We now show that initiation of prostate tumours in basal or luminal epithelial cells in mouse models results in tumours with distinct molecular signatures that are predictive of human patient outcomes. Furthermore, our analysis of untransformed basal cells reveals an unexpected assay dependence of their stem cell properties in sphere formation and transplantation assays versus genetic lineage tracing during prostate regeneration and adult tissue homeostasis. Although oncogenic transformation of basal cells gives rise to tumours with luminal phenotypes, cross-species bioinformatic analyses indicate that tumours of luminal origin are more aggressive than tumours of basal origin, and identify a molecular signature associated with patient outcome. Our results reveal the inherent plasticity of basal cells, and support a model in which different cells of origin generate distinct molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. Shen and colleagues find that initiation of prostate tumours by basal or luminal epithelial cells in mice leads to distinct tumour signatures. Interestingly, they find that although oncogenic transformation of basal cells gives rise to tumours with luminal phenotypes, tumours of luminal origins are more aggressive in functional tests and the distinct signature correlated with that of patients with aggressive tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2167845320,"Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are heterodimeric transcription factors induced in many cancers where they frequently promote the expression of protumorigenic pathways. Though transcription factors are typically considered 'undruggable', the PAS-B domain of the HIF-2α subunit contains a large cavity within its hydrophobic core that offers a unique foothold for small-molecule regulation. Here we identify artificial ligands that bind within this pocket and characterize the resulting structural and functional changes caused by binding. Notably, these ligands antagonize HIF-2 heterodimerization and DNA-binding activity in vitro and in cultured cells, reducing HIF-2 target gene expression. Despite the high sequence identity between HIF-2α and HIF-1α, these ligands are highly selective and do not affect HIF-1 function. These chemical tools establish the molecular basis for selective regulation of HIF-2, providing potential therapeutic opportunities to intervene in HIF-2-driven tumors, such as renal cell carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2017282333,"Sensory signals are transduced at high resolution, but their structure must be stored in a more compact format. Here we provide evidence that the auditory system summarizes the temporal details of sounds using time-averaged statistics. We measured discrimination of 'sound textures' that were characterized by particular statistical properties, as normally result from the superposition of many acoustic features in auditory scenes. When listeners discriminated examples of different textures, performance improved with excerpt duration. In contrast, when listeners discriminated different examples of the same texture, performance declined with duration, a paradoxical result given that the information available for discrimination grows with duration. These results indicate that once these sounds are of moderate length, the brain's representation is limited to time-averaged statistics, which, for different examples of the same texture, converge to the same values with increasing duration. Such statistical representations produce good categorical discrimination, but limit the ability to discern temporal detail."
https://openalex.org/W2119188591,"Despite empirical support for an increase in ecosystem productivity with species diversity in synthetic systems, there is ample evidence that this relationship is dependent on environmental characteristics, especially in structurally more complex natural systems. Empirical support for this relationship in forests is urgently needed, as these ecosystems play an important role in carbon sequestration.We tested whether tree wood production is positively related to tree species richness while controlling for climatic factors, by analyzing 55265 forest inventory plots in 11 forest types across five European countries. On average, wood production was 24% higher in mixed than in monospecific forests. Taken alone, wood production was enhanced with increasing tree species richness in almost all forest types. In some forests, wood production was also greater with increasing numbers of tree types. Structural Equation Modeling indicated that the increase in wood production with tree species richness was largely mediated by a positive association between stand basal area and tree species richness. Mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation affected wood production and species richness directly. However, the direction and magnitude of the influence of climatic variables on wood production and species richness was not consistent, and vary dependent on forest type.Our analysis is the first to find a local scale positive relationship between tree species richness and tree wood production occurring across a continent. Our results strongly support incorporating the role of biodiversity in management and policy plans for forest carbon sequestration."
https://openalex.org/W2070536046,"Neurons within the CA3 region of the hippocampus are relatively resistant to cell death after ischemia. Alastair M. Buchan and his colleagues demonstrate that the product of the TSC1 gene, hamartin, is upregulated in CA3 neurons in response to ischemia. Hamartin promotes survival by inhibiting mTORC1 and increasing autophagic flux in neurons. Previous attempts to identify neuroprotective targets by studying the ischemic cascade and devising ways to suppress it have failed to translate to efficacious therapies for acute ischemic stroke1. We hypothesized that studying the molecular determinants of endogenous neuroprotection in two well-established paradigms, the resistance of CA3 hippocampal neurons to global ischemia2 and the tolerance conferred by ischemic preconditioning (IPC)3, would reveal new neuroprotective targets. We found that the product of the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 gene (TSC1), hamartin, is selectively induced by ischemia in hippocampal CA3 neurons. In CA1 neurons, hamartin was unaffected by ischemia but was upregulated by IPC preceding ischemia, which protects the otherwise vulnerable CA1 cells. Suppression of hamartin expression with TSC1 shRNA viral vectors both in vitro and in vivo increased the vulnerability of neurons to cell death following oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and ischemia. In vivo, suppression of TSC1 expression increased locomotor activity and decreased habituation in a hippocampal-dependent task. Overexpression of hamartin increased resistance to OGD by inducing productive autophagy through an mTORC1-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1969336096,"Delayed T cell recovery and restricted T cell receptor (TCR) diversity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are associated with increased risks of infection and cancer relapse. Technical challenges have limited faithful measurement of TCR diversity after allo-HSCT. Here we combined 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends PCR with deep sequencing to quantify TCR diversity in 28 recipients of allo-HSCT using a single oligonucleotide pair. Analysis of duplicate blood samples confirmed that we accurately determined the frequency of individual TCRs. After 6 months, cord blood-graft recipients approximated the TCR diversity of healthy individuals, whereas recipients of T cell-depleted peripheral-blood stem cell grafts had 28-fold and 14-fold lower CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell diversities, respectively. After 12 months, these deficiencies had improved for the CD4(+) but not the CD8(+) T cell compartment. Overall, this method provides unprecedented views of T cell repertoire recovery after allo-HSCT and may identify patients at high risk of infection or relapse."
https://openalex.org/W1996916774,"Coordinating the balance between haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and self-renewal is crucial for maintaining haematopoiesis lifelong. Equally important for haematopoietic function is modulating HSC localization within the bone marrow niches, as maintenance of HSC function is tightly controlled by a complex network of intrinsic molecular mechanisms and extrinsic signalling interactions with their surrounding microenvironment. In this study we demonstrate that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nfe2l2, or Nrf2), well established as a global regulator of the oxidative stress response, plays a regulatory role in several aspects of HSC homeostasis. Nrf2 deficiency results in an expansion of the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment due to cell-intrinsic hyperproliferation, which was accomplished at the expense of HSC quiescence and self-renewal. We further show that Nrf2 modulates both migration and retention of HSCs in their niche. Moreover, we identify a previously unrecognized link between Nrf2 and CXCR4, contributing, at least partially, to the maintenance of HSC function."

https://openalex.org/W2063213431,"The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a prerequisite for cancer progression and metastasis formation, is regulated not only at the transcriptional but also at the post-transcriptional level, including at the level of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Several recent studies have highlighted the involvement of splicing factors, including epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (Esrps) and RNA-binding Fox protein 2 (Rbfox2), in this process. Esrps regulate epithelial-specific splicing, and their expression is downregulated during EMT. By contrast, the role of Rbfox2 is controversial because Rbfox2 regulates epithelial as well as mesenchymal splicing events. Here, we have used several established cell culture models to investigate the functions of Rbfox2 during EMT. We demonstrate that induction of an EMT upregulates the expression of Rbfox2, which correlates with an increase in Rbfox2-regulated splicing events in the cortactin (Cttn), Pard3 and dynamin 2 (Dnm2) transcripts. At the same time, however, the epithelial-specific ability to splice the Enah, Slk and Tsc2 transcripts is either reduced or lost completely by Rbfox2, which might be due, in part, to downregulation of the expression of the Esrps cooperative factors. Depletion of Rbfox2 during EMT did not prevent the activation of transforming growth factor-β signaling, the upregulation of mesenchymal markers or changes in cell morphology toward a mesenchymal phenotype. In addition, this depletion did not influence cell migration. However, depletion of Rbfox2 in cells that have completed an EMT significantly reduced their invasive potential. Taken together, our results suggest that during an EMT, Rbfox2-regulated splicing shifts from epithelial-to mesenchymal-specific events, leading to a higher degree of tissue invasiveness."

https://openalex.org/W1972130232,"MicroRNAs are involved in regulating the biology of cancer cells, but their involvement in chemoresistance is not fully understood. We found that miR-663 was up-regulated in our induced multidrug-resistant MDA-MB-231/ADM cell line and that this up-regulation was closely related to chemosensitivity. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role of miR-663 in regulating the chemoresistance of breast cancer. MicroRNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR assays were used to identify differentially expressed microRNAs. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V/propidium iodide staining, TUNEL, and reactive oxygen species generation analysis. The expression of miR-663 and HSPG2 in breast cancer tissues was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The potential targets of miR-663 were defined by a luciferase reporter assay. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to analyze the methylation status. We found that miR-663 was significantly elevated in MDA-MB-231/ADM cells, and the down-regulation of miR-663 sensitized MDA-MB-231/ADM cells to both cyclophosphamide and docetaxel. The overexpression of miR-663 in breast tumor tissues was associated with chemoresistance; in MDA-MB-231 cells, this chemoresistance was accompanied by the down-regulation of HSPG2, which was identified as a target of miR-663. MDA-MB-231/ADM contained fewer methylated CpG sites than its parental cell line, and miR-663 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was reactivated by 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine treatment, indicating that DNA methylation may play a functional role in the expression of miR-663. Our findings suggest that the overexpression of hypomethylated miR-663 induced chemoresistance in breast cancer cells by down-regulating HSPG2, thus providing a potential target for the development of an microRNA-based approach for breast cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1982298098,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 17-β-estradiol (E2)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the induction of mammary tumorigenesis. We found that ROS-induced by repeated exposures to 4-hydroxy-estradiol (4-OH-E2), a predominant catechol metabolite of E2, caused transformation of normal human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells with malignant growth in nude mice. This was evident from inhibition of estrogen-induced breast tumor formation in the xenograft model by both overexpression of catalase as well as by co-treatment with Ebselen. To understand how 4-OH-E2 induces this malignant phenotype through ROS, we investigated the effects of 4-OH-E2 on redox-sensitive signal transduction pathways. During the malignant transformation process we observed that 4-OH-E2 treatment increased AKT phosphorylation through PI3K activation. The PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of AKT in 4-OH-E2-treated cells was inhibited by ROS modifiers as well as by silencing of AKT expression. RNA interference of AKT markedly inhibited 4-OH-E2-induced in vitro tumor formation. The expression of cell cycle genes, cdc2, PRC1 and PCNA and one of transcription factors that control the expression of these genes – nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) was significantly up-regulated during the 4-OH-E2-mediated malignant transformation process. The increased expression of these genes was inhibited by ROS modifiers as well as by silencing of AKT expression. These results indicate that 4-OH-E2-induced cell transformation may be mediated, in part, through redox-sensitive AKT signal transduction pathways by up-regulating the expression of cell cycle genes cdc2, PRC1 and PCNA, and the transcription factor – NRF-1. In summary, our study has demonstrated that: (i) 4-OH-E2 is one of the main estrogen metabolites that induce mammary tumorigenesis and (ii) ROS-mediated signaling leading to the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway plays an important role in the generation of 4-OH-E2-induced malignant phenotype of breast epithelial cells. In conclusion, ROS are important signaling molecules in the development of estrogen-induced malignant breast lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2033407338,"Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are the most frequent soft-tissue sarcoma in children and characteristically show features of developing skeletal muscle. The alveolar subtype is frequently associated with a PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein that is known to contribute to the undifferentiated myogenic phenotype of RMS cells. Histone methylation of lysine residues controls developmental processes in both normal and malignant cell contexts. Here we show that JARID2, which encodes a protein known to recruit various complexes with histone-methylating activity to their target genes, is significantly overexpressed in RMS with PAX3-FOXO1 compared with the fusion gene-negative RMS (t-test; P<0.0001). Multivariate analyses showed that higher JARID2 levels are also associated with metastases at diagnosis, independent of fusion gene status and RMS subtype (n=120; P=0.039). JARID2 levels were altered by silencing or overexpressing PAX3-FOXO1 in RMS cell lines with and without the fusion gene, respectively. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that JARID2 is a direct transcriptional target of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein. Silencing JARID2 resulted in reduced cell proliferation coupled with myogenic differentiation, including increased expression of Myogenin (MYOG) and Myosin Light Chain (MYL1) in RMS cell lines representative of both the alveolar and embryonal subtypes. Induced myogenic differentiation was associated with a decrease in JARID2 levels and this phenotype could be rescued by overexpressing JARID2. Furthermore, we that showed JARID2 binds to and alters the methylation status of histone H3 lysine 27 in the promoter regions of MYOG and MYL1 and that the interaction of JARID2 at these promoters is dependent on EED, a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Therefore, JARID2 is a downstream effector of PAX3-FOXO1 that maintains an undifferentiated myogenic phenotype that is characteristic of RMS. JARID2 and other components of PRC2 may represent novel therapeutic targets for treating RMS patients."
https://openalex.org/W1969201755,"Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) results in potent cytotoxicity of a variety of cancer cell types, and these drugs are used clinically to treat hematological tumors. They are known to repress the transcription of ERBB2 and many other oncogenes, but little is known about this mechanism. Using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to measure nascent transcription, we find that HDACI cause transcriptional repression by blocking RNA polymerase II elongation. Our data show that HDACI preferentially repress the transcription of highly expressed genes as well as high copy number genes in HER2+ breast cancer genomes. In contrast, genes that are activated by HDACI are moderately expressed. We analyzed gene copy number in combination with microarray and GRO-seq analysis of expression level, in normal and breast cancer cells to show that high copy number genes are more likely to be repressed by HDACI than non-amplified genes. The inhibition of transcription of amplified oncogenes, which promote survival and proliferation of cancer cells, might explain the cancer-specific lethality of HDACI, and may represent a general therapeutic strategy for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1988837044,"The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a master regulator of developmental cell-fate decisions, although the key target pathways are poorly characterized. Here, we interrogated the contribution of the SWI/SNF subunit and tumor suppressor SNF5 to the regulation of developmental pathways using conditional mouse and cell culture models. We find that loss of SNF5 phenocopies β-catenin hyperactivation and that SNF5 is essential for regulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway target expression. These data provide insight into chromatin-based mechanisms that underlie developmental regulation and elucidate the emerging theme that mutation of this tumor suppressor complex can activate developmental pathways by uncoupling them from upstream control."
https://openalex.org/W2051712052,"IGFBP-2 is highly expressed in both the serum and tumor tissues of most cancers, and is considered one of the most significant genes in the signature of major cancers. IGFBP-2 mainly modulates IGF actions in the pericellular space; however, there is considerable evidence to suggest that IGFBP-2 may also act independently of the IGFs. These IGF-independent actions of IGFBP-2 are exerted either via interactions at the cell surface or intracellularly, via interaction with cytoplasmic or nuclear-binding partners. The precise mechanism underlying the intracellular/intranuclear localization of IGFBP-2 remains unclear. In this study, we investigated IGFBP-2 nuclear localization in several common cancer cells with the aim of dissecting the mechanism of its nuclear trafficking. IGFBP-2 is detected in the nuclei of common cancer cells, including breast, prostate and several neuroblastoma cell lines, using cell fractionation and confocal microscopy. Via nuclear import assays, we show that nuclear entry of IGFBP-2 is mediated by the classical nuclear import mechanisms, primarily through importin-α, as demonstrated by the use of blocking, competition and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Bioinformatics analysis of the IGFBP-2 protein sequence with PSORT II identified a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) sequence at 179PKKLRPP185, within the IGFBP-2 linker domain, mutagenesis of which abolishes IGFBP-2 nuclear import. Accordingly, the NLSmutIGFBP-2 fails to activate the VEGF promoter, which would otherwise occur in the presence of wild-type IGFBP-2. As a consequence, no activation of angiogenic processes were observed in NLSmutIGFBP-2 expressing SHEP cells when implanted onto our in vivo quail chorio-allantoic membrane model. Taken together, these data show for the first time that IGFBP-2 possesses a functional NLS sequence and that IGFBP-2 actively translocates into the nucleus by a classical nuclear import mechanism, involving formation of IGFBP-2 complexes with importin-α. Nuclear IGFBP-2 is required for the activation of VEGF expression and consequent angiogenesis."

We mapped the locations of 70 scaffolds spanning 4 million base pairs of the human genome's unplaced euchromatic sequence, including more than a dozen protein-coding genes, and identified 8 new large interchromosomal segmental duplications. We find that most of these sequences are hidden in the genome's heterochromatin, particularly its pericentromeric regions. Many cryptic, pericentromeric genes are expressed at the RNA level and have been maintained intact for millions of years while their expression patterns diverged from those of paralogous genes elsewhere in the genome. We describe how knowledge of the locations of these sequences can inform disease association and genome biology studies."
https://openalex.org/W2036158954,"Metastatic melanoma remains a devastating disease with a 5-year survival rate of less than five percent. Despite recent advances in targeted therapies for melanoma, only a small percentage of melanoma patients experience durable remissions. Therefore, it is critical to identify new therapies for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Here, we define connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as a therapeutic target for metastatic melanoma. Clinically, CTGF expression correlates with tumor progression and is strongly induced by hypoxia through HIF-1 and HIF-2-dependent mechanisms. Genetic inhibition of CTGF in human melanoma cells is sufficient to significantly reduce orthotopic tumor growth, as well as metastatic tumor growth in the lung of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of CTGF decreased invasion and migration associated with reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Most importantly, the anti-CTGF antibody, FG-3019, had a profound inhibitory effect on the progression of established metastatic melanoma. These results offer the first preclinical validation of anti-CTGF therapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and underscore the importance of tumor hypoxia in melanoma progression."

Among these subtypes, it was recently demonstrated that mutations in H5 and H9 hemagglutinin (HA) in the context of lab-generated reassorted viruses conferred aerosol transmissibility in ferrets (a property shared by human adapted viruses). We previously demonstrated that the quantitative binding affinity of HA to α2→6 sialylated glycans (human receptors) is one of the important factors governing human adaptation of HA. Although the H7 subtype has infected humans causing varied clinical outcomes from mild conjunctivitis to severe respiratory illnesses, it is not clear where the HA of these subtypes stand in regard to human adaptation since its binding affinity to glycan receptors has not yet been quantified. In this study, we have quantitatively characterized the glycan receptor-binding specificity of HAs from representative strains of Eurasian (H7N7) and North American (H7N2) lineages that have caused human infection. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that two specific mutations; Gln226→Leu and Gly228→Ser in glycan receptor-binding site of H7 HA substantially increase its binding affinity to human receptor. Our findings contribute to a framework for monitoring the evolution of H7 HA to be able to adapt to human host."

https://openalex.org/W2159064053,"After being considered as a nuisance to be filtered out, it became recently clear that biochemical noise plays a complex role, often fully functional, for a genetic network. The influence of intrinsic and extrinsic noises on genetic networks has intensively been investigated in last ten years, though contributions on the co-presence of both are sparse. Extrinsic noise is usually modeled as an unbounded white or colored gaussian stochastic process, even though realistic stochastic perturbations are clearly bounded. In this paper we consider Gillespie-like stochastic models of nonlinear networks, i.e. the intrinsic noise, where the model jump rates are affected by colored bounded extrinsic noises synthesized by a suitable biochemical state-dependent Langevin system. These systems are described by a master equation, and a simulation algorithm to analyze them is derived. This new modeling paradigm should enlarge the class of systems amenable at modeling. We investigated the influence of both amplitude and autocorrelation time of a extrinsic Sine-Wiener noise on: $(i)$ the Michaelis-Menten approximation of noisy enzymatic reactions, which we show to be applicable also in co-presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic noise, $(ii)$ a model of enzymatic futile cycle and $(iii)$ a genetic toggle switch. In $(ii)$ and $(iii)$ we show that the presence of a bounded extrinsic noise induces qualitative modifications in the probability densities of the involved chemicals, where new modes emerge, thus suggesting the possibile functional role of bounded noises."
https://openalex.org/W2040757755,"BRCA1 mediates resistance to apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging agents, causing BRCA1 wild-type tumours to be significantly more resistant to DNA damage than their mutant counterparts. In this study, we demonstrate that following treatment with the DNA-damaging agents, etoposide or camptothecin, BRCA1 is required for the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and that BRCA1 and NF-κB cooperate to regulate the expression of the NF-κB antiapoptotic targets BCL2 and XIAP. We show that BRCA1 and the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA associate constitutively, whereas the p50 NF-κB subunit associates with BRCA1 only upon DNA damage treatment. Consistent with this BRCA1 and p65 are present constitutively on the promoters of BCL2 and XIAP, whereas p50 is recruited to these promoters only in damage treated cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the recruitment of p50 onto the promoters of BCL2 and XIAP is dependent upon BRCA1, but independent of its NF-κB partner subunit p65. The functional relevance of NF-κB activation by BRCA1 in response to etoposide and camptothecin is demonstrated by the significantly reduced survival of BRCA1 wild-type cells upon NF-κB inhibition. This study identifies a novel BRCA1-p50 complex, and demonstrates for the first time that NF-κB is required for BRCA1-mediated resistance to DNA damage. It reveals a functional interdependence between BRCA1 and NF-κB, further elucidating the role played by NF-κB in mediating cellular resistance of BRCA1 wild-type tumours to DNA-damaging agents."

Our statistical analysis of PB2 sequences showed that residue Lys(339) located in the cap-binding pocket of H5N1 PB2cap was gradually replaced by Thr(339) over the past decade. To understand the role of this amino acid polymorphism, we solved the crystal structures of PB2cap with or without a pre-mRNA cap analog, m(7)GTP, in the presence of Lys(339) or Thr(339). The structures showed that Lys(339) contributes to binding the γ-phosphate group of m(7)GTP, and the replacement of Lys(339) by Thr eliminates this interaction. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis showed that Thr(339) attenuated the PB2cap cap binding activity in vitro compared with Lys(339). Further functional studies confirmed that Thr(339)-PB2-containing ribonucleoprotein complex has a reduced influenza polymerase activity and RNA synthesis activity, and a reconstituted H5N1 virus containing the Thr(339) substitution exhibited a lower virulence to mice but more active replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The K339T substitution in the cap-binding pocket of PB2 modulates the polymerase activity and virulence by regulating the cap binding activity. It is informative to track variations in the cap-binding pocket of PB2 in surveillance of the evolution and spread of influenza virus."

Typically, tandem arrays of three or more ZFs bind DNA target sequences with high affinity and specificity, and the mode of DNA recognition is sufficiently well understood that tailor-made ZF-based DNA-binding proteins can be engineered. We have shown previously that a two-zinc finger unit found in the transcriptional coregulator ZNF217 recognizes DNA but with an affinity and specificity that is lower than other ZF arrays. To investigate the basis for these differences, we determined the structure of a ZNF217-DNA complex. We show that although the overall position of the ZFs on the DNA closely resembles that observed for other ZFs, the side-chain interaction pattern differs substantially from the canonical model. The structure also reveals the presence of two methyl-π interactions, each featuring a tyrosine contacting a thymine methyl group. To our knowledge, interactions of this type have not previously been described in classical ZF-DNA complexes. Finally, we investigated the sequence specificity of this two-ZF unit and discuss how ZNF217 might discriminate its target DNA sites in the cell.

ZFs are small domains (usually less than ∼100 amino acids) characterized by the presence of one or more zinc ions that stabilize(s) the fold. Many different structural classes of ZF have been discovered, and different classes can have similar or unrelated functions (1Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Structural classification of zinc fingers: survey and summary.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar).

By far the most abundant ZF domain, however, is the classical or C2H2 ZF, which is defined by a CX2–4CX12HX2–6H motif. Classical ZFs were the first discovered class of ZF (13Miller J. McLachlan A.D.

Biol. 2008; 8: 176Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), many of which harbor multiple ZF domains (up to 30 or more in some instances). In the majority of cases in which there are experimental data on classical ZFs, these domains are found in transcriptional regulatory proteins and act as sequence-specific DNA-binding modules, appearing in arrays of three of more domains in which each member contacts three base pairs of double-stranded DNA (15Pavletich N.P.

Klug A. Physical basis of a protein-DNA recognition code.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although a robust code has yet to be identified, some principles have emerged; the domains (which comprise a small β-hairpin and a single α-helix) insert the N-terminal end of their α-helix into the major groove of DNA, and typically 3–4 amino acid side chains in the helix make direct contacts with either the bases or the backbone of the DNA. Residues in the +2-, +3-, and +6-positions of the helix, together with the residue immediately preceding the helix (the −1-position), are most frequently found to make sequence-specific contacts (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1), whereas residues in the β-hairpin and in the conserved interdomain linker often make nonspecific electrostatic interactions with the phosphodiester backbone. In fact, the relatively conserved nature of these interactions, together with the robustness of the fold and the modularity of the interactions, have led to the creation of designer DNA-binding ZF proteins capable of delivering an associated activation, repression, or nuclease domain to a chosen genomic site (24Dreyer A.K.

Despite these successes and the apparently well understood DNA binding properties of classical ZF domains, a number of questions remain. For example, several ZFs have been shown to act as protein recognition modules (28Gamsjaeger R. Liew C.K. Loughlin F.E. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Sticky fingers: zinc-fingers as protein-recognition motifs.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) or to bind to RNA (29Brown R.S.

The prospects for designer single-stranded RNA-binding proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) rather than (or as well as) DNA, and currently we have no clear means by which to distinguish these different functional classes of ZF. Although DNA-binding ZFs tend to occur in clusters of three or more modules, there are hundreds of classical ZFs in the human genome that are found either as single isolated domains or as pairs, and the likelihood that these domains bind DNA is not known. Similarly, a significant number of proteins contain multiple ZF clusters distributed across a large amount of sequence, and the reasons underlying the presence of so many ZFs in a single protein are currently obscure. ZNF217 is an ∼1000-residue protein that has been identified as a candidate oncoprotein. High levels of ZNF217 are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer (31Vendrell J.A. Thollet A. Nguyen N.T. Ghayad S.E. Vinot S. Bièche I. Grisard E. Josserand V. Coll J.L. Roux P. Corbo L. Treilleux I. Rimokh R. Cohen P.A. ZNF217 is a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer that drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and overexpression of the ZNF217 gene in human mammary epithelial cells immortalizes those cells (32Nonet G.H. Stampfer M.R. Chin K. Gray J.W. Collins C.C. Yaswen P. The ZNF217 gene amplified in breast cancers promotes immortalization of human mammary epithelial cells.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1250-1254PubMed Google Scholar). ZNF217 contains seven predicted classical ZFs, found in two clusters in the N-terminal half of the protein. Although nothing is known about the function of the first cluster of five ZFs, a recent study demonstrated that the cluster comprising ZFs 6 and 7 (ZNF217_F67) can bind to double-stranded DNA (33Cowger J.J. Zhao Q. Isovic M. Torchia J. Biochemical characterization of the zinc-finger protein 217 transcriptional repressor complex: identification of a ZNF217 consensus recognition sequence.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3378-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A site selection experiment identified the consensus sequence CAGAAY as the preferred in vitro recognition site for ZNF217_F67. Subsequently, we identified an extended version of this consensus sequence to which stronger binding was observed in gel shifts: namely (T/A)(G/A)CAGAA(T/G/C) (34Nunez N. Clifton M.M. Funnell A.P. Artuz C. Hallal S. Quinlan K.G. Font J. Vandevenne M. Setiyaputra S. Pearson R.C. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. The multi-zinc finger protein ZNF217 contacts DNA through a two-finger domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38190-38201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments in which this sequence was incorporated into a promoter region showed that ZNF217 could act as a transcriptional repressor and that the activity was dependent on the structural integrity of the F67 unit. Surprisingly, we also observed that in vitro, the affinity of ZNF217_F67 for DNA was reduced by only 2-fold when the consensus sequence was extensively mutated, suggesting that this double ZF domain might have relatively low DNA binding specificity when compared with other transcriptional regulators that directly contact DNA. To understand the basis for these observations, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a ZNF217_F67-DNA complex by x-ray crystallography. Our data show that ZNF217 displays both similarities and significant differences from other ZF domains in the mechanism by which it recognizes DNA, making several base-specific contacts with DNA that have not previously been observed in classical ZF-DNA complexes. ZNF217 has an affinity of 25 nm for its target DNA site, and in solution, we also observed the formation of a lower affinity nonspecific complex between ZNF217_F67 and DNA at lower ionic strength. A combination of calorimetric and NMR data indicate that although this nonspecific complex involves the canonical DNA-binding surface of the protein, it is “looser” in nature, displaying less favorable bonding interactions. Interactions of this type might well play a role in the DNA recognition process in vivo for ZNF217 and other ZF proteins. A construct encoding F67 of human ZNF217 (amino acids 467–523) was cloned into pMALC2 and pGEX2T vectors to allow the expression of MBP and GST fusion proteins, respectively. The MBP construct was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 cells overnight at 25 °C following the addition of 0.7 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 1 μm ZnSO4 to the log phase culture. Expression of the GST fusion construct was induced overnight at 22 °C by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to E. coli BL21 cells supplemented with 1 μm ZnSO4. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. MBP and GST fusion proteins were recovered from the soluble fraction and purified by affinity chromatography. The fusion tags were cleaved using thrombin (3 h at room temperature) in 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT. F67 was then dialyzed into 50 mm Tris (pH 7), 1 mm DTT and further purified by cation-exchange chromatography (UnoS1, Bio-Rad). The construct identity and correct folding of F67 were confirmed by DNA sequencing and one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy, respectively. 15N-labeled ZNF217_F67 was prepared following the procedure of Cai et al. (35Cai M. Huang Y. Sakaguchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Craigie R. An efficient and cost-effective isotope labeling protocol for proteins expressed in Escherichia coli.J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and purified as described above. Three different double-stranded oligonucleotides, containing either one or two copies of the 8-bp consensus sequence TGCAGAAT, were used in efforts to crystallize a ZNF217_F67-DNA complex. All oligonucleotides were 20 residues in length with two complementary overhang nucleotides at the 5′ extremities of each strand. The first set of oligonucleotides contains two binding sites running in the same direction (forward, 5′-TTTGCAGAATCGTGCAGAAT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACGTCTTAGCACGTCTTAAA-3′). The second contains two binding sites running in opposite directions (forward, 5′-TTTGCAGAATCGATTCTGCA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACGTCTTAGCTAAGACGTAA-3′). The last contains a single binding site (forward, 5′-TTTCCATTGCAGAATTGTGG-3′; reverse, 3′-AGGTAACGTCTTAACACCAA-5′). ssDNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma and heated at 95 °C for 15 min in a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Oligonucleotides were then annealed at room temperature overnight and purified by size exclusion chromatography (Sephadex-75, GE Healthcare). Purified ZNF217_F67 and the different DNA duplexes were dialyzed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7), 50 mm NaCl. and 1 mm DTT before being mixed together (ZNF217_F67-DNA, 1:0.6 with the DNA duplexes that carried two binding sites and 1:1.2 with the oligonucleotide that contained a single site). The final protein concentration was 10 mg/ml. Initial crystallization trials were set up at 298 K as vapor diffusion hanging drops using a Mosquito robot (Molecular Dimensions) by mixing 400 nl of sample solution and 400 nl of reservoir solution and placing the resultant drop over 80 μl of reservoir solution in flat-bottom 96-well PS microplates (Greiner Bio-One). JSGC+ and PACT (Qiagen) screens were trialed. Large crystals in two different space groups were obtained with the oligonucleotide containing two binding sites running in opposite directions. Crystals in space group P6522 grew in the presence of 200 mm sodium acetate (pH 7), and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 precipitant solution. Crystals in space group C2 grew in 100 mm MES (pH 6), 10 mm zinc chloride, and 20% (v/v) PEG 6000. Diffraction data were recorded on a mar345 image plate detector (Marresearch) using x-rays produced by a Rigaku RU200H rotating-anode generator (CuKα) focused with Osmic mirrors (MSC Rigaku). The diffraction data were integrated and scaled with HKL-2000 (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). Phases for the P6522 crystal form were determined using the SIRAS technique with a lead derivative. Crystals were soaked for 2 h in crystallization buffer containing 10 mm trimethyl lead, and a 3.0-Å data set was collected. SIRAS phasing was realized using AutoSol (37Terwilliger T.C. Adams P.D. Read R.J. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Afonine P.V. Zwart P.H. Hung L.W. Decision-making in structure solution using Bayesian estimates of map quality: the PHENIX AutoSol wizard.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 582-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), which identified two lead atoms and resulted in a mean figure of merit after density modification of 0.69. The resulting electron density was of sufficient quality to allow building of the oligonucleotide and peptide backbone. Successive rounds of model building were carried out using Coot (38Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar), and refinement utilized REFMAC5 (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar). Combined TLS (translation/libration/screw) and individual atomic displacement parameter refinement were also carried out in the final stages. The C2 crystal form phase was solved by molecular replacement with the P6522 model using PHASER (40McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar). Model building and refinement were performed similarly to that described for the P6522 form. Four additional zinc ions were identified in the asymmetric unit. Due to their absence in the P6522 crystal form and their location on the surface of the protein-nucleic acid complex, we attribute these atoms to the presence of 10 mm ZnCl2 in the crystallization solution. Cleaved or GST-tagged ZNF217_F67 and 5′-fluorescein-labeled dsDNA oligonucleotides (WT sequence forward, 5′-Fl-TCCATTGCAGAATTGTGG-3′; mutated sequence, forward, 5′-Fl-TCCATCTGGAGTATGTGG-3′; poly(A), forward, 5′-Fl-(A)18-3′; the bold sequences correspond to the 8 bp consensus sequence and its mutated version recognized by ZNF217) were dialyzed into a 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. Fluorescence anisotropy titrations were performed at 25 °C on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with a slit width of 10 nm, and data were averaged over 15 s. The excitation and detection wavelengths were 495 and 520 nm, respectively. In each titration, the fluorescence anisotropy of a solution of 50 nm fluorescein-tagged dsDNA was measured as a function of the added protein concentration. Binding data were fitted to a simple 1:1 binding model by nonlinear least squares regression. Each titration was performed three times, and the final affinity was taken as the mean of these measurements. ZNF217_F67 and the two DNA duplexes (see above) were dialyzed overnight against the same reservoir of buffer containing 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Titrations were also carried out at 150 mm NaCl. ZNF217_F67 (200 μm) was titrated into DNA (20 μm). Titrations were carried out on a MicroCal i200 ITC microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. For each titration, an initial injection of 0.2 μl (data from which were discarded) and 20 injections of 2 μl of titrant were made at 120-s intervals. Data were corrected for heats of dilution from control experiments of the protein into buffer and analyzed using Origin7.0 (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). The two-binding-event titration curve observed for the ZNF217 binding to the specific DNA sequence could not be fitted with confidence using a two-site model because the error associated with this fit was above 100%. We therefore made the assumption that the second, low affinity binding event was identical to the single binding event observed during the titration of the mutated sequence. Using this assumption, we subtracted from the first titration the data points observed for the latter titration and could then fit the remaining data to a single binding event with an associated error under 20%. The derived dissociation constant for the tight interaction was indistinguishable from that obtained with the two-site model, except that the uncertainty in the fit was substantially lower for the single-site fit. For 15N HSQC chemical shift perturbation experiments, purified 15N-labeled ZNF217_F67 and the different dsDNA oligonucleotides were extensively dialyzed into a buffer comprising 10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and were concentrated to ∼300 μm. All NMR samples contained 5–10% D2O and 10 μm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid as a chemical shift reference. All experiments were run at 298 K on either a 600-MHz or an 800-MHz Bruker AvanceIII spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. 15N HSQC spectra were recorded for the ZNF217_F67 alone and following the addition of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.5 molar eq of either wild type (WT) or nonspecific DNA. The interaction between ZNF217_F67 and nonspecific DNA was in fast exchange, allowing straightforward resonance assignment from the titration data. NOESY spectra were also recorded to confirm these assignments. NMR data were processed using Topspin (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) and analyzed with SPARKY (76Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2007Google Scholar). To understand the DNA binding activity of the F67 double-ZF module of ZNF217, we set up crystallization trials with a recombinant protein containing residues 467–523 of human ZNF217 and several different dsDNA oligonucleotides. Each DNA fragment contained either one or two copies of the 8-bp sequence TGCAGAAT, derived from published systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) data (33Cowger J.J. Zhao Q. Isovic M. Torchia J. Biochemical characterization of the zinc-finger protein 217 transcriptional repressor complex: identification of a ZNF217 consensus recognition sequence.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3378-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); we call this sequence WT DNA. Crystals were obtained with all the tested DNA fragments, but the biggest crystals with optimum diffraction were obtained for the oligonucleotide containing two binding sites running in opposite directions. The rationale for this approach to oligonucleotide design was that the consequent creation of a two-fold symmetry axis within the oligonucleotide and also within the protein-DNA complex might improve the likelihood of crystallization. Data were collected for two crystals that belonged to different space groups: P6522 and C2; these crystals diffracted to 2.6 and 2.1 Å, respectively. Phases for the P6522 form were obtained by SIRAS phasing using a heavy atom derivative created by soaking a crystal in trimethyl lead acetate, and a model was built. Phases for the second crystal form were obtained by molecular replacement using the model built from the P6522 crystal form. The Rcryst of the final model (of the C2 form) is 22.4%, and the Rfree is 25.6%. All residues were visible in the final electron density except for the N-terminal residues Gly-467–Ser-470 and C-terminal Lys-523, presumably due to disorder.

https://openalex.org/W1997509856,"It is well known that protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that become oxidized due to exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) undergo a conformational change and are inactivated. However, whether PTPs can actively regulate ROS levels in order to prevent PTP inhibition has yet to be investigated. Here, we demonstrate that PTP non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12) protects cells against aberrant ROS accumulation and death induced by oxidative stress. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in PTPN12 underwent increased ROS-induced apoptosis under conditions of antioxidant depletion. Cells lacking PTPN12 also showed defective activation of FOXO1/3a, transcription factors required for the upregulation of several antioxidant genes. PTPN12-mediated regulation of ROS appeared to be mediated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), which was hyperstimulated in the absence of PTPN12. As tight regulation of ROS to sustain survival is a key feature of cancer cells, we examined PTPN12 levels in tumors from a cohort of breast cancer patients. Patients whose tumors showed high levels of PTPN12 transcripts had a significantly poorer prognosis. Analysis of tissues from patients with various breast cancer subtypes revealed that more triple-negative breast cancers, the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, showed high PTPN12 expression than any other subtype. Furthermore, both human breast cancer cells and mouse mammary epithelial tumor cells engineered to lack PTPN12 exhibited reduced tumorigenic and metastatic potential in vivo that correlated with their elevated ROS levels. The involvement of PTPN12 in the antioxidant response of breast cancer cells suggests that PTPN12 may represent a novel therapeutic target for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2067964544,"Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase, a central regulator of the DNA damage response, regulates the activity of several E3-ubiquitin ligases, and the ubiquitination-proteasome system is a consistent target of ATM. ITCH is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that modulates the ubiquitination of several targets, therefore participating to the regulation of several cellular responses, such as the DNA damage response, tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα), Notch and Hedgehog signaling, and the differentiation of ‘naive’ lymphocytes into T helper type 2 cells. Here we uncover ATM as a novel positive modulator of ITCH E3-ubiquitin ligase activity. A single residue on ITCH protein, S161, which is part of an ATM SQ consensus motif, is required for ATM-dependent activation of ITCH. ATM activity enhances ITCH enzymatic activity, which in turn drives the ubiquitination and degradation of c-FLIP-L and c-Jun, previously identified as ITCH substrates. Importantly, ATM-deficient mice show resistance to hepatocyte cell death, similarly to Itch-deficient animals, providing in vivo genetic evidence for this circuit. Our data identify ITCH as a novel component of the ATM-dependent signaling pathway and suggest that the impairment of the correct functionality of ITCH caused by Atm deficiency may contribute to the complex clinical features linked to Ataxia Telangiectasia."
https://openalex.org/W2067356799,"The androgen receptor (AR) has a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PC) and is a major therapeutic target in this disease. The transcriptional activity of AR is modulated by the coregulators with which it interacts, and consequently deregulation of cofactor expression and/or activity impacts the expression of genes whose products can have a role in PC pathogenesis. Here we report that E74-like factor 3 (ELF3), a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, is a repressor of AR transcriptional activity. Exogenous expression of ELF3 represses AR transcriptional activity when assessed using reporter-based transfection assays or when evaluated on endogenous AR target genes. Conversely, ELF3 knock down increases the AR transcriptional activity. Biochemical dissection of this activity indicates that it results from the physical interaction between ELF3 and AR and that this interaction inhibits the recruitment of AR to specific androgen response elements within target gene promoters. Significantly, we observed that depletion of ELF3 expression in LNCaP cells promotes cell migration, whereas increased ELF3 expression severely inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Taken together, these results suggest that modulation of ELF3 expression and/or AR/ELF3 interaction may have utility in the treatment of PC."
https://openalex.org/W2078199784,"Background Rwanda's National PMTCT program aims to achieve elimination of new HIV infections in children by 2015. In November 2010, Rwanda adopted the WHO 2010 ARV guidelines for PMTCT recommending Option B (HAART) for all HIV-positive pregnant women extended throughout breastfeeding and discontinued (short course-HAART) only for those not eligible for life treatment. The current study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of this policy choice. Methods Based on a cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women in Rwanda, we modelled the cost-effectiveness of six regimens: dual ARV prophylaxis with either 12 months breastfeeding or replacement feeding; short course HAART (Sc-HAART) prophylaxis with either 6 months breastfeeding, 12 months breastfeeding, or 18 months breastfeeding; and Sc-HAART prophylaxis with replacement feeding. Direct costs were modelled based on all inputs in each scenario and related unit costs. Effectiveness was evaluated by measuring HIV-free survival at 18 months. Savings correspond to the lifetime costs of HIV treatment and care avoided as a result of all vertical HIV infections averted. Results All PMTCT scenarios considered are cost saving compared to “no intervention.” Sc-HAART with 12 months breastfeeding or 6 months breastfeeding dominate all other scenarios. Sc-HAART with 12 months breastfeeding allows for more children to be alive and HIV-uninfected by 18 months than Sc-HAART with 6 months breastfeeding for an incremental cost per child alive and uninfected of 11,882 USD. This conclusion is sensitive to changes in the relative risk of mortality by 18 months for exposed HIV-uninfected children on replacement feeding from birth and those who were breastfed for only 6 months compared to those breastfeeding for 12 months or more. Conclusion Our findings support the earlier decision by Rwanda to adopt WHO Option B and could inform alternatives for breastfeeding duration. Local contexts and existing care delivery models should be part of national policy decisions."
https://openalex.org/W1974797760,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and p38(MAPK) are protein kinases that transduce extracellular signals regulating cell migration and actin cytoskeletal organization. ILK-dependent regulation of p38(MAPK) is critical for mammalian kidney development and in smooth muscle cell migration, however, specific p38 isoforms has not been previously examined in ILK-regulated responses. Signaling by ILK and p38(MAPK) is often dysregulated in bladder cancer, and here we report a strong positive correlation between protein levels of ILK and p38β, which is the predominant isoform found in bladder cancer cells, as well as in patient-matched normal bladder and tumor samples. Knockdown by RNA interference of either p38β or ILK disrupts serum-induced, Rac1-dependent migration and actin cytoskeletal organization in bladder cancer cells. Surprisingly, ILK knockdown causes the selective reduction in p38β cellular protein level, without inhibiting p38β messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. The loss of p38β protein in ILK-depleted cells is partially rescued by the 26S proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Using co-precipitation and bimolecular fluorescent complementation assays, we find that ILK selectively forms cytoplasmic complexes with p38β. In situ proximity ligation assays further demonstrate that serum-stimulated assembly of endogenous ILK-p38β complexes is sensitive to QLT-0267, a small molecule ILK kinase inhibitor. Finally, inhibition of ILK reduces the amplitude and period of serum-induced activation of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), a target of p38β implicated in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Our work identifies Hsp27 as a novel target of ILK-p38β signaling complexes, playing a key role in bladder cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2001042875,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of CD5+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and bone marrow. The main feature of the disease is accumulation of the malignant cells due to decreased apoptosis. CD84 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activating molecule family of immunoreceptors, and has an unknown function in CLL cells. Here, we show that the expression of CD84 is significantly elevated from the early stages of the disease, and is regulated by macrophage migration inhibitory factor and its receptor, CD74. Activation of cell surface CD84 initiates a signaling cascade that enhances CLL cell survival. Both downmodulation of CD84 expression and its immune-mediated blockade induce cell death in vitro and in vivo. In addition, analysis of samples derived from an on-going clinical trial, in which human subjects were treated with humanized anti-CD74 (milatuzumab), shows a decrease in CD84 messenger RNA and protein levels in milatuzumab-treated cells. This downregulation was correlated with reduction of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression. Thus, our data show that overexpression of CD84 in CLL is an important survival mechanism that appears to be an early event in the pathogenesis of the disease. These findings suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on the blockade of this CD84-dependent survival pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2033708184,"Campylobacter is genetically highly diverse and undergoes frequent intraspecific recombination. Turkeys have been identified as an important reservoir for Campylobacter jejuni which is of public health significance. The assessment of the genetic diversity among Campylobacter population is critical for our understanding of the epidemiology of this bacterium. The genetic profiles were different according to the molecular typing methods used. The performance of established flaA genotyping, multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) and DNA microarray assay based on the ArrayTube™ technology was evaluated using 14 Campylobacter jejuni isolated from a commercial turkey flock. The flaA typing was performed using PCR-RFLP with restriction enzymes Sau3AI, AluI, a 'composite' flaA analysis of AluI and Sau3AI and DdeI. The 14 isolates were differentiated into 3, 5, 7 and 9 genotypes, respectively. Entire flaA gene and short variable region (SVR) sequences were analysed. Sequencing of the entire flaA provided 11 different genotypes. flaA-SVR sequence analysis detected 8 flaA alleles and 4 flaA peptides. One new flaA allele type (528) was identified. MLST analysis represented 10 different sequence types (STs) and 5 clonal complexes (CCs). The microarray assay recognised 14 different genotypes. The discriminatory indices were 0.560, 0.802, 0.857, and 0.912 for flaA-RFLP depending on the used enzymes, 0.890 for flaA-SVR, 0.967 for entire flaA sequencing, 0.945 for MLST and 1.00 for the DNA microarray assay. The flaA gene was genetically stable over 20 passages on blood agar. In conclusion, the different typing tools demonstrated a high level of genetic heterogeneity of Campylobacter jejuni in a turkey flock, indicating that a single flock can be infected by multiple genotypes within one rearing cycle. DNA microarray-based assays had the highest discriminatory power when compared with other genotyping tools."
https://openalex.org/W2022042240,"In Japanese, vowel duration can distinguish the meaning of words. In order for infants to learn this phonemic contrast using simple distributional analyses, there should be reliable differences in the duration of short and long vowels, and the frequency distribution of vowels must make these differences salient enough in the input. In this study, we evaluate these requirements of phonemic learning by analyzing the duration of vowels from over 11 hours of Japanese infant-directed speech. We found that long vowels are substantially longer than short vowels in the input directed to infants, for each of the five oral vowels. However, we also found that learning phonemic length from the overall distribution of vowel duration is not going to be easy for a simple distributional learner, because of the large base-rate effect (i.e., 94% of vowels are short), and because of the many factors that influence vowel duration (e.g., intonational phrase boundaries, word boundaries, and vowel height). Therefore, a successful learner would need to take into account additional factors such as prosodic and lexical cues in order to discover that duration can contrast the meaning of words in Japanese. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account the naturalistic distributions of lexicons and acoustic cues when modeling early phonemic learning."
https://openalex.org/W2139046935,"The parasitic protozoan organism Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease. The insect vector-dwelling epimastigote form of the organism expresses a low abundance glycoprotein associated with the flagellum adhesion zone, called gp72. The gp72 glycoprotein was first identified with an anti-carbohydrate IgG3 monoclonal antibody called WIC29.26 and has been shown to have an unusual sugar composition. Here, we describe a new way to isolate the WIC29.26 carbohydrate epitope of gp72. Using (1)H NMR and mass spectrometry before and after derivatization, we provide an almost complete primary chemical structure for the epitope, which is that of a complex phosphosaccharide: Galfβ1-4Rhapα1-2Fucpα1-4(Galpβ1-3)(Galpα1-2)Xylpβ1-4Xylpβ1-3(Xylpβ1-2Galpα1-4(Galpβ1-3)(Rhapα1-2)Fucpα1-4)GlcNAcp, with phosphate attached to one or other of the two Galp terminal residues and in which all residues are of the d-absolute configuration, except for fucose and rhamnose which are l. Combined with previous data (Haynes, P. A., Ferguson, M. A., and Cross, G. A. (1996) Glycobiology 6, 869-878), we postulate that this complex structure and its variants lacking one or more residues are linked to Thr and Ser residues in gp72 via a phosphodiester linkage (GlcNAcpα1-P-Thr/Ser) and that these units may form phosphosaccharide repeats through GlcNAcpα1-P-Galp linkages. The gp72 glycoprotein is associated with the flagellum adhesion zone on the parasite surface, and its ligation has been implicated in inhibiting parasite differentiation from the epimastigote to the metacyclic trypomastigote stage. The detailed structure of the unique phosphosaccharide component of gp72 reported here provides a template for future biosynthetic and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2079542882,"The human transcription elongation regulator TCERG1 physically couples transcription elongation and splicing events by interacting with splicing factors through its N-terminal WW domains and the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II through its C-terminal FF domains. Here, we report biochemical and structural characterization of the C-terminal three FF domains (FF4-6) of TCERG1, revealing a rigid integral domain structure of the tandem FF repeat that interacts with the hyperphosphorylated CTD (PCTD). Although FF4 and FF5 adopt a classical FF domain fold containing three orthogonally packed α helices and a 310 helix, FF6 contains an additional insertion helix between α1 and α2. The formation of the integral tandem FF4-6 repeat is achieved by merging the last helix of the preceding FF domain and the first helix of the following FF domain and by direct interactions between neighboring FF domains. Using peptide column binding assays and NMR titrations, we show that binding of the FF4-6 tandem repeat to the PCTD requires simultaneous phosphorylation at Ser(2), Ser(5), and Ser(7) positions within two consecutive Y(1)S(2)P(3)T(4)S(5)P(6)S(7) heptad repeats. Such a sequence-specific PCTD recognition is achieved through CTD-docking sites on FF4 and FF5 of TCERG1 but not FF6. Our study presents the first example of a nuclear factor requiring all three phospho-Ser marks within the heptad repeat of the CTD for high affinity binding and provides a molecular interpretation for the biochemical connection between the Ser(7) phosphorylation enrichment in the CTD of the transcribing RNA polymerase II over introns and co-transcriptional splicing events."

https://openalex.org/W1982492157,"We construct a stress p53-Mdm2-p300-HDAC1 regulatory network that is activated and stabilised by two regulatory proteins, p300 and HDAC1. Different activation levels of [Formula: see text] observed due to these regulators during stress condition have been investigated using a deterministic as well as a stochastic approach to understand how the cell responds during stress conditions. We found that these regulators help in adjusting p53 to different conditions as identified by various oscillatory states, namely fixed point oscillations, damped oscillations and sustain oscillations. On assessing the impact of p300 on p53-Mdm2 network we identified three states: first stabilised or normal condition where the impact of p300 is negligible, second an interim region where p53 is activated due to interaction between p53 and p300, and finally the third regime where excess of p300 leads to cell stress condition. Similarly evaluation of HDAC1 on our model led to identification of the above three distinct states. Also we observe that noise in stochastic cellular system helps to reach each oscillatory state quicker than those in deterministic case. The constructed model validated different experimental findings qualitatively."
https://openalex.org/W2112838506,"Background Improved characterization of infectious disease dynamics is required. To that end, three-dimensional (3D) data analysis of feedback-like processes may be considered. Methods To detect infectious disease data patterns, a systems biology (SB) and evolutionary biology (EB) approach was evaluated, which utilizes leukocyte data structures designed to diminish data variability and enhance discrimination. Using data collected from one avian and two mammalian (human and bovine) species infected with viral, parasite, or bacterial agents (both sensitive and resistant to antimicrobials), four data structures were explored: (i) counts or percentages of a single leukocyte type, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, or macrophages (the classic approach), and three levels of the SB/EB approach, which assessed (ii) 2D, (iii) 3D, and (iv) multi-dimensional (rotating 3D) host-microbial interactions. Results In all studies, no classic data structure discriminated disease-positive (D+, or observations in which a microbe was isolated) from disease-negative (D–, or microbial-negative) groups: D+ and D– data distributions overlapped. In contrast, multi-dimensional analysis of indicators designed to possess desirable features, such as a single line of observations, displayed a continuous, circular data structure, whose abrupt inflections facilitated partitioning into subsets statistically significantly different from one another. In all studies, the 3D, SB/EB approach distinguished three (steady, positive, and negative) feedback phases, in which D– data characterized the steady state phase, and D+ data were found in the positive and negative phases. In humans, spatial patterns revealed false-negative observations and three malaria-positive data classes. In both humans and bovines, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were discriminated from non-MRSA infections. Conclusions More information can be extracted, from the same data, provided that data are structured, their 3D relationships are considered, and well-conserved (feedback-like) functions are estimated. Patterns emerging from such structures may distinguish well-conserved from recently developed host-microbial interactions. Applications include diagnosis, error detection, and modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2094824343,"The HER family is composed of four receptor tyrosine kinases, which are frequently deregulated in several types of cancer. Activated HER receptors initiate intracellular signalling pathways by attracting to the plasma membrane a plethora of adaptor and signalling molecules. Although there are more than a dozen HER-interacting proteins that regulate signal transduction and have been extensively studied, recent proteomic studies have shown the existence of many novel but largely uncharacterized factors that may bind HER receptors. In this report, we describe a cell-based identification of several new HER2-binding proteins, including HAX1, YWHAZ, PELO and ACP1. Analysis of these factors showed that one of them, PELO, binds to active HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor and thereby attenuates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling, likely through regulation of the recruitment of p85-PI3K to activated receptor. Functional characterization of PELO showed that it negatively regulates cell migration and metastasis in vivo. These results reveal that PELO is a novel regulator of HER-signalling and therefore is likely to have a role in inhibiting tumour progression and invasion."
