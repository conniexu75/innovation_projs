This feeling of ownership of our limbs is a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness. We have studied the neuronal counterparts of this experience. A perceptual illusion was used to manipulate feelings of ownership of a rubber hand presented in front of healthy subjects while brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The neural activity in the premotor cortex reflected the feeling of ownership of the hand. This suggests that multisensory integration in the premotor cortex provides a mechanism for bodily self-attribution."
https://openalex.org/W2120276758,"Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of adult vision loss and blindness. Much of the retinal damage that characterizes the disease results from retinal vascular leakage and nonperfusion. Diabetic retinal vascular leakage, capillary nonperfusion, and endothelial cell damage are temporary and spatially associated with retinal leukocyte stasis in early experimental diabetes. Retinal leukostasis increases within days of developing diabetes and correlates with the increased expression of retinal intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and CD18. Mice deficient in the genes encoding for the leukocyte adhesion molecules CD18 and ICAM-1 were studied in two models of diabetic retinopathy with respect to the long-term development of retinal vascular lesions. CD18-/- and ICAM-1-/- mice demonstrate significantly fewer adherent leukocytes in the retinal vasculature at 11 and 15 months after induction of diabetes with STZ. This condition is associated with fewer damaged endothelial cells and lesser vascular leakage. Galactosemia of up to 24 months causes pericyte and endothelial cell loss and formation of acellular capillaries. These changes are significantly reduced in CD18- and ICAM-1-deficient mice. Basement membrane thickening of the retinal vessels is increased in long-term galactosemic animals independent of the genetic strain. Here we show that chronic, low-grade subclinical inflammation is responsible for many of the signature vascular lesions of diabetic retinopathy. These data highlight the central and causal role of adherent leukocytes in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. They also underscore the potential utility of anti-inflammatory treatment in diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1971748110,"cAMP is a universal second messenger of many G-protein-coupled receptors and regulates a wide variety of cellular events. cAMP exerts its effects via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), cAMP-gated ion channels, and two isoforms of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac). Here we report the development of novel fluorescent indicators for cAMP based on the cAMP-binding domains of Epac and PKA. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) fused directly to the cAMP-binding domains was used to analyze spatial and temporal aspects of cAMP-signaling in different cells. In contrast to previously developed PKA-based indicators, these probes are comprised of only a single binding site lacking cooperativity, catalytic properties, and interactions with other proteins and thereby allow us to easily image free intracellular cAMP and rapid signaling events. Rapid β-adrenergic receptor-induced cAMP signals were observed to travel with high speed (≈40 μm/s) throughout the entire cell body of hippocampal neurons and peritoneal macrophages.

The developed indicators could be ubiquitously applied to studying cAMP, its physiological role and spatio-temporal regulation. The second messenger cAMP was discovered in the early 1950s, and since then its cellular function and regulation have been gaining increased interest (1Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2003; 425: 730-740Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar). A few years ago new avenues for cAMP research have been opened up by discovery of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), 1The abbreviation used are: Epac, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PKA, protein kinase A; CFP, YFP, GFP, enhanced cyan, yellow, and green fluorescent proteins, respectively; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. which in addition to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) represents an important intracellular effector for cAMP and appears to account for many of its effects (10Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAMP-binding proteins such as cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (9Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 730-740Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar) and neuropathy target esterase (11Dremier S. Kopperud R. Doskeland S.O. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have been identified, demonstrating functional heterogeneity of cAMP signaling. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) or rhodamine and fluorescein fused to the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA has been described for cAMP imaging (12Zaccolo M. De Giorgi F. Cho C.Y. Feng L. Knapp T. Negulescu P.A. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 13Bacskai B.J. Hochner B.

Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Because PKA has a complex mechanism of activation (cooperative cAMP binding to four interconnected sites of different affinities) (16Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as well as potent regulatory functions in cells, we sought to develop simpler sensors based on individual cAMP-binding domains lacking catalytic properties and cooperative binding. Fusing single binding domains of PKA and Epac with GFP variants we obtained several highly sensitive cAMP sensors, which give new insights into spatio-temporal and regulatory patterns of receptor-mediated responses of cAMP. Construction of Fluorescent cAMP Indicators—The DNA constructs encoding for cAMP-sensing proteins were generated by PCR using human Epac1 (GenBank™ accession number AF103905), murine Epac2 (AF115480), or murine PKA regulatory type IIβ subunit (M12492) cDNA as a template. GFP variants were amplified with standard primers from pEYFP and pECFP (Clontech) and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) for transient expression in mammalian cells. For purification, the Epac2-camps (for cAMPsensor) cDNA was cloned into pVL1393 vector (Invitrogen), and a sequence encoding for a hexa-histidine tag was inserted directly on the N terminus. The protein was expressed in Sf9 cells (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) and purified using a nickel-agarose method (Qiagen). Cell Culture—CHO cells stably expressing adenosine A2B receptors and TsA201 and HEK293 cells stably expressing β1- or β2-adrenergic receptors were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (37 °C, 5% CO2) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (37 °C, 7% CO2) medium, respectively, plated onto 24-mm glass coverslips for imaging experiments or 90-mm Petri dishes for cuvette fluorometric measurements, and transfected with 3 or 30 μg, respectively, of DNA for each construct using the calcium phosphate method. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from 10–12-week-old FVB/N mice as described (17Odaka C. Mizuochi T. Yang J. Ding A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately transfected by electroporation using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V, 500 microfarads, seeded onto 24-mm glass coverslips, and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (37 °C, 5% CO2). Primary dissociated mouse hippocampus neurons were isolated from neonatal (P1) C57BL/6 mice and cultured as described previously (18Dityatev A. Dityateva G. Schachner M. Neuron. 2000; 26: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Hippocampi were dissociated by incubation for 20 min in Tyrode's solution containing ispase (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany) and collagenase and desoxyribonuclease I (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Primary neurons were transiently transfected with the Nucleofector system (Amaxa, Köln, Germany). Briefly, 3–4 × 106 freshly dissociated cells were electroporated with 3–5 μg of plasmid DNA, and cells were plated on poly-l-lysine and Matrigel-coated (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) glass slides in Neurobasal-A medium for 3–5 days. 18 h after transfection, 5 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to prevent proliferation of glial cells. All animal procedures were approved by the responsible government authority (protocol number 621-2531.01-10/98). FRET Measurements and Cell Imaging—Fluorescent microscopy was done as described (19Vilardaga J.P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) with adherent cells using a CoolSNAP-HQ CCD camera and a beam splitter 505 DCXR. The imaging data were analyzed with MetaMorph 5.0 (Visitron Systems) and Origin (Microcal, Amherst, MA) software. To study agonist-induced changes in FRET, cells were continuously superfused with buffer A plus agonists. For local stimulation of a cell, patch pipettes (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, UK) filled with the respective agonists were accurately positioned onto the plasma membrane by a manipulator (Patchman, Eppendorf, Germany). To avoid free agonist diffusion along the membrane, cells were continuously superfused with laminar flow of buffer in the direction opposite to the pipette. Fluorescence Measurements in Vitro—TsA201 cells 24 h post-transfection were washed thrice with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the plate, and resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH = 7.3). After disruption with an Ultraturrax device for 40 s on ice and 20-min centrifugation at 80,000 rpm, fluorescence emission spectra of the supernatant (excitation at 436 nm, emission range 460–550 nm) were measured with a fluorescence spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) before and after adding various concentrations of cAMP, cGMP, AMP, or ATP (Sigma). Purified proteins from Sf9 cells were diluted prior to measurements in the same buffer to 40 nm final concentration. CAMP saturation curves were plotted using KaleidaGraph 3.0.5 software (Abelbeck). Development of Novel Fluorescent cAMP Indicators—Several fusion proteins were generated that contained a single or both cAMP-binding domains of Epac1, Epac2, or PKA regulatory βII-subunit fused to GFP variants at different positions (Fig. 1A). Based on structural data for cAMP binding to Epac2 (20Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. De Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that positioning of YFP and CFP directly on α-helices H4 and α6:B, encompassing the cAMP-binding domain B of Epac2, might lead to a change in the distance between the fluorophores due to a cAMP-induced conformational switch (Fig. 1B). We obtained a fusion protein termed Epac2-camps exhibiting FRET that decreased upon addition of cAMP (Fig. 1C), compatible with an increased distance of the CFP and YFP moieties as deduced from structural predictions of the cAMP-induced conformational change (see arrow in Fig. 1B). This decrease in FRET in response to cAMP was specific, since fluorometric measurements in vitro using Epac2-camps purified from Sf9 cells further demonstrated that other nucleotides were recognized only weakly (e.g. AMP, >10 mm; ATP, 2.5 ± 0.4 mm; cGMP, 10.6 ± 0.4 μm). Using this experimental system we sought to compare the novel system with the previously developed PKA-based approach (12Zaccolo M. De Giorgi F. Cho C.Y. Feng L. Knapp T. Negulescu P.A. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Measuring activation of purified proteins in vitro, we observed a lower speed of cAMP-induced PKA complex dissociation, which was even slower in the presence of lower cAMP concentrations, whereas the Epac2-camps was switched on much more rapidly at all cAMP concentrations with kinetics faster than our experimental setup allowed to resolve (0.5 Hz sampling rate; Fig. 1, D and E). This demonstrates higher temporal resolution of the new single-domain sensor. FRET Measurements in Living Cells—To monitor agonist-induced cAMP accumulation in living cells (CHO, COS7, HEK293) we transfected them with Epac2-camps. FRET between the CFP and YFP moieties was confirmed both by ratiometric measurements (Fig. 2A) and by acceptor photobleaching resulting in 15.5 ± 1.6% donor dequenching (n = 4, data not shown). Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with adenosine in CHO cells stably expressing adenosine A2B receptors (CHO-A2B) and transiently transfected with Epac2-camps led to a decrease in the FRET signal, reflecting a rise in intracellular cAMP (Fig. 2A). A direct comparison of Epac2-camps with the tetrameric PKA system (12Zaccolo M. De Giorgi F. Cho C.Y. Feng L. Knapp T. Negulescu P.A. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) uncovered that Epac2-camps reacted to adenylyl cyclase stimulation much more rapidly (Fig. 2B) in accordance with the faster activation kinetics of the new indicator observed in vitro (Fig. 1, C and D). Comparison of the in vitro kinetics and the kinetics in intact cells reveals that the response of the Epac-based sensor may be limited by the kinetics of cAMP production, whereas the tetrameric PKA sensor is limited primarily by activation kinetics of the sensor itself (binding of four cAMPs and subsequent subunit dissociation). Having shown that a single cAMP-binding domain is sufficient to generate a conformational change detectable by FRET, we optimized the position of fluorophore insertion using again the CHO-A2B cells and stimulation with adenosine (Figs. 1A and 2C). We next generated similar sensors using the cAMP-binding domains of Epac1 and PKA regulatory βII-subunit (see Fig. 1, A and B). These constructs, termed Epac1-camps and PKA-camps, respectively, likewise displayed cAMP-induced changes in FRET but had slightly (≈2.5-fold) lower affinities for cAMP (Fig. 2D), which correspond well with binding data for single domains of Epac1 and -2 (21de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These results support the concept of a common mechanism of ligand-induced conformational change for cAMP-binding proteins (10Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 21de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). FRET measurements in single cells stably expressing β1-adrenergic receptors (HEK-β1AR) further demonstrated similar activation properties of Epac1-, Epac2-, and PKA-camps (Fig. 2E) but revealed a significantly larger signal amplitude and activation speed for Epac1-camps, which was, therefore, used in all further assays. Imaging experiments with Epac1-camps were then done to view the spatial properties of intracellular cAMP signals. Expression of Epac1-camps in individual CHO-A2B cells (Fig. 2F) and other cells showed uniform distribution throughout the cytosol (as judged from simple YFP fluorescence), which is presumably due to the fact that the sensor contains only the cAMP-binding domain of Epac. Ratiometric imaging allowed the determination of FRET, and stimulation of A2B receptors with adenosine caused a decrease in the FRET signal throughout the cells (Fig. 2F). Rapid Gradients of cAMP—It has been argued over decades whether cAMP acts in cells as a freely diffusing second messenger or whether such signals are more localized (22Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 751-773Crossref Scopus (628) Google Scholar). PKA-dependent β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of L-type calcium channels in primary hippocampal neurons (23Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) as well as PKA activation in cardiac myocytes (15Zaccolo M. Pozzan T. Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) has been suggested to occur in spatially restricted signaling complexes. To assess the spatio-temporal aspects of cAMP-induced Epac signaling, we transfected primary hippocampal neurons with Epac1-camps. The Epac1-camps-expressing cells were then stimulated with the β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (50 nm) delivered locally with a patch pipette. This local stimulation resulted in a rapidly spreading change in the FRET signal, reflecting a rise in cAMP propagating from the site of stimulation through the whole neuron on the scale of a few hundred milliseconds (Fig. 3A; supplemental Movie 1). Rapidly spreading cAMP signals were also observed with Epac1-camps in other cells, including mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated locally with isoprenaline (Fig. 3B). In CHO-A2B cells, as well as in PC12 cells with endogenous adenosine A2A receptors (24Arslan G. Kull B. Fredholm B.B. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), similar spatial patterns of cAMP responses to adenosine were observed (not shown). Measuring these rapidly propagating FRET changes in many cells enabled us to calculate the speed of the cAMP gradient in neurons. To do so, we fitted the FRET signals in different regions of the cell (Fig. 3A) to a first-order exponential function and defined the intersection of the fit with the base line as the time of activation. The speed of the cAMP gradients after local stimulation with 50 nm isoprenaline was calculated at almost 40 μm/s, from which a diffusion coefficient at 487 ± 23 μm2/s was derived. This is much faster than previously described for cells stimulated with neurotransmitters (14Hempel C.M. Vincent P. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Selverston A.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For example, in lobster somatogastric neurons microinjected with fluorescently labeled tetrameric PKA, receptor-mediated cAMP gradients took many seconds to reach distant parts of the cell (14Hempel C.M. Vincent P. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Selverston A.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These differences are due to the different sensor speeds (see Figs. 1, D and E, and 2B), since transfecting hippocampal neurons with the tetrameric PKA sensor (12Zaccolo M. De Giorgi F. Cho C.Y. Feng L. Knapp T. Negulescu P.A. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 15Zaccolo M. Pozzan T. Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) revealed a speed of cAMP propagation (even at 1 μm isoprenaline, Fig. 3C) that was ≈20-fold slower than that recorded with Epac1-camps (Fig. 3D). The speed of cAMP propagation measured with Epac1-camps corresponds well with that estimated for cAMP using patch-clamp recording of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (270 μm2/s) (25Chen C. Nakamura T. Koutalos Y. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2861-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and with the diffusion coefficients calculated for cGMP (500 μm2/s) (26Olson A. Pugh Jr., E.N. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1335-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and microinjected cAMP (780 μm2/s) (13Bacskai B.J. Hochner B. Mahaut-Smith M. Adams S.R. Kaang B.K. Kandel E.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1993; 260: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Our initial aim was to develop a novel cAMP fluorescent indicator, lacking catalytic activity and cooperative binding typical for PKA and containing only one ligand-binding moiety fused to both GFP variants to provide a robust monomolecular change in FRET in response to elevating intracellular cAMP. Having four binding sites with different affinities the tetrameric PKA-based indicator demonstrated relatively slow activation kinetics (Figs. 1, D and E, 2B, and 3, C and D), reflecting subunit dissociation. In contrast, the new indicators presented in this paper are based on a single binding domain and reveal a fast speed of activation and are, therefore, more suitable for measuring cAMP with high temporal resolution. Taking only one binding domain of different cAMP-binding proteins made it possible to achieve not only a higher temporal resolution but also an equal level of YFP/CFP expression. Short cAMP-binding sequences in our indicators do not contain any catalytic or targeting domains that might interfere with intracellular regulatory processes. Transfected cells demonstrated uniform, stably reproducible, and rapid cAMP signals following agonist stimulation. Using constructs based on different cAMP-binding proteins in our imaging (Fig. 2E) and fluorometric experiments (Fig. 2D), we show that all three, Epac1, Epac2, and PKA regulatory subunit, seem to have a common mechanism of ligand-induced rearrangement in the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain suggesting a high functional homology. The fluorescent indicator allowed us to gain insight into the spatio-temporal organization of cAMP signaling in cells. The present study demonstrates rapid gradients of cAMP, propagating from the site of receptor activation through the whole living cell on the scale of a few hundred milliseconds, which is much faster than described previously for cells stimulated with neurotransmitters (14Hempel C.M. Vincent P. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Selverston A.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). cAMP signals recorded with Epac1-camps were uniformly distributed throughout hippocampal neurons, whereas PKA-mediated signals such as β-adrenergic stimulation of L-type calcium channels have been reported to be locally restricted due to formation of signaling complexes including receptors, G-proteins, adenylyl cyclases, effectors, and phosphatases (23Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The tetrameric PKA sensor used in cardiomyocytes (15Zaccolo M. Pozzan T. Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) is spatially restricted by binding to protein kinase A anchoring proteins, whereas Epac-camps (and the analogous sensors) appears to be uniformly distributed throughout the cytosol and to provide a novel sensitive method to image free cAMP concentrations in living cells. Interestingly, the speed of cAMP signals we measured in primary neurons or macrophages (Fig. 3, A and B) was remarkably higher than that in CHO or HEK293 cells (Fig. 2). This fact demonstrates that it is particularly important to study rapid signaling events in more physiological systems to fully understand their spatio-temporal properties. On the other hand, such physiological systems allow us to further study kinetic differences between distinct cAMP signaling pathways. Here we show that Epac signals are faster than PKA signals, suggesting that Epac may be a cAMP target physiologically developed to regulate more rapid receptor-mediated intracellular events. The binding domain of Epac, which is highly expressed in many different tissues (10Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 27Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), provides an excellent backbone for fluorescent probes to monitor the dynamics of cAMP in neurons and other cells. Epac-based fluorescent indicators presented here are capable of measuring cAMP in the physiological range with high temporal and spatial resolution and could therefore be ubiquitously applied to study regulation and biological function of cAMP in living cells.

https://openalex.org/W1979162495,"Protein microarrays provide a powerful tool for the study of protein function. However, they are not widely used, in part because of the challenges in producing proteins to spot on the arrays. We generated protein microarrays by printing complementary DNAs onto glass slides and then translating target proteins with mammalian reticulocyte lysate. Epitope tags fused to the proteins allowed them to be immobilized in situ. This obviated the need to purify proteins, avoided protein stability problems during storage, and captured sufficient protein for functional studies. We used the technology to map pairwise interactions among 29 human DNA replication initiation proteins, recapitulate the regulation of Cdt1 binding to select replication proteins, and map its geminin-binding domain."

When planted into native habitats, lipoxygenase-deficient plants were more vulnerable to N. attenuata 's adapted herbivores but also attracted novel herbivore species, which fed and reproduced successfully. In addition to highlighting the value of genetically silencing plants to study ecological interactions in nature, these results show that lipoxygenase-dependent signaling determines host selection for opportunistic herbivores and that induced defenses influence herbivore community composition."

We have developed a method to quantify intermediate-range order in 3.4-nanometer-diameter zinc sulfide nanoparticles and show that structural coherence is lost over distances beyond 2nanometers. The zinc-sulfur Einstein vibration frequency in the nanoparticles is substantially higher than that in the bulk zinc sulfide, implying structural stiffening. This cannot be explained by the observed 1% radial compression and must be primarily due to inhomogeneous internal strain caused by competing relaxations from an irregular surface. The methods developed here are generally applicable to the characterization of nanoscale solids, many of which may exhibit complex disorder and strain."
https://openalex.org/W1965949837,"Biological membrane fusion is crucial to numerous cellular events, including sexual reproduction and exocytosis. Here, mass spectrometry images demonstrate that the low-curvature lipid phosphatidylcholine is diminished in the membrane regions between fusing Tetrahymena , where a multitude of highly curved fusion pores exist. Additionally, mass spectra and principal component analysis indicate that the fusion region contains elevated amounts of 2-aminoethylphosphonolipid, a high-curvature lipid. This evidence suggests that biological fusion involves and might in fact be driven by a heterogeneous redistribution of lipids at the fusion site."
https://openalex.org/W2098199598,"Pulmonary surfactant, the lipid-protein material that stabilizes the respiratory surface of the lungs, contains approximately equimolar amounts of saturated and unsaturated phospholipid species and significant proportions of cholesterol. Such lipid composition suggests that the membranes taking part in the surfactant structures could be organized heterogeneously in the form of inplane domains, originating from particular distributions of specific proteins and lipids. Here we report novel results concerning the lateral organization of bilayer membranes made of <i>native</i> pulmonary surfactant where the coexistence of two distinct micrometer sized fluid phases (fluid ordered and fluid disordered-like phases) is observed at physiological temperatures by using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Additional experiments using fluorescent-labeled proteins SP-B and SP-C show that at physiological temperatures these hydrophobic proteins are located exclusively in the fluid disordered-like phase. Most interestingly, the microscopic coexistence of fluid phases is maintained up to 37.5 °C, where most fluid ordered phases melt. This observation suggests that the particular composition of this material is naturally designed to be at the ""edge"" of a lateral structure transition under physiological conditions, likely providing particular structural and dynamic properties for its mechanical function. The observed lateral structure in <i>native</i> pulmonary surfactant membranes is dramatically affected by the extraction of cholesterol, an effect not observed upon extraction of the surfactant proteins. Furthermore, the spreading properties of the native surfactant material at the air-liquid interface were also greatly affected by cholesterol extraction, suggesting a connection between the observed lateral structure and a physiologically relevant function of the material. We suggest that the particular lipid composition of surfactant could be finely tuned to provide, under physiological conditions, a structural scaffold for surfactant proteins to act at appropriate local densities and lipid composition."
https://openalex.org/W2171092661,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, which are abnormal protein deposits. The major constituent of the plaques is the neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta); the genetics of familial AD support a direct role for this peptide in AD. Abeta neurotoxicity is linked to hydrogen peroxide formation. Abeta coordinates the redox active transition metals, copper and iron, to catalytically generate reactive oxygen species. The chemical mechanism underlying this process is not well defined. With the use of density functional theory calculations to delineate the chemical mechanisms that drive the catalytic production of H2O2 by Abeta/Cu, tyrosine10 (Y10) was identified as a pivotal residue for this reaction to proceed. The relative stability of tyrosyl radicals facilitates the electron transfers that are required to drive the reaction. Confirming the theoretical results, mutation of the tyrosine residue to alanine inhibited H2O2 production, Cu-induced radicalization, dityrosine cross-linking, and neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2077081790,"Dendritic valleys on the plateau and canyons of the Valles Marineris region were identified from Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) images taken by Mars Odyssey. The geomorphic characteristics of these valleys, especially their high degree of branching, favor formation by atmospheric precipitation. The presence of inner channels and the maturity of the branched networks indicate sustained fluid flows over geologically long periods of time. These fluvial landforms occur within the Late Hesperian units (about 2.9 to 3.4 billion years old), when Mars was thought to have been cold. Our results suggest a period of warmer conditions conducive to hydrological activity."

We observed polarization-selective transmission in chiral fibers with pitches of tens of micrometers. Two modes of optical interaction were differentiated. In chirallong-period gratings, dips in transmission were observed at wavelengths associated with scattering into distinct cladding modes mediated by the chiral grating. In chiral intermediateperiod gratings, a broad scattering band was observed. These gratings can be used to produce sharp or broad polarization-selective filters."
https://openalex.org/W1984893961,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase is a multifunctional heme-dependent enzyme that activates the core anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid. Numerous studies have been undertaken to elucidate the enzyme-dependent mechanism of isoniazid activation, and it is well documented that mutations that reduce activity or inactivate the catalase-peroxidase lead to increased levels of isoniazid resistance in M. tuberculosis. Interpretation of the catalytic activities and the effects of mutations upon the action of the enzyme to date have been limited due to the lack of a three-dimensional structure for this enzyme. In order to provide a more accurate model of the three-dimensional structure of the M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase, we have crystallized the enzyme and now report its crystal structure refined to 2.4-Å resolution. The structure reveals new information about dimer assembly and provides information about the location of residues that may play a role in catalysis including candidates for protein-based radical formation.

Catalase-peroxidases (CPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CP, catalase-peroxidase; CcP, cytochrome c peroxidase; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazide (isoniazid); mtCP, M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase; HRPC, horseradish peroxidase C; bpCP, B. pseudomallei catalase-peroxidase; hmCP, H. marismortui catalase-peroxidase.1The abbreviations used are: CP, catalase-peroxidase; CcP, cytochrome c peroxidase; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazide (isoniazid); mtCP, M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase; HRPC, horseradish peroxidase C; bpCP, B. pseudomallei catalase-peroxidase; hmCP, H. marismortui catalase-peroxidase. are bi-functional, heme-dependent enzymes that exhibit a strong catalatic activity comparable with that of monofunctional catalases and a broad-spectrum peroxidatic activity. The proposed role of the enzyme is to protect bacteria from toxic molecules including hydroperoxides and hydroxyl radicals that are present in an aerobic environment. CPs are generally homodimers or homotetramers with subunits of about 80 kDa. The single polypeptide chain containing two domains, each of ∼40 kDa, is proposed to have arisen from a gene duplication event (1Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis shows that the N-terminal domain contains a heme binding motif, whereas the C-terminal domain lacks this feature. Despite the strong catalatic activity displayed by CPs, the sequence shows no homology with catalases. However, both CP domains show highest sequence similarity with yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and CPs are, therefore, classified as belonging to class I of the superfamily of plant, fungal, and bacterial peroxidases (2Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The Mycobacterium tuberculosis CP has been the subject of numerous studies because of its ability to activate isoniazid (INH), a core compound used to treat tuberculosis. In particular, it has long been observed that INH resistance in tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria has often been correlated with reduced levels of catalase activity (3Middlebrook G. Cohn M.L. Schaefer W.B. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1954; 70: 852-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Youatt J. Tham S.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1969; 100: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar, 5Youatt J. Tham S.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1969; 100: 77-78PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was confirmed that the presence of an active CP, encoded by a single gene, katG, is sufficient to confer INH sensitivity in M. tuberculosis, the organism principally responsible for tuberculosis (6Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Studies using M. tuberculosis CP obtained either from the organism or in a recombinant form demonstrated that the enzyme is capable of oxidizing INH (7Shoeb H.A. Bowman Jr., B.U. Ottolenghi A.C. Merola A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Johnsson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of oxidation and the precise mode of action of the drug are still subjects for debate. Of the evidence to date, there is some indication that activated INH may inhibit the action of InhA (9Dessen A. Quemard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and KasA (10Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), enzymes that are proposed to be involved in the synthesis of mycolic acids. In vitro assays have demonstrated that inactivation of the InhA enzyme by INH only occurs in the presence of NADH or NAD+ (11Quemard A. Dessen A. Sugantino M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Blanchard J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1561-1562Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of InhA containing an INH-NADH adduct present in its active site has been determined (12Rozwarski D.A. Grant G.A. Barton D.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Recently published data have also shown that an INH-NADH adduct is an effective inhibitor of InhA (13Rawat R. Whitty A. Tonge P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13881-13886Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is established that in vitro activation of INH by M. tuberculosis CP yields acid, amide, and aldehyde products (8Johnsson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 14Bodiguel J. Nagy J.M. Brown K.A. Jamart-Gregoire B. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8867-8870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Generation of the amide product has been shown to proceed via the cleavage of a C-N bond (14Bodiguel J. Nagy J.M. Brown K.A. Jamart-Gregoire B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3832-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is thought to yield an acyl radical (8Johnsson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am.

Soc. 2001; 123: 3832-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that is capable of reacting with NADH or NAD+, for example. Residues and other structural elements that play a key role in the enzyme-mediated activation of INH by M. tuberculosis CP have yet to be definitively assigned. Identification of the binding site for INH in the enzyme is still open to question and is of fundamental importance in understanding both the activation process of the drug and the significance of mutations in the enzyme, which may be directly responsible for INH resistance. As a key step toward elucidating the functions of M. tuberculosis CP and in particular its role in INH activation, we have determined the crystal structure of a recombinant form of M. tuberculosis CP (mtCP) to 2.4-Å resolution. We discuss how main-chain and side-chain features relate to the assembly and function of the enzyme. Comparative analyses of sequences and structures of related class I and class III peroxidases predict that the binding site for INH in mtCP will be near the δ-meso edge of the heme rather than in a surface loop as currently proposed by others (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Computational analyses of interaction sites for INH in combination with the availability of an NMR-derived model of a complex between horseradish peroxidase C (HRPC) and INH (17Pierattelli R. Banci L. Eady N.A.J. Bodiguel J. Jones J.N. Moody P.C.E. Raven E.L. Jamart-Gregoire B. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39000-39009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have enabled us to model the location of the drug within the active site of mtCP. The significance of the identification of this binding site is discussed in the context of the interpretation of radical sites and mutations related to INH resistance in clinical isolates. Protein Overproduction and Purification—mtCP was purified from Escherichia coli strain UM255 (18Mulvey M.R. Sorby P.A. Triggs-Raine B.L. Loewen P.C. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) transformed with the pTrc99A derivative, pTBCP, using a modified version of a previously reported protocol (19Nagy J.M. Cass A.E. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31265-31271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To maximize heme incorporation, excess hemin was added to the crude cell extract before sonication. Briefly, hemin chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 ml of Milli-Q water to a final concentration of 24.5 mm. The addition of 1 μl of 10 m NaOH was sufficient to dissolve the hemin chloride, yielding a final solution at about pH 6.0. Reconstituted holoenzyme was achieved by adding the hemin solution in a 1:25 (v/v) ratio to the cell pellet of 1 liter of culture resuspended in 10-15 ml of 100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 6.5) at 4 °C. The suspension was mixed well by vortexing and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min before sonication. Cells were lysed by sonication with 3 × 30-s bursts on power level 8 using a microtip and an XL2020 sonicator (Labcaire Systems, Clevedon, UK). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 50 min. The supernatant was treated with 100 μg/ml DNase and 10 μg/ml RNase for 1 h at 4 °C and then recentrifuged as just described. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (19Nagy J.M. Cass A.E. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31265-31271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pooled, active fractions were passed through a Millipore 0.45-μm filter and loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto an Amersham Biosciences HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (120 ml) gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 m KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer, 0.0027 m KCl, 0.137 m NaCl (pH 7.5)) overnight. 1.0-ml fractions were collected, assayed, and pooled (19Nagy J.M. Cass A.E. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31265-31271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pooled, active fractions were then loaded at 2.0 ml/min onto an Amersham Biosciences Resource Q (6 ml) anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with 30 ml of 100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 6.5). The column was washed with 12 ml of 100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 6.5), and mtCP was eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient of 0-1.0 m NaCl in 100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 6.5) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. 1.0-ml fractions were collected, assayed, and pooled. An Amersham Biosciences HiTrap Desalt column was used to remove NaCl and change buffer conditions for crystallization studies. The column was equilibrated with 25 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 7.0) using a syringe. mtCP was loaded onto the column in 1.5-ml aliquots and eluted with 2 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 7.0). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of mtCP were obtained by the vapor diffusion, hanging-drop method with 2 μl of a 22-mg/ml protein solution and 2 μl of the reservoir solution, which contained 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6). After 24 h at 20 °C, red-brown plate-like crystals were visible. A single crystal was placed in a cryo-buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen cryo-stream. Diffraction data were collected on beamline 14.1 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury, UK using an Area Detector System Corp. Quantum-4 CCD detector and a wavelength of 1.488 Å. Structure Solution, Refinement, and Superpositions—The diffraction data were processed using the program DENZO and scaled with program SCALEPACK (20Otwinoski Z. Minor W. DENZO, a Film Processing Program for Macromolecular Crystallography. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A portion of the data set (10%) was flagged for the calculation of Rfree and excluded from subsequent refinement. The structure of mtCP was solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of the Burkholderia pseudomallei CP (bpCP) (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C.

Simulated annealing was initially used as well as non-crystallographic restraints. The two molecules of the asymmetric unit were refined as different models using individual B factors. In the final steps solvent molecules were placed in residue density above 2.5 S.D. and with at least one hydrogen bond with the refined model. Water molecules with a B factor higher than 60 Å2 were discarded. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (www.pymol.org; Ref. 24DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar) and were based upon Cα coordinates in all these structures. INH was docked into the active site of mtCP based upon a superposition of the mtCP crystal structure with the HRPC·INH NMR-derived model (17Pierattelli R. Banci L. Eady N.A.J. Bodiguel J. Jones J.N.

GRID Calculations—GRID, a computational program by P. J. Goodford (30Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar), was designed to detect energetically favorable binding sites on proteins, structurally determined by x-ray crystallography or NMR, with the view that this information could be used in the rational design of drugs. In GRID, the target molecule is the species being evaluated, and the probe molecule is a small biologically active species such as water, amine nitrogen, carboxyl oxygen, or hydroxyl. GRID calculates the interaction energies between the probe molecule and the target molecule accounting for both the shape and energy of the two species. Analysis of GRID data yields three-dimensional maps that can be contoured to identify the location of energetically favorable interaction sites. GRID calculations (30Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar) were performed on atomic coordinate files of the crystal structures of mtCP, bpCP (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S.

Missing residues were added in idealized positions based on the position of surrounding residues by Swiss PDB Viewer (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar), and the structures were minimized using CNSsolve (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The atomic coordinate files were prepared for use in GRID using the program GRIN. The total charge of each structure was determined in GRIN, and appropriate counterions (Na+ or Cl-) were placed near charged residues with care taken to avoid the channel region near the heme. Four GRID probes, NH, NH2, carbonyl oxygen, and aromatic neutral amide, were selected to model the functional groups of INH. The move directive in GRID was set to -1 to allow the counterions to move in response to the probe. All GRID calculations were performed on the charge-balanced protein coordinate files at a resolution of 0.5 Å. The output data generated by GRID were read into MSI Insight II (Accelrys, Cambridge, UK) software version 2000 for visualization of the energy maps. The GRID maps were converted into ASCII files using MSI Insight II and read into DS ViewerPro (Accelrys, Cambridge, UK) for visualization and figure preparation. Fold and Assembly of the M. tuberculosis CP—The mtCP crystal structure was determined to a resolution of 2.4 Å, with Rcryst and Rfree values of 21.1 and 26.8%, respectively. Full data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The mtCP crystal structure shows that the enzyme assembles as a functional homodimer. The electron density map of each monomer includes residues 24-740 of the polypeptide chain, one heme b moiety, and three glycerol molecules. In addition 703 water molecules associated with the homodimer were also identified and refined. Each monomer (Fig. 1) is composed of two domains that are mainly α-helical and display a common core structure shared by members of the bacterial and plant peroxidase families including CcP (26Wang J.M.

Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of mtCP contains the active site of the enzyme, which includes the heme b prosthetic group. The fold of the C-terminal domain of mtCP is similar to that of the N-terminal domain, consistent with the proposal that the enzyme arose from a gene duplication event (1Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). No heme is observed in this domain, which is also consistent with the observation that the C-terminal domain lacks signature sequences, indicative of a heme binding site (2Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of mtCP shows that the enzyme adopts a similar fold to those reported for the crystal structures of hmCP (31Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and bpCP (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). mtCP shares 55% identity and 69% similarity with hmCP and 66% identity and 77% similarity with bpCP. Cα backbone superpositions show root mean square deviations of 1.18 and 0.82 Å between mtCP with hmCP or bpCP, respectively. Active site residues are conserved and align well in all three structures, and there are few structural differences in the three-dimensional arrangement of the polypeptide chains. The most significant difference is at the N terminus of mtCP; although electron density is lacking for the first 23 residues, extra residues are visible (residues 24-30, highlighted in Fig. 1) in comparison with the hmCP (31Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and bpCP (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) crystal structures (7 more than bpCP and 6 more than hmCP). The implications of this extra visible region in homodimer assembly are discussed below. Fig. 1 also highlights a surface loop region (residues 278-312 in mtCP), which is present in similar conformations in all three CP crystal structures. In bpCP this loop region has been proposed to form a substrate binding site where INH could interact with the enzyme (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although as discussed below, data presented here and in Pierattelli et al. (17Pierattelli R. Banci L. Eady N.A.J. Bodiguel J.

The observation of a homodimer in the crystal structure of mtCP (Fig. 2A) agrees well with gel filtration (19Nagy J.M. Cass A.E. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31265-31271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol.

Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 617Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which demonstrate that this enzyme is a dimer in solution. Inspection of the crystal structure of mtCP suggests that the most important inter-domain interactions are between the N- and C-terminal domains of the two monomers that form the functional homodimer. The lack of electron density for the first 23 residues of mtCP suggests that there is conformational flexibility at the N terminus. However, there also appear to be significant inter-domain interactions between N-terminal residues of mtCP as was previously proposed using the yeast two-hybrid assay (35Wilming M. Johnsson K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and as was observed in the bpCP crystal structure (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The N-terminal residues appear to “hook” around each other in a manner that may further stabilize the formation of the dimer, shown schematically in Fig. 2B, a detail not previously observed in the hmCP (31Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or bpCP (16Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) crystal structures. This stabilization appears to be mediated by the presence of stacking interactions between Tyr-8 and Tyr-97 and between Trp-38 and Trp-204 from opposite monomers (Fig. 2C). This long N-terminal extension appears unique to the CPs and is not present in other members of the class I peroxidase family, e.g. CcP (26Wang J.M. Mauro M. Edwards S.L. Oatley S.J. Fishel L.A. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7160-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and APX (27Sharp K.H. Mewies M. Moody P.C. Raven E.L. Nat. Struct.

Hence, although inter-domain contacts between monomers of mtCP appear to be important in mediating homodimer formation, it is also interesting to note this hook motif may also play a sign"

Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most cell types express PGs and, often, the same cell type expresses more than one type of PG. PGs are present on the cell surface of most cells, and it is now established that cell surface PGs have an essential role in acting as co-receptors for various growth factors (3Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 4Lander A.D. Matrix Biology. 1999; 17: 465-472Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Park P.W.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and basement membranes (8Timpl R. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, they can be found intracellularly (9Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Pejler G. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PGs have emerged from being considered as relatively inert structural components of connective tissue into the center stage of biology, having an enormous impact on a wide array of biological processes. Particular progress in understanding the function of this group of molecules has arisen from gene targeting studies. In such studies the strategies can be divided into two major directions: (i) targeting of the gene coding for a PG core protein or (ii) targeting of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the GAG side chains (reviewed in Ref. 10Forsberg E. Kjellen L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, in previous studies the biological functions of heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin GAGs have been approached by targeting the genes for different enzymes involved in HS/heparin biosynthesis, i.e. EXT-1 (an HS polymerase (11Lin X.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Remarkably, although many studies have addressed the biological function of the various cell surface PGs and the extracellular PGs, the intracellular PGs have so far received less attention. PGs that are found inside cells can either be “part time” intracellular PGs, i.e. being present in the intracellular space (e.g. during uptake or secretion processes) or be destined for an intracellular compartment, i.e. being a “committed” intracellular PG. The committed intracellular PGs are predominantly found in the secretory granule of hematopoietic cells such as mast cells (MCs), cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets where they have an important function in binding to various secretory granule compounds, thus facilitating their storage (12Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The PGs found in hematopoietic cell types are generally thought to be of serglycin (SG) type. Indeed, cDNAs encoding the SG core protein have been cloned from MCs (27Kjellén L. Pettersson I. Lillhager P. Steen M.L. Pettersson U. Lehtonen P. Karlsson T. Ruoslahti E. Hellman L. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Stevens R.L. Avraham S. Gartner M.C. Bruns G.A. Austen K.F. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7287-7291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SG mRNA has been detected in a variety of other hematopoietic cell lineages (reviewed in Ref. 9Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Pejler G. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, SG expression has been reported in nonhematopoietic cell types, such as endothelial cells (29Schick B.P. Gradowski J.F. San Antonio J.D. Blood. 2001; 97: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and pancreatic acinar cells (30Biederbick A. Licht A. Kleene R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as well as in ES cells (31Schick B.P. Ho H.C. Brodbeck K.C. Wrigley C.W. Klimas J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the core protein of PGs in secretory granules of hematopoietic cells may be the same, the GAG chain moieties of the PGs differ markedly between different cell types and can also differ between subtypes of SG-containing cells. In connective tissue-type MCs, the GAG side chains are predominantly of heparin type, having a [GlcUA/IdoUA-GlcNAc]n carbohydrate backbone structure with most of the GlcNAc units being N-sulfated. In addition, the GlcUA/IdoUA units may carry 2-O- sulfate groups, and the GlcNAc units can be O-sulfated, at the 6- and 3-positions (32Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the connective tissue-type MC is the only cell type that has the capability to synthesize the highly sulfated GAG that is denoted “heparin,” whereas a multitude of other cells synthesize HS, i.e. lower sulfated species of the same general structure. Most interestingly, whereas the connective tissue-type MCs predominantly synthesize GAG chains of heparin type, the mucosal MC subtype synthesizes mainly chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains (33Enerbäck L. Kolset S.O. Kusche M. Hjerpe A. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CS chains have a [GlcUA-GalNAc]n backbone structure carrying O-sulfate groups at the 4- and/or 6-position of the amino sugar (34Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that it is the 4- and 6-sulfated variant (oversulfated CS; CS-E) that dominates in MCs (33Enerbäck L. Kolset S.O. Kusche M. Hjerpe A. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Katz H.R. Austen K.F. Caterson B. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 7229-7236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cell types other than MCs, lower sulfated GAG species of CS type are predominantly attached to the secretory granule PG core proteins (9Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Pejler G. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the biological function of the committed intracellular PGs, here we have targeted the gene for SG by homologous recombination in ES cells and generated SG-/- mice. We show that SG has a crucial role in the formation of mature MC secretory granules. Reagents—The chromogenic peptide substrates S-2586 and S-2288 were from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). The CPA substrate M-2245 (N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH) was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Germany). Donkey anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Antisera toward recombinant CPA, mMCP-5, and mMCP-6 were raised in rabbits. The antiserum toward mMCP-4 was a gift from Lars Hellman (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden). Gene Targeting and Construct Design—A complete genomic DNA sequence contig covering the SG gene was extracted from the Ensembl data base (Sanger Institute). Based on the corresponding SG cDNA sequence, exons 1–3 were identified in the genomic DNA sequence. The SG gene is spanning over ∼15 kb including regulatory sequences (48Schick B.P. Petrushina I. Brodbeck K.C. Castronuevo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24726-24735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We decided to make a classical knockout by replacing exon 1 and the regulatory sequences with a neomycin-resistant cassette. A PCR-based strategy was employed by using a PCR enzyme with proofreading (LA-PCR, Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan). We amplified a 3.3-kb upstream targeting arm starting at 3,800 bp and ending 500 bp upstream of the start site (fragment A, forward primer 5′-GAC TCG AGT GAG GTT GGA TTA TGA AGT CTA AAC AGG G-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAC TCG AGA ATT CCT GGC TTT CCC TCT AGC TCA CAA AC-3′; the additional restriction sites are indicated in boldface) and a 4.3-kb downstream targeting arm located in intron 1 at 200 bp downstream of exon 1 (fragment C, forward primer 5′-GCG GAT CCA AGC TTG TCA GGA TGA CTG AAA AGT GTT C-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATC TCG AGC GGC CGC CAG AGA GAG GGT CGT TAT TGG-3′). The downstream arm, fragment C, was cloned into the BamHI and NotI site of the pNeomycin vector, and the A fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and SmaI site (modifying the XhoI site for blunt end cloning) of a loxP carrying vector. The C + neomycin cassette and the A + loxP fragments were released by NotI and ClaI from their respective vectors and cloned into the NotI site of the pZero-vector (Invitrogen). The final target construct, thus deleting the first exon and the promoter region of the SG gene, was released by NotI and used for homologous recombination in GSI-1 ES cells (Genome Systems Inc., St Louis, MO) at 1.5 μg of vector/106 cells. Almost 400 clones were obtained and frozen individually. The remaining cells were expanded, and DNA was extracted from all clones and pooled together (10 by 10) and screened for homologous recombination by long range PCR (LA-Taq, Takara). After initial screening of pooled material and a second individual screen by long range PCR using primers I and II (primer I is outside the construct and forward, 5′-GGT CAG CCC CTA GAG ACA GCA ATG AAA AGG-3′; primer II is inside neomycin and reverse, 5′-GGG CCA GCT CAT TCC TCC CAC TCA TGA TCT-3′), a total of four clones were found positive for homologous recombination. Two clones were used for blastocyst injections, and in total six male chimeric mice were used for germ line transmission breeding of which four chimeras gave germ line transmission. Resulting agouti animals were tail-clipped and genotyped with long range PCR using primers I and II. Heterozygote animals were crossed to generate homozygous null animals. For the genotyping of the F1 offspring, we used a three primer-based PCR approach to be able to detect in one PCR all three possible genotypes present in the litter (forward primer, 5′-GTC TCT GTT TTC ACA TTC CAC GGC CC-3′, and wt reverse (promoter region of exon 1) 5′-GGC ACA AGC AGG GAA CAT TCC GAG C-3′ and primer II). In all experiments throughout this study, animals with a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6J and 129SVJ were used. To compensate for possible genetic variation in the F1 generation, littermates of all three genotypes were used. Peritoneal Cells—Peritoneal cells from littermates (males, 12–18 weeks old) of SG+/+,SG+/-, and SG-/- mice were collected by peritoneal washing with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Staining Protocols of Cells—Cells were collected onto object glasses by cytospin (700 rpm, 5 min). A standard procedure for May Grünwald/Giemsa staining was used. Briefly, cells were fixed in methanol (5 min) and then washed once in H2O, before staining in May Grünwald solution (15 min) followed by Giemsa (10 min), with washing steps between and after staining. The chloroacetate esterase assay was performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Sigma). Analysis of Protease Activities in Tissues and BMMCs—Ear extracts were obtained by the addition of 1 ml of PBS/2 m NaCl per ear, followed by homogenization using a PT1200 Polytron device (Kinematica AG, Littau-Lucerne, Switzerland). After homogenization, Triton X-100 was added to give a final concentration of 0.5%. Extracts were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min); the supernatants were recovered, and samples from the supernatants were used for activity measurements. Peritoneal cells and BMMCs were solubilized in lysis buffer (PBS/2 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100; 100 μl lysis buffer/1 × 106 cells). Ten μl of the peritoneal cell, BMMC, or ear extracts were mixed with 90 μl of H2O, followed by the addition of 20 μl of 1.8 mm solutions (in H2O) of chromogenic substrates for either chymotrypsin-like proteases (S-2586), trypsin-like proteases (S-2288), or CPA (M-2245). The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored with a Titertek Multiscan spectrophotometer (Flow Laboratories), and initial reaction velocities were determined with the Delta Soft 3 software. Western Blot Analysis—Samples of ear tissue extracts, solubilized peritoneal cells, or bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were mixed with 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples (30 μl) of these mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Proteins were subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, followed by blocking with 5% milk powder in PBS (1 h, room temperature). Next, the membranes were incubated with antisera, diluted 1:400–1:1000 in TBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, at 4 °C overnight. After washing the membranes extensively with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:5000 in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20). After 45 min of incubation at room temperature, the membranes were washed extensively with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Bone Marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs)—BMMCs were obtained by culturing femur and tibia bone marrow cells from SG+/+, SG+/-, and SG-/- littermates (males, 18 weeks old) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biotech Line AS), 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden), 2 mml-glutamine (SVA), and 50% WEHI-3B conditioned media (which contains IL-3) for 3 weeks. The cell cultures were maintained at a concentration of ∼0.5 × 106 cells/ml, and the medium was changed every 3rd day. After 3 weeks of culture more than 95% of the cells were MCs, as judged by metachromatic staining with toluidine blue. To induce further differentiation, SCF (PeproTech, London, UK) was added at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. Glycosaminoglycan Isolation and Analysis—30 × 106 BMMCs were biosynthetically labeled overnight with 0.32 mCi of carrier-free 35S-sulfate (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 300 × g (4 °C) and were solubilized (at 4 °C) by adding 1 ml of PBS, 2 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100. After 30 min of incubation, 35S-labeled macromolecules were purified as follows. The solubilisate was diluted with 20 volumes of H2O (to reduce the NaCl concentration to 0.1 m) and was then applied to 0.4 ml of DEAE-Sephacel columns, equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 8.0). After washing the column with 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 8.0), and 4 ml of 50 mm NaAc, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 4.0), the columns were eluted with 50 mm NaAc, 2 m NaCl (pH 5.5). Four fractions (1100 μl) were collected, and 2 μl of each fraction were analyzed for 35S radioactivity by scintillation counting. Fractions containing radioactive material were subjected to papain digestion. To 1100 μl of sample, 25 μl of 0.5 m cysteinium chloride, 25 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 56 units of papain (Sigma) was added. The mixtures were incubated for 18 h at 56 °C with constant shaking, and the papain reaction was stopped by heating the samples at 100 °C for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged (350 × g, 10 min, at room temperature), and the supernatants were desalted on PD-10 columns. Before loading the samples, the columns had been washed with 25 ml of H2O, loaded with 50 μg of pig mucosal heparin (gift from U. Lindahl, Uppsala University), and washed again with 15 ml of H2O. The samples, in a total volume of 2.5 ml, were applied to the columns and eluted with 3.5 ml of H2O. Desalted samples were concentrated to 500 μl using a speedvac device. Samples (10,000 cpm) of isolated 35S-labeled GAGs were mixed with 22.5 μl of 2 m LiCl, 0.5 mg of CS-A (Sigma), and 0.45 mg of pig mucosal heparin and were diluted with H2O to 1 ml. The samples were applied to a 1-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel, connected to a high pressure liquid chromatography system. Anion exchange chromatography was performed with a gradient of increasing concentration of LiCl, from 0.05 to 2 m, in 50 mm NaAc (pH 4.0), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and were analyzed for uronic acid content, using the carbazole assay, and for 35S radioactivity. For determination of CS content, samples (∼40,000 cpm) were treated with 0.05 units of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) in a total volume of 250 μl of 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.03 m NaAc, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated at 37 °C for 15 h. Samples were then analyzed by gel chromatography on columns (0.5 × 90 cm) of Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and were analyzed for 35S radioactivity. Northern Blot and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from peritoneal cells, ear tissue, and BMMCs was isolated by using Trizol solution (Invitrogen) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Samples, each containing ∼25 μg of total RNA, were separated on 1.0% agarose gels containing 0.2 m formaldehyde and then transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The RNA was subsequently fixated to the filter by UV cross-linking (125 mJ). Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 65 °C in 0.25 m PO4 and 7% SDS. Blots were washed four times for 15 min in excessive volumes of 0.02 m PO4 and 1% SDS and exposed on Kodak Biomax MS films with an intensifying screen to enhance the radioactive signal. α-32P-Labeled random-primed probes were generated using the Ready Prime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length cDNAs for mMCP-4 and mMCP-6 were used for hybridization. A mouse α-actin probe was used as a reference to equalize the amounts of RNA loaded in each lane. For RT-PCR, Superscript II (Invitrogen) and specific reverse primers were used to produce single-stranded cDNA for all MC-related proteases. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was used as a positive control for the RT-PCR. The following PCR primers were used: mMCP-1/forward, 5′-GAG GAT CCA TGC AGG CCC TAC TAT TCC TGA TG-3′, and mMCP-1/reverse, 5′-ATC TCG AGC TTG CCA TTT ATG ACT GTT TTA ATC C-3′ (750-bp product); mMCP-2/forward, 5′-GAG GAT CCA TGC AGG CCC TAC TAT TCC TGA TG-3′ (yielding a 750-bp product) or 5′-GTG ATG ACT GCT GCA CAC TG-3′ (595-bp product), and mMCP-2/reverse, 5′-CTT GAA GAG TCT GAC TCA GG-3′; mMCP-4/forward, 5′-GTA ATT CCT CTG CCT CGT CCT-3′, and mMCP-4/reverse, 5′-CCC AAG GGT TAT TAG AAG AGC TC-3′ (425-bp product); mMCP-5/forward, 5′-GAG GAT CCA TGA AGC CTG CAG CAG CCC TGA GG-3′, and mMCP-5/reverse, 5′-GAC TCG AGA TTC TCC CTC AAG ATC TTA TTG ATC C-3′ (780-bp product); mMCP-6/forward, 5′-GAG CGG CCG CAT GCT GAA GCG GCG GCT GCT GCT G-3′, and mMCP-6/reverse, 5′-GAC TCG AGG GAA TGC TCA GGG ACA TAG CGG TG-3′ (830-bp product); CPA/forward, 5′-ACA CAG GAT CGA ATG TGG AG-3′, and CPA/reverse, 5′-TAA TGC AGG ACT TCA TGA GC-3′ (650-bp product); SG/forward, 5′-GTC CGC TGC AAA CCG AAT GGC TTT-3′, and SG/reverse, 5′-GGG AGA CAG AGA CCG TCA CAT TCA T-3′ (380-bp product; SG1) or 5′-GAG GAA AGG GGT AAC AGG ATT CAA G-3′ (510-bp product; SG2). These primers were only used for the results presented in Fig. 1D. For RT-PCR analysis (Figs. 2C and 4D), the following primer combination was used: SG/forward (450-bp product), 5′-GAG GAT CCA TGC AGG TTC CCG TCG GCA GCA G-3′, and SG/reverse, 5′-ATC TCG AGT ATA ATA AAA TCG TCT TCT GGT TGG TCT TGG-3′; Hprt/forward, 5′-CTC GAA GTG TTG GAT ACA GG-3′, and Hprt/reverse, 5′-TGG CCT ATA GGC TCA TAG TG-3′ (360-bp product).Fig. 2Morphology and phenotype of peritoneal MCs.A, cytospin slides were prepared from SG+/+ and SG-/- peritoneal cells and were stained with May Grünwald/Giemsa. Colored arrows indicate the presence of macrophages (green), lymphocytes (black), and MCs (red), respectively. Note the absence of densely stained MCs in the SG-/- population and the presence in SG-/- populations of cells containing large empty vesicles. B, cytospin slides were also assayed for chloroacetate esterase activity, a chymase-dependent activity. In wt MCs strong staining was observed, and even empty vesicle-containing cells showed strong staining (left panel). For comparison, NDST-2-/- peritoneal cells were also analyzed (boxed center panel). A reduced but strong staining was observed, and both empty vesicle-containing and granulated MCs were stained in the NDST-2 knockout. In the right panel SG-/- cells are shown. Notably the empty vesicle-containing cells show no staining. As a negative control of the assay macrophages are shown (lower left and right panel). C, expression of c-Kit. c-Kit (CD117) antigen was detected by immunostaining of cytospin slides prepared from SG+/+ and SG-/- peritoneal cells, using a monoclonal antibody. No staining was observed when an isotype-matched control antibody was used (not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2034806941,"To understand how postmating isolation is connected to the normal process of species divergence and why hybrid male sterility is often the first sign of speciation, we analyzed the Odysseus ( OdsH ) gene of hybrid male sterility in Drosophila . We carried out expression analysis, transgenic study, and gene knockout. The combined evidence suggests that the sterility phenotype represents a novel manifestation of the gene function rather than the reduction or loss of the normal one. The gene knockout experiment identified the normal function of OdsH as a modest enhancement of sperm production in young males. The implication of a weak effect of OdsH on the normal phenotype but a strong influence on hybrid male sterility is discussed in light of Haldane's rule of postmating isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2046050098,"Species richness often peaks at intermediate productivity and decreases as resources become more or less abundant. The mechanisms that produce this pattern are not completely known, but several previous studies have suggested environmental heterogeneity as a cause. In experiments with evolving digital organisms and populations of fixed size, maximum species richness emerges at intermediate productivity, even in a spatially homogeneous environment, owing to frequency-dependent selection to exploit an influx of mixed resources. A diverse pool of limiting resources is sufficient to cause adaptive radiation, which is manifest by the origin and maintenance of phenotypically and phylogenetically distinct groups of organisms."

Here we describe an African fossil cranium constrained by 40Ar/39Ar analyses, magnetostratigraphy, and sedimentary features to 0.97 to 0.90 Ma, and stratigraphically associated with Acheulean handaxes. Although the cranium represents possibly the smallest adult or near-adult known between 1.7 and 0.5 Ma, it retains features observed in larger Homo erectus individuals, yet shows a distinct suite of traits indicative of wide population variation in the hominins of this period."
https://openalex.org/W2120495439,"Hematopoietic (Hem) and endothelial (End) lineages derive from a common progenitor cell, the hemangioblast: specifically, the human cord blood (CB) CD34+KDR+ cell fraction comprises primitive Hem and End cells, as well as hemangioblasts. In humans, the potential therapeutic role of Hem and End progenitors in ischemic heart disease is subject to intense investigation. Particularly, the contribution of these cells to angiogenesis and cardiomyogenesis in myocardial ischemia is not well established. In our studies, we induced myocardial infarct (MI) in the immunocompromised NOD-SCID mouse model, and monitored the effects of myocardial transplantation of human CB CD34+ cells on cardiac function. Specifically, we compared the therapeutic effect of unseparated CD34+ cells vs. PBS and mononuclear cells (MNCs); moreover, we compared the action of the CD34+KDR+ cell subfraction vs. the CD34+KDR- subset. CD34+ cells significantly improve cardiac function after MI, as compared with PBS/MNCs. Similar beneficial actions were obtained using a 2-log lower number of CD34+KDR+ cells, while the same number of CD34+KDR- cells did not have any effects. The beneficial effect of CD34+KDR+ cells may mostly be ascribed to their notable resistance to apoptosis and to their angiogenic action, since cardiomyogenesis was limited. Altogether, our results indicate that, within the CD34+ cell population, the CD34+KDR+ fraction is responsible for the improvement in cardiac hemodynamics and hence represents the candidate active CD34+ cell subset."
https://openalex.org/W2128203408,"Herein we report that crotamine, a small lysine- and cysteine-rich protein from the venom of the South American rattlesnake, can rapidly penetrate into different cell types and mouse blastocysts in vitro. In vivo crotamine strongly labels cells from mouse bone marrow and spleen and from peritoneal liquid, as shown by fluorescent confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Nuclear localization of crotamine was observed in both fixed and unfixed cells. In the cytoplasm, crotamine specifically associates with centrosomes and thus allows us to follow the process of centriole duplication and separation. In the nucleus, it binds to the chromosomes at S/G2 phase, when centrioles start dividing. Moreover, crotamine appears as a marker of actively proliferating cells, as shown by 5-BrdU cell-proliferation assay. Crotamine in the micromolar range proved nontoxic to any of the cell cultures tested and did not affect the pluripotency of ES cells or the development of mouse embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2029508272,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) plays an important role in development and cell differentiation, and homologues of EGF-R have been identified in a broad range of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. This work concerns the functional characterization of SER, the EGF-R-like molecule previously identified in the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni (Shoemaker, C. B., Ramachandran, H., Landa, A., dos Reis, M. G., and Stein, L. D. (1992) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 53, 17–32). Transactivation assays performed in epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells co-transfected with SER and a Ras-responsive reporter vector indicated that SER was able to trigger a Ras/ERK pathway in response to human epidermal growth factor (EGF). These results were confirmed in Xenopus oocytes showing that human EGF induced meiosis reinitiation characterized by germinal vesicle breakdown in SER-expressing oocytes. Germinal vesicle breakdown induced by EGF was dependent on receptor kinase activity and shown to be associated with phosphorylation of SER and of downstream ERK proteins. 125I-EGF binding experiments performed on SER-expressing oocytes revealed high affinity (2.9 × 10–9m) of the schistosome receptor for human EGF. Phosphorylation of the native SER protein present in S. mansoni membranes was also shown to occur upon binding of human EGF. These data demonstrate the ability of the SER schistosome receptor to be activated by vertebrate EGF ligands as well as to activate the classical ERK pathway downstream, indicating the conservation of EGF-R function in S. mansoni. Moreover, human EGF was shown to increase protein and DNA synthesis as well as protein phosphorylation in parasites, supporting the hypothesis that host EGF could regulate schistosome development. The possible role of SER as a receptor for host EGF peptides and its implication in host-parasite signaling and parasite development are discussed.

EGF-R was the first receptor tyrosine kinase to be cloned (1Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar), and its structure and activation pathways have been studied extensively. EGF-R represents the archetype of receptor tyrosine kinase with an extracellular ligand-binding part with two cysteine-rich repeats and an intracellular domain containing tyrosine kinase activity (2Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4580) Google Scholar). In mammals, four isoforms of EGF-R have been characterized (EGF-R/ErbB-1, HER2/ErbB-2, HER3/ErbB-3, and HER4/ErbB-4), and a number of different ligands, including epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like molecules, can selectively bind each isoform (3Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Ligand binding activates the receptor by inducing the formation of homo-heterodimers. Dimerization triggers trans-phosphorylation and subsequent autophosphorylation of receptor molecules on tyrosine residues that provide docking sites for diverse effector and adaptor proteins. These partners (Grb2/Sos, p85-PI3K, PLCγ, and JAK) are active in different signal transduction cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositol 3-kinase, antiapoptotic kinase Akt, and several transcriptional regulatory pathways (reviewed in Ref. 4Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 129-132Crossref Scopus (5535) Google Scholar). Different homodimer-heterodimer combinations formed by EGF-R family members drive a complex signaling network within the MAPK pathway. The ERK pathway is the most recurrent and is mainly responsible for the mitogenic action of EGF receptors. Dysregulation of EGF-R signaling is therefore strongly oncogenic, and the direct implication of EGF-R isoforms in various cancers has been widely demonstrated. For this reason, EGF-R currently represents one of the major drug targets in human cancer therapy (5Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).In invertebrates, EGF-R isoforms appeared to be expressed in more limited numbers. A single isoform has been characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans (LET-23) (6Aroian R.V. Koga M. Mendel J.E. Ohshima Y. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1990; 348: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) as well as in Drosophila melanogaster (DER) (7Livneh E. Glazer L. Segal D. Schlessinger J. Shilo B.Z. Cell. 1985; 40: 599-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Schejter E.D. Shilo B.Z. Cell. 1989; 56: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A single cognate ligand (LIN-3) would be present in the worm (9Hill R.J. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1992; 358: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and four distinct cognate ligands (Vein, Gurken, Spitz, and Argos) would be present in the fly (10Schweitzer R. Shilo B.Z. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that the EGF-R signaling module has grown in complexity from invertebrates to mammals. However, except for C. elegans and D. melanogaster models, few data are available at present about the role of the EGF-R family in invertebrate development.SER, the Schistosoma mansoni EGF-R homologue, is one of the three receptor tyrosine kinases that have been characterized in this trematode parasite (11Shoemaker C.B. Ramachandran H. Landa A. dos Reis M.G. Stein L.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Vicogne J. Pin J.P. Lardans V. Capron M. Noel C. Dissous C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SER is present predominantly in schistosome muscles, suggesting that it could participate in muscle development and functions (13Ramachandran H. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar to other EGF-R family members, the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain is the most highly conserved region, whereas the extracellular domain is poorly conserved. Previous work has shown that recombinant SER expressed in insect cells possessed kinase activity and was capable of autophosphorylation, but no evidence was given regarding its function in the parasite (13Ramachandran H. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we have undertaken a functional study of SER to analyze the signaling pathways triggered upon its activation and its potential role as a receptor for host ligands. The expression of the SER recombinant protein has been examined in two different vertebrate cellular systems (epithelial MDCK cells and Xenopus oocytes) to analyze the affinity of the parasite receptor for human EGF and its ability to phosphorylate and activate an ERK-dependent signaling pathway. SER analysis was extended to the different schistosome life stages, and the effect of human EGF on parasite metabolism was studied in vitro on sporocysts, the only proliferative stage that develops in the mollusc intermediate host. The possible role of SER as a receptor for host EGF peptides and its implication in host-parasite signaling and parasite development are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasites—A Puerto Rican strain of S. mansoni was maintained by passage through albino Biomphalaria glabrata snails and Mesocricetus auratus hamsters. Miracidia and cercariae were prepared as described previously (14Dissous C. Grzych J.M. Capron A. Nature. 1986; 323: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Miracidia were transformed in vitro into sporocysts by incubation in minimum salt medium at 28 °C for 18 h (15Schallig H. Shut A. Van der Knaap W. De Jong Brink M. Parasitol. Res. 1990; 76: 278-279Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Adult schistosomes were collected by portal perfusion from infected hamsters.Cloning of SER—Total RNA was isolated from S. mansoni adult worms by the method of Chirgwin et al. (16Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar) and purified by centrifugation through a cesium chloride gradient. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Thermoscript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) and the oligo(dT)20 primer. SERfwd (5′-AAAAGCTTTAAATGGATTTTTTACTACCTACTCTG-3′) and SERrev (5′-GCGGCCGCATAATTCCAGCGAGGATGACTCATTTTGG-3′) complementary to the N- and C-terminal sequences of the SER cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. M86396) were used as primers in RT-PCR to amplify the schistosome cDNA. PCR was carried out with Taq Platinum HiFi polymerase (Invitrogen). Final products were purified, cloned into TOPO 4.0 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and then inserted in-frame into the pcDNA3.1-V5/His expression vector (Invitrogen). SER-pcDNA3.1 constructs were sequenced using the Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and analyzed on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Dead kinase SER (SERTK–) constructs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the active D1202FG1204 motif into a DNA inactive motif using the QuikChange® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The 5′-CATGTACAGATTACTGATaaTGcTTAGCTAAAATGTTAG-3′ mutated sequence and its reverse complement were used as primers (mutated residues are lowercase italic).Transactivation Assays in MDCK Cells—Transactivation assays were performed as described previously, with minor modifications (17Fafeur V. Tulasne D. Queva C. Vercamer C. Dimster V. Mattot V. Stehelin D. Desbiens X. Vandenbunder B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104 MDCK cells were cultured in 12-well plates and transiently transfected using a lipofection method. Cells were rinsed and incubated in 500 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of SER-pcDNA3.1 or empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid DNA (as a control), 0.25 μg of Py-Luc reporter vector (18Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of LipofectAMINE. Twenty-four hours later, cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations (up to 30 nm) of recombinant human EGF. After 24 h of incubation, cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (Promega) and centrifuged. Cell supernatants were processed in triplicates for luciferase assays. Results are expressed in relative luciferase units, considering the value obtained in control cells without EGF as a unit. Three experiments were performed with independent plasmid preparations to assess reproducibility.cRNA in Vitro Synthesis—Capped mRNA (cRNA) was synthesized using the T7 mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion). SER and SERTK–-pcDNA3.1 plasmids were linearized by the enzyme PmeI, and pOBER plasmid (19Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) containing the human EGF-R (HER) was digested by NotI. cRNAs transcribed from 1 μg of each linearized plasmid were precipitated by 2.5 m LiCl, washed in 70% ethanol, resuspended in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and then quantified by spectrophotometry. Finally, 1 μg of cRNA was analyzed on a denaturating agarose gel. Gel staining with 10 μg ml–1 ethidium bromide allowed confirmation of the size of cRNA and verification of the absence of abortive transcripts.Expression of SER in Xenopus Oocytes—After anesthesia with MS 222 (1g l–1; Sandoz), Xenopus laevis ovarian fragments were surgically removed and placed in ND96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm Hepes adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin (50 μg ml–1 each; Eurobio), sodium pyruvate (225 μg ml–1; Sigma), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 μg ml–1; Sigma). Stage VI oocytes were harvested after a 1-h treatment with 1 mg ml–1 collagenase A (Roche Applied Science). Complete defolliculation of oocytes was achieved by manual dissection. Oocytes were kept at 19 °C in ND96 medium before microinjection in the equatorial region. In each assay, 20–30 oocytes removed from at least two different animals were used. 60 nl (equivalent to 60 ng) of SER, SERTK–, and HER cRNA were injected in each oocyte 48 h before stimulation by recombinant human EGF (R&D Systems). GVBD was detected by the appearance of a white spot at the center of the animal pole after 15 h of human EGF treatment. Student's t test was used to assess the significance of the observed differences.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses of SER Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—Expression of SER in oocytes was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of membrane extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled oocytes according to the procedure described previously (20Cailliau K. Le Marcis V. Béréziat V. Perdereau D. Cariou B. Vilain J.P. Burnol A.F. Browaeys-Poly E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with SER or SERTK–, incubated in ND96 medium containing [35S]methionine (3000 Ci mmol–1, 0.5 mCi ml–1) for 48 h, lysed in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% SDS, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 10 μg ml–1 aprotinin, 10 μg ml–1 soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg ml–1 benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate), and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Membrane pellets were resuspended and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and then centrifuged under the same conditions. Supernatants were incubated with anti-V5 antibodies (1:100; Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (5 mg; Amersham Biosciences) were added for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, rinsed three times, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. The detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated SER proteins was performed in oocytes expressing SER or SERTK– for 48 h and stimulated or not for 5 min by EGF (49.8 nm, final concentration). Briefly, 30 oocytes were lysed in 300 μl of buffer A, and membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated by anti-V5 antibodies under the same conditions as described above. Immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-V5 (1:50,000) and PY20 (1:10,000; BD Biosciences) antibodies and the ECL advance detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).The detection of ERK proteins in oocyte homogenates was performed by Western blotting using anti-ERK2 mouse antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (21Browaeys-Poly E. Cailliau K. Vilain J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).EGF Binding Analysis—Oocytes were injected with 60 nl of SER cRNA (equivalent to 60 ng) or with 60 nl of water 48 h before EGF binding assays. Sets of 10 oocytes were placed in 24-well plates and preincubated in ND96 medium and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 0 °C. A 10–7m human EGF solution containing 125I-labeled human EGF (250 μCi ml–1; specific activity, 1266 Ci mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences) was prepared, and serial dilutions of the radioactive mixture were made in ND96 medium/bovine serum albumin. Oocyte groups were incubated for 4 h (until equilibrium) at 0 °C in a total volume of 200 μl in the presence of 10–8, 6.6 × 10–9, 3.3 × 10–9, 10–9, and 5 × 10–10 m EGF final concentrations. At the end of the incubation, aliquots of media were removed and used to determine the amount of free radioactivity in each well. Oocytes were washed three times in cold ND96 medium/bovine serum albumin buffer, and the radioactivity bound to oocytes was determined. Nonspecific binding to water-injected oocytes represented <10% of total binding and was deducted from the values of bound radioactivity. Scatchard analysis was performed using EnzFitter software (Biosoft). The experiment was repeated twice using oocytes removed from two different animals. In each experiment, the efficacy of oocyte transfection and SER expression was confirmed after GVBD induction upon EGF stimulation.Detection of Phosphorylated SER Protein in Schistosome Membrane Extracts—S. mansoni adult worms freshly perfused from infected hamsters were homogeneized in PY buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Membrane pellets equivalent to 100 parasites were resuspended in 1 ml of PY buffer with or without 1 μm EGF and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, membrane pellets were homogeneized in 100 μlof PY supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. Membrane lysates were complemented with 4 volumes of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm Nacl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 50 μm ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before immunoprecipitation by purified rabbit anti-SER antibodies directed against the ligand binding domain (residues 357–517) of the receptor (1 μg ml–1; kindly provided by P. Skelly; Ref. 13Ramachandran H. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were analyzed in 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and revealed by Western blotting using anti-PY20 (1:10,000; BD Biosciences).Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from miracidia, sporocysts, cercariae, and adult male and female worms using the technique of Chirgwin et al. (16Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar) and then reverse-transcribed using the Thermoscript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). cDNAs were used as templates for PCR amplification using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix and the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers specific for S. mansoni tubulin (GenBank™ accession no. 80214, positions 851–873 and 925–904) and SER (GenBank™ accession no. M86396, positions 1002–1022 and 1102–1081) were designed by the Primer Express Program (Applied Biosystems) and used for amplification in triplicate assays. For graphical representation of quantitative PCR data, raw cycle threshold values (Ct values) obtained for male worms, female worms, miracidia, and cercariae were deducted from the Ct value obtained for sporocyst transcript levels using the ΔΔCt method (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119102) Google Scholar), with tubulin gene levels serving as the internal standard.Sporocyst Labeling—200 transformed sporocysts were incubated for 24 h in 96-well plates in minimum salt medium at a concentration of 1000 sporocysts ml–1 in the presence of radioactive precursors (2 μCi of l-[35S]methionine or 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences)) and different doses (10–6 to 10–9m, final concentration) of human EGF (R&D Systems). After incubation, parasites were collected, and 35S radioactivity was measured in the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material using a scintillation liquid (Beckman) and a Packard scintillation counter. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined after filtration onto GF/C filters (Packard) using a cell harvester (Packard) and a Packard microplate scintillation counter. 32P labeling was performed under similar conditions with the addition of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol–1). Labeling was stopped after 5 min of incubation by the addition of 0.2 volume of 10% SDS and boiling for 2 min. Proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity was determined.RESULTSHuman EGF Activates SER in MDCK Epithelial Cells—The full-length SER sequence (GenBank™ accession no. M86396) was amplified by RT-PCR from adult schistosome RNA, cloned in-frame into the pcDNA3.1-V5/His expression vector and expressed in MDCK epithelial cells. In vitro kinase assays on immune complexes formed after precipitation of cell extracts with anti-V5 antibodies confirmed that the recombinant protein was an active kinase, able to phosphorylate MBP (bovine myelin basic protein) substrate and to autophosphorylate, as already shown by Ramachandran et al. (13Ramachandran H. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Transactivation assays were further performed in SER-expressing MDCK cells co-transfected with the Py-Luc reporter vector. This vector contains Ras-responsive elements with three tandem copies of a polyoma virus enhancer-derived sequence with ETS/AP1 binding sites linked to the thymidine kinase promoter and the luciferase reporter gene (18Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This co-transfection system has been demonstrated to be a sensitive assay to analyze functional activity of receptor tyrosine kinase (17Fafeur V. Tulasne D. Queva C. Vercamer C. Dimster V. Mattot V. Stehelin D. Desbiens X. Vandenbunder B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1 indicated that in SER-transfected cells, human EGF is able to increase the Ras-dependent transcriptional response in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum luciferase activity detected with EGF concentrations of ≥10–9m. In control cells transfected with the empty vector, a basal level of luciferase activity was detected, and its moderate increase in the presence of EGF was attributed to activation of the endogeneous canine EGF-R. These results already suggested that SER expressed in mammalian cells was able to trigger a Ras pathway in response to EGF, but the level of protein expression in MDCK cells was too low to pursue the analysis of receptor activation and phosphorylation in this expression system.EGF Induces GVBD in SER-expressing Oocytes—Xenopus oocytes are frequently used to express proteins, and they have already been shown to express with efficacy S. mansoni proteins (23Pierce R. Aimar C. Balloul J.M. Delarue M. Grausz D. Verwaerde C. Capron A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered these cells as an alternative model for the expression of the SER receptor. Results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrated that translation of SER cRNA, in vitro-transcribed from SER-containing plasmids, was efficient in oocytes. After 48 h of incubation, the presence of the [35S]methionine-labeled SER protein was detected in oocyte membranes. The labeled band of 215 kDa exhibited an apparent molecular mass larger than that expected for the recombinant protein (192 kDa), which could be attributable to glycosylation, a processing required for translocation of the receptor to the cell surface and subsequent acquisition of function (24Slieker L.J. Martensen T.M. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15233-15241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2The SER protein is expressed efficiently in Xenopus oocytes. Membrane extracts from 35S-labeled oocytes injected with SER, SERTK–, or water and incubated for 48 h were immunoprecipitated by anti-V5 monoclonal antibody, and immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results of two independent experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Besides their use in examining protein production, oocytes have been shown to represent a suitable model for investigating receptor tyrosine kinase activation and transduction cascades. They are physiologically arrested at the G2-M transition of the first meiotic prophase, and this blockade can be abolished upon activation of receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways. Ras activation triggers the MAPK cascade and causes phosphorylation of the ERK2/MAPK, which is necessary and sufficient to induce meiosis reinitiation characterized by oocyte GVBD (25Haccard O. Lewellyn A. Hartley R.S. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig 3A indicate that human EGF induced GVBD in a high percentage of oocytes expressing the human EGF-R (HER). GVBD resulted essentially from HER activation because no GVBD was detected in noninjected control oocytes or in HER-expressing oocytes in the absence of EGF. When similar experiments were performed with SER-expressing oocytes, we observed that human EGF was also able to induce GVBD in such oocytes, at levels comparable with that found for HER-expressing oocytes. The percentage of GVBD induced by 16.6 nm EGF in HER oocytes (61.6 ± 35.4%) was not significantly different from that found in SER oocytes (40.8 ± 27.5%) at the same ligand concentration. In these experiments, we could demonstrate that SER kinase activity was directly implicated in GVBD induction by analyzing oocytes injected with a SER sequence mutated in its thymidine kinase domain (SERTK–). Results in Fig. 3A show that a single mutation in the Mg2+-binding site of the receptor kinase domain completely abolished GVBD in SERTK–-expressing oocytes. Results of immunoprecipitation confirmed that the mutated SER protein was expressed at a similar level as the native receptor (Fig. 2).Fig. 3A, induction of GVBD in EGF-R-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Percentages of oocytes exhibiting GVBD 15 h after addition of EGF are shown. Oocytes that had been expressing HER, SER, or SERTK– for 48 h were incubated with different concentrations (8.3, 16.6, or 49.8 nm) of human EGF. Each experiment was performed using a set of 15 oocytes. Noninjected oocytes (N.I.) were used as controls. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of GVBD percentages obtained from n independent experiments (HER, n = 3; SER, n = 4; SERTK–, n = 2). B, receptor and phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of EGF-activated SER. Oocytes expressing SER or SERTK– for 48 h were stimulated (+) or not (–) by 49.8 nm human EGF for 5 min. SER and SERTK– proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-V5 antibodies, and phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of SER and SERTK– proteins was confirmed by the use of anti-V5 antibodies. C, Western blot analysis of EGF-induced ERK2 phosphorylation in oocytes. After 48 h of SERTK–, SER, or HER expression, oocytes were incubated without (–) or with (+) 16.6 nm human EGF for 15 h. Oocyte lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ERK2 antibodies. The respective positions of ERK and phosphorylated ERK (ERK-P) proteins are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SER Activates ERK Phosphorylation in Oocytes—To determine the nature of the si"
https://openalex.org/W2085626220,"Serine acetyltransferase (SAT) catalyzes the first step of cysteine synthesis in microorganisms and higher plants. Here we present the 2.2 Å crystal structure of SAT from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, which is a dimer of trimers, in complex with cysteine. The SAT monomer consists of an amino-terminal α-helical domain and a carboxyl-terminal left-handed β-helix. We identify His<sup>158</sup> and Asp<sup>143</sup> as essential residues that form a catalytic triad with the substrate for acetyl transfer. This structure shows the mechanism by which cysteine inhibits SAT activity and thus controls its own synthesis. Cysteine is found to bind at the serine substrate site and not the acetyl-CoA site that had been reported previously. On the basis of the geometry around the cysteine binding site, we are able to suggest a mechanism for the <i>O</i>-acetylation of serine by SAT. We also compare the structure of SAT with other left-handed β-helical structures."
https://openalex.org/W2003107930,"A chemically novel autoinducer (PI factor) has been purified from cultures of the pimaricin producer Streptomyces natalensis ATCC27448. The chemical structure of the PI molecule was identified as 2,3-diamino-2,3-bis (hydroxymethyl)-1,4-butanediol. Pimaricin biosynthesis in S. natalensis npi287, a mutant impaired in pimaricin production, was restored by supplementation with either A-factor from Streptomyces griseus IFO13350 or with PI factor. S. natalensis did not synthesize A-factor. The PI autoinducer was active at very low concentrations (50–350 nm). A threshold level of 50 nm was required to observe the induction effect. The dose-response curve was typical of a quorum-sensing type mechanism. The biosynthesis of PI factor was associated with cell growth of S. natalensis, both in defined and complex media. Supplementation of the wild-type S. natalensis with pure PI (300 nm) resulted in a stimulation of 33% of the production of pimaricin. These results indicate that the endogenous synthesis of PI factor is limiting for pimaricin biosynthesis in the wild-type strain. This water-soluble PI factor belongs to a novel class of autoinducers in Streptomyces species different from the classical butyrolactone autoinducers. Because restoration of pimaricin production in the npi287 mutant is conferred by both A-factor and PI factor, S. natalensis appears to be able to integrate different quorum signals from actinomycetes.

In an effort to understand the regulation of the commercially important antifungal pimaricin, it was of great interest to isolate and characterize the autoregulatory molecule of pimaricin biosynthesis in S. natalensis. We describe in this article the isolation of a class of mutants that is defective in pimaricin production because it lacked a pimaricin inducer. Complementation tests of this mutant and purification of the inducer molecule led to the identification of a novel hydrophilic pimaricin inducer (PI) molecule. Strains—The wild-type S. natalensis ATCC 27448 was used as the parental strain to isolate different npi mutants. S. natalensis cultures were maintained on solid TBO sporulation medium (containing per liter tomato paste, 20 g; oat meal, 25 g; agar, 25 g) as described previously (12Aparicio J.F. Fouces R. Mendes M.V. Olivera N. Martín J.F. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 895-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Candida utilis (syn. Pichia jadinii) CECT 1061 was used as test strain in the bioassay of the antifungal activity of pimaricin. Cultures of S. griseus IFO 13350 (formerly described as S. bikiniensis IFO 13350 2S. Horinouchi, personal communication.; were used to produce A-factor in YMPG medium (28Horinouchi S. Nishiyama M. Suzuki H. Kumada Y. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). S. griseus HH1 (an A factor negative strain) was used to quantify the A-factor inducing activity. Mutagenesis and Isolation of Non-producing Clones—Spores of S. natalensis ATCC 27448 (about 106 spores/ml) were suspended in 0.05 m Tris-maleate buffer, pH 9.0 and mutated with N-methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (1 mg/ml) for 20 min at 30 °C. Under those conditions the mortality after 20 min was about 50%. The mutated spores were washed, diluted, and plated in YED medium and incubated at 28 °C. When the colonies started to grow (24 h), agar plugs (7-mm diameter) containing individual colonies were cut out from the plates, incubated under high aw (humidity) conditions for an additional 24 h, and the pimaricin production by each clone was assayed on a lawn of C. utilis. Mutants that did not produce inhibition zones were selected. The lack of production of pimaricin of the selected mutants was confirmed in liquid cultures in SPG medium (29Gil J.A. Naharro G. Villanueva J.R. Martín J.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 1279-1287PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants that did not revert in liquid medium cultures were further analyzed by complementation tests. Culture Media and Quantification of Pimaricin Production in Liquid Cultures—Four different complex media were used for quantification of the PI factor concentration and its relationship to pimaricin production. These include: NBG medium (nutrient broth (Oxoid) supplemented with glucose (5 g/liter)); YEME medium (yeast extract 3 g/liter; peptone 5 g/liter; malt extract 3 g/liter, and glucose 10 g/liter); TSB medium (Difco) and YED medium (yeast extract 10 g/liter; glucose 10 g/liter). In addition two defined media were also used to quantify the inducer production: Streptomyces MM (30Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Charter K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich2000Google Scholar) and Lechevalier-defined medium (31Martín J.F. McDaniel L.E. Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1976; 3: 135-144Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The production of pimaricin in liquid cultures was routinely quantified by spectrophotometric determination at 319 nm. A 0.5-ml aliquot of the culture was extracted with 5 ml of methanol and diluted with distilled water; the concentration of pimaricin was determined as described previously (12Aparicio J.F. Fouces R. Mendes M.V. Olivera N. Martín J.F. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 895-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) using a pure sample of pimaricin (Sigma) as standard. Complementation Tests—Complementation tests were performed between pairs of the 35 stable non-producer mutants using standard co-synthesis methods in solid YED medium. Each pair of npi mutants was grown as lawn cultures. Agar plugs were taken out from each of the growth zones and the production of pimaricin was bioassayed using Candida utilis as the sensitive organism. Positive complementation was clearly detected by the production of pimaricin when the two non-producer mutants were placed close to each other, whereas control plugs from each of the two non-producer mutants gave no inhibition zone when assayed separately (Fig. 1). Extraction and HPLC Purification of the PI Factor to Homogeneity— The culture broth (15 liters) from S. natalensis wild-type strain grown for 24 h in YED medium in a Braun Biostat C fermentor was concentrated 10-fold in a vacuum evaporator. The concentrated broth was clarified by precipitating the proteins with HCl at pH 3.0 in the cold room. The clarified broth was adjusted to pH 7.0 with concentrated NaOH and extracted with ethyl acetate (see “Experimental Procedures”). The organic phase was then collected and concentrated to dryness under vacuum and the inducer was dissolved in 100 ml of 10% methanol (v/v) and applied to an active carbon column (30 × 3 cm) previously equilibrated with the same solvent (10% methanol, v/v). The retained compounds including the PI factor were fractionated by stepwise elution (flow 2 ml/min) with 50% methanol (v/v), 100% methanol, 10% ethyl acetate in methanol (v/v), 50% ethyl acetate in methanol (v/v), and pure ethyl acetate. Bioassays of the PI factor showed that it eluted in the second fraction (100% methanol). The inducing fraction was then concentrated, applied onto a Sephadex G10 column (2000 × 1 cm), and eluted with distilled water (flow 0.2 ml/min). This size exclusion chromatography yielded 40 ml of active fractions. The PI factor was purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Waters 600 unit coupled to a PDA 996 detector equipped with a Polarity C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm; particle size, 5 μm). The PI factor elutes at a retention time of 2.5 min using a mobile phase mixture consisting of a linear gradient of acetonitrile-water (from 1:99 (v/v) at time 0 to 70:30 (v/v) at 15 min). The pure PI factor was derivatized with FMOC (fluorenylmethyl chloroformate) as described by Sim and Perry (32Sim K.L. Perry D. Glycoconjugate J. 1997; 14: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Determination of PI Factor Biological Activity—The biological activity of PI factor was determined by its ability to induce pimaricin production by mutant strain S. natalensis npi287 in solid SPG medium. After allowing growth of S. natalensis npi287 for 2 days at 30 °C, samples of culture broths (100 μl) or of different fractions from the PI factor purification process were added to wells (7-mm diameter) in the agar layer. The plate was then overlaid with a culture of C. utilis in soft agar and incubated for 24 h at 28 °C. The diameter of the C. utilis inhibition zone after induction of pimaricin in strain npi287 was proportional to the amount of PI factor in the sample. Acetylation of PI Factor—Acetylation of PI factor (0.1 mg) was made with a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride (4 ml each) for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. The resulting product was lyophilized and the acetylated PI was dissolved in dichloromethane. For the deacetylation process acetyl-PI was hydrolyzed by dropwise addition of concentrated NaOH (5 g) in methanol (5 ml), and the conversion of acetyl-PI to PI was followed by TLC. NMR Spectroscopy—The structure elucidation of PI factor was established by NMR spectroscopy, using a combination of one-dimensional NMR methods (1H NMR and 13C NMR) and two-dimensional shift-correlated NMR techniques (HMQC-HSQC and HMBC), for the complete 1H and 13C signal assignments. NMR spectra were recorded in D2O at room temperature using a Bruker WM 500 spectrometer (500 MHz (1H NMR) and 125 MHz (13C NMR)). Chemical shifts are given on the δ-scale and were referenced to the solvent and to dioxane as internal signal. The pulse programs of the two-dimensional experiments were taken from the Bruker software library, and the parameters were as follows: 500/125 MHz gradient-selected HMQC spectra (33Wilker W. Leibfritz D. Kerssebaum R. Bermell W. Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry. 1993; 31: 287-292Crossref Scopus (959) Google Scholar), relaxation delay D1 = 1.5 s; evolution delay D2 = 3.33 ms; delay for evolution of long range coupling (HMBC) D6 = 60 ms. The ES+ mass spectrum was recorded on a HP 1100-MSD using CF3COOH 0.1% as the source of ionization. Classes of S. natalensis Mutants Impaired in Pimaricin Biosynthesis and Cross-feeding Studies—A total of 384 non-producer mutants impaired in pimaricin (npi) biosynthesis (npi-1 to npi-384) were isolated after NTG mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Some of them reverted or were unstable. After several rounds of selection 35 stable npi mutants were selected (Table I) and assayed in pairwise complementation tests on solid YED medium (Fig. 1). Based on the results of the complementation tests, the mutants were divided into 11 classes (A–K in Table I).Table IComplementation classes of npi (non-producer mutants) of S. natalensisClassesComplemented classesA. npi380B, C, D, E, G, J, KB. npi16, npi235A, C, E, GC. npi275A, B, D, G, I, JD. npi31A, CE. npi38A, BF. npi30, npi71, npi83, npi85, npi116, npi140, npi148, npi178, npi226, npi238, npi249, npi276GG. npi287A, B, C, F, JH. npi6, npi12, npi54, npi64, npi86, npi98, npi137NoneI. npi22, npi255CJ. npi79, npi88, npi169, npi218, npi384A, C, GK. npi39, npi271A Open table in a new tab A group of seven mutants (npi-6, npi-12, npi-54, npi-64, npi-86, npi-98, and npi-137) (class H in Table I) were unable to complement any other mutant class or vice versa, probably because these mutants were blocked in one of the pimaricinolide synthases (11Aparicio J.F. Colina A. Ceballos E. Martín J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10133-10139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Aparicio J.F. Fouces R. Mendes M.V. Olivera N. Martín J.F. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 895-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the large intermediates that these enzymes produce could not diffuse out of the cells. Non-producer mutants of classes A, B, C, F, and J were all able to complement npi287 (class G) (Table I). The results of these complementation tests indicated that npi mutants of classes A, B, C, F, and J were able to produce a substance that complements pimaricin production in npi287 and that these mutants were blocked later in the biosynthetic pathway. Mutant npi287 responded clearly to the spent culture broth of the wild-type S. natalensis ATCC27448 (see below) and was therefore used as test strain (converter) for the presence of the putative inducer. Mutant classes D, E, I, and K failed to complement the inducer-requiring class G (see below) and, therefore, may also contain mutations related to the inducer biosynthesis. Mutant npi287 Recovers Normal Pimaricin Production When Supplemented with S. natalensis Wild-type Culture Broth or with A-factor from S. griseus—Since initial studies indicated that mutant npi287 recovered pimaricin production in co-synthesis experiments with different S. natalensis mutant strains we tested its complementation with spent culture broths of the parental strain S. natalensis ATCC 27448. Results showed that mutant npi287 recovered full pimaricin production levels when supplemented with culture broths of the S. natalensis wild-type strain grown for 24 h in either YED, NBG, or YEME media suggesting that the inducer was secreted by the wild-type strain. Our first working hypothesis was that the pimaricin inducer might belong to the A-factor butyrolactone family because such class of inducing compounds are common among Streptomyces species (15Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 377-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1990; 10: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis mutant npi287 was supplemented with increasing concentrations of HPLC-purified A-factor from S. griseus IFO 13350. As shown in Fig. 2, the production of pimaricin by npi287 was restored by addition of A-factor. To discern if the pimaricin inducer was a butyrolactone or a different molecule we followed initially the purification procedure described for the virginia butanolides from S. virginiae (18Yamada Y. Sugamura K. Kondo K. Yanagimoto M. Okada H. J. Antibiot. 1987; 40: 496504Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The procedure is based on extraction of the butyrolactones with ethyl acetate under acidic pH conditions (pH 2.0) followed by concentration of the organic phase, and application of the concentrate through an active carbon column followed by stepwise elution with 50% methanol in water (v/v) or 100% methanol. As a control, A-factor was purified from cultures of S. griseus IFO 13350. As expected, A-factor was purified using this protocol and eluted in the 100% methanol fraction. Surprisingly, in contrast to what occurs with butyrolactones, a significant proportion of the pimaricin inducing compound remained in the aqueous phase after ethyl acetate extraction at either acidic, neutral, or slightly basic (pH 7.5) pH values, suggesting that the inducer was a hydrophilic molecule. The Purified PI Factor Is Different from A-factor—The PI factor was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After elution from the Sephadex G10 column the biologically active fractions were further purified by reverse phase HPLC chromatography. Aliquots were derivatized with FMOC for an easy detection (Fig. 3). The pure PI compound was used for mass spectrometry and NMR analyses. The S. griseus IFO13350 A-factor was purified by following its biological activity on the test strain S. griseus HH1, a mutant lacking streptomycin production due to its deficiency in A-factor biosynthesis. As indicated above, the purified S. griseus A-factor containing fraction elicited pimaricin production in the S. natalensis npi287 mutant (Fig. 2) as also did the crude culture broth of the streptomycin-producing parental strain of S. griseus IFO13350. These results indicated that pimaricin production by our npi287 strain responded to A-factor. Interestingly, the opposite tests were negative. Neither the wild-type S. natalensis culture broth nor the HPLC-pure PI factor restored streptomycin production to the S. griseus HH1 mutant, further indicating that the PI factor was different from A-factor and specific for S. natalensis. In contrast to the well known stimulation of sporulation of S. griseus HH1 exerted by A-factor, the pure PI factor did not stimulate sporulation of the wild-type S. natalensis or the npi287 mutant. These results, together with the capability of the PI factor (but not of A-factor) to react with FMOC, clearly supported the proposal that the nature of both compounds is different. The ability of the PI factor to react with FMOC suggested the presence of amino groups in its structure, while the lack of reaction of A-factor under the same conditions confirmed the absence of such groups in the A-factor structure. To study whether any traces of PI factor might be produced by the S. griseus strain, comparative HPLC analysis of the pure PI and the A-factor containing fraction were performed. Results (Fig. 3) showed that the active PI factor derivatized with FMOC eluted at 11.0 min (Fig. 3, A and C), whereas no peak could be observed at 11.0 min in the A-factor chromatogram after FMOC derivatization (Fig. 3B). Chemical Structure of the PI Factor—The 1H NMR spectrum of PI factor (Fig. 4) showed only a signal at δ 3.71 ppm as a singlet whereas its 13C NMR spectrum contained two signals, which were assigned to one methylene group (CH2, δ 58.76 ppm) and one quaternary carbon atom at δ 60.87 ppm. This was confirmed by means of a DEPT study. Assignment of the carbon atom of the methylene group was carried out by using a HMQC spectrum, which showed a correlation peak via1JH,C with the methylene protons at δ 3.71 ppm. In the HMBC spectrum one key correlation peak via3JC,H was obtained between the methylene protons and the quaternary carbon atom at δ 60.87 ppm. The low field nature of the chemical shifts (δH and δC) of the methylene group suggested the presence of an oxygenated group (-CH2OH). This was easily confirmed by comparison with the NMR spectra of the acetylated derivative PIa (Fig. 4). The 1H NMR spectrum of the acetylated derivative (recorded in CDCl3) showed two singlets at δ 1.25 and 4.43 ppm, which were attributed to a methyl group (CH3COO-) and a methylene group (CH3COOCH2-), respectively; and the 13CNMR spectrum showed four signals at δ 20.70 ppm (CH3), δ 58.10 ppm (C), δ 62.71 ppm (CH2), and δ 170.60 ppm (CO). The downfield shift of the quaternary carbon atom and the variation of the chemical shifts by the pH change (see Table II), suggested the presence of an amine group. This was confirmed by means of the mass spectrum. The PI compound gave an ion at m/z 91 [M+2H]+/2 on the positive electrospray (ES+) indicating a double-charged species. On the basis of all available data the structure of compound PI is proposed to be 2,3-diamino-2,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1,4-butanediol (Fig. 4).Table II1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data of PI (in D2O; chemical shifts in δ ppm)GrouppH = 5.20pH = 8.051H13C1H13CCH23.71 s58.763.66 s59.44C60.8759.93 Open table in a new tab Dose Response: The PI Factor Works at Low Concentrations— The availability of the pure PI compound allowed us to quantify its inducing effect using the standard inducer assay with the npi287 strain (Fig. 5). The npi287 strain clearly responded to PI concentrations of 100 nm and the pimaricin production showed a linear response up to 350 nm. The inducer increased the diameter of the pimaricin inhibition zone up to a concentration of 350 nm, and the assay was saturated at concentrations above 400 nm. A threshold level of PI of about 50 nm was always required to detect the induction of pimaricin production. These results are consistent with a cooperative effect typical of a quorum-sensing type mechanism. Following addition of PI factor (200 ng/ml) to npi287 mutant cultures, most of the PI factor was taken up by the cells and only 10 ng/ml remained in the culture broth 24 h after addition. The PI level in the broth increased to 22 and 15 ng/ml at 48 and 72 h, respectively, suggesting that a residual level is released after initial binding to the cells. The Production of Pimaricin by the Wild-type Strain S. natalensis ATCC 27448 Is Stimulated by Exogenous PI Factor—In quorum-sensing systems the autoinducer signal is secreted by some cells in the culture population, and the inducer is incorporated by other cells to trigger differentiation or other biochemical switches. The production of pimaricin by the parental strain S. natalensis ATCC 27448 in NBG, TSB, and YEME media was stimulated by the addition of 300 nm PI factor in the three culture media. Since the wild-type strain synthesizes endogenous PI factor, the stimulatory effect of exogenous inducer indicates that its biosynthesis is limiting for pimaricin production in the wild type. Furthermore the results indicate that PI factor is taken up by S. natalensis or at least it triggers at the membrane level a signal cascade leading to overproduction of pimaricin. Kinetics of Formation of PI Factor in Cultures of S. natalensis in Defined and Complex Media—The time of synthesis of the PI factor is relevant to trigger the onset of pimaricin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the level of inducer formed may be limiting for total pimaricin accumulation. To analyze the time course of PI factor biosynthesis, S. natalensis ATCC 27448 was grown in two defined media, namely MM for Streptomyces (30Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Charter K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich2000Google Scholar) and Lechevalier medium (31Martín J.F. McDaniel L.E. Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1976; 3: 135-144Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and in four complex media TSB, NBG, YED, and YEME (see “Experimental Procedures”) that are known to support high pimaricin production. The two defined medium supported low yields of pimaricin (not shown). In both Streptomyces MM and Lechevalier media, PI factor was synthesized during growth and a peak (8 to 10 ng/ml) was observed at the end of rapid growth phase of S. natalensis (equivalent to the exponential growth phase of unicellular bacteria). Biosynthesis of pimaricin in these two defined media was parallel to the growth of the culture with a delay of about 12 h with respect to the inducer formation. These results indicate that the synthesis of PI is related to the growth phase. All complex media were found to support much higher levels of pimaricin production ranging from 620 μg/ml in TSB medium to 920 μg/ml in YEME medium (Fig. 6). In the four complex media the PI factor was formed earlier than pimaricin coinciding with the end of the rapid growth phase and reached levels of PI between 25 ng/ml in YEME and NBG and 45 ng/ml in TSB media that were clearly higher (about 3–4-fold) than the level of inducer in defined media. A special mention deserves the YED medium in which PI factor accumulated to levels of 140 ng/ml. Production of pimaricin in this medium did not match the high level of PI factor observed. These results indicate that biosynthetic steps other than the level of PI factor are limiting for pimaricin production above PI saturation levels in this medium. To confirm that the PI inducer is produced during growth of S. natalensis cultures and is not present in the complex media used in these experiments all media were tested by HPLC before inoculation and after 48 h of incubation with S. natalensis. Results are shown in Fig. 7 for the NBG medium. There was no PI inducer in the complex medium before inoculation and it clearly accumulated after 48 h of incubation in this medium. To confirm the absence of PI, the NBG medium was primed with pure PI inducer. As shown in Fig. 7B, the HPLC elution profile of the PI-supplemented culture medium confirmed the lack of this molecule in the starting culture medium. Intercellular communication has been reported in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria including Vibrio fischeri, Myxococcus xantus (35Allison C. Hughes C. Sci. Prog. 1991; 75: 403-422PubMed Google Scholar), Erwinia caratovora (22Bainton N.J. Bycroft B.W. Chhabra S.R. Stead P. Gledhill L. Hill P.J. Rees C.E.D. Winson M.K. Salmond G.P.C. Stewart G.S.A.B.

Strain specificity of autoinducers is common among Streptomyces species due to the formation of either different inducer molecules (18Yamada Y. Sugamura K. Kondo K. Yanagimoto M. Okada H. J. Antibiot. 1987; 40: 496504Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or to differences in their stereochemistry (37Sakuda S. Yamada Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 1817-1820Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several of these molecules including A-factor, the virginia butanolides and related compounds belong to the butyrolactone family (15Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 377-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yamada Y. Sugamura K. Kondo K. Yanagimoto M. Okada H. J. Antibiot. 1987; 40: 496504Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Takano E.

The butyrolactones appear to occur in many but not all Streptomyces strains (34Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1990; 10: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However other types of autoinducers occur in some actinomycetes (23Kawaguchi T. Asahi T. Satoh T. Uozumi T. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1984; 37: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Kawaguchi T. Azuma M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1988; 41: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A recent report described a novel boron-containing autoinducer (25Chen X. Schauder S. Potier N. Dorsselaer A.V. Pelczer I. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that novel types of quorum-sensing effectors will be discovered. As reported in this article a novel type of autoinducer has been found in the pimaricin producer S. natalensis. This autoinducer complements the non-producer S. natalensis class G mutant. The molecule 2,3-diamino-2,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1,4-butanediol (PI factor) is symmetrical and has not been reported before in the microbial world. The tetraacetylated derivative of PI showed no inducing ability indicating that the hydroxyl groups of this molecule are strictly required for interaction with its receptor protein. The PI inducer has an entirely novel chemical structure that is only distantly related to the homoserine lactone and the furanosyl diester (25Chen X. Schauder S. Potier N. Dorsselaer A.V. Pelczer I. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar) inducer families. It is interesting that class G mutant npi287 also recovers pimaricin production when complemented with A-factor, suggesting that there is a mechanism of signal integration that switches gene expression in response to either PI factor or A-factor. However we have shown that S. natalensis does not produce A-factor. It will be interesting to know if the PI factor induction is mediated by a butyrolactone-type receptor (38Kinoshita H. Tsuji T.

Cross-talk between populations co-existing in the soil (36Kaiser D. Losick R. Cell. 1993; 73: 873-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) may be explained by the use of specific or wide-domain inducers. Some classes of inducers (e.g. butyrolactones) may affect a variety of Streptomyces species whereas others (e.g. PI factor) might have a narrow specificity. The time course of biosynthesis of the PI inducer in complex media shows that formation of PI factor is parallel to growth, in six different media tested both defined and complex. It is important to note that in mycelial organisms such as Streptomyces, there is not a clear-cut separation of the growth phase and the production phase, in contrast to what occurs in unicellular bacteria. Therefore, onset of pimaricin biosynthesis by old cells occurs while young cells in the hyphal tips are still growing. The dose-response curve of pimaricin to increasing concentrations of PI factor shows a sigmoidal curve with a minimal threshold level. When PI factor was added to cultures of the npi287 mutant unable to produce it, PI was initially taken up by the cells and a small amount was then released into the culture broth. These results clearly indicate that the PI inducer shows a standard quorum-sensing type of kinetics: the PI molecule is, therefore, secreted and signals to other cells that they must start to produce pimaricin in response to biomass accumulation, nutrient limitation or other environmental conditions. This quorum-sensing type of response requires low concentrations of inducer (41Fuqua C. Parsek M.R. Greenberg E.P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 439-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), usually in the nanomolar range, as occurs with the PI factor. An important question is whether higher levels of inducer increase further pimaricin biosynthesis. As shown in this article addition of 300 nm PI factor to cultures of the pimaricin producer wild type S. natalensis strain increased pimaricin production between 20 and 40% in different media. These results suggest that under standard culture conditions, the concentration of extracellular PI factor in complex media is still limiting for pimaricin production. Therefore metabolic engineering of the PI factor biosynthesis is a subject of great interest for improving pimaricin production. The characterization of the PI inducer opens the possibility of genetic modification of its biosynthesis to understand the molecular mechanism of signal transduction. We thank S.

Aggrus/T1α/podoplanin is known to be expressed in lung type I alveolar cells or lymphatic endothelial cells. However, its physiological role has not been clarified. To assess the attribution of glycosylation to Aggrus platelet aggregation activity, recombinant molecules were stably expressed in a series of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants, N-glycan-deficient Lec1, CMP-sialic acid transporter-deficient Lec2, and UDP-galactose transporter-deficient Lec8. A new anti-human Aggrus monoclonal antibody, YM-1, was established to detect the expression of human Aggrus on these CHO cell mutants. Aggrus on Lec1 cells induced platelet aggregation, but those on Lec2 and Lec8 cells did not. Further, the glycans on Aggrus were analyzed by lectin blotting. Aggrus expressed in CHO and Lec1 cells showed Wheat-germ agglutinin, Jacalin, and Vicia villosa lectin bindings. Lectin blotting results indicated that sialylated core 1 structures, sialic acid plus Galβ1,3GalNAc-Ser/Thr, were critical for the platelet aggregation activity.

T1α/podoplanin conceivably plays an important role in regulating peripheral lung cell proliferation and lymphatic vascular development. In the experiment with respect to the 8F11 antibody that neutralized the platelet aggregating activity, it was evident that the segment of EDXXVTPG in the extracellular domain, designated as platelet aggregation-stimulating domain, was critical for the activity of Aggrus (3Kato Y.

In particular, this motif, which is highly conserved among species, is tandemly triplicated in gp40 of dog. The occurrence of O-glycosylation to Thr residues was proved by Edman degenerative microsequencing (17Zimmer G. Lottspeich F. Maisner A. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. Biochem.

Furthermore, in the study of targeted mutagenesis to mouse and human Aggrus molecules, we obtained evidence that glycans on the platelet aggregation-stimulating domain play an important role for platelet aggregation (3Kato Y.

The present study examined the association of glycosylation with the platelet aggregating activity; recombinant Aggrus molecules were expressed in a set of three defective cell lines from Pro-5 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; SA, sialic acid; Gal, galactose; WGA, Wheat-germ agglutinin; s-WGA, succinylated WGA; VVA, Vicia villosa lectin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; h, human; m, mouse. cells. Those mutant cells have defects in distinct steps of glycosylation. Lec1 CHO cells lack the glycosyltransferase termed GlcNAc-TI, which produces incomplete intermediates of N-linked carbohydrates (18Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lec2 cells are CMP-sialic acid transporter-deficient. In addition, both glycoproteins and glycolipids lack 90% of sialic acids (SA). Lec8 cells exhibit a remarkable reduction of the ability to transport UDP-galactose (Gal) into the Golgi compartment (22Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation-inducing activity was examined in those stably transfected cells. Moreover, the structure of active glycans was examined by the lectin-blot analysis. In addition, a monoclonal antibody to human Aggrus (hAggrus) was obtained by immunizing rat with the synthetic hAggrus peptide. Materials—Lymphatic endothelial cell was purchased from AngioBio (Del Mar, CA). Lung carcinoma cells, NCI-H226, and NCI-H520 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The anti-mouse Aggrus rat monoclonal antibody (mAb), 8F11, was prepared previously (24Watanabe M. Okochi E. Sugimoto Y. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6411-6416PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse anti-human podoplanin (gp36) mAb was obtained from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from DakoCytomation Co., Ltd. (Glostrup, Denmark). Fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG was obtained from Cappel (Cochranville, PA). Fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from MC Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The following biotinylated lectins were purchased from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Peterborough, UK), concanavalin A, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, peanuts agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin I, soybean agglutinin, Wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA), succinylated WGA (s-WGA), Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I and II, Sophora japonica agglutinin, Datura stramonium lectin, Jacalin, Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, Solanum tuberosum lectin, Vicia villosa lectin (VVA), Sambucus nigra lectin, and Maackia amurensis lectin I and II. Hybridoma Production—Two Sprague-Dawley rats were immunized with the synthetic peptide, CEGGVAMPGAEDDVV, corresponding to amino acids 38-51 of hAggrus plus an N-terminal cysteine. The spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma P3U1 cells. Then the culture supernatants of the hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the binding activity to the Aggrus peptide. The established mAb was designated YM-1. Immunohistochemistry—YM-1 was added to the deparaffinized and rehydrated specimens for 4 h at 23 °C. Biotin-conjugated secondary anti-rat IgG antibody was added, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin-streptavidin complex (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories Inc.). Color was developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride tablet sets (DakoCytomation Co. Ltd.) used for 10 min. The human specimens were derived from prostate cancer (25Tian W. Osawa M.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with α-minimal essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Moregate Biotech, Queensland, Australia), supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), l-pro-line (0.04 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Human and mouse aggrus cDNAs (AB127958, AJ297944), incorporated with FLAG tag sequence, were subcloned into a vector of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which were named as pcDNA-hAGR and pcDNA-mAGR, respectively. Lec1, Lec2, and Lec8 cells were transfected with pcDNA-hAGR and pcDNA-mAGR by a procedure using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (3Kato Y. Fujita N. Kunita A. Sato S. Kaneko M. Osawa M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51599-51605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Stable production was obtained using a selective culture of the transfectants in a medium containing Geneticin (G418; Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml for a couple of weeks. Flow Cytometry—The expression levels of hAggrus and mouse Aggrus (mAggrus) were confirmed comparatively using by flow cytometry, as described previously (26Kaneko M. Kato Y. Horiuchi H. Osawa M. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 86: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, lymphatic endothelial cells, NCIH226 cells, parental CHO cells, and Lec cells, collected by trypsin-EDTA treatment, were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, YM-1 culture supernatant, and 8F11 in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Then the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed using FACS Caliber (BD Biosciences). Platelet Aggregation—Platelet aggregation was examined by the procedures of Toyoshima et al. (5Toyoshima M. Nakajima M. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 767-773PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse platelet-rich plasma was prepared from fresh heparinized blood extracted from BALB/c mice. An aliquot of 200 μl of platelet-rich plasma was incubated in a cuvette at 37 °C with continuous stirring. After 5 min, 5 μl of phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells were added. Then light transmittance was monitored at 660 nm for 10 min. This assay was performed with a NKK HEMA Tracer I (Niko Bioscientific Co., Tokyo, Japan). A photograph was taken using a phase contrast microscope (100×, microphoto Fxa; Nikon Corp.) at the same time. Western Blot Analyses and Lectin Blotting—Cultured cell pellets were lysed with a buffer for 30 min on ice. The buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris, 50 mm sodium chloride, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. The lysate supernatants were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm to remove cellular debris and nuclei. Cell lysates containing 5 μg of total protein were prepared for Western blot analysis by boiling in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8). For lectin blotting analysis, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After the complexes were washed, elution was performed with a SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10-20% gradient gels. After proteins were transferred onto an immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), the strips were incubated with YM-1 antibody or biotinylated lectins (20 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG or streptavidin coupled to peroxidase. The enzyme activity was developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Establishment of Anti-human Aggrus Monoclonal Antibody—We generated a mAb to hAggrus (YM-1) as described in the previous section. The reactivity of YM-1 was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis, Western blot analysis, and flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1, A-C). YM-1 clearly recognized lymphatic vessel via immunostaining (Fig. 1A). Approximately 36 kDa of Aggrus expressed on human lymphatic endothelial cells and lung cancer cell line NCI-H226 were detected by YM-1 but not anti-podoplanin mAb (Fig. 1B). This result indicated that the YM-1 exhibit more intense immunoreactivity for Aggrus than that of the anti-podoplanin mAb. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis showed that the YM-1 could react more strongly than anti-podoplanin (Fig. 1C). Platelet Aggregation by Lymphatic Endothelial Cells and NCI-H226 Cells—As shown in Fig. 1D, lymphatic endothelial and NCI-H226 cells also induced platelet aggregation as hAggrus on CHO cells did. However, another lung cell carcinoma NCIH520, which did not express hAggrus, did not induce platelet aggregation (data not shown). These results indicated that the spontaneous hAggrus also induced platelet aggregation. Platelet Aggregation by Lec Transfectants—Recombinants were generated in the three mutant cells and parental CHO cells by transfection of pcDNA-hAGR and pcDNA-mAGR to assess the physiological importance of glycosylation on Aggrus molecules. The stable transfectants were established by the Geneticin-selective culture. Expression of recombinant molecules was comparatively confirmed by flow cytometry using the specific antibodies of YM-1 and 8F11 (Fig. 2A). Judging from the shift of peaks, expressional levels of Aggrus were high and equal among these cell transfectants. When the platelet aggregation activity of the established transfectants was examined, both hAggrus and mAggrus in Lec1 cells induced complete platelet aggregation as well as recombinants in parental CHO cells (Fig. 2B). The aggregation was confirmed using varying cell numbers in three independent experiments (data not shown). Real features of induced platelet aggregation are also demonstrated in Fig. 2C as a photograph. In contrast, aggregation was absent in Aggrus molecules expressed in Lec2 and Lec8 cells. Lec1 CHO cells are incapable of synthesizing N-glycan complexes (18Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of mAggrus contained one consensus site for N-glycosylation but did not in hAggrus. Because Lec1 cells lacked N-glycosylation, platelet aggregation activity was not associated with this type of modification. Furthermore, CMP-SA transporter-deficient Lec2 cells lack 90% of common SA decoration in both glycoproteins and glycolipids (21Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Maturation of sialylated structures is inhibited in Lec8 cells, because Gal is the major acceptor for SA in glycoconjugates (22Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecules that are modified by these two cell lines form insufficient SA decoration. Based on these results and interpretation, the presence of SA on O-glycans was conclusively critical for the induction of platelet aggregation. Glycans on Aggrus Expressed in CHO and Lec Cells—To type the O-glycan structure on active hAggrus molecules in the CHO cells, lectin blotting using the 18 lectins, was further performed with immunoprecipitates of the cell lysates (Fig. 3). Table I summarizes this result. The hAggrus that was expressed in Lec1 and parental CHO cells reacted with WGA but not s-WGA. The aggregation-inducing molecules carried SA at their termini because s-WGA recognizes naked GlcNAc in contrast to the interaction of WGA to SA-bound GlcNAc. Jacalin, which recognizes core 1 structure (Galβ1,3GalNAc), reacted with hAggrus molecules expressed in parental, Lec1, and Lec2 CHO cells. This result implies that active molecules possess a sialylated core 1 structure. Furthermore, hAggrus from Lec 8 cells was detected by VVA (to GalNAc-Ser/Thr, called Tn-antigen), Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I, and soybean agglutinin (to GalNAc residue), indicating that the major glycan on hAggrus from Lec8 was Tn-antigen. In addition, hAggrus molecules from Lec2 cells showed slower movement in electrophoresis compared with others. This lower mobility might result from the reduction of negative charges or elongation of O-glycan chain because of the lack of SA. Fig. 4 schematically illustrates the theoretically possible glycosylation structures of Aggrus expressed in the parental CHO and Lec mutant cells.Table ISummary of lectin blot analysis to immunoprecipitated hAggrusLectinSpecificityCHO/hAggrusLec1/hAggrusLec2/hAggrusLec8/hAggrusWGA(GlcNAc)n, SA++−−s-WGA(GlcNAc)n−−−−JacalinGalβ1,3GalNAc+++−Peanut agglutininGalβ1,3GalNAc (w/o SA)−−+−VVAGalNAcα, β−+++R. communis agglutinin IGal, GalNAc (w/o SA)−−+−G. simplicifolia lectinGalNAcα, Galα−−−+Soybean agglutininGalNAcα, β−−−+ Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Scheme representing a possible pathway for O-glycans of Aggrus expressed in Lec mutant cells.

Recently, Aggrus/podoplanin has been utilized as a lymphatic endothelium marker in histopathology. The results of YM-1 immunostaining indicated that this antibody has superior sensitivity to lymphatic endothelium (Fig. 1A). Western blot and flow cytometric analyses indicated that the hAggrus protein is expressed in the lymphatic endothelial cell line and lung cancer cell line, NCI-H226 (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, these results showed that the YM-1 antibody reacted more strongly than the anti-podoplanin antibody. The present study utilized the advantage of unique characteristics of CHO mutant cell lines to show the sialylated O-glycan was critical for the platelet aggregation-inducing activity of Aggrus. O-Glycan profiles of MUC1 expressed in CHO cell lines showed an identical pattern to those produced in the breast carcinoma T47D cells (27Backstrom M. Link T. Olson F.J. Karlsson H. Graham R.

J. 2003; 376: 677-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that recombinant Aggrus in CHO cells, which provoked platelet aggregation, might be decorated as well as glycosylation in cancer cells. Although the physiological importance of the platelet-aggregating activity remains obscure, the fact that Aggrus is expressed in many tumor cells indicated that cancerous glycosylation of Aggrus is attributable to the tumor-induced activity of platelet aggregation during metastasis (3Kato Y. Fujita N. Kunita A. Sato S. Kaneko M. Osawa M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51599-51605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6Kato Y. Sasagawa I. Kaneko M. Osawa M. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Lectin blot analysis showed that active Aggrus molecules expressed in CHO cells bore a sialylated core 1 structure (SAGalβ1,3GalNAc). This structure was basically consistent with those reported in the PA2.26 antigen (28Scholl F.G. Gamallo C. Vilaro S. Quintanilla M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4601-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and gp40 (17Zimmer G. Lottspeich F. Maisner A. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to sialylated and non-sialylated GalNAc-Ser/Thr, called sTn and Tn antigen, respectively, sialylated and nonsialylated core 1 structures are also known as tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (29Dabelsteen E. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 30Byrd J.C. Bresalier R.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2004; 23: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These antigens are distributed widely in glycolipids, membranous mucins, and mucous plasma components in cancer patients. MUC1 mucin has been studied extensively as a target antigen for the immunotherapy of breast and other carcinomas, because the cancer-associated mucin is over-expressed and aberrantly glycosylated. In normal cells, O-glycans expressed on MUC1 typically consist of long and branched, mainly core 2 (GlcNAcβ1-6(Galβ1-3)Gal-NAc-Ser/Thr)-based, oligosaccharides (31Hanisch F.G. Uhlenbruck G.

Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33325-33334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In contrast, the glycans of MUC1 expressed in breast carcinomas transform to increased contents of the shorter non-branched core 1-based structure with enhanced SA addition (33Brockhausen I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26103-26112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). From this point of view, Aggrus in carcinoma cells is thought to be distinct from T1α/podoplanin in normal cells in glycosylation. However, Aggrus in lymphatic endothelial cells and Aggrus in NCI-H226 showed almost the same mobility in Western blot analysis, and both cells induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 1B). The different mobilities of Aggrus from different organs were indicated in previous studies with mouse Aggrus/PA2.26 (3Kato Y. Fujita N. Kunita A. Sato S. Kaneko M. Osawa M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51599-51605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Scholl F.G. Gamallo C. Vilaro S. Quintanilla M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4601-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different mobilities may indicate different glycosylation or conformational changes that were caused by different modifications. Further studies are necessary to analyze the glycan structure on Aggrus molecules from cancer cells and normal cells, especially the glycan in the platelet aggregation-stimulating domain, to clarify whether the different glycosylation has an important correlation with the platelet aggregation activity of Aggrus or not. Recent progress in research has demonstrated that the glycosyl modification is relevant to various physiological functions such as the intracellular signaling pathway (36Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Notch functions in highly conserved intercellular signaling pathways. It plays essential roles in a wide variety of developmental events. A series of studies with deficient CHO cells, including Lec2 and Lec8, have been applied for the Fringe-dependent glycosylation of Notch (36Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L.

Fringe is fucose-specific β1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase that adds GlcNAc to O-fucose on certain epidermal growth factor repeats of Notch (36Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J.

Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The change in sugar structure affects ligand binding (38Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 39Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Similarly, exploiting deficient CHO cells, we found that sialylated glycans on Aggrus promotes platelet aggregation. It is intriguing to speculate that the change in glycosylation modification affect platelet aggregation-inducing activity of Aggrus in vivo. Based on our findings that sialylated glycans on Aggrus induced platelet aggregation, Aggrus interacted with a ligand on the platelet surface. We have preliminarily investigated the association of Aggrus with three SA-binding Ig-like lectins (Siglec) of Siglec-3, Siglec-5, and Siglec-7, which are expressed in platelets (40Bugert P. Dugrillon A. Gunaydin A. Eichler H. Kluter H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 90: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, no positive evidence has been obtained by Western blotting and flow cytometry to date (data not shown). In the next step, it will be important to determine which acceptant component on platelets is attributable to the potent activity toward aggregation by Aggrus. In conclusion, we generated a new anti-hAggrus antibody, YM-1. Then we showed that the decoration of SA on O-glycan is essential for platelet aggregation by membranous Aggrus molecules. Such data seem particularly important in light of the fact that the platelet aggregation activity is related to tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2086327820,"Overexpression of adenine nucleotide translocase-1 (ANT1) is known to induce apoptosis (Bauer, M. K., Schubert, A., Rocks, O., and Grimm, S. (1999) J. Cell Biol. 147, 1493–1501), but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study we show that ANT1 overexpression results in a recruitment of the IκBα-NF-κB complex into mitochondria, with a coincident decrease in nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity. In this situation, NF-κB transcriptionally regulated genes with antiapoptotic activity, such as Bcl-XL, MnSOD2, and c-IAP2, are down-regulated, and consequently, cells are sensitized to apoptosis. Accordingly, co-expression of p65 partially interferes with the proapoptotic effect of ANT1 overexpression. Despite the high identity of the two isoforms, overexpression of ANT2 does not exert an apoptotic effect; this lack of apoptotic activity is correlated with the absence of mitochondrial IκBα-NF-κB recruitment or changes in NF-κB activity. Thus, we propose that the mitochondrial recruitment of NF-κB observed following ANT1 overexpression has an important role in ANT1 proapoptotic activity. Overexpression of adenine nucleotide translocase-1 (ANT1) is known to induce apoptosis (Bauer, M. K., Schubert, A., Rocks, O., and Grimm, S. (1999) J.

Thus, we propose that the mitochondrial recruitment of NF-κB observed following ANT1 overexpression has an important role in ANT1 proapoptotic activity. Apoptosis is a form of cell death that plays a role in development, tissue homeostasis, and disease (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis is governed by an elaborate array of checks and balances in the cell. Studies of apoptosis induction in “in vitro” systems have demonstrated that mitochondria are required for the apoptosis stimulated by a variety of different factors (2Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar).

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Three isoforms (ANT1, ANT2, and ANT3) with tissue-specific expression patterns have been described in humans (4Doerner A. Pauschinger M. Badorff A. Noutsias M. Giessen S. Schulze K. Bilger J. Rauch U. Schultheiss H.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ANT interacts with several proteins of the outer mitochondrial membrane (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, porin/VDAC, and Bax) as well as the matrix (cyclophilin D) to form the permeability transition pore (PTP) (5Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 2141: 139-176Crossref Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). The PTP appears to be an important regulator of the apoptotic process. Opening of the pore leads to a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, Δψm, which can ultimately culminate in matrix swelling and outer membrane rupture, allowing the release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and procaspases (6Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. DiLisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 7Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I.

Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Proteins of the bcl-2 family essentially control the release of cytochrome c. Antiapoptotic members of the family (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) prevent cytochrome release, whereas the proapoptotic members Bax and Bak exert the opposite effect (8Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Faber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Bax has been shown to interact with ANT to induce PTP opening and cytochrome c release (9Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Several pharmacological compounds interfere with PTP. For instance, cyclosporin A, through its binding to cyclophilin D, prevents PTP opening, and bongkrekic acid and atractyloside are, respectively, a blocker and an inducer of apoptosis via binding of two different conformational states of ANT (10Le Quoc K. Le Quoc D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, alongside their modulation of pore formation by ANT, Bcl-2 and Bax also have been reported to influence ANT ADP/ATP antiporter activity (11Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L. Verrier F. Vandecasteele G. Cohen I. Prevost M.C. Larquet E. Pariselli F. Petit P.X. Kahn A. Rizzuto R. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 541-546PubMed Google Scholar). Although ANT is a pore component, recently it has been shown, using mitochondria lacking ANT, that this protein is not essential for MPTP activity (12Kokoszka J.E. Waymire K.G. Levy S.E. Sligh J.E. Cai J. Jones D.P. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of ANT1 (but not ANT2) can induce apoptosis (13Bauer M.K. Schubert A. Rocks O. Grimm S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); these results demonstrate the specificity of ANT in this pathway. The lack of apoptosis induction by ANT2 contrasts with the high 80% amino acid sequence identity of ANT2 with ANT1 (14Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Tanida K. Terada H. Mitochondrion. 2002; 1: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, the apoptotic activity of ANT1 appears not to depend upon its known role in ADP/ATP exchange because cell death still occurs in several transport-inactive mutants. A critical region of ANT1 (amino acids 102–141) required for apoptosis has been identified (13Bauer M.K. Schubert A. Rocks O. Grimm S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and intriguingly, this region overlaps with the Bax binding site of ANT (9Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) and contains a Vpr-binding peptide motif (15Jacotot E. Ferri K.F. El Hamel C. Brenner C. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Rustin P. Metivier D. Lenoir C. Geuskens M. Vieira V.H. Loeffler M. Belzaq A.S. Briand J.P. Zamzani N. Edelman L. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, these sites also overlap the region of ANT in which the three isoforms exhibit the highest degree of divergence, suggesting an isoform-specific regulation of ANT. Interestingly, hearts of ANT1-deficient mice exhibit a striking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (16Graham B.H. Waymire K.G. Cottrell B. Trounce I.A. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) that could be related to inhibition of apoptosis because of the lack of ANT1 expression in these animals. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a dimeric transcription factor involved in the expression of proteins necessary for innate immunity (17Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), apoptosis, and cell proliferation (18Joyce D. Albanese C. Steer J. Fu M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). NF-κB typically forms a heterodimer with the p50 and p65 (RelA) subunits and is mainly regulated by intracellular compartmentalization. The inactive form of NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm upon association with the inhibitory IκBα protein (19Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to a variety of stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), induces phosphorylation of IκBα, which allows subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor, thus leading to nuclear entry and DNA binding of NF-κB (20Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The inducible phosphorylation of IκBα is mediated by the IκB kinase complex (19Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Thus, a key step in the control of NF-κB activity is the regulation of the IκBα-NF-κB interaction. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, Bottero et al. (21Bottero V. Rossi F. Samson M. Mari M. Hofman P. Peyron J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21317-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) demonstrated an interaction between IκBα and mitochondrial ANT. Electron microscopy experiments and biochemical approaches demonstrate the presence of IκBα associated with p65(NF-κB) in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Intriguingly, NF-κB (p50) has been found in liver mitochondria, where it regulates mitochondria-specific gene expression (22Cogswell P.C. Kashatus D.F. Keifer J.A. Guttridge D.C. Reuther J.Y. Bristow C. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2963-2968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This mitochondrial gene regulation by NF-κB may control key processes involved in cell growth and apoptosis. NF-κB plays a central role in the prevention of apoptosis. The induction of antiapoptotic genes, such as Bcl-XL and the caspase inhibitors c-IAP2 and c-IAP1, is associated with nuclear NF-κB activity (23Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The scavenger enzyme superoxide dismutase MnSOD2 is also regulated by nuclear NF-κB and participates in the redox regulation that is essential for protecting cells from apoptosis (24Delhalle S. Deregowski V. Benoit V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activity by E2F1 and c-Myc has been associated with the suppression of MnSOD2 expression; this mechanism is responsible for apoptosis induction (25Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Machii T. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Recently, more complex aspects of NF-κB regulation have been proposed. For example, studies indicate that NF-κB shuttling into and out of the nucleus could play an important role in apoptosis induction (26Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis by ANT1 overexpression in transiently transfected cells. We report here that the overexpression of ANT1 (but not ANT2) potentiates the recruitment of p65(NF-κB) into the mitochondria of overexpressing cells. Subsequently, nuclear NF-κB activity diminishes the transcription of antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl-XL, MnSOD2, and IAP2. Consequently, overexpression of p65(NF-κB) is able to interfere with the proapoptotic activity of ANT1 overexpression. In summary the increase in the mitochondrial NF-κB pool induced by ANT1 overexpression plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis by ANT1. Biological Reagents and Antibodies—Antibodies against p65(NF-κB) (C-20) and against ANT (Q-18) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anticaspase-9 antibody (Asp-315) was from Cell Signaling, antiporin (VDAC) 31HL from Calbiochem (Calbiochem Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and anti-β-actin (clone AC-15) from Sigma. Human TNFα was from PeproTech EC Ltd. Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells (ATCC-CC-1) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate methods. For 6-well plates a total of 4 μg of DNA/well was used. A co-transfected GFP expression plasmid was used in a 1:10 ratio to total DNA to assess the transfection efficiency (around 80% in all cases assayed). To isolate floating cells from attached cells, the medium in the plates was gently swirled to suspend floating cells, which were then harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended with ice-cold PBS. Attached cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended with ice-cold PBS. Total cells resulted from the combination of floating and attached cells. Floating and attached cells were counted using a cytometer (Coulter Electronic Limited, Luton, UK), and the percentage of floating cells was calculated. Plasmid Constructs and cDNAs—RT-PCR was used to obtain the cDNAs for human ANT isoforms: human ANT1 (5′-primer, 5′-CCGGAATTC GAG AGC ACG AAC GGG CTG CT-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-CGCTCTAGA AGG TAT TCC TTT CAG TCT GG-3′) and human ANT2 (5′-primer, 5′-GCTCTAGAG CCG CAG CGC CGT AGT CAA A-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GCTCTAGA GTC TGT CAA GAA TGC TCA A-3′). Full-length cDNAs for each ANT isoform were cloned into the pcDNA3.1-Zeo(+) vector (Invitrogen). The human ANT1 isoform was cloned by digestion with EcoRI-XbaI; the human ANT2 isoform was cloned by XbaI-XbaI. DNA sequencing (Serveis Cientificotècnics (SCT), University of Barcelona) was used to confirm sequences. The plasmid pGFP-N3 (Clontech) was used to assess the transfection efficiency by co-transfection. An expression vector encoding the mouse NF-κB subunit p65 was a gift from P. Muñoz (Department of Physiological Sciences II, University of Barcelona). Cell Fractionation—HeLa cells were collected, washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were disrupted by 50 strokes in a glass homogenizer and then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells, plasma membranes, and nuclei. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet contained the mitochondria-enriched fraction. The supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction after it was subjected to further ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Protein was quantified using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Proteinase K Treatment—Mitochondrial extracts were incubated in homogenization buffer without protease inhibitors in the presence of 15 ng/ml proteinase K (Sigma) for 10 min on ice. Protease inhibitors were added to stop the reaction, and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described below. Immunoblotting—Homogenates and cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts of transiently transfected cells were prepared as described above. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.8% acrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk over night and then incubated with various primary antibodies (ANT (1: 100), p65 (1:4000), β-actin (1:10.000), and VDAC (1:1000). For caspase-9 analysis, cytosolic extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.8% acrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and incubated with a polyclonal antibody against cleaved caspase-9 (1: 1000). The binding of antibodies was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse (Bio-Rad 170-6516 (1:3000)), anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz sc-2004 (1:3000)), or anti-goat (Santa Cruz sc-2354 (1: 3000)) secondary antibody using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Assessment of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—The viability of transiently transfected cells was analyzed at different times after transfection of the vectors used. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry after staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) using a commercially available kit (Annexin V-FLUOS kit, Roche Applied Science). Cells were considered apoptotic when they were annexin V-positive and PI-negative. Staining of cells by PI was an indicator of the loss of plasma membrane integrity. Flow cytometry was performed using an EPICS-XL-MCL (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) cytometer. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured by flow cytometry using hexamethylindodicarbocyanine iodide (DilC1 (5Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 2141: 139-176Crossref Scopus (2199) Google Scholar)) (Molecular Probes). Transiently transfected cells were loaded with 250 ng/ml DilC1 (5Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 2141: 139-176Crossref Scopus (2199) Google Scholar) for 20 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum. At the end of the incubation the cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in a total volume of 0.5 ml of PBS, and the Δψm was analyzed by flow cytometry in a Coulter EPICS-XL-MCL (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Nuclear Extract Preparation—Extracts were prepared using a modified method from Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). For the isolation of nuclear protein extracts HeLa cells were washed with PBS, scraped off the plates in PBS, and briefly centrifuged (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 s). Cells were washed again with ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended at 4 °C in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors (5 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin/ml)). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min; then 25 μl of Nonidet P-40 (0.5%) was added, and the suspension was thoroughly mixed for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 60 s), and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors (5 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin/ml)). Nuclear lysates were maintained on ice for 15 min with occasional mixing. The nuclear extract was cleared (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), and the supernatant containing the proteins from the nuclear extract was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—HeLa cells transiently transfected with ANT1pcDNA3, ANT2pcDNA3, or empty pcDNA3 vector were used at various time points following transfection. In separate experiments HeLa cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 60 min before the cells were collected. For gel retardation assays, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus NF-κB DNA binding site (5′-TCT AGA GTT GAG GGG ACT TTC CCA G-3′, obtained from Roche Applied Science) was end-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme. Nuclear protein extracts (10 μg) were incubated for 10 min on ice with binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 mm ZnSO4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid)). The DNA probe (30,000 cpm) was added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a final volume of 25 μl. Samples were run on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA at 350 V and 4 °C for 60 min. Supershift experiments were performed by adding anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to the sample after the initial incubation and keeping the complex on ice for 10 min, followed by addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide and incubation for 20 min at room temperature. In the competition experiments, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was included. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from transiently transfected HeLa cells using the Qiagen RNA isolation kit. 5 μg of RNA was reversetranscribed into cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A total of 5 μl of cDNA was amplified in a 50-μl reaction mix using TaqDNA-polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and specific primer pairs were used. The primers used were the following: Bcl-xL (540-bp product) (5′-primer, 5′-CAG AGC AAC CGG GAG CTG GT; 3′-primer, 5′-GAT CCA AGG CTC TAG GTG GTC), MnSOD2 (505-bp product) (5′-primer, 5′-AAC GCG CAG ATC ATG CAG CTG C; 3′-primer, 5′-CCC AGT TGA TTA CAT TCC AA), c-IAP2 (567-bp product) (5′-primer, 5′-TGG GCT TTA GTA GAA GCC TGG T; 3′-primer, 5′-ACT ACT AGA TGA CCA CAA GGA A), and cyclophilin A (620-bp product) (5′-primer, 5′-GTG TAC TAT TAG CCA TGG TCA ACC C; 3′-primer, 5′-CTG CAG CGA GAG CAC AAA GAT TCT). PCR reactions were performed after 5 min of denaturation at 94 °C, repeating the cycle 1 min at 96 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. PCR products (10 μl) were analyzed in an ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gel and quantified by densitometry. Cyclophilin A was used as internal standard, and the results were corrected to this value. In an effort to understand more fully the mechanism of ANT apoptosis induction in mammalian cells, we transiently transfected cells with individual ANT1- and ANT2-encoding plasmids. First of all, we characterized the apoptotic model induced specifically by ANT1 overexpression. Comparison of the effects of overexpression of ANT1 and ANT2 in HeLa cells revealed an increase in the percent of detached and floating cells in the culture medium 24 h after transfection with an ANT1 expression construct (Fig. 1A). Overall transfection efficiency, measured by co-transfection with GFP, was about 70–80% in all transfection assays analyzed, and Western analysis, using a non-isoform-specific antibody that detects both ANT isoforms, demonstrated ANT increases in homogenate and also in mitochondria of HeLa transfected cells, indicating a correct localization of overexpressed protein in the mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 1B). To characterize the floating and attached cells we analyzed apoptotic parameters such as procaspase-9 cleavage and annexin V-FITC staining at different time points following ANT1 or ANT2 transfection. Analysis was performed in total ANT1-transfected cells or in floating cells separated from attached cells. Lysates of both populations were prepared separately as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The number of floating cells in the medium after ANT2 or vector transfection was low, and it was not possible to collect sufficient amounts to process for subsequent analysis. A significant increase in cleaved procaspase-9 was observed in total ANT1-transfected cells and also in floating and attached cells obtained after ANT1 overexpression, whereas the cleavage was negligible after ANT2 or empty vector transfection in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that caspase-9 is involved in apoptosis induced by ANT1. Fig. 2 shows changes in annexin V-FITC staining in transiently ANT1- or ANT2-transfected cells after 4 or 24 h of protein expression. Cells were considered apoptotic when they were annexin V-positive and PI-negative. As shown in Fig. 2A, the percentage of annexin V-FITC staining was similar in ANT2-transfected cells when compared with vector-transfected cells at 4 or 24 h of expression. In contrast, ANT1 overexpression resulted in increased numbers of annexin-positive cells at 4 h as well as at 24 h of overexpression. In parallel we analyzed separately floating and attached cells obtained after 4 and 24 h of ANT1 overexpression. The results indicate that almost all floating cells were annexin-positive at 4 h as well as at 24 h of expression. 24% of attached cells were annexin V-positive at 4 h, and this value decreased to 13.5% at 24 h of overexpression. The number of attached ANT1-transfected cells with annexin labeling observed at 24 h is very similar to values obtained after ANT2 or empty vector transfection. Furthermore, to assess whether caspase activation is required for induction of apoptosis by ANT1, ANT1-and vector-transfected cells were treated with the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. As shown in Fig. 2B the presence of the caspase inhibitor significantly decreased the number of annexin-positive or apoptotic cells. Flow cytometric determinations of DilC1 (5Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 2141: 139-176Crossref Scopus (2199) Google Scholar) were used to analyze changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in ANT1- and ANT2-transfected cells. Untransfected control cells treated with the chemical uncoupler CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) were used to quantify the maximum decrease of Δψm in HeLa control cells. We co-transfected ANT1 or ANT2 together with an expression vector for GFP into HeLa cells and analyzed changes in the number of cells with low Δψm after 4 h of co-expression. Fig. 3A shows that ANT1-transfected, GFP-positive cells had an increased number of cells with a decreased Δψm compared with vectortransfected, GFP-positive cells or ANT2 GFP-positive cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the increase in the number of cells with a decreased Δψm was observed in attached ANT1 cells, as well as in ANT1 floating cells. The increase in the number of cells with annexin V labeling and a low Δψm, especially in attached ANT1-transfected cells after 4 h of transfection, suggests that this increase is an early and isoform-specific effect of ANT1 overexpression. Recently it has been described that ANT binds to the IκBαNF-κB complex in mitochondria (21Bottero V. Rossi F. Samson M. Mari M. Hofman P. Peyron J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21317-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that as a result of ANT overexpression an increase of mitochondrial IκBα-NF-κB complex could be induced. We studied the mitochondrial localization of p65(NF-κB) in ANT1 or ANT2 transiently transfected cells (Fig. 4). Mitochondria were first isolated from cells and subjected to a proteinase K treatment, whose function was to hydrolyze proteins, hence allowing only NF-κB protected by mitochondrial membranes to be detected. Western blot analysis of ANT revealed an increase in expressed protein in homogenates and also in mitochondria from floating and attached HeLa cells. Expression of VDAC and β-actin was examined as a control for protein loading. Fig. 4A shows changes in p65(NF-κB) protein in homogenate, cytosol, and mitochondrial fractions from floating and attached ANT1-and empty vector-transfected cells after 24 h. Results indicated no changes in the amount of p65(NF-κB) in homogenates. Interestingly, however, a decrease in p65(NF-κB) was observed in the cytosol alongside an increase in the mitochondria from floating cells. Attached cells obtained after 24 h of overexpression did not show changes either in mitochondrial p65(NF-κB) or in cytosolic p65(NF-κB) levels despite ANT 1 overexpression in mitochondria. These results, indicating mitochondrial NF-κB recruitment, are in agreement with the annexin labeling obtained after 24 h of overexpression in that the results are high in floating cells and low in attached cells. In experiments using ANT2 or empty vector transfection no floating cells were obtained (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 4B, ANT2 transient transfection did not grossly alter the p65(NF-κB) levels in mitochondria, homogenate, or cytosol of HeLa transfected cells. The increase of NF-κB localization in mitochondria from HeLa ANT1-transfected cells thus seems to be specific to ANT1 overexpression and could lead to a decrease in nuclear NF-κB activity. To verify the NF-κB nuclear binding activity following transient transfection of ANT1 or ANT2, we analyzed nuclear extracts"
https://openalex.org/W2025810459,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest and most diverse family of cell surface receptors. Several GPCRs have been documented to dimerize with resulting changes in pharmacology and signaling. We have previously reported, by means of photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (pbFRET) microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopic analysis in live cells, that human somatostatin receptor (hSSTR) 5 could both homodimerize and heterodimerize with hSSTR1 in the presence of the agonist SST-14. By contrast, hSSTR1 remained monomeric when expressed alone regardless of agonist exposure in live cells. However, the effect of the agonist on other hSSTR members remains unknown. Using pbFRET microscopy and Western blot, we provide evidence for agonist-dependent dissociation of self-associated hSSTR2 stably expressed in CHO-K1 and HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, the dissociation of the hSSTR2 dimer occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, blocking receptor dissociation using a cross-linker agent perturbed receptor trafficking. Taking these data together, we suggest that the process of GPCR dimerization may operate differently, even among members of the same family, and that receptor dissociation as well as dimerization may be important steps for receptor dynamics.

Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). The initial notion that GPCRs are present on the membrane as monomeric entities in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with their G-protein has since been reinterpreted. Several studies have shown by using a combination of techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) that at least some GPCRs assemble on the membrane as functional homo- and heterodimers (2Agnati L.F. Ferré S. Lluis C. Franco R. Fuxe K. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 509-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Dimerization of GPCRs has been shown to affect a multitude of receptor functions, including ligand binding, signaling, receptor desensitization, and receptor trafficking (2Agnati L.F. Ferré S.

One model suggests that ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that favors dimer formation. In contrast to this model, the presence of GPCRs, which may be assembled as preformed dimers, has been shown for members of the class C subfamily, which includes GABAergic receptors (6White J.H.

Recently, we have demonstrated agonist-dependent homo- and heterodimers on the plasma membrane in live cells using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (16Patel R.C. Kumar U. Lamb D.C. Eid J.S.

One of the receptor subtypes, hSSTR1, did not form homodimers in either the absence or presence of agonist, in contrast to hSSTR5, which showed robust dimerization on agonist exposure. When both receptors were co-expressed in the same cell, two populations of dimers were observed, hSSTR5 homodimers and hSSTR1/hSSTR5 heterodimers (16Patel R.C. Kumar U. Lamb D.C. Eid J.S.

The effect of agonist on other members of the hSSTR family is currently unknown.In the present study using both Western blot and pbFRET analysis, we determined the effect of agonist on hSSTR2 dimerization. We show that agonist induced a dissociation of preassembled hSSTR2 dimers in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was inhibited when cell membranes were pretreated with a cross-linking agent. hSSTR2 undergoes internalization on exposure to agonist, however, inhibition of dimer dissociation resulted in impaired receptor internalization. Finally, our data provide evidence suggesting that agonist-dependent dissociation of self-associated dimers may be a requirement for proper receptor trafficking.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The peptides SST-14 and [Leu8-d-Trp22, Tyr25]SST-28 (LTT-SST-28) were purchased from Bachem, Torrance, CA. Fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated and non-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA) (12CA5) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse affinity-purified secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA. The cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was purchased from Sigma.SSTR Constructs and Expressing Cell Lines—Stable CHO-K1 and HEK-293 cells expressing HA-tagged hSSTR2 were prepared by LipofectAMINE transfection reagent as described previously (15Rocheville M.

In brief, CHO-K1 cells expressing HA-hSSTR2 were treated with different concentrations (0, 10–10, 5 × 10–9, 10–7, and 10–6m) of agonist for 10 min at 37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min on ice, and processed for immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies conjugated to FITC and rhodamine for the donor and acceptor, respectively, before being subjected to pbFRET analysis. The effective FRET efficiency (E) was calculated from the average photobleaching time constant of the donor obtained in the absence (τavg D–A) and presence (τavg D+A) of the acceptor, according to the equation E = 1 – (τD–A/τD+A) × 100.Western Blot Analysis—Membranes from HA-hSSTR2 stably transfected in HEK-293 cells were prepared using a glass homogenizer in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, as described previously (15Rocheville M.

The membrane pellet was washed and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the absence of dithiothreitol. Membrane protein (50 μg) was treated with SST-14 (0, 10–10, 10–8, and 10–6m) in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 37 °C. When the cross-linking agent BS3 was used, membranes were pretreated with 5 mm BS3 for 1 h at 4 °C, and this reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 4 °C. After treatment with SST-14, membrane protein was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 710 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). The sample was heated at 85 °C for 5 min before being fractionated by electrophoresis on a SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel. The fractionated proteins were transferred by electrophoresis to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot transfer medium, Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was blotted with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (dilution, 1:5000). Blocking of membrane, incubation of primary antibodies, incubation of secondary antibodies, and detection by chemiluminescence were performed following WesternBreeze® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were captured using an Alpha Innotech FluorChem 8800 (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA) gel box imager, and densitometry was carried out using FluorChem software (Alpha Innotech Co.).Internalization by Radioligand and Immunocytochemistry—Receptor internalization was assessed as described previously (32Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-hSSTR2 were cultured in 6-well plates to ∼90% confluency (∼1.5 × 106 cells/well). On the day of the experiment, medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% bacitracin) with 125I-LTT-SST-28 (200,000 cpm) with or without 1 μm SST-14 to account for nonspecific binding. Cells were washed two times in D-PBS and warmed to 37 °C for various times (0, 15, 30, 60 min) to initiate internalization. For cross-linking experiments, cells were pretreated with 1 mm BS3 in D-PBS for 1 h at 4 °C, and this reaction was terminated by washing the cells first with D-PBS followed by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 4 °C. Surface-bound radioligand was removed with 1 ml of acid wash buffer (20 mm NaOAc in 1× Hanks' solution, pH 5.0) for 10 min. Internalized radioligand was measured as acid-resistant counts taken after removing cells with 1 ml of 1 n NaOH. Radioactive fractions were quantified for radioactivity using an LKB gamma counter (LKB-Wallach, Turku, Finland). Each experiment was performed three times in triplicate.For internalization by immunocytochemistry, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-hSSTR2 were grown on coverslips and treated with SST-14 (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. When the cross-linker agent was indicated, cells were treated with 1 mm BS3 for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of SST-14. Reaction was terminated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed two times in D-PBS and fixed for 20 min at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde. After three subsequent washes in D-PBS, cells were incubated in 5% normal goat serum in D-PBS for 1 h followed by incubation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000) in 1% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Unless indicated, permeabilization of cells was performed using 0.2% Triton X-100 in D-PBS for 10 min followed by three washes in D-PBS prior to incubation with antibody. Cells were then washed three times in D-PBS followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:800) for 1 h. After two washes in D-PBS, cells were mounted and viewed under a Leica DML microscope attached to a Cool Snap CCD camera.RESULTSLigand-dependent Dissociation of hSSTR2 Homodimers by pbFRET and Western Blot—CHO-K1 cells were stably expressed with an N-terminal HA-tagged hSSTR2 (Bmax = 435 ± 33 fmol/mg of protein, KD = 0.3 ± 0.1 nm). Cells were treated with different concentrations of SST-14 and processed for hSSTR2 localization to study by pbFRET microscopy. pbFRET microscopy was determined by the photobleaching decay of donor on the cell surface by using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies conjugated with either fluorescein (donor) or rhodamine (acceptor). As shown in Fig. 1A, in the basal state, the cell surface presented with a high relative FRET efficiency, suggesting the presence of homodimers, compared with SST-14-treated cells. Treatment with SST-14 induced a concentration-dependent decrease in FRET efficiency from a maximum of 11.7 ± 1.1% under basal conditions to 2.1 ± 0.9% with 1 μm SST-14 (Table I and Fig. 1A). Our data indicate that unlike hSSTR1 and hSSTR5, hSSTR2 is self-associated and dissociates on agonist activation. Because FRET is sensitive to distance, changes in FRET efficiency can be perceived as either dissociation of dimers or changes in receptor conformation. To confirm whether ligand-activated hSSTR2 is associated with changes in dimer to monomer formation, we performed Western blot.Table IConcentration-dependent decrease in FRET efficienciesSST-14 concentrationτavgnEControlD - A13.6 ± 0.348D + A15.4 ± 0.34811.7 ± 1.110-10D - A13.2 ± 0.348D + A14.0 ± 0.4485.7 ± 1.35 × 10-9D - A13.4 ± 0.448D + A13.8 ± 0.2482.9 ± 1.210-7D - A14.1 ± 0.348D + A14.3 ± 0.3481.4 ± 1.110-6D - A14.2 ± 0.448D + A14.5 ± 0.2482.1 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab Membranes from HEK-293 cells stably expressing HA-hSSTR2 (Bmax = 2608 ± 206 fmol/mg of protein, KD = 0.4 ± 0.1 nm), which were chosen for their higher expression levels, were treated with various concentrations of SST-14 before being processed for Western blot. In the absence of agonist, hSSTR2 was present in both dimeric (120 kDa) and monomeric (60 kDa) forms (Fig. 1B). Treatment of hSSTR2 membrane with SST-14 induced a concentration-dependent decrease in dimer formation (Fig. 1B). Increasing concentrations of SST-14 gradually decreased the ratio of hSSTR2 dimers to monomers (Fig. 1C). Dissociation of the dimeric complex could be prevented when membranes were pretreated with the cross-linking agent BS3 (Fig. 1D). Western blot in combination with pbFRET analysis supports the notion that hSSTR2 is a self-associated dimer under basal conditions, but on ligand activation, it preferentially dissociates into monomers. It is unclear why there was an appreciable amount of monomeric receptor found by Western blot. One reason could be the result of a solubilization artifact, because receptor dimers can be affected by the concentration of detergent used. Another reason could be the higher expression levels achieved in HEK-293 cells compared with those in CHO-K1 cells used to perform Western blot. Perhaps the monomeric receptors represent an immature intracellular pool that is only functional when the receptors are in dimeric form and are present at the cell surface. With the exception of the δ-OR (29Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), little has been shown to support the functional significance for the dissociation of GPCR dimers. To determine whether dissociation of the dimeric complex is associated with changes in receptor properties, we proceeded to investigate receptor internalization.Internalization of hSSTR2—CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-hSSTR2 were grown on coverslips and treated with 1 μm SST-14 for 30 min with or without prior treatment of BS3. Because BS3 is a hydrophilic lipid impermeable cross-linking agent and was shown to inhibit agonist-induced hSSTR2 dissociation (Fig. 1D), only dimeric receptors at the cell surface would be affected on treatment. Under basal conditions, hSSTR2 was mainly localized at the cell surface with little or no cytoplasmic localization of receptor in permeabilized cells (Fig. 2A, left panels). Treatment with SST-14 (1 μm) resulted in the internalization of hSSTR2 with decreases in cell surface expression (Fig. 2A, middle panels). Internalization of receptor was appreciably inhibited when cells were treated with the cross-linker prior to the exposure of SST-14 (Fig. 2A, right panels). Thus, we demonstrate that internalization of hSSTR2 can be inhibited when receptor dissociation is blocked. To determine whether receptor internalization was either completely blocked or delayed, we measured internalization kinetics.Fig. 2Internalization of hSSTR2. A, immunocytochemistry of CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-hSSTR2 in the absence (Control) or presence of 1 μm SST-14 with or without pretreatment of 1 mm BS3.

We used the radioligand 125I-LTT-SST-28, an agonist to hSSTR2, to measure internalization kinetics. Receptor binding was not inhibited on treatment with BS3. A maximum internalization was achieved at ∼30 min, when measured up to 1 h. This internalization rate was significantly altered when cells were pre-treated with BS3, consistent with the immunocytochemistry results that inhibition of dimer dissociation impairs receptor trafficking (Fig. 2B).DISCUSSIONThe mechanisms underlying dimerization have become paramount in the elucidation of GPCR function. There are two general models that have been proposed for the dimerization of GPCRs that have resulted in contentious debate (for reviews see Refs. 2Agnati L.F. Ferré S. Lluis C. Franco R. Fuxe K. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 509-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

One model states that GPCRs are preassembled dimeric complexes occurring early following their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, without any ensuing effect on ligand treatment in altering the dimeric state of the receptor. An example that has been well documented in this regard is the GABAB receptor, a relative of the class C subfamily of GPCRs (6White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A.

Bettler B. Nature. 1998; 396: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). In this example, the heterodimerization between the GABABR1 and GABABR2 receptor subtypes was shown to be a prerequisite for the proper trafficking and functioning at the cell surface (6White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 7Jones K.A Borowsky B.

Bettler B. Nature. 1998; 396: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The other model states a ligand dependence for GPCR dimerization and has been documented for several GPCRs; therefore, a ligand-independent constitutive receptor dimerization paradigm cannot be universally accepted for all receptors (2Agnati L.F. Ferré S. Lluis C. Franco R. Fuxe K. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 509-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In fact, there have been conflicting reports on the same receptor subtype, concerning its dimerization properties, as to whether or not ligand has a direct effect. Cvejic and Devi (29Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) have reported that ligand-activated mouse δ-OR causes dissociation of receptor dimers to monomers in stably transfected cells using co-immunoprecipitation. On the contrary, Milligan and co-workers (33McVey M. Ramsay D. Kellett E. Rees S. Wilson S. Pope A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) found that the human δ-OR displayed constitutive dimerization irrespective of ligand occupancy, using both bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and FRET techniques in transiently transfected cells. Whether these discrepancies are caused by the types of techniques used, transfections, or the species of receptor used is uncertain. In a recent report, transiently transfected cells resulted in the formation of mostly dimeric immature intracellular human lutropin receptors that exhibited no effect on ligand treatment (34Tao Y.X.

https://openalex.org/W2044474218,"U-box proteins, as well as other proteins involved in regulated protein degradation, are apparently over-represented in Arabidopsis compared with other model eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis protein AtPUB14 contains a typical U-box domain followed by an Armadillo repeat region, a domain organization that is frequently found in plant U-box proteins. In vitro ubiquitination assays demonstrated that AtPUB14 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase with specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The structure of the AtPUB14 U-box domain was determined by NMR spectroscopy. It adopts the ββαβ fold of the Prp19p U-box and RING finger domains. In these proteins, conserved hydrophobic residues form a putative E2-binding cleft. By contrast, they contain no common polar E2 binding site motif. Two hydrophobic cores stabilize the AtPUB14 U-box fold, and hydrogen bonds and salt bridges interconnect the residues corresponding to zinc ion-coordinating residues in RING domains. Residues from a C-terminal α-helix interact with the core domain and contribute to stabilization. The Prp19p U-box lacks a corresponding C-terminal α-helix. Chemical shift analysis suggested that aromatic residues exposed at the N terminus and the C-terminal α-helix of the AtPUB14 U-box participate in dimerization. Thus, AtPUB14 may form a biologically relevant dimer. This is the first plant U-box structure to be determined, and it provides a model for studies of the many plant U-box proteins and their interactions. Structural insight into these interactions is important, because ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is a prevalent regulatory mechanism in plants.

Structural insight into these interactions is important, because ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is a prevalent regulatory mechanism in plants. The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway plays an important role in regulated protein degradation (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). Proteins designated for degradation are covalently modified by attachment of a ubiquitin polymer and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. A ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; E4, ubiquitin chain assembly factor; ARM, armadillo; CHIP, carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. catalyzes ATP-dependent formation of a thioester bond between ubiquitin and itself and transfers the activated ubiquitin to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Formation of an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and a substrate is facilitated by a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) that can bind both the E2-ubiquitin complex and the substrate. Members of the HECT and RING protein families are the best characterized E3 ligases, but recently U-box proteins have also been shown to function as E3s (2Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 3Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). This may be the general function of U-box proteins, although they were initially suggested to function as ubiquitin chain assembly factors (E4s) (4Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Recently, research on U-box proteins, especially the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting proteins (CHIP), has focused on their ability to interact with molecular chaperones and selectively ubiquitinate unfolded proteins. Thus ubiquitination can also function in protein quality control (5Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The U-box motif is a peptide chain that contains ∼70 amino acid residues, with characteristics suggesting that it is a structural variant of the RING fold but lacks the signature zinc-binding amino acids of the RING domain (6Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Recently, the first three-dimensional structure of a U-box domain was published (7Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Chazin W.J. Gould K.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The structure of the yeast pre-mRNA splicing factor Prp19p U-box was determined by NMR spectroscopy and verified the structural similarity to the RING domain stabilized by an extensive hydrogen-bonding network as a replacement for the zinc binding sites of the RING domains. Only two U-box proteins are present in yeast, and typically six are present in animals (5Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). By contrast, Arabidopsis contains many U-box proteins (8Azevedo C. Santos-Rosa M.J. Shirasu K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The largest class of Arabidopsis U-box proteins contains an ARMADILLO (ARM) repeat region linked to the U-box. ARM repeats are short leucine-rich protein-interacting motifs (9Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), first identified in the segment polarity protein, armadillo, from Drosophila melanogaster (10Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Only a few plant U-box proteins have been characterized biochemically, and so far three-dimensional structures have not been available. The Brassica U-box protein ARC1 binds to the S-locus receptor kinase, the female determinant of pollen self-incompatibility (11Takasaki T. Hatakeyama K. Suzuki G. Watanabe M. Isogai A. Hinata K. Nature. 2000; 403: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), via its ARM repeats (12Gu T. Mazzurco M. Sulaman W. Matias D.D. Goring D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It was suggested that ARC1 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of compatibility factors in the pistil leading to pollen rejection (13Stone S.L. Anderson E.M. Mullen R.T. Goring D.R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 885-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis also contains a CHIP orthologue that functions as an E3 in vitro (14Yan J. Wang J. Li Q. Hwang J.R. Patterson C. Zhang H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). AtCHIP is up-regulated by certain stress conditions and overexpression of AtCHIP rendered Arabidopsis more sensitive to both low and high temperatures, suggesting a link between protein ubiquitination and stress responses in plants. Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation has been shown to play important roles in plant growth and development (15Hare P.D. Seo H.S. Yang J.Y. Chua N.H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The abundance of U-box proteins, their ability to interact functionally with E2 enzymes to ubiquitinate protein substrates (16Mudgil Y. Shiu S.H. Stone S.L. Salt J.N. Goring D.R.

A full-length AtPUB14 fragment was also cloned into pET30a (Novagen) using the primers 5′-GGGAATTCATGGGATTAACGAATTGT and 5′-ATTTATCTCGAGTTATGGAACAGTAGTTAC to produce AtPUB14 with an N-terminal histidine tag. The fusion proteins that were used for ubiquitination assays were purified by affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, New England Biolabs, or Qiagen). For production and purification of recombinant protein for structure determination, AtPUB14-(249-321)-GST was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), grown in minimal medium (M9 minimal medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin, 3 g/liter (15NH4)2SO2 and 4 g/liter [13C6]glucose or [12C6]glucose) at 37 °C for 16-18 h and then diluted 1:100 in labeled minimal medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.6-0.7 was reached. After induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was incubated at 15 °C for 16-18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 7,000 × g and lysed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Miles-Seravac) by sonication. Insoluble cell material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm HA filter (MilliPore). The fusion protein was allowed to bind to a glutathione-Sepha-rose column, and the column was washed with phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT) and subsequently with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The column was incubated with Tris buffer supplemented with 10 mm ATP and 5 mm MgSO4 for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed extensively with Tris buffer to elute E. coli chaperone Dnak. Using 25 units of bovine thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) per milligram of fusion protein, the protease was dissolved in Tris buffer supplemented with 2.5 mm CaCl2, and the fusion protein was cleaved on-column for 2 h at room temperature. Cleaved AtPUB14-(249-321) protein was eluted, pooled, and separated from thrombin by benzami-dine affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted protein was concentrated, and the buffer was changed to phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT) using Amicon Centriprep (Millipore). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE were used to examine the purity of the protein. The final product contained five additional N-terminal residues, GSPEF. However, the protein used for the NMR analysis will be referred to only as PUB14-(249-321). Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of Expression—Arabidopsis plants were grown in a greenhouse at 21 °C with 18-h light and 6-h darkness. Tissues were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated by LiCl precipitation, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation followed by DNase treatment in a reaction coupled to RT using oligo(dT) primers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. 1 μg of mRNA was used, and 5% of the cDNA products were used for PCR amplification. Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase was used for PCR in the following PCR program: 30 min at 95 °C, then 30× (45 s at 94 °C, then 45 s at 45 °C, then 3 min at 72 °C), then 15 min at 72 °C. The primer sets were 5′-GTTTCACATCAACATTGTGGTCATTGG and 5′-GAGTACTTGGGGTAGTGGCATCC for EF1α (elongation factor, constitutively expressed control) and 5′-CCTCGGACTCAGGAACAT and 5′-TCATGGAACAGTAGTTAC for AtPUB14. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—The assays were performed essentially as described previously (21Seo H.S. Yang J.Y. Ishikawa M. Bolle C. Ballesteros M.L. Chua N.H. Nature. 2003; 424: 995-999Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 0.5 μg of recombinant protein, 20 ng of rabbit E1 and E2 (UbcH5b or UbcH13, Boston Biochemicals), and 10 μg of His6-ubiquitin (Sigma) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris at pH 7.4, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. When indicated the mixture also contained 1 μl of E. coli extract. The reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C and analyzed by Western blot. NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignments—Samples for NMR spectroscopy typically contained 0.6 mm PUB14-(249-321), 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% or 99.96% D2O (v/v), pH 7.5. NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C using Varian Unity Inova 750 or 800 spectrometers. For resonance assignment 15N-1H HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, 15N-TOCSY/NOESY-HSQC, HCCH-TOCSY, 13C-NOESY-HSQC, and (HB)CB(CGCD)HD spectra were recorded using the standard set-up provided by ProteinPack. The spectra were processed using NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Pronto3D (23Kjær M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 288-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Autoassign (24Zimmerman D.E. Kulikowski C.A. Huang Y. Feng W. Tashiro M. Shimotakahara S. Chien C. Powers R. Montelione G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 592-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) was used to assign the backbone atoms. These assignments were confirmed by interactive computer spectrum analysis. Torsion angle restraints were derived from database matching using TALOS (25Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Inter-residue NOEs were automatically assigned by CYANA (26Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) and checked by computer-assisted spectrum inspection. Structures of PUB14-(249-321) were calculated using standard XPLOR-simulated annealing protocols (27Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Software Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and iteratively analyzed for violations of experimental constraints. Finally, 200 structures were calculated of which none had NOE violations of >0.5 Å and angle violations of >5°. From these, the 30 lowest energy structures were chosen for water refinement using CNS (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). After the water refinement, none of the 30 structures had NOE violations of >0.4 Å and angle violations of >5°. From the sample of 30 water-refined structures an ensemble of 20 structures comprising those with the lowest number of violations and with the lowest energy was chosen to represent the PUB14-(249-321) U-box structure. These structures were analyzed and checked using Procheck-NMR (29Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), XPLOR (27Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Software Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), WHAT-IF (30Vried G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 78: 713-730Google Scholar), and NACCESS (31Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS computer program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London1993Google Scholar). For a comparison of related structures a set of six RING structures and one U-box structure was selected using CE (32Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein. Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar) and MODELLER 6.2 (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar). The selection criterion was an alignment of more than 80% of their Cα atoms within 2.5 Å of the structure of PUB14-(249-321). For the structures in the sets determined by NMR spectroscopy, only model 1 was used for comparison. The structures were displayed using the molecular graphics computer programs Web Lab Viewer and MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wutrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). PG-SLED NMR Experiments—To a 1.1 mm15N/13C-labeled PUB14-(249-321) sample in 99.6% (v/v) D2O was added 0.07% 1,4-dioxan (Fluka). The Stokes radius of the U-box was determined as described previously (35Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochem. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). HYDROPRO Prediction of the Stokes Radius—HYDROPRO was used to compute the Stokes radius of the calculated PUB14-(249-321) U-box structure (36de la Torre J.G. Huertas M.L. Carrasco H.B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The three lowest energy structures of the ensemble of 20 structures representing the PUB14-(249-321) U-box were used for the calculations, and an average of the three resulting Stokes radii was calculated. Standard parameters were used, and molecular mass and temperature were set to 8754 Da and 298 K, respectively. Coordinates—The coordinates for each of the 20 structures in the selected ensemble of PUB14-(249-321) U-box structures together with all NMR assignments have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1T1H. Arabidopsis U-box Proteins—The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes for many U-box proteins (8Azevedo C. Santos-Rosa M.J. Shirasu K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To select a representative U-box protein for structural and functional studies we analyzed the Arabidopsis genome for predicted U-box proteins using BLAST (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) homology searches and keyword searches of the SMART (19Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and InterPro (18Mulder N.J. Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Barrell D. Bateman A. Binns D. Biswas M. Bradley P.

Silventoinen V. Orchard S.E. Pagni M. Peyruc D. Ponting C.P. Selengut J.D. Servant F. Sigrist C.J. Vaughan R Zdobnov E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) protein domain databases. This analysis uncovered 62 Arabidopsis proteins with a U-box domain and domain compositions as shown in Fig. 1a. The SMART, BLAST, and InterPro analyses showed that a large fraction of these proteins contains one or more ARM repeat regions (9Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Many of the proteins identified by the search also contain an ∼200 amino acid residue N-terminal domain recently named UND (U-box N-terminal domain (16Mudgil Y. Shiu S.H. Stone S.L. Salt J.N. Goring D.R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)). AtPUB14, a Model Arabidopsis U-box Protein—The sequences of the Arabidopsis U-box domains are highly conserved (Fig. 1b) (8Azevedo C. Santos-Rosa M.J. Shirasu K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the sequence similarity extends beyond the C-terminal border of the Prp19p U-box fragment of known tertiary structure (7Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Chazin W.J. Gould K.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This makes structure determination of a typical Arabidopsis U-box domain important. The 632-amino acid residue Arabidopsis AtPUB14 protein (8Azevedo C. Santos-Rosa M.J. Shirasu K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was selected for structure studies, because it contains a typical Arabidopsis U-box domain (Fig. 1b) and has a domain architecture consisting of a UND domain (16Mudgil Y. Shiu S.H. Stone S.L. Salt J.N. Goring D.R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) followed by a U-box domain and several ARM repeats (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, based on the number of available expressed sequence tag clones the AtPUB14 gene is relatively well expressed compared with other U-box genes. This was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of different Arabidopsis tissues, which suggested that the AtPUB14 gene is expressed in several tissues, including flowers, green siliques, seeds, and rosettes (Fig. 2). The structure of the complex between the RING domain from c-Cbl and the E2 UbcH7 (37Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Payletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) serves as a model for interactions between RING domain E3 and E2 enzymes. According to this, Ile383 and Trp408 of c-Cbl form a hydrophobic groove that interacts with a phenylalanine in UbcH7, and Trp408 is involved in determining the specificity of the E2/E3 interactions (37Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Payletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Identical amino acids are present in corresponding positions in the ATPUB14 U-box domain and in many of the Arabidopsis U-box domains (Fig. 1b) (8Azevedo C. Santos-Rosa M.J. Shirasu K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis U-box domains also contain a proline in a position that is part of the hydrophobic E2 interaction surface of c-Cbl. These similarities suggest that AtPUB14 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Activity of AtPUB14—The ability of AtPUB14 to mediate ubiquitination was examined in vitro. The full-length AtPUB14 recombinant fusion proteins, GST-PUB14-(1-632), MBP-PUB14-(1-632), or histidine-tagged AtPUB14-(1-632), were expressed mostly in the insoluble fraction of E. coli. However, N-terminally truncated versions of AtPUB14 fused to GST (GST-PUB14-(249-632)) or MBP (MBP-PUB14-(219-632)) were soluble and contained putative substrate-binding ARM repeats. For the assays GST-PUB14-(249-632) was incubated with recombinant ubiquitin, rabbit E1, and human recombinant E2 (UbcH5b or UbcH13) in the presence of E. coli proteins. UbcH5b was used, because it interacts functionally with several U-box and RING proteins (3Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 21Seo H.S. Yang J.Y. Ishikawa M. Bolle C. Ballesteros M.L. Chua N.H. Nature. 2003; 424: 995-999Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The reactions were probed by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin or anti-GST antibodies for the detection. When the reaction mixture contained E. coli proteins and was analyzed using anti-ubiquitin antibodies, GST-PUB14-(249-632) mediated ubiquitination of protein substrates in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3a). This modification was dependent on both ubiquitin, ATP, an E1, the type of E2, and GST-PUB14-(249-632). UbcH5b, but not UbcH13, functioned with GST-PUB14-(249-632) showing that AtPUB14 requires a specific E2 for activity. In addition, the results showed that the UND domain is not required for in vitro ubiquitination activity of the Arabidopsis UND/U-box/ARM proteins, as suggested previously (16Mudgil Y. Shiu S.H. Stone S.L. Salt J.N. Goring D.R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Auto-ubiquitination—E3s often undergo auto-ubiquitination, and auto-ubiquitination of U-box proteins has also been reported (2Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of GST-PUB14-(249-632) to undergo auto-ubiquitination was examined. When detection was performed using an antibody against GST, a substantial proportion of the 68-kDa GST-PUB14-(249-632) protein exhibited a shift in electrophoretic mobility toward the top of the gel indicative of polyubiquitination. This reconfirmed the ability of the U-box domain to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Structure Determination of the PUB14-(249-321) U-box Domain by NMR Spectroscopy—The ability of AtPUB14 to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase has made structure determination of its U-box domain important for an in-depth understanding of how this function is executed. Analysis of the NMR spectra of PUB14-(249-321) U-box resulted in the assignment of the NMR signals from more than 95% of the NMR active nuclei in the peptide backbone and the amino acid side chains. A total of 1083 non-redundant NOEs was assigned and applied in the structure calculations together with 88 backbone dihedral angle constraints derived from secondary chemical shift database mining using TALOS (Table I). The PUB14-(249-321) U-box domain has a well defined structure in the region between residues Tyr251 and Glu321. The 20 structures of this part of the U-box domain superimpose well with an r.m.s.d. to the average structure of 0.58 ± 0.13Å for the backbone atoms and 1.0 ± 0.1 Å for all heavy atoms, and for the entire ensemble 98.2% of the (φ, ψ) angle combinations fall in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table I).Table ISummary of restraint"
https://openalex.org/W2107618173,"Ethanol is teratogenic to many vertebrates. We are utilizing zebrafish as a model system to determine whether there is an association between ethanol metabolism and ethanol-mediated developmental toxicity. Here we report the isolation and characterization of two cDNAs encoding zebrafish alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Phylogenetic analysis of these zebrafish ADHs indicates that they share a common ancestor with mammalian class I, II, IV, and V ADHs. The genes encoding these zebrafish ADHs have been named Adh8a and Adh8b by the nomenclature committee. Both genes were genetically mapped to chromosome 13. The 1450-bp Adh8a is 82, 73, 72, and 72% similar at the amino acid level to the Baltic cod ADH8 (previously named ADH1), the human ADH1B2, the mouse ADH1, and the rat ADH1, respectively. Also, the 1484-bp Adh8b is 77, 68, 67, and 66% similar at the amino acid level to the Baltic cod ADH8, the human ADH1B2, the mouse ADH1, and the rat ADH1, respectively. ADH8A and ADH8B share 86% amino acid similarity. To characterize the functional properties of ADH8A and ADH8B, recombinant proteins were purified from SF-9 insect cells. Kinetic studies demonstrate that ADH8A metabolizes ethanol, with a Vmax of 13.4 nmol/min/mg protein, whereas ADH8B does not metabolize ethanol. The ADH8A Km for ethanol as a substrate is 0.7 mm. 4-Methyl pyrazole, a classical competitive inhibitor of class I ADH, failed to inhibit ADH8A. ADH8B has the capacity to efficiently biotransform longer chain primary alcohols (≥5 carbons) and S-hydroxymethlyglutathione, whereas ADH8A does not efficiently metabolize these substrates. Finally, mRNA expression studies indicate that both ADH8A and ADH8B mRNA are expressed during early development and in the adult brain, fin, gill, heart, kidney, muscle, and liver. Together these results indicate that class I-like ADH is conserved in zebrafish, albeit with mixed functional properties. Ethanol is teratogenic to many vertebrates.

Fetal alcohol syndrome in children born to women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy was first described by Jones and colleagues in 1973 (1Jones K.L. Smith D.W. Lancet. 1973; 2: 999-1001Abstract Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by a delay in development, cardiac abnormalities (1Jones K.L. Smith D.W. Lancet. 1973; 2: 999-1001Abstract Scopus (2137) Google Scholar), central nervous abnormalities, abnormal craniofacial features, and intellectual delays (1Jones K.L. Smith D.W. Lancet. 1973; 2: 999-1001Abstract Scopus (2137) Google Scholar, 2Henderson G.I. Chen J.J. Schenker S. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D541-D550PubMed Google Scholar). The teratogenic properties of ethanol have been firmly established; however, the underlying mechanism(s) of toxicity remain unclear. Two molecular mechanisms have been proposed: direct ethanol effects and the indirect effects associated with acetaldehyde formation and oxidative stress (3Reynolds J.D. Brien J.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ability of ethanol to cause developmental anomalies has been demonstrated in mice, rats, Drosophila melanogaster, and chickens (4Becker H.C. Diaz-Granados J.L. Randall C.L. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1996; 55: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Pierce D.R. Goodlett C.R. West J.R. Teratology. 1989; 40: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Bupp Becker S.R.

Dev. 1996; 6: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Zebrafish embryos exposed to ethanol display craniofacial abnormalities, cardiac and structural malformations, and development delay (9Reimers M.J. Flockton A.M. Tanguay R.L. Neurotoxicol.

Hardesty H.R. Sutherland S.E. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 2002; 24: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that three adult strains of zebrafish display different behaviors in response to ethanol exposure, reflecting underlying genetic differences (13Dlugos C.A. Rabin R.A. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2003; 74: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Whether ethanol metabolism is involved in producing these ethanol-dependent endpoints in zebrafish remains unknown. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) 1The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; 12-HDDA, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid; HMGSH, S-hydroxymethylglutathione; 4-MP, 4-methyl pyrazole. metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde. ADHs are zinc-containing cytosolic enzymes that consist of two ∼40-kDa subunits (14Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). From mammalian studies, several classes of ADHs have been characterized (for nomenclature, see, on the World Wide Web, www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/ADH.shtml). Class I ADHs (ADH1) have low Km values for ethanol and are responsible for the metabolism of ethanol and other small chain alcohols (15Crabb D.W. Bosron W.F. Li T.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Boleda M.D. Julia P. Moreno A. Pares X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Pyrazole or 4-methyl pyrazole inhibits class I ADHs (15Crabb D.W. Bosron W.F. Li T.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17McMartin K.E. Collins T.D. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 1988; 26: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Class II ADH isozymes (ADH4) have higher Km values toward ethanol (15Crabb D.W. Bosron W.F. Li T.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Boleda M.D. Julia P. Moreno A. Pares X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 14Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and tend to metabolize larger aliphatic and aromatic alcohols/aldehydes (reviewed in Refs. 14Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 18Agarwal D.P. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2001; 49: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Importantly, ADH4s are less sensitive than class I enzymes to inhibition by pyrazole derivatives (reviewed in Refs. 14Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 18Agarwal D.P. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2001; 49: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Class III ADH (ADH5), also known as glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (reviewed in Refs. 19Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 20Danielsson O. Jornvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9247-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Duester G. Farres J. Felder M.R. Holmes R.S. Hoog J.O. Pares X. Plapp B.V. Yin S.J. Jornvall H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), preferentially metabolize longer chain aliphatic (longer than butanol) and aromatic alcohols; these activities are not inhibited by pyrazole derivatives (19Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Class III enzymes cannot be saturated by ethanol (reviewed in Refs. 18Agarwal D.P. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2001; 49: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Class IV (ADH7) enzymes have a lower Km for retinoids and can metabolize ethanol at higher Km and Vmax values than class I (22Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Class V and VI ADHs have not been thoroughly investigated for substrate specificity and functionality (23Hoog J. Brandt M. Hedberg J.J. Stromberg P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of two zebrafish alcohol dehydrogenases. Based on deduced amino acid sequence analysis, phylogenetic comparisons, genetic mapping, and the metabolic properties of this protein, we have classified ADH8A as a functional zebrafish class I alcohol dehydrogenase. However, ADH8B is classified as a zebrafish class I alcohol dehydrogenase based on phylogenetic analysis, but it does not function as a typical class I enzyme. The zebrafish alcohol dehydrogenase was named in accordance with the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee for Gene Family Nomenclature on Alcohol Dehydrogenase and consultations with the Zebrafish Nomenclature Committee. Since these genes are orthologous to multiple mammalian ADH genes, the next available number in the ADH nomenclature scheme, ADH8, was used. We have named these paralogs as Adh8a and Adh8b. Materials—NAD, GSH, and 4-methyl pyrazole (4-MP) were purchased from Sigma; semicarbazide, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (12-HDDA), 1-hexanol, and 1-octanol were purchased from Aldrich; methanol, 1-propanol, and 1-pentanol, was obtained from Fisher; and 1-butanol was purchased from Acros Organics (Pittsburgh, PA). These reagents were at least 99% pure. Absolute ethyl alcohol USP was purchased from AAPER Alcohol and Chemical Co. (Shelbyville, KY). Isolation and Sequence Analysis of a cDNA Coding for Zebrafish Alcohol Dehydrogenases—An expressed sequence tag (fb62d02) was acquired through the Incyte IMAGE consortium because of its similarity to previously characterized mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. The entire cDNA was sequenced and submitted to GenBank™ as accession number AF295407. Another expressed sequence tag (fb23g01) was acquired through Incyte IMAGE consortium based on its similarity to mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. The entire cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends, sequenced, and submitted to GenBank™ as accession number AY309075. The deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed and compared with other protein sequences using the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Class I and III ADH candidates from several species were selected for sequence alignment and comparisons. Multiple sequence alignment and boxshade sequence alignments were performed using two sites on the World Wide Web: the Baylor College of Medicine site (www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/) and ch.EMBnet.org, respectively. The alignments were constructed using the deduced full-length amino acid sequences of various ADH forms from several species (see the figure legends for details). Phylogenetic Analysis—Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX, version 1.64b (24Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). The aligned amino acid sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum parsimony and minimum evolution (distance) optimality criteria in PAUP*4.0b10 (25Swofford D.L. PAUP*: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods). Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar). Alignment positions with gaps were excluded. Maximum parsimony analysis was performed using the branch-and-bound algorithm. For the minimum evolution analysis, mean character difference was used as the distance measure, and the tree-bisection-reconnection algorithm was applied to the starting tree, obtained via the neighbor-joining algorithm. Bootstrap analysis (34Ang H.L. Deltour L. Zgombic-Knight M. Wagner M.A. Duester G. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 1050-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using 100 replicates was performed to assess relative confidence in the topology obtained. Gene Mapping—The LN54 RH panel, a hybrid between zebrafish and mouse cells, was obtained from Dr. Marc Ekker (Loeb Health Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada). The panel of 94 hybrid DNAs was used to map the Adh8a and Adh8b chromosomal locations according to described methods (26Hukriede N.A. Joly L. Tsang M. Miles J. Tellis P. Epstein J.A. Barbazuk W.B. Li F.N. Paw B. Postlethwait J.H. Hudson T.J. Zon L.I. McPherson J.D. Chevrette M. Dawid I.B. Johnson S.L. Ekker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9745-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In brief, 20-μl PCRs contained 100 ng of the hybrid cell DNA from each parental cell line, 0.25 μm of each primer, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm each of dNTPs, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed with the following conditions for Adh8a: 60 s for 94 °C, 90 s for 62 °C, and 90 s for 72 °C for a total of 32 cycles using the ADH8aF1 (5′-GCTCTGTGTGTGCTGTATTC) and ADH8aR2 (5′-GTGCACTCGATTGAGAAGTC) primers. For Adh8b, the conditions used were as follows: 60 s for 94 °C, 90 s for 60 °C, and 90 s for 72 °C using the ADH8bF3 (5′-AAGCCGTCCAGCAGAAAGCAC) and ADH8bR4 (5′-AGAACTCAGGAGCGACTCCC) primers. The PCR products were separated on a 2.0% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV illumination. This assay was replicated twice before assigning a linkage group (chromosome) number using Dr. Igor Dawid's online mapping program (NICHD, National Institutes of Health; available on the World Wide Web at mgchd1.nichd.nih.gov:8080/zfrh/beta.cgi). Zebrafish ADH8A and ADH8B Protein Expression and Purification—The open reading frame of Adh8a was subcloned into the SalI and NotI sites, and the Adh8b open reading frame was subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pBlueBac 4.5 vector (Invitrogen) followed by co-infection of the recombinant baculovirus into SF-9 insect cells. A 500-ml culture for each clone, containing ∼600 × 106 cells, was harvested 48 h postinfection, and cells were pelleted and resuspended in buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Triton X-100) with a mixture of protease inhibitors, 8 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, followed by sonication. The homogenates were cleared by centrifugation prior to loading on 4-ml 5′-AMP immobilized agarose (Sigma) affinity columns. ADH8A- and ADH8B-containing extracts were each applied to separate columns followed by 45 ml of buffer A wash, with a column flow rate set at 1 ml/min. The columns were then washed with 45 ml of buffer B (450 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Triton X-100) followed by a 45-ml high stringency wash buffer C (25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Triton X-100). ADH8A and ADH8B were eluted from their respective columns with buffer C containing 0.25 mm NAD. All fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE using ultrasensitive Coomassie Blue stain. The fractions containing either ADH8A or ADH8B were pooled and dialyzed separately against 2 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm potassium chloride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C followed by a YM-3 Centricon™ concentrating apparatus (Millipore Corp.). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Crude cell lysate and purified ADH8A and ADH8B proteins were subsequently analyzed on a gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–20%) (Bio-Rad) using ultrasensitive Coomassie Blue stain. Enzyme Kinetics—The enzyme activity assays for the ADHs were performed on the SpectraMax® 90, 96-well plate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) at 340 nm to measure NADH production over time in a 200-μl reaction volume. Each well contained 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 μg of ADH8A or ADH8B, 30 mm semicarbazide, and 1 mm NAD. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 20 mm ethanol, 30 mm methanol, 30 mm 1-propanol, 30 mm 1-butanol, 1 mm 1-pentanol, 1 mm 1-hexanol, or 1 mm 1-octanol to measure ADH8A and ADH8B specific activity for each substrate. Reactions utilizing either 1 mm 12-HDDA acid or S-hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH) that formed spontaneously when 1 mm glutathione was combined with 1 mm formaldehyde also contained in each well 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 μg of ADH8A or ADH8B, and 1 mm NAD. No semicarbazide was added to these wells, since it reacts with aldehydes, thus inhibiting the production of NADH. These specific substrate concentrations have been shown to saturate class III enzymes (19Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out for 10 min at 28 °C to match the normal zebrafish environmental temperature. A blank reaction was run simultaneously without the addition of substrate to correct for any substrate-independent NADH generation. For the determination of Michaelis-Menten constants for ADH8A and ethanol, the same reaction mixture was used, except the ethanol concentrations were varied between 0.025 and 20 mm. To determine whether this enzyme was inhibited by a pyrazole derivative, from 100 μm up to 10 mm 4-methyl pyrazole was added 5 min prior to the addition of ethanol 20 mm (final concentration). The 200-μl reaction contained 100 mm of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 μg of ADH8A, 30 mm semicarbazide, and 1 mm NAD. To determine the Michaelis-Menten constants for ADH8B, the reaction conditions were as stated above; however, concentrations of each of the substrates (pentanol, hexanol, octanol, and HMGSH) were varied between 0.03125 and 10 mm. The glutathione-formaldehyde reaction contained the same reaction mixture except for semicarbazide. The kinetic data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 2001 Enzyme Kinetic module (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Adh8a and Adh8b mRNA Expression Levels—Total RNA was isolated with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (27Tanguay R.L. Andreasen E.A. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription reactions were carried out using 2 μg of total RNA isolated from developmental stages between 24 h postfertilization and 6 days postfertilization. Each RNA sample was isolated from pools consisting of 150 developmentally staged animals. For the adult expression studies, total mRNA was isolated from a whole individual adult, and 1 μg was used for each tissue expression study. Each 20-μl reverse transcription reaction contained 1× SuperScript™ II First-Strand buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2), 0.5 mm dNTPs, 250 ng of oligo(dT) primer, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 40 units of rRNasin® ribonuclease inhibitor, and 200 units of SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The following components (oligo(dT) primer 15-mer, total RNA, dNTPs, and distilled water) were added to a microcentrifuge tube and heated for 5 min at 65 °C. The contents were centrifuged, and the First-Strand buffer, dithiothreitol, and rRNasin were then added to the above mixture. This reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 2 min, followed by the addition of SuperScript™, and incubated at 42 °C for 50 min and heat inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min. Standard quantitative PCR was conducted. Briefly, each reaction contained 1× DyNAmo SYBR Green quantitative PCR kit (containing modified Thermus brockianus DNA polymerase, SYBR Green I, optimized PCR buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, dNTPs, Finnzymes; distributed by MJ Research, Inc.) and 0.3 μm forward and reverse primers: ADH8A forward (5′-CCC TCT TCC TCT CTC AGT GTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTT GTA GGT TCA GCC ATA ATG TTA T-3′); ADH8B forward (5′-GAC AGA CAA TAA AGG TTT TCC CAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTT TTG GGA TAT GAC ATA TAT TCA A-3′); β-actin forward (5′-AAG CAG GAG TAC GAT GAG TC-3′ and reverse (5′-TGG AGT CCT CAG ATG CAT TG-3′). The reactions were optimized and cycled in a MJ Research® DNA Engine Opticon™ 2 real time system (San Francisco, CA) using the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min and 94 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 14 s for a total of 39 cycles. Standard curves were generated with known amounts of target DNA for each target, and each reaction was performed in triplicate. The cycle threshold, or C(t), line was set manually for each of the gene standard curves using the Opticon Monitor™ software (MJ Research). This threshold was automatically applied to wells for consistent analysis of individual samples and standards for the experiments. Agarose gel electrophoresis and thermal denaturing (melt curve analysis) were used to confirm specific gene product formation. Isolation and Analysis of cDNA Coding for Zebrafish ADH8A and ADH8B—An expressed sequence tag (fb62d02) was acquired through the Incyte IMAGE consortium because of its similarity to alcohol dehydrogenases. The entire cDNA was sequenced and submitted to GenBank™ as accession number AF295407, and we have named it Adh8a (see below). This 1450-bp cDNA encodes a predicted 377-amino acid protein (Fig. 1). Another expressed sequence tag (fb23g01) consisting of a partial cDNA clone was acquired through the Incyte IMAGE consortium and appears to be a paralog of Adh8a; this cDNA was named Adh8b (see below). The entire cDNA was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends, sequenced and submitted to GenBank™ as accession number AY309075. This 1484-bp cDNA encodes a predicted 376-amino acid protein. Both cDNAs encode proteins having a theoretical molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 1). Class I and III ADH proteins from different species were aligned with the zebrafish ADH8A and ADH8B. Several notable observations are evident in the alignment (Fig. 1). Some regions, such as the residues between 65 and 82, are conserved across classes and species. Amino acids at positions 170–182 and 197–206 are also well conserved. There are, however, certain regions of the proteins that are unique to a class. For instance, at positions 51–53, class I is distinguished by the amino acids aspartic acid, histidine, and valine, whereas the class III proteins have alanine, tyrosine, and trytophan. The aquatic class I ADHs, zebrafish ADH8A and Baltic cod ADH8, have different amino acids at positions 51–53, leucine, tyrosine, and histidine, respectively (Fig. 1). ADH8B has the amino acids leucine, phenylalanine, and histidine, at positions 51–53, respectively. There are additional conserved residues found only in the three aquatic ADH1 proteins, including proline at position 79, lysine at position 89 (also found in mammalian class I), glutamine at positions 140 and 155, and asparagine at position 260. Overall, the zebrafish ADH8A is 82, 77, and 77% similar at the amino acid level to the Baltic cod ADH8, the human ADH5 (glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase), and the previously identified zebrafish ADH5A clone (28Dasmahapatra A.K. Doucet H.L. Bhattacharyya C. Carvan III, M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), respectively (Table I). The zebrafish ADH8B amino acid sequence is 77, 72, and 71% similar to the Baltic cod ADH8, the human ADH5, and the zebrafish ADH5A, respectively (Table I). ADH8A and ADH8B share 86% amino acid similarity. Simple multiple sequence alignment is insufficient to classify and name these alcohol dehydrogenases. The zebrafish ADH8A protein is only slightly more closely related to the mammalian (human, mouse, and rat) class III ADHs at 77% similarity than to the class I ADHs (72% similarity) (Table I). ADH8B is 70% similar to class III and 66% similar to class I ADHs. It is important to note, however, that the zebrafish ADH5A is clearly the zebrafish ortholog of the mammalian class III ADH (90% similarity) and will likely have classical class III ADH activity.Table IPercentage identity (similarity) between class 1 and 3 ADHs from different speciesZebrafish ADH8BZebrafish ADH5ABaltic cod ADH8Amphioxus ADH5Human ADH5Mouse ADH5Rat ADH5Human ADH1B2Mouse ADH1Rat ADH1%%%%%%%%%%Zebrafish ADH8A77 (86)61 (77)68 (82)60 (75)62 (77)61 (77)63 (77)56 (73)57 (72)57 (73)Zebrafish ADH8B56 (71)64 (77)56 (71)56 (72)56 (71)57 (71)52 (68)52 (67)51 (66)Zebrafish ADH5A63 (78)78 (88)81 (91)81 (90)81 (90)62 (76)61 (76)62 (77)Baltic Cod ADH160 (74)62 (76)62 (76)63 (76)55 (71)57 (73)56 (72)Amphioxus ADH574 (86)74 (86)74 (85)55 (74)55 (72)56 (74)Human ADH592 (97)93 (96)63 (78)63 (78)63 (79)Mouse ADH596 (98)62 (78)63 (78)63 (79)Rat ADH563 (78)64 (78)64 (80)Human ADH1B283 (92)81 (90)Mouse ADH189 (95) Open table in a new tab To better understand the relationships among zebrafish Adh8a and Adh8b forms and mammalian ADH sequences, phylogenetic analyses were performed using maximum parsimony and distance (minimum evolution) optimality criteria. Similar results were obtained in both analyses, as illustrated by the minimum evolution tree shown in Fig. 2. The two zebrafish ADH8 sequences formed a monophyletic group with Baltic cod protein originally named as ADH1 (29Danielsson O. Eklund H. Jornvall H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3751-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For consistency, we will refer to this mixed functional ADH as the Baltic cod ADH8. Together, these three sequences formed a sister group to a clade containing all mammalian ADH1, ADH4, ADH6, and ADH7 proteins. The entire clade of fish ADH8 and mammalian ADH1/4/6/7 proteins was strongly supported (present in parsimony and distance trees and with a distance bootstrap value of 100), and this clade was distinct from the fish and mammalian class III proteins (ADH5). The topology of these trees suggests that zebrafish ADH8A/B and cod ADH8 share a unique common ancestor with the mammalian ADH1, ADH4, ADH6, and ADH7 proteins and that the diversification of these four mammalian ADH classes (I, II, IV, and V) occurred after the divergence of the mammalian and fish lineages. Because the current system of ADH nomenclature does not provide a way to indicate these co-orthologous relationships, the zebrafish sequences reported here have been assigned the next available family number (family 8). To determine whether Adh8a or Adh8b resides on a zebrafish chromosome exhibiting conserved synteny relative to the chromosome containing human ADH genes, Adh8a and Adh8b gene locations were mapped. A PCR-based approach using the LN54 radiation hybrid panel (a hybrid between zebrafish and mouse cells (26Hukriede N.A. Joly L. Tsang M. Miles J. Tellis P. Epstein J.A. Barbazuk W.B. Li F.N. Paw B. Postlethwait J.H. Hudson T.J. Zon L.I. McPherson J.D. Chevrette M. Dawid I.B. Johnson S.L. Ekker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9745-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)) was used to map Adh8a to chromosome 13, 31.47 centirays from the Z9049 marker. Adh8b was mapped to chromosome 13, 41.25 centirays from Z1627. One centiray is ∼148 kb in the LN54 radiation hybrid panel; thus, Adh8b is 24.13 centirays or ∼3.6 megabases from Adh8a. Zebrafish chromosome 13 has a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4, the location of all human ADH genes. In addition to the LN54 mapping hybrid panel, ADH8A and ADH8B nucleotide sequences were blasted against the zebrafish genome on The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute site on the World Wide Web (www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/), but we were unable to confirm the chromosomal location of these genes as the sequences are not completely represented in the latest genomic data release.

https://openalex.org/W1978686575,"HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 17p13.3, a region frequently hypermethylated or deleted in human tumors and in a contiguous-gene syndrome, the Miller-Dieker syndrome. HIC1 is a transcriptional repressor containing five Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers and an N-terminal dimerization and autonomous repression domain called BTB/POZ. Although some of the HIC1 transcriptional repression mechanisms have been recently deciphered, target genes are still to be discovered. In this study, we determined the consensus binding sequence for HIC1 and investigated its DNA binding properties. Using a selection and amplification of binding sites technique, we identified the sequence 5′-C/GNGC/GGGGCAC/A CC-3′ as an optimal binding site. In silico and functional analyses fully validated this consensus and highlighted a GGCA core motif bound by zinc fingers 3 and 4. The BTB/POZ domain inhibits the binding of HIC1 to a single site but mediates cooperative binding to a probe containing five concatemerized binding sites, a property shared by other BTB/POZ proteins. Finally, full-length HIC1 proteins transiently expressed in RK13 cells and more importantly, endogenous HIC1 proteins from the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, repress the transcription of a reporter gene through their direct binding to these sites, as confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. The definition of the HIC1-specific DNA binding sequence as well as the requirement for multiple sites for optimal binding of the full-length protein are mandatory prerequisites for the identification and analyses of bona fide HIC1 target genes.

HIC1 has been considered a candidate tumor suppressor because its enforced expression by stable transfection in various cancer cell lines results in a significant decrease in their clonogenic survival and its expression is up-regulated by p53 (1Makos-Wales M. Biel M. El Deiry W. Nelkin B.D. Issa J.P. Cavenee W.K. Kuerbitz S.J. Baylin S.B. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 7Guérardel C. Deltour S. Pinte S. Monté D.

Clues to the tumor suppressor function of HIC1 have recently come from the study of HIC1-deficient mice (8Chen W.Y. Zeng X. Carter M. Morell C.N. Chiu Yen R.-W. Esteller M. Watkins D.N. Herman J.G.

Carter M. Morell C.N. Chiu Yen R.-W. Esteller M. Watkins D.N. Herman J.G. Mankowski J.L. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). HIC1 could also be implicated in a contiguous-gene syndrome, the Miller-Dieker syndrome, a severe form of lissencephaly accompanied by developmental anomalies (10Yingling J. Toyo-oka K. Wynshaw-Boris A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 73: 475-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the isolated lissencephaly sequence is caused by point mutations or intragenic deletions in the LIS1 gene (11Wynshaw-Boris A. Gambello M.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the more severe cortical phenotype as well as the craniofacial and limb defects seen in the Miller-Dieker syndrome are the result of heterozygous deletions in another critical region in 17p13.3 including HIC1 (12Cardoso C. Leventer R.J. Ward H.L. Toyo-oka K. Chung J. Martin C.L. Allanson J. Pilz D.T. Olney A.H. Mutchinick O.M. Hirotsune S. Wynshaw-Boris A. Dobyns W.B. Ledbetter D.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Together with perinatal death and a reduction in overall size, HIC1–/– mouse embryos have other developmental anomalies resembling those found in Miller-Dieker syndrome patients, including craniofacial dysmorphology, defects of the limbs and digits, and omphalocele (9Carter M.G.

Finally, a high HIC1 expression is detected in the precursors of certain tissues that exhibit abnormalities in Miller-Dieker syndrome patients (13Grimm C. Spörle R. Schmid T.E. Adler I.-D. Adamski A. Schughart K. Graw J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Bertrand S. Pinte S. Stankovic-Valentin N. Deltour-Balerdi S. Guérardel C. Bègue A.

HIC1 encodes a protein with five Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers in the C terminus and a protein-protein interaction domain called the BTB/POZ domain at the N terminus (1Makos-Wales M. Biel M. El Deiry W. Nelkin B.D. Issa J.P. Cavenee W.K. Kuerbitz S.J. Baylin S.B. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 15Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G.

Guérardel C. Leprince D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14831-14836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The BTB/POZ domain is a conserved structural motif found mainly in transcription factors and actin-binding proteins. Crystal structures of the PLZF and BCL6 BTB/POZ domains have demonstrated that this domain is a tightly intertwined obligate dimer with a conserved dimerization interface (18Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Privé G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Ahmad K.F. Melnick A. Lax S. Bouchard D. Liu J. Kiang C.-L. Mayer S. Takahashi S. Licht J.D. Privé G.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1551-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Focusing on BTB/POZ transcription factors, they can function as transcriptional repressors, activators, or both, but in most cases, the homo/heterodimerization or even oligomerization properties of the BTB/POZ domain appear essential for their biological function. Indeed, the BTB/POZ domain can negatively regulate the DNA binding of the full-length protein to a single site (16Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Likewise, the oligomerization of the protein via its BTB/POZ domain can mediate cooperative DNA binding to multiple sites as shown for GAGA (20Espinas M.L. Jimenez-Garcia E. Vaquero A. Canudas S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5389-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, the BTB/POZ domain is essential for the function of transcriptional repressors by directly recruiting nuclear corepressors (SMRT, N-CoR, or B-CoR)-histone deacetylase complexes, as shown for the human PLZF and BCL6 proteins (19Ahmad K.F. Melnick A. Lax S. Bouchard D. Liu J. Kiang C.-L. Mayer S. Takahashi S. Licht J.D. Privé G.G. Mol.

Previously, we have shown that HIC1 is a transcriptional repressor (17Deltour S. Guérardel C. Leprince D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14831-14836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as is its avian ortholog, called γFBP-B (γF1-binding protein B) because it has been isolated as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor of the γF-crystallin (Crygf) gene (29Liu Q. Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Breitman M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Liu Q. Shalaby F. Puri M.C. Tang S. Breitman M.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, HIC1 and γFBP-B contain a short sequence, GLDLSKK, which is involved in the recruitment of the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) corepressor (see Fig. 1) (31Deltour S. Pinte S. Guérardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, HIC1 is clearly a transcriptional repressor, but so far no bona fide target genes for mammalian HIC1 proteins have been described. Although γFBP-B is expressed during chicken lens differentiation (29Liu Q. Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Breitman M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Liu Q. Shalaby F. Puri M.C. Tang S. Breitman M.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), murine HIC1 gene expression is not detected in lenses at embryonic, postnatal, or adult stages by in situ hybridization studies, suggesting that it is not implicated in the regulation of Crygf gene (13Grimm C. Spörle R. Schmid T.E. Adler I.-D. Adamski A. Schughart K. Graw J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As a first step toward the identification of HIC1 target genes, we have determined the HIC1-specific DNA binding sequence using multiple rounds of SAAB (selection and amplification of binding sites) (32Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In silico analyses using the zinc finger recognition code (33Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with various mutated sequences fully validated this consensus and highlighted the GGCA core motif bound by zinc fingers 3 and 4. Notably, this consensus sequence is highly divergent from the γF1 site except for the presence of this GGCA core. A ΔPOZ mutant protein can bind efficiently to a probe containing a single optimized sequence, whereas the full-length HIC1 protein cannot. By contrast, the full-length HIC1 protein binds cooperatively and in a BTB/POZ-dependent manner to a probe containing five concatemerized binding sites and represses the transcription of a reporter gene through its direct binding to these sites, as confirmed by ChIP experiments. These results have been obtained either with exogenous proteins expressed by transient transfection in RK13 cells or, more importantly, with endogenous HIC1 proteins found in the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line. The definition of the HIC1-specific DNA binding sequence as well as the requirement for multiple sites for optimal binding of the full-length protein are mandatory prerequisites for the identification and analyses of bona fide HIC1 target genes. Production of a GST-HIC1 Fusion Protein—A 1.2-kbp SmaI fragment of a human HIC1 clone encoding amino acids 348–714 was fused in-frame downstream of GST into the SmaI-digested pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences). This construct was introduced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, and the GST-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted from the beads, as described previously (17Deltour S. Guérardel C. Leprince D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14831-14836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Dhordain P. Albagli O. Lin R.J. Ansieau S. Quief S. Leutz A. Kerckaert J.P. Evans R.M. Leprince D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10762-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). SAAB—To identify the HIC1 DNA binding consensus sequences, the SAAB method (32Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) was carried out with minor modifications. For the first set of binding site selections, a library of double-stranded random oligomers was obtained by PCR using the 64-base random oligonucleotide N26 (5′-GGCTGAGTCTGAACGGATCC-N26-CCTCGAGACTGAGCGTCG-3′) as a template (10 ng) and 1 μg of primer 1 (5′-CGACGCTCAGTCTCGAGG-3′) and primer 2 (5′-GGCTGAGTCTGAACGGATCC-3′) for amplification (34Kawamata N. Miki T. Ohashi K. Suzuki K. Fukuda T. Hirosawa S. Aoki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The double-stranded DNA (6 μl) was incubated on ice for 20 min with 0.3 μg of GST-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm fusion protein in a final 20-μl volume of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnCl2, 5% glycerol) containing 5 μg/ml poly(dI·dC). The resulting DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, excised from the gel, and eluted at 4 °C in 500 μl of water. The recovered 10 μl of DNA was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR with primers 1 and 2. After four rounds of selection, a fraction of the last PCR product was cloned directly using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A second set of experiments was performed with double-stranded random oligomers obtained by PCR using 10 ng of the 65-base random oligonucleotide N12-TGC-N12 (5′-GGCTGAGTCTGAACGGATCC-N12-TGC-N12-TCTCGAGACTGAGCGTCG-3′) as a template and 1 μg of primer 1′ (5′-CGACGCTCAGTCTCGAGA-3′) and primer 2, as described above with the GST-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm protein. Finally, another set of selection was performed with this pool of N12-TGC-N12 oligomers and a FLAG-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm protein produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (2 μl). Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—COS-7, RK13 (rabbit kidney), and the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected in OptiMEM by the polyethyleneimine method as described previously (31Deltour S. Pinte S. Guérardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) either in 90-mm dishes for COS-7 cells (nuclear extracts) with 2.5 μg of DNA or in 12-well plates with 500 ng of DNA for RK13 cells (repression assays), for 6 h and then incubated in fresh complete medium. The cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline 48 h after transfection and processed for nuclear extracts (COS-7) or luciferase assays (RK13). DAOY cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Repression Assays—The repression assays were carried out as described previously (17Deltour S. Guérardel C. Leprince D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14831-14836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Deltour S. Pinte S. Guérardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured by using, respectively, beetle luciferin (Promega) and the Galacto-light Kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA) with a Berthold (Nashua, NH) chemoluminometer. After normalization to β-galactosidase activity, the data were expressed as Luc activity relative to the activity of pSV40-Luc with empty control vector (pcDNA3), which was given an arbitrary value of 1. Results presented are the mean values ± S.D. from one experiment representative of three independent transfections in triplicate. Plasmid Construction—The full-length FLAG-HIC1 1–714 and ΔPOZ mutant containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope cloned in the pcDNA3 expression vector have been described previously (31Deltour S. Pinte S. Guérardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The C521S point mutant (35Reemann N. Gaul U. Jackle H. Nature. 1988; 322: 90-92Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was generated by a two-round PCR strategy and verified by sequencing. To construct the 5xHiRE-SV40-Luc reporter plasmid, two complementary 5xHiRE (HIC1-responsive element) oligonucleotides containing overhanging GATC sequences (see below) were annealed and cloned into the BglII site of the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene driven by an SV40 promoter. Nuclear Extracts, Western Blot, and EMSAs—Nuclear extracts were prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 or from DAOY cells according to the mini-extracts protocol (36Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Protein expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses with the M2 monoclonal or with anti-HIC1 polyclonal (31Deltour S. Pinte S. Guérardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) antibodies. These nuclear extracts or the various constructions, expressed in 2-μl reticulocyte lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega), were incubated on ice for 20 min in a final 20-μl volume of binding buffer as described above with the relevant γ-32P-labeled probe. For competition assays, the cold competitor was included in the binding reaction. For antibody supershift experiments, the mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the relevant antibody prior to the addition of the labeled probe and incubation on ice for a further 20 min. The sequences of the wild-type clone 5 probe and of the various mutated oligonucleotides used in competitive EMSAs are detailed in Table II. The oligonucleotides used for the cooperative binding assays and for the construction of the 5xHiRE reporter are as follows with the 5 HIC1 binding sites in bold: 5xHiRE probe wt (sense), 5′-GATCTGGGTTGCCCCCAGGGGGCAACCCAAGGGGGCAACCCTTCTAGAAGGGTTGCCCCCGGGGCAACCCA-3′; 5xHiRE probe wt (antisense), 5′-GATCTGGGTTGCCCCGGGGGCAACCCTTCTAGAAGGGTTGCCCCCTTGGGTTGCCCCCTGGGGGCAACCCA-3′.Table IISequences of the oligonucleotides used in the competitive EMSAs Open table in a new tab The sequence of the mutated 5xHiRE oligonucleotide used in competitive EMSAs is shown (sense strand) with the mutation in the TGC or GCA core sequences indicated in lowercase letters: 5xHiRE probe mutated (sense), 5′-GATCTGGGTcatCCCCAGGGGatgACCCAAGGGGatgACCCTTCTAGAAGGGTcatCCCCGGGatgACCCA-3′. ChIP Assay—Briefly, 2 × 107 RK13 or DAOY cells transfected for 48 h with the indicated vectors were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclei were isolated, resuspended in 1.7 ml of sonication buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors), and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed (at this point, 160 μl was saved as input) and precleared for 15 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of preblocked protein A-agarose beads. After centrifugation the supernatants were removed (800 μl) and incubated with 10 μl of the precipitating antibody and 200 μl of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.04% SDS, 4.4% Triton X-100, 4.8 mm EDTA, 66.8 mm Tris, pH 8, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors) overnight at 4 °C. 200 μl of preblocked protein A-agarose beads was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Immune complexes were washed twice with dialysis buffer (2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.2% sarkosyl) and four times with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 9, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate). DNAs were eluted twice for 30 min in 500 μl of elution buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS). Then, NaCl (0.3 m final concentration) and 2 μl of RNase A (5 mg/ml) were added. The two eluates were combined and incubated at 67 °C for 5 h to reverse the cross-links. After ethanol precipitation, DNAs were extracted and used for PCR. Briefly, the PCRs were performed with 5 μl of DNAs, 200 ng of each primer (reverse primer, 5′-GCTGTCCCCAGTGCAAGTGC-3′; and forward primer, 5′-CTAATTGAGATGCAGATCGC-3′) for 40 cycles. HIC1 Binding Site Selection—To define an optimal HIC1 DNA binding sequence, a GST-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm fusion protein was incubated with a mixture of double-stranded 64-mers containing 26 nucleotides of random core sequence, N26 (Fig. 1). Bound oligonucleotides were recovered and amplified by PCR (32Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). After four sequential rounds of EMSA/PCR selection, the bound oligonucleotides were subcloned, and 45 clones were sequenced. They were different, but strikingly, two-thirds (33 of 45) contained a TGC triplet just upstream from the CCTCGAG flanking sequence of the 3′-primer (Table I). In fact, all selected clones contain at least one copy of the TGCC (or of its complementary GGCA) sequence found in the γF1 binding motif (5′-TTCCTGCCAACACAGCAGACCTC-3′), which allowed the cloning of γFBP, the chicken ortholog of HIC1, by Southwestern screening of a lens cDNA library (29Liu Q. Tini M. Tsui L.-C. Breitman M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Liu Q. Shalaby F. Puri M.C. Tang S. Breitman M.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These experiments thus highlighted the TGCC sequence as a core motif, but the consensus binding site sequence could not be fully deduced because most of the selected sequences overlap with the common 3′-oligonucleotide (Table I).Table IOverview of the sequences (34 of 45) selected by the GST-5ZF-Cterm HIC1 fusion protein Open table in a new tab A second set of selection was performed with oligomers containing the central TGC sequence found in the first selection flanked by 12 nucleotides of random sequences, N12-TGC-N12 (Fig. 1B). After six rounds of selection with the GST-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm protein, the sequence of 74 clones revealed a 13-nucleotide GC-rich consensus centered on a TGCCC core, 5′-CCGGGTGCCC(G/C)(G/C)(G/C)-3′ (Fig. 2A). Notably, the γF1 motif is highly divergent from this consensus, except for the presence of a TGCC motif (Fig. 2A). Finally, we performed a third set of selection with the N12-TGC-N12 oligomers and a FLAG-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm HIC1 protein expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. After five rounds of selection, 32 clones were sequenced, and a similar consensus was obtained, albeit slightly extended in its 3′-end. In addition, a T or a Gis observed at similar frequency upstream of the TGC sequence (Fig. 2B) instead of the G observed preferentially with the bacterial fusion protein (Fig. 2A). One of the sequences, clone 5 (Cl5) found in the second set of selection with the GST-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm protein, was also selected three times by the FLAG-HIC1 5ZF-Cterm protein. Because its sequence very closely matched the consensus (Fig. 2B), it was chosen for the confirmatory EMSAs. The crystal structure of the three zinc fingers of Zif268 bound to DNA, and numerous functional studies have established that each zinc finger contains a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and an α-helix and binds 3 bp in the DNA major groove through specific contacts with the N-terminal part of the α-helix (37Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 38Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 3: 183-212Google Scholar, 39Iuchi S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thanks to the constant accumulation of new data, a “recognition code” that relates the amino acids of a given zinc finger, notably residues at positions –1, +3, and +6 of the α-helix, to its DNA target has been proposed (33Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and validated for natural (38Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 3: 183-212Google Scholar) or engineered (40Corbi N. Perez M. Maione R. Passananti C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) zinc fingers. We have applied this code to zinc fingers 2–5 of HIC1, which are separated by a 7–8-amino acid conserved H/C link typical of Krüppel-like zinc fingers making them likely to be involved in sequence-specific DNA binding (Fig. 1A) (37Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Indeed, a construct containing only the zinc fingers 2–4 binds specific DNA as efficiently as a 5ZF or 5ZF-Cterm construct (data not shown). According to the matrix proposed by Choo and Klug (33Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), an in silico defined binding sequence can be assigned at some positions (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the TGC triplet that emerged from our first selection (see Table I) and was thus imposed in the second and third sets of selection is unambiguously predicted for the zinc finger 3 of HIC1 (Fig. 2C). In addition, an arginine at –1 and at +6, when present, is always associated with binding to a G at the third and the first positions of two consecutive subsites, respectively (39Iuchi S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), a fact that validates our experimentally defined TGCC core (Table I; Fig. 2, A and B). Finally, because these analyses also defined the primary DNA strand with which most of the amino acid contacts are made, the HIC1 core consensu"
https://openalex.org/W2089015746,"Here we report the functional characterization of Pwp2, an evolutionary conserved component of the 90 S pre-ribosome. Conditional depletion of the Pwp2 protein in yeast specifically impairs pre-rRNA proccessing at sites A0, A1, and A2, leading to a strong decrease in 18 S rRNA and 40 S ribosomal subunit levels. Pre-ribosomal particle sedimentation analysis indicated that these defects are caused by a block in the formation of 90 S pre-ribosomes. We demonstrate that in Pwp2-depleted cells the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein is not able to interact with the 35 S pre-rRNA and accumulates as a free complex. Similarly, other 90 S particle components such as Imp3 and Imp4 do not associate with the pre-rRNA precursor in the absence of Pwp2. In addition, we have found that after blocking U3 ribonucleoprotein assembly, Pwp2 predominantly accumulates as a complex in association with five proteins: Dip2, Utp6, Utp13, Utp18, and Utp21. Immunoprecipitation and gradient sedimentation analysis revealed that this Pwp2 small subcomplex is capable of interacting directly with the 35 S pre-rRNA 5′ end. Taken together, these results indicate that Pwp2 forms part of a stable particle subunit independent of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein that is essential for the initial assembly steps of the 90 S pre-ribosome.

It has been calculated that a yeast cell produces ∼40 new ribosomes per second to keep its metabolic and growth status (1Warner J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). This biosynthetic process imposes a costly metabolic demand, since it involves the biosynthesis and assembly of ≈80 ribosomal proteins, four rRNAs (25, 18, 5.8, and 5 S), large numbers of proteins involved in rRNA maturation, and multiple snoRNPs 1The abbreviations used are: snoRNP, small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; ETS, external transcribed spacer; ITS, internal transcribed spacer; Pwp2, periodic tryptophan protein 2.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Of all these biosynthetic processes, the generation of 25, 18, and 5.8 S rRNAs is perhaps the most challenging for cells. This process initiates in the nucleolus with the transcription by RNA polymerase I of the 35 S pre-rRNA precursor, a 7,000-nucleotide-long polycistronic transcript that contains the sequences of the 18, 5.8, and 25 S rRNAs embedded in non coding regions (for a scheme, see Fig. 1). The 35 S rRNA is rapidly cleaved at sites A0 (giving rise to the 33 S pre-rRNA), A1 (generating the 32 S pre-rRNA), and A2 (producing the 20 S and the 27 S A2 pre-rRNAs; Fig. 1). The 20 and 27 S A2 precursors maturate further following two separate branches. In the first one, the 20 S pre-rRNA is exported to the cytosol where it is cleaved at site D to produce the 18 S rRNA which, in turn, will form part of the 40 S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 1). In the other processing branch, the 27 S A2 pre-rRNA remains in the nucleolus where it is processed following two alternative routes to give rise to the 5.8 and 25 S rRNA products (Fig. 1). These two rRNAs, together with the 5 S rRNA independently transcribed by RNA polymerase III outside the nucleolus, will be the final RNA components of the 60 S ribosomal subunit (2Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 3Fatica A. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 5Kressler D. Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These two processing pathways are not mutually dependent, as demonstrated by the isolation of mutants affecting exclusively the production of either 18 or 25 S rRNAs. In addition to the cleavage steps, the pre-rRNAs undergo a number of covalent modifications such as base methylation and isomerization (6Kiss T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 7Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). All rRNA maturation steps require the implication of at least 170 proteins and about as many snoRNPs that assemble with the pre-rRNAs in discrete multiprotein/RNA complexes known as pre-ribosomal particles (3Fatica A. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 4Tschochner H. Hurt E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 255-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Fromont-Racine M. Senger B. Saveanu C. Fasiolo F. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 313: 17-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These molecules are derived from transcription of specific loci catalyzed by either RNA polymerase II (proteins) or III (snoRNAs). By analogy to the ribosomal subunits, pre-ribosomal complexes have been classically referred to as 90, 66, and 43 S according to their specific sedimentation profile on sucrose gradients (9Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Trapman J. Retel J. Planta R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 90: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The 90 S particles contain assembly/processing factors that mediate the early cleavage of the 35 S pre-rRNA precursor at sites A0, A1, and A2. The 43 and 66 S particles harbor downstream pre-rRNAs involved in the production of 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits, respectively. Despite significant progress made using genetic approaches during the last decade, the complexity of the pre-ribosomal particles precluded until very recently their structural and biochemical characterization. This impediment has been tackled recently through the use of proteomics, a high throughput approach that allowed the identification of a plethora of specific 90, 60, and 40 S components and protein subcomplexes (3Fatica A. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 4Tschochner H. Hurt E.

Cell. 2004; 13: 225-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The preliminary characterization of some of these new proteins in yeast has shown that their elimination usually leads to a lethal phenotype derived from the block of specific rRNA maturation branches, suggesting that the architecture of the different pre-ribosomal particles requires a multidimensional network of intermolecular interactions for maintaining both their stability and rRNA maturation. Notwithstanding these advances, there are still important questions to be addressed to understand all rRNA biogenesis steps. Among those, perhaps the most challenging one is unveiling the specific role of each of the identified proteins in the complex functional network of pre-rRNA processing. Such characterization will need the individual functional analysis of each pre-ribosomal component, the monitorization of its dynamic behavior (assembly, disassembly, protein levels, and posttranslational modifications) during the full process of rRNA biogenesis, as well as the understanding of the relative position of each molecule in relation to the other proteins and RNAs of the particle. In this context, another important question is to reveal the building blocks contributing to the tridimensional structure of each pre-ribosomal particle and to define whether the numerous protein subcomplexes identified by systematic proteomic analysis correspond to functional particle subunits. Given their inherent complexity, the resolution of these pending questions will probably require a multifaceted approach combining genetic, biochemical, and proteomic techniques. In this work, we have started to apply this experimental approach to one of the recently identified components of the 90 S pre-ribosomal particle, the yeast periodic tryptophan protein 2 (Pwp2). Pwp2 is a 923-amino acid-long protein mainly composed by a repetitive arrangement of 8 WD domains, a motif distribution consistent with a β propeller tridimensional structure (12Li D. Roberts R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2085-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, it contains a highly conserved coiled-coil domain of unknown function at the C terminus. Pwp2 was discovered in humans in 1996 due to its close proximity to AIRE, a gene locus involved in progressive myoclonus epilepsy (13Yamakawa K. Gao D.Q. Korenberg J.R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 74: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 14Lalioti M.D. Chen H. Rossier C. Shafaatian R. Reid J.D. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1996; 35: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At the same time, its yeast homologue was isolated during the characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III. Since then, the sequencing of different genomes revealed that PWP2 has been conserved as a single copy gene in all eukaryotes. Although this high structural and phylogenetic conservation points toward an essential function for this protein, its specific role in the cell has remained unsettled until recently. Initially, Pwp2 was described as an essential protein in yeast with a subcellular distribution in cytoplasmic clusters (15Shafaatian R. Payton M.A. Reid J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was observed that yeast deficient in Pwp2 generated chains of cells that could not separate due to defects in septum hydrolysis. Based on these observations, it was assumed that Pwp2 was a cytoskeletal-related protein involved in the hydrolysis of the cell wall at the septum after cell division (15Shafaatian R. Payton M.A. Reid J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, Pwp2 was recently identified as a nucleolar protein involved in 18 S rRNA biogenesis that forms part of the 90 S pre-ribosomal particle and of a small 90 S pre-ribosome subcomplex (11Krogan N.J. Peng W.T. Cagney G. Robinson M.D. Haw R. Zhong G. Guo X. Zhang X. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Beattie B.K. Lalev A. Zhang W. Davierwala A.P. Mnaimneh S. Starostine A. Tikuisis A.P. Grigull J. Datta N.

Nature. 2002; 417: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Independently to those studies, we focused on Pwp2 during our search for regulators of cell morphogenesis in yeast. During such characterization, we found that Pwp2 is involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Given the lack of information about the specific role of Pwp2 in pre-rRNA processing and about its functional relationship with other components of the 90 S pre-ribosomal particle, we decided to characterize its function in detail. As it will be reported here, such characterization allowed us to gain substantial information about Pwp2 itself and, in addition, to shed light into important aspects of the early steps of 18 S rRNA biogenesis such as the assembly of the 90 S particle and the dynamics of protein recycling before and after the cleavage steps of the 35 S pre-rRNA precursor. Yeast Strains and Genetic Methods—Conditional mutant strains for PWP2 (YMD12), MPP10 (YMD27), and NOP58 (YMD59) under the control of the represible GAL1 promoter were generated by the one-step PCR strategy (18Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar). This strategy resulted in the in-frame fusion of either KANMX6-GAL1-HA or TRP1-GAL1-HA cassettes upstream of the ATG of the appropriate gene. These strains are referred to in the main text as GAL::HA-pwp2, GAL::HA-mpp10, and GAL::HA-nop58. Epitope-tagged gene strains (YMD19, YMD43, YMD44, YMD57, YMD66, and YMD68) were also generated by PCR and one-step insertion by homologous recombination in the genome. In these strains, the epitope-tagged versions are the only source of the proteins in the cell, and their expression is driven from their cognate promoters. Genetic manipulations were done using standard procedures. Correct integrations were corroborated by PCR. The genotypes of all the yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Growth of yeast strains was done in either galactose (YPGal, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.8% peptone, 0.1 mm adenine, 2% galactose)- or glucose (YPD, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.8% peptone, 0.1 mm adenine, 2% dextrose)-containing medium.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyNameGenotypeaAll strains were derived from the W303 background.OriginW303aMATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3Derived from Euroscarf 20000DYMD12MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, KANMX6-GAL::HA-pwp2This studyYMD19MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, pwp2-HA::KANMX6This studyYMD27MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, TRP1::GAL::HA-mpp10, pwp2-GFP::KANMX6This studyYMD30MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, TRP1::GAL::HA-nop58This studyYMD43MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, rrp9-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD44MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, nop7-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD51MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, KANMX6-GAL::HA-pwp2, rrp9-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD54MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, KANMX6-GAL::HA-pwp2, nop7-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD57MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, pwp2-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD59MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, TRP1::GAL::HA-nop58, pwp2-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD66MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, imp3-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD68MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, imp4-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD73MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, KANMX6-GAL::HA-pwp2, imp4-MYC::HIS3This studyYMD74MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, KANMX6-GAL::HA-pwp2, imp4-MYC::HIS3This studya All strains were derived from the W303 background. Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Preparation of total cellular lysates for direct immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19Lafontaine D.L. Tollervey D. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters using a Trans-Blot™ apparatus (Bio-Rad). After incubations with the appropriate antibodies, immunoreactive bands were developed using an enhanced chemiolumiscent method (ECL Plus™, Amersham Biosciences). RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—RNAs derived from yeast cells, immunoprecipitations, or gradient fractionations were isolated using the hot-phenol procedure (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Analysis of RNA integrity and quantitation of 25/18 S ratios were performed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer™. Total RNAs were separated in either 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde or 8% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels and transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The following oligonucleotides were used for analyzing pre-rRNA intermediaries (see Fig. 3A) and rRNAs: probe 1a, 5′-TCAGGTCTCTCTGCTGC-3′; probe 1b, 5′-TTCCCACCTATTCCCTCTTGC-3′; probe 2, 5′-AGCCATTCGCAGTTTCACTG-3′; probe 3, 5′-TACTAAGGCAATCCCGGTTGG-3′; probe 4, 5′-TTAAGCGCAGGCCCGGCT-3′; probe 5, 5′-TGTTACCTCTGGGCC-3′; probe 6, 5′-AATTTCCAGTTACGAAAATTCTTG-3′; probe 7, 5′-GCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3′; probe 8, 5′-GGCCAGCAATTTCAAGTTA-3′; 5S rRNA, 5′-CAGTTGATCGGACGGGAAAC-3′.

Oligonucleotide labeling and hybridization was performed as described (21Kressler D. de la Cruz J. Rojo M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7283-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Cells equivalent to 20 A600 units were harvested and disrupted using glass beads (Sigma) in IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm potasium acetate, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). Precleared lysates were incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h under gentle rotation. Monoclonal antibodies used were anti-Nop1 (EnCor Biotechnology), anti-MYC (Roche Applied Science), and anti-HA (Covance). Following incubation with GammaBind™ Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), immunoprecipitates were washed four times with IP buffer. Half of the immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in 40 μl of SDS loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot for protein detection. The other half of the immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in 400 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA (pH 5.2), 1% SDS, and processed for RNA extraction. After ethanol precipitation, RNAs were resuspended in 20 μl of RNA dot-blot buffer (7.5 mm sodium citrate, 75 mm NaCl, 50% formamide, 6,5% formaldehyde). After denaturation at 68 °C for 15 min, RNAs were immobilized onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes using a Milliblot-D system (Millipore) and UV-cross-linked before hybridization. In some cases (i.e.Fig. 5), membranes containing either protein or RNA samples from the same immunoprecipitations were sequentially incubated with different antibodies or radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Sucrose Gradient Analysis—Polysome analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation was done as described (22Foiani M. Cigan A.M. Paddon C.J. Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3203-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In brief, cell cultures (200 ml) were grown to A600 between 0.8 and 1.0. Immediately before harvesting, cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg·ml–1. Cells were lysed in 700 μl of PP lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg·ml–1, cycloheximide and 0.2 mg·ml–1 heparin) using a Fastprep™ apparatus (Savant). After pre-clearing by high speed centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, extracts equivalent to 5–20 absorption units at 260 nm (A260) were layered onto 7–50% sucrose gradients (12 ml), which had been prepared in 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 50 mm NH4Cl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Ultracentrifugation was performed in a SW 40 rotor (Beckman) at 39,000 rpm for 165 min at 4 °C. After this step, gradients were processed in a gradient collector system (ISCO) that allowed the simultaneous collection and absorbance (254 nm) read-out of fractions. For ribosomal subunit quantification, cells were not incubated with cycloheximide and, in addition, the extracts and gradients were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Fractions from each gradient were analyzed by Western and Northern blot. For protein analysis, 40-μl samples from each fraction were mixed with 10 μlof5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For pre-rRNA and snoRNA analysis, total RNAs of each fraction were prepared. In brief, 100-μl aliquots were mixed with 300 μl of 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.4) plus 40 μl of 10% SDS and incubated at 65 °C for 2 min. These aliquots were then extracted once with phenol, once with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. After resuspension in formaldehyde loading buffer, RNAs were finally analyzed by Northern blot as described above. Purification of the Pwp2 Complex and Mass Spectrometry Analysis— The 25–30 S Pwp2 subcomplex was purified from the YMD59 strain (see Table I) using a large scale co-immunoprecipitation approach. To this end, yeast cultures (2 liters) were grown to an A600 of 0.8–1.0. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of cold IP buffer and lysed with a bead beater (Biospec). The lysates obtained were centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C and supernatants transferred to 70Ti ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman). After a centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, the supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 200 μl of an anti-MYC 9E10 affinity matrix (Covance). This mix was transferred to a disposable chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 40 ml of IP buffer. Bound material was eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and loaded in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were silver-stained and gel sections with the proteins of interest sliced out. Samples were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and the resulting fragments analyzed in a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Ultraflex, Bruker). Protein identification was performed by searches on the Swiss-Prot data base using the Mascot algorithm.

Genet. 1996; 252: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we decided to generate an inducible yeast strain in which the endogenous PWP2 locus was replaced by a GAL::HA-pwp2 construct. Due to the presence of the GAL1 promoter in this new allele, this yeast strain can now express a HA-tagged version of Pwp2 in a galactose-dependent manner. Immunoblot experiments confirmed that the shift of this yeast strain from a galactose to a glucose-rich medium induced a strong repression of the GAL::HA-pwp2 allele in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, inset). These cells also underwent a dramatic decrease in their growth rates under such conditions (Fig. 2A), confirming that the GAL::HA-pwp2 construct is a truly conditionally null allele of the PWP2 gene. To characterize the defects responsible for the lethal phenotype of yeast lacking Pwp2, we first examined processes related to cytoskeletal organization and cell division. Microscopic analysis of GAL::HA-pwp2 cells growing in galactose medium indicated that they have a normal morphology (Fig. 2B, left panel). However, in the presence of glucose medium, GAL::HA-pwp2 cells increase significantly in size and display large vacuoles in the cytosol (Fig. 2B, right panel). A significant percentage of cells (≈20%) show also abnormal cell division, as evidenced by the presence of enlarged buds with pronounced apical growth that do not separate from the mother cell even after long periods of time (Fig. 2B, right panel). A small percentage of cells (2%) showed two or even three elongated buds that were kept interconnected along the same polarized axis. 2M. Dosil and X. R. Bustelo, unpublished observations. Regardless of their morphology, these buds remain attached to the mother cell even after mild sonication of the cultures, 2M. Dosil and X. R. Bustelo, unpublished observations. suggesting that they have arisen as a consequence of dysfunctions in cytokinesis rather than in cell separation. These phenotypes are different from those reported before for a conditionally null strain of PWP2 (15Shafaatian R. Payton M.A. Reid J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In that case, it was reported that Pwp2 depletion induces mostly chains of three to eight connected cells, a defect attributed to dysfunctions in the hydrolysis of the septum. Whether these phenotypic differences are due to different genetic backgrounds or to other causes remains to be determined. To shed light into the causes of this cell division defect, we decided to perform microarray experiments using samples of GAL::HA-pwp2 cells grown in galactose and glucose medium. During the characterization of the total RNA obtained for these experiments, we unexpectedly found that cells lacking Pwp2 have a major defect on the biogenesis of the 18 S rRNA. Accordingly, quantitative analysis of the rRNA content in GAL::HA-pwp2 cells showed that the 25/18 S ratio increases dramatically upon Pwp2 depletion (Fig. 2C). This observation was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis of total RNAs using probes specific for different mature rRNAs species. As seen in Fig. 2D, the loss of Pwp2 expression correlates with a progressive reduction of the 18 S rRNA species, while it does not affect the levels of 25 S, 5.8 SL, 5.8 SS, and 5 S rRNAs. To see the impact of this defect on the production of ribosomes, we evaluated the steady-state levels of these organelles in the presence or absence of Pwp2 in yeast cells. GAL::HA-pwp2 cells show a normal polysomal profile when grown in galactose medium, including normal levels of free ribosomal 40 and 60 S subunits, monosomes (80 S particles), and polysomes (Fig. 2E, right top panel). However, when shifted to glucose medium, these cells show a progressive reduction of free 40 S particles (Fig. 2E, lower panels), the ribosomal subunits that contain the 18 S rRNA. Interestingly, we also observed that the polysome content was significantly reduced in Pwp2-deficient cells despite the presence of relatively high amounts of apparently intact 80 S monosomes (Fig. 2E, lower panels). In agreement with the lack of effect on the 25 and 5.8 S rRNA contents (see Fig. 2D), the free pool of 60 S ribosomal subunits increases in GAL::HA-pwp2 cells grown in glucose and, at later time points, acquire levels even higher than those found at the 80 S peak (Fig. 2E, lower panels). The specific effect of Pwp2 on the biogenesis of the 40 S ribosomal subunit was further confirmed by densitometric quantitation of total ribosomal subunits separated under conditions of polysome runoff and low Mg2+. The A254 60/40 S ratios for the wild type and GAL::HA-pwp2 cells when grown in the presence of glucose and galactose are 1.2 and 1.6, respectively (Fig. 2F, first and second panels). This ratio increases up to 3.8 in GAL::HA-pwp2 cells growing in glucose (Fig. 2F, right panel). Wild type cells show no alterations in 40 S biosynthesis when transferred to glucose medium (Fig. 2, E and F), further confirming that those effects are due to the specific loss of Pwp2 expression rather than to an indirect effect derived from the culture conditions used. These results indicate that Pwp2 depletion leads to a specific reduction of 18 S rRNA levels and consequently to a 40 S ribosomal subunit deficit, which blocks normal ribosomal production. During the elaboration of this work, two groups independently identified Pwp2 as a component of the 90 S pre-ribosomal particle (16Grandi P. Rybin V. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Strauss D. Marzioch M.

Nature. 2002; 417: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we could demonstrate using both co-immunoprecipitation and gradient centrifugation experiments that Pwp2 is an integral part of the 90 S pre-ribosomal particle (see below).

https://openalex.org/W1963680604,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are peripheral membrane proteins that propagate signals from membrane receptors to regulatory proteins localized in distinct cellular compartments. To facilitate signal amplification, G proteins are in molar excess with respect to G protein-coupled receptors. Because G proteins are capable of translocating from membrane to cytosol, protein-lipid interactions play a crucial role in signal transduction. Here, we studied the binding of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) to model membranes (liposomes) and that of the entities formed upon receptor-mediated activation (Gα and Gβγ). The model membranes used were composed of defined membrane lipids capable of organizing into either lamellar or nonlamellar (hexagonal HII) membrane structures. We demonstrated that although heterotrimeric Gi proteins and Gβγ dimers can bind to lipid bilayers of phosphatidylcholine, their binding to membranes was markedly and significantly enhanced by the presence of nonlamellar phases of phosphatidylethanolamine. Conversely, activated G protein α subunits showed an opposite membrane binding behavior with a marked preference for lamellar membranes. These results have important consequences in cell signaling. First, the binding characteristics of the Gβγ dimer account for the lipid binding behavior and the cellular localization of heterotrimeric G proteins. Second, the distinct protein-lipid interactions of heterotrimeric G proteins, Gβγ dimers, and Gα subunits with membrane lipids explain, in part, their different cellular mobilizations during signaling upon receptor activation.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; HII, hexagonal II; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; HII, hexagonal II; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine. constitute the main class of membrane receptors and form the widest gene family known in the mammalian genome. Therefore, signal transduction via G proteins represents one of the most important ways of cell signaling (for a review, see Ref. 1Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Upon activation by agonists, GPCRs undergo conformational changes that induce the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, promoting the exchange of the GDP bound to the Gα subunit for GTP. This exchange provokes the dissociation of the Gα subunit from the Gβγ dimer and enables both molecular entities to modulate the activity of specific effectors or other signaling proteins (e.g. G protein receptor kinases). The association of both GPCRs and G proteins to the plasma membrane makes them susceptible to their lipid environment so that lipid-protein interactions are crucial to their function. In recent years, evidence has accumulated showing that the plasma membrane organization is more complex than a simple “chaotic sea” of bipolar lipid molecules in a liquid-crystalline state that only serves to support membrane proteins (2Vereb G. Szollosi J. Matko J. Nagy P. Farkas T. Vigh L. Matyus L. Waldmann T.A. Damjanovich S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8053-8058Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In fact, differentiated membrane domains with specific protein and lipid compositions can exist in a cell such as the basal and apical membranes of epithelial/endothelial cells, the pre- and postsynaptic membranes of neuronal synapses, or lipid rafts and caveolae. Moreover, the extracellular and cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane differ in their lipid composition (3Rothman J.E. Lenard J. Science. 1977; 195: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), further demonstrating the relevance of lipids in the organization and function of the membrane. Natural membranes are composed of different amphitropic molecules that differ in their propensity to form secondary lipid structures that influence the structural properties of the membrane (for a review, see Ref. 4Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this context, hexagonal (HII) structures regulate the localization and activity of some key membrane signaling proteins (5Giorgione J. Epand R.M. Buda C. Farkas T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9767-9770Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Escribá P.V. Ozaita A. Ribas C. Miralles A. Fodor E. Farkas T. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11375-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently been able to show that changes in the lipid composition of erythrocyte cell membranes can influence the membrane association of G proteins and protein kinase C in vivo (7Escribá P.V. Sanchez-Dominguez J.M. Alemany R. Perona J.S. Ruiz-Gutierrez V. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, the neural membranes of cold-adapted fishes contain higher levels of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species in winter than in summer (8Buda C. Dey I. Balogh N. Horvath L.I. Maderspach K. Juhasz M. Yeo Y.K. Farkas T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8234-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These lipid changes probably lower the solid-to-liquid and lamellar-to-hexagonal phase transition temperatures of membranes to maintain protein function and cell signaling in neurons and other cells. These data suggest that hexagonal phase propensity plays a major role in regulating physiological processes and might also participate in the control of other pivotal cellular events influenced by membrane proteins, such as cell growth or energy metabolism. Our main goal was to elucidate the role of the membrane lipid structure in the association to membranes of heterotrimeric G proteins and the molecular entities formed after their receptor-mediated activation. For this purpose we used synthetic membranes (liposomes) and purified G proteins as model systems because their lipid composition can be precisely controlled. We show that heterotrimeric Gi proteins (αβγ) and Gβγ dimers have protein-membrane lipid interactions distinct from those of Gαi monomers. These differences may explain their distinct cellular localizations after dissociation. We also show that the binding of the Gβγ dimer accounts for the binding characteristics and cellular localization of the complete heterotrimeric G protein. To our knowledge, this is the first work describing this new role of the G protein βγ dimer. 31P NMR—Multilamellar lipid vesicles (15%; w/w) were prepared mixing 56 mg of phospholipids with deuterated water (D2O). Either egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), bovine brain PE, or mixtures of both were prepared, keeping constant the lipid phosphorus content. The lipid suspensions were hydrated and homogenized with a pestle-type mini-homogenizer (Sigma) and submitted to vortex shaking until homogeneity. The suspensions were then submitted to 10 heating (60 °C) and freezing (–80 °C) cycles and equilibrated prior to data acquisition, as reported previously (9Funari S.S. Barceló F. Escribá P.V. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 567-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 31P NMR measurements were made in 5-mm tubes on an Advance-300 multinuclear NMR spectrometer (Bruker Instruments). Samples were equilibrated at the assay temperatures (4 or 25 °C) for 15 min before data was acquired. 31P NMR free induction decays were accumulated for 64 transients by employing a 4.4-μs, 90° radio-frequency pulse, a 24.3-kHz sweep width, and 65,000 data points. The delay between transients was 2 s, and the spectra were obtained by scanning from lower to higher temperatures. Liposome Preparation and G Protein Binding—Liposomes containing PC were prepared, with or without PE, by dissolving the lipids in chloroform and mixing the appropriate volumes in glass vials. The solvent was removed under argon, and the residue was dried for at least 3 h under vacuum. Subsequently, the lipid films were hydrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 containing 100 mm KCl and 0.1 mm EDTA at 42 °C for 1 h and subjected to vigorous vortex shaking every 15 min. Following five freeze/thaw cycles, this lipid emulsion was passed 11 times through a 400-nm polycarbonate membrane using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). The liposome emulsions were then diluted to a final concentration of 600 μm in lipid phosphorus, as determined by the method of Chen et al. (10Chen Jr., P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5834) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the liposomes were incubated with either 500 ng of purified heterotrimeric G proteins, 100 ng of the Gβγ dimer, or 150 ng of the Gαi1 subunit in a total volume of 300 μl for 30 min at 25 °C. Incubation of heterotrimeric G proteins or the Gαi1 subunit was carried out in the presence of 50 μm GDPβS or GTPγS, respectively. The unbound G proteins were then separated from the membranes by centrifugation at 62,000 × g for 45 min at 25 °C. Finally, the membrane pellets were resuspended in electrophoresis loading buffer (84 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Immunoblot Analysis and Quantification of Specific Immunoreactivity—Immunoblotting was performed as described elsewhere (11Escribá P.V. Sastre M. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1994; 51: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were submitted to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0,5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with the specific primary antibodies polyclonal anti-Gαi1/2 (dilution 1:5000) and anti-Gβ1 (1:1000) in fresh blocking solution. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and visualized with the ECL Western blot detection system and ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was performed by image analysis of the immunoreactive bands on the film. Values from liposomes composed of PC:PE were normalized to the values of pure PC liposomes, which were considered as 100%. Materials—Egg PC and liver PE were both purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Recombinant, purified, myristoylated Gαi1 protein subunit, purified heterotrimeric Gi protein, and purified Gβγ protein dimers were from Calbiochem. The polyclonal anti-Gαi1/2 antiserum was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and the monoclonal antibody anti-Gβ1 protein was obtained from BD Biosciences. All other reagents were supplied by Sigma. Data Analysis—The data shown are the mean values ± S.E. from the number of experiments indicated (n). Values were compared by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni comparison test against the control values. Differences between experimental groups were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Temperature-dependent Formation of Nonlamellar Phases in Model Membranes—For G protein-membrane binding experiments, model membranes of PC or PE or a combination of both (see “Experimental Procedures”) at different proportions were used. At 25 °C, egg PC membranes were organized forming lipid bilayers (lamellar structures), whereas bovine brain PE was mainly organized into hexagonal (HII phase) structures (Fig 1A). Membranes formed with different proportions of both lipids behaved as non-ideal mixtures, as has been described for many binary systems with two membrane lipids or more (for example, see Ref. 12Escribá P.V. Morales P. Smith A. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) where membrane domains enriched in one lipid species are formed. In this context, mixtures containing a higher content of PC (PC:PE at 10:0, 8:2, and 6:4; mol/mol) exhibited the peaks corresponding to the lamellar organization of each phospholipid (L1 and L2) (Fig. 1A). In addition, the shoulder at positive chemical shift values indicated the presence of a small proportion of nonlamellar phases in PE-containing samples. At greater proportions of PE (PC:PE at 4:6, 2:8 and 0:10; mol/mol), the occurrence of nonlamellar structures (NL1 and NL2, defined by the peaks at 0.10 and 5.94 ppm) increased at 25 °C with a concomitant decrease of the peaks corresponding to the lamellar phases (Fig. 1A). In contrast, at 4 °C there were only observed two peaks corresponding to the lamellar phases of PC and PE, respectively (–17.20 ppm and –12.20 ppm) (Fig 1B). Therefore, at 4 °C PC, PE, and their mixtures are organized into lamellar phases but not into nonlamellar phases. Binding of the Gi Heterotrimer to Model Membranes—We have studied the binding of heterotrimeric Gαi proteins to model membranes (liposomes) when the undissociated state was stabilized by the addition of GDPβS (50 μm). We found that the lipid composition of the liposome greatly influenced the binding affinity of Gi proteins. Particularly, the PE content of the membrane favored Gαβγ protein binding to membranes. The PE ratios used in these model membranes reflected conditions in different biological situations and natural membranes (PC:PE at 10:0, 8:2, 6:4, 4:6, and 0:10; mol/mol). In mammalian cells the overall percentage of PE is ∼20%, although the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane contains ∼40%. However, in some bacteria the PE content can reach up to 80% of the total membrane phospholipids. The presence of the hexagonal prone phospholipid PE, which organizes into HII phases under the experimental conditions used, induced an increase in the binding of Gi heterotrimers to liposomes in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Vesicles containing a ratio of 8:2 (120 μm PE) or 6:4 PC:PE (240 μm PE) (resembling mammalian plasma membranes or their inner leaflets) bound 338.5 ± 59.8 and 479.9 ± 51.7% of Gi protein heterotrimers, respectively. This was between 3- and 5-fold greater binding than that of vesicles composed of only the lamellar prone phospholipid PC (100%; Fig. 2A). Higher concentrations of PE (that may resemble certain membrane domains or bacterial membranes) induced even greater binding of heterotrimeric Gi proteins, reaching 705.5 ± 25.1% at a PC:PE molar ratio of 4:6 (360 μm PE) and 898.9 ± 58.6% for pure PE liposomes (600 μm PE). On the other hand, at 4 °C only lamellar and not hexagonal phases were formed in our model systems. Under these conditions, the binding of Gi heterotrimers to liposomes was approximately the same for all ratios of PC:PE used (8:2, 6:4, 4:6, and 0:10 at 116.0 ± 9.2, 116.3 ± 9.4, 122.1 ± 12.8, and 99.5 ± 11.3% with respect to PC:PE 10:0 as 100% control; p > 0.05 in all cases; Fig 2B). This result proofs that the observed increase in binding of the Gi heterotrimer is indeed caused by its binding preference to inverted hexagonal membrane structures and not by its preference for PE phospholipids. Binding of Gαi1 Subunit to Model Membranes—Similarly to the study with heterotrimeric G proteins, we also studied the binding of G protein subunits to liposomes to determine the membrane-lipid interactions that might occur upon G protein activation and dissociation. The purified Gαi1 protein used was myristoylated and therefore able to bind to membrane bilayers in a natural manner (13Jones T.L. Simonds W.F. Merendino Jr., J.J. Brann M.R. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Additionally, the presence of 50 μm GTPγS ensured that the protein remained in the conformation that corresponds to its activated state. By contrast to the heterotrimeric G proteins, the presence of the nonlamellar prone lipid PE (HII phases) did not increase the binding of monomeric Gαi1 subunits to the liposomes (Fig. 3). In fact, an increase in the membrane content of PE strongly inhibited the binding of Gαi1 monomers to membranes. Thus, vesicles containing 8:2 or 6:4 PC:PE (mol/mol) bound only 50.6 ± 15.5 or 33.0 ± 15.4% the amount of Gi monomer bound by pure PC membranes (lamellar) (Fig. 3A). Greater proportions of PE further reduced Gαi1 protein binding to 35.6 ± 5.4% for a ratio of 4:6 (mol/mol) and 26.1 ± 1.6% of control values for pure PE liposomes (Fig. 3A). At 4 °C, where only lamellar and not hexagonal phases are formed in our model system, binding of the Gi1 monomer to liposomes did not change with the ratios of PC:PE (8:2, 6:4, 4:6, and 0:10; mol/mol; 90.6 ± 6.4, 93.7 ± 4.3, 91.0 ± 1.5, and 85.3 ± 4.1%, with respect to PC:PE at 10:0 as 100% control; Fig 3B), showing that the observed decrease in binding of the Gαi1 subunit was indeed caused by its binding preference for lamellar membrane structures and not by its preference for PC species. These results demonstrate that the Gαi1 monomer interacts better with lamellar phases (i.e. planar membranes and lipid bilayers) than with hexagonal (HII phase) structures (i.e. membrane structures with negative curvature). Binding of Gβγ Dimer to Model Membranes—Finally, we investigated the protein-lipid interactions of the Gβγ dimer, which revealed lipid binding characteristics more similar to those of heterotrimeric Gi proteins than to those of monomeric Gαi1 subunits. Thus, the binding of Gβγ subunits was significantly and markedly augmented as the PE content in the model membrane increased (Fig. 4). Gβγ subunit binding to model membranes with molar ratios of PC:PE at 6:4 and 2:8 increased to 403.2 ± 58.8 and 1575.0 ± 316.5% that of pure PC lipid bilayers, respectively. These results clearly show that the Gβγ dimer has a marked preference for hexagonal (HII phase) structures. Receptor-mediated signaling pathways operate as signal amplification cascades. In signals propagated from GPCRs, the first amplification step occurs at the membrane where each receptor can activate several G proteins upon agonist binding. However, rather than being homogeneously distributed on the cell surface, GPCRs and many other membrane receptors are concentrated or clustered in defined membrane regions (14Franco R. Casado V. Ciruela F. Mallol J. Lluis C. Canela E.I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3007-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Isenberg W.M. McEver R.P. Phillips D.R. Shuman M.A. Bainton D.F. Am. J. Anat. 1989; 185: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, a large number of inactive, GDP-bound, heterotrimeric G protein molecules must be available in these receptor-rich domains associated with membrane lipids. Although the protein-lipid interactions between Gα subunits and lamellar membranes have been thoroughly studied (16Yang S. Zhang L. Huang Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), little emphasis had been placed on the possible interactions with nonlamellar lipid phases. Here, we have investigated the different interactions of Gα, Gβγ, and Gαβγ proteins with lamellar and nonlamellar (HII) lipid phases. As a result, we have demonstrated that the presence of nonlamellar phases formed by PE favors the binding of heterotrimeric Gi proteins and Gβγ dimers to membranes, whereas Gαi subunits prefer lamellar membrane structures formed by PC and/or PE. Cell membranes are usually rich in PE, which is mainly distributed on the protoplasmic face of the plasma membrane where high concentrations of G proteins are bound (17Cullis P.R. Hope M.J. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1991: 1-41Google Scholar). Indeed, our results show that the greater the hexagonal phase propensity, the higher the affinity of heterotrimeric Gi proteins for membranes. Thus, PE-rich domains or regions with negative curvature strain, in either a stable or a transient manner, could act as membrane reservoirs for these peripheral proteins. This finding is in agreement with the observed loss of G proteins from brain plasma membranes after the disruption of nonlamellar HII structures by the anthracycline daunomycin (18Escribá P.V. Sastre M. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nonlamellar prone lipids modulate the physical properties of lipid bilayers, inducing membrane “defects” such as changes in the intrinsic monolayer curvature, the surface pressure, and the hydration of membranes (19Basñez G. Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15183-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of PEs in membranes under physiological conditions could justify the presence of HII structures or regions with negative curvature in vivo, which might be stabilized or induced by certain membrane proteins (20Perkins W.R. Dause R.B. Parente R.A. Minchey S.R. Neuman K.C. Gruner S.M. Taraschi T.F. Janoff A.S. Science. 1996; 273: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that peptides with α-helical structures, such as the transmembrane regions of GPCRs, promote the formation of hexagonal phases under certain conditions (21van der Wel P.C. Pott T. Morein S. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3124-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that PEs facilitate the conformational change of the GPCR rhodopsin to its activated state in model membranes (22Botelho A.V. Gibson N.J. Thurmond R.L. Wang Y. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6354-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, regions enriched in hexagonal phase-forming membrane lipids like PE could provide a platform for the spatial co-localization of GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting a dual role for hexagonal prone lipids in signal transduction, namely membrane co-localization of the signaling components and participation in GPCR activation (see below). In contrast to G protein heterotrimers, the activated monomeric Gαi1 subunit shows a marked preference for lamellar structures. This would provoke the rapid exit of activated Gαi1 monomers from the receptor environment where the hexagonal phase propensity is increased by the transmembrane domains of GPCRs and the isoprenyl modifications of the Gγ subunit peptides. This mobilization of the Gα protein subunit away from the receptor environment may facilitate its interaction with effector proteins (e.g. adenylyl cyclase) that might be present in other membrane domains. Indeed, Gαi and Gαs have been found in lipid rafts (23Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), domains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, with a highly ordered lamellar state and almost gel-like physical properties. Our findings demonstrate that monomeric Gαi1 subunits have a much greater affinity for microdomains with lamellar organization, such as those formed in lipid rafts. However, the lipid preferences of G proteins could be attributed to specific interactions with phospholipid polar heads in a lipid structure-independent manner. Therefore, we also studied the binding of these proteins to the same membrane systems at 4 °C. Whereas at 25 °C PE forms nonlamellar phases, at 4 °C it is only organized into lipid bilayers both alone or in combination with PC. At this temperature, neither Gαβγ nor Gα had a preference for PE or PC, respectively. This binding behavior is markedly distinct from that observed at 25 °C and demonstrates that G protein binding to membranes is regulated by the membrane structure and not by interactions with specific phospholipids (e.g. PC or PE). In keeping with this suggestion, the G protein transducin (Gαt) that couples to the GPCR rhodopsin also translocates to lipid rafts when activated (24Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It therefore seems feasible that the opposite binding preferences of activated Gα subunits target them away from the receptor environment to other membrane areas where they may interact with their effectors. The fact that a variety of proteins of the signal transduction machinery are located in lipid rafts supports this idea (25Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 26Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, lipid rafts could serve as platforms to enhance the effectiveness of the second step of the signaling cascade by promoting the spatial association between Gα subunits and their effectors. The high affinity of Gβγ subunits for hexagonal prone membranes also influences their distribution in native membranes. The present results are in agreement with the exclusion of Gβγ subunits from synthetic lipid rafts reported by Moffet et al. (27Moffett S. Brown D.A. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Our data strongly suggest that the Gβγ dimer is responsible for the lipid-protein interaction properties of heterotrimeric G proteins. In this sense, the Gβγ dimer defines the hexagonal phase preference of complete Gαβγ heterotrimers, thereby masking the lamellar membrane affinity of the Gα subunit. Therefore, one of the functions of the Gβγ dimer could be to carry the Gα subunit to the vicinity of the GPCR, similar to the “piggyback” transport to nuclei of proteins lacking a nuclear localization sequence by another proteins containing such a sequence (28Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 29Kang K.I. Devin J. Cadepond F. Jibard N. Guichon-Mantel A. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The hexagonal (HII phase) preference of the Gβγ dimer could also be important for GPCR desensitization, which occurs after agonist-mediated GPCR activation. Dissociated Gβγ dimers can bind G protein-coupled receptor kinases, which phosphorylate and inactivate GPCRs. The affinity of the Gβγ dimer for nonlamellar membrane regions (where membrane receptors are concentrated) would guide these kinases to their targets, provoking the termination of the signaling process initiated by the binding of the agonist to the receptor. The involvement of membrane lipids other than PC in the regulation of GPCR phosphorylation and desensitization strongly supports this hypothesis. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that, with the exception of PC, membrane lipids can indeed regulate G protein-coupled receptor kinase activity (30DebBurman S.K. Ptasienski J. Boetticher E. Lomasney J.W. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5742-5747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In summary, the results presented here introduce new concepts about GPCR-associated signal propagation. Both GPCRs and prenylated G protein γ subunits facilitate the formation of hexagonal phase membrane domains (Fig. 5). Thus, these nonlamellar membrane domains would be enriched in Gαβγ proteins because of the higher affinity of these heterotrimers for membranes with negative curvature driven by the Gβγ dimer. Therefore, a pool of G proteins would be generated near GPCR membrane receptors. Upon agonist-mediated activation, each GPCR receptor molecule can activate several G proteins, and the activated Gα subunit dissociates from the Gβγ complex. Because of its reduced affinity for nonlamellar membrane structures, activated Gα protein monomers would translocate away from the receptor area to planar bilayer membrane regions (i.e. highly ordered lamellar phases) such as lipid rafts. In these specialized microdomains, the accumulation of effector proteins would facilitate their interaction with activated Gα subunits and, therefore, the efficient propagation of the transmitted signal. Because the Gβγ dimer exhibits a higher affinity for nonlamellar lipid phases, it may regulate signaling effectors or enable G protein-coupled receptor kinases to interact with the membrane receptors. The latter process is associated with receptor phosphorylation, which induces GPCR desensitization. In general, our results highlight the functional relevance of structural biology for signal transduction, not only in terms of proteins and protein-protein interaction but also with respect to lipid organization and lipid-protein interactions."

The 2-5A system is modulated by 5′-triphosphorylated, 2′,5′-phosphodiester-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), which are synthesized by 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (2′,5′-OASs), inactivated by 5′-phosphatase and completely degraded by 2′-phosphodiesterase (2′-PDE). Generated 2-5A activates 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease, RNase L, which induces RNA degradation in cells and finally apoptosis. Although 2′,5′-OASs and RNase L have been molecularly cloned and studied well, the identification of 2′-PDE has remained elusive. Here, we describe the first identification of 2′-PDE, the third key enzyme of the 2-5A system. We found a putative 2′-PDE band on SDS-PAGE by successive six-step chromatographies from ammonium sulfate precipitates of bovine liver and identified a partial amino acid sequence of the human 2′-PDE by mass spectrometry. Based on the full-length sequence of the human 2′-PDE obtained by in silico expressed sequence tag assembly, the gene was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. The recombinant human 2′-PDE expressed in mammalian cells certainly cleaved the 2′,5′-phosphodiester bond of 2-5A trimer and 2-5A analogs. Because no sequences with high homology to this human 2′-PDE were found, the human 2′-PDE was considered to be a unique enzyme without isoform. Suppression of 2′-PDE by a small interfering RNA and a 2′-PDE inhibitor resulted in significant reduction of viral replication, whereas overexpression of 2′-PDE protected cells from IFN-induced antiproliferative activity. These observations identify 2′-PDE as a key regulator of the 2-5A system and as a potential novel target for antiviral and antitumor treatments.

IFNs are multifunctional cytokines with important roles in antiviral activity, cell growth, cell differentiation, and immunomodulation (1Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H.

The 2-5A system is well known as one of the major pathways induced by IFNs, in which unusual oligoadenylates, referred to as 2-5A, modulate RNA degradation in cells (3Player M.R. Torrence P.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 55-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). 2-5A comprises 5′-triphosphorylated oligoadenylates containing adenosines linked with a 2′-5′-phosphodiester bond (pppA(2′pA)n, where n ≥ 2), which is resistant to most known RNases (4Kerr I.M.

A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The 2-5A system is composed of three kinds of enzymes: 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (2′,5′-OASs) activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which produce 2-5A from ATP (6Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); 2′-phosphodiesterase (2′-PDE), which degrades 2-5A to AMP and ATP (7Schmidt A. Zilberstein A. Shulman L. Federman P. Berissi H. Revel M. FEBS Lett. 1978; 95: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); and RNase L activated by 2-5A, which degrades RNA, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis sometimes leading cells to apoptosis (8Zhou A.

Because RNase L is expressed constitutively in a wide variety of cells, the amount of 2-5A is believed to be a primary factor that controls RNase L activity in the 2-5A system (3Player M.R.

Biochem. 1978; 92: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 5′-Phosphatase is indicated to have a role in the 2-5A system because the 5′-unphosphorylated 2-5A core has significantly reduced ability to activate RNase L (9Dong B.

Since complete inactivation of 2-5A is only accomplished by cleavage of the 2′-5′ bond (9Dong B. Xu L. Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Lee X. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. J. Biol.

Viral infection of cells induces the secretion of IFNs which up-regulate 2′,5′-OASs severalfold to several hundredfold (3Player M.R. Torrence P.F. Pharmacol.

Because viral infection frequently results in production of dsRNA, the amount of 2-5A in the infected cells is increased preferentially. As a result of RNA degradation by activated RNase L, the viral replication in the infected cells is suppressed by inhibition of protein synthesis and/or apoptosis (3Player M.R. Torrence P.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 55-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR).

It is of interest that RNase L and other proteins in the 2-5A system have a function in counteracting prostate cancer (21Silverman R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Among enzymes in the 2-5A system, 2′,5′-OASs and RNase L have been molecularly cloned and studied well (3Player M.R.

Although characterization of 2′-PDE such as substrate specificity using a purified enzyme has been investigated (27Schmidt A. Chernajovsky Y. Shulman L. Federman P. Berissi H. Revel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4788-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Johnston M.I. Hearl W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8377-8382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), molecular characterization of 2′-PDE has remained to be elucidated. To understand the molecular mechanism and biological role of the 2-5A system more precisely, identification of 2′-PDE is indispensable. In this study, we partially purified 2′-PDE from bovine liver and molecularly cloned the human homologous protein. Overexpression of human 2′-PDE suppressed antiproliferative activity of IFNs and dsRNA. Moreover, suppression of 2′-PDE by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a 2′-PDE inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity. Our findings suggest 2′-PDE as a potential novel target for therapeutics against replication of viruses and development of tumors. Purification and Identification of 2′-PDE from Bovine Liver—All purification steps were conducted at 4 °C. A portion of bovine liver (200 g, Tokyo Shibaura Zouki) was homogenized in 700 ml of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The 30-50% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitates of the supernatant were collected, dissolved in 200 ml of HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture (complete, Roche Applied Science)), and dialyzed against 10 liters of HEPES buffer for 3 h followed by a change of buffer to 10 liters of HEPES buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The dialyzed sample was filtered and loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction column (HiPrep 16/10 Phenyl FF (High sub), Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 2-0 m NaCl in HEPES buffer. The active fractions were then serially purified on an affinity column (HiTrap Blue HP 5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl, an anion exchange column (Resource Q 1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl and an anion exchange column (Mono Q PC 1.6/5, Amersham Biosciences) in HEPES/CHAPS buffer (HEPES buffer containing 0.05% CHAPS). Between each step, the active fractions were dialyzed against the HEPES/CHAPS buffer. A portion of the active fraction from the Mono Q column was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with HEPES/CHAPS buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. A portion of the active fractions from the Mono Q column and the gel filtration column was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reduced conditions, and the gel was stained with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes) and scanned by Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). The 2′-PDE activity was measured by NH3 assay as described below, and the protein concentration was determined by the modified Bradford method (Coomassie Plus Protein Assay, Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The band on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was excised, and the protein in the gel was reduced, alkylated, and digested as described previously (29Kubota K. Sakikawa C. Katsumata M. Nakamura T. Wakabayashi K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The resultant peptides were subjected to reverse-phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (30Kubota K. Wakabayashi K. Matsuoka T. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The tandem mass spectra were searched against the GenBank non-redundant protein data base using the Mascot program (Matrix Sciences). Molecular Cloning of Human 2′-PDE—To obtain the full-length sequence of human 2′-PDE, we performed a BLAST search against the human EST data base using the corresponding nucleotide sequence of BAB85079.1 (AK074423.1, GenBank) as a query. We found a series of EST fragments with obvious identity. By assembling these EST sequences (AK074423.1, BM894197.1, H06019.1, and H42112.1, all in GenBank), we obtained a virtual longest nucleotide sequence (1,939 bp, AB115695, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank), which revealed an open reading frame predicted to encode 609 amino acids with the C-terminal extension of BAB85079.1. The cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II reverse transcription (RT) Kit, Invitrogen) from human liver poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech), and the assembled nucleotide sequence of human 2′-PDE was amplified by PCR using a 5′-primer (5′-CTCCTCAGCTCCACCTGACAGTAGG-3′), a 3′-primer (5′-TACTTCCTTTTCAGACTTCAATTCC-3′) and KOD-plus (Toyobo). The resulting PCR product was then cloned into a pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the sequence was confirmed using an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Construction of Classification Tree—The human proteins containing the PF03372 domain (31Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) in the Swiss Protein data base and the human hypothetical proteins with 20-30% identity to human 2′-PDE in GenBank data bases were retrieved. Partial sequences corresponding to the PF03372 domain were extracted from these proteins and subjected to multiple alignment using ClustalW (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56228) Google Scholar). A dendrogram was subsequently drawn using the Treeview program. Expression Analysis of 2′-PDE Transcript—The expression profile of 2′-PDE in human tissues was determined by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed with RNA from 24 human tissues using a 5′-primer (5′-GTCATCAATGGCAGCATTCCAGAG-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-TAAATCACATACAAGTGC-3′). Poly(A)+ RNA of the human adult adrenal gland, bone marrow, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, placenta, prostate, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid, trachea, uterus, fetal brain, fetal kidney, and fetal liver were purchased from Clontech, and human adult colon was from BioChain Institute. The amplified DNA (309 bp) was subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Northern blot analysis was performed for various cell lines. Total RNA from the cells was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 15 μg of the RNA was loaded and separated on 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). About a 1-kbp fragment of the human 2′-PDE cDNA or human β-actin cDNA was 32P labeled using Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling Kit (Amersham Biosciences), and then the membrane was hybridized with these probes in ExpressHyb buffer (Clontech). The expression levels of each mRNA were determined using a bioimage analyzer (Fujix BAS2000, Fujifilm). Expression of Human 2′-PDE in Mammalian Cells—The open reading frame of the full-length human 2′-PDE was subcloned into the expression vector pEF6/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen), which encodes human 2′-PDE with the C-terminal V5 epitope and His6 (V5-His) tags. 20 μg of the DNA was transfected into semiconfluent COS-1 cells (1 × 106 cells) using 30 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). As a negative control, an equal amount of pEF6/V5-His-TOPO/LacZ (Invitrogen) and FuGENE 6, or only FuGENE 6, was transfected into the COS-1 cells. The transfected cells were cultured for 72 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with CelLytic-M (Sigma) containing 1 mm DTT and protease inhibitor mixture at 25 °C for 5 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at -80 °C until use. For experiments to determine 2′-PDE activity in the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay or analysis, recombinant human 2′-PDE with V5-His tags was partially purified using a HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) and used as an enzyme source. 2′-PDE Activity Assay—We measured 2′-PDE activity by monitoring the NH3 amount (NH3 assay) or using HPLC (HPLC assay). In the NH3 assay, 10 μl of sample was added to 40 μl of HEPES buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1.5 mm A2′pA (Seikagaku), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The produced adenosine was converted to inosine and NH3 at 37 °C for 20 min by adding 10 μl of 0.5 m succinic acid, pH 6.0, containing 3.5 μg/ml adenosine deaminase (Sigma) and 2.5 m KCl. The NH3 produced was assayed with an ammonia test kit (Wako Pure Chemicals). One unit/ml 2′-PDE activity was defined as the concentration required for 1 mm adenosine production. 3′-PDE activity was determined by using 1.5 mm A3′pA (Seikagaku) in place of A2′pA. In the HPLC assay, 80 μl of 0.75 mm A2′pA in the assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2), 10 μl of partially purified human 2′-PDE, and 10 μl of inhibitor dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were mixed with 200 μl of methanol to inactivate the enzyme, and 10 μl of the filtrate (0.45 μm) was subjected to a C18 column (Inertsil ODS-2, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm, GL Science) and analyzed with isocratic elution in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 5% acetonitrile. Absorbance at 260 nm was monitored, and 2′-PDE activity was determined by measuring the decreased peak area of A2′pA. HPLC Analysis of Degradation of 2-5A Trimer by Recombinant 2′-PDE—2-5A trimer, pppA2′pA2′pA, was enzymatically synthesized by chicken 2′,5′-OAS (33Yamamoto A. Iwata A. Koh Y. Kawai S. Murayama S.

As a negative control, pppA2′pA2′pA was incubated for 7 h with 10 μl of H2O instead of the enzyme. The samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme and centrifuged briefly, and 50 μl of the supernatant was subjected to a C18 column (XTerra MS C18,5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm, Waters) with a guard column (3.9 × 20 mm) of the same material equilibrated with 50 mm triethylamine acetate, pH 7.0. After injection, the column was washed with the same buffer for 5 min, and the nucleotides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-10% acetonitrile over 20 min. Absorbance at 260 nm was monitored, and each eluted peak was fractionated and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Peaks corresponding to AMP and ATP were further confirmed using standards. Protection from IFN- or dsRNA-induced Cell Death in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Expressing 2′-PDE—Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (all from Invitrogen) in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To establish stable clones expressing 2′-PDE, a human 2′-PDE cDNA fragment was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pEF-DEST51 containing the blasticidin-resistant determinant to express 2′-PDE with C-terminal V5-His tags. The resulting construct was introduced into PC-3 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), and then the blasticidin-resistant transformants were selected in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml blasticidin S. Stable transformant colonies were isolated and confirmed by Western blot analyses. Whole cell extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After having been blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical), the membrane was incubated first with indicated antibodies to a V5 epitope tag (Invitrogen) or actin (Oncogene), and then with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by an ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For the cell viability assay, cells (3.0 × 103 cells/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates in a volume of 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. After incubating the cells with IFN-α (Cosmo Bio), IFN-γ (R&D Systems), or dsRNA (poly(dI·dC), Amersham Biosciences) for 3 days, cell viability was determined using AlamarBlue reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE). Transfection of siRNA, Quantitative Real Time PCR, and Virus Infection Assay—HeLa cells (1 × 105 cells) were grown in semiconfluent monolayers on a 24-well plate (collagen type I-coated, Asahi Techno Glass) in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection of siRNA (20 pmol) into HeLa cells was accomplished using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), and the cells were cultured for 24 h. siRNAs for the human 2′-PDE (5′-GUACAAGGUGGAGCGCAACdTdT-3′ and 5′-GUUGCGCUCCACCUUGUACdTdT-3′) and unrelated protein (mouse carboxyl esterase 3, 5′-GGUGCUCUCAGAGCUCUUCdTdG-3′ and 5′-GAAGAGCUCUGAGAGCACCdTdG-3′) were obtained from Dharmacon. After replacing the medium with 250 μl of MEM containing 2.5% FBS, the cells were cultured for 24 h with or without 300 units/well IFN-α (EMD Biosciences). After changing the medium to fresh MEM containing 2.5% FBS, the cells were infected or noninfected with vaccinia virus (WR strain, multiplicity of infection = 0.001), cultured for 24 h, and subjected to analysis of the 2′-PDE transcript and viral replication. For quantification of 2′-PDE mRNA in HeLa cells, total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) and Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase in a final volume of 20 μl. Real time PCR amplifications were performed from 5 μl of cDNA diluted 1:125 by using gene-specific primer sets as follows: 2′-PDE forward, 5′-GTCATCAATGGCAGCATTCCAGAG-3′; 2′-PDE reverse, 5′-CTATTTCCATTTTAAATCACATACAAGTGC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-CATTGCTCCTCCTGAGCGCAA-3′; β-actin reverse, 5′-CTGCGCAAGTTAGGTTTTGTC-3′. Each primer set was used at a concentration of 300 nm in a final volume of 50 μl using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). All PCRs were performed on a sequence detection system (ABI Prism 7900HT, Applied Biosystems), and quantification of a given gene was calculated after normalization to β-actin. The specificity of the PCR amplification was verified by melt curve analysis of the final products directly in the sequence detector and by agarose gel electrophoresis. To determine viral replication, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with absolute ethanol at 25 °C for 10 min, and dried. The procedure for visualization of infected cells by peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining was described previously (36Okuno Y. Tanaka K. Baba K. Maeda A. Kunita N. Ueda S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used with some modifications. The fixed cells were treated successively with rabbit anti-vaccinia virus antibody (1:500, Virostat, Portland, ME), goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:1,000, DakoCytomation), and peroxidase-rabbit antiperoxidase complex (1:1,000, DakoCytomation) for 60 min each. The peroxidase reaction was conducted for 5 min using a liquid DAB Substrate-Chromogen System (DakoCytomation). The plaque numbers were counted visually, and the antiviral effects were normalized using the plaque numbers of virus infection only as 100%. Effect of 2′-PDE Inhibitor on Virus Infection Assay—The effect of a 2′-PDE inhibitor on the virus infection assay was determined in a manner similar to that of siRNA. Semiconfluent HeLa cells on a 24-well plate grown in MEM with 2.5% FBS were treated with or without 300 units/well IFN-α in MEM with 2.5% FBS for 24 h. The medium was changed with fresh MEM containing 2.5% FBS and an inhibitor, and the cells were infected with vaccinia virus (WR strain, multiplicity of infection = 0.001). After 24 h of culture, the degree of viral infection was determined using peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining as described above. Statistical Analysis—Comparison of two groups was analyzed by the two-tailed unpaired Student t test and the dose effects were evaluated by the Dunnett test. Purification and Identification of 2′-PDE—We developed two assays for detecting 2′-PDE activity, an NH3 assay and an HPLC assay. In the NH3 assay, the pr"

Thus, the inhibition kinetics of oxypurinol for XO was determined using saturating concentrations of xanthine. When XO was bound to a prototypical GAG, heparin-Sepharose 6B (HS6B-XO), the rate of inactivation for uric acid formation from xanthine was less than that for XO in solution (kinact = 0.24 versus 0.39 min–1). Additionally, the overall inhibition constant (Ki) of oxypurinol for HS6B-XO was 2–5-fold greater than for free XO (451 versus 85 nm). Univalent electron flux ( O2·¯ formation) was diminished by the binding of XO to heparin from 28.5% for free XO to 18.7% for GAG-immobilized XO. Similar to the results obtained with HS6B-XO, the binding of XO to bovine aortic endothelial cells rendered the enzyme resistant to inhibition by oxypurinol, achieving ∼50% inhibition.

Xanthine oxidoreductase is a molybdenum-pterin protein that serves as the rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and, finally, to urate. Upon sulfhydryl oxidation or limited proteolysis, the dehydrogenase form of xanthine oxidoreductase (xanthine dehydrogenase) is converted to an oxidase (xanthine oxidase or XO), which utilizes O2 as the terminal e– acceptor, yielding superoxide ( O2·¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than NADH. Under inflammatory conditions, XO serves as a significant source of O2·¯ and H2O2 in the vasculature (4Aslan M. Ryan T.M. Adler B. Townes T.M. Parks D.A. Thompson J.A. Tousson A. Gladwin M.T.

During such states, it has been demonstrated that xanthine dehydrogenase is released into the circulation, is rapidly (<1 min) converted to XO, and binds with high affinity (Kd = 6 nm) to positively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (9Houston M.

Beckman J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G768-G774PubMed Google Scholar). In this location, XO can generate ROS that, in turn, can modulate the bioavailability of nitric oxide (·NO) and, thus, vascular cell signaling (8White C.R. Darley-Usmar V. Berrington W.R. McAdams M.

Xanthine oxidase displays an affinity for heparin sulfate-containing GAGs on endothelial cells; intravenous administration of heparin results in increases in plasma XO activity, suggesting that XO is bound to the vascular endothelium in both humans and animal models of disease (9Houston M.

Sequestration of proteins by GAGs does the following: 1) increases their local concentration by up to an order of magnitude; 2) diminishes their rotational and translational mobility; and 3) limits the diffusion of substrates and products, thus creating a microenvironment that differs significantly from the experimental conditions typically used to determine the kinetics of substrate and inhibitor association (13Camejo G.

The binding of XO to heparin-Sepharose affects the kinetics of enzyme activation to result in an increased Km for xanthine, alters the properties of both product- and substrate-dependent enzyme inhibition with increases in Ki for xanthine, uric acid and guanine, and also limits superoxide dismutase scavenging of XO-derived O2·¯ (14Radi R. Rubbo H. Bush K. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that elevations in circulating XO will result in subsequent endothelial association of the enzyme with a prolonged production of ROS that may be relatively resistant to catalytic scavengers. Allopurinol, a pyrazolo-based suicide inhibitor of XO, has been used for several decades in the treatment of hyperuricemia. Recent reports demonstrate that allopurinol administration is also beneficial in both clinical situations and animal models of vascular disease (8White C.R. Darley-Usmar V. Berrington W.R. McAdams M.

Because endothelial associated XO plays a critical role in oxidant-mediated vascular dysfunction and because GAG association clearly alters the kinetics of enzyme activation, the inhibition kinetics of oxypurinol (the more water soluble and active metabolite of allopurinol) toward XO immobilized by heparin and vascular endothelial cell GAGs was investigated and compared with oxypurinol inhibition kinetics of XO in solution. Materials—Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and PD10 G25 Sephadex columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Xanthine, native cytochrome c, and oxypurinol were from Sigma. Medium 199 and serum were from Invitrogen. Xanthine Oxidase Purification and Binding to Heparin-Sepharose 6B—Xanthine oxidase was purified from fresh bovine cream and stored in ammonium sulfate at 4 °C (18Waud W.R. Brady F.O. Wiley R.D. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase was bound to HS6B as described previously (14Radi R. Rubbo H. Bush K. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, XO (2 mg/ml) was added to a fixed amount of gel (0.05 g, dry weight), and the mixture was stirred gently in 5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4 (2-ml final volume) at 25 °C for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min and washed, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4. Enzyme Analysis—Enzyme activity was determined as the rate of uric acid formation at 292 nm in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4 (ϵ = 11 mm–1 cm–1) using a Shimadzu UV 2401PC spectrophotometer. Reaction mixtures consisted of 2 milliunits of HS6B-XO and varying concentrations of xanthine in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4. Reactions were initiated by the addition of xanthine and maintained under continuously stirred conditions at 25 °C. Univalent flux was measured as the proportion of superoxide ( O2·¯) (one electron reduction) versus H2O2 (two electron reduction) generated from O2 by XO. The production of O2·¯ was measured indirectly by O2·¯ reduction of cytochrome c (19McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 243: 5753-5760Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For analysis of enzyme reactivation kinetics, the reduced oxypurinol-XO complex was prepared by incubating 1 ml of XO-HS6B (2.8 mg/ml in 5 mm potassium Pi containing 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at 25 °C with an excess of dithionite and 100 μm oxypurinol for 20 min under N2, centrifuging, washing, and resuspending (20Spector T. Hall W.W. Krenitsky T.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 3109-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine reactivation constants, purified oxypurinol-reduced XO complex in 5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, with 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 and 200 μm xanthine. At various time points, aliquots were removed, and XO activity was determined as described above. First-order reactivation constants (kreact) were calculated from the slope of plots of ln(1 – v1/v0) versus time of incubation (20Spector T. Hall W.W. Krenitsky T.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 3109-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cellular Studies—Bovine aortic endothelial cells were isolated as described previously (21Poss W.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Panus P.C. Freeman B.A. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L941-L946PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cell culture, routine passage, and experimental manipulations were all conducted in the absence of proteases. Cells were propagated by subculturing at a 1:4 ratio in medium 199 containing 5% fetal calf serum, 5% iron-supplemented and defined calf serum, and 10 μm thymidine in 75-cm2 flasks. Upon reaching confluence, the medium was replaced with fresh medium (medium 199(–) formulated without xanthine and hypoxanthine) containing XO (5 milliunits/ml) for 1 h. The XO-containing media were removed, cells were washed, fresh medium 199(–) was added that contained designated concentrations of oxypurinol, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 μm xanthine for 1 h. Xanthine oxidase activity was determined by measuring uric acid formation via high pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection as described previously (9Houston M. Estevez A. Chumley P. Aslan M. Marklund S. Parks D.A. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4985-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Uricase activity, as determined by the addition of known concentrations of uric acid in medium with or without cells (37 °C) and then monitoring the loss of uric acid over time, was undetectable. Statistics—Data were analyzed for statistically significant differences using a one way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's range test for the multiple pairwise comparisons. Inhibition of Uric Acid and Superoxide Formation—Oxypurinol inhibited both free and HS6B-XO in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion; however, the extent of XO inhibition by oxypurinol was less for the HS6B-immobilized enzyme at any given xanthine concentration (Fig. 1). Complete inhibition of the HS6B-immobilized enzyme was not attainable at clinically relevant concentrations of inhibitor (<90 μm; see Table III); rates of uric acid production at 75 μm oxypurinol did not differ from those at 20 μm (not shown).Table IIIPlasma levels of xanthine oxidase, xanthine / hypoxanthine, and oxypurinol in various human pathologic conditionsCompoundPlasma ConcentrationNormalDiseaseXanthine Oxidase0.2 microunits/ml (32Yamamoto T.

Free XO displayed a greater proportion of univalent flux than did HS6B-XO in the absence of inhibitor (Table I).

The kinact for free XO was greater than HS6B-XO at 10 μm xanthine and saturating XO concentrations, indicating that HS6B-XO was inhibited more slowly by oxypurinol than by free XO.

Hypoxanthine, xanthine, and allopurinol all provide this reductive function toward molybdenum. Dithionite can also reduce XO, permitting full oxypurinol association, XO inhibition, and determination of rates of spontaneous and xanthine-dependent reactivation (Fig. 3 and Table II). Spontaneous reactivation of HS6B-XO (0.0016 min–1) was 10-fold slower than the reported value for free XO (∼ 0.018 min–1) (20Spector T. Hall W.W. Krenitsky T.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 3109-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The addition of xanthine increased HS6B-XO reactivation in a concentration-dependent manner with kreact values of 0.0048 and 0.0288 min–1 at 10 and 200 μm xanthine, respectively. From these data, an overall inhibition constant (Ki) was determined for HS6B-XO at low and saturating xanthine concentrations, with a Ki 2–5-fold greater than that obtained for free XO (Table II). Inhibition of Cell-associated XO—To add cell biological context to the observation that GAG immobilization of XO results in resistance to oxypurinol inhibition, the extent of oxypurinol inhibition of bovine aortic endothelial cell XO was determined following exposure of cells to XO (Fig. 4). Comparable with GAG-bound XO, oxypurinol-dependent inhibition of uric acid formation in XO-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells was significantly less than for free XO. Increasing oxypurinol concentration up to 400 μm, far exceeding typical therapeutic concentrations (< 90 μm), showed no additional XO inhibition (see Table III). Although XO exhibits a net negative charge at physiological pH, cationic amino acid motifs on the surface of the protein result in its high affinity for negatively charged GAGs (Kd = 6 nm) (9Houston M.

This association alters its kinetic properties, increasing the Km and Ki for substrates and products when compared with XO in solution because of a decrease in binding affinity (14Radi R. Rubbo H. Bush K. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In healthy humans, plasma xanthine plus hypoxanthine levels are typically 2 μm, suggesting that immobilized XO would manifest reduced enzymatic activity (Km = 21.2 μm for xanthine). However, during a variety of pathologic conditions, plasma xanthine plus hypoxanthine concentrations can rise to 20–100 μm, a range sufficient to reach and exceed half-maximal activity for the immobilized enzyme (Table III). Such increases in substrate concentration, coupled with a potential immobilization-induced increase in XO stability, indicate that XO bound to vascular cell GAGs could serve as an important source of ROS. In support of this finding, treatment with allopurinol improved vascular function both in animal models and in clinical vascular diseases such as diabetes and heart failure, where endothelial-associated XO is implicated as a significant source of ROS (8White C.R. Darley-Usmar V. Berrington W.R. McAdams M. Gore J.Z. Thompson J.A. Parks D.A. Tarpey M.M. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Circulation. 2002; 106: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Although there is an abundance of data regarding the impact of pyrazolo XO inhibitors such as allopurinol or oxypurinol on hyperuricemia, information on the effect of the production of uric acid and ROS when GAGs immobilize XO is limited. In humans, allopurinol (plasma half-life is 1–3 h) is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, oxypurinol, which persists with a plasma half-life of 12–30 h (27Turnheim K. Krivanek P. Oberbauer R. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1999; 48: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, examination of the inhibitory properties of oxypurinol toward immobilized XO is of biological interest and clinical relevance. Substantially more oxypurinol was required to inhibit bound XO (Ki = 230 nm for free XO versus 405 nm for GAG-bound XO). Following the binding of XO to GAGs, it has been determined that immobilization, not diffusional limitations, alters the affinity of XO for xanthine at the molybdenum site (14Radi R. Rubbo H. Bush K. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because the reduction of XO at the molybdenum site is a prerequisite for oxypurinol binding, the higher Km of immobilized XO for the required reductant (xanthine) results in lower rates of inhibition for oxypurinol toward the bound enzyme and may also explain the slower rates of HS6B-XO reactivation. When tested in a cultured endothelial cell model, exogenously added XO binds to GAGs and displays significant resistance to inhibition by oxypurinol (Fig. 4). As with HS6B-XO, complete inhibition of cell-associated XO activity does not occur at clinically relevant oxypurinol concentrations (Table III). These similarities in cell-associated XO responses to oxypurinol affirm the usefulness of using HS6B-XO as a model for studying the kinetic parameters of this proinflammatory and pathogenic enzyme when associated with the vasculature. However, a modest proportion of cell-associated XO becomes internalized over time (9Houston M. Estevez A. Chumley P. Aslan M. Marklund S. Parks D.A. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4985-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); therefore, it is also possible that the inability of oxypurinol to achieve complete inhibition of cell-associated XO may be due to limited access of the inhibitor to this internalized protein as well as to alterations caused by GAG binding of XO to the cell surface. Future studies may be directed to evaluate the extent to which cell internalized XO accounts for limitations to oxypurinol inhibition of cell-associated XO. During diverse pathological states such as type I diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and heart failure, circulating XO levels are substantially elevated (6Hare J.M. Johnson R.J. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1951-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Leyva F. Anker S.D. Godsland I.F. Teixeira M. Hellewell P.G. Kox W.J. Poole-Wilson P.A. Coats A.J. Eur.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) (Table III). Negatively charged GAGs comprising the glycocalyx of vascular endothelial cells in turn may sequester circulating XO and significantly amplify its local concentration (28Hook M. Kjellen L. Johansson S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 847-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 29Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). This amplification occurs at an anatomical site critical for vascular cell ·NO- and redox-dependent signaling reactions that modulate vessel relaxation as well as vessel wall-inflammatory cell interactions and intimal cell proliferation. In conditions such as ischemia where ATP catabolism is increased, the concentrations of purine substrates are also elevated (Table III). This confluence of inactivation-resistant XO and increased levels of substrate in the vascular compartment sets the stage for enhanced formation of O2·¯ and H2O2. Such increases in rates of ROS production limit the bioavailability of ·NO as well as augment the formation of ·NO-derived species such as ONOO– that can potentiate oxidative inflammatory injury (8White C.R. Darley-Usmar V. Berrington W.R. McAdams M. Gore J.Z. Thompson J.A. Parks D.A. Tarpey M.M. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8745-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recent studies affirm such a role for XO in vascular disease by demonstrating increases in NO-dependent vasodilatation upon treatment with allopurinol (8White C.R. Darley-Usmar V. Berrington W.R. McAdams M. Gore J.Z. Thompson J.A. Parks D.A. Tarpey M.M. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8745-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 30Ellis A. Li C.G. Rand M.J.

Med. 1996; 211: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the aggregate, these data demonstrate that GAG association with XO results in an enzyme with an increased half-life that is resistant to oxidative inactivation. Importantly, these results begin to provide insight into the interactions of XO and XO-derived ROS with the vascular surface. Additionally, these observations reveal that in a biological milieu, XO inhibitors such as oxypurinol do not fully inhibit the production of XO-derived ROS or uric acid and indicate the need for development of alternative approaches to achieve inhibition of cell-associated XO.

https://openalex.org/W2141331874,"We investigated the effects of focused ultrasound (FUS) on specific molecular signaling and cellular response in three closely related human Tk6 lymphoblast cell lines that differed only in their p53 status. The applied ultrasound parameters fell between the physical dose range, which is safely used in medical diagnostics (peak pressure<0.1 MPa) and that used for high-energy FUS thermal ablation therapy (peak pressure>10 MPa). Based on cDNA microarrays and protein analysis, we found that FUS at the intermediate peak pressure of 1.5 MPa induced a complex signaling cascade with upregulation of proapoptotic genes [e.g., p53, p21, Thy1 (CD 90)]. Simultaneously, FUS downregulated cellular survival components (e.g., bcl-2, SOD). The p53 status was important for the reaction of the cells to ultrasound. Apoptosis and G1 arrest were induced primarily in p53+ cells, while p53- cells showed less apoptosis but exhibited G2 arrest. Likewise, the proliferation of lymphoblasts was much more strongly inhibited in p53+ than in p53- cells. Microarray analysis further demonstrated an upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress (e.g., ferritin), suggesting that indirect sonochemical effects via reactive oxygen species play a causative role in the interaction of ultrasound with lymphoblasts. An important characteristic of FUS in therapeutic ultrasound applications is its ability to be administered to the human body in a targeted manner while sparing intermediate tissues. Therefore, our data indicate that this noninvasive, mechanical wave transmission, which is free of ionizing radiation, has the potential to specifically induce localized cell signals and apoptosis."

Together, the structure and functional analysis provide insight into the structural framework necessary to perform the complex rearrangements catalyzed by this class of polyketide cyclases. Polyketides represent a diverse group of natural products produced by plants, fungi, and bacteria that have well established therapeutic and antibiotic properties (1O'Hagan D. The Polyketide Metabolites. Ellis Horwood, New York1991Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of polyketides resembles fatty acid synthesis, in which a series of small CoA precursors, such as acetate, propionate, or butyrate, are combined by the polyketide synthase enzyme(s) (2Staunton J. Weissman K.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 380-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 3Cane D.E. Walsh C.T. Khosla C. Science. 1998; 282: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Polyketide synthases are organized into two classes: type I polyketide synthases, which are giant multifunctional, multidomain proteins that contain multiple active sites on a single enzyme, and type II polyketide synthases, which are discrete multienzyme systems made up of largely monofunctional enzymes. Type I polyketide synthases contain motifs that resemble the acyl carrier protein (ACP), 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. β-ketoacyl:ACP synthase, and an ACP acyltransferase from the domains of animal fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, ketoreductase and dehydratase activities play an important role in modifying the polyketide intermediates. Type II polyketide synthases mostly generate aromatic ring-containing compounds from the combination of acetyl and malonyl-CoA (4Hopwood D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2465-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 5Hutchinson C.R. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Examination of gene clusters in Streptomyces and other bacterial species indicates that the bacterial set of biosynthetic enzymes includes a β-ketoacyl:ACP synthase, ACP, and ketoreductase to generate poly-β-ketone intermediates, which are subsequently condensed by a unique set of enzymes called cyclases or aromatases. These latter enzymes catalyze an intermolecular aldol condensation of the poly-β-ketone intermediate. Since the poly-β-ketone intermediates are highly unstable, much of the work done thus far has been on the terminal cyclases. Enzymes such as JadI from the jadomycin pathway and DnrD from the doxorubicin pathway catalyze the final aldol condensation reaction to form a fused aromatic ring. Tetracenomycin C is an antibiotic/antitumor aromatic polyketide produced by Streptomyces glaucescens (5Hutchinson C.R. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the enzymes TcmJKLM can synthesize a linear decaketide that can spontaneously condense into TcmF2 (Fig. 1) (6Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Bao W. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8132-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); however, aberrant side products are generated. The addition of TcmN to the other polyketide synthase components enhances the production of TcmF2. TcmF2 is converted to TcmF1 by the enzyme TcmI (Fig. 1) to form the final fused aromatic ring (8Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11149-11154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several additional steps catalyze the conversion of TcmF1 to the final product tetracenomycin C. The polyketide cyclase enzyme TcmI has been characterized, and initial enzymatic studies have been performed (8Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11149-11154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is a small enzyme with a molecular weight of 12,728, where gel filtration suggested that the enzyme functions as a trimer. The reaction has been shown to yield two products when the pH of the reaction is varied. At pH >8.0 the carboxylated form of TcmF1 is generated, whereas the decarboxylated form is most prevalent at a pH of 6.5 or lower. Additionally, there is a strong drop off of product formation at pH 6.5. This suggests that a catalytic residue, such as a histidine, may play a role in catalysis. In order to establish a molecular framework for understanding the reaction mechanism and specificity of this enzyme, a structural study coupled with site-directed mutagenesis was initiated. We report here the structure of tetracenomycin F2 cyclase (TcmI) from S. glaucescens to 1.9-Å resolution. This shows that the enzyme exhibits a fold that is similar to that found in other polyketide monooxygenases and provides insight into structural framework necessary to perform the complex rearrangements catalyzed by this class of polyketide cyclases. Although a structure with bound substrate could not be obtained, the close relationship of the structures of TcmI and the actva-orf6 monooxygenase (9Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G.

The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cloning and Expression of the Wild-type Protein—For protein expression of the wild type protein, the plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3). In general, a single colony was used to inoculate a 3-ml liquid culture of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After incubation at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 16 h, 0.6 ml of culture was transferred into a 2-liter baffled Erlenmeyer flask containing 600 ml of medium as described above. The culture was grown under the same conditions until the A600 was ∼1.0. Thereafter, 3 ml of this culture was used to inoculate a New Brunswick Scientific MPPF vessel (60-liter working volume). The pH and the dissolved oxygen were maintained at 7.0 and 20% of air saturation, respectively. Ampicillin was not added to the culture medium. The culture was grown at 37 °C until the A600 was ∼1.0, at which point the culture was induced by a batch addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (Amresco) (0.5 mm), and the culture growth was allowed to continue for 4 h. A yield of ∼5 g of wet cell paste was obtained per liter of culture medium. Selenomethionine-labeled TcmI was obtained by controlled fermentation (10Studts J.M. Fox B.G. Protein Expr.

A single colony from a LB agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was used to inoculate a 3-ml liquid culture of the same medium. When this culture reached A600 0.2, 0.2-ml aliquots were used to inoculate two 2-liter baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of a minimal medium (10Studts J.M. Fox B.G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 500-ml shaken flask cultures were grown to A600 ≈ 0.8 and were then used to inoculate a fermentor containing 10 liters of the same medium prepared without ampicillin. During the fermentation, the pH and the dissolved O2 were maintained at 7.0 and 20% of air saturation, respectively. The rate of O2 utilization was then closely monitored to detect when methionine was depleted, and when the culture reached A600 ≈ 5, the rate of O2 utilization dropped, indicating the onset of methionine depletion. At this time, 2.0 g of (±)-selenomethionine (ACROS) was added, and 2 min later the culture was induced by the addition of 4 g/liter of d-(+)-lactose. A yield of ∼8 g of wet cell paste was obtained per liter of culture medium. 60-70% of the recombinant TcmI and selenomethionine-labeled TcmI were in the insoluble form. This material could not be solubilized with detergent or refolded from urea or guanidine HCl. Overproduction of TcmI Mutant Proteins—The resultant plasmids were introduced via transformation into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Five ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml sodium ampicillin or 50 mg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with a single colony of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed and incubated overnight at 37 °C. One liter of the same medium with 100 μg/ml sodium ampicillin or 50 μg/ml kanamycin was seeded with the densely grown preculture and shaken at 150 rpm at 27 °C for 12 h. Then 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce expressions. After induction, incubation was contained for 12 h at 27 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 × g, and the cell pellet was stored at -80 °C. Purification of Wild-type TcmI and Selenomethionine-labeled TcmI—Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and sonicated with a Sonifer cell disruptor, model 185 (Branson). DNase I (Sigma) and MgCl2 were added to the lysate to final concentrations of 1 μg/ml and 10 mm, respectively, and the mixture was left to incubate on ice for 30 min. Clear lysate (13,680 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT and loaded on to Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with 10 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0-1.0 m). Fractions were analyzed by cyclase activity and SDS-PAGE. Fractions contained TcmI were brought to 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4 by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate, and pH was adjusted to 8.0 by the addition of NH4OH. The resultant solution was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose CL6B (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with 10 column volumes of a linear (NH4)2SO4 gradient (1.2 to 0 m). The fractions containing TcmI were concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml and buffer-exchanged with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT utilizing Centriprep YM-3 centrifugal units (Millipore). The protein was further purified on a MonoQ HR10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with five column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.6 m). Minor contaminants were removed thereafter by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Purified TcmI was then concentrated and buffer-exchanged with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT using Centriprep YM-3. The resultant protein was drop-frozen into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. The selenomethionine-labeled TcmI was purified in a similar manner to that of the native protein except that all buffers were freshly degassed by aspiration and that dithiothreitol was added to all purification buffers to a final concentration of 10 mm. Purification of TcmI Variants—The purification of the mutant proteins was performed in a similar manner to that of the wild type protein except that the thawed cells were gently resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10% (w/v) glycerol. The filtrate was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (160 ml; Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in degassed buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT) at 2 ml/min. The column was washed extensively with buffer A and then eluted with an NaCl gradient (0-1 m) in buffer A. The active fraction was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1.7 m NH4SO2), filtered, and absorbed on to a HiPrep 16/10 Butyl column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in degassed buffer B at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer B and then eluted with an NH4SO2 gradient (1.7 to 0 m) in buffer B. The protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography, concentrated, and stored at -80 °C as before. A typical 1-liter culture produced about 0.2 mg of purified enzyme. Kinetic Assays—Kinetic assays were carried out at 30 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by monitoring the consumption of TcmF2 and the formation of TcmF1 by HPLC. For determination of Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat (per active site) and Km, the series of substrate concentrations was as follows: 0.062, 0.081, 0.12, 0.24, and 5.0 mm or 0.31, 0.38, 0.50, 0.71, 1.3, and 5.0 mm. The assay solution was preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction then was initiated by the addition of TcmF2 and terminated after a 5- or 30-min incubation at 30 °C by the addition of solid NaH2PO4 (100 mg) to saturation and extraction with ethyl acetate (200 μl). The aliquot was directly injected into the HPLC system. The HPLC analytical conditions were as described previously (8Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11149-11154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

Large crystals were obtained by macroseeding with small crystals (0.06 × 0.08 mm) washed in macroseeding 1.4 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, to slightly dissolve the crystal surfaces. After 3-4 weeks, the crystals attained a size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.6 mm. Crystals of the selenomethionine-labeled protein were obtained in a similar manner. The crystals belong to the space group P6522 and have unit cell dimensions of a = b = 46.6 Å, c = 188.3 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120° with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Prior to x-ray data collection, crystals were transferred stepwise into a solution containing 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 20% ethylene glycol, 50 mm HEPES at pH 7.5. Multiple anomalous dispersion selenomethionine-labeled data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source on the 19-ID beam-line of the Structural Biology Center at Argonne National Laboratory on a single crystal at three wavelengths (Table I). Data were recorded with a 3-s exposure time and an oscillation angle of 1° at a crystal to detector distance of 235 mm.

Data were recorded at a crystal to detector distance of 22 cm with CuKα radiation generated by a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA and equipped with Göbel focusing mirrors. Data were collected with an oscillation angle of 0.15° for 45-60 s, integrated with XDS (13Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Structural Determination and Refinement—The structure of tetracenomycin F2 cyclase was solved to 2.4-Å resolution by multiwave-length anomalous dispersions methods. The atomic positions of the seleniums were determined with the program SOLVE (14Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and refined with the program CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The correct enantiomer for the space group was chosen by visual inspection of the resultant electron density maps. A model for the protein was built with TURBO-FRODO (16Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 86. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) and refined with the maximum likelihood refinement of CNS and the least squares refinement of TNT. The model derived from the Se-Met data (Rwork of 23.0% and Rfree of 28.4%) was transferred to the native data to complete the refinement. Iterative cycles of least squares refinement and manual model building with the programs TNT and Turbo (16Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 86.

The Rfree was 24.5% for 5% of the data that were excluded from the refinement. Least squares refinement statistics are presented in Table III.

The data utilized in the Rfree calculation were removed prior to least squares refinement Open table in a new tab The final model for the tetracenomycin F2 cyclase contains 106 of 109 amino acids. The electron density starts at Ala2 and extends continuously to Pro107, where the two remaining residues in the sequence could not be modeled. The protein assembles as a tight dimer, where each subunit exhibits a fold that belongs to the ferredoxin fold superfamily that is characterized by βαβ repeats in the SCOP data base (19Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5539) Google Scholar). This disagrees with the earlier prediction, based on gel filtration, that the enzyme might assemble as a trimer (8Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11149-11154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, this is not surprising because of the nonspherical shape of the dimer discussed below. The globular domain consists of two layers of secondary structural elements: an antiparallel β-sheet in one layer and three helices in the second (Fig. 3). The sheet exhibits the strand order 1, 3, 2, (4′), where the first and second strands are connected by the first helix, and the second and third are connected by a β-turn. The second and third helix follow the third β-strand and contribute to the second layer of secondary structural elements. Thereafter, the final 10 residues form an extended section of the polypeptide chain, starting at Ala98, that domain-swaps with the dimer-related subunit. This segment forms a fourth β-strand that increases the breadth of the antiparallel β-sheet. As such, the fold for tetracenomycin F2 cyclase belongs to the ferredoxin superfamily that is characterized by βαβ repeats. Overall, the β-sheet exhibits a pronounced curvature. Two subunits of TcmI assemble to form an elongated dimer with a compact with and extensive interface between subunits. The interface is created by the juxtaposition of the dimer related β-sheets, which creates a distorted antiparallel β-barrel that accommodates the pronounced curvature of the β-sheets (Fig. 4). A substantial fraction of the surface area of each subunit, 1951 Å2, is buried as determined with the program GETAREA (20Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The interface between the monomers is highly hydrophobic as indicated by the burial of 1459 Å2 of nonpolar surface area per subunit. A search with the DALI server reveals a strong topological similarity between TcmI and actva-orf6 monooxygenase from Streptomyces coelicolor (Protein Data Bank accession number 1LQ9, Z-score 7.0) (9Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with the next closest similarity to a subdomain of cholesterol oxidase from Brevibacterium sterolicum (Protein Data Bank accession number 1IL9, Z-score 4.5) (22Coulombe R. Yue K.Q. Ghisla S. Vrielink A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30435-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The relationship to cholesterol oxidase is purely topological, where the fold observed in TcmI occurs as a component of a domain that is dominated by an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. This will not be discussed further. In contrast to cholesterol oxidase, there does appear to be a structural and functional relationship with the monooxygenase, since this catalyzes the oxidation of 6-deoxydihydrokalafungin to dihydrokalafungin in the biosynthetic pathway for actinorhodin. Actinorhodin is also a polyketide antibiotic with a similar molecular framework to that seen in tetracenomycin C. In chemical terms, this latter enzyme catalyzes an earlier reaction to that performed by the tcmI gene product in the tetracenomycin C biosynthetic pathway. The fold for the actva-orf6 monooxygenase contains five antiparallel β-strands with strand order 4, 1, 3, 2, 5′, where the first three strands have the same topology as that now observed in tetracenomycin F2 cyclase. Furthermore, both enzymes exhibit the strand-swapping that serves to increase the width of the sheet adjacent to the second strand. The major difference between these folds is the inclusion of an additional antiparallel β-strand adjacent to the first strand in the fold for actva-orf6 monooxygenase. Even with this disparity, the root mean square difference between 85 structurally equivalent α-carbon atoms is only 2.2 Å (Fig. 5a). Comparison of the two structures reveals that although tetracenomycin F2 cyclase lacks the additional strand seen in actva-orf6 monooxygenase, there is an extended section of random coil that follows the end of the second α-helix and precedes the swapped strand. This plays a role in closing off the large cavity that lies between the α-helices and β-sheets that is presumed to constitute the active site. Because of the differences in the number of strands, the relative orientation of the β-sheets relative to the dimer 2-fold is different in the two enzymes. In tetracenomycin F2 cyclase, the presence of four antiparallel β-strands that form a curved sheet allows the two subunits to assemble so that the strands are inclined at an angle of ∼30° to the dimer axis to form a cylindrical barrel (Fig. 5). This orientation of sheets is analogous to that seen in parallel (β/α)8 barrels. The inclusion of an extra strand in the actva-orf6 monooxygenase would create a hollow barrel if the strands were arranged at an angle of ∼30° to the dimer axis. As a consequence, the sheets on opposing dimers are inclined approximately perpendicular to each other, which allows for a closely packed inter"

More than 8 million people per year are diagnosed with tuberculosis, and nearly 2 million of those people die (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). The continued rise in drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis and the scale of the tuberculosis epidemic has stimulated fundamental research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of anti-tuberculosis drugs, including INH, with a view that this information can initiate the discovery of new antimicrobial targets and alternative treatment regimes.Although INH has been in clinical use for the treatment of tuberculosis since the 1950s, the mechanism of activation of this prodrug and its mode of action are still not fully established. However, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that a catalase-peroxidase (CP), endogenous to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the principal causative agent of the disease), is required for activation of INH (discussed in Ref. 2Bertrand T.

Computational analyses of the mtCP structure identified an energetically favorable binding site for INH near the δ-meso edge of the heme (2Bertrand T. Eady N.A.J. Jones J.N. Jesmin Nagy J.M. Jamart-Gregoire B. Raven E.L. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38991-38999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This location is similar to that observed for other small aromatic compounds in the crystal structures of class I, II, and III peroxidases (13Sharp K.H. Moody P.C.E. Brown K.A. Raven E.L.

Welinder K.G. Smith A.T. Gajhede H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). An alternative binding site has also been suggested based upon crystallographic studies of the Burkholderia pseudomallei CP, which places INH in a surface loop structure (17Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) ∼10 Å away from the binding site of small aromatic compounds located near the δ-meso edge of the heme. The local environment of INH in this surface loop is considerably different from that near the δ-meso edge of the heme, and activation of the INH in this case is proposed to involve an electron transfer pathway that would be unique to CP enzymes (17Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Presently there is no reported structure of an INH-peroxidase complex, and it is clear that identification of an INH binding site is essential for defining key residues and other structural elements that catalyze the activation of the drug.Interestingly, it has been shown that the class III peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), can oxidize INH using hydrogen peroxide in a classic peroxidatic mechanism involving the formation of Compound I to produce reactive species capable of reducing nitro blue tetrazolium (18Shoeb Jr., H.A.B.U.B. Ottolenghi A.C. Merola A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Later work from the same group demonstrated similar activity using partially purified M. tuberculosis CP (6Shoeb H.A. Bowman Jr., B.U. Ottolenghi A.C. Merola A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that Compound II can be stably generated in the reaction of HRP Compound I with INH, further supporting the operation of a classic peroxidatic mechanism of INH oxidation for this enzyme (19Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The same authors also identified Compound I in the reaction of M. tuberculosis CP with INH and speculated that a similar peroxidatic pathway may be utilized (19Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Based upon these data and the amenability of HRP to characterization of enzyme-aromatic compound complexes using NMR methods (20Veitch N.C. Williams R.J.P. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we have, therefore, undertaken a high resolution NMR characterization of the interactions between horseradish peroxidase C (HRPC) and INH. This paper, therefore, presents models of the HRPC·INH complex in the presence and absence of cyanide. Using 15N-labeled INH, we demonstrate that HRPC activates INH via the splitting of a C-N bond as previously reported for mtCP (8Bodiguel J. Nagy J.M. Brown K.A. Jamart-Gregoire B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3832-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, we report data demonstrating that other class I enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), are also capable of turning over INH. Furthermore, the availability of an NMR-derived HRPC·INH complex enables us to generate docked complexes of INH in the active sites of the crystal structures of APX (29Sharp K.H. Mewies M. Moody P.C. Raven E.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and CcP (30Wang J.M. Mauro M. Edwards S.L. Oatley S.J. Fishel L.A. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7160-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) in the same manner as described for the mtCP·INH complex (2Bertrand T. Eady N.A.J. Jones J.N. Jesmin Nagy J.M.

Using these complexes potential enzyme-drug interactions found in the class I and class III peroxidases are described, and an enzyme-catalyzed mechanism for INH activation is proposed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Deuterium oxide, 3-nitrobenzoic acid and hydrogen peroxide (30% w/v) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. HRPC was also obtained from Sigma Aldrich and was used without any further purification. Protein concentration of HRPC was determined spectrophotometerically by measuring absorbance at 403 nm (ϵ403 = 102,000 m-1cm-1) (31Aibara S. Yamashita H. Mori E. Kata M. Morita Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). mtCP was prepared as described in Bertrand et al. (2Bertrand T. Eady N.A.J. Jones J.N. Jesmin Nagy J.M. Jamart-Gregoire B. Raven E.L. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38991-38999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recombinant soybean APX (rsAPX) and recombinant pea APX (rpAPX) were prepared as described previously (32Lad L. Mewies M. Raven E.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13774-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine HCl was from Fluka (Gillingham, UK) and was recrystallized in ethanol before use. KCN was from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy), and INH was obtained from Cairn Chemicals (Chesham, UK). Singly labeled isotopic isomers of INH were prepared as previously described (33Brosse N. Pinto M.F. Jamart-Gregoire B. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; : 3685-3688Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Jamart-Gregoire B. Brosse N. Bodiguel J. J. Synthesis. 1998; : 269-270Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were obtained from Merck.NMR Spectroscopy—Samples were prepared by exchanging HRPC into 50 mm NaH2PO4 buffer in either H2O (buffer A) or deuterium oxide (buffer B) using a Centricon-10 (Amicon, Danvers, MA) and then adjusting the pH to 7.0. The cyanide adduct was obtained by the addition of excess solid KCN followed by re-adjusting the pH to 7.0. Protein concentration of samples prepared in buffer A ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 mm, whereas the protein concentration of samples prepared in buffer B was 2.5 mm.One-dimensional 1H NMR and titration experiments were performed using a standard water-suppression sequence at 318 K using either a Bruker DRX 500 or a Bruker AVANCE 800 spectrometer. Spectra for HRPC in buffer A were collected at 500 MHz, whereas spectra for the HRPC-cyanide adduct in buffer B were collected at 800 MHz. Titration of INH into both samples was performed by the stepwise addition using 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, and 0.01 m stock solutions of INH (prepared in buffer A or B) until no further change in the spectra were observed (>250 mm).Two-dimensional NMR experiments including NOESY (35Macura S. Wuthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 351-357Google Scholar) and clean total correlation spectroscopy (36Bax A. Caldwell J.W. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) spectra were collected using a Bruker AVANCE 800 spectrometer at both 318 and 308 K. T1 values of the INH signals from solutions containing 20 mm INH in buffer B and concentrations of HRPC or the HRPC-cyanide adduct from 0 to 0.8 mm in buffer B were recorded at 800 MHz using the inversion recovery sequence (37Vold R.L. Waugh J.S. Klein M.P. Phelps D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1968; 48: 3831-3832Crossref Scopus (837) Google Scholar). All two-dimensional NMR experiments were phase-sensitive, recorded in the time proportional phase increment mode (38Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3516) Google Scholar) using standard pulse sequences. For NOESY experiments, spectral widths of 50,000 and 20,000 Hz were used with mixing times of 20 and 50 ms and recycle delays ranging from 300 to 500 ms. For scalar experiments only the smallest spectral width was used with a recycle delay of 500 ms. Spectra were acquired using 800-1024 free induction decays with 4096 complex data points. Data were processed using a sine-squared bell function shifted 45° or 30°. Data-matrices were 0-filled to give the final 4096 × 2048-processed maps.Data were analyzed using the XEASY program (ETH, Zurich, Switzerland) (39Eccles C. Guntert P. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) on an IBM RISC 6000. NOESY cross-peaks were integrated with the standard routines of the XEASY program and translated in proton-proton distances using cross-peaks between protons at fixed distances for calibration.Analysis of Relaxation Data—The observed longitudinal relaxation time of a nucleus belonging to a molecule exchanging between the bound and free state and concomitantly sensing the paramagnetic metal ion is, in the fast-exchange limit, the weighted average between the diamagnetic (T1 d) and paramagnetic (T1 M) rates according toT1 obs−1=fbT1 M−1+ffT1 d−1(Eq. 1) where fb is the molar fraction of nuclei bound to the paramagnetic molecule, and ff is the unbound molar fraction. For molecules with low affinity for the paramagnetic molecule, the former quantity can safely be approximated to unity. If the affinity constant for the adduct or complex is known, from the value of T1 M-1 it is possible to obtain a distance limit between the metal ion and the nucleus according to the Solomon-Bloembergen equation (40Solomon I. Phys. Rev. 1955; 99: 559-565Crossref Scopus (2774) Google Scholar, 41Bloembergen N. J. Chem. Phys. 1957; 27: 572-573Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar). For INH binding to HRPC, T1 obs of interest are those of the ring proton resonances of INH that can easily be measured at various concentrations of enzyme. Because the pyridinyl ring is symmetrical but does flip, INH C2H protons are defined as the ring carbons in the ortho position relative to pyridinyl nitrogen, whereas INH C3H protons are in the meta position (Fig. 1A). A reasonable estimate of the diamagnetic contribution T1 d can be obtained from the T1 values of the same resonances in the presence of the HRPC-cyanide adduct, provided that INH binds to this adduct in a manner similar to that which it binds HRPC. This assumption is reasonable because the iron in the HRPC-cyanide adduct is in a low spin state and, therefore, has much faster electronic relaxation rates compared with unliganded HRPC. It follows that nuclear relaxation rates for the cyanide adduct are much less affected by the paramagnetic center.Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Before molecular dynamics simulations, models of HRPC, the HRPC-cyanide adduct, HRPC·INH, and HRPC-cyanide-INH were constructed using the modeling program Sybyl (Tripos Associates, Inc.) on an Evans and Sutherland model PS390 graphics work station. The starting model for HRPC was the x-ray structure (42Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1ATJ). Residues reported in the x-ray structure were used in the modeling studies. Cyanide was docked on to the HRPC model by coordinating its carbon atom to the HRPC iron at an orientation essentially perpendicular to the heme plane based upon coordinates of the x-ray structure for the CcP-cyanide complex (43Edwards S.L. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2588-2595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The orientation of INH in HRPC·INH and HRPC-cyanide-INH models was obtained using distances derived from relaxation data and/or NOEs as described above. All models also contained the two calcium ions present in the HRPC crystal structure.Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on the four models listed above with the AMBER 4.1 software package (44Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER. 4.1 Ed. University of California, San Francisco1995Google Scholar) using an IBM/SP2 parallel computer. Throughout the calculations the SHAKE algorithm was used (45van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Mol. Physiol. 1977; 34: 1311-1327Crossref Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), and geometrical restraints were applied to maintain the four disulfide bridges in the HRPC crystal structure (Cys-11-Cys-91, Cys-44-Cys-49, Cys-97-Cys-301, and Cys-177-Cys-209). All force field parameters (except those for the heme, the proximal histidine residue, calcium ions, and cyanide) were taken from the AMBER 4.1 force field data base (46Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould Jr., I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11443) Google Scholar) optimized for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins with the inclusion of water molecules. Force field parameters for INH were derived from the parameters of its composite moieties also contained in the AMBER 4.1 force field data base (46Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould Jr., I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11443) Google Scholar). Atomic point charges for INH were kindly provided by Dr. Caterina Ghio (ICQEM-CNR, Pisa, Italy) and were obtained from GAUSSIAN 94 (47Fritsch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Gill P.M.W. Johnson B.G.

GAUSSIAN 94, Revision B.3 Ed. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburg, PA1995Google Scholar) using the 6-31G basis set with geometry optimization. Equilibrium bond lengths and angles for the heme and proximal histidine were taken from the crystallographic coordinates of the HRPC structure (42Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), and similar parameters for the cyanide ligand were used from previously published data (48Banci L. Bertini I. Bren K.L. Gray H.B. Sompornpisut P. Turano P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11385-11398Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Force constants for bond stretching and bending and torsional force constants used in the calculations for the heme, the proximal histidine residue, calcium ions, and cyanide were identical to those previously described (48Banci L. Bertini I. Bren K.L. Gray H.B. Sompornpisut P. Turano P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11385-11398Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 49Banci L. Carloni P. Savellini G.G.

Chem. 1996; 1: 264-272Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The overall charge of HRPC was neutralized by adding chloride counterions using the CION utility in AMBER 4.1. This was done by placing counterions near positively charged residues and avoiding the channel region near the heme. All four models were then solvated with a 10-Å shell of Monte Carlo T1P3P water molecules (51Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29154) Google Scholar) using the SOL-BLOB option in the EDIT module of AMBER 4.1. Counterions and solvent water molecules were equilibrated by minimizing the root mean square energy gradient to 0.10 kcal mol-1Å-1 followed by 5 ps of molecular dynamics calculations. Energy minimization of the entire system (for all four models) was then performed until a root mean square energy gradient of 0.10 kcal mol-1Å-1 was obtained. Energy-minimized models at 0 K were heated to 300 K by performing three molecular dynamics calculations of 3 ps each at 100, 200, and 300 K in that order. The coupling with the external bath was maintained using a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. Finally, a 121.5-ps trajectory was calculated for all models. Averaged structures, generated by the CARNAL module of AMBER 4.1, were obtained using the last 67.5 ps of the trajectory. These structures were then minimized to obtain representative models in solution.Computational Predictions of INH Binding Sites—GRID calculations (52Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar) were performed on atomic coordinate files of the crystal structures of APX (53Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and CcP (30Wang J.M. Mauro M. Edwards S.L. Oatley S.J. Fishel L.A. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Kraut J.

Superpositions were carried out using Swiss PDB Viewer (54Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9467) Google Scholar). Generation of the mtCP-INH model was done in a similar manner as described (2Bertrand T. Eady N.A.J. Jones J.N. Jesmin Nagy J.M. Jamart-Gregoire B. Raven E.L. Brown K.A. J. Biol.

Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 4 × 20 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with one colony from an L-agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin streaked from a glycerol stock of Escherichia coli BL21-CODONPLUS(DE3)-RIL[pT7CCPZf1] (56Darwish K. Li H.Y. Poulos T.L. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After overnight growth at 37 °C with shaking, each 20-ml culture was inoculated into 1 liter of 2× YT containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking until a cell density corresponding to an A600 of 0.8 was reached. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and growth was allowed to continue for a further 18 h at 33 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min. Cell pellets were routinely stored at -20 °C.Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. At this stage reconstitution with heme was performed according to the protocol previously described (2Bertrand T. Eady N.A.J. Jones J.N. Jesmin Nagy J.M. Jamart-Gregoire B. Raven E.L. Brown K.A. J.

Cells were lysed by sonication with 3 × 30-s bursts on power level 8 using a microtip and an XL2020 sonicator (Labcaire Systems, Clevedon, UK). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 9000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was treated with 100 μg/ml DNase and 10 μg/ml RNase for 1 h at 4 °C and then recentrifuged as before.A two-step purification protocol was followed using a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA with 0-1 m NaCl gradient) and an Amersham Biosciences Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column (50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl) as described for mtCP (2Bertrand T.

https://openalex.org/W2007602308,"The APS adapter protein plays a pivotal role in coupling the insulin receptor to CAP and c-Cbl in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent pathway of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a 3T3-L1 adipocyte library using APS as a bait identified a 418-amino acid ankyrin and SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) box protein Asb6 as an interactor. Asb6 is an orphan member of a larger family of Asb proteins that are ubiquitously expressed. However, Asb6 expression appears to be restricted to adipose tissue. Asb6 was specifically expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a 50-kDa protein but not in fibroblasts. In Chinese hamster ovary-insulin receptor (CHO-IR) cells Myc epitope-tagged APS interacted constitutively with FLAG-tagged Asb6 in the presence or absence of insulin stimulation and insulin stimulation did not alter the interaction. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin receptor activation was accompanied by the APS-dependent recruitment of Asb6. Asb6 did not appear to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy studies revealed that Asb6 colocalized with APS in CHO cells and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In immunoprecipitation studies in CHO cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the Elongin BC complex was found to be bound to Asb6, and activation of the insulin receptor was required to facilitate Asb6 recruitment along with Elongins B/C. Prolonged insulin stimulation resulted in the degradation of APS when Asb6 was co-expressed but not in the absence of Asb6. We conclude that Asb6 functions to regulate components of the insulin signaling pathway in adipocytes by facilitating degradation by the APS-dependent recruitment of Asb6 and Elongins BC."
https://openalex.org/W1988750522,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of tyrosines in its C terminus and in other cellular targets upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Here, by using peptides derived from EGFR autophosphorylation sites and cellular substrates, we tested the hypothesis that ligand may function to regulate EGFR kinase specificity by modulating the binding affinity of peptide sequences to the active site. Measurement of the steady-state kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, revealed that EGF did not affect the binding of EGFR peptides but increased the binding affinity for peptides corresponding to the major EGFR-mediated phosphorylation sites of the adaptor proteins Gab1 (Tyr-627) and Shc (Tyr-317), and for peptides containing the previously identified optimal EGFR kinase substrate sequence EEEEYFELV (3–7-fold). Conversely, EGF stimulation increased kcat ∼5-fold for all peptides. Thus, ligand changed the relative preference of the EGFR kinase for substrates as evidenced by EGF increases of ∼5-fold in the specificity constants (kcat/Km) for EGFR peptides, whereas ∼15–40-fold increases were observed for other peptides, such as Gab1 Tyr-627. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EGF (i) increased the binding affinity of EGFR to Gab1 Tyr-627 and Shc Tyr-317 sites in purified GST fusion proteins ∼4–6-fold, and (ii) EGF significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of these sites, relative to EGFR autophosphorylation, in cell lysates containing the full-length Gab1 and Shc proteins. Analysis of peptides containing amino acid substitutions indicated that residues C-terminal to the target tyrosine were critical for EGF-stimulated increases in substrate binding and regulation of kinase specificity. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration that ligand can alter specificity of a receptor kinase toward physiologically relevant targets. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of tyrosines in its C terminus and in other cellular targets upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Here, by using peptides derived from EGFR autophosphorylation sites and cellular substrates, we tested the hypothesis that ligand may function to regulate EGFR kinase specificity by modulating the binding affinity of peptide sequences to the active site. Measurement of the steady-state kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, revealed that EGF did not affect the binding of EGFR peptides but increased the binding affinity for peptides corresponding to the major EGFR-mediated phosphorylation sites of the adaptor proteins Gab1 (Tyr-627) and Shc (Tyr-317), and for peptides containing the previously identified optimal EGFR kinase substrate sequence EEEEYFELV (3–7-fold).

To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration that ligand can alter specificity of a receptor kinase toward physiologically relevant targets. Protein-tyrosine kinases, which catalyze the transfer of γ-phosphate from ATP to tyrosine side chains of peptide and protein substrates, play a central role in cellular signaling.

Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, and HER1) is the prototypical member of the ErbB family RTKs, which also includes ErbB2 (HER2, neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). Binding of growth factors that are structurally related to EGF induces a process of the receptor dimerization, kinase activation and autophosphorylation (2Schlessinger J.

A feature common to many protein kinases is the presence of one or more tyrosines in a segment referred to as the activation loop (A-loop). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines has been shown to be essential for stimulation of catalytic activity and biological functions for a number of RTKs, such as insulin receptor kinase (IRK) (10Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factor receptor (11Mohammadi M. Dikic I.

Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4473-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the extracellular domain (ECD) leads to dimerization of monomeric receptors or a rearrangement within the oligomeric receptors resulting in A-loop phosphorylation. In these instances, the unphosphorylated A-loop interacts with the kinase active site blocking the binding of ATP and/or peptide (13Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 14Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated A-loop adopts an open and extended conformation allowing substrate binding and catalysis. However, substitution of the conserved tyrosine (Tyr-845) in the A-loop of EGFR with phenylalanine has no demonstrable effect on the biological function of the receptor (15Gotoh N. Tojo A. Hino M. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A recent crystallographic investigation revealed that the overall structure of the EGFR kinase domain, including conformation of the activation loop, catalytic residues, relative orientation of the αC helix, and the conserved salt bridge (between Lys-721 and Glu-738), is similar to those of the phosphorylated active IRK (16Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). This suggests that the ligand-induced structural basis for EGFR kinase activation is different relative to other RTKs. Protein kinase specificity is believed to be critical for selective cellular signaling. The use of synthetic peptides in detailed studies investigating protein kinase specificity and catalysis is widely recognized and supported by crystallographic observations that peptide bound to the active site appears to exist in an extended conformation (17Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 18Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). By using a degenerate peptide library, it has been shown previously (19Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) that each tyrosine kinase has its own optimal peptide substrate, demonstrating that specificity is predominantly based on the residues immediately surrounding the phosphoacceptor tyrosine. In this work the identified optimal peptide for EGFR kinase was EEEEYFELV, with the tyrosine designated as the zero position and adjacent N- or C-terminal residues designated by minus or plus numbers relative to this tyrosine, respectively. Other peptide model studies (20Kemp B.E. Parker M.W. Hu S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Casnellie J.E.

Biochem. 1985; 54: 897-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the importance of acidic residues at these positions consistent with the identification of phosphorylation sites in tyrosine kinase protein substrates. By using peptides derived from EGFR, previous steady-state kinetic studies of EGFR kinase demonstrated that EGF increased Vmax values but did not significantly change peptide binding affinity (24Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14538-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Honegger A. Dull T.J. Szapary D. Komoriya A. Kris R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we have tested the hypothesis that binding of ligand to a receptor kinase may not only activate the kinase by increasing kcat but may also alter the binding affinity of select substrate primary sequences to the enzyme-active site. We have performed a systematic study using affinity-purified, epitope-tagged full-length EGFR and synthetic peptides corresponding to physiologically relevant phosphorylation sites. Our results revealed that EGF altered the relative preference of the EGFR kinase for substrates as evidenced by EGF-induced increases of ∼5-fold in the specificity constant for peptides derived from EGFR, whereas ∼15–40-fold increases were observed for other peptides, such as those derived from the cellular substrates Gab1 (containing Tyr-627) and Shc (Tyr-317). This differential fold increase in specificity constant for substrates was attributable to the fact that EGF lowered the Km and thus increased the binding affinity for these select peptide sequences. Consistent with the results obtained using peptides, we demonstrate that the Km values of EGFR kinase for Gab1 Tyr-627 and Shc Tyr-317 sites in glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein substrates were decreased ∼4–6-fold by EGF. Finally, we carried out a competition study between EGFR autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of these sites in Gab1 and Shc using cell lysates and confirmed that EGF stimulation increases the preference of EGFR kinase for these exogenous cellular substrate sites, relative to EGFR autophosphorylation sites. We believe this to be the first demonstration that ligand can alter specificity of a receptor kinase toward physiologically relevant target substrates. Antibodies and cDNAs—To generate the epitope-tagged EGFR, PCR amplification of a template containing EGFR cDNA in pcDNA 3.1/Mychis (Invitrogen) was performed by using 5′-tgtaccatcgatgtctacatga-3′ and 5′-cccaagctttgctccaataaattcactgctttgt-3′ primers. PCR product was digested with ClaI and HindIII and inserted into the template construct. Wild type, Y627F Gab1, and Shc expression plasmids were generously provided by Toshio Hirano (Osaka University) (26Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K.

GST fusion protein constructs were generated by PCR amplification by using primers containing 5′ EcoRI and 3′ NotI sites and subcloned into pGEX-6p1. Point mutations were produced by using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene), and the identity of cDNAs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Monoclonal antibodies against MAPK, phosphotyrosine (PY20), and Shc were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and monoclonal antibodies against EGFR and Myc were obtained from Neomarkers. Polyclonal phospho-Shc (Tyr(P)-317) and phospho-Gab1 (Tyr(P)-627) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Antibodies for phospho-MAPK and Gab1 were obtained from New England Biolabs and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. Preparation of Peptides—Synthetic peptides were prepared by solidphase synthesis using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 432A peptide synthesizer and purified using preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The identity and purity of peptides were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analytical reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Generation of Stable 32D Cell Lines—32D cells (28Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) were transfected with 20 μg of DNA by electroporation (960 microfarads, 0.25 kV) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II, cultured in 600 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks, and cloned by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Briefly, cells were incubated with anti-EGFR antibody (Ab-1, Neomarkers), stained with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody, and sorted by using a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage SE into 96-well plate, 1 cell per well. Clones were characterized by Western blotting using anti-EGFR and Myc antibodies. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with 0.3 μg/ml of primary antibody, and detection was performed using the Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) and enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to film. Purification of EGFR—Cells were grown in 2-liter stirring flasks to a density of ∼1.5 × 106 cells/ml, harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm, and pellets were extracted for 20 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm imidazole). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 40 min, the supernatant was incubated with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) at 4 °C for 1 h. EGFR was eluted with lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. EGFR concentration was measured by silver staining and Western blotting of SDS-PAGE gels using BSA and myc-GST-Grb2 as standards, respectively. Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Transformed BL 21 rosetta bacteria were grown to an A600nm of 0.7–0.8 at 37 °C and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were centrifuged and lysed using a French press in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with glutathione-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with the lysis buffer, the bound GST fusion proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluates were dialyzed against kinase reaction buffer without ATP. The concentrations of the fusion proteins were measured by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels using BSA as a standard. Tyrosine Kinase Assay—All kinase reactions were performed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 40 μg/ml BSA, 25 μm ATP with 62.5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and 9 nm EGFR in a total volume of 40 μl at 25 °C. EGFR was preincubated with or without 1 μm EGF for 10 min at 25 °C. Reactions were initiated by addition of peptide and were stopped with 8.5% H3PO4. Terminated reaction mixtures were transferred to P30 Filtermats (Wallac) and washed three times with 0.85% H3PO4 and three times with water, and bound radioactivity was quantified with a Trilux Macrobeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Initial rates were determined from the linear portion of the reaction (<5% substrate converted). Four replicates were measured in all experiments, and kinetic parameters were calculated using the Enzyme Kinetic Module of Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). For GST fusion protein phosphorylation by EGFR, the reactions were stopped with 4× SDS sample buffer and separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated proteins were detected by antibodies against phospho-Gab1 (Tyr(P)-627) or phospho-Shc (Tyr(P)-317), and chemiluminescence was quantified using a Kodak Image Station 440. Phosphorylation of Gab1 and Shc in Cell Lysates—Subconfluent COS-7 cells (15-cm dishes) were transfected with 10 μg of Gab1 or Shc cDNAs using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine technique (29Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and serum-starved overnight, and lysates were generated as described previously (30Deb T.B. Su L. Wong L. Bonvini E. Wells A. David M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15554-15560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of transfected cDNAs was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (30Deb T.B. Su L. Wong L. Bonvini E. Wells A. David M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15554-15560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To phosphorylate Gab1 or Shc, the cell lysates were mixed with purified EGFR, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of kinase reaction buffer containing ATP. The reactions were terminated by addition of 4× SDS sample buffer and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Autophosphorylation of EGFRs was detected by Western blotting using phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), whereas phosphorylation of Gab1 and Shc sites were detected by antibodies against phospho-Gab1 Tyr-627 and phospho-Shc Tyr-317, respectively. Expression and Purification of Epitope-tagged EGFR—To facilitate studies of EGFR tyrosine kinase, we generated stable 32D cell lines expressing either wild type (WT) or kinase-inactive (K721M) epitope-tagged versions of the human EGFR. 32D cells are excellent for this purpose because they grow rapidly in suspension and do not express any endogenous ErbBs (30Deb T.B.

A cDNA encoding the 1186-amino acid residue full-length EGFR with a 25-amino acid sequence containing a Myc and hexahistidine epitope sequence at the C terminus was generated. Transient transfection experiments comparing EGF-induced signaling in intact cells did not reveal any demonstrable difference between the EGFRs expressed from parental and tagged WT cDNAs (data not shown). 32D cells that express either WT or K721M EGFR were produced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blotting analysis of crude lysates relative to a Myc-tagged protein standard indicated that WT and K721M clones each expressed ∼1.5 × 106 EGFRs/cell. As expected, exposure of WT cells to EGF led to phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; extracellular-signal regulated kinase), whereas no MAPK phosphorylation was observed in K721M cells (Fig. 1A). WT and K721M EGFRs purified by Co2+-based immobilized metal affinity chromatography yielded ∼50 μg of EGFR/liter of culture as estimated by silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (data not shown). The synthetic 20-mer peptides used in the present study were derived from potential in vivo substrates, containing sequences identical to 17 amino acids surrounding the phosphoacceptor tyrosine, and were named by origin plus tyrosine position. The peptides also contained two and one lysine residues at the N and C termini, respectively, allowing them to bind strongly to phosphocellulose filters upon acidification (21Casnellie J.E. Harrison M.L. Pike L.J. Hellstrom K.E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Using EGFR Tyr-1173, which contained a documented major autophosphorylation site from the C terminus of the EGFR (32Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) as substrate, WT possessed an activity of 2.8 μm/min/μm EGFR in the absence of EGF, whereas K721M had no significant detectable activity (Fig. 1B). EGF stimulated the receptor kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner, and a maximal stimulation was reached at an [EGF]/[EGFR] ratio of ∼1 (Fig. 1B). The development of this assay provided a basis for the quantitative assessment of the catalytic efficiency of the EGFR toward peptide substrates and EGF regulation of this catalysis. EGF Does Not Affect the Relative Binding Affinities toward EGFR Peptides but Consistently Increases the Catalytic Rate Constants ∼5-Fold—EGFR possesses three major and two minor tyrosine autophosphorylation sites located at Tyr-1068, Tyr-1148, Tyr-1173 (24Downward J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and peptides were prepared representing these EGFR tyrosines. In addition, a peptide corresponding to Tyr-1114 in the C-terminal tail was generated because of the presence of acidic residue at –1 position (Table I). Steady-state enzyme kinetic studies provide measurements of relative substrate binding affinities (Km) and the catalytic rate constant (kcat). Fig. 2A contains representative Lineweaver-Burk plots of EGFR Tyr-1173 phosphorylation by EGFR at a fixed ATP concentration of 25 μm in the absence or presence of EGF. The linearity of the plots confirmed that Michaelis-Menten kinetics was obeyed under either condition. The double-reciprocal plots in the absence or presence of EGF intersected at the abscissa indicating that ligand did not affect the Km value for the peptide. However, EGF increased the kcat value ∼5.6-fold as evidenced by distinct intersections of the plots with ordinate. As summarized in Table I, the Km values for the different peptides ranged from 181 to 665 μm, whereas kcat values varied from 1.8 to 3.3 min–1 in the absence of EGF. EGF stimulation yielded little or no changes in Km values but resulted in 4.0–5.6-fold increases in kcat values. The specificity constant of an enzyme, kcat/Km, is the best measure for comparison of catalytic efficiencies toward different substrates. EGF activation resulted in an ∼5-fold increase in kcat/Km values for all EGFR peptides, which was mainly contributed by kcat. The EGFR peptides exhibited specificity constants ≥50 min–1 mm–1 in the presence of EGF with the exception of the Tyr-1086 autophosphorylation site peptide (∼12 min–1 mm–1). Similar to the three major EGFR autophosphorylation sites and many tyrosine kinase substrates (23Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 897-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tyr-1114 of EGFR is preceded by an acidic residue and possessed a relatively high specificity constant of ∼50 min–1 mm–1. However, Tyr-1114 has not been found to be phosphorylated in either in vitro reactions or in EGFR from EGF-treated cells (33Margolis B.L. Lax I. Kris R. Dombalagian M. Honegger A.M. Howk R. Givol D.

The structural motif of collagen is the triple helix formed by the repeated sequence of -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-. Previous reports showed that H-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10-OH (where ‘4(R)Hyp’ is (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline) forms a trimeric structure, whereas H-(4(R)Hyp-Pro-Gly)10-OH does not form a triple helix. Compared with H-(Pro-Pro-Gly)10-OH, the melting temperature of H-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10-OH is higher, suggesting that 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa position has a stabilizing effect. The inability of triple helix formation of H-(4(R)Hyp-Pro-Gly)10-OH has been explained by a stereoelectronic effect, but the details are unknown. In this study, we synthesized a peptide that contains 4(R)Hyp in both the Xaa and the Yaa positions, that is, Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 and compared it to Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, and Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2. Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 showed a polyproline II-like circular dichroic spectrum in water.

The higher transition temperature of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, can be explained by the higher trans/cis ratio of the Gly-4(R)Hyp peptide bonds than that of the Gly-Pro bonds, and this ratio compensates for the weaker interchain hydrogen bonds.

The collagen triple helix is one of the most abundant protein motifs in animals. Each of the three polypeptide chains forms a polyproline-II like structure, and these structures twist around each other to form a right-handed superhelix (1Jenkins C.L. Raines R.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Brodsky B. Shah N.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To form this structure, a sequence with Gly in every third position is required. The general sequence is -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-, and the Xaa and Yaa positions contain a high content of proline and hydroxyproline. Twenty-seven types of collagens and more than fifteen proteins that form a triple helix, but are not named collagens such as collectins, ficolins, and scavenger receptors (3Pace J.M. Kuslich C.D.

In vertebrates, most of the proline residues in the Yaa position of the -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-repeated sequence are post-translationally modified to 4(R)Hyp 1The abbreviations used are: 4(R)Hyp, (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline; 4(S)Hyp, (2S,4S)-4-hydroxyproline; 3(S)Hyp, (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline; 4(R)Flp, (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline; 4(S)Flp, (2S,4S)-4-fluoroproline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluoroenyl)methoxycarbonyl; NOESY, two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; CD, circular dichroism. 1The abbreviations used are: 4(R)Hyp, (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline; 4(S)Hyp, (2S,4S)-4-hydroxyproline; 3(S)Hyp, (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline; 4(R)Flp, (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline; 4(S)Flp, (2S,4S)-4-fluoroproline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluoroenyl)methoxycarbonyl; NOESY, two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; CD, circular dichroism. by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) (6Myllyharju J.

In invertebrates, collagens also play a crucial role. For example, Caenorhabditis elegans has more than 150 genes for collagenous proteins, mostly for cuticle collagens (8McMahon L. Muriel J.M. Roberts B. Quinn M. Johnstone I.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1366-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Annelid cuticle collagen has 4(R)Hyp residues in the Xaa position and galactosylated threonine residues in the Yaa position of the repeated -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-sequences, which are not found in vertebrates (9Gaill F. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutations in individual cuticle collagen genes can cause exoskeletal defects that alter the shape of the animal. In general, the content of 4(R)Hyp is related to the melting temperature (Tm) of collagens (10Burjanadze T.V. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 347-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), and the Tm of dispersed collagen molecules in solution is a few degrees lower than the body temperature of the species from which the collagen was derived (12Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). For the structural analysis of the collagen helix, synthetic peptides with -Gly-Xaa-Yaa-repeated sequences have been used since the 1960s (reviewed in Refs. 13Fields G.B. Prockop D.J.

The existence of 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position does not always prevent the formation of a triple helix. Recently, we have shown that, when the Yaa position is not Pro, Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Yaa)10-NH2 peptides form a triple helix (22Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32373-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In particular, Thr and Val in the Yaa position form a triple helix in water, and Thr, Val, allo-Thr, Ala, and Ser in the Yaa position form a triple helix in 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol (23Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32373-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The knowledge of the structural basis of triple helix stabilization by proline and hydroxyproline residues has significantly improved recently. The pyrrolidine ring structure, including puckering, the peptide dihedral angles of φ, ψ, and ω, and the propensity of trans conformation of X-Pro (X-4(R)Hyp) bonds play crucial roles in the stability. Raines and his colleagues (1Jenkins C.L. Raines R.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 24Holmgren S.K. Taylor K.M. Bretscher L.E. Raines R.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 666-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) pointed out the importance of the inductive and stereoelectronic effects of the hydroxyl group of 4(R)Hyp. The importance of the pyrrolidine ring puckering of imino acids was shown with quantum and molecular mechanical analysis (25Improta R. Mele F. Crescenzi O. Benzi C. Barone V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7857-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Improta R. Benzi C. Barone V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 12568-12577Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and was supported by the “propensity-based” stabilization of proline in the Xaa position and 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa position and the destabilization of 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position (27Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mastrangelo A. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of high resolution structures of triple helical peptides have been reported (29Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 30Berisio R. Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A.

Polymer J. 2001; 33: 812-818Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that the conformation of proline in the Xaa position is Cγ-endo (puckering down), and the proline (or 4(R)-hydroxyproline) in the Yaa position is Cγ-exo (puckering up). In the crystals, each polypeptide forms a left-handed helix with 7/1 screw symmetry. Three peptides form a right-handed helix with 7/2 symmetry, when the Xaa and the Yaa are imino acids, or more loose 10/3-like helix symmetry in the imino acid-poor regions (35Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The puckering of imino acids in H-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10-OH was also measured by two-dimensional NMR in D2O at 10 °C. The Xaa position Pro is Cγ-endo (puckering down), and the Pro (Hyp) in the Yaa position is Cγ-exo (puckering up) (36Li M.H. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7377-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Brodsky and her colleagues (37Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 893-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) pointed out the importance of water molecules that interact with the hydroxyl group of 4(R)Hyp. The contribution of bound water to the stability of the collagen triple helix is controversial (38Engel J. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There are 36 bound water molecules per asymmetric unit (21 residues) in H-(Pro-Pro-Gly)10-OH (27Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Three water molecules per tripeptide unit may interact with the peptide chain directly. One interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly, the other two are bound to the carbonyl oxygen of Pro in the Yaa position. There are two sharp peaks in the distribution of bound water molecules, one is at a distance of 2.7 Å from the nearest peptide atom, and the other is at 3.6 Å (39Berisio R. Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The number of bound water molecules is similar in H-(Pro-Pro-Gly)9-OH (34Hongo C. Nagarajan V. Noguchi K. Kamitori S. Okuyama K. Tanaka Y. Nishino N. Polymer J. 2001; 33: 812-818Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the analysis of the peptide containing -Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp-revealed 49 bound water molecules (40Kramer R.Z. Venugopal M.G. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1191-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, these bound water molecules found in crystal structures exchange very rapidly with bulk solvent when these peptides are studied in solution by NMR (41Melacini G. Bonvin A.M. Goodman M. Boelens R. Kaptein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and their role in the stabilization is unclear. Given the preceding knowledge of the stability of the collagen triple helix, the expectation is that the peptide Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 should form a triple helix with a stability between that of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2, which does not form a triple helix, and Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, which forms a very stable triple helix. We therefore compared the following series of homologous peptides Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, Ac-(Gly-Pro-Pro)10-NH2, and Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2. To our surprise, the results indicated that Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 has a higher transition temperature than Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized with an ABI 433A synthesizer. Couplings were carried out on a PAL-PEG-PS resin (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, 0.16 mmol/g) using Fmoc amino acids (Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, and Fmoc-4(R)Hyp(tBu)-OH) and acetyl glycine (Bachem). O-(7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1.1.3.3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, 4.0 eq)/diisopropylethylamine was used to mediate peptide couplings. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (Vydac® C18, 5 μm, 300E, 250 × 10 mm, W.R. Grace, Columbia, MD). All synthesized peptides were characterized by electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Micromass, Q-tof micro, Manchester, UK) and amino acid analysis. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter using a Peltier thermostatted cell holder and a 1-mm path length rectangular cell (Starna Cells Inc., Atascadero, CA). Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The wavelength spectra represent at least an average of 10 scans with 0.1-nm resolution. The CD data were analyzed with SCIENTIST for Windows (MicroMath Research, St. Louis, MO) using the cubic equation for the all-or-none model described in Frank et al. (42Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed in a Beckman Model E analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with a scanner. 12-mm Epon double-sector cells in an An-F Ti rotor were used. The peptides were analyzed in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl. The peptide concentrations were adjusted to 0.2-1.2 mg/ml. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were carried out at 4-6 °C with rotor speeds of 36,000-40,000 rpm. Molecular masses were evaluated from ln A versus r2 plots, where A represents the absorbance and r is the distance from the center of rotation. A partial specific volume of 0.71 ml/g was used for all calculations. The data were analyzed using a least square method with the SCIENTIST for Windows software (MicroMath Research). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.14 MHz. The 90° pulse width was 9 μs, and a low power 2-s presaturation pulse was applied to suppress the H2O resonance. The spectra were recorded as 16,384 points for the one-dimensional spectra and as 1,024 × 512 data point sets for the two-dimensional spectra. The NOESY data were collected with time-proportional phase incrementation in the indirect dimension, at mixing times between 30 and 120 ms, and a total recording time of about 10 h. Total correlation spectroscopy data were collected with various mixing times, ranging from 30 to 90 ms. The data were processed with Swan-MR or nmrPipe to 1024 × 1024 real data sets after application of a 60° phase-shifted sin2 function and Fourier transformation for the two-dimensional spectra; baselines were straightened with polynomials as needed. Spectra were referenced to 0 ppm via internal 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonate or via the water resonance (4.71 ppm at 30 °C). Final visualization and analyses of the two-dimensional data sets were performed using NMRView (43Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol.

The H/D exchange experiment was performed by recording a series of one-dimensional spectra after dissolving the peptides into D2O, buffered to pD 4.7 (uncorrected) with 100 mm acetate/acetic acid-d4. The peak intensities were evaluated by measuring the heights on the same absolute scale. This was found to give essentially the same results as when using the peak integrals. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The temperature dependence of the partial heat capacity was measured in an N-DSC II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Science Corp.). The heating rate was 7.5 °C/h, and the data were collected using the software provided by the manufacturer. The data were analyzed using the cubic equation for the all-or-none model described in Frank et al. (42Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A.

The CD spectra of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 in water at 4 °C are shown in Fig. 1A together with the spectra of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2, and Ac-(Gly-Pro-Pro)10-NH2 measured under the same conditions. The spectrum of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 shows a positive maximum at 225 nm and a negative minimum at 197 nm. In this regard, it most closely resembles the spectrum of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, but both extrema are smaller than those of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. The spectrum of Ac-(Gly-Pro-Pro)10-NH2 is slightly red-shifted when compared with the first two spectra. The spectrum of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2 is significantly different with a positive maximum at 222 nm and a negative minimum at 200 nm. At 95 °C the positive maximum disappears in all peptides except for Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, which still shows a positive maximum at 225 nm. The negative minimum is at 203 nm for all peptides (Fig. 1B). The persistence of the positive maximum at 225 nm with increasing temperature is shown in Fig. 1C, which also indicates the shift of the negative minimum from 197 to 203 nm. The change in ellipticity at 225 nm as a function of temperature shows that all peptides with the exception of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2 show a cooperative transition (Fig. 2). The midpoint of the transition (Tm) of the heating scan of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is at 74 °C, the Tm of the much broader transition of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is near 80 °C, and the Tm of Ac-(Gly-Pro-Pro)10-NH2 is at 47 °C. The folding and unfolding transitions of collagens and collagen-like peptides are slow, and a significant hysteresis is observed with fast scanning rates and low peptide concentrations (44Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 45Engel J. Bächinger H.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the evaluation of thermodynamic data, equilibrium transition curves were required. Fig. 3A shows the temperature dependence of the heat capacity for Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 measured at a 2 mm peptide concentration and with a heating/cooling rate of 7.5 °C/h. When a high concentration and a slow heating/cooling rate were used, the unfolding/refolding curves were practically identical. The hysteresis observed at lower concentrations, even present in peptides with cross-links (46Boudko S.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), disappeared under these conditions. Fig. 3B shows the CD transition curves measured at 235 nm under the same conditions. This wavelength was chosen because at 225 nm the CD signal fell outside the dynamic range of the instrument at this high concentration. The thermodynamic values of these transitions for the concentration-dependent all-or-none model (47Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) are given in Table I together with the values determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The van't Hoff enthalpy and entropy changes as well as the calorimetric enthalpy change were significantly smaller for Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 (ΔHcal = -6.2 kJ/mole of tripeptide unit) than the calorimetric enthalpy change for Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 (ΔHcal = -12.0 kJ/mole of tripeptide unit). The enthalpy change of -12.0 kJ/mole for Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is similar to the values of -13.4 and -13.9 kJ/mole obtained for H-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10-OH (47Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J.

Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, Ac-(Gly-Pro-Pro)10-NH2, and Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 are trimeric triple helical molecules, whereas Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2 is monomeric.Table IIMolecular mass determination by sedimentation equilibrium experimentsPeptideExperimental massTheoretical monomer massTheoretical trimer massDaAc-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH28300 ± 5002731.98195.7Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH28979 ± 5002891.98675.7Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH22932 ± 7002731.98195.7Ac-(Gly-Pro-Pro)10-NH27256 ± 5002571.97715.7 Open table in a new tab Two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were obtained for Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 in D2O solution (Fig. 4). Both data sets showed cross-peaks between nearly all proton resonance positions, clearly demonstrating that the peptides are triple helical at 30 °C (49Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 282-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 50Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. Peyton D.H.

Thus the CD, calorimetric, and analytical ultracentrifugation data about these peptides are confirmed. A comparison between of the two data sets suggested that there might be additional broadening in the NOESY spectrum of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. This stronger broadening might arise from less mobility of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 when compared with Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. We therefore performed an H/D exchange experiment to test for potential unfolding of the helix by examining the rate of the Gly NH exchange (Fig. 5). The results of this H/D exchange experiment show that at least two different Gly NH populations exist: a minor one with a faster decay, and a slower, dominant one. Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 retains a smaller fraction of the minor population at the initial time measured (1 min after mixing), and faster exchange of both populations (Table III). Thus, the H/D exchange data indicate that Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 has less overall structural integrity, insofar as H/D exchange would indicate.Table IIIH/D exchange data for Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2PeptideFractional amplitudeks−1Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH20.803.7 × 10−40.204.4 × 10−3Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH20.857.1 × 10−40.153.5 × 10−2 Open table in a new tab The results show that the peptide Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 forms a more stable triple helix than the peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, when evaluated by the Tm value. The steric restrictions imposed by the proline ring play a dominant role in the stability of the triple helix. The interchain hydrogen bonds between GlyNH... OC(Xaa) of an adjacent chain are also recognized as important for the stability. The additional stabilization observed by the hydroxylation of proline residues in the Yaa position to 4(R)-hydroxyproline was explained in two different models. In the first model the hydroxyl group of 4(R)Hyp is thought to form water bridges between backbone groups, and in the second model the inductive effect of the hydroxyl group influences the ring puckering of the pyrrolidine ring and changes the cis/trans ratio of the peptide bond. The triple helix of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 shows a preference of down puckering of the proline ring in the Xaa position and an up puckering of the proline ring in the Yaa position. Previous studies have shown that the -Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro-tripeptide units destabilize the triple helix (19Inouye K. Kobayashi Y. Kyogoku Y. Kishida Y. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This is explained by the preference of up puckering of the proline ring of 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position, and, conversely, it also explains the stabilizing effect of 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa position. Therefore, we hypothesized that Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 should have an intermediate stability between Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. However, the experimental data (Figs. 2 and 3) indicate that Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is a little more stable than Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. The unfolding of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 measured by CD and DSC shows that the thermal transition is broader than that of Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. This is consistent with the smaller enthalpy change observed by CD and DSC for the transition of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. However, this smaller enthalpy change is compensated by a smaller entropy change, which results in a higher Tm for Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. The presence of 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position, with a “wrong” pyrrolidine ring puckering for that position, results in a less tight triple helix, in which the amide hydrogens of glycine exchange with solvent faster than in the triple helix formed by Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. Additional stabilization of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 might come from the higher trans/cis ratio of peptide bonds in the denatured state. The magnitude of the difference in the enthalpy and entropy changes observed for the two peptides could also indicate that the two denatured states are significantly different. For Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 the CD signal at 225 nm remains positive for the denatured state. Poly(4(R)-hydroxyproline) was shown to form a hydrogen-bonded left-handed helix in aqueous solutions whose CD spectra had a negative peak at 205 nm and a positive peak at 225 nm (52Brahmachari S.K. Bansal M. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Sasisekharan V. Macromolecules. 1979; 12: 23-28Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The negative peak of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 shifts from 197 to 203 nm with increasing temperature, while the positive peak remains at 225 nm, indicating that this peptide does not change the conformation drastically when transitioning to a monomeric, non-triple helical state. This is a similar finding as for the unfolded state of Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, a peptide that does not form a triple helix (49Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 282-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the structure of this peptide, the possibility of a polyproline II-like conformation has been suggested. This is consistent with the higher stability of poly(4(R)Hyp) helices compared with polyproline helices (52Brahmachari S.K. Bansal M. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Sasisekharan V. Macromolecules. 1979; 12: 23-28Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The conformation of the thermally denatured state of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is experimentally not very accessible, due to the high Tm. The stability of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is also consistent with the stabilizing influence of 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position, as long as the Yaa position is not proline (22Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32373-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, two reports were published showing that H-(4(S)Flp-Pro-Gly)7-OH (17Hodges J.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9262-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and H-(4(S)Flp-Pro-Gly)10-OH (18Doi M. Nishi Y. Uchiyama S. Nishiuchi Y. Nakazawa T. Ohkubo T. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9922-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) form a triple helix in aqueous solution. If the pyrrolidine ring structure and inducing dihedral angles contribute significantly to the triple helix stability, -Gly-4(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp-peptide should form a very stable helix, unless there is steric hindrance. Vitagliano et al. (27Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) predicted steric hindrance by modeling, if the proline in the Xaa position of -(Pro-Pro-Gly)n-triple helix is replaced by 4(S)Hyp. Quantum mechanical studies also come to this conclusion (25Improta R. Mele F. Crescenzi O. Benzi C. Barone V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7857-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, this steric hindrance might be minimized by peptides with 4(S)Flp, which is smaller than 4(S)Hyp (17Hodges J.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9262-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Replacing the hydroxyl group with fluorine results in little steric hindrance. The occurrence of 4(R)Hyp in the Xaa position is mostly found in collagens of invertebrates (9Gaill F. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 53Goldstein A. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5478-5483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No collagen sequences with Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp tripeptide units have been identified. However, it was shown recently that 4(R)Hyp can be incorporated in both the Xaa and Yaa positions of a collagen-like molecule in Escherichia coli when the NaCl concentration is high (54Buechter D.D.

Our results show that comparable stabilities should be obtained for collagen-like peptides expressed in this system. Collagen has been used extensively for tissue engineering purposes (55Olsen D. Yang C. Bodo M. Chang R. Leigh S. Baez J. Carmichael D. Perala M. Hamalainen E.R. Jarvinen M. Polarek J. Adv.

For such purposes, the regulation of the triple helical stability is important, and collagenous peptides or recombinant collagen molecules with Gly-4(R)Hyp-4(R)Hyp tripeptide units might be useful.

https://openalex.org/W2095105459,"The mammalian BAD protein belongs to the BH3-only subgroup of the BCL-2 family. In contrast to its known pro-apoptotic function, we found that endogenous and overexpressed BADL can inhibit cell death in neurons and other cell types. Several mechanisms regulate the conversion of BAD from an anti-death to a pro-death factor, including alternative splicing that produces the N-terminally truncated BADS. In addition, caspases convert BADL into a pro-death fragment that resembles the short splice variant. The caspase site that is selectively cleaved during cell death following growth factor (interleukin-3) withdrawal is conserved between human and murine BAD. A second cleavage site that is required for murine BAD to promote death following Sindbis virus infection, γ-irradiation, and staurosporine treatment is not conserved in human BAD, consistent with the inability of human BAD to promote death with these stimuli. However, loss of the BAD N terminus by any mechanism is not always sufficient to activate its pro-death activity, suggesting that the N terminus is a regulatory domain rather than an anti-death domain. These findings suggest that BAD is more than an inert death factor in healthy cells; it is also a pro-survival factor, prior to its role in promoting cell death.

Healthy mammalian cells constitutively express pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members such as the BH3-only protein BAD and the multidomain proteins BAX and BAK. These proteins are generally regarded as latent death factors that are normally held in check and must be activated to exhibit their death-inducing functions. However, it is possible that pro-death BCL-2 family proteins are not only latent death factors but also carry out important functions in healthy cells. Consistent with this idea, BAX and BAK can function as potent anti-death factors in cultured neurons and in mouse models (1Lewis J. Oyler G.A. Ueno K. Fannjiang Y. Chau B.N. Vornov J. Korsmeyer S.J.

This dual function of BAK may be explained by its ability to decrease neuronal excitability in healthy neurons because this function is consistent with both its ability to promote death during development (based on the phenotype of double Bax/Bak knock-out mice) and to inhibit death induced by excitotoxic stimuli in postnatal animals (4Fannjiang Y.

Several mechanisms appear to contribute to the activation of the pro-death function of Bcl-2 family proteins.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how BAD and other BH3-only proteins facilitate cell death by inhibiting anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, by activating pro-death BAX and BAK, or by regulating mitochondrial structure (16Cheng E.H.Y.

BAD plays an important role in connecting the growth factor signaling pathway with the cell death pathway. Recent genetic evidence confirms that when a variety of cell types are deprived of their extracellular survival signals, BAD is dephosphorylated to assume its pro-death function (19Datta S.R. Ranger A.M. Lin M.Z. Sturgill J.F. Ma Y.C. Cowan C.W. Dikkes P. Korsmeyer S.J. Greenberg M.E. Dev.

Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although it is logical that the pro-death function of BAD must be inactivated or suppressed in healthy cells, this does not preclude the possibility that BAD and other pro-death BCL-2 family proteins have anti-death activity or alternative biochemical functions that benefit healthy cells prior to receiving a death stimulus. Analogously, cytochrome c has a key function in the mitochondrial respiratory chain of healthy cells but promotes caspase activation in the cytosol following a death stimulus (21Liu X. Kin C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). BAD-deficient mice are developmentally normal by most criteria, including normal B and T cell development (20Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P. Kutok J.L. Le Beau M.M. Greenberg M.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, isolated thymocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells from BAD-deficient mice were found to be variably resistant to cell death induced by growth factor withdrawal, consistent with a pro-death function of BAD under these conditions (20Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P. Kutok J.L. Le Beau M.M. Greenberg M.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BAD-deficient mice develop B cell lymphomas and other malignancies, and this propensity is dramatically increased by exposure to limited γ-irradiation (20Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P. Kutok J.L. Le Beau M.M. Greenberg M.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Again, this tumor suppressor phenotype is consistent with a pro-death function for BAD; however, seemingly inconsistent with a pro-death function, BAD was reported to promote glycolysis, a pathway induced by the same growth factors that “inactivate” the pro-death function of BAD (22Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). That is, BAD-deficient mice and derived hepatocytes have a reduced capacity to utilize glucose apparently because of the requirement for BAD to assemble active glucokinase (liver hexokinase) complexes (22Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Thus, it is paradoxical that a pro-death factor facilitates utilization of glucose in the first step of the glycolytic pathway. This paradox could be resolved if, prior to its conversion to a pro-death factor, BAD has a normal cellular function that promotes maintenance/survival of the cell, but BAD and other BH3-only proteins have not previously been found to play a physiological role in promoting cell survival. Here we show that BAD can function as a potent inhibitor of cell death and is converted into a pro-death factor by multiple mechanisms that alter or inactivate the BAD N terminus. These include splicing, dephosphorylation, and caspase cleavage at death stimulus-specific sites. The N terminus of BAD is important but not essential for anti-death function in all paradigms, suggesting that the N terminus is a guard against activation of pro-death function rather than a direct anti-death domain. These findings are consistent with the possibility that other “pro-death” Bcl-2 family proteins may have normal cell functions that promote survival. Plasmids and Transfections—Murine BADL (Stratagene) and human BADS (Science Reagents) cDNAs were inserted into pSG5 (Stratagene) or derivative pDB59 (containing an N-terminal HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IL, interleukin; PI, propidium iodide; mBAD, murine BAD; hBAD, human BAD; SV, Sindbis virus; BHK, baby hamster kidney; HEK, human embryonic kidney. tag) for expression in mammalian cells or in vitro transcription/translation. Point mutants of BAD were generated by two-step PCR, and those clones with a perfect sequence were selected for further study. Cell lines were transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). Primary cortical neurons were transfected with calcium phosphate as described previously (23Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1995; 15: 89-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 24Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the media of cortical neurons were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and saved. DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate was prepared by mixing 1 μg of GFP plasmid and 5 μg of the expression vector for wild type or D61A mBAD in 250 mm CaCl2 with 2× Hepes-buffered saline solution (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm d-glucose, 42 mm Hepes, pH 7.05). After 25–30 min, 120 μl of the DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate were added dropwise to each 60-mm-diameter dish and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator. Twenty-five min after the first precipitate formed, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and returned to the saved medium. Viruses and Animals—Coding sequences for wild type and mutant BAD were subcloned from pSG5/pDB59 into the Sindbis virus vectors dsTE12Q (for infection of newborn mice) and dsNSV (for infection of 5-week-old mice) (3Kerr D.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for generating recombinant viruses. Control Sindbis viruses contain the reverse (non-coding) orientations of mBADL, viral KSBcl-2, or other irrelevant cDNA of similar size to ensure equivalent replication rates between viruses by maintaining the same genome size in experimental and control viruses. The data obtained with various control viruses were indistinguishable (thereby eliminating concerns about antisense effects on mBAD). Data presented here were generated with Sindbis viruses prepared from at least two independently derived constructs. Mice were inoculated by intracranial injection with 5000 plaque-forming units of Sindbis virus or with buffer diluent alone. Cultured cell lines and dissociated rat or mouse primary cortical neurons were infected with 5 plaque-forming units/cell. Organotypic cultures were infected with 5 × 106 plaque-forming units/tissue slice. BAD knock-out mice and genotyping strategy were described previously (20Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P. Kutok J.L. Le Beau M.M. Greenberg M.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The BAD knock-out mice were backcrossed once to a C57BL/6 mouse, and the colony was interbred over a 2-year period. All experiments were performed on littermates from heterozygous crosses and subsequently correlated to the genotype. Cell Lines, Viability Assays, and Immunoblots—COS-1 (African green monkey kidney), BHK (baby hamster kidney), and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Ba/F3 (murine hematopoietic) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with IL-3 (26Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Stable BHK cell lines were established by co-transfection with a neomycin-resistant plasmid (at a 1:10 ratio with BAD-expressing plasmids) and selected in 0.5 μg/ml G418. Individual clones were separated, maintained in G418, and analyzed only at low passage numbers. Cell lysates were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (aprotinin, benzamidine, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. Viability of various cell lines was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy, or by co-transfection or β-galactosidase assay as described previously (27Bellows D.S. Howell M. Pearson C. Hazlewood S.A. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2469-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death was performed as described previously (7Cheng E.H.Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M.

Primary Neurons—Dissociated cultures of (postmitotic) cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 15-16 Sprague-Dawley rats or embryonic day 13-14 mice as described previously (23Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1995; 15: 89-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and plated in 24-well dishes (1 × 105/well) with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine from days 3 to 6 after plating to inhibit expansion of non-neuronal cells that constitute <10% of the cultures (data not shown). Death of the infected cortical neurons was assessed by determining the percentage of neurons that were stained with PI relative to the total number of Hoechst-stained nuclei. Randomly selected fields were imaged and printed for counting. N-methyl-d-aspartate and staurosporine treatments were performed (4Fannjiang Y. Kim C.-H.R.L. Huganir R.L. Zou S. Lindsten T.

Those cells with no processes or with two or more fragmented processes were scored as non-viable. Hippocampal and spinal cord tissues were dissected from newborn mice, and four 200-μm slices were cultured on one Millipore membrane per well with basal medium Eagle (Invitrogen) plus 25% horse serum in 6-well dishes (28Vornov J.J. Tasker R.C. Park J. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 133: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The viability of organotypic hippocampal or spinal cord cultures was assessed by incubating cultures for 16 h in 0.1 mg/ml PI. Relative PI intensity was determined by computer-based image analysis (4Fannjiang Y. Kim C.-H.R.L. Huganir R.L. Zou S. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mito T. Traystman R.J. Larsen T. Griffin D.E.

In Vitro Caspase Cleavage—35S-Labeled, in vitro transcribed and translated proteins were digested with recombinant purified caspase-3 (2000 units) or caspase-7 (750 units) as described previously (29Bellows D.S. Chau B.N. Lee P. Lazebnik Y. Burns W.H. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BAD Switches from Anti-death to Pro-death Function during Neuron Maturation—Sindbis virus can induce classic morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell lines and in neurons (30Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 31Lewis J. Wesselingh S.L. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of Sindbis virus as a vector to express both anti- and pro-death BCL-2 family proteins in cell cultures and in animals has faithfully revealed the endogenous function of these proteins (1Lewis J. Oyler G.A. Ueno K. Fannjiang Y. Chau B.N. Vornov J. Korsmeyer S.J. Zou S. Hardwick J.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Fannjiang Y. Kim C.-H.R.L. Huganir R.L.

Therefore, the function of BAD was quantified by inserting a cDNA encoding the widely studied long form of murine BAD into the Sindbis virus genome and measuring the ability of mBADL to modulate the outcome of a Sindbis virus infection. Infection of COS-1 cells with recombinant Sindbis virus encoding murine BADL (SV-mBADL) confirmed the expected pro-death function of transiently overexpressed mBADL. That is, BAD accelerated Sindbis virus-induced cell death compared with control viruses (SV-control) (Figs. 1A and 4B). In contrast, BCL-xL inhibited Sindbis virus-induced cell death as reported previously (33Cheng E.H.Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Murine BAD enhances cell death, whereas uncleavable BAD suppresses cell death in transient assays.A, percentage of death of HEK293 cells at 48 h after transfection of the indicated plasmids was determined by morphology.

S. A. 1996; 93: 4810-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Contrary to expectation, mBADL significantly reduced Sindbis virus-induced neuronal death compared with control virus-infected cultures, suggesting that mBADL protects hippocampal neurons from virus-induced death (Figs. 1B and 7B). In contrast, another pro-death BH3-only family member, BIMS, was a potent pro-death factor in this model (Fig. 1B). This finding with BIM strongly argues against the possibility that the anti-death function of BAD results from the indirect effects of its pro-death function. To determine whether endogenous BAD is an anti-death factor in neurons, dissociated embryonic cortical neurons were prepared from bad-deficient mice and infected with Sindbis virus as a death stimulus. Consistent with the overexpression model, more cell death occurred in bad-/- cortical neurons and spinal cord slices compared with cultures prepared from bad+/+ or bad+/- control littermates, indicating that endogenous BAD is protective in these immature neurons (Fig. 1C). Spinal cord slice cultures prepared from newborn bad+/+ and bad-/- mice yielded similar results when exposed to Sindbis virus or N-methyl-d-aspartate to induce an excitotoxic death. Thus, endogenous BAD also protects neurons against a non-viral death stimulus. Confidence in these findings is enhanced because they were generated in primary cells derived from several different animals per genotype. Genotypes of cultures and mice were confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1D). The tropism of Sindbis virus for central nervous system neurons in mice results in neuronal death that strongly correlates with mouse mortality (4Fannjiang Y. Kim C.-H.R.L. Huganir R.L. Zou S. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mito T. Traystman R.J. Larsen T. Griffin D.E. Mandir A.S. Dawson T.M. Dike S. Sappington A.L. Kerr D.A. Jonas E.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Hardwick J.M. Dev.

Virol. 1996; 70: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, endogenous and overexpressed BCL-2 (via the Sindbis virus vector) protects newborn mice from neuronal apoptosis (32Hardwick J.M. Lewis J. Zou S. Cheng E.H.Y. Kirsch D.G. Bellows D.S. Chau N. Oyler G.A. Ueno K. Zhang J. Clem R.J. Ruffolo R.R. Walsh F. Apoptosis in Health and Disease. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam2000: 195-213Google Scholar, 34Levine B. Goldman J.E. Jiang H.H. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4810-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, BAD was evaluated by a similar approach. Infection of newborn bad-deficient mice with Sindbis virus (SV-control) caused increased mouse mortality compared with control bad+/+ and bad-/- littermates, consistent with a protective function of BAD (data not shown). However, the interpretation of this result is complicated by the fact that these mice are defective for production of antigen-stimulated antibody (20Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P. Kutok J.L. Le Beau M.M. Greenberg M.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which is critical for clearing Sindbis virus from infected mouse brains (35Levine B. Hardwick J.M. Trapp B.D. Crawford T.O. Bollinger R.C. Griffin D.E. Science. 1991; 254: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm that BAD protects in animals, 3-day-old wild type mice were infected with recombinant Sindbis virus expressing mBADL. These mice had increased survival compared with those infected with control virus, consistent with the protective function of mBADL (Fig. 1E). In contrast, the pro-death BH3-only protein BIMS significantly accelerated mouse mortality, arguing that the protective effect is specific to mBADL (Fig. 1E). In contrast to newborn mice, mBADL failed to significantly alter the rate or extent of mortality in mature (5-week-old) mice (Fig. 1E). To confirm this age-dependent shift in BAD function using an alternate model, BAD was evaluated in dissociated embryonic rat cortical neurons that were allowed to mature in culture 2–14 days prior to infection. Overexpression of mBADL (SV-mBADL) protected 2 day-old cultures, similar to the function of endogenous BAD (compare Fig. 1, C and F). Unlike BAD, BAX was modestly pro-death in these cells as expected. In contrast to the younger cultures, mBADL exhibited consistent pro-death activity in 8–14-day-old cultures (Fig. 1F). Viability of cortical neurons was determined by dual staining with Hoechst to detect nuclei and PI to detect dead cells as shown for representative fields (Fig. 1G). These findings indicate that BAD is converted from a pro-survival to a pro-death or neutral factor as postmitotic cortical neurons mature in culture and in vivo (Fig. 1H). Caspase Cleavage of mBAD Promotes Age-dependent Neuronal Death—To pursue the mechanisms responsible for converting BAD into a pro-death factor as neurons mature, a role for proteolysis was examined based on the observation that other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members can be converted into killer proteins when cleaved by caspases (7Cheng E.H.Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). In addition, the pro-death function of murine BAD was reported to be enhanced when BAD is cleaved by caspases at Asp-56 and Asp-61 (36Condorelli F. Salomoni P. Cotteret S. Cesi V. Srinivasula S.M. Elnemri E.S. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell.

Although the sizes and primary sequences among IF proteins can vary considerably, they all share a common predicted domain structure consisting of a central rod domain flanked by head and tail domains (see Fig. 1 for a schematic). The central rod domain of IF proteins is ∼310 amino acids in length and shows a strong conservation of the predicted secondary structure. The rod domain is divisible into larger “coil” subdomains predicted to be α helical, joined by short “linker” domains whose sequence does not predict α helicity. Further, the coil domains exhibit a heptad repeat pattern characteristic of proteins that assemble into coiled coil dimers. In this heptad repeat, the first and fourth residues (“a” and “d” positions) are largely hydrophobic and form a hydrophobic “stripe” along one side of the helix. This stripe is the apposing interface between two monomers that assemble into a coiled coil dimer (6Herrmann H. Herrmann H. Robin J. Intermediate Filaments. 31. Plenum Press, New York1998: 319-355Google Scholar). Rigorous demonstration that a particular amino acid or region is α helical or coiled coil has been provided by x-ray crystallography of vimentin fragments and by our initial EPR studies (7Strelkov S.V.

Subsequent removal of the urea or guanidine by dialysis allows for the spontaneous reassembly of denatured proteins into native-looking IFs (11Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Zimmerman S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 108: 547-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Renner W. Franke W.W. Schmid E. Geisler N. Weber K. Mandelkow E. J. Mol.

Although this feature is beneficial to the study of IF assembly in vitro, it has created great difficulties in efforts to generate IF protein crystals suitable for high-resolution structural studies. Because of the inability to crystallize intact IF proteins some investigators have taken a “divide and conquer” approach by generating crystals of IF protein fragments or of chimeric proteins that include IF fragments. These data have revealed the structure of small regions containing α helical dimers, including the perplexing “stutter” region within rod 2b (7Strelkov S.V. Herrmann H. Geisler N. Wedig T.

The degree to which the crystal structure of the isolated fragments resembles that of those same regions in intact filaments will need to be confirmed.The determination of the architecture of IF proteins within intact filaments has also proven difficult to approach experimentally. Our understanding of the architecture of intact filaments and the assembly process required to reach that point has been postulated on the basis of evidence derived from a number of approaches including cross-linking studies, secondary structural predictions, circular dichroism, extrapolation from studies of proteins exhibiting similar predicted secondary structure, sedimentation studies, size exclusion chromatography, and so forth (14Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D. Parry D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 15Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. J. Biol.

These studies collectively have led to a long-standing model of IF assembly that starts with the formation of an in-parallel and in-register coiled coil dimer. Subsequent assembly is predicted to consist of the formation of a tetramer composed of two anti-parallel, staggered dimers.The cross-linking of K5 and K14 keratins in low ionic strength triethanolamine buffers (an in vitro assembly protocol that results in small subunits referred to as “protofilaments”) has produced data supporting the existence of two different tetramer alignments (14Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D. Parry D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 18Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10046-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These same data show that both tetramer alignments exist in a hexamer, as well as in the assembled filament. Direct testing of this model, however, has proven difficult to accomplish. Subsequent cross-linking analysis has revealed the importance of residues in rod 1A and linker 2 in stabilizing the A11 alignment (so-called because rod 1 domains of two dimers are apposed in a tetramer) (19Mehrani T. Wu K.C. Morasso M.I. Bryan J.T. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2088-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that the A11 alignment is more stable than the A22 alignment (where the rod 2 domains are aligned).Vimentin exists mainly in the monomeric form in solutions above 6 m urea, assembling into dimers at near 5 m and tetramers at 3 m urea concentrations (17Rogers K.R. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U.

A cross-linking of the single cysteine in wild type vimentin has been cited as evidence for an A22 tetramer formation in soluble vimentin (17Rogers K.R. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of proteolytically prepared desmin rods that are filament assembly-incompetent in low ionic strength ethanolamine demonstrates an A11 structure (22Geisler N. Schunemann J. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 841-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This alignment was also demonstrated in full-length desmin IFs subjected to cross-linking.We have previously reported the utility of SDSL and EPR in contributing to the understanding of IF architecture, using the human type III IF protein vimentin as a model (10Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this approach a spin label is introduced to specific sites within the protein, and the protein is induced to assemble into intermediate filaments. The resulting filaments are examined by EPR in physiologic solution and in real time. The spectra yields basic information about the secondary structure at the site of the spin label, as well as the proximity of spin labels to one another. In our previous study we placed spin labels at 14 successive residues in vimentin rod domain 2 and generated direct evidence that this region engages in a coiled coil dimer formation. By introducing spin labels at the exterior surface of a dimer we explored the architecture of dimer-dimer interactions and provided evidence that two dimers are oriented in an anti-parallel manner with an overlap at residue 348.Using the same approach, we have now characterized vimentin structure in rod 1, identified the orientation and point of overlap between dimers in this region, and have deduced a sequence of steps that accompany the in vitro assembly of vimentin filaments. These data describe the structure of the vimentin IF and establish an approach for evaluating how specific mutations impact filament assembly.MATERIALS AND METHODSVimentin characterization, mutation, cloning, expression, purification, and spin labeling were described in detail in a previous report (10Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, the spin label is ultimately attached to cysteine residues, so mutations that create cysteines were introduced into the vimentin expression construct (generously provided by Dr. Roy Quinlan, University of Durham, Durham, UK) at specific sites using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. Sequence changes were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant vimentin was produced by bacterial expression and was purified from inclusion bodies using high/low salt washes and chromatography. Spin labeling was accomplished by incubation of the purified vimentin in 100 μm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, hydrochloride (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) followed by 500 μm O-87500 (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada). The unincorporated spin label was removed by CM-Sepharose chromatography (10Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using an Amersham Biosciences FPLC. The labeled proteins were stored long term at –80 °C.The filament assembly was performed either as a single step dialysis against filament assembly buffer, or a stepwise process as described by Carter et al. (13Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled proteins were solubilized in 8 m urea, which was then removed by dialysis either in a single step procedure or, where indicated, in a stepwise process through progressively reduced concentrations of urea followed by low ionic strength Tris and then by the addition of NaCl and MgCl2. Filament assembly was verified each time by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. As reported in Fig. 1 some mutations were not capable of assembling into filaments.EPR was conducted on a JEOL X-band spectrometer equipped with a loop gap resonator (23Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Approximately 4 μl of sample, at a concentration of 25–75 μm protein, were placed in a sealed quartz capillary tube. Spectra were acquired at 20–22 °C with a single 60s scan over 100 G at a microwave power of 2 mW, and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width of the attached nitroxide.RESULTSRod 1 Monomer-Monomer Interactions—A schematic of the vimentin monomer is presented in Fig. 1. The amino acid sequence at this site is presented. The position of each amino acid in the heptad repeat pattern is indicated by notations of a–g. This heptad repeat is thought to impose a coiled coil assembly of polypeptide chains. Residues within the region of 169–193 that were changed to cysteine, spin labeled, and examined by EPR are presented in Fig. 2. For each position the spectra reflect moderate to strong side chain motion, indicating a region of fixed secondary structure with varied levels of side chain contact.Fig. 2Room temperature EPR spectra of 21 different spinlabeled mutants of human vimentin. The location of the spin label is indicated by the residue number at the left edge of the spectrum. Residues predicted to occupy an “a” or “d” position in the heptad repeat are indicated by *. The spectrum for mutant 192 has been amplified 4×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The spectra in Fig. 2 are normalized to represent the same number of spins. Here it can be seen that some spectra display severe broadening, indicative of magnetic dipolar interaction between labels situated within 2.0 nm of one another. Modeling of coiled coil dimer interactions predicts that if the dimer is aligned in-parallel and in-register spectra from spin labels in the a and d positions would show evidence of close proximity whereas those in the b, c, e, f, and g positions would show evidence of more distant interactions. As is apparent in Fig. 2, the a/d positions of 171, 175, 178, 189, and 192 (indicated by *) are more broadened than other positions within the range of 169–188. More moderate broadening (discussed below) is seen from positions 190, 191, and 193. Thus the EPR spectra provide direct support for the coiled coil dimer prediction within this region of rod 1B.Because the spectral shapes shown in Fig. 2 depend on both the side chain mobility and the proximity of nitroxides on neighboring subunits, the analysis for the strength of the dipolar interaction can be simplified by freezing the sample to arrest all motions influencing the nitroxide line shape. The –100 °C spectra for vimentin samples harboring spin labels at positions 184, 189, 190, 191, and 192 are given in Fig. 3. A model-independent evaluation of the magnetic interaction strength can be obtained from the broadening parameter d1/d (24Kokorin A.I. Zamaraev K.I. Grigorian G.L. Ivanov V.P. Rozantsev E.G. Biofizika. 1972; 17: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar) whose value for spins >2.0 nm apart is ∼0.3 but increases as labels are brought into closer proximity. As suggested by the room temperature spectra in Fig. 2, labels located at position 184 do not show appreciable interaction (d1/d = 0.33), whereas labels located at position 192 show the strongest interaction (d1/d = 0.50). Position 192 is a predicted “d” position and as such, would be expected to have a d1/d ratio approaching 0.5 (10Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ratio of 0.5 is undoubtedly because of the intradimer proximity (d-d interaction in a coiled coil) plus the proximity of another spin-labeled dimer. Also consistent with the room temperature data, the non-a/d positions of 190 and 191 show dipolar interaction indicating that these positions approach one another in intact filaments.Fig. 3EPR spectra of frozen vimentin mutants spin-labeled at the indicated position. Samples containing more proximal labels display greater broadening. The extent of broadening is revealed by the qualitative parameter d1/d, which is larger for labels experiencing greater dipolar interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Dimer-Dimer Overlap in Rod Domain 1—In a previous report we introduced spin labels along the exterior surface of a dimer, and established in intact filaments that two dimers overlap at residue 348 in rod domain 2 (see Fig. 4 for orientation). To determine whether these dimers were parallel or anti-parallel we mixed samples containing spin labels located upstream and downstream of position 348 to distinguish a parallel from anti-parallel associations of the dimers. We reasoned that spin labels placed downstream from residue 348, at residue 334, would align opposite 334 if the dimers were aligned in-parallel but would oppose a residue located an equivalent distance upstream if the dimers were in an anti-parallel arrangement. These experiments established that residues 334 and 359 were directly apposed providing evidence for an antiparallel and staggered overlap for two adjacent dimers at this site. However, a cross-section of an intermediate filament is postulated to contain ∼16 dimers, thus a given dimer has the potential to interact with several other dimers.Fig. 4Schematic view of three vimentin dimers. SDSL EPR establishes that a given vimentin dimer interacts with rod domain 2 of one dimer (position 348) and rod domain 1 of another dimer (position 191). Both interactions are anti-parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The overlap of two dimers at residue 348 in rod 2 presages an interaction between the free rod 1 domains. We sought evidence for such an overlap by introducing spin labels along the exterior surface of the dimer in the rod 1 region (positions 169–193). This analysis revealed that residues 187, 188, 190, 191, and 193 (none of which are in a or d positions of the heptad) show significant broadening because of magnetic interaction, with 191 yielding the strongest interaction. In addition, position 192 shows the strongest self-interaction for any residue yet examined in vimentin. Thus the broadening centered near position 191 indicates an interaction between dimers or higher level oligomers, consistent with the A11 alignment shown in Fig. 4. We concluded that the severe broadening seen at position 192 arises from a combination of the d-d interaction from two parallel coiled coil monomers, as well as interaction of the labels located on separate dimers overlapping near position 191 (discussed below).To establish the orientation of dimers that overlap at residue 191 we used the same approach described previously for the overlap at 348 (10Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, equal molar amounts of two separately labeled mutants were combined and examined by EPR spectroscopy. These mixtures contained one protein with a spin label attached upstream of position 191 and a second mutant protein with the label attached an equivalent distance downstream of residue 191. The observed interaction in frozen spectra from mixtures of single-labeled 184 or 188 with an equal amount of vimentin labeled at 197 or 193, respectively, resulted in a higher d1/d value than any of the single mutants alone (Table I). This thus confirms that rod 1 of one dimer overlaps near residue 191 with another dimer and that these two regions are arranged in an anti-parallel orientation. The precise points of overlap between one vimentin dimer and two of its neighbors and the orientation of those neighbors have now been established in intact filaments in physiologic solution.Table IObserved interaction in frozen spectraSpin-labeled residued1/d1840.331880.381930.381970.40184 + 1970.48188 + 1930.50 Open table in a new tab Sequencing of in Vitro Assembly Steps—The data reported thus far have been performed on the end stage of filament assembly procedures, i.e. on intact filaments. We decided to explore whether the various events of assembly that have been documented could be placed in sequence by gathering spectra from intermediates of assembly that emerged during dialysis to progressively lower urea concentrations. We selected different mutants, because each could serve as an “indicator” for specific phases of the assembly process. First, we examined residue 333, located in a d position in rod domain 2, to observe both the assumption of α helicity as well as the formation of the coiled coil dimer. We also chose two non-a/d positions in the central rod domain to reveal the stage where overlap between dimers occurs. Residues 191 and 348 were selected to report the formation of the dimer-dimer interactions centered in rod 1 and rod 2, respectively.Spectra from mutant 333, a d position in rod 2, showed that the first indications of backbone stabilization occur at ∼6 m urea and continue to undergo progressive constraint through 1 m urea (Fig. 5). This demonstrates that the initiation of the α helix formation occurs at ∼6 m urea with a progressive stabilization of the backbone of the helix as dialysis progresses. The first significant line shape change occurs at the high field (mI = +1) line at 5 m urea, suggesting the presence of some loosely associated dimer at this urea level. This agrees with centrifugation and cross-linking measurements, which suggest that a dimer of vimentin is formed at 5 m urea (17Rogers K.R. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) Interestingly, although the dipolar broadening is not substantially increased as the urea concentration is lowered from 2 m, the tight packing of the position 333 side chain side is not accomplished until the urea is lowered to 1 m. The 1 m spectrum of position 333 features the broad splittings indicative of a strongly immobilized side chain and is identical to the spectrum of the sample in the absence of urea (10Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)Fig. 5Influence of urea on the EPR Spectrum of vimentin spin labeled at residue 333 of rod domain 2. This residue is predicted to occupy a “d” position in the heptad and thus to serve as an indicator of both α helix formation and coiled coil formation. Spectra of assembly intermediates were taken from samples harvested during stepwise dialysis, and are normalized for the protein concentration in each sample. The concentration of urea at which the spectrum was taken is indicated in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6 shows the results of experiments to probe the association of dimers from non-a/d positions in rods 1 and 2. Significant evidence for dimer-dimer interaction at residue 191 of rod domain 1 emerges first in the transition to 4 m urea, whereas evidence of dipolar broadening at position 348 is not clear until 2 m urea. Thus these results show that with urea-solubilized vimentin, dimer formation occurs earlier at the A11 alignment (as reported by the label in rod 1) than at the A22 alignment. A dimer-dimer interaction of residue 348 emerges in the transition to 2 m urea.Fig. 6EPR spectra of vimentin spin-labeled at residue 191 (upper) and residue 348 (lower) at a range of urea concentrations. Samples removed from a stepwise dialysis were scanned by EPR, and the spectra were plotted to represent a normalized concentration of vimentin. The molar urea concentration against which each sample was equilibrated is indicated. Residue 348 of rod domain 2 is predicted to occupy an “e” position of the heptad and has been shown previously to be close to the point of overlap formed by adjacent vimentin dimers. The dipolar interaction at residue 191 of rod domain 1 (predicted to occupy a “c” position in the heptad) indicates that this residue is near a second point of overlap between adjacent vimentin dimers. Dipolar broadening at 191 occurs at higher urea concentrations, suggesting that the A11 association occurs more readily than the A22 association.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn a previous report we provided direct evidence of an α helical coiled coil formation in the rod domain 2 of human vimentin and that these regions were aligned in-parallel and in exact register (10Hess J.F. Voss J.C. FitzGerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35516-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Identification of the pattern of spectra recorded as spin labels are moved to successive positions in the heptad allowed us to conclude that additional amino acids were in an α helical coiled coil conformation. Last, we demonstrated that spin labels on the exterior of the helix could be used to identify dimer-dimer interactions. We now provide similar data relevant to the structure of monomer-monomer interaction in rod 1B domain. Specifically we provided evidence that residues 169 to 193 of rod domain 1B are arranged as a coiled coil dimer and that the dimers are aligned in-parallel and in-register.SDSL EPR is particularly powerful in the study of IFs because of the constraints on structure imposed by an elongated and rigid central rod domain. These constraints facilitate modeling and the prediction of sites of overlap between molecules that can be directly tested by SDSL EPR. This is especially relevant to IF proteins, because the number of possible options for interaction is restricted by the rigid structure of the rod domain.By introducing spin labels along the external surface of the dimer in rod 1 we have identified a point of overlap between the rod 1 of one dimer and that of an adjacent dimer as occurring near residues 191–2. Using mixtures of different mutants we established that this staggered alignment is also anti-parallel. This arrangement is simil"

Despite the potential importance of the phenomenon, the number, identities, and properties of these enzymes are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that isolated mitochondria from rat brain cortex, incubated in the absence of respiratory substrates, release a Ca2+-dependent PLA2 having biochemical properties characteristic to secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) and immunoreacting with the antibody raised against recombinant type IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA). Under identical conditions, no release of fumarase in the extramitochondrial medium was observed. The release of sPLA2 from mitochondria decreases when mitochondria are incubated in the presence of respiratory substrates such as ADP, malate, and pyruvate, which causes an increase of transmembrane potential determined by cytofluorimetric analysis using DiOC6(3) as a probe. The treatment of mitochondria with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone slightly enhances sPLA2 release. The increase of sPLA2 specific activity after removal of mitochondrial outer membrane indicates that the enzyme is associated with mitoplasts. The mitochondrial localization of the enzyme has been confirmed by electron microscopy in U-251 astrocytoma cells and by confocal laser microscopy in the same cells and in PC-12 cells, where the structurally similar isoform type V-sPLA2 has mainly nuclear localization. In addition to sPLA2, mitochondria contain another phospholipase A2 that is Ca2+-independent and sensitive to bromoenol lactone, associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane.

Because this position is rich in arachidonic acid, great attention has been devoted to the relationship between activation of PLA2 and the production of eicosanoids (1Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kuwata H. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

A large body of evidence supports the notion that this class of enzyme is involved in chronic neurodegenerative disease (7Farooqui A.A. Yang H.C. Horrocks L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 30: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is now well established that various isoforms of phospholipase A2 are present in brain tissue (8Farooqui A.A. Yang H.C. Rosenberger T.A. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that each of them should have specific roles depending on their cellular and subcellular localization, the metabolic state of the cell, and response to extracellular stimuli. Three main classes of PLA2 have been found in brain tissue: cytosolic Ca2+-dependent (cPLA2), cytosolic Ca2+-independent (iPLA2), and secretory (sPLA2) (8Farooqui A.A. Yang H.C. Rosenberger T.A. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Yang H-C. Mosior M. Ni B.H. Dennis E.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) but their roles in various physiological or pathological events are still largely unclear. Particular attention has been devoted to type IV-cPLA2 because this enzyme shows a great specificity for arachidonic acid, and it is very likely to be involved in the production of eicosanoids after receptor-mediated activation of the enzyme (10Hernandez M. Bayon Y. Sanchez C.M. Nieto M.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Evidence has been also reported suggesting its involvement in neurodegeneration (7Farooqui A.A. Yang H.C. Horrocks L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 30: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In fact, cPLA2 seems to be present in reactive glial cells, particularly in regions of neuronal loss, and it is not detectable in those brain regions in which neurons do not degenerate or are protected from death (11Stephenson D. Rash K. Smalstig B. Roberts E. Johnstone E. Sharp J. Panetta J. Little S. Kramer R. Clemens J. Glia. 1999; 27: 110-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, a predominant expression of cPLA2 mRNA in neurons of rat brain has also been reported (12Kishimoto K. Matsumura Y. Kataoka H. Morii H. Watanabe Y. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting its involvement in neurotransmission or other neuronal functions through the generation of such lipid mediators as arachidonic acid, eicosanoids, and platelet-activating factor (13Bonventre J.V. Koroshetz W.J. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 457-471PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kramer R.M. Stephenson D.T. Roberts E.F. Clemens J.A. J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Grassi S. Francescangeli E. Goracci G. Pettorossi V.E. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 6: 3266-3271Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Two Ca2+-independent PLA2s have been isolated from bovine brain cytosol showing different specificities for 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and ethanolamine plasmalogens (16Hirashima Y. Farooqui A. Mills J.S. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recently, an 80-kDa type VI iPLA2 was purified from rat brain (9Yang H-C. Mosior M. Ni B.H. Dennis E.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This enzyme shows a head-group preference for phosphatidylcholine, and its specific activity is 20-50-fold higher than that of type IV-cPLA2 depending on brain areas. Secretory PLA2 types IIA and V are also present in all areas of rat brain, and typeIIA-sPLA2 is the predominant enzyme of this class and is associated with the particulate fraction, whereas type V sPLA2 is mainly found in the soluble fraction (9Yang H-C. Mosior M. Ni B.H. Dennis E.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Secretory PLA2s have a low molecular mass (13-18 kDa), show a low specificity for fatty acids, and require millimolar Ca2+ for full activity. They are widely distributed in animal tissues and extracellular fluids and exert many different functions (17Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). sPLA2-IIA, one of the several groups of this class, was initially purified from synovial fluid (19Hara S. Kudo I. Chang H.W. Matsuta K. Miyamoto T. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 1989; 105: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and platelets (20Kramer R.M. Johansen B. Hession C. Pepinsky R.B. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1990; 20: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymes belonging to this group are also present in the venom of various snake species, and they have a potent neurotoxic effect (21Dorandeu F. Antier D. PernotMarino I. Lapeyre P. Lallement G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 51: 349-359Google Scholar, 22Kolko M. Bruhn T. Christensen T. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. Bazan N.G. Diemer N.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because brain tissue possesses specific presynaptic receptors for sPLA2-IIA from snake venoms, the involvement of an endogenous sPLA2 in neurotransmission seems very likely (22Kolko M. Bruhn T. Christensen T. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. Bazan N.G. Diemer N.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Copic A. Vucemilo N. Gubensek F. Krizaj I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26315-26320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact, exogenous sPLA2 modulates AMPA receptor function (24Massicotte G. Baudry M. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 118: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and an enzyme, immunochemically identical to sPLA2-IIA, has been detected in synaptic vesicles and secreted upon depolarization or by neurotransmitter stimulation (25Matsuzawa A. Murakami M. Atsumi G. Imai K. Prados P. Inoue K. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β induce sPLA2 mRNA and enzymatic activity in immortalized astrocyte cell lines (26Li W. Xia J. Sun G.Y. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the involvement of this group of enzymes in inflammation has been also suggested. The overall message emerging from these reports indicate that, in general, PLA2(s) are involved in physiological mechanisms but they also participate in the development of neurode-generation after short-term ischemia or as the consequence of long-term neurodegenerative diseases. There is a large body of evidence that, in both cases, mitochondrial functions undergo substantial alterations that reduce their capability of producing ATP and address neurons toward necrotic or apoptotic cell death (27Beal M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 28Tatton W.G. Olanow C.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The presence of PLA2 activity in brain mitochondria has been known since the early 1970s (32Bazan N.G.J. Acta Physiol. Lat. Am. 1971; 21: 101-106PubMed Google Scholar, 33Woelk H. Porcellati G. Hoppe-Seyler's. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Goracci G. Porcellati G. Woelk H. Adv. Prostagl. Thromb. Res. 1978; 3: 55-67PubMed Google Scholar), but the identities and the functions of the(se) enzyme(s) are still unclear. More recently, it has been reported that gerbil brain mitochondria contains a PLA2 with an estimated molecular mass of 14 kDa whose activity increases after ischemia and reperfusion (35Rordorf J. Uemura Y. Bonventre J.V. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation and the detection of sPLA2-IIA in rat brain particulate fraction suggests that brain mitochondria might contain a sPLA2, similar to that isolated from liver mitochondria (36Aarsman A.J. de Jong J.G. Arnoldussen E. Neys F.W. van Wassenaar P.D. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10008-10014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it prompted us to verify whether the enzyme could exit from the organelle under impairment of mitochondrial functions, similarly to other mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c and caspase-9 (37Atlante A. Gagliardi S. Marra E. Calissano P. Passerella S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Ellerby L.M. Welsh K. Xie Z.H. Deveraux Q.L. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Rosenthal R.E. Fiskum G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5752-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that mitochondria purified from rat brain cortex and mitochondria of neuron-like PC-12 cells and U-251 astrocytoma cells contain an enzyme having biochemical and immunological properties characteristic of sPLA2-IIA. By contrast, in the same cell types, sPLA2-V is not present in mitochondria, but it has mainly cytosolic and nuclear localization. The enzyme present in isolated rat brain cortex mitochondria is very probably associated with mitoplasts, and it is released as the consequence of a reduction in membrane potential. Rat brain cortex mitochondria contain also a Ca2+-independent PLA2 that seems to be localized on the outer membrane.

Preparation of Escherichia coli-labeled Substrate—Labeled E. coli substrate, generally used for assaying secreted phospholipase A2 (39Jesse R.L. Franson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Elsbach P. Weiss J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. Powell M. Glenney J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1698-1705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was prepared as reported previously (42Nucciarelli F. Gresele P. Nardicchi V. Porcellati S. Macchioni L. Nenci G.G. Goracci G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, bacteria (E. coli; American Type Culture Collection) were grown overnight in triethanolamine medium and resuspended in fresh medium containing [9-10-3H]oleic acid (10.3 Ci/mmol) complexed with 0.02% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). After incubation (3 h at 37 °C), bacteria suspension was autoclaved (20 min at 120 °C and 1 kg/cm2). After washings, labeled E. coli was sedimented by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The specific radioactivity of this substrate (0.7-3 nCi/nmol of phosphatidylethanolamine) was calculated by measuring the radioactivity associated with phosphatidylethanolamine, which represents ≈70% of total phospholipids and contained more than 90% of the incorporated labeled oleic acid. Preparation of Rat Brain Cortex Mitochondria—Mitochondria prepared from rat brain cortex (2-month-old CD rats; Charles River Laboratories) were purified on sucrose gradient as reported previously (43Monni M. Corazzi L. Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and then resuspended in an isotonic medium containing 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.32 m sucrose (S/H buffer). The purity of brain mitochondria was checked by marker assay (44Percy A.K. Moore J.F. Carson M.A. Waechter C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The specific activity of cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondrial marker enzyme) was 5.7 times higher in mitochondria than in homogenate, whereas NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (microsomal marker enzyme), Na+,K+-ATPase (plasma membrane marker), and arylsulfatase A (lysosomal marker) were less than 5% with respect to the homogenate (45Camici O. Corazzi L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 175: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane was in the range 90-93%, as calculated by the latency in cytochrome c oxidase assay (45Camici O. Corazzi L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 175: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In some experiments, mitochondria (2-3 mg of protein/ml of 0.32 m sucrose and 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were incubated with 50 μg of trypsin or Pronase at 30 °C, a concentration known to be ineffective on mitochondrial functional parameters (46Piccotti L. Marchetti C. Migliorati G. Roberti R. Corazzi L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12075-12081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 30 min, aliquots were taken and mitochondria recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Preparation of Mitoplasts—Mitoplasts were prepared as described previously (48Camici O. Corazzi L. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, purified mitochondria were treated with digitonin (0.4 mg/mg of protein) for 30 min at 0 °C and then loaded on sucrose gradient for their separation from intact mitochondria. Cytofluorimetric Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—Cytofluorimetric analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential was done as reported previously (48Camici O. Corazzi L. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, purified mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μm DiOC6(3), in different respiratory conditions. Suspensions were immediately subjected to cytofluorimetric analysis, using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a focused argon laser. For complete depletion of Δψm (positive control), the mitochondria uncoupler CCCP (100 μm) was used. Data were analyzed and stored with the use of a data management system (LYSYS software). DiOC6(3) green fluorescence was plotted on a logarithmic scale versus the frequency of events. The mean value of the integral of fluorescence was also evaluated. Determination of Phospholipase A2Activity Released from Mitochondria—Purified mitochondria were resuspended in S/H buffer (resting state) or, when indicated, in the same buffer containing respiratory substrates or the uncoupler CCCP. The pH of the solutions of ADP, pyruvate, and malate were adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH before additions. In any case, Ca2+ was not added and its concentration in S/H buffer, measured with Fura-2 (acid) (42Nucciarelli F. Gresele P. Nardicchi V. Porcellati S. Macchioni L. Nenci G.G. Goracci G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), was 1 μm. Mitochondria were incubated at 37 °C and then pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Control samples (T0) were prepared in identical conditions, but they were not incubated. A convenient aliquot of the supernatant was taken for PLA2 assay and incubated at 37 °C with [3H]oleate-labeled E. coli (∼30 nCi per sample) in a total volume of 300 μl containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA (fatty acid-free). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 2 n HCl and 150 μl of BSA (20 mg/ml). After a period of 20 min at 4 °C, labeled bacteria were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The radioactivity of the supernatant, containing free [3H]oleic acid, was determined (49Mueller H.W. Pritzker C.R. Kubik A. Deykin D. Thromb. Res. 1993; 72: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The activity of PLA2 was calculated by subtracting blank sample radioactivity from that of samples with extramitochondrial medium. Incubation of Intact Mitochondria or Mitoplasts with Phospholipase-Labeled E. coli Substrate—Labeled E. coli substrate was incubated with purified mitochondria resuspended in S/H buffer (2-3 mg of protein/ml) under the following conditions: A, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 2 mm CaCl2; B, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with 1 mm EGTA. When indicated mitochondria were preincubated with 5 mm DTT or with 30 μm arachidonoyltrifluoromethyl ketone or with 50 μm BEL. Determination of Fumarase Activity—Fumarase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 240 nm. The supernatant (4-10 μg of protein), recovered after the incubation of mitochondria in S/H buffer, was incubated with 0.5 mm malate for 15 min at 25 °C in 0.35 ml of phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) (50Bergmayer H.U. Gawehn K. Grassi M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 1. Verlag Chemie, Weiheim.1974: 452-453Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis of proteins, released from rat brain cortex mitochondria, was performed using monoclonal antibody against rat sPLA2-IIA (generous gift from Dr. H. van den Bosch and Dr. J. Aarsmann, Utrecht) essentially as indicated by van der Helm et al. (51van der Helm H.A. Aarsman A.J. Janssen M.J. Neys F.W. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, mitochondria purified from 10 rat brain cortices were incubated in S/H buffer for 60 min at 37 °C, and the incubation medium was subjected to dialyze against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl at 4 °C overnight (52Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B. Hayes G. McGray P. Chow E.P. Tizard R. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5768-5775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were concentrated and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Blot was analyzed using Duoscan T1200 (AGFA, Seifert, Germany) scanning densitometer and Quantity One 4.4 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Cell Cultures—PC-12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Euro Clone) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 25 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% (v/v) horse serum, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, in a H2O-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were plated on poly(l-lysine)-coated coverglasses (13 mm in diameter) in multiwell plates (4 wells, 3 × 104 cells/well) and cultured for 48 h. U-251 astrocytoma cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), 100units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone in a H2O-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. U-251 cells were plated on glass cover slips (13 mm in diameter) in 4-multiwell plates. Cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cell/well and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PC-12 and U-251 cells, after washings with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), were placed on cover slips and loaded with 500 nm Mito-Tracker Red CM-XRos at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with a mixture of methanol-acetone (1:1 by vol) at -20 °C for 10 min. When indicated, PC-12 cells were fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 7 min, rinsed in PBS, and treated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding of antibodies or antisera was blocked by a preliminary incubation of fixed cells with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS (blocking buffer). This was followed by the incubation at room temperature for 1 h and 30 min with monoclonal antibody against rat sPLA2-IIA diluted 1:10 in blocking buffer or with polyclonal antibody against sPLA2-V (1:100 in blocking buffer). The cells were washed for 20 min in PBS and incubated with rabbit Ig conjugated to Alexa 488 diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS for 20 min, cells were loaded with 10 μm TO-PRO-3, a monomeric cyanine stain for double-stranded DNA giving a blue fluorescence, for 7 min at room temperature. Confocal analysis was performed with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024) using an Ar/Kr laser. The fluorescences of Mito-Tracker and Alexa 488 were detected with excitation wavelengths of 568 and 488, respectively, whereas that of TO-PRO-3 was at 647 nm. Images were elaborated with the colocalization module of Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) on a SGI Octane work station (SGI, Mountain View, CA). Electron Microscopy—U-251 astrocytoma cells were rapidly frozen in a Cryopress device (Med Vac Inc., St. Louis, MO) by impact onto a liquid helium-cooled copper block. Frozen samples were rapidly transferred into a Balzers FSU 010 cryosubstitution unit and treated with: osmium tetroxide in 2% methanol for 8 h at -90 °C, for 8 h at -60 °C, and another 8 h at -30 °C. Osmium tetroxide was then removed by two washings with methanol at -30 °C. After cryosubstitution, samples were embedded in Lowcryl K4M as described by Carlemalm et al. (53Carlemalm E. Villinger W. Hobot J.A. Kellenberger E. J. Microsc. 1985; 140: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cryosections of U-251 cells were treated with sodium metaperiodate for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min in PBS containing 3% BSA and 20 mm NaN3 (buffer A). Next, samples were incubated in buffer A containing 1% normal goat serum and 100 mm glycine for 4 h at room temperature. This step was followed by incubation for 3 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-sPLA2-IIA antibody (1:20 in buffer A + 1% normal goat serum). Sections were washed in buffer A containing 1% Tween 20 (five times, 1 min each) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody labeled with 5-nm gold particles (1:80). Sections were washed in PBS, postfixed for 3 min in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, and counterstained with uranyl acetate. Sections were finally examined by electron microscopy (Philips TEM 208). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance of the data was evaluated by analysis of variance followed by Student's t test or Scheffé's multiple comparison test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Release of Phospholipase A2from Rat Brain Cortex Mitochondria: Time Dependence—A time-dependent and highly significant increase of PLA2 activity was observed in the extramitochondrial medium after incubation of purified mitochondria in S/H buffer, pH 7.4 (Fig. 1). After 60 min, PLA2-specific activity in the medium was nearly 6 times that of nonincubated samples (T0). A further increase was observed after 90 min but a greater variability of the data was noticed. The homogenization of brain cortex in the presence of 100 μg/ml heparin reduced PLA2 activity of the homogenate to 40% of that measured in control samples (homogenate without heparin). Purified mitochondria were then prepared from both homogenates, and the release of sPLA2 was determined as described above. No differences were observed in the specific activity of the enzyme released from mitochondria prepared in the presence or in the absence of heparin, even if the direct addition of this compound to the assay system reduced P"
https://openalex.org/W2060394697,"Cardiac-directed expression of adenylyl cyclase type VI (ACVI) increases stimulated cAMP production, improves heart function, and increases survival in cardiomyopathy. In contrast, pharmacological agents that increase intracellular levels of cAMP have detrimental effects on cardiac function and survival. We wondered whether effects that are independent of cAMP might be responsible for these salutary outcomes associated with ACVI expression. We therefore conducted a series of experiments focused on how gene transcription is influenced by ACVI in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, with a particular focus on genes that might influence cardiac function. We found that overexpression of ACVI down-regulated mRNA and protein expression of phospholamban, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. We determined that the cAMP-responsive-like element in the phospholamban (PLB) promoter was critical for down-regulation by ACVI. Overexpression of ACVI did not alter the expression of CREB, CREM, ATF1, ATF2, or ATF4 proteins. In contrast, overexpression of ACVI increased expression of ATF3 protein, a suppressor of transcription. Following ACVI gene transfer, when cardiac myocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol or NKH477, a water-soluble forskolin analog that directly stimulates AC, expression of ATF3 protein was increased even more, which correlated with reduced expression of PLB. We then showed that ACVI-induced ATF3 protein binds to the cAMP-responsive-like element on the PLB promoter and that overexpression of ATF3 in cardiac myocytes inhibits PLB promoter activity. These findings indicate that ACVI has effects on gene transcription that are not directly dependent on cAMP generation. Cardiac-directed expression of adenylyl cyclase type VI (ACVI) increases stimulated cAMP production, improves heart function, and increases survival in cardiomyopathy. In contrast, pharmacological agents that increase intracellular levels of cAMP have detrimental effects on cardiac function and survival. We wondered whether effects that are independent of cAMP might be responsible for these salutary outcomes associated with ACVI expression. We therefore conducted a series of experiments focused on how gene transcription is influenced by ACVI in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, with a particular focus on genes that might influence cardiac function. We found that overexpression of ACVI down-regulated mRNA and protein expression of phospholamban, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. We determined that the cAMP-responsive-like element in the phospholamban (PLB) promoter was critical for down-regulation by ACVI. Overexpression of ACVI did not alter the expression of CREB, CREM, ATF1, ATF2, or ATF4 proteins. In contrast, overexpression of ACVI increased expression of ATF3 protein, a suppressor of transcription. Following ACVI gene transfer, when cardiac myocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol or NKH477, a water-soluble forskolin analog that directly stimulates AC, expression of ATF3 protein was increased even more, which correlated with reduced expression of PLB. We then showed that ACVI-induced ATF3 protein binds to the cAMP-responsive-like element on the PLB promoter and that overexpression of ATF3 in cardiac myocytes inhibits PLB promoter activity. These findings indicate that ACVI has effects on gene transcription that are not directly dependent on cAMP generation.

Previous studies showed that the amount of AC sets a limit on the ability of cardiac myocytes to generate cAMP (1Gao M.H. Ping P. Post S. Insel P.A. Tang R. Hammond H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and cardiac-directed expression of AC type VI (ACVI) has pronounced favorable effects on cardiovascular function in normal and failing hearts (2Gao M.H.

The most direct explanation is that the benefits stem from increased intracellular levels of cAMP; this explanation is contrary to current dogma in heart failure which asserts that inotropic agents that increase cAMP are bad for the heart. Indeed, pharmacological agents that stimulate the β-adrenergic receptor or decrease the breakdown of cAMP increase cardiac function but do not appear to prolong life (7Krell M.J. Kline E.M.

In contrast, ACVI, a dominant AC isoform in mammalian cardiac myocytes, improves global cardiac function, attenuates myocardial hypertrophy, and increases survival in murine cardiomyopathy (3Roth D.M.

However, when cardiac-directed β-adrenergic receptor expression is used to treat this same model, life is shortened (10Dorn II, G.W. Tepe N.M. Lorenz J.N. Koch W.J. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6400-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), underscoring the marked differences evoked by these signaling elements, both of which are associated with increased intracellular cAMP.Because of the disparate results between β-adrenergic receptor and AC expression in heart failure, we postulated that the salutary effects of AC expression may depend on mechanisms not directly linked with cAMP production per se. A suitable initial approach, we reasoned, would be to determine whether ACVI gene transfer (independently of cAMP generation) alters transcription of genes important in contractile function.To investigate cAMP-independent events in cardiac myocytes, we focused on how ACVI affects transcriptional regulation and to what extent that effect is different from the effect evoked by agents that directly stimulate cAMP production. We found that ACVI, in the absence of β-adrenergic receptor or AC stimulation, down-regulated the expression of genes containing the cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Specifically, phospholamban (PLB), an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, was down-regulated by ACVI gene transfer, a result of increased expression of activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3), a transcriptional suppressor in the CRE-binding protein (CREB)/ATF family (11Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, direct stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol or of AC with NKH477 increased PLB expression and did not alter expression of ATF3 protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDetection of Gene Expression Using GeneArray System—The “mouse cAMP/Ca2+ signaling pathway finder” membrane was purchased from SuperArray Inc. (Frederick, MD). Among the 96 genes spotted on the membrane, 52 of them contained CRE or CRE-like elements, and others contained elements that respond to calcium. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes from the following four experimental conditions were used in these experiments: uninfected; uninfected but stimulated with the forskolin analog NKH477 (10 μm); infected with adenovirus encoding ACVI (Ad.ACVI) at 600 virus particles (vp) per cell; and adenovirus encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad.EGFP) at 600 vp/cell. Five micrograms of total RNA extracted from the cardiac myocytes from each condition was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The radioactive labeled cDNA probes were hybridized to the genes spotted on the GeneArray membrane.Cloning of PLB Promoter and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The PLB promoter fragment from -156 to +64 bp (12McTiernan C.F. Lemster B.H. Frye C.S. Johns D.C. Feldman A.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2137-2153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was cloned from rat DNA by PCR. The primers used in the PCR contain restriction enzyme sites NheI and XhoI at each end and the following sequences: PLBF, 5′-CTAGCTAGCTGAAGCACAACATGTTACCG-3′; PLBR, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGTTGTGTGAAGTCTGGG-3′. The PCR was performed using a kit containing Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The PCR product was subcloned into PCR 4 blunt-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The PLB promoter fragment was released from the TOPO vector by NheI and XhoI digestion and subcloned into pGL-3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) in front of the luciferase gene to obtain the pPLB-luc reporter plasmid. To mutate the CRE-like site in the PLB promoter, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quick-change kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The primers used for mutating the CRE-like element were 5′-p-GTTGGGATTCCTATGGACCATAGTAAGACCTCCCTAGAATG-3′ and 5′-p-CATTCTAGGGAGGTCTTACTATGGTCCATAGGAATCCCAACC-3′.Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocyte Isolation, Gene Transfer, and Stimulation—Cardiac myocytes from neonatal rats were isolated (1Gao M.H. Ping P. Post S. Insel P.A. Tang R. Hammond H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were infected 1 day after attachment to the plate with recombinant adenovirus (600 vp/cell) encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) or ACVI with an AU1 tag (six amino acids, DTYRYI, derived from bovine papilloma virus-1) at the C terminus of the ACVI for protein detection. Stimulation with isoproterenol (10 μm) or NKH477 (10 μm) was performed 1 day after virus infection for 10 min (for change in phosphorylation) or 20 h (for gene expression).Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfection of cardiac myocytes was performed using GeneShuttle-40 reagent (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA). DNA and Geneshuttle-40 were diluted separately in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, and a 1:6 ratio of DNA to lipid was used. The diluted DNA and lipid were combined and incubated (23 °C, 30 min), and the mixture was transferred onto cultured cardiac myocytes. The luciferase assay was performed 48 h after transfection.Luciferase activity of the reporter co-transfected with control plasmid was defined as 100%. In the experiments whose results are displayed in Fig. 3 and Fig. 7, the control plasmids (pAd and pCG) carrying the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters were included to ensure that each transfection mixture contained the same amount of CMV promoter.Fig. 7ATF3 inhibits transcription of the PLB promoter through a CRE-like site. The normal PLB promoter or a mutant PLB promoter (mPLB) was linked to a luciferase reporter and co-transfected with pCGATF3 (ATF3) or pCG (Con) into cardiac myocytes. ATF3 had a suppressive effect on minimal PLB promoter activity. Mutation of the CRE-like element in the mini-PLB promoter was associated with loss of PLB promoter activity, and the suppressive effect of ATF3 was diminished.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunofluorescence Staining—Cardiac myocytes were fixed with 10% formalin solution containing 4% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 min at 23 °C. Fixed cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were blocked with normal rabbit serum for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies including anti-AU1 (Babco, Berkeley, CA) for detection of ACVI at 1:1000 dilution, and anti-ATF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:50 dilution for 1 h at 23 °C. The cells were washed four times with PBS and then incubated for another hour with a secondary antibody that was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine. Stained cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy.Western Blot and Northern Blot Analysis—Western blotting of cardiac myocyte extracts was performed according to the protocol developed by Hagiwara et al. (13Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The CREB/ATF family proteins were detected using individual antiserum or phosphoserine 133-specific CREB antiserum. PLB protein was detected using a monoclonal anti-PLB antibody (ABR Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) at a dilution of 1:500. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (1Gao M.H. Ping P. Post S. Insel P.A. Tang R. Hammond H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA obtained from cells from each condition was separated on a 1% agarose gel; PLB-specific mRNA was detected by using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled PLB probe that contained rat PLB cDNA.Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (14Gao M.H. Morgan I. Vogt P.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4229-4235PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were washed in PBS, and the cell pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors mixture tablets (1 tablet dissolved in 50 ml of buffer A) (Roche Applied Science). They were homogenized 3-4 times on ice in a glass homogenizer by 10 strokes with pestle B. The homogenates were transferred into tubes and centrifuged in a Microfuge at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The nuclei pellets were washed once by adding buffer A without Nonidet P-40 and collected as above. Nuclei were lysed by adding buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture. Nuclei were homogenized as above, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged in a Microfuge at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored in small aliquots at -80 °C.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—This assay was performed as described previously (14Gao M.H. Morgan I. Vogt P.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4229-4235PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides (oligos) used as probes in EMSA contained the following sequences: plbCRE, 5′-GATTCCTATGTGATGTCATAAGACCT-3′; and plbCREm, 5′-GATTCCTATGGACCATAGTAAGACCT-3′. Double-stranded oligos were labeled by filling in the 3′-end C of the complementary strand with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the DECA-prime II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with the radioactive labeled probe (105 cpm) and 1 μg of poly-(dI-dC) in binding buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for overnight at 4 °C. The mixtures were then loaded onto 4% native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE buffer (6 h, 23 °C). The gel was transferred onto Whatman No. 3MM paper, wrapped in a seal wrap, and exposed to an x-ray film at -80 °C. Competition with unlabeled oligos was performed by incubating cold oligos with nuclear extracts for 10 min before adding the probe. Supershifts with antibodies were performed by either incubating nuclear extracts with antibody overnight before adding the probe or by incubating nuclear extracts with the probe overnight and then adding antibodies for 30-60 min.Statistics—Data are reported as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Comparisons between two group means were made by using Student's t test for unpaired data (two-tailed). Multiple group comparisons were conducted using ANOVA, and post hoc testing was conducted (only when overall p < 0.05) by Student's t test for unpaired data (two-tailed), with Bonferonni correction for multiple tests. The null hypothesis was rejected when p < 0.05.RESULTSRegulation of Transcription by ACVIGene Transfer Versus Pharmacological Stimulation of AC—To determine whether overexpression of ACVIversus pharmacological stimulation of AC affected endogenous gene expression differently in cardiac myocytes, we used gene transcript profiling. The results of this initial screen of selected genes indicated that ACVI gene transfer was associated with reduced expression of PLB, β1-adrenergic receptor, and atrial natriuretic factor. In contrast, expression of these genes was increased by direct AC stimulation with NKH477 (Fig. 1).Fig. 1ACVI gene transfer versus AC stimulation on mRNA expression, initial screen. Total RNA from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The radioactive labeled probes were used to hybridize with the cDNA on GeneArray membranes (the cAMP/Ca2+ pathway finder, see “Experimental Procedures”). This initial screen suggested that PLB expression was reduced by ACVI gene transfer but increased by pharmacological stimulation of AC. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) expression also appeared to be increased by AC stimulation but decreased by ACVI gene transfer. Control, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes alone; Ad.EGFP, after infection with adenovirus encoding EGFP; Ad.ACVI, after infection with adenovirus encoding ACVI; NKH, after incubation with NKH447 (10 μm), a water-soluble forskolin analog that directly stimulates adenylyl cyclase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ACVIReduces PLB Expression—To confirm the findings obtained from the gene transcript profiling experiments, we selected PLB for further studies. We analyzed PLB expression by Northern blotting and found that PLB mRNA was reduced by ACVI gene transfer into cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2A) and that stimulation with NKH477 was associated with further reduction in PLB mRNA (Fig. 2B). Gene transfer of an AC that lacks the transmembrane domain had no effect, suggesting that the effects on PLB were ACVI-specific. Reduced PLB expression by ACVI gene transfer was viral dose-related; increased vp/cell ratio was associated with a greater reduction in PLB mRNA (Fig. 2A). In addition to reduced PLB mRNA, PLB protein was also reduced by overexpression of ACVI (Fig. 2C). In contrast, NKH477 increased PLB mRNA expression (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2ACVI reduces PLB expression. A, PLB mRNA was reduced by overexpression of ACVI. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were infected with different amounts of adenovirus encoding ACVI or EGFP. Twenty micrograms of total RNA isolated from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes was loaded in each lane and hybridized with PLB cDNA probe. B, PLB mRNA was down-regulated by overexpression of ACVI but increased by AC stimulation with NKH447. All adenoviruses were used at 600 vp/cell. NKH477 (10 μm) was added 20 h after gene transfer. Ad.mAC, a mutant form of AC that lacks the transmembrane domain, had no effect, suggesting that the effects on PLB were ACVI-specific. ACVI, Ad.ACVI; GFP, Ad.EGFP; Mini AC, Ad.mAC. C, PLB protein expression was reduced by ACVI. Twenty micrograms of protein from lysates of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE. PLB protein was detected using an anti-PLB antibody. Lane 1, Ad.EGFP; lane 2, Ad.ACVI; lane 3, isoproterenol (10 μm); lane 4, NKH477 (10 μm); lane 5, Ad.ACVI and isoproterenol; lane 6, Ad.EGFP and isoproterenol; lane 7, Ad.ACVI and NKH477; and lane 8, Ad.EGFP and NKH477. Results indicate that ACVI gene transfer is associated with reduced PLB protein content (lane 2 versus lane 1). Ad.ACVI plus isoproterenol was associated with a greater reduction of PLB protein (lane 5 versus lanes 3 and 6). Ad.ACVI plus NKH477 stimulation also leads to marked down-regulation of PLB protein (lane 7 versus lanes 4 and 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ACVIReduces Transcription through CRE or CRE-like Element—The rat minimal PLB promoter activity resides in a fragment from -159 to +64 bp (12McTiernan C.F. Lemster B.H. Frye C.S. Johns D.C. Feldman A.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2137-2153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although there is no consensus CRE element (TGACGTCA) in that region, there is a CRE-like element TGATGTCA located at -58 bp in the PLB promoter. By using a luciferase reporter assay system, we studied the effect of ACVI on the activity of the PLB promoter. In a transient transfection assay, the minimal PLB promoter fragment showed relatively high activity when co-transfected with the pAd vector carrying the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. However, co-transfection of the reporter with pAd.ACVI reduced its activity (p = 0.024) (Fig. 3A). To determine the importance of the CRE-like element, the CRE-like site was mutated into GACCATAG (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) through site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant promoter fragment was linked to the luciferase reporter gene and used in transient transfection assays as above. Mutation of CRE-like element was associated with marked reduction of basal PLB activity, and the suppressive effect of ACVI on the promoter was absent (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the CRE-like element in the PLB promoter plays an important role in down-regulation of PLB by ACVI.In contrast to the inhibitory effect of pAd.ACVI on reporter activity (Fig. 3A), co-transfection of the reporter with a CREB expression plasmid (pcDNA3flagCREB; a gift from Dr. Marc Montminy, Salk Research Institute) had no effect (Fig. 3B). NKH477 stimulation of cardiac myocytes transfected with the PLB promoter-luciferase reporter construct did not affect minimal PLB promoter activity, even in the presence of CREB (Fig. 3B). Statistical analysis (3 × 2 ANOVA) showed that for each of the constructs there was no increase in activity with NKH477 stimulation. There were also no differences in activity between control and CREB (basal or stimulated). In contrast, the ACVI expression vector showed marked reduction in basal (p < 0.01) and stimulated (p < 0.01) activities compared with the control construct. Finally, the ACVI expression vector showed marked reduction in basal (p < 0.01) and stimulated (p < 0.01) activities compared with CREB as well.NKH477 stimulation of cardiac myocytes transfected with the somatostatin promoter-luciferase reporter construct (a gift from Dr. Marc Montminy, Salk Research Institute) significantly activated somatostatin promoter activity (p < 0.019) (Fig. 3C), which may have resulted from activated CREB that bound to the consensus CRE site (TGACGTCA) in this promoter. Our results suggest that the suppressive effect of ACVI is mediated through the CRE-like element in the PLB promoter, but activation of endogenous PLB transcription by NKH477 is not mediated through the CRE-like element in the minimal PLB promoter.Overexpression of ACVIIncreases ATF3 Expression—To determine the mechanism by which ACVI down-regulates PLB expression, we measured the expression of transcription factors in the CREB/ATF families in response to ACVI gene transfer. We found that Ad.ACVI (600 vp/cell) did not alter the expression of CREB, CREM, ATF1, ATF2, and ATF4 proteins. However, the expression of ATF3 was increased (Fig. 4A, 1st and 2nd lanes versus 5th lane). Following ACVI gene transfer, ATF3 protein expression was further increased by isoproterenol or NKH477 stimulation (Fig. 4A, 6th and 7th lanes; Fig. 4B), which correlated with a further reduction in PLB expression (Fig. 2C). ATF3 expression was maximal at 600 vp/cell (Fig. 4B). In contrast, stimulation of Ad.EGFP-infected cardiac myocytes with isoproterenol or NKH477 had no effect on ATF3 expression (Fig. 4A, 1st and 2nd lanes versus 3rd and 4th lanes). Phosphorylation of CREB was mildly increased by ACVI gene transfer (Fig. 4A, 5th lane) but increased to a much greater degree upon stimulation with isoproterenol or NKH447 (6th and 7th lanes).Fig. 4Western blot analysis of CREB/ATF family proteins. A, total cell lysates were harvested in 1× SDS sample buffer after infection with Ad.EGFP or Ad.ACVI (600 vp/cell) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Expression of protein was detected using specific antibody to each member of the CREB/ATF family. Con, untreated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes; -, no additional treatment; Iso, isoproterenol (10 μm); NKH, NKH447 (10 μm). ATF3 protein expression was increased by ACVI gene transfer.

After the first 24-h period, cardiac myocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μm) or NKH477 (10 μm) for 20 h.

We detected nuclear presence of ATF3 following Ad.ACVI gene transfer but much less in uninfected cells (Fig. 5).Fig. 5ATF3 protein located in the nuclei of myocytes after ACVI gene transfer. Immunofluorescence staining with the anti-AU1 antibody for the expression of ACVI (green) and anti-ATF3 antibody (red) showed membrane staining of ACVI and nuclear localization of ATF3 in Ad.ACVI virus-infected myocytes (top panel), and very little ACVI or ATF3 in uninfected myocytes (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Effects of ACVIGene Transfer on PLB Expression Involve ATF3—Our results suggest that ACVI gene transfer reduces PLB gene expression via increased expression of ATF3. To confirm this, using EMSA analysis we examined whether ATF3 binds to a CRE-like motif derived from the PLB promoter. Upon incubation of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled oligos containing the CRE-like motif with nuclear extracts from Ad.ACVI-infected cardiac myocytes, multiple DNA-protein complexes were formed (Fig. 6, lane 1). A subset of these complexes was found to supershift when an anti-ATF3 antibody was added to the mixture after complexes had formed (Fig. 6, lane 2). A shift was also seen when the anti-ATF3 antibody was incubated (overnight) with the nuclear extract prior to adding the labeled probe (Fig. 6, lane 4). On the other hand, we did not detect supershifted bands after adding an anti-CREM antibody (a gift from Dr. Marc Montminy, Salk Research Institute) under these same conditions (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 5). CREM can act as either a transcriptional activator or suppressor by interacting with CRE or CRE-like element. A transcriptional suppressor of CREM was identified in cardiac myocytes (15Muller F.U.

https://openalex.org/W2163564560,"Previously we reported that AMAP2/PAG3/Papα/KIAA0400, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), acts to antagonize Arf6 function when overexpressed, whereas it was shown to exhibit efficient GAP activities for other Arf isoforms in vitro. Here, we found that AMAP2, through its ArfGAP domain, binds to GTP-Arf6 but not to GDP-Arf6 or other Arfs irrespective of nucleotide status. The majority of AMAP2 was localized to intracellular tubulovesicular structures and redistributed to Arf6-enriched membrane areas upon Arf6 activation. In HeLa cells, Arf6 has been shown to be involved in the clathrin-independent endocytosis of Tac, but not the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of transferrin. We found that Arf6 silencing inhibited the internalization of Tac, but not transferrin, in HeLa cells. Internalization of Tac, but not transferrin, was also significantly inhibited by AMAP2 silencing and overexpression. AMAP2 was moreover found to bind to amphiphysin IIm, a component of the endocytic machinery, via its proline-rich domain. We propose that AMAP2 has dual mechanisms for its function; it exhibits efficient catalytic GAP activity for the class I and II Arfs and yet is involved in the cellular function of the class III Arf without immediate GAP activity. These dual mechanisms of AMAP2 may be important for the cellular function of GTP-Arf6. Previously we reported that AMAP2/PAG3/Papα/KIAA0400, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), acts to antagonize Arf6 function when overexpressed, whereas it was shown to exhibit efficient GAP activities for other Arf isoforms in vitro.

We found that Arf6 silencing inhibited the internalization of Tac, but not transferrin, in HeLa cells. Internalization of Tac, but not transferrin, was also significantly inhibited by AMAP2 silencing and overexpression. AMAP2 was moreover found to bind to amphiphysin IIm, a component of the endocytic machinery, via its proline-rich domain. We propose that AMAP2 has dual mechanisms for its function; it exhibits efficient catalytic GAP activity for the class I and II Arfs and yet is involved in the cellular function of the class III Arf without immediate GAP activity. These dual mechanisms of AMAP2 may be important for the cellular function of GTP-Arf6. Arfs belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and play essential roles in intracellular membrane/vesicle trafficking (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Roth M.G. Hall A. GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 176-197Google Scholar). The family includes six isoforms of Arf and several Arf-like proteins in mammalian tissues. Arfs are subclassified into three classes by their structural similarities: class I (Arf1 to -3), class II (Arf4 and -5), and class III (Arf6). Arf1 primarily functions at perinuclear areas, mediating transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi by employing coat protein complexes, such as COP I (2Roth M.G. Hall A. GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 176-197Google Scholar). On the other hand, Arf6 primarily functions at the cell periphery, mediating membrane and cell surface receptor endocytosis and recycling (3D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The function of the class II Arfs is largely unknown. The structure and function of Arfs are significantly different from other members of the Ras superfamily GTPases. Arfs do not exhibit detectable intrinsic GTPase activity (10Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), unlike the other GTPases. Moreover, the binding sites for the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; PRD, proline-rich domain; Tfn, transferrin; SH3, Src homology 3; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; PRD, proline-rich domain; Tfn, transferrin; SH3, Src homology 3; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and coatomers (effectors) do not overlap in Arf1, whereas the GAP binding domain and the effector binding domain largely overlap in the other GTPases such as Ras (11Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Similarly, the primary structures of the GAP domain of ArfGAPs are significantly different from those of GAPs for other Ras-superfamily GTPases: the ArfGAP domains primarily consist of a zinc finger structure, which is not present in the other GAPs. The GTPase activity of other GTPases, such as Ras and Rho, is accelerated dramatically upon binding to their cognate GAPs. In contrast, ArfGAPs are found as components of GTP-Arf1-mediated priming complexes in the COP I system (12Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 13Majoul I. Straub M. Hell S.W. Duden R. Söling H.-D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that GTP-Arf1 may act to recruit ArfGAP to the donor membrane during GTPArf1-mediated priming complex formation (11Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Roth M.G. Cell. 1999; 97: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Springer S. Spang A. Schekman R. Cell. 1999; 97: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that some ArfGAPs can stay associated with the GTP-bound form of Arf at least for a while. In the case of the other small GTPases, the “arginine finger” model has been proposed, in which the corresponding GAP molecule supplies the critical arginine, which hydrogen-bonds to the γ-phosphate of GTP bound to the GTPase and mediates the transition state (16Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are two contradictory models proposed for the Arf-ArfGAP complex. Goldberg has proposed that Arf1-ArfGAP1 constitutes only part of the usual protein binding interface and that the key residue(s) required for maximal rates of the GTP hydrolysis, like the “arginine finger,” may not be provided by ArfGAP1, but further association of the coatomer with the Arf1-ArfGAP1 complex may be required for the maximal GTP hydrolysis activity (11Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast, structural analysis of Papβ suggests that the critical residues for hydrolysis of GTP bound to Arf1 may actually be provided by this ArfGAP molecule (17Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model is consistent with a result that Papβ exhibits efficient catalytic GAP activity for GTP-Arf1 in vitro (18Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that there are several reports contradictory to Goldberg's model, suggesting that the coatomer may simply aid the productive association of Arf1 and ArfGAP1 (17Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Eugster A. Frigerio G. Dale M. Duden R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a study on the interface array of protein interactions of the small GTPases indicates that the protein-protein contacts in the Arf1-ArfGAP1 complex are significantly different from those found in other GAP and small GTPase complexes (21Corbett K.D. Alber T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 710-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PAG3/Papα/KIAA0400 (referred to here as AMAP2) functions to antagonize Arf6 activity, which was determined by several different in vivo assay systems (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Uchida H. Kondo A. Yoshimura Y. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), including Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis in which the activity of Arf6, but not the other Arf isoforms, is essential (24Zhang Q. Cox D. Tseng C.C. Donaldson J.G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19977-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, a biochemical assay revealed that AMAP2 exhibits phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent catalytic GAP activity for Arf1 (class I) and Arf5 (class II) but much less activity for Arf6 (class III) (18Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). DEF-1/ASAP1, a close isoform of AMAP2, has also been shown to exhibit GAP activity for Arf1, but not Arf6, in vivo, which was assessed by measuring cellular levels of GTP-loaded Arfs in DEF-1/ASAP1-overexpressing cells (25Furman C. Short S.M. Subramanian R.R. Zetter B.R. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). AMAP2 has several protein interaction motifs other than the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, to which Pyk2 and paxillin have been reported to bind (18Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this report, to further assess the isoform specificity and understand the mechanism of how AMAP2 is involved in cellular functions of Arfs, we identified other binding proteins to AMAP2. Consistent with our previous reports (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Uchida H. Kondo A. Yoshimura Y. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), our results described here again implicated AMAP2 in Arf6 function. Our results indicate that AMAP2 may function as an effector for Arf6 by stably binding to GTP-Arf6 rather than simply acting as its catalytic GAP enzyme. Such binding of AMAP2 to activated Arf6 may participate in priming complex formation required for Arf6-mediated endocytosis. cDNAs—cDNAs for AMAP2 (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), APAP2/Git2 (26Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Okawa K. Tsubouchi A. Nakamura K. Yagi R. Yano H. Kondo A.

Yodoi J. Honjo T. Nature. 1984; 311: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) have been described previously. cDNAs for amphiphysin IIm, and Arfs and their mutants were gifts from A. Aderem and K. Nakayama, respectively. Dynamin-2 cDNA (the ba isoform) (28Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) was cloned from human fetal brain first strand cDNAs (Clontech), using appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides coupled with a PCR amplification. Mutant cDNAs of AMAP2 (2M, P785A/P788A/R790A; 8M, P932A/R937A/K938A; and ΔArfGAP, deletion of amino acids 421-541) and dynamin-2 (K44A) were made using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Arf cDNAs were tagged in frame with hemagglutinin (HA) tag at their C termini. Other cDNAs were ligated in frame to the C terminus of tag sequences, as indicated. For mammalian expression, cDNAs were ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1 His (Invitrogen), pEBG (29Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), as indicated. pGEX-GGA3 VHS-GAT encoding the VHS and GAT domains (amino acids 1-313) of GGA3 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was a gift from P. Randazzo. cDNAs for the AMAP2 ArfGAP domain (amino acids 421-541), and the amphiphysin II SH3 domain (amino acids 494-588) were each ligated into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) to be fused in frame to the C terminus of GST. GST-tagged recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-beads, as described previously (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells and Transfection—HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). 5 × 105 cells in a 100-mm culture dish were transfected with 4 μg of cDNA using PolyFect (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and incubated for 24 h prior to analysis, unless otherwise indicated. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A DNA fragment of the AMAP2 proline-rich domain (PRD) (amino acids 744-1220) was cloned into pBTM116. A HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) was screened using this fragment as a bait in a two-hybrid system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 as a host, as previously described (30Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-AMAP2 and anti-APAP2 antibodies have been described previously (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Okawa K. Tsubouchi A. Nakamura K. Yagi R. Yano H. Kondo A. Iwamatsu A. Mizoguchi A. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 645-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Xpress tag, HA tag, GST, green fluorescent protein (GFP), Tac, and amphiphysin II were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal anti-Arf6 antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse IgG1 (MOPC 21) was from Sigma. Rat monoclonal anti-amphiphysin IIm antibody was a gift from A. Aderem. Donkey antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG or rat IgM, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5, were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Protein Binding and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 μg/ml pepstatin A) unless otherwise described. Protein binding assays were performed by precipitating GST fusion proteins using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was done using 2 mg of cell lysate and the appropriate antibodies bound to Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), as described (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Proteins retained on the beads were subjected to immunoblotting analysis after separation by SDS-PAGE and detected by an enzyme-linked chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). 20 μg of total cell lysates were included when necessary. Guanine Nucleotide Status of Arf6—The guanine nucleotide binding status of Arf6 bound to the AMAP2 ArfGAP domain was analyzed using a similar method as described previously (25Furman C. Short S.M. Subramanian R.R. Zetter B.R. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Fronman M.A. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 COS-7 cells in a 100-mm dish were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA-Arf6-HA. Twenty-four h later, cells were washed and radiolabeled with 325 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h. Cell lysates were then prepared using a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% cholate, 0.005% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and incubated with 5 μg each of GST-ArfGAP or GST alone, coupled to glutathione-beads, for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads four times with the above buffer, the radioactive substance retained on the beads was eluted with 2 m formic acid at 70 °C for 3 min and subjected to thin layer chromatography using polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck). As a control, Arf6-HA was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody and analyzed similarly. Peptide Binding—Proline-rich peptides were synthesized on derivatized cellulose membranes using the SPOTs KIT (Genosys) according to the manufacturer's instructions and examined for their binding to GST-amphiphysin II SH3 using a method previously described (32Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). After blocking, membranes were hybridized with 0.1 μg/ml of 32P-labeled GST proteins at 4 °C overnight and then washed three times with Hyb 75 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) (32Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Radioactivities retained on filters were measured using FLA-2000 and its attached software, MacBAS, version 2.5 (Fujifilm). Phosphorylation of the GST-amphiphysin II SH3 or GST (a product of pGEX-2TK) was performed using the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific radioactivity of the probes was about 5 × 106 cpm/μg. Microscopy—Subcellular localization of proteins were analyzed by fixing cells in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and being permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, as previously described (22Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated, using laser confocal microscopy (LSM 510, version 2.5; Carl Zeiss) or fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss). Each figure shows representative results that were observed in a majority of the transfected cells (more than 80%) in at least three independent experiments (more than 50 cells examined). Quantification of protein colocalization was done on unprocessed images using Metamorph Imaging System Software (version 4.6; Universal Imaging), as described previously (33Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47590-47598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, the average grayscale pixel intensity of the nucleus region was measured in the AMAP2, amphiphysin IIm, and Arf channels and defined as background. To subtract background, the threshold of each channel was set at the value obtained for background. The average pixel intensity was measured for the thresholded images, and the threshold was then set at this new value. The percentage of area of overlap between AMAP2 pixels over amphiphysin IIm or Arf pixels or Arf pixels over amphiphysin IIm pixels was calculated. Ten randomly selected cells were examined in each assay. Immunoelectron microscopy was carried out using the silver enhancement technique as described previously (26Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Okawa K. Tsubouchi A. Nakamura K. Yagi R. Yano H. Kondo A. Iwamatsu A. Mizoguchi A. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 645-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Briefly, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 4 h, rinsed once with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and blocked with 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% saponin overnight, followed by a wash with 0.005% saponin in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled with 1.4-nm gold particles (Nanoprobes) for 3 h. After washing, gold particles were enhanced by incubation with silver developer (Nanoprobes). The sections were postfixed with 0.5% OsO4, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Wpon. Ultrathin sections were then made and analyzed using an electron microscope (JEM-1010; JEOL). Representative results are shown from more than 10 sections examined. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Interference—siRNA duplexes were chemically synthesized and purified by Japan Bio Services. Oligonucleotides used for human Arf6 siRNA were (5′-GCACCGCAUUAUCAAUGACCGUU-3′ and 5′-CGGUCAUUGAUAAUGCGGUGCUU-3′), for human AMAP2 siRNA (5′-UUUAGGAAGUGCGUUCCUGAAUU-3′ and 5′-UUCAGGAACGCACUUCCUAAAUU-3′), for human APAP2 siRNA (5′-AACUGCCCACUUCGUUGCUUGUU-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAACGAAGUGGGCAGUUUU-3′). These nucleotide sequences were not homologous to any other human genome sequences in the NCBI data base. As a negative control, an oligonucleotide duplex with a similar length but an irrelevant sequence (5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGCGAAACAUCCUAAGC-3′) was purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected with 50 nm siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 36 h prior to analysis. Endocytosis—Internalization of Tac molecules expressed in HeLa cells by cDNA transfection was measured using an anti-Tac antibody, as described previously (36Donaldson J.G. Radhakrishna H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 × 105 cells in a 35-mm dish, transfected with cDNAs or siRNA duplexes, were incubated with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-Tac antibody (clone 7G7) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and then incubated with the same medium for 30 min at 37 °C. To remove Tac antibodies remaining on the cell surface, cells were incubated with a low pH solution (0.5 m NaCl and 0.5% acetic acid, pH 3.0) at an ambient temperature for 15 s and rinsed once with the medium before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, and labeled using Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies to detect internalized Tac antibodies. Internalization of transferrin (Tfn) was measured according to a method described previously (37Wigge P. Vallis Y. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), using biotinylated human Tfn (Sigma). Briefly, 0.4 × 105 cells in a 35-mm dish, transfected with cDNAs or siRNA duplexes, were washed twice with DMEM, incubated with DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated with 25 μg/ml Tfn for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. After washing three times with DMEM at an ambient temperature to reduce surface and nonspecific labeling, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with Cy5-conjugated streptavidin to detect internalized biotinylated Tfn. Amounts of internalized Tac or Tfn molecules were evaluated by quantifying the intensities of the fluorescent signals using computer software associated with the confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510 version 2.5). Transfection-positive cells were identified by immunolabeling of transfected proteins by their tags or by the autofluorescence from co-transfected enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Endocytosis blocked cells were defined as transfected cells in which Tac or Tfn uptake was less than 20% of that seen in untransfected cells in the same fields, as described previously (38Owen D.J.

Results are shown as means ± S.E. in three independent experiments (more than 50 cells were examined in each experiment). AMAP2 Binds to GTP-Arf6 via Its ArfGAP Domain—It has been shown by protein pull-down assays that guanine nucleotide exchange factor domains can selectively and stably bind to their specific substrate GTPases in the GDP-bound forms (39Hart M.J.

As one of the possible ways to assess the isoform specificity of ArfGAPs, we examined whether the ArfGAP domain of AMAP2 binds stably to Arf. For this, we prepared purified the GST fusion form of the AMAP2 ArfGAP domain (GST-ArfGAP) on glutathione-beads and incubated them with COS-7 cell lysates, expressing HA-tagged Arf proteins by cDNA transfection. We used Arf1, Arf5, and Arf6 as representing each class of Arfs. As shown in Fig. 1A, GST-ArfGAP pulled down the GTP hydrolysis-deficient mutant of Arf6, Arf6Q67L, but only marginally the GTP binding-deficient mutant, Arf6T27N, and wild type Arf6. Pull-down of the other classes of Arfs was marginal, irrespective of their nucleotide binding status (Fig. 1A). As a control, we used the GST fusion form of the VHS-GAT domain of GGA3 (GST-GGA3), which is known to bind to GTP-bound Arfs (41Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This protein pulled down all of the Arf isoforms bound to GTP, Arf1Q71L, Arf5Q71L, and Arf6Q67L (Fig. 1B). We also examined whether GST-ArfGAP can pull down wild-type Arf6 bound to GTP. For this, COS-7 cells overexpressing HA-tagged wild type Arf6 was radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the cell lysate was incubated with GSTArfGAP bound to beads. Thin layer chromatography indicated the preferential existence of GTP, but not GDP, in the pulled down fraction of GST-ArfGAP, despite the fact that most of the wild type Arf6-HA, immunoprecipitated by an anti-HA antibody, binds to GDP rather than GTP in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1C). We then examined possible binding of full-length AMAP2 with wild type Arfs in vivo. To do this, GST-tagged full-length wild type AMAP2 (GST-AMAP2) was co-overexpressed with HA-tagged wild type Arf in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, GST-AMAP2 selectively and efficiently pulled down Arf6, but not the other Arfs. The same result w"

Recent studies have implicated the ligands CCL19 and CCL21 and their receptor, CCR7, in the specific migration of naïve lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells to secondary lymphoid organs during immune homeostasis. However, the role that these molecules play during immune priming is not well understood. In this study, using CCL19(8–83), a novel N-terminal truncation mutant, we have investigated the role of CCL19 in a primary allogeneic immune response, a response of particular relevance to transplant rejection. This antagonist specifically inhibited wild type CCL19-induced chemotaxis and intracellular calcium mobilization without affecting that of CCL21. The treatment of mice with CCL19(8–83) did not globally inhibit the recruitment of cells into lymph nodes; however, it inhibited the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes toward allogeneic dendritic cells. This is the first evidence that CCL19 plays a role in immune priming.

This is the first evidence that CCL19 plays a role in immune priming. The rapid initiation of a primary antigen-specific T cell immune response is dependent on the coordinated and efficient interaction between antigen presenting DCs 1The abbreviations used are: DC, dendritic cell; plt, paucity of lymph node t cell; mu, murine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; tsDC, temperature-sensitive dendritic cell; alloDC, allogeneic dendritic cell; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; LMCV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; VV, vaccinia virus. and naive T cells. This process is promoted by colocalization of these cells in specific microenvironments within secondary (2°) lymphoid tissues. Following antigen-specific activation, effector lymphocytes must also be guided to the site of infection. Members of the chemokine gene superfamily play a critical role in these processes (1Kim C.H. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Forster R. Schubel A. Breitfeld D. Kremmer E. Renner-Muller I. Wolf E. Lipp M. Cell. 1999; 99: 23-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Chemokines can be classified into two groups based on expression and function: 1) inflammatory/inducible and 2) homeostatic/constitutive (3Gale L.M. McColl S.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar, 5Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat.

Today. 1998; 19: 568-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In general, inflammatory chemokine expression is induced at peripheral sites in response to inflammatory stimuli where they regulate recruitment of effector leukocytes into the tissue. In contrast, homeostatic chemokines are constitutively expressed within lymphoid organs where they regulate lymphocyte and DC trafficking. In particular, they are involved in maintaining homeostatic trafficking and positioning of cells both within 2° lymphoid organs and in the peripheral tissues for antigen sampling and immune surveillance (5Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 7Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Two chemokines of particular importance in lymphocyte and DC trafficking are the homeostatic chemokines CCL19 macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3β and CCL21 (secondary lymphoid organ chemokine), which share a common receptor, CCR7 (2Forster R.

Both CCL19 and CCL21 are constitutively expressed in lymphoid organs, particularly by cells throughout the T cell zones (10Kim C.H. Pelus L.M. White J.R. Applebaum E. Johanson K. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2418-2424PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cyster J.G. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R30-R33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Cyster J.G. J. Exp.

In addition to this observation, CCL21 is also expressed in high endothelial venules in the lymph nodes and in lymphatic endothelial cells lining the afferent lymphatics in peripheral tissues. Studies on CCR7–/– and plt (paucity of lymph node t cells) mice have demonstrated the importance of these ligands and CCR7 in the correct development of microarchitecture within 2° lymphoid organs as well as in naïve T cell and DC homing to lymph nodes (1Kim C.H. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Gunn M.D. Kyuwa S. Tam C. Kakiuchi T. Matsuzawa A. Williams L.T. Nakano H. J. Exp.

A. 2000; 97: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, using these models, it has proven impossible to distinguish between the roles of CCL21 and CCL19 in the immune system. The plt mouse is deficient in both CCL21 and CCL19, and the CCR7–/– mouse does not allow discrimination between the two ligands. The results of recent studies using neutralizing anti-CCL21 antibodies indicate the importance of CCL21 for mature DC trafficking from the skin to draining lymph nodes and in the development of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to hapten (16Saeki H. Moore A.M. Brown M.J. Hwang S.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2472-2475PubMed Google Scholar, 17Engeman T.M. Gorbachev A.V. Gladue R.P. Heeger P.S. Fairchild R.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5207-5214Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and transgenic studies have demonstrated that ectopic expression of either CCL19 or CCL21 under the control of the rat insulin promoter in the pancreas results in lymphocyte and dendritic cell recruitment and lymphoid neogenesis (15Luther S.A.

However, the biological function of CCL19, particularly the question of whether or not it is redundant to CCL21, remains unresolved. The use of synthetic chemokine antagonists has proven useful in elucidating the role of specific chemokines in several different aspects of the immune response. The N-terminal deletion converts CCL2 monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and CCL5 (RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)) into the antagonists of native CCL2, CCL5, CCL8 (MCP-3), and CCL3 (MIP-1α), respectively (20Gong J.H. Clark Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21Gong J.H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Clark Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas retention of the initiating methionine converts CCL5 into a receptor antagonist (22Proudfoot A.E.

These antagonists have been shown to prevent the entry of human immunodeficiency virus into target cells (23Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R.

Lett. 1997; 57: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that truncated CXCL1 (groα) and CXCL4 (platelet factor 4) analogs antagonizing muCXCR2 inhibit neutrophil recruitment to subcutaneous tissue and the peritoneal cavity in response to pro-inflammatory agents (27McColl S.R. Clark Lewis I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2829-2835PubMed Google Scholar). We now report the development of a specific CCL19 antagonist that has enabled us to examine the role of CCL19 in vivo, independently of CCL21. Using this antagonist, we demonstrate a role for CCL19 in CD8+ T cell activation in response to allogeneic DCs. The results of these studies indicate for the first time an important non-redundant role for CCL19 in the allogeneic immune response. Reagents—All of the synthetic murine peptides used were made as described previously (20Gong J.H. Clark Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The CCL2(4Ala) control peptide was also a synthetic peptide, the sequence of which was identical to human CCL2(9–76), with the exception that the four conserved cysteines of the native peptide were substituted with alanines (20Gong J.H. Clark Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Human CCL19-Fc was a generous gift from Dr. Timothy Springer (Center for Blood Research, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Animals and Cells Lines—Female BALB/c mice (H-2d), aged 8–12 weeks, were obtained from the Central Animal House at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. The animals were housed in conventional rodent rooms at the University of Adelaide where they were provided with food and water ad libitum. A conditionally immortalized dendritic cell line transgenic for the thermolabile mutant of the SV40 large T antigen, raised from a CBA background (H-2k), was used to induce an allogeneic immune response in BALB/c mice (28Volkmann A. Neefjes J. Stockinger B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In Vitro Chemotaxis Assay—Transwell chemotaxis assays using primary splenocytes were conducted as previously described (29Kohler R.E. Caon A.C. Willenborg D.O. Clark-Lewis I. McColl S.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6298-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions were placed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Following 24 h of culture, cells were labeled by incubating with Calcein-AM (2 μm of final concentration; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended to 5 × 106 viable cells/ml in chemotaxis buffer and subjected to Transwell chemotaxis assays (6.5-mm-diameter filter, 5 μm pore size, Corning, NY). 600 μl of chemotaxis buffer containing the indicated concentration of CCL19, CCL21, and/or chemokine mutant were added to the lower chambers of a Transwell plate. After adding 100 μl of labeled cells to the upper chambers, the assay was conducted for 3 h at 37 °C and cells were collected from the lower chamber. The cells in the lower chamber were quantified by transferring to a 96-well microtiter tray and measuring fluorescence. The percentage migration of cells was calculated by comparison with a standard curve obtained from cells added at known decreasing concentrations directly to the lower chamber of the Transwell plate. Induction and Manipulation of the Allogeneic Immune Response— Confluent flasks of the tsDC cell line were differentiated at 39 °C for 24 h and then detached from the surface of the flask, washed, and resuspended to 2 × 107 viable cells/ml in endotoxin-free PBS. BALB/c mice were injected with 25 μl of cells subcutaneously per footpad. Control footpads received 25 μl of endotoxin-free PBS. On the day following injection with PBS or tsDCs (day 1), bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) was dissolved in water to 0.8 mg/ml and fed to the mice ad libitum for 2 days before replacement with fresh solution on day 3. One day prior to injection with either PBS or tsDCs, half of the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of CCL19(8–83) and the other half were treated with 100 μg of CCL2(4Ala). This treatment was repeated every second day until termination of the experiment. At days 2 and 5 post-induction, the mice were sacrificed and the draining lymph nodes (popliteal) were removed for analysis. Cytotoxicity Assay—The target cells, tsDCs, cultured at 33 °C were resuspended in PBS and labeled with the fluorescent dye, Calcein-AM (2 μm of final concentration), in a 37 °C water bath for 40 min. Following two washes in PBS, subconfluent monolayers of labeled target cells were generated in 96-well trays by aliquoting 5 × 104 viable tsDCs into each well in a 100-μl volume. The cells were allowed to adhere for at least 5 h, after which time the medium was aspirated and 200 μl of effector cells (lymphocytes from extracted nodes) in RPMI 1640 medium, 5% fetal calf serum were added at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well. The assay was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, and then the culture medium was aspirated and lymphocytes and target cell debris were washed away by immersing trays in four consecutive baths of PBS. Subsequently, 100 μl of PBS were added to each well and the degree of target cell monolayer remaining was quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at 520 nm on a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad), allowing the percent cytotoxicity to be determined. Calcium Mobilization—Cells were resuspended at 2 × 107 viable cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with Fura-2/AM (2 μm of final concentration; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Calcium mobilization was assayed after single or sequential stimulation with chemokines or chemokine analogs by recording intracellular calcium-related fluorescence changes on an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer. Displacement Assay—Cells were resuspended to 4 × 106 viable cells/ml in PBS containing 0.04% sodium azide and 1% bovine serum albumin (mouse staining buffer). Fc receptors were blocked by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μg/106 cells of murine γ-globulin, and then 50 μl of cells were aliquoted into round-bottomed polystyrene tubes. Cells were then incubated with CCL19-Fc for 10 min on ice followed by an additional 10-min incubation on ice with increasing concentrations of the ligands CCL19, CCL21, CCL2(4Ala), or CCL19(8–83). The cells were then washed with mouse-staining buffer before being incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antihuman IgG and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice in mouse-staining buffer followed by a rinse in protein-free staining buffer and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Labeled cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan, and the data were analyzed using WEASEL software (Frank Battye, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Victoria, Australia). For most analyses, lymphocytes were gated using forward and side angle light scattering characteristics and the background staining observed using control supernatant was subtracted from all of the percentages. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). The two-tailed unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. For all of the analyses, the p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Data in the text are presented as the mean ± S.E. To develop the assay for characterization of an antagonist, chemotactic dose response curves to both muCCL19 and muCCL21 were generated in primary mouse splenocytes. The expected bell-shaped curves were obtained in response to both CCL19 and CCL21 (Fig. 1A). CCL19 induced detectable migration at 0.01 μg/ml and optimal chemotaxis at 0.3 μg/ml, affecting the migration of ∼50% of the total input cells. In comparison, CCL21-induced migration was detectable between 0.1 and 0.3 μg/ml and optimal chemotaxis required 3 μg/ml CCL21. However, over a series of eight individual experiments, this resulted in the migration of 20% more cells than that observed in response to CCL19 (i.e. 70% of total input cells). In a parallel set of experiments, flow cytometric analysis was performed on cells harvested from Transwell chemotaxis assays to test whether CCL19 or CCL21 induced selective migration of CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes. No selective migration of either cell type was observed when comparing the percentage of input cells with the percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells obtained from the bottom chamber of the Transwell plate (data not shown). Concentrations of 0.2 and 0.5 μg/ml were chosen for CCL19 and CCL21, respectively, for in vitro chemotaxis inhibition assays to identify and characterize a CCL19 antagonist. A series of truncation mutants of muCCL19 were synthesized and analyzed for their ability to antagonize CCL19- and/or CCL21-induced chemotaxis. These mutants were truncated at the N terminus, generating a series of seven mutants (Fig. 1B). The shortest mutant, CCL19(8–83) commenced at the first conserved cysteine and this cysteine was acetylated to increase stability of the truncated protein. The four longest mutants (CCL19(2–83)–CCL19(5–83)) were each able to directly induce chemotaxis in a manner similar to that of wild type CCL19. In contrast, neither CCL19(8–83), CCL19(7–73), nor CCL19(6–83) induced chemotaxis of naïve splenocytes (Fig. 1C). Therefore, these three latter mutants were tested as potential antagonists of CCL19-mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 1D). Each of these mutants inhibited CCL19-mediated chemotaxis. However, the optimal concentration varied among the mutants with the general trend being the shorter the mutant the lower the concentration required to inhibit chemotaxis. CCL19(8–83) was the least agonistic mutant and was a highly effective antagonist of CCL19-mediated chemotaxis when compared with the other two mutants and therefore was selected for a further more detailed analysis. Over a large number of experiments, CCL19(8–83) consistently and significantly inhibited wild type CCL19-mediated chemotaxis at a concentration as low as 1.5 μg/ml (7.5-fold excess of antagonist w/w or 7.5:1 ratio). When the antagonist was used at a 30:1 ratio, chemotaxis was inhibited by ∼65%. At 50 μg/ml (250:1 ratio), CCL19(8–83) almost completely inhibited CCL19-mediated chemotaxis (approximately 83%). To examine the specificity of antagonism of CCL19-mediated chemotaxis, a control peptide, CCL2(4Ala), in which the conserved cysteines were mutated to alanine was used in these experiments. CCL2(4Ala) did not inhibit CCL19-induced cellular migration (Fig. 1E). Because CCL19 and CCL21 both interact with CCR7, the effect of CCL19(8–83) on CCL21-induced chemotaxis was investigated. CCL19(8–83) did not antagonize CCL21-mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, CCL19(8–83) had no effect on the ability of the closely related CC chemokine, CCL20 (MIP-3α), to induce chemotaxis (data not shown). Finally, it was found that CCL19(8–83) inhibited CCL19-induced chemotaxis of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (data not shown). A CCL19-Fc fusion protein was generated, which was able to bind CCR7 in the same manner as its native ligands, with the fused Fc portion, allowing detection by flow cytometry. A dose-dependent binding curve for CCL19-Fc to splenocytes was generated (data not shown). The dose resulting in maximum binding was chosen for further studies in which the ability of CCL19, CCL21, or CCL19(8–83) to displace the fusion protein was examined. Cells were preincubated with CCL19-Fc followed by an incubation with increasing concentrations of the native ligands (CCL19 and CCL21) or the CCL19 analog (CCL19(8–83)). The cells then were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the level of binding of CCL19-Fc. In the absence of competitive ligand, ∼40% of cells from a spleen were found to be positive for CCL19-Fc (Fig. 2, A and B). CCL19, CCL21, and CCL19(8–83) were all able to displace the CCL19-Fc in a dose-dependent manner with the order of potency being CCL19 > CCL19(8–83) ≥ CCL21 (Fig. 2C). However the control peptide, CCL2(4Ala), did not displace the fusion protein even at the highest concentration tested. Overall, these date indicate that CCL19(8–83) displaces wild type CCL19 to approximately the same extent as does CCL21. Consistent with that observed in the chemotaxis assays, the mobilization of intracellular calcium induced by CCL19 was inhibited by CCL19(8–83), whereas CCL21-induced calcium mobilization was not inhibited (Fig. 3). Furthermore, CCL19(8–83) alone did not induce calcium mobilization, confirming its lack of agonistic activity. When cells were treated with wild type CCL19 or wild type CCL21, a consistent increase in the level of intracellular calcium was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). Prior exposure of the cells to the control peptide, CCL2(4Ala), had no effect on the ability of either of the native ligands to induce calcium mobilization, demonstrating that the control peptide was unable to nonspecifically antagonize the CCR7 ligands (Fig. 3, C and D). However, when cells were treated with CCL19(8–83) prior to treatment with the native ligands, the increase in intracellular free calcium induced by wild type CCL19 was completely inhibited (Fig. 3E), whereas the increase in intracellular free calcium induced by wild type CCL21 was unaffected (Fig. 3F). A summary of three experiments is shown in Fig. 3G. Previously, CCL19 and CCL21 have been indistinguishable in terms of their individual functions within the immune system; therefore, the ability of CCL19(8–83) to antagonize CCL19 but not CCL21 enabled the examination of the role of CCL19 independently of CCL21. To investigate this finding, an allogeneic immune response was induced in BALB/c mice by injection of foreign dendritic cells (CBA-derived) into the footpads of mice that had been treated with either the control peptide, CCL2(4Ala), or CCL19(8–83). The draining lymph nodes were extracted, and various parameters were determined. In preliminary experiments, the appropriate dose of alloDCs and the time course of the allogeneic response were assessed and days 2 and 5 post-immunization were chosen for further analysis (data not shown). Mice were either untreated (no chemokine treatment, no alloDCs) or treated with 100 μg (intraperitoneal injection) of either CCL2(4Ala) (control) or CCL19(8–83) the day prior to footpad injection of alloDCs. The chemokines were re-administered every 2 days for the duration of the experiment. This dosing regimen was chosen on the basis of our previous experience with other chemokine mutants (25Gong J.H. Ratkay L.G. Waterfield J.D. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 27McColl S.R. Clark Lewis I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2829-2835PubMed Google Scholar). The weight of the lymph nodes and the number of viable cells present were assessed on day 2 post-immunization with alloDCs in mice treated as described above with either CCL2(4Ala) or CCL19(8–83) (Fig. 4A, data not shown for lymph node weight). These data were compared with the same parameters found in naïve mice (control). The number of cells was found to be the same in all of the conditions tested, although there was a trend (not statistically significant) for more cells to be present in the nodes from CCL19(8–83)-treated mice. In contrast, the immunization of mice with alloDCs for 5 days resulted in a significant increase in the lymph node weight and the number of viable cells in the draining lymph nodes in animals treated with either CCL2(4Ala) or CCL19(8–83) (Fig. 4B; data not shown for lymph node weight). Moreover, treatment with CCL19(8–83) exhibited the same trend toward increasing the number of viable cells present in the draining lymph nodes upon immunization. Cytotoxic activity of draining lymph node cells toward alloDCs in vitro was increased by both days 2 and 5 post-immunization with alloDCs (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the level of cytotoxic activity was significantly greater on day 5 compared with day 2. In contrast to that observed with respect to cellular accumulation in the draining lymph nodes, cells isolated from mice treated with CCL19(8–83) exhibited a significantly lower level of cytotoxicity toward the alloDCs when compared with CCL2(4Ala)-treated mice. The majority of information on the in vivo function of the CCL19/CCL21/CCR7 system has been derived from studies on either CCR7–/– mice or plt mice, neither of which distinguish between CCL19 and CCL21 (1Kim C.H. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Gunn M.D. Kyuwa S. Tam C. Kakiuchi T. Matsuzawa A. Williams L.T. Nakano H. J. Exp.

A. 2000; 97: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Studies in transgenic mice have revealed that overexpression of either CCL19 or CCL21 leads to lymphoid neogenesis (15Luther S.A.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, to date, information defining the specific roles for CCL19 in vivo during the generation of an immune response is lacking. The results of the present study using a specific CCL19 antagonist provide important and novel insights into the biology of CCL19. First, our ability to specifically target CCL19 using a novel CCL19 antagonist has revealed an important role for CCL19 in lymphocyte and lymph node biology that is independent of CCL21. Second, CCL19 appears to play an important role in CTL priming because the inhibition of CCL19 activity during a primary allogeneic response decreases the level of cytotoxicity toward alloDCs. CCL19(8–83) clearly antagonized wild type CCL19 activity toward naïve splenocytes, displacing the binding of CCL19-Fc and inhibiting wild type-induced chemotaxis and calcium mobilization. However, this antagonist did not inhibit the stimulatory effects of CCL21 on naïve splenocytes. In a recent study, a CCL21 antagonist that inhibited both chemotaxis and calcium mobilization induced by CCL21 was identified (30Sasaki M. Hasegawa H. Kohno M. Inoue A. Ito M.R. Fujita S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In that study, it was also shown that the administration of the antagonist significantly reduced the development of graft-versus-host disease in mice (30Sasaki M. Hasegawa H. Kohno M. Inoue A. Ito M.R. Fujita S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the authors concluded that CCL21 played an important role in graft-versus-host disease. However, in preliminary studies, we have synthesized and characterized CCL21 mutants and have demonstrated that the N-terminal truncation mutants of CCL21 not only inhibit CCL21-mediated chemotaxis but also CCL19-mediated chemotaxis (data not shown). Therefore, because the antagonist used in the study by Sasaki et al. (30Sasaki M. Hasegawa H. Kohno M. Inoue A. Ito M.R. Fujita S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) does not discriminate between the functions of the two ligands, it is still possible that the inhibition of graft-versus-host disease observed in that study may be due to antagonism of CCL19 and not CCL21. The mechanism by which CCL19(8–83) interferes with CTL generation is not clear. The phenotype we observed using this antagonist was not what would be predicted based on the results of studies on the CCR7–/– and plt mice. Those mice displayed severely disrupted lymphoid organ architecture with a complete lack of defined T and B cell zones and significantly fewer lymphocytes in the secondary lymphoid organs. DC trafficking to the T cell zones was also severely affected. Despite this finding, a chronic absence of the CCR7 system does not inevitably lead to the inhibition of the immune response. Although antibody, contact sensitivity, and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are diminished in CCR7–/– mice (in keeping with lower levels of lymphocyte and DC trafficking to the 2° lymphoid organs) (1Kim C.H. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), CTL and antibody responses to LCMV, VV, and VSV are normal in the plt mouse (31Junt T. Nakano H. Dumrese T. Kakiuchi T. Odermatt B. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Ludewig B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6032-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The increased CTL response against the latter viruses observed in the plt mouse suggests that either the role of CCL19 in viral immunity is different from that in allogeneic immunity (in which we observed a decrease in CTL activity) or a chronic absence of both CCL19 and CCL21 leads to a fundamentally different outcome compared with the pharmacological intervention used in the present study. The results of our studies indicate that the administration of CCL19(8–83) does not significantly alter the number of lymphocytes within the draining lymph node following immunization (Fig. 4). Moreover, extensive immunohistochemistry experiments revealed no discernable alteration in the distribution of either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells within the draining lymph nodes. Together, these observations suggest a more subtle effect on the immune response than that observed in either of the mutant mouse strains. The patterns of expression of CCL19 and CCL21 may provide some insight into our observations. CCL21 is expressed in the draining lymphatics, on high endothelial venules, and by stromal cells in the T cell zones of the 2° lymphoid organs (15Luther S.A. Tang H.L. Hyman P.L. Farr A.G. Cyster J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). CCL19 is also expressed by stromal cells in the T cell zones (13Ngo V.N. Tang H.L. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, interdigitating DCs appear to also produce CCL19 (14Gunn M.D. Kyuwa S. Tam C. Kakiuchi T. Matsuzawa A. Williams L.T. Nakano H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 32Yoshida R. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Baba M. Kitaura M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13803-13809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that CCL19 production by interdigitating DCs is critical for the appropriate positioning of naïve and recently activated T cells in the T cell zones for efficient clonal selection and expansion to occur. Such a function would explain that antagonism of CCL19 during the allogeneic immune response does not prevent T cells from entering the 2° lymphoid organs and the T cell zones (CCL21 is still active). However, if CCL19 is critical for the multiple T cell-DC interactions that are required for effective clonal selection and differentiation of T cells to occur, antagonism could inhibit CTL generation. In summary, the results of this study using a novel antagonist provide important insights into the biological role of the homeostatic chemokine CCL19. Previously, it has been impossible to discriminate between the effects of CCL21 and CCL19; however, the development of this specific antagonist provides a useful tool not only for the examination of the CCL19/CCL21/CCR7 system but also as a proof-of-concept for therapeutic modulation of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2034991285,"Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which contributes substantially to the regulation of normal mitochondrial metabolism, also plays a crucial role in the initiation of cell death. It is known that MPT is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The importance of MPT in the pancreatic β-cell is heightened by the fact that mitochondrial bioenergetics serve as the main glucose-sensing regulator and energy source for insulin secretion. In the present study, using MIN6 and INS-1 β-cells, we revealed that both Ca2+-phosphate- and oxidant-induced MPT is remarkably different from other tissues. Ca2+-phosphate-induced transition is accompanied by a decline in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production related to a significant potential dependence of reactive oxygen species formation in β-cell mitochondria. Hydroperoxides, which are indirect MPT co-inducers active in liver and heart mitochondria, are inefficient in β-cell mitochondria, due to the low mitochondrial ability to metabolize them. Direct cross-linking of mitochondrial thiols in pancreatic β-cells induces the opening of a low conductance ion permeability of the mitochondrial membrane instead of the full scale MPT opening typical for liver mitochondria. Low conductance MPT is independent of both endogenous and exogenous Ca2+, suggesting a novel type of nonclassical MPT in β-cells. It results in the conversion of electrical transmembrane potential into ΔpH instead of a decrease in total protonmotive force, thus mitochondrial respiration remains in a controlled state. Both Ca2+- and oxidant-induced MPTs are phosphate-dependent and, through the “phosphate flush” (associated with stimulation of insulin secretion), are expected to participate in the regulation in β-cell glucose-sensing and secretory activity.

Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) 1The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; ROS, reactive oxygen species; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein; PhArs, phenylarsine oxide; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. is a permeability increase of the inner mitochondrial membrane to solutes of molecular mass up to ∼1500 Da, which is caused by an opening of specific nonselective proteinaceous pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane (1Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Increased permeability of the inner membrane is initiated by an increased level of intramitochondrial Ca2+ and is regulated by multiple effectors, including inorganic phosphate, the redox state of pyridine nucleotides and thiols (oxidative stress), membrane potential, cyclosporin A, and other factors (3Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). MPT pores are thought to have at least two open conformations and a variable degree of reversibility. Most importantly, MPT in its different forms contributes to both normal cell physiology (regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and Ca2+ metabolism) and to regulatory processes leading to apoptosis (2Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 3Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys.

Specific features of MPT show significant tissue-specific variability (5Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J.

Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The most significant and well documented deviation from classical MPT described in liver mitochondria was observed in brain tissue (9Berman S.B. Watkins S.C. Hastings T.G. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 164: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Brain mitochondria demonstrate high resistance to MPT opening (10Schild L. Keilhoff G. Augustin W. Reiser G. Striggow F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), low sensitivity to cyclosporin A (5Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), different responses to MPT modifiers, and a distinctive composition of Ca2+-phosphate complexes sequestered in the matrix (11Panov A.V. Andreeva L. Greenamyre J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 424: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from skeletal muscle, unlike hepatocyte mitochondria, show the dependence of MPT on electron flux through respiratory complex 1 (12Chauvin C. De Oliveira F. Ronot X. Mousseau M. Leverve X. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41394-41398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Most importantly, basal endogenous MPT activity (transient pore opening), which affects Ca2+ signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and ROS production, is different in different cell types, which can be attributed to the variable cellular redox states (13Kowaltowski A.J. Smaili S.S. Russell J.T. Fiskum G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C852-C859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in pancreatic β-cells demonstrate a dual role for MPT. Studies examining the role of cytokines in the pancreatic β-cell indicated, by means of mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release, that MPT is a common effector of both apoptosis and necrosis (14Barbu A. Welsh N. Saldeen J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Contreras J.L. Smyth C.A. Bilbao G. Young C.J. Thompson J.A. Eckhoff D.E. Transplantation. 2002; 74: 1252-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, MPT is implicated in β-cell death, which is a key factor in the etiology of type 1 diabetes and a potentially important contributor to some forms of type 2 diabetes (16Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to type 2 diabetes, inhibition of MPT opening with cyclosporin A was found to suppress glucose-induced insulin secretion, suggesting that a basal level of MPT transient opening (flickering) is important for β-cell secretory function (17Dufer M. Krippeit-Drews P. Lembert N. Idahl L.A. Drews G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies examining MPT in β-cells were performed using intact cell preparations, and the manipulation of the mitochondrial functional state, specifically controlling the levels of MPT effectors, is extremely difficult. A better understanding of MPT in the β-cell requires a more detailed investigation at the mitochondrial level. Permeabilized clonal pancreatic β-cells allow for direct experimental access to mitochondria within the cell and, therefore, provide an appropriate system for detailed investigation of mitochondrial bioenergetics under conditions inducing MPT. The pancreatic mouse β-cell line, MIN6, was the primary model used for this study as it has been shown to retain insulin-secretory responses to glucose and other secretagogues and has been used extensively in studies of β-cell metabolism (18Soejima A. Inoue K. Takai D. Kaneko M. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Hayashi J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Minami K. Yano H. Miki T.

Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Key findings were verified by using another widely used rat β-cell line, INS-1 (21Poitout V. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1996; 22: 7-14Google Scholar). We demonstrate that mitochondria from both MIN6 and INS-1 cells exhibited novel MPT characteristics as follows: (i) Ca2+-phosphate-induced MPT is associated with reduced (instead of enhanced) mitochondrial ROS formation; (ii) initiation of MPT with hydroperoxides does not happen in intact β-cell mitochondria but requires exogenous glutathione peroxidase mimetic activity; and (iii) nonclassical MPT, caused by thiol cross-linking, is entirely independent of mitochondrial Ca2+ and causes the interconversion of electrical and chemical components of the mitochondrial protonmotive force. The role of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in MPT in the β-cell is of particular interest, as the stimulation of insulin secretion is associated with a significant drop in the Pi level (“phosphate flush”). Here we demonstrate that inorganic phosphate in the physiological range enhances the effect of Ca2+ on the MPT, while suppressing the effects of thiol oxidants. This supports a potential link between insulin-secretory activity and Ca2+- and oxidant-induced MPT in the β-cell. Reagents—Clonal pancreatic β-cells MIN6 (a gift from Dr. S. Seino, Chiba University, Japan) and INS-1 (a gift from Dr. C. Wollheim, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland, passage number 68) were used in this study. Ca-Green 5N and Amplex Red were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Growth and Permeabilization of Cells—MIN6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For INS-1 cells RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was used. After 4–6 days of growth, with daily medium change, trypsinized cells were washed in Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB buffer, 120 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and permeabilized essentially as described by Civelek et al. (22Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Shalosky N.J. Tornheim K. Hansford R.G. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 × 107 cells were suspended in 0.7 ml of KRB buffer containing 80 μg/ml saponin. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the cells were centrifuged (735 × g for 3 min) at 4 °C and washed in cold KRB buffer. At this point more than a half of the total cellular protein and more than 80% of soluble malate dehydrogenase was found in the supernatant. Finally, the permeabilized cells were suspended in cold 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and stored at 0–4 °C until required. All experiments were performed in the MIN6 line origin, and the main findings were validated by using INS-1 β-cells. Respiration Measurements—Mitochondrial O2 consumption was measured using a Clark-type electrode coupled to an Oxygraph unit (Hansatech, Pentney, UK). Permeabilized cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.6–0.9 mg of protein/ml in incubation medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2,20 μm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, varying concentrations of Pi, pH 7.3 (adjusted with KOH). Glycerol 3-phosphate (7.5 mm), 10 mm succinate, 5/5 mm glutamate/malate were used as respiratory substrates. Oxygen kinetic traces were treated as described by Estabrook (23Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1896) Google Scholar), and respiration rates were converted into molar oxygen units using O2 solubility in sucrose medium, as reported by Reynafarje et al. (24Reynafarje B. Costa L.E. Lehninger A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Monitoring—Mitchondrial membrane potential was monitored by observing safranin O fluorescence (25Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 26Vercesi A.E. Bernardes C.F. Hoffmann M.E. Gadelha F.R. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14431-14434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in suspensions of permeabilized cells. Measurements were performed using a FluoroCount plate reader (Packard Instrument Co.) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm. A decrease in fluorescence corresponded to an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. Incubation medium for permeabilized cells was essentially identical to that used for respiratory assays but was further supplemented with 2.5 μm safranin. NAD(P)H Assay and Intramitochondrial pH Measurement—The extent of mitochondrial NAD(P)H reduction in permeabilized cells was estimated by fluorescence at excitation/emission wavelengths of 360/460 nm according to Ref. 27Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4895-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. To estimate dynamics of intramitochondrial pH, permeabilized cells were loaded with BCECF-AM essentially as described previously (28Kowaltowski A.J. Cosso R.G. Campos C.B. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42802-42807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Epifluorescent imaging of individual BCECF-loaded cells was performed using an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective, in combination with an Ultrapix camera and a PC computer with Merlin imaging software (LSR Inc., UK). BCECF fluorescence from the cell suspension was monitored with a FluoroCount plate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 490/530 nm. Fluorometric Determination of Reactive Oxygen Species and Cytochrome c Assay—ROS production was assayed as hydrogen peroxide formation by monitoring fluorescein or Amplex Red oxidation in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (29Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30Starkov A.A. Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Appearance of dichlorofluorescein (DCF) from nonfluorescent reduced form was monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths 485/530 nm. DCF was obtained from the stable compound DCF diacetate by alkaline hydrolysis (31Black M.J. Brandt R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For Amplex Red measurement, wavelengths of 550/590 nm were used. The high concentrations (1.55 units/ml) and the low Km value of peroxidase helps to circumvent interference from endogenous hydrogen peroxidemetabolizing enzymes (32Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release from the intermembrane mitochondrial space was estimated by assaying it in the incubation medium, using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) (30Starkov A.A. Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Insulin Secretion Assay—MIN6 cells cultured in 12-well plates were washed and preincubated for two sequential 30-min periods in a modified glucose-free Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB buffer, 115 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation for 1 h in the same buffer containing 0 or 16.7 mm glucose in the absence or presence of 5 μm cyclosporin A. Insulin secretion in response to glucose was quantified using a radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Calcium Phosphate-induced MPT and Mitochondrial ROS Production—Because experiments in permeabilized β-cells were supplemented with respiratory substrate but not ATP, only mitochondrial Ca2+ stores were available under these experimental conditions. This was verified by using inhibitors of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake as shown in Fig. 1. Glycerol 3-phosphate was used as the main respiratory substrate for two reasons. First, because of the high glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in pancreatic β-cells (27Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4895-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this substrate exhibits the highest respiratory control ratio, and as such, it is possible to observe the full range of mitochondrial functional states. Second, glycerol 3-phosphate is a physiologically important mitochondrial substrate in β-cells where the glycerophosphate shuttle ensures coupling between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation (27Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4895-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and takes part in the activation of insulin secretion (33Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N.

MIN6 cells exhibit high activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase similar to that in primary β-cells (34Ishihara H. Nakazaki M. Kanegae Y. Inukai K. Asano T. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Miyazaki J. Saito I. Oka Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is activated by divalent cations, including the main MPT-inducer Ca2+ (35Beleznai Z. Szalay L. Jancsik V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, to ensure independence of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity on the experimental variation in Ca2+ concentration, the medium contained a high concentration of glycerol 3-phosphate (7.5 mm) and a physiological level of magnesium (1 mm). The presence of magnesium also maintained optimal mitochondrial coupling and did not qualitatively change mitochondrial responses to MPT inducers. The suitability of permeabilized β-cells for studying MPT is demonstrated by Fig. 2A, showing gradual acceleration of respiration, decreased membrane potential, and exhaustion of Ca2+ loading capacity of MIN6 cell mitochondria upon titration with Ca2+, which are typical characteristics of MPT. At moderate Ca2+ loads (<60–80 μm), MPT was reversible as indicated by the restoration of membrane potential and state 4 respiration rate upon addition of 1 μm cyclosporin A or 1 mm EGTA (data not shown). Ca2+ exerted these effects in the presence of 2.5 mm Pi (Fig. 2A), which was the first MPT co-inducer described (3Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). Because of the fundamental importance of Pi in MPT regulation, it is of interest that initiation and cessation of insulin secretion in β-cells is accompanied by the decrease and restoration, respectively, of the cellular Pi concentration (36Giroix M.H.

This so-called phosphate flush amounts to 40–50% of the initial cytosolic Pi level (2–4 mm) (38Trus M. Warner H. Matschinsky F. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Bukowiecki L. Trus M. Matschinsky F.M. Freinkel N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 583: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the concentration range in which Pi regulates MPT in β-cell mitochondria in greater detail. Sustained activation of mitochondrial respiration with Ca2+, reflecting MPT opening at the different Pi levels, is shown in Fig. 2B. Here MPT-stimulated mitochondrial oxygen consumption in β-cells is highly sensitive to Pi concentrations in the 0.5–5 mm range, suggesting that Pi-dependent MPT provides an additional link between insulin-secreting activity and mitochondrial functional state in β-cells. Increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered an essential step in the mechanism of Ca2+-phosphate-induced MPT. This was deduced from the stimulation of ROS generation in the liver mitochondria respiratory chain by Ca2+ and Pi (42Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Grijalba M.T. Bechara E.J. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 43Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E.

The mitochondrial production of ROS could be of even greater importance in β-cells, which contain only low levels of antioxidant enzymes (45Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 46Tiedge M. Lortz S. Drinkgern J. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Lenzen S. Drinkgern J. Tiedge M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Consequently, we monitored the production of H2O2 (estimated by Amplex Red fluorescence) which accompanied Ca2+-phosphate-stimulated MPT (estimated by stimulation of mitochondrial respiration). We found that Ca2+ in the presence of Pi causes MPT opening (Fig. 3B) but inhibited, rather than stimulated, H2O2 production (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed when ROS production was monitored with another ROS-sensitive probe (DCF) or when the order of the addition of Ca2+ and phosphate were reversed (data not shown). Thus the relationship between Ca2+ load and mitochondrial ROS production in MIN6 β-cells is distinct from that seen in liver (42Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Grijalba M.T. Bechara E.J. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 43Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) but resembles the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on ROS generation reported in brain mitochondria (30Starkov A.A. Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This duality of function can arise because of the variety of ways mitochondrial ROS can be induced. Mitochondrial formation of ROS results from a highly reduced state of the respiratory chain, caused by either hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (typically complex I) or by substantial inhibition of respiratory flux (complex III) (48Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 49Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 50Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 51Miwa S. Brand M.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1300-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the most physiologically relevant mitochondrial ROS production is from complex I, in particular driven by reverse electron transfer (51Miwa S. Brand M.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1300-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway is very sensitive to membrane potential and, hence, Ca2+-induced mitochondrial depolarization. Therefore, we considered if this mechanism applies to our experimental system. The ability of the respiratory substrate glycerol 3-phosphate to support reverse electron transfer is not well documented. It has been observed in insect flight muscle mitochondria (52Chance B. Hollunger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Miwa S. St Pierre J. Partridge L. Brand M.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) but could not be detected in mitochondria from mouse brain and kidney (54Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This discrepancy was attributed to the tissue-specific difference between the electron transfer mechanisms of succinate and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (54Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 55Drahota Z. Chowdhury S.K. Floryk D. Mracek T. Wilhelm J. Rauchova H. Lenaz G. Houstek J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In permeabilized β-cells we found that succinate (classical substrate for reverse electron transfer) and glycerol 3-phosphate cause a similar increase of the NAD(P)H fluorescence, which is negated by the uncoupler FCCP (Fig. 4). This provides evidence for reverse electron transport from glycerol 3-phosphate to complex I, which can support the generation of ROS at this site. Indeed, glycerol 3-phosphate-dependent ROS production is inhibited by rotenone (inhibitor of complex I and reverse electron transfer) to 35 ± 3% (n = 3) of the initial rate (data not shown). This mechanism of ROS formation explains the inhibitory rather than stimulatory action of Ca2+ and Pi on mitochondrial oxygen radicals in MIN6 cells by Ca2+-induced mitochondrial depolarization. In addition, the direct inhibitory action of Ca2+ on the mitochondrial H2O2-producing site was reported recently (56Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4166-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The effect of Ca2+ and Pi on ROS production, supported by NAD-linked respiratory substrates (glutamate/malate), was also investigated. They were shown not to stimulate mitochondrial H2O2 production (data not shown). MPT in the Presence of Hydroperoxides—In liver and heart mitochondria, hydroperoxides and other oxidants serve as potent co-inducers of MPT initiated by Ca2+ (1Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). To test for the occurrence of Ca2+ prooxidant-induced MPT in MIN6 cells, we used tert-butyl and cumene hydroperoxides as models for naturally produced peroxides. Neither compound had a significant effect on membrane potential (Fig. 5), respiration, or Ca2+ retention in mitochondria nor did they affect Ca2+-phosphate-induced mitochondrial permeabilization (data not shown). We attribute this to the fact that the effect of peroxides on MPT is mediated by the glutathione peroxidase/glutathione reductase system, which results in glutathione and NAD(P)H oxidation, an oxidative shift in the mitochondrial redox state and finally oxidation of critical thiol groups governing MPT opening (4Halestrap A.P.

TGF-β signal transduction is mediated intracellularly by the Smad proteins, including the R-Smads (receptor-regulated Smads), the I-Smads (inhibitor Smads), and the Co-Smad (common Smad). Ligand binding to the TGF-β receptor complex or a homologous complex leads to receptor phosphorylation of the R-Smads (7Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L.

Subsequently, the phosphorylated R-Smads can interact with the Co-Smad, Smad4, and accumulate in the nucleus (9Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

In the nucleus the Smad proteins bind to transcription factors and promoter regions and play a role in the transcription of various genes (11Ignotz R.A. Massague J. J. Biol.

The R-Smads and Smad4 consist of a conserved N-terminal Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain and a conserved C-terminal MH2 domain joined by a poorly conserved linker region. The MH1 domain is known to function in binding DNA (13Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain appears to exhibit many different roles and binds to many different proteins. Although many modular protein domains involved in signal transduction, such as SH3, SH2, WW, PTB, and PDZ domains, interact with a recognizable sequence motif (14Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), MH2 domains appear to be able to bind to a wide variety of ligands that do not share a single common motif.

These interacting partners represent a diverse group of protein types, encompassing receptors, membrane anchoring proteins, and transcription factors. Furthermore, they have no region of sequence or structural similarity in common. A key question is how the MH2 domain functions in such a versatile manner, i.e. what properties allow the MH2 domain to maintain specificity despite being able to recognize a diverse group of proteins. To examine the unique properties of the MH2, we have focused on the interaction between Smad2 and SARA because it is the best characterized. SARA is an anchoring protein that specifically binds to Smad2 and 3, transporting them to the receptor complex and increasing the efficiency of phosphorylation by the receptors (15Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of Smad2 and Smad3 MH2 bound to the 60-residue SBD of SARA have provided evidence for an extensive hydrophobic interaction surface on the MH2 (26Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The bound SBD wraps around the MH2, forming an extended structure comprised of a proline-rich rigid coil region, an α-helix, and a β-strand. These three structural elements bind extensive hydrophobic grooves on the MH2 covering ∼2600 Å2. The extended structure of the SBD in complex with MH2 suggests that the unbound SBD is disordered in solution or that it undergoes an unfolding transition before interaction with the MH2. Although the prevailing paradigm had been that proteins must form folded structures to function, the relevance of protein disorder in biological systems has been recognized recently (28Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Using a neural network program to identify disordered regions on the basis of protein primary sequence, 35–51% of eukaryotic proteins are estimated to have disordered regions of 40 residues or more (29Dunker A.K. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradovic Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Disordered protein regions are thought to play roles in the regulation of many protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. In many cases disordered or partially ordered proteins undergo folding transitions during target recognition. Examples include GCN4 (30Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), LEF1 (31, Love, J. J. (1999) Biophysical Characterization of the HMG-1 Box Domain of the Lymphoid Enhancer Binding Factor-1. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, San DiegoGoogle Scholar), and bacteriophage λ protein N (32Mogridge J. Legault P. Li J. Van Oene M.D. Kay L.E. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In another case, folding induced by phosphorylation is thought to control the interaction between the kinase-inducible activation domain of CREB and the KIX domain of CREB-binding protein (33Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Disordered regions have been postulated to function in thermodynamic fine-tuning, plasticity, and control of protein interactions (28Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural requirements of a MH2-interacting partner, we have examined the structure of the unbound SBD of SARA, compared it to the bound form, and probed the binding of MH2 and SBD. NMR analysis indicates that the unbound SBD is highly disordered, allowing the SBD to make extensive contacts with the MH2. Individual contacts provide low binding affinity; however, together these interactions provide a substantial free energy of interaction. No region of the SBD appears to make a dominant contribution to the interaction between the SBD and MH2. These results indicate that the disorder of the SBD facilitates an interaction with the MH2 and suggest a binding mechanism that enables the MH2 to recognize a diverse group of disordered regions. Disorder Prediction—Disorder predictions were made using the neural network program PONDR (Predictor Of Native Disordered Regions; Molecular Kinetics), which predicts probable disordered regions of proteins based on their primary sequence (34, Romero, P., Obradovic, Z., Kissinger, C. R., Villafranca, J. E., and Dunker, A. K. (1997) Proc. I.E.E.E. International Conference on Neural Networks 1, 90–95Google Scholar, 35Li X. Romero P. Rani M. Dunker A.K. Obradovic Z. Genome Informat. 1999; 10: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically we used the VLXT predictor (www.pondr.com/background.html). Protein and Peptide Preparation—Initially SBD was purified using a non-denaturing purification protocol. SARA-SBD (amino acids 663–751) was amplified using PCR and cloned into pRSETB, a His-tag vector, using the NheI and XhoI restriction sites. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells, then purified using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) in a solution of 20 mm imidazole, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted using 50 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After concentration, the protein was purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in 75 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The construct severely affected the growth rate of the bacteria, and yield from the purification was less than 1 mg/liter in minimal medium. HSQC NMR spectra were recorded on 1H,15N-labeled sample in two different buffers, one containing 420 mm NaCl and 50 mm NaHPO4, pH 6.0, and one containing only 100 mm NaHPO4, pH 6.0. These spectra were recorded at 5, 10, and 25 °C. Because of poor yield from this construct we began using a denaturing purification with a different construct after establishing that the SBD is disordered (as described under “Results”). SARA-SBD (amino acids 663–721) was amplified using PCR, cloned into pGEX 4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) using the BamH1 and XhoI restriction sites, and confirmed by sequencing. The last 30 residues of the previous construct were not included in this construct, as these residues are not involved in the interaction with the Smad2 MH2 domains (26Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The GST-SBD fusion was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells at 30 °C for 4 h. A 1H,15N,13C-labeled SBD sample was prepared by expressing the protein in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter [15N]NH4Cl and 3 g/liter [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Similarly, a 2H,15N-labeled sample was prepared by expressing the protein in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride and 99.9% D2O. For the D2O growth only, 2 liters of M9 were inoculated with E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pGEX 4T1 SBD to an OD600 of 0.17. This was grown at 37 °C until an OD of 0.5 was reached (∼4.5 h), then the temperature was lowered to 30 °C over a 1-h period followed by induction with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and harvest after an additional 5 h. Cells from all SBD growths were lysed by sonication in a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). SBD was cleaved from GST using thrombin and purified on a C4 HPLC column (Phenonmenex) using an acetonitrile gradient. The yield of the final product was 2 mg/liter of minimal medium. There were no significant changes in the HSQC spectra of SBD purified using this denaturing purification when compared with SBD purified using the native purification except for the absence of peaks corresponding to the additional residues in the Histagged SBD. Identity of the protein and isotope labeling efficiency were confirmed by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. A pET3d Smad2 MH2 construct was a gift from Yigong Shi (Princeton University). MH2 was cotransformed with the Magic Plasmid, a gift from Cheryl Arrowsmith (University of Toronto), into BL21(DE3) cells. The Magic Plasmid contains tRNA genes for codons that are rare in E. coli. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, the protein was expressed for 16 h at 25 °C, harvested, and purified immediately. Cells were lysed in 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and purified on a Mono S fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) using a NaCl gradient. The collected fraction was then purified on a phenyl-Superose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted from the column using 50 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.4, 5% ethanol. The protein was concentrated using MacroSep centrifugal concentrators (Pall Filtron). Protein quantification was carried out using the method of Gill and von Hippel (36Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Peptides used in binding studies corresponding to the SBD rigid coil (SSQSPNPNNPAEYC), α-helix (STIPPLQQAQASGAL), and β-strand (SSPPPTVMVPVGV) regions were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified using a C4 HPLC column (Phenomenex). Peptide identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Peptide quantity was determined by amino acid analysis. NMR Spectroscopy—Assignment experiments were performed at 10 °C on a Varian INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a pulsed field gradient unit and a triple resonance probe. NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using nmrPipe/nmrDraw (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data were collected using NOESY-HSQC (45Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Shortle D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) at 500 MHz on a 1H,15N,13C-labeled sample with a mixing time of 150 ms. HSQC-NOESY-HSQC (46Ikura M. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9020-9022Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were recorded on a Varian Inova 800 MHz spectrometer at 10 °C with mixing times of 150 and 600 ms on a 15N sample that was deuterated at all non-exchangeable positions. Assignment of resonances from both major and minor conformers corresponding to proline isomers was completed by traditional backbone assignment methods (47Leopold M.F. Urbauer J.L. Wand A.J. Mol. Biotechnol. 1994; 2: 61-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The presence of a cis peptide bond was confirmed by the proline carbon side-chain resonance frequencies (48Dorman D.E. Bovery F.A. J. Org. Chem. 1973; 38: 2379-2383Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 49Grathwohl C. Wuthrich K. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 2025-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Proline isomer ratios were measured by comparing well resolved peak volumes in the HBCBCACONNH and HSQC using PIPP. We did not account for possible differences in magnetization transfer rates in these experiments. The hydrodynamic radius of SBD was measured using pulsed field gradient diffusion experiments (50Gibbs S.J. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 395-402Google Scholar, 51Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The diffusion rate of the SBD was measured and compared with an internal standard, dioxane, a molecule of known size, to determine the hydrodynamic radius of the SBD. Fluorescence Binding Studies—Fluorescence binding experiments were carried out at 16 °C using an AVIV Ratio spectrofluorometer model ATF105 and a Microlab 500 Series automated titrator. Smad2 MH2 protein was extensively dialyzed into a filtered and argon-purged buffer containing 50 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% ethanol. Fluorescence levels were monitored as peptide was added to the MH2 sample using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 350 nm. Data were fit to the equation, F=(−(−Fmax(A+B+Kd))−(−Fmax(A+B+Kd))2−4AB(Fmax)2)+2A(Eq. 1) where A is the total MH2 protein, B is the total ligand added, Kd is the dissociation constant, F is the fluorescence, and Fmax is the fluorescence maximum. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusions with truncated and mutant SBDs were amplified using PCR, cloned into pGEX 4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) using the BamH1 and XhoI restriction sites, and confirmed by sequencing. GST fusion constructs included SBD (amino acids 669–705), ΔRigid coil (amino acids 677–705), which is missing a portion of the rigid coil region, and Δβ-strand (amino acids 669–694), which is missing the β-strand region. Additionally, several SBD fusions were generated with chimeric or mutant α-helix regions. The mutations in these constructs are shown in Table III. GST-SBD fusions were overexpressed in E. coli DH5α in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an OD600 of 0.7 at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced with the addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 5 h. The bacterial pellet was lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, pepstatin (0.01 mg/ml), leupeptin (0.01 mg ml), antipain (0.01 mg/ml), benzamidine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml), and 0.5% Triton X-100. After clearing by centrifugation the lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B Resin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, after which the resin was washed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton. The purified proteins were subsequently incubated with 293T cell lysates expressing FLAG-tagged Smad2 for 1 h then washed with a buffer solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton. Protein complexes were released from GST resin by boiling in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Bound FLAG-Smad2 was visualized with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences).Table IIIInteraction of SARA SBD mutants with Smad2 MH2 Open table in a new tab Analysis of MH2-interacting Regions—Because many modular binding domains bind to a recognizable sequence motif, we attempted to identify a consensus target motif for the Smad2 MH2 domain. To this end we tried to align the regions that have been shown to be necessary for interaction with Smad2 MH2 from seven different proteins. Because of the unrelated nature of the sequences, no meaningful alignment was possible; inspection of these regions (Fig. 1a) reveals that, although it is possible to identify similarities between pairs of sequences, there is no universal MH2 interaction motif. One previously identified pairwise similarity is the Smad interaction motif (SIM) (52Randall R.A. Germain S. Inman G.J. Bates P.A. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), shown in red (Fig. 1). The SIM has the sequence PNxxxxxahxxxIPPh (where a is an acidic residue, h is a hydrophobic residue, and x is any residue) and is shared by SARA and a subset of the Mixer family of transcription factors and partially shared by FoxH1. The Mixer SIM, like the SARA SBD, is sufficient for an interaction with the MH2 domains of Smad2 and 3 and likely occupies some of the same binding sites since they compete for binding to MH2. Several of these residues including Pro-672, Tyr-680, Pro-686, and Leu-687 of SARA were shown to contact the surface of Smad2 MH2 (Fig. 1b). However, Asn-673, Glu-679, Ile-684, and Pro-685 do not contact the MH2 surface. Significantly, Mixer residues Asn-293 and Pro-305, which align with Asn-673 and Pro-685 in SARA, are required for a high affinity interaction with MH2, as mutations at these positions significantly decrease the ability of Mixer to interact with the MH2 (52Randall R.A. Germain S. Inman G.J. Bates P.A. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the SIM does not fit the definition of a sequence recognition motif per se, since not all of the residues bind to the MH2. One possibility is that the Mixer SIM and SARA SIM bind in different conformations. Alternatively, they bind in the same conformation, and those residues that do not contact the MH2 surface yet are required for a high affinity interaction are involved in maintaining structural features of the SIM, which make it amenable to interacting with the MH2. SARA SBD Is Natively Disordered—Because the affinity of an interaction between two proteins is dependent on the difference in energy between the bound state and the free state, we decided to investigate the unbound SBD to increase our understanding of the interaction between the MH2 and SARA SBD. Previous studies have shown that the SBD interacts with the MH2 in an extended conformation and does not form its own hydrophobic core. Therefore, the SBD must either undergo an unfolding transition before binding or exist in solution as a disordered region. An analysis of the sequence of the SBD using the program PONDR was used to assess whether the SBD has a propensity to be natively disordered (35Li X. Romero P. Rani M. Dunker A.K. Obradovic Z. Genome Informat. 1999; 10: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar). PONDR is a neural network program trained on a data base of disordered proteins and used to predict disordered regions of proteins based on their primary sequence. Disordered regions are correctly identified with 79% accuracy for stretches of 21 amino acids or longer. PONDR gives a convincing, uninterrupted prediction of disorder for the entire SBD (Fig. 1c). Consistent with this, the SBD sequence is of low complexity and is enriched in amino acid types thought to be disorder-promoting including nine Pro, seven Ser, four Ala, and four Gln residues and has a paucity of residues thought to be order-promoting such as Trp, Phe, Ile, and Leu (53Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). PONDR was also used to predict the propensity of other Smad2-interacting regions to be disordered (Fig. 1c). Although both Mixer and FoxH1 are expected to bind to the MH2 in an extended conformation similar to the SARA interaction (52Randall R.A. Germain S. Inman G.J. Bates P.A. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), neither Mixer nor FoxH1 SIMs are predicted to have significant lengths of disorder by PONDR. Although the SIMs might still be disordered, these results raise the possibility that they undergo an unfolding transition before binding to the MH2. Significantly, three of the other MH2-interacting regions of the partners TGIF, CBP, and AML1 are predicted to have disordered regions of 20 residues in length or more in the region that interacts with the MH2. Thus, the sequence comparison data and PONDR predictions suggest that the MH2 may have some propensity for binding to natively disordered or unfolded regions of interacting proteins. NMR is an extremely useful tool for investigating disordered states. Its uses include but are not restricted to determining whether a protein is disordered, probing for elements of secondary structure, detection of long range interactions, and measuring hydrodynamic properties. We have used NMR approaches to determine experimentally whether SARA SBD is disordered and to further probe its structural properties. In disordered or unfolded proteins the amide protons are mostly solvent-exposed and experience a similar chemical environment, unlike amide protons in folded proteins. As a result they resonate in a narrow range between 8.0 and 8.8 ppm. The proton-nitrogen (1H,15N) HSQC spectrum of SARA SBD revealed a narrow range of amide proton chemical shifts characteristic of disordered proteins ("

G., Maurer, K. W., Roe, D. C., Stauber, M. J., Eargle, D., Ewing, T. J., Muscate, A., Davioud-Charvet, E., Medaglia, M. V., Fisher, R. J., Arnold, E., Gao, H. Q., Buckheit, R., Boyer, P. L., Hughes, S. H., Kuntz, I. D., and Kenyon, G. L. (2002) Bioorg. Chem. 30, 443–458). We have investigated the mechanism by which KM-1 inhibits wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT by using pre-steady state kinetic methods to examine the effect of KM-1 on the parameters governing the single nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by RT. Analysis of the pre-steady-state burst phase of dATP incorporation showed that KM-1 decreased the amplitude of the reaction as previously shown for other NNRTIs, because of the slow equilibration of the inhibitor with RT. In the ternary enzyme-DNA-KM-1 complex (E-DNA-I), incorporation of the next nucleotide onto the primer is blocked. However, unlike conventional NNRTIs, the inhibitory effect was caused primarily by weakening the DNA binding affinity and displacing DNA from the enzyme. Wild-type RT binds a 25/45-mer DNA duplex with an apparent Kd of 3 nm, which was increased to 400 nm upon saturation with KM-1. Likewise, the apparent Kd for KM-1 binding to RT increased at higher DNA concentrations. We therefore conclude that KM-1 represents a new class of inhibitor distinct from nevirapine and related NNRTIs. KM-1 can bind to RT in both the absence and presence of DNA but weakens the affinity for DNA 140-fold so that it favors DNA dissociation. The data suggest that KM-1 distorts RT conformation and misaligns DNA at the active site. 2-Naphthalenesulfonic acid (4-hydroxy-7-[[[[5-hydroxy-6-[(4 cinnamylphenyl)azo]-7-sulfo-2-naphthalenyl]amino]-carbonyl]amino]-3-[(4-cinnamylphenyl)]azo (KM-1)) is a novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that was designed to bind at an unconventional site on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) (Skillman, A.

However, the rate of infection is still on the rise (2Piot P. Science. 1998; 280: 1844-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the current antiviral drugs do not eliminate HIV infection, and the high rate of mutation of the virus leads to rapid emergence of new variants of HIV resistant to each class of drugs (3Balzarini J.

Thus, current treatments call for the frequent screening to look for increases in viral load indicative of new drug-resistant forms of the virus, which must be countered by a new combination of drugs. The current strategy for drug design is to address the changes in HIV by developing new drugs with a different resistance pattern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the properties of a new series of compounds to quantitatively evaluate their potency and to examine their mechanism of inhibition of HIV RT. RT is responsible for replication of single-stranded viral RNA into double-stranded DNA, which is subsequently integrated into the host cellular DNA during the course of viral infection (9Goff S.P. J. Acquir. Immune. Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1990; 3: 817-831Google Scholar). Two types of anti-HIV medications target RT: the nucleoside analog RT inhibitors and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). Nucleoside analog RT inhibitors, such as 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine and 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine, are nucleosides that become phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to their triphosphate form and are then incorporated by RT, acting as chain terminators to prevent further polymerization. To varying degrees, they also block cellular DNA polymerases, in particular the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ) (10Johnson A.A. Ray A.S. Hanes J. Suo Z.C. Colacino J.M. Anderson K.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40847-40857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and their kinetics of incorporation are correlated with the toxic side effects of these drugs (reviewed in Ref. 11Lee H. Hanes J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). NNRTIs are structurally diverse hydrophobic compounds that show fewer toxic side effects, but they are predominantly effective toward HIV-1 RT and not HIV-2 RT (12De Clercq E. Med. Res. Rev. 1993; 13: 229-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). NNRTIs bind in a hydrophobic pocket ∼10 Å away from the RT polymerase active site in the palm domain of the p66 subunit and distort the key residues that comprise the aspartic triad (D110, D185, and D186) so that the carboxyl groups of the side chains are out of alignment leading to slower rates of catalysis (13Kohlstaedt L.A.

Spence et al. (15Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) showed that the first generation NNRTIs, nevirapine and tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione, are allosteric, slow-tight binding inhibitors that reduce the rate of the chemical reaction and increase the affinity of nucleotide binding to the inhibitor and DNA-bound RT (E-D-I) complex. As a result of a slower chemical reaction, the two steps of nucleotide binding entailing the initial ground-state binding and the subsequent conformational change reach equilibrium leading to tighter, albeit non-productive nucleotide binding. The biggest barrier in the battle against AIDS is mutation, which confers resistance toward RT inhibitors. Drug-resistant RT mutants have been proposed to obstruct the binding of the drug (16Tramontano E. Piras G. Mellors J.W. Putzolu M. Bazmi H.Z. La Colla P. Biochem.

Therefore, new distinct drugs are required to counter the rapid RT evolution. Herein, we report the kinetic analysis of a new class of NNRTIs selected and designed initially by computational structure-based design (Fig. 1) (28Skillman A.G. Maurer K.W. Roe D.C. Stauber M.J. Eargle D. Ewing T.J. Muscate A. Davioud-Charvet E. Medaglia M.V. Fisher R.J. Arnold E. Gao H.Q. Buckheit R. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Bioorg. Chem. 2002; 30: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Compared with two other derivatives with modified terminal moieties, KM-1 was predicted to be the most potent and the least toxic based upon results from cell culture screening and preliminary activity assays (28Skillman A.G. Maurer K.W. Roe D.C. Stauber M.J. Eargle D. Ewing T.J. Muscate A. Davioud-Charvet E. Medaglia M.V. Fisher R.J. Arnold E. Gao H.Q. Buckheit R. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Bioorg. Chem. 2002; 30: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further investigation into the mechanism of inhibition by KM-1 is essential for the assessment of its potential as a new class of inhibitors of HIV RT. Our data revealed that, unlike other NNRTIs, KM-1 interfered with template-primer binding. We propose that KM-1 binds to RT with or without DNA and precludes proper alignment of DNA at the polymerase active site, depleting the active DNA-bound RT (E-D) complex required for nucleotide incorporation. KM-1 is similar to other NNRTIs in that each seems to slow the rate of catalysis in the E-D-I complex by binding to a site adjacent to the catalytic site. However, it also weakens the binding of DNA, whereas conventional NNRTIs are thought to strengthen DNA binding by slowing the DNA dissociation rate from the closed complex formed after the binding of the next correct nucleotide (15Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. Bacterial expression cell lines, dATP, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and kinase buffer were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences. The non-nucleoside inhibitors were synthesized as described previously (28Skillman A.G. Maurer K.W. Roe D.C. Stauber M.J. Eargle D. Ewing T.J. Muscate A. Davioud-Charvet E. Medaglia M.V. Fisher R.J. Arnold E. Gao H.Q. Buckheit R. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Kuntz I.D. Kenyon G.L. Bioorg. Chem. 2002; 30: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The P-11 resin for the phosphocellulose column and filter paper and discs were purchased from Whatman (Chilton, NJ). The Sepharose resin was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The non-nucleoside inhibitors were dissolved and stored in Me2SO at –20 °C and diluted by at least 700-fold to a stock solution with water. Controlled experiments verified that the final concentrations of Me2SO did not affect the measured kinetic rates. Buffers—All experiments were carried out at 37 °C. RT was incubated with DNA in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1–1 mg/ml BSA. Nucleotides (such as dATP) were diluted into the same buffer with 4 mm magnesium acetate. Protein Expression and Purification—Transformed DH5α cells producing the p66 and p51 subunits were grown separately in Lennox L broth supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C. When the optical density reached 0.6, protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were then grown for 16 h at 37 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The crude cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. Based upon the gel-staining intensities of the bands corresponding to the p66 and the p51subunits, cell pellets of the large and small subunit were combined in a ratio of 3.9:1 to achieve a ratio of 1.25:1 at the end of the purification process. The procedures for purification of wild-type RT were described previously by Kati et al. (29Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stahlhut M. Li Y. Condra J.H. Fu J. Gotlib L. Graham D.J. Olsen D.B. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The concentration of RT was determined by absorbance at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 260,450 m–1 cm–1. Active enzyme concentration was measured by active site titration as described below. Synthetic Oligonucleotides—All experiments were performed with the same DNA duplex 25/45-bp as described by Kati et al. (29Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the next base coded for incorporation was dATP. The sequence of the 25-mer primer was GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA. The sequence of the 45-mer template was GGACGGCATTGGATCGAGGTTGAGTTGGTT GGACGGCTGCGAGGC. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of the oligonucleotides were determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Equimolar amounts of 25-mer and 45-mer were annealed by placing the solution in a heating block at 95 °C and then allowing the heating block to gradually cool to room temperature. 5′-32P Labeling of 25-bp Primer—Before annealing, the primer was 5′-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The kinase was denatured after 1 h by placing the reaction at 95 °C for 5 min. Un-reacted and contaminating nucleotides were removed from the labeled primer using a Micro Bio-Spin-30 column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The final concentration of labeled 25-mer was determined by thin layer chromatography of the samples taken before and after the MicroSpin column. Pre-steady-state Kinetics of Single Nucleotide Incorporation—Experiments were carried out at 37 °C in a KinTek RQF-3 rapid quench flow (www.kintek-corp.com). The experiments were initiated by mixing a pre-equilibrated complex of enzyme-DNA, in the absence or presence of inhibitor, with an excess of dATP (15 μl each), and quenched with 80 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. The reaction sample was collected into a microcentrifuge tube containing 30 μl of polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. We will refer to the concentrations of all reactants after 1-to-1 mixing in the quench-flow instrument. Product Analysis—We quantified the extension of 5′-labeled 25-mer to 26-mer. Products were resolved on a denaturing gel (15% polyacrylamide, 0.8% bis-acrylamide, 7 m urea). The dried gel was exposed to a phosphor-screen then scanned with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software. Data Analysis—Data were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program GraFit 5.0.1 (Erithacus Software). Data points from the presteady-state burst experiments were fitted to the burst equation y = A × (1 – e–kt) + m × t, where y represents the concentration of the 26-mer product, A is the burst amplitude, k is the observed burst rate, m is the slope of the linear steady-state phase, and t the reaction time. The steady state rate was calculated by dividing the slope by the concentration of active enzyme. The observed burst rates were plotted against nucleotide (dATP) concentration and fitted to a hyperbolic equation, y = (kmax × S)/(Kd + S), where kmax represents the maximum incorporation rate, Kd the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the nucleotide, and S the concentration of nucleotide. For single nucleotide incorporation experiments done in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor, the plot of the amplitude of each time course as a function of inhibitor concentration was fitted to a hyperbolic equation, y = E – [(E × I)/(Kd + I)] + B, where y represents the amplitude, E is the total enzyme concentration, I is the total inhibitor concentration, B is the background signal, and Kd is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the non-nucleoside inhibitor. Titration of Active Enzyme with DNA—The concentration of active enzyme and the Kd for DNA in the presence of different concentrations of the inhibitor were determined by an active site titration experiment as described previously (29Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT was added to increasing concentrations of 5′-32P-labeled 25/45-mer DNA, in the presence or absence of inhibitor and incubated for 5 min. The sample was then mixed with an equal volume of dATP (100 μm) for 0.5 s and then quenched with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8. The amplitudes were obtained by fitting each time course to the burst equation. The amplitudes were then plotted as a function of DNA concentration. The results from experiments done in the absence of the inhibitor were fitted with a quadratic equation, A=[(Kd+E+D×F)−(Kd+E+D×F)2−4×E×D×F]/2, where A is the amplitude, E is the total enzyme concentration, D is the total DNA concentration, Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for DNA, and F is the binding factor. The binding factor is the fraction of E-D complexes that are productively bound. It corrects for the actual concentration of DNA in productive E-D complexes because the data from DNA titration experiments showed that both inactive and active enzymes were bound to DNA. The maximum amplitude obtained was ∼50% of the protein concentration determined by the UV absorbance measurements at 280 nm. All enzyme concentrations reported here are calibrated via active site titration. The results from DNA titration experiments done in the presence of the inhibitor were fitted with a hyperbolic equation, y = [(E × I)/(Kd + I)] + B, where y represents the amplitude, D is the total DNA concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the inhibitor. TK Solver 4.0 (Universal Technical Systems, Inc.) was also used to estimate the equilibrium dissociation constant for KM-1 binding to E-D complex and free enzyme. Numerical estimates were entered to solve for seven equations simultaneously. The Kd values calculated by TK Solver were used to simulate data, which were overlaid with the experimental data for validation. When measuring the apparent binding rate of KM-1, normalized product formation as a function of time was fitted to an exponential decay equation, where [P]normalized = A × e–kobs ×t + C. A represents the amplitude, kobs is the apparent binding rate constant, t is the time, and C is the background signal. Association and dissociation rates for formation of the E-D-I complex were obtained by analysis of the KM-1 concentration dependence of the observed rate of binding as in the function, kobs = kon × [I] + koff. An independent estimate of koff was not possible because of the large errors in the extrapolated intercept; therefore, the binding rate was calculated by fitting the data to the equation, kobs = kon × ([I] + Kd), such that koff was constrained to agree with both the Kd value and the observed binding rate. Static Light Scattering—Inhibitor stock solutions at 14 mm in Me2SO were diluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer. The buffer was filtered with 0.02 μm Anodisc 47. All samples were analyzed with mini-DAWN triple-angle light scattering detector for ambient high performance liquid chromatography from Wyatt Technology Corporation (Santa Barbara, CA). A neon-helium ion laser at 632 nm was used. The laser power and integration times were comparable for all experiments. The detector angle was 90°. Each sample was measured three or more times at room temperature. Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Fluorescence Polarization Anisotropy— Stock solutions of DNA and KM-1 were diluted in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA). KM-1 is naturally fluorescent. The fluorescence intensities were measured with QuantaMaster (QM-1) spectrofluorometer from Photon Technology International (Lawrenceville, NJ). Each sample volume was 100 μl. The emission wavelength scan was obtained by exciting at 352 nm and emitting from 365–650 nm. The excitation scan was obtained by examining emission at 440 nm, exciting from 250–425 nm. The polarization angles for both the excitation and emission linear polarizing filters were set at 0° and 90° to obtain four sets of fluorescence intensity data. The signals from horizontal and vertical polarization were respectively denoted as Ivv (0° excitation; 0° emission), Ivh (0° excitation; 90° emission), Ihh (90° excitation; 90° emission), and Ihv (90° excitation; 0° emission). The anisotropy (r) value was calculated as r = (Ivv × Ihh – Ihv × Ivh)/(Ivv × Ihh + 2 × Ihv × Ivh). The anisotropy value was plotted against DNA concentration to check for signs of interaction (31Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Solutions were prepared at final concentrations of 20, 50, 250, and 500 μm KM-1 in double-distilled water. At room temperature, 5 μl of each solution was placed onto a carbon-coated grid from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA) for 30 s. The grid was then blotted on filter paper to remove excess solution, washed three times with water, and negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 s, blotted, and air dried. Images were obtained with a transmission electron microscope (Philips TEM 208) at 80 kV. Micrographs were recorded at 44,000× magnification. Dose-dependent Inhibition of Single Nucleotide Incorporation by KM-1—We first examined the effect of KM-1 on the pre-steady state burst of single nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by HIV RT with a defined primer/template. In this experiment, the burst rate provides a direct measurement of the rate of polymerization at the active site and the amplitude defines the concentration of reactive enzyme-DNA (E-D) complexes, whereas steady state turnover is limited by the release of product DNA from enzyme (29Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Johnson K.A. Transient-State Kinetic Analysis of Enzyme Reaction Pathways. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 1-61Google Scholar). We incubated the E-D complex with 0–20 μm inhibitor before mixing with Mg2+·dATP to start the reaction. The results in Fig. 2A show an initial burst of polymerization followed by a slow steady-state turnover. In the absence of KM-1, the burst amplitude for dATP incorporation catalyzed by 50 nm RT (with 100 nm DNA) was 43 ± 2 nm, the burst rate was 7.4 ± 0.9 s–1, and the steady state rate was 0.20 ± 0.03 s–1. Increasing the inhibitor concentration reduced the amplitude of the burst phase as well as the rate of the linear steady state phase to almost zero (Figs. 2A and 3A) but did not affect the burst rates. Reduction in the amplitude is presumably caused by the binding of KM-1 to E-D and/or E in a reaction that equilibrates slowly relative to the rate of the burst (15Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The reduction in burst amplitude but not rate is consistent with the slow equilibration of the inhibitor so that the observed amplitude reflects only the reaction catalyzed by uninhibited enzyme. Therefore, plotting the amplitude of the burst as function of inhibitor concentration provides a direct titration to quantify inhibitor binding as shown in Fig. 2B. Fitting the curve to a hyperbolic function defines an apparent Kd of 1.3 ± 0.2 μm for the binding of KM-1 to the enzyme.Fig. 3DNA-directed single nucleotide incorporation in the presence of KM-1 with a ratio of RT to DNA concentration at 1:3. A, wild-type RT (100 nm), 5′-32P-labeled 25/45-mer DNA (300 nm), and various concentrations of KM-1 were preincubated for 15–20 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). Concentrations of 0 (○),1(•),2(□),4(▪),6(▵),8(▴), 12 (⋄), and 20 (♦) μm KM-1 were included in the initial solution in which the equilibrium between E-D and E-D-I complexes was established. The E-D complex was diluted by one half when mixed rapidly with an equal volume of 150 μm dATP (in 4 mm MgCl2) and allowed to react for 0.01–5 s. The reactions were quenched with EDTA at the indicated time points. The individual time course of primer extension at each KM-1 concentration was fitted to the burst equation to obtain the amplitude for each burst curve. B, the amplitudes of the burst phases were plotted against the KM-1 concentrations. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation to define a Kd value of 3.4 ± 1.0 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar effects on the burst amplitude and steady state rates observed with EDC 11 and EDC 12 suggest identical inhibition mechanisms as KM-1. The modified moieties in EDC 11 and 12 (Fig. 1) affect the binding affinities to HIV-1 RT only slightly. The hyperbolic function of amplitude versus inhibitor concentration defined the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for EDC-11 and EDC-12 of 1.9 ± 0.4 and 1.5 ± 0.6 μm, respectively. Two modes of action were possible for this series of inhibitors. The reduction of burst amplitude with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor suggests that they can act like conventional NNRTIs and inhibit the chemistry step of polymerization pathway by binding to the E-D complex. On the other hand, they could bind to the free enzyme and prevent productive binding of DNA to HIV-1 RT. Their structural resemblance to DNA base pairs suggests possible competition between DNA and the inhibitor for binding to HIV-1 RT. To examine whether KM-1 acted by competing with DNA binding, we repeated the titration of the reaction amplitude versus KM-1 concentration in th"
https://openalex.org/W2138386958,"Oxidative stress is one of the major causes of cell death. Using time-lapse confocal recording of live cardiomyocytes, we showed that H2O2 (OH*) caused a marked increase in Na+ and Ca2+ levels in both the cytosol ([Na]cyt, [Ca]cyt) and mitochondria ([Na]m, [Ca]m). The H2O2-induced intracellular Na+ ([Na]i) overload contributed to the H2O2-induced [Ca]cyt/[Ca]m overload via activation of the reverse mode of the Na-Ca exchanger. When myocytes were treated for 40 min with 100 microM H2O2 in normal medium, then returned to H2O2-free medium, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased from 4% at 0 h to 55 and 85% at 4.5 and 16 h, respectively. H2O2-induced apoptosis was completely prevented by using Na-free, but not Ca-free, medium. When a Na+ ionophore cocktail in Ca-free medium was used instead of H2O2 to increase the [Na]i by more than 30 mM without any change in the [Ca]i, cytochrome c release and caspase 3-dependent apoptosis occurred, showing that [Na]i overload per se induced apoptosis. We also showed that the increase in the mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic, Na+ levels resulted in the opening of the permeation transition pore, followed by cytochrome c release. Our findings therefore suggest that H2O2-induced [Na]m overload is an important upstream signal for the apoptotic machinery, and the prevention of [Na]m overload thus represents a particularly attractive target for strategies aimed at preventing oxidative stress-induced cell death."
