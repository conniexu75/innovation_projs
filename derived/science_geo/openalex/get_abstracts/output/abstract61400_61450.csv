https://openalex.org/W2070257148,"Isospora-type oocysts were excreted by cats following the ingestion of Toxoplasma fromn infected mice. Oocysts appeared 3 to 5 days after cyst. were ingested and 8 to 10 days after trophozoites were ingested, and also 21 to 24 days after the administration of infective fecal suspensions from cats. A close quanititative and biologic correlation between oocysts and Toxoplasma infectivity of the feces was observed which could not be separated by density gradient centrifugation and filtration methods. Toxoplasma is an intestinal coccidian of cats which is fecally spread. It has evolved to multiply in brain and muscle and in other species, making it possible for carnivorism to become another means of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1533371932,Abstract Double stranded DNA serves as a template primer for Escherichia coli DNA polymerase when the DNA contains a single strand break (a nick) with a 3'-hydroxyl terminus. Initiation of replication entails covalent extension of the 3'-hydroxyl terminus and a concurrent 5' → 3' nuclease action by the enzyme. The primer strand is hydrolyzed at the 5' side of the nick while the synthetic activity catalyzes the addition of nucleotides to the 3' side. The ability of the enzyme to promote hydrolysis and synthesis simultaneously results in the translation of the nick along the DNA duplex in the 5' to 3' direction. The mechanism for conserving the 5'-strand and providing net synthesis of DNA in later phases of the reaction has not yet been clarified.

https://openalex.org/W1533310140,"Abstract 5-Methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate - homocysteine transmethylase has been purified from a methionine auxotroph of Escherichia coli K12, which was derepressed for the enzyme. The purified transmethylase has been crystallized and appears to be nearly homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis and by equilibrium and velocity ultracentrifugation. Further evidence for a high degree of purity has been obtained from a dual purification of the enzyme from repressed and derepressed cells. A calculation of the specific activity of pure enzyme from the initial and final specific activities of derepressed and repressed enzymes reveals that the purified derepressed enzyme is at least 94% pure. Since the transmethylase appears nearly homogeneous after only a 20-fold purification, the enzyme must represent 5% of the soluble protein in derepressed cells of E. coli and 3% in wild type cells. The catalytic, physical, and chemical properties of the purified transmethylase have been investigated. The formation of methyl-14C-methionine from 5-methyl-14C-tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate is dependent on transmethylase, homocysteine, and Pi and is stimulated by Mg+2. 5-Methyl14C-tetrahydropteroylglutamate or 5-methyl-14C-tetrahydropteroyl-α-glutamylglutamate cannot replace the triglutamate folate derivative as methyl donor in the formation of methionine. The formation of methionine is inhibited by high ionic strength, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and the folate substrate analogues pteroyl-α-glutamylglutamic acid, pteroyl-γ-glutamyl-γ-glutamylglutamic acid, and 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl-α-glutamylglutamate. The transmethylase has a molecular weight of 84,000 and appears to be composed of subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1507949406,"Abstract A novel deoxyribonuclease, which requires the presence of nucleotide for the reaction, has been purified approximately 2300-fold from cell-free extracts of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. This enzyme degrades native, double-stranded DNA at about 40-fold greater rate than thermally denatured DNA. Evidence for complete dependence on ATP as well as Mg++ ion has been found. The optimum pH is around 9.4. The enzyme behaves as an endonuclease, yielding primarily oligonucleotides consisted of di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotides along with some larger fragments terminated by 5'-phosphoryl group. The average chain length of a limit digest is approximately 5.5. The rate of decrease in viscosity of the DNA substrate relative to the appearance of an acid-soluble form is not so rapid with this enzyme as that observed with pancreatic DNase. The kinetic analysis by means of sedimentation in sucrose density gradient indicates clearly that initial DNA added as substrate disappears progressively during the reaction with the enzyme, being replaced by much more slowly sedimenting material, and the products intermediate in size between these two components are not detectable. These results suggest that the mechanism of DNA digestion by the enzyme appears to be the one-by-one type."

https://openalex.org/W1520413605,"Abstract Mung bean I is highly preferential for single stranded (denatured) DNA; the numerical value of this preference depends on the type of DNA and the reaction conditions; at 37° in the absence of Mg2+ it is 30,000-fold for T4 DNA, 65-fold for crab d(A-T)n, and less than 2-fold for biosynthetic d(A-T)n. No detectable hydrolysis of poly dG·poly dC occurs under these conditions even with a 100-fold excess of enzyme. Addition of mm Mg2+ inhibits the hydrolysis of biosynthetic d(A-T)n 13-fold, but accelerates that of denatured DNA 2- to 3-fold. The temperature coefficient of the reaction in the range 27–37° is 5-fold higher for biosynthetic d(A-T)n than for crab d(A-T)n. With native biosynthetic d(A-T)n conditions exist under which the rate of hydrolysis approaches that of denatured DNA from other sources (T4, Escherichia coli, thymus). Therefore, mung bean I does not recognize biosynthetic d(A-T)n as a typically double stranded structure. DNA of λ phage which is known to contain an A,T-rich region in the center of the molecule is specifically attacked by mung bean I at this region. The most important properties of mung bean I are (a) its ability in low concentration to remove denatured DNA from a mixture of both forms, and (b) its ability in high concentration to cleave specifically A,T-rich regions of double stranded DNA. The name region-specific nuclease is suggested for a new class of enzymes exemplified by mung bean I."

https://openalex.org/W1523805473,"Abstract The over-all reaction catalyzed by RNA polymerase has been studied in discrete steps. These steps include (a) the binding of polymerase to DNA, (b) the binding of ribonucleoside triphosphates to RNA polymerase, (c) the initiation of RNA chains measured by 32PPi exchange reaction, and (d) the elongation of RNA chains as measured by nucleotides incorporation. A number of chemical reagents have been used to inactivate one or more of these four reactions selectively. In the presence of reagents which react with sulfhydryl groups, all the reactions except the binding of ribonucleoside triphosphates to the enzyme are quantitatively inactivated. Treatment of the enzyme with β-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid and chlorofluoro-p-benzoquinone results in preparations unable to bind ribonucleoside triphosphates and thus unable to initiate or elongate RNA chains. The ability of the enzyme to bind to DNA is unaffected by this treatment. In contrast to these reagents, diazo-1H-tetrazole and rose bengal (plus photooxidation) treatment of RNA polymerase results in enzyme preparations capable of binding DNA, binding ribonucleoside triphosphates, and catalyzing a rapid DNA-dependent 32PPi exchange reaction. However, such enzyme preparations are unable to elongate RNA chains. The properties of the chemically altered enzyme have been examined in the analytical ultracentrifuge. No marked alteration in the sedimentation values were obtained with reagents such as β-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid or diazo-1H-tetrazole. However, in the presence of p-chloromercuribenzoate, a small subunit of 2 S was dissociated from the enzyme. A study of the binding reaction between RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphates has been carried out. RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli will bind between 8 and 9 moles of nucleoside triphosphates per mole of enzyme (molecular weight, 340,000) and this reaction is stimulated by the addition of Mg2+ or Mn2+. In the absence of DNA the enzyme interacts identically with ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. The binding of 14C-ATP was displaced by an excess of unlabeled GTP or CTP, and the binding of 14C-GTP was completely displaced by an excess of unlabeled ATP or CTP. In the presence of DNA, the binding reaction between enzyme and nucleoside triphosphate is more restrictive. In the presence of thymus DNA, GTP and ATP are bound more preferentially by the enzyme while in the presence of the copolymer of deoxyadenylate and deoxythymidylate ATP is bound preferentially."

Similar results were obtained with free pyruvate dehydrogenase and with pyruvate dehydrogenase bound to dihydrolipoyl transacetylase. Inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase was accompanied by modification of 2 sulfhydryl groups per molecule of enzyme (mol wt 183,000). Inactivation of the enzyme by the mercurial did not affect its state of aggregation or its ability to combine with the transacetylase. Thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+ protected the enzyme against inactivation by the mercurial. Neither pyruvate nor Mg2+ was effective. In the presence of thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+, 2 —SH groups reacted with the mercurial without significant change in enzyme activity. Further treatment with the mercurial inactivated the enzyme and was accompanied by modification of 2 additional —SH groups. These results indicate that binding of thiamine pyrophosphate to the apoenzyme protected the two essential —SH groups and exposed, or enhanced the reactivity of, two nonessential —SH groups. The two essential —SH groups appear to be located either at the coenzyme binding sites or at other sites which, in turn, are modified by conversion of the apo- to the holoenzyme."

The arginyl-, valyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases from Salmonella are also inhibited by ADP and AMP. Reduced inhibition of a mutant histidyl-tRNA synthetase adds support to the idea that the greater inhibition of the wild type enzyme is not fortuitous, but is maintained to serve a physiological function. By affecting the activity of the various aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, energy charge could regulate the site of the charged tRNA pool and thus control the rate of protein synthesis."

Of nucleoside triphosphates tested, ATP and dATP are most effective, and dCTP is inactive, while other nucleoside triphosphates are relatively feeble. Nucleoside di- or monophosphates are inactive. At the low concentration of ATP the initial rate and final extent of DNA hydrolysis are proportional to the amount of ATP. The Km for ATP is 5.0 x 10-5 m, and the Km for dATP is the same as that for ATP. ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic orthophosphate during the process of DNA hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W1567741128,"Abstract Threonine deaminase (l-threonine hydrolyase deaminating, EC 4.2.1.16), molecular weight 194,000, was dissociated into stable intermediate substructures, molecular weight 94,000, by resolving the enzyme of its cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-monophosphate. The intermediate substructures were catalytically inactive and were found to be composed of two of the four identical polypeptide chains which constitute the native tetrameric enzyme. It was determined that the native enzyme contains two disulfide bonds and that these bonds are formed between the subunits of the apodimers. Addition of pyridoxal 5'-monophosphate to a mixture of the apodimers promotes a reassociation into a tetrameric form and a regain of enzymic activity. The reconstituted enzyme binds only 2 molecules of pyridoxal phosphate and its regulatory properties are the same as the native enzyme. The structure-function relationships with respect to the protomeric nature of this enzyme are discussed."

Brain tissue, however, induces transplantation immunity4 and histocompatibility antigens are detected in neurones of the cerebral cortex by immuno-fluorescence5. The selective localization of the specific fluorescence to the neurones can explain these conflicting results, for the number of stained cells represents only a small proportion of the total brain tissue.

https://openalex.org/W1523563825,"Abstract Using long chain 14C-β-hydroxyacyl derivatives of acyl carrier protein, the enzymatic incorporation of β-hydroxydecanoate, β-hydroxylaurate, and β-hydroxymyristate into a phospholipid has been demonstrated in Escherichia coli B. The enzymatic product was characterized as O-(1-β-hydroxyacyl-2-acyl-ns-glycero-3-phosphoryl)ethanolamine. Although initially particulate-bound, the acyl acyl carrier protein-phospholipid transferase activity was solubilized by sonic disruption. In addition, this procedure led to the separation of enzymatic activity from endogenous phospholipid acceptor. The enzymatic reaction exhibited an optimum magnesium concentration of 0.2 m and a pH optimum of 7.2 and was heat-labile. Added coenzyme A had no stimulatory effect. The radioactive product was identified by thin layer, silicic acid, diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and Sephadex LH-20 chromatography. On the basis of the same chromatographic criteria the structure of the acceptor was consistent with O-(2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl)ethanolamine. Treatment of the radioactive product with phospholipase A gave 14C-O-(1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl)ethanolamine with no concomitant release of radioactivity as free fatty acid. Treatment with phospholipase D yielded 14C-phosphatidic acid. Phospholipid acceptor was prepared from E. coli B grown on 32Pi-containing medium. The acceptor was isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and subsequently was acylated enzymatically with 14C-β-hydroxy fatty acids. The resulting 14C-32P-labeled product was isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of the acceptor yielded glycero-3-phosphate as the only 32P-containing product. Following deacylation of the doubly labeled product under alkaline conditions, all of the 32P was recovered as O-(3-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl)ethanolamine. Treatment of the 14C-32P product with phospholipase A yielded O-(1-β-hydroxyacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl)ethanolamine containing both 14C and 32P. Treatment with phospholipase D yielded 14C-32P-phosphatidic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1531625018,"Abstract Salts activate the fatty acid-synthesizing system of Escherichia coli and several of its component enzymes. The 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase from pig heart, one of the enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, is also stimulated by salts. Although all cations examined produce this stimulation, the activation patterns caused by monovalent cations are clearly distinct from those of divalent cations. When acyl carrier protein (ACP) and CoA thioesters are used as substrates, the activities of the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase and the enoyl-ACP reductase are stimulated by salts. However, there is no stimulation when N-acetylcysteamine thioesters serve as substrates. With the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase an increase of the salt concentration causes an increase in Vmax for both acetoacetyl-ACP and acetoacetyl-CoA and a decrease in Km only for acetoacetyl-ACP. The chromatographic behavior of ACP on Sephadex G-100 is influenced by salts. ACP interacts with MgSO4 to form complexes which elute in earlier fractions from Sephadex G-100 than salt-free ACP, although the molecular weight of the ACP is unchanged. When acetoacetyl-ACP, complexed with MgSO4, is used as substrate for the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, an increase of the salt concentration increases the Vmax for the reaction but has no effect on the Km for the acetoacetyl-ACP-MgSO4 complex. It is suggested that cations complex with the protein moiety of ACP substrates, thereby facilitating binding to the enzymes, and that cations increase reaction rates possibly by reducing the repulsion between the negatively charged groups of the substrates and their respective enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1499412575,"Abstract Binding studies of the 14C-folate substrate to the purified 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine transmethylase have been undertaken to elucidate the enzymatic mechanism of action. Investigations of the binding of dl5-methyl-14C-tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate to the transmethylase reveal that one isomer of the intact folate substrate is bound to the enzyme in a reversible reaction at 0° or 25°. Eighty per cent of the radioactivity in the isolated enzyme-14C complex is converted to methionine on the addition of homocysteine. The maximum amount of binding observed is equivalent to 0.76 mole of 5-methyl-14C-tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate per mole of enzyme. The dissociation equilibrium constant of the enzyme-substrate complex has been calculated to be 4.5 x 10-7m in Tris buffer, and there is 0.96 substrate-binding site per molecule of enzyme. Evidence is presented that the binding of the folate substrate to the transmethylase occurs at the catalytic site of the enzyme or at a site with similar characteristics. The substrate specificity of the binding reaction is also consistent with that of the catalytic reaction. 5-Methyl-14C-tetrahydropteroyl-α-glutamylglutamate binds to the transmethylase 13 times less effectively than the triglutamate substrate, and 5-methyl-14C-tetrahydropteroylglutamate binds less effectively than the α-diglutamate derivative of the substrate. Furthermore, it has been concluded that the simultaneous removal of the methyl group on nitrogen atom 5 and oxidation of the 5, 6, 7, and 8 positions of the 5-methyltetrahydropteridine ring do not affect the binding of a folate compound to the enzyme. It has also been determined that the pteroate acid and glutamate moieties are essential for the binding of a folate compound to the transmethylase."
https://openalex.org/W1552231151,"Abstract Binding of deacylated transfer RNA to Escherichia coli ribosomes at 5 mm magnesium has been studied and compared with the nonenzymatic binding of Phe-tRNA in the same system. Deacylated tRNA was labeled in the 3'-terminal dinucleotide. Different ribosomal preparations containing 70 S ribosomes but no subunits were investigated and optimal conditions were established. Binding of deacylated tRNA to ribosomes increased with increasing magnesium concentrations and differed from binding of aminoacylated tRNA which showed a pronounced maximum between 4 and 8 mm magnesium. Binding of deacylated tRNA was more labile than binding of aminoacylated tRNA. The former was rather insensitive to changes of temperature and incubation time, whereas binding of aminoacylated tRNA was critically dependent on both conditions and decreased at temperatures higher than 24° and upon longer incubation. KCl stimulated the nonenzymatic binding of aminoacylated tRNA. However, at higher temperatures and upon longer incubation, KCl caused a displacement of aminoacyl-tRNA from ribosomes. Binding of deacylated tRNA was always inhibited by KCl at concentrations higher than 20 mm and by magnesium at 5 mm. Both NaCl and LiCl showed an effect similar to that of KCl on the binding of Phe-tRNA: a stimulation of binding at low concentrations and an inhibition of binding at higher concentrations. Both monovalent ions inhibited binding of deacylated tRNA to ribosomes. This suggests that the order in which monovalent ions act on the binding of both tRNAs is similar, but that they differ with respect to the concentration. This order is the same as the order of their hydrated atomic radius."

https://openalex.org/W45414992,"Abstract Two pairs of strains that differ in the rel-1 locus were compared for their ability to synthesize protein, RNA, and lipid in the presence and absence of a required amino acid. In the absence of a required amino acid, protein synthesis ceased in both relaxed control (RCrel) and stringent control (RCstr) cells, and RNA synthesis ceased only in the RCstr cells. Lipid synthesis continued at an approximately equal rate in the presence or absence of a required amino acid in both RCrel and RCstr cells. Analysis of the lipid extracts showed a decrease in cardiolipin in RCrel cells deprived of a required amino acid. Otherwise, the distribution of the lipids was not affected by the absence of a required amino acid in either the RCrel or RCstr cells and was quite similar in both types of cells. The fatty acid distribution also appeared unaffected. These results are consistent with the view that the control of RNA synthesis exercised by the rel-1 locus cannot be simply at the level of nucleoside triphosphate availability."
