https://openalex.org/W4283360071,"Abstract The largest monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak described so far in non-endemic countries was identified in May 2022 (refs. 1–6 ). In this study, shotgun metagenomics allowed the rapid reconstruction and phylogenomic characterization of the first MPXV outbreak genome sequences, showing that this MPXV belongs to clade 3 and that the outbreak most likely has a single origin. Although 2022 MPXV (lineage B.1) clustered with 2018–2019 cases linked to an endemic country, it segregates in a divergent phylogenetic branch, likely reflecting continuous accelerated evolution. An in-depth mutational analysis suggests the action of host APOBEC3 in viral evolution as well as signs of potential MPXV human adaptation in ongoing microevolution. Our findings also indicate that genome sequencing may provide resolution to track the spread and transmission of this presumably slow-evolving double-stranded DNA virus."

https://openalex.org/W4283360267,"The impact of apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4), the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), on human brain cellular function remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of APOE4 on brain cell types derived from population and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells, post-mortem brain, and APOE targeted replacement mice. Population and isogenic models demonstrate that APOE4 local haplotype, rather than a single risk allele, contributes to risk. Global transcriptomic analyses reveal human-specific, APOE4-driven lipid metabolic dysregulation in astrocytes and microglia. APOE4 enhances de novo cholesterol synthesis despite elevated intracellular cholesterol due to lysosomal cholesterol sequestration in astrocytes. Further, matrisome dysregulation is associated with upregulated chemotaxis, glial activation, and lipid biosynthesis in astrocytes co-cultured with neurons, which recapitulates altered astrocyte matrisome signaling in human brain. Thus, APOE4 initiates glia-specific cell and non-cell autonomous dysregulation that may contribute to increased AD risk."

This pH optimum is maintained by proton influx produced by the V-ATPase and efflux through an unidentified ""H+ leak"" pathway. Here we show that TMEM175, a genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), mediates the lysosomal H+ leak by acting as a proton-activated, proton-selective channel on the lysosomal membrane (LyPAP). Acidification beyond the normal range potently activated LyPAP to terminate further acidification of lysosomes. An endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid and synthetic agonists also activated TMEM175 to trigger lysosomal proton release. TMEM175 deficiency caused lysosomal over-acidification, impaired proteolytic activity, and facilitated α-synuclein aggregation in vivo. Mutational and pH normalization analyses indicated that the channel's H+ conductance is essential for normal lysosome function. Thus, modulation of LyPAP by cellular cues may dynamically tune the pH optima of endosomes and lysosomes to regulate lysosomal degradation and PD pathology."

However, people are concerned about the safety and efficacy of this vaccination program. Thus, it has become crucial to examine the knowledge, attitude, and hesitancy towards the vaccine. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among university students of Bangladesh. Total of 449 university students participated. Most of these students used the internet (34.74%), social media (33.41%), and electronic media (25.61%) as a source of COVID-19 vaccine information. Overall, 58.13% and 64.81% of university students reported positive knowledge and attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine. 54.34% of these students agreed that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. 43.88% believed that the vaccine could stop the pandemic. The Spearman's Rank correlation determined the positive correlation between knowledge and attitude. The negative correlation was determined between positive knowledge and hesitancy, and positive attitude and hesitancy. University students with positive knowledge and attitude showed lower hesitancy. Multiple logistic regression analyses determined the university type and degree major as the predictors of knowledge, whereas only degree major was the predictor of attitudes. 26.06% of the study population showed their hesitancy towards the vaccine. University type and degree major were also determined as predictors of this hesitancy. They rated fear of side effects (87.18%) and lack of information (70.94%) as the most reasons for the hesitancy. The findings from this study can aid the ongoing and future COVID-19 vaccination plan for university students. The national and international authorities can have substantial information for a successful inoculation campaign."
https://openalex.org/W4283261633,"Tau aggregation into ordered assemblies causes neurodegenerative tauopathies. We previously reported that tau monomer exists in either inert (Mi) or seed-competent (Ms) conformational ensembles and that Ms encodes strains, that is, unique, self-replicating, biologically active assemblies. It is unknown if disease begins with Ms formation followed by fibril assembly or if Ms derives from fibrils and is therefore an epiphenomenon. Here, we studied a tauopathy mouse model (PS19) that expresses full-length mutant human (1N4R) tau (P301S). Insoluble tau seeding activity appeared at 2 months of age and insoluble tau protein assemblies by immunoblot at 3 months. Tau monomer from mice aged 1 to 6 weeks, purified using size-exclusion chromatography, contained soluble seeding activity at 4 weeks, before insoluble material or larger assemblies were observed, with assemblies ranging from n = 1 to 3 tau units. By 5 to 6 weeks, large soluble assemblies had formed. This indicated that the first detectable pathological forms of tau were in fact Ms. We next examined posttranslational modifications of tau monomer from 1 to 6 weeks. We detected no phosphorylation unique to Ms in PS19 or human Alzheimer's disease brains. We conclude that tauopathy begins with formation of the Ms monomer, whose activity is phosphorylation independent. Ms then self assembles to form oligomers before it forms insoluble fibrils. The conversion of tau monomer from Mi to Ms thus constitutes the first detectable step in the initiation of tauopathy in this mouse model, with obvious implications for the origins of tauopathy in humans."

Therapy for MDD requires prolonged treatment and often fails, predicating a need for novel treatment strategies. Here, we report increased ceramide levels in the blood plasma of MDD patients and in murine stress-induced models of MDD. These blood plasma ceramide levels correlated with the severity of MDD in human patients and were independent of age, sex, or body mass index. In addition, intravenous injection of anti-ceramide antibodies or neutral ceramidase rapidly abrogated stress-induced MDD, and intravenous injection of blood plasma from mice with MDD induced depression-like behavior in untreated mice, which was abrogated by ex vivo preincubation of the plasma with anti-ceramide antibodies or ceramidase. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ceramide accumulated in endothelial cells of the hippocampus of stressed mice, evidenced by the quantitative measurement of ceramide in purified hippocampus endothelial cells. We found ceramide inhibited the activity of phospholipase D (PLD) in endothelial cells in vitro and in the hippocampus in vivo and thereby decreased phosphatidic acid in the hippocampus. Finally, we show intravenous injection of PLD or phosphatidic acid abrogated MDD, indicating the significance of this pathway in MDD pathogenesis. Our data indicate that ceramide controls PLD activity and phosphatidic acid formation in hippocampal endothelial cells and thereby mediates MDD. We propose that neutralization of plasma ceramide could represent a rapid-acting targeted treatment for MDD."

This NADPH-dependent thiol oxidoreductase evolved through gene duplication within the Txnrd family, is expressed in the testes, and can reduce both thioredoxin and glutathione in vitro; however, the function of this enzyme remains unknown. To characterize the function of TXNRD3 in vivo, we generated a strain of mice bearing deletion of Txnrd3 gene. We show that these Txnrd3 knockout mice are viable and without discernable gross phenotypes, and also that TXNRD3 deficiency leads to fertility impairment in male mice. We found that Txnrd3 knockout animals exhibited a lower fertilization rate in vitro, a sperm movement phenotype, and an altered thiol redox status in sperm cells. Proteomic analyses further revealed a broad range of substrates reduced by TXNRD3 during sperm maturation, presumably as a part of sperm quality control. Taken together, these results show that TXNRD3 plays a critical role in male reproduction via the thiol redox control of spermatogenesis.

Taken together, these results show that TXNRD3 plays a critical role in male reproduction via the thiol redox control of spermatogenesis. Thioredoxin reductases (TXNRDs) are members of the pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase family, which utilize NADPH for the reduction of their thioredoxin substrates. Three TXNRD paralogs are present in mammals: TXNRD1, TXRND2, and TXRND3 (1Sun Q.-A. Su D. Novoselov S.V. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Reaction mechanism and regulation of mammalian thioredoxin/glutathione reductase.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14528-14537Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These proteins have a C-terminal penultimate selenocysteine (Sec) residue inserted cotranslationally in response to UGA codon. TXNRD1 and TXRND2 are thioredoxin reductases in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, and are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and cells (2Arner E.S.J. Focus on mammalian thioredoxin reductases — important selenoproteins with versatile functions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 495-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that TXNRD1 and TXNRD2, like their substrates (cytosolic Trx1 and mitochondrial Trx2), are essential enzymes, i.e., their knockout leads to early embryonic lethality in mice (3Jakupoglu C. Przemeck G.K.H. Schneider M. Moreno S.G. Mayr N. Hatzopoulos A.K. et al.Cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase is essential for embryogenesis but dispensable for cardiac development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A.

Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These and other studies revealed a critical role of TXNRDs and more generally of thiol-based redox control in mammals.The third mammalian thioredoxin reductase, TXNRD3, is unusual in that it has an additional N-terminal glutaredoxin (Grx) domain, which is fused to the canonical TXNRD module. Owing to this unusual domain organization, this enzyme can reduce both thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione disulfide and therefore was termed thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (5Turanov A.A. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Characterization of protein targets of mammalian thioredoxin reductases.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 474: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Glutathione (GSH) and Trx pathways are two major pathways that maintain the reduced state of cellular thiols and regulate redox homeostasis (6Bonilla M. Denicola A. Novoselov S.V. Turanov A.A. Protasio A. Izmendi D. et al.Platyhelminth mitochondrial and cytosolic redox homeostasis is controlled by a single thioredoxin glutathione reductase and dependent on selenium and glutathione.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17898-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the fact that one enzyme can support the function of both pathways is of great interest. Like other TXRNDs, TXNRD3 is a homodimer, with the monomers oriented in a head-to-tail manner. In mammals, TXNRD3 expression is largely restricted to the testis, and our previous studies suggested that TXNRD3 may be involved in the process of sperm maturation (7Su D. Novoselov S.V. Sun Q.-A. Moustafa M.E. Zhou Y. Oko R. et al.Mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26491-26498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It was proposed that TXNRD3 supports disulfide bond formation and isomerization. Of interest, in platyhelminth parasites, TXNRD3 is the only TXNRD encoded in the genome, and it was found that this enzyme maintains the reduced state of GSH and Trx in both cytosol and mitochondria (6Bonilla M. Denicola A. Novoselov S.V. Turanov A.A. Protasio A. Izmendi D. et al.Platyhelminth mitochondrial and cytosolic redox homeostasis is controlled by a single thioredoxin glutathione reductase and dependent on selenium and glutathione.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17898-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In the current work, to dissect the role of TXNRD3 in redox homeostasis and male reproduction in vivo, we prepared mice deficient in Txnrd3. In contrast to Txnrd1 and Txnrd2 knockout mice, Txnrd3 knockout mice are viable, but the deletion of this gene leads to male fertility impairment. We show that TXNRD3 functions to support the reduction of its substrates during epididymal sperm maturation. Accordingly, TXNRD3 deficiency disrupts redox homeostasis during this process, leading to abnormal motility of the sperm and ultimately to suboptimal male fertility.ResultsEvolution of the TXNRD family to a conserved testis-specific TXNRD3In mammals, TXNRDs are selenoproteins containing a C-terminal penultimate selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid encoded by UGA. Compared with the 55-kDa subunit homodimeric TXNRD1 or TXNRD2, TXNRD3 is composed of two 65-kDa subunits because it has an additional N-terminal Grx domain (Fig. 1A). The reductase function of TXNRDs is supported by a conserved CxxxC motif, which accepts electrons from FAD thereby mediating the flow of reducing equivalents from NADPH to Trx (Fig. 1B). Our analysis (7Su D. Novoselov S.V. Sun Q.-A. Moustafa M.E. Zhou Y. Oko R. et al.Mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26491-26498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) suggested that mammalian TXNRD1 and TXNRD3 evolved by gene duplication from an ancestral protein similar to fish Grx-containing TXNRD1 (Fig. 1C). TXNRD1 then lost the Grx domain (except for some rare isoforms), whereas the second Cys in the catalytic CxxC motif of the Grx domain of TNXRD3 was mutated to serine. We examined the average expression of TNXRD3 mRNA (transcripts per million) across different tissues of various species of tetrapods. Unlike TXNRD1 (present in the cytoplasm in various tissues) and TXNRD2 (present in mitochondria in various tissues), in most analyzed species TXNRD3 is highly expressed only in the testis (Fig. 1D). This observation is strongly suggestive of a role of TXNRD3 in male reproduction, as well as that this biological function is conserved across tetrapods.TXNRD3-deficient mice are viable but exhibit impaired fertilityTo get insights into the function of TXNRD3 in vivo, we generated Txnrd3 KO mice. The murine Txnrd3 gene comprises seven exons, and the Txnrd3-deficient mice were generated using a targeting strategy that replaced the third exon of Txnrd3 (Fig. S1A). ES cell clones were tested for homologous recombination by PCR and verified by Southern blotting (Fig. S1B). Upon injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts, a recombinant ES clone contributed to chimeric males, which transmitted the targeted allele to the germ line. The resulting Txnrd3-deficient mice were genotyped using mutant and allele-specific primers (Fig. S1C).This procedure yielded viable homozygous Txnrd3 KO mice, indicating that TXNRD3, in contrast to two other mammalian TXNRDs, is not essential during embryonic development and subsequent life. We also observed no other gross phenotypes in Txnrd3 KO mice, in both males and females. Since the Txnrd3 knockout allele was present in germ cells, its F1 × F1 cross should result in offspring having all three possible genotypes (Txnrd3+/+; Txnrd3+/−; Txnrd3−/−) with the Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1. However, the actual ratio was 1:1.7:0.56 (WT: heterozygous: homozygous) (Table S1). This reduction in the number of homozygous mutants suggested a possibility of fertility impairment involving Txnrd3-deficient germline. To quantify this phenotype, we set up three mating groups of mice, including WT × WT, heterozygous KO × heterozygous KO, and homozygous KO × homozygous KO, with seven pairs of animals in each group. By keeping males with females for 2 weeks and later recording the timing of females giving birth, we found that it took longer for Txnrd3-null females to give birth to offspring (WT 24.43 ± 4.54 days versus Txnrd3−/− 36.57 ± 16.27 days, p = 0.081, n = 7; WT 24.43 ± 4.54 days versus Txnrd3+/− 35.00 ± 17.18 days, p = 0.141, n = 7; Txnrd3+/− 35.00 ± 17.18 days versus Txnrd3−/− 36.57 ± 16.27 days, p = 0.863, n = 7). It is also of note that two Txnrd3−/− females did not give birth (they were monitored for 60 days) (Fig. 2A), supporting a potential role of TXNRD3 for the germline. In addition, there were fewer pups per litter in the case of homozygous KO mice (WT 7.43 ± 1.72 versus Txnrd3−/− 3.71 ± 2.69, p = 0.010, n = 7; WT 7.43 ± 1.72 versus Txnrd3+/− 4.29 ± 2.98, p = 0.033, n = 7; Txnrd3+/− 4.29 ± 2.98 versus Txnrd3−/− 3.71 ± 2.69, p = 0.713, n = 7) (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Deletion of mouse Txnrd3 gene impairs male fertility.

To further explore fertility of Txnrd3-null mice, we carried out in vitro fertilization. The in vitro fertilization rate with cumulus oocyte complex-intact eggs was significantly lower when the sperm from Txnrd3−/− males was compared with the WT sperm (WT 43.40 ± 8.15 versus Txrnd3−/− 29.03 ± 1.78, p = 0.041, n = 3) (Fig. 2, D and E). Finally, we examined movement of free-swimming spermatozoa isolated from WT, Txnrd3+/−, and Txnrd3−/− mice. Compared with WT mice, the fraction of motile spermatozoa was visibly lower in Txnrd3−/− mice (Movie S1).Taken together, our data suggest that, although TXNRD3 is neither essential for development nor for male fertility in general, its KO leads to reduced sperm motility and fertility, making these male subfertile. In the accompanying article (8Wang H. Dou Q. Jung K.J. Choi J. Gladyshev V.N. Chung J.-J.

Chem. 2021; 298: 102077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we provide further evidence for the role of TXNRD3 in epididymal maturation, and specifically its impact on capacitation-associated mitochondrial activation and sperm motility.Thiol peroxidases as interacting partners of TXNRD3Previous functional characterization and localization of TXNRD3 revealed its possible disulfide bond isomerization activity and a close functional relationship to another selenoprotein, GPX4 (7Su D. Novoselov S.V. Sun Q.-A. Moustafa M.E. Zhou Y. Oko R. et al.Mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26491-26498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The use of String to examine the association between TXNRD3 and GPX4 showed a combined score of 0.717, suggesting a high confidence functional link between these two proteins (Fig. S2A). To further characterize this association, we analyzed protein levels of TXNRD3 and GPX4 in the mouse testis and sperm by immunoblotting. Interesting, GPX4 expression was higher in Txnrd3−/− testes than in WT testes (WT 0.77 ± 0.11 versus Txnrd3−/− 0.96 ± 0.04, p = 0.049, n = 3; WT 0.77 ± 0.11 versus Txnrd3+/− 0.82 ± 0.02, p = 0.424, n = 3; Txnrd3+/− 0.82 ± 0.02 versus Txnrd3−/− 0.96 ± 0.04, p = 0.006, n = 3) (Fig. 3A), whereas the expression of this protein in the sperm was not much affected (Fig. 3B). Immunohistochemical staining of TXNRD3 and GPX4 showed a similar pattern (Fig. 3, C and D).Figure 3Expression of TXNRD3 and GPX4 in mouse testis and sperm.

In particular, peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4) is thought to play a role in this process by regulating oxidative packaging of sperm chromatin (10Fujii J. Ikeda Y. Kurahashi T. Homma T. Physiological and pathological views of peroxiredoxin 4.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 83: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on String, the association among PRDX4, GPX4, and TXNRD3 showed a medium confidence (Fig. S2A). We detected the expression of PRDX4 in mouse testis and sperm, and its expression in the testis was particularly high. We also found that PRDX4 expression was decreased in Txnrd3-deficient testis compared with WT (Fig. 2, B and C). Altogether, these analyses were suggestive of a possible functional association of TXNRD3 with thiol peroxidases of the GPX and PRDX families, but further studies are needed to clarify this possibility.A role of TXNRD3 in maintaining thiol redox status of sperm proteinsRedox homeostasis has been identified as a critical factor in male infertility (11Agarwal A. Virk G. Ong C. du Plessis S.S. Effect of oxidative stress on male reproduction.World J. Mens Health. 2014; 32: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as spermatogenesis is associated with dramatic redox transitions leading to widespread oxidation of thiols. Consistent with this notion, sperm is particularly susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) during critical phases of sperm development (12Sabeti P. Pourmasumi S. Rahiminia T. Akyash F. Talebi A.R. Etiologies of sperm oxidative stress.Int. J. Reprod. Biomed. 2016; 14: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 3C) and Fig. S2 in our companion article (8Wang H. Dou Q. Jung K.J. Choi J. Gladyshev V.N. Chung J.-J. Redox regulation by TXNRD3 during epididymal maturation underlies capacitation-associated mitochondrial activation and sperm motility in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 298: 102077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar), TXNRD3 is highly expressed in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and early spermatids, so its deficiency may be particularly detrimental for the thiol redox transition. By using CM-H2DCFDA to detect ROS, we found no significant differences between KO and WT sperm (Fig. 4A). This is not unexpected—while intracellular thiols are among the major targets of ROS (13Baba S.P. Bhatnagar A. Role of thiols in oxidative stress.Curr. Opin. Toxicol. 2018; 7: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), thiol redox dysfunction does not necessarily have to involve ROS. To assess potential protein thiol changes in the Txnrd3 KO sperm, we employed BODIPY-NEM as a fluorescent probe to directly label thiols in sperm samples (14Hill B.G. Reily C. Oh J.-Y. Johnson M.S. Landar A. Methods for the determination and quantification of the reactive thiol proteome.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), followed by flow cytometry. We observed a lower percentage of BODIPY-NEM-positive sperm in Txnrd3−/− than in WT mice (WT 86.57 ± 6.12 versus Txnrd3−/− 64.17 ± 9.12, p = 0.024, n = 3) (Fig. 4B), consistent with the idea that TXNRD3 supports the formation or maintenance of thiols during sperm maturation.Figure 4Analyses of redox characteristics of sperm.

We examined the levels of glutathionylated proteins and found no differences between WT, Txnrd3+/−, and Txnrd3−/− mice (Fig. 5A). In addition, we performed immunoprecipitation to enrich glutathionylated proteins in mouse testis and sperm and again found no differences among animal groups (Fig. 5, B and C). We also tested thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), glutathione S-transferase A2 (GSTa2), and glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTm1) expression in the testis and sperm (Fig. 4C). The expression of Trx1 in Txnrd3−/− sperm was elevated. This is a conserved thiol oxidoreductase that maintains protein thiols in the reduced state; it is also a substrate for TXRNDs, including TXNRD3 (16Wu C. Parrott A.M. Fu C. Liu T. Marino S.M.

These disulfides are crucial for DNA packaging, as its mispackaging in the sperm head results in decreased fertility, higher rates of miscarriage, and higher rates of genetic disease in the offspring (18Hutchison J.M.

To test the possibility that TXNRD3 deficiency affects disulfide bond formation, we employed diagonal gel electrophoresis, thereby examining oligomeric proteins containing interchain disulfide bonds. Overall protein patterns of both WT and Txnrd3−/− testes and sperm showed similar patterns of protein cross-linking (Fig. S3). Our findings suggest dysfunction in thiol redox homeostasis might occur during spermatogenesis and sperm maturation in Txnrd3−/− males.Putative TXNRD3 targetsAs TXNRD3 exhibits NADPH-dependent thiol reductase activities in vitro, and its deficiency reduces the levels of thiols in sperm, a reasonable possibility is that this enzyme supports the reduction of disulfide-containing substrates during sperm maturation. Aiming to detect such putative endogenous TXNRD3 targets, we adapted a procedure for their enrichment and applied it to three different areas of the epididymis (caput, corpus, and cauda), profiling the epididymal luminal content of Txnrd3 KO and WT sperm (eight mice per group). This approach was based on the assumption that misoxidized target proteins are normally reduced by TXNRD3 in WT mice and therefore may proceed to their correct oxidized state during sperm maturation, whereas these proteins partially remain in the incorrect oxidized form in Txnrd3 KO mice (Fig. S4). As a first step, free thiols in sperm lysates of Txnrd3 KO and WT mice were blocked with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), and the lysates were applied to a column containing the Grx domain of TXNRD3, which was in the pre-reduced state (corresponding to the NADPH-reduced state of TXNRD3). The targets reduced by this domain were then applied to a thiol-trapping column and eluted with DTT. The resulting eluates, putatively enriched for TXNRD3 targets, were treated with iodoacetamide to block any free thiols and subjected to proteomics analyses. Spectral counts of detected proteins (Fig. S5 and Table S2) were normalized using the Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor approach (19Paoletti A.C. Parmely T.J. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Zhu D. Conaway R.C. et al.Quantitative proteomic analysis of distinct mammalian mediator complexes using normalized spectral abundance factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Quantitative shotgun proteomics using a protease with broad specificity and normalized spectral abundance factors.Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we detected more proteins in KO than in WT samples, consistent with the broad range of substrates. To uncover relevant patterns of proteins present in Txnrd3 KO but not in WT samples, we devised four selection criteria (Fig. S6), and their application to the proteomic dataset led to a set of putative target proteins (Fig. 6). Interestingly, this approach did not reveal a single bona fide TXNRD3 target. Instead, we detected a broad range of target proteins. Based on functional enrichment analysis (DAVID functional annotation tool v6.8), the set of putative targets (103 proteins) was enriched for proteins annotated as RNA binding (p-value = 1.77E-5; false discovery rate = 0.024). In addition, a set of mitochondrial proteins (ten proteins) involved in metabolism were detected only in the cauda sperm from Txnrd3 KO mice, suggesting that TXNRD3 deficiency might affect ATP production by sperm cells. This finding is consistent with the idea that TXNRD3 reduces a broad set of proteins during spermatogenesis and sperm maturation.Figure 6Putative TXNRD3 target proteins.

As the third member of this family, TXNRD3, is abundantly expressed in the testes across tetrapods, we considered a possibility that this protein instead plays an essential role in spermatogenesis. We developed Txnrd3 KO mice and, as predicted, found that they were viable and without gross phenotypes. Unexpectedly, however, Txnrd3 KO males were fertile, i.e., TXNRD3 was not essential for male reproduction. However, by applying a mating scheme to more carefully examine fertility of WT and KO animals, we found that fertility of Txnrd3−/− males was in fact partially compromised. In addition, an in vitro fertilization experiment showed a lower fertilization rate of Txnrd3−/− mice compared with WT mice, and the Txnrd3−/− sperm exhibited an altered state of thiols. These data revealed that, although TXNRD3 is not essential for male reproduction, it plays an important role in this process by supporting redox homeostasis during spermatogenesis. As TXNRD3 is conserved in mammals, presumably its function is also conserved, and the subfertility associated with its deficiency must be severe enough in the wild to preserve the protein in these organisms over great evolutionary distances.Owing to is domain organization, TXNRD3 may be viewed as a component of both Trx and GSH systems. The Trx system provides reducing equivalents to many proteins, and especially to thiol peroxidases, such as PRDXs. It was found that Trx1 can be directly reduced by TXNRD3 and TXNRD3 could support the reduction of thiol peroxidases via thioredoxin (21Lu J. Holmgren A. The thioredoxin antioxidant system.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2014; 66: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 22Dorey A. Cwiklinski K. Rooney J. De Marco Verissimo C. López Corrales J.

Microbiol. 2021; 11: 667272Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, Trx1 expression was higher in Txnrd3−/− mice sperm (compared with WT mice), suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism. It would be interesting to examine whether the elevated Trx1 is also altered with regard to its redox state. An additional compensatory mechanism could be provided by the elevated expression of GSTs, in combination with an altered level of redox state of glutathione. An attractive possibility is that such mechanisms partially rescue TXNRD3 function, precluding male infertility.One of PRDXs, PRDX4, was also implicated in male reproduction through redox homeostasis (23Tasaki E.

Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) has been reported to regulate gene expression by catalyzing adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing reactions; however, potential roles of ADAR1 in the regulation of MRP4 expression have not been investigated. In this study, we found that downregulation of ADAR1 increased the expression of MRP4 in human renal cells at the posttranscriptional level. Luciferase reporter assays and microarray analysis revealed that downregulation of ADAR1 reduced the levels of microRNA miR-381-3p, which led to the corresponding upregulation of MPR4 expression. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of closed-loop endogenous noncoding RNAs that play an essential role in gene expression by acting as miRNA sponges. We demonstrate that ADAR1 repressed the biogenesis of circRNA circHIPK3 through its adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing activity, which altered the secondary structure of the precursor of circHIPK3. Furthermore, in silico analysis suggested that circHIPK3 acts as a sponge of miR-381-3p. Indeed, we found overexpression of circHIPK3 induced the expression of MRP4 through its interference with miR-381-3p. Taken together, our study provides novel insights into regulation of the expression of xenobiotic transporters through circRNA expression by the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1."
https://openalex.org/W4283589227,"The prevalence of allergic diseases is on the rise, yet the environmental factors that contribute to this increase are still being elucidated. Laundry detergent (LD) that contains cytotoxic ingredients including microbial enzymes continuously comes into contact with the skin starting in infancy. An impaired skin barrier has been suggested as a route of allergic sensitization. We hypothesized that exposure of skin to LD damages the skin barrier resulting in systemic sensitization to allergens that enter through the impaired skin barrier. Mouse skin samples exposed in vitro to microbial proteases or LD exhibited physical damage, which was more pronounced in neonatal skin as compared to adult skin. Exposure of the skin to microbial proteases in vitro resulted in an increase in the levels of interleukin (IL)-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). BALB/c wild type mice epicutaneously exposed to LD and ovalbumin (OVA) showed an increase in levels of transepidermal water loss, serum OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgE antibodies, and a local increase of Il33, Tslp, Il4 and Il13 compared with LD or OVA alone. Following intranasal challenge with OVA, mice epicutaneously exposed to LD showed an increase in allergen-induced esophageal eosinophilia compared with LD or OVA alone. Collectively, these results suggest that LD may be an important factor that impairs the skin barrier and leads to allergen sensitization in early life, and therefore may have a role in the increase in allergic disease."

Understanding how these cell surface receptors signal intracellularly is crucial to understanding the hemostatic and thrombotic process.There are two main categories of receptors on the platelet surface: the G protein–coupled receptors and those that signal through a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. Those that signal through a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase include the ITAM-bearing GPVI receptor and the Fc receptor for immunoglobulin, FcγRIIA, as well as the hemITAM-bearing receptor CLEC-2.

Syk is then phosphorylated by SFKs and subsequently by autophosphorylation. Although the identities of tyrosine sites that are phosphorylated are established, their roles in Syk activation are not yet clear. Activation of Syk in this manner allows phosphorylation of linker for activation of T-cell (LAT) and subsequent activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Subsequently, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is activated and recruited to the signaling complex and in cooperation with LAT phosphorylates phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2) (25Watanabe N. Nakajima H. Suzuki H.

However, in either case, Syk is required.Syk is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues in response to GPVI or CLEC-2 engagement.

Furthermore, we and others have demonstrated that both Syk Y519/520 and Y346 are phosphorylated downstream of CLEC-2 (32Kostyak J.C. Liverani E. Kunapuli S.P.

The molecular basis of this involvement remains not fully understood, since Syk YY519/520FF reduces Syk in vitro kinase activity modestly, while substantially diminishing tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and cellular proteins, although the degree of this effect differs for various proteins (37Zhang J.

The molecular basis of their functions is not fully understood, but it appears likely that phosphorylation of these residues is involved in the transition of Syk from its autoinhibited to its active conformation (44Gradler U.

Biol. 2011; 31: 2984-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the results vary in different cell types and for different responses, and very little data have been obtained in platelets, so we were compelled to address this problem. To begin addressing it, we produced Syk Y342F knock-in mice where the tyrosine at position 342 was mutated to phenylalanine. In this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Y342 on Syk plays an important positive regulatory role in the signal transduction from an ITAM or a hemITAM receptor. We will also show that bleeding is unaffected in Syk Y342F mice while thrombus formation is significantly prolonged.ResultsProduction and characterization of Syk Y342F knock-in micePrimary mast cells and basophilic cells in culture expressing Syk Y342F as a result of transfection or transduction demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of mutated Syk and proteins important for ITAM-mediated signaling was reduced as compared with cells expressing WT Syk (40Zhang J. Berenstein E. Siraganian R.P. Phosphorylation of Tyr342 in the linker region of Syk is critical for Fc epsilon RI signaling in mast cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8144-8154Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 41Simon M. Vanes L. Geahlen R.L. Tybulewicz V.L.

Therefore, to determine the function of Y342 in downstream signaling of hemITAM receptors and ITAM receptors, and phosphorylation of other sites on Syk, we produced an Syk Y342F knock-in mouse using the CRSPR/Cas9 technique through a commercial source (Cyagen). The Syk Y342F mutation was confirmed by both sequencing and digesting the PCR product with a restriction enzyme, RsaI. The oligonucleotides used for PCR are forward primer 5′-CTCCGCTGCATGCAACTGTC and reverse primer 5′-GCAGTGCAATGAGTCAACGGTGC. RsaI can cleave the WT nucleotide sequence (gtac) but cannot cleave the knock-in sequence (gttc). Therefore, the results after the digest are as follows: WT (+/+) 166 & 155 bp products, heterozygous (+/−) 155, 166, and 317 bp products, and homozygous (−/−) 317 bp product. An example of these PCR products is shown in Figure 1A. We also confirmed that the genotyping using sequencing of the PCR product (Fig. 1B). To confirm the Y342F mutation at the protein level, we isolated platelets from Syk Y342F and WT littermate control mice and stimulated them with collagen-related peptide (CRP). We performed Western blot analysis to visualize phosphorylation of Y342. We observed a robust band in WT mouse platelets treated with CRP at any concentration, but no band is present at the expected molecular weight in samples obtained from Syk Y342F mouse platelets (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that we successfully produced Syk Y342F knock-in mice.Syk Y342F knock-in mice are viableHeterozygous Syk Y342F knock-in mice and homozygous Syk Y342F knock-in mice bred normally and produced pups at expected Mendelian ratios. In contrast, Syk knockout mice are not viable and die perinatally (45Cheng A.M. Rowley B. Pao W. Hayday A. Bolen J.B. Pawson T.

Blood cell counts were not altered in Syk Y342F knock-in mice except for significantly reduced circulating red blood cells (Table 1). As all other cell counts were normal, we chose not to pursue the red blood cell number reduction during this study. However, it is an interesting finding and would be worth investigating later. Platelets from Syk Y342F mice respond normally to the G protein–coupled receptor agonists AYPGKF (PAR4) and 2-MeSADP (P2Y) (Fig. 2).Table 1Blood cell counts from Syk Y342F and WT littermate control miceGenotypeWBC (K/ml)NE (K/ml)LY (K/ml)RBC (M/ml)PLT (K/ml)MPV (fl)SykWT/WT8.86 ± 0.800.92 ± 0.127.44 ± 0.719.76 ± 0.23692.48 ± 20.794.07 ± 0.05SykY342F/Y342F10.54 ± 1.090.63 ± 0.139.22 ± 0.858.40 ± 0.13ap < 0.05 compared with WT, n = 12.710.44 ± 66.023.98 ± 0.05Abbreviations: LY, lymphocyte; MPV, mean platelet volume; NE, neutrophil; PLT, platelet; RBC, red blood cell; WBC, white blood cell.a p < 0.05 compared with WT, n = 12.

SCR has been observed in viruses, fungi, and multicellular organisms, including mammals. However, SCR is largely unexplored in plants. In this study, we have analyzed ribosome profiling datasets to identify mRNAs that exhibit SCR in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analyses of the ribosome density, ribosome coverage, and three-nucleotide periodicity of the ribosome profiling reads in the mRNA region downstream of the stop codon provided strong evidence for SCR in mRNAs of 144 genes. We show that SCR generated putative evolutionarily conserved nuclear localization signals, transmembrane helices, and intrinsically disordered regions in the C-terminal extensions of several of these proteins. Furthermore, gene ontology functional enrichment analysis revealed that these 144 genes belong to three major functional groups—translation, photosynthesis, and abiotic stress tolerance. Using a luminescence-based readthrough assay, we experimentally demonstrated SCR in representative mRNAs belonging to each of these functional classes. Finally, using microscopy, we show that the SCR product of one gene that contains a nuclear localization signal at the C-terminal extension, CURT1B, localizes to the nucleus as predicted. Based on these observations, we propose that SCR plays an important role in plant physiology by regulating protein localization and function.

A stop codon on an mRNA signals the translating ribosomes to terminate the process of translation. However, in certain mRNAs, ribosomes fail to terminate at the canonical stop codon and continue translation till the next in-frame stop codon. This is caused by recoding of stop codons by a near-cognate tRNA or a suppressor tRNA. This process of stop codon readthrough (SCR) generates protein isoforms with extended C terminus, thus contributing to proteome expansion (1Schueren F. Thoms S. Functional translational readthrough: a systems biology perspective.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12e1006196Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Manjunath L.E. Singh A. Som S. Eswarappa S.M. Mammalian proteome expansion by stop codon readthrough.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2022; e1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Because of the extended C terminus, the protein isoform generated by SCR can be different from the canonical isoform in terms of its localization, function, or stability (3Eswarappa S.M. Potdar A.A.

Gartner J. et al.Peroxisomal lactate dehydrogenase is generated by translational readthrough in mammals.Elife. 2014; 3e03640Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since this process occurs at the translational level, SCR enables cells to swiftly respond to environmental cues.SCR has been observed in bacteria, yeast, insects, mammals, and viruses. About 5% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes are targets of SCR (7Kleppe A.S. Bornberg-Bauer E. Robustness by intrinsically disordered C-termini and translational readthrough.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 10184-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). mRNAs of 283 Drosophila genes exhibit signs of SCR (8Jungreis I. Lin M.F. Spokony R. Chan C.S. Negre N. Victorsen A. et al.Evidence of abundant stop codon readthrough in Drosophila and other metazoa.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 2096-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In cases of mammals, SCR has been demonstrated only in 14 mammalian mRNAs. SCR is usually regulated by cis-acting RNA element (e.g., pseudoknot and stem-loop structures) present downstream of the stop codons (9Firth A.E. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Stimulation of stop codon readthrough: frequent presence of an extended 3' RNA structural element.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6679-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). trans-acting factors (RNA-binding proteins or microRNAs) also regulate SCR in certain cases (2Manjunath L.E. Singh A. Som S. Eswarappa S.M. Mammalian proteome expansion by stop codon readthrough.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2022; e1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 3Eswarappa S.M. Potdar A.A.

Suma H.R. et al.Let-7a-regulated translational readthrough of mammalian AGO1 generates a microRNA pathway inhibitor.EMBO J. 2019; 38e100727Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These factors possibly cause ribosomal pausing at the stop codon, which provides sufficient opportunity for the near-cognate tRNAs to recognize the stop codon, resulting in SCR (2Manjunath L.E. Singh A. Som S. Eswarappa S.M. Mammalian proteome expansion by stop codon readthrough.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2022; e1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The context of the stop codon can make an mRNA permissive for SCR. For example, the sequence CUAG immediately after the stop codon is critical for the SCR in some mammalian mRNAs (e.g., OPRL1) (10Loughran G. Chou M.Y. Ivanov I.P. Jungreis I. Kellis M. Kiran A.M. et al.Evidence of efficient stop codon readthrough in four mammalian genes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 8928-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).The SCR products can have properties different from those of the canonical isoforms due to the C-terminal extension. For example, they can have different localization (e.g., LDHB and MDH1) (6Schueren F. Lingner T. George R. Hofhuis J. Dickel C.

For example, tobacco necrosis virus-D expresses its polymerase, and potato leafroll virus generates a minor capsid protein by SCR (19Xu Y. Ju H.J. DeBlasio S. Carino E.J. Johnson R.

It enables viruses to maximize the coding potential of their compact genome. Since plant viruses utilize the translation machinery of the host, it is likely that some plant mRNAs are subjected to SCR. However, so far, there is only one report of SCR in a plant mRNA. SCR in Arabidopsis eRF1-1 mRNA regulates its expression by protecting the mRNA from nonsense–mediated decay (21Nyiko T. Auber A. Szabadkai L. Benkovics A. Auth M. Merai Z. et al.Expression of the eRF1 translation termination factor is controlled by an autoregulatory circuit involving readthrough and nonsense-mediated decay in plants.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 4174-4188PubMed Google Scholar). A wide range of other translation regulation mechanisms have been observed during plant development, light-dark cycle, viral infections, and environmental stresses (22Urquidi Camacho R.A. Lokdarshi A. von Arnim A.G. Translational gene regulation in plants: a green new deal.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2020; 11e1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A genome-wide analysis of SCR, which is also a translation regulation mechanism, is lacking to understand its role in plant physiology.Ribosome profiling technique, based on the deep sequencing of ribosome protected RNA fragments, has revolutionized our understanding of the process of translation and its regulation. Because it reveals ribosome-occupied regions on an mRNA, ribosome profiling has the potential to identify novel translation events such as SCR (23Dunn J.G. Foo C.K. Belletier N.G. Gavis E.R. Weissman J.S. Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive and regulated stop codon readthrough in Drosophila melanogaster.Elife. 2013; 2e01179Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed ribosome profiling datasets and identified 144 genes of Arabidopsis thaliana as targets of SCR. Further, we experimentally confirmed this process in five candidate genes.ResultsSelection and curation of ribosome profiling datasetsThe presence of translating ribosomes after the canonical stop codon of an mRNA strongly indicates SCR (23Dunn J.G. Foo C.K. Belletier N.G. Gavis E.R. Weissman J.S. Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive and regulated stop codon readthrough in Drosophila melanogaster.Elife. 2013; 2e01179Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We analyzed ribosome profiling data generated from A. thaliana, which are available at Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of National Center for Biotechnology Information. We retrieved 14 A. thaliana ribosome profiling datasets from SRA and processed them as described in Experimental procedures.Ribosomal footprints obtained from translating ribosomes exhibit frame bias, i.e., they show a fixed distribution of reads across the three frames of the coding sequence (CDS). This three-nucleotide periodicity (or phasing) is a sign of translation on the corresponding region of an mRNA (in our case, the proximal 3′UTR [untranslated region]). This kind of spatial resolution along mRNAs is required in ribosome profiling datasets to claim unusual translation events such as SCR. Therefore, we first analyzed the three-nucleotide periodicity profile of the ribosome profiling datasets. We chose nine ribosome profiling datasets based on a clear three-nucleotide periodicity of ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) reads corresponding to the CDSs of all genes. A representative profile is shown in Figure 1A.These nine datasets were derived from seedlings, root, shoot, flower, and from a cell line of A. thaliana (Table S1) (24Merchante C. Brumos J. Yun J.

We then analyzed the length distribution of the reads in each dataset. Length distribution was consistent with footprints of 80S ribosomes, which is a signature of translation. A representative length distribution is shown in Figure 1B. Based on this distribution, we chose the reads of three most abundant lengths for further analyses.After removing the reads that map onto noncoding RNAs, we aligned the rest of the reads with A. thaliana protein-coding mRNAs. Only those reads that align 100% (i.e., without any mismatch) with an mRNA were considered for the analysis. As our aim was to identify SCR events, we focused on the ribosome footprints in the proximal part of the 3′UTR—from the canonical stop codon to the downstream in-frame stop codon (Fig. S1). This region was termed the interstop codon region (ISR). mRNAs without downstream in-frame stop codon were not included in the analysis.Two hundred fifteen mRNAs from 144 genes of A. thaliana show evidence of SCRWe subjected the mRNAs of A. thaliana to a stringent four-level screening to identify the targets of SCR (Figs. 1C and S2). It is important to distinguish ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) reads due to SCR from reads resulting from nontranslating events (32Guydosh N.R. Green R. Dom34 rescues ribosomes in 3' untranslated regions.Cell. 2014; 156: 950-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This was achieved by comparing the ribosome densities in different regions of an mRNA. The average ribosome density in the 3′UTR of mRNAs indicates ribosome occupancy due to events not related to translation. mRNAs that showed at least 4-fold higher ribosome density in the ISR compared to the rest of the 3′UTR were considered for further analysis. One thousand one hundred forty-four mRNAs were identified in this first level of screening (Fig. S2 and Table S1).It is possible that the increased ribosome density can be due to a specific segment of the ISR with a strong RNA structure or a strong interaction with a protein (or any trans-acting molecule). To exclude such events, we subjected the mRNAs to a coverage-based filtering. We eliminated mRNAs with <50% coverage in the ISR and >25% coverage in the rest of the 3′UTR. Five hundred fifty mRNAs satisfied this criterion, and all of them had at least one ribo-seq read spanning the canonical stop codon (Fig. S2 and Table S1).The three-nucleotide periodicity profile of the ribo-seq reads assigned to ISR, similar to that of the reads assigned to the CDS, provides strong evidence for SCR. Two hundred thirty-six mRNAs satisfied this third level of screening. It is possible that the remaining mRNAs may include ribosomal frameshifting (also known as translational frameshifting) candidates. We did not pursue frameshifting events as the focus of our study was SCR, where the frame of the ribosomes translating the ISR is same as that in the CDS. The ribosome density profile and the three-nucleotide periodicity profile of the ISRs of five representative genes—RPS15AD, CURT1B, CAM1, DXR, and MUB6—are shown in Figures 2 and 3 and Fig. S3.Figure 2Ribosomal density in the ISR of five SCR-positive mRNAs—RPS15AD, CURT1B, CAM1, MUB6, and DXR.

The annotation of the CDS on mRNAs can vary across the databases, providing false-positive evidence for SCR. To rule this out, we performed BLAST analysis for the peptides encoded by the ISRs of 236 mRNAs that passed the screening described above, against National Center for Biotechnology Information’s protein database for A. thaliana. We found 21 matches, which were eliminated in this fourth level screening.Thus, 215 mRNAs encoded by 144 genes of A. thaliana passed our stringent four-level screening, and they were designated as SCR-positive genes (Fig. S2 and Table S2). The average ribosome density in the ISR increased with each screening step (Fig. 4A). Also, the average ribosome density in the ISR of SCR-positive mRNAs was 10-fold higher compared to the same in all mRNAs. This difference was not observed in the ribosome density of the 3′UTR excluding the ISR (Fig. 4B).Figure 4Ribosomal density in the ISR of SCR-positive mRNAs.

ISR, interstop codon region; SCR, stop codon readthrough; UTR, untranslated region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results show that our screening methods were able to identify translational events immediately after the stop codon, which constitutes SCR. Though translational frameshifting could also result in increased ribosomal density in the 3′UTR, the three-nucleotide periodicity-based third screen will remove frameshifting events as described above. We have not allowed a single mismatch while assigning reads to different regions of an mRNA. Also, all SCR-positive candidates have at least one ribosome profiling read mapping on to the region spanning the canonical stop codon (the junction of the CDS and the ISR). These two conditions rule out RNA editing and polymorphism at the stop codon as reasons for ribosome footprints after the stop codon.In our analyses, we have excluded genes which have ISRs and/or 3′UTRs <45 nucleotides and genes with <30 reads in their ISR. Also, our method does not reveal SCR events that occur under specific physiological or pathological conditions not included in the ribosome profiling studies. Hence, 144 SCR-positive genes is an underestimate; it is likely that more mRNAs exhibit SCR in A. thaliana. For example, we did not observe any ribo-seq footprints in the ISR of eRF1-1, whose SCR has been demonstrated in A. thaliana (21Nyiko T. Auber A. Szabadkai L. Benkovics A. Auth M. Merai Z. et al.Expression of the eRF1 translation termination factor is controlled by an autoregulatory circuit involving readthrough and nonsense-mediated decay in plants.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 4174-4188PubMed Google Scholar).The stop codon TGA is enriched in SCR-positive genesSince the identity of the stop codons can influence the efficiency of translation termination (33Palma M. Lejeune F. Deciphering the molecular mechanism of stop codon readthrough.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2021; 96: 310-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we examined the distribution of the three stop codons among the SCR-positive mRNAs at their canonical termination position. We observed a 25% higher occurrence of TGA stop codon in SCR-positive mRNAs compared to the expected frequency (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, TGA is the leakiest among the three stop codons, which facilitates the process of SCR.Figure 5The canonical stop codon and its context in SCR-positive mRNAs. A, distribution of the three stop codons in SCR-positive mRNAs. Expected values were obtained based on their occurrence in all mRNAs of A. thaliana.

Statistical analysis of readthrough levels for nonsense mutations in mammalian cells reveals a major determinant of response to gentamicin.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8e1002608Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined if there are any conserved sequences around the stop codon in SCR-positive mRNAs. We used WebLogo, a sequence logo generator, to visualize the extent of conservation around the stop codon (35Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. WebLogo: a sequence logo generator.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8010) Google Scholar). Here, the height of the stack indicates the extent of conservation at that particular position. Interestingly, nucleotides just before (−1) and after (+1) and the stop codon showed higher conservation compared to other positions. A and U were more frequently observed in these positions than the other two nucleotides (Fig. 5B). These conserved residues are possibly important to provide SCR-permissive context in SCR-positive mRNAs.Gene ontology analysis: Genes involved in translation, photosynthesis, and stress response are enriched in SCR-positive genesEvolutionary conservation at the amino acid level is an indication of functional significance of that region in protein-coding genes. We analyzed the evolutionary conservation of amino acid sequences potentially encoded by the ISRs of all SCR-positive genes, across seven plant species belonging to Brassicaceae family (A. thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Brassica rapa, Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, Eutrema salsugineum, Raphanus sativus). The average amino acid conservation at the ISR was significantly higher compared to that in rest of the 3′UTR, indicating functional significance of SCR (Fig. 6). Absence of conservation in some SCR-positive genes could imply that those SCR events have appeared later during evolution and therefore are specific to A thaliana.Figure 6Evolutionary conservation of the ISRs of SCR-positive genes. Amino acid sequences encoded by the CDS, ISR, and 3′UTR (excluding the ISR) of SCR-positive genes belonging to the plant species of Brassicacae family were aligned, and the alignment score was calculated using T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment program.

However, toxic components of Aconitum can easily lead to serious arrhythmia, even death (Y. CT., 2009; Zhang XM., 2018). In this study, a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method for the determination of aconitine (AC), mesaconitine (MA) and hypaconitine (HA) was established; The effect of Glycyrrhiza on CYP3A1 / 2 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR; SD rats were given Aconitum and compatibility of Glycyrrhizae and Aconitum by gavage respectively, the blood concentration of toxic components were determined by LC-MS / MS; The CHF rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection of adriamycin (2.5 mg / kg), and were randomly divided into model, Aconitum, the compatibility of Glycyrrhizae and Aconitum and Captopril group, 5 mice/group. After 4 weeks of gavage, the corresponding indexes were detected by ELISA and HPLC. The results showed that Ketoconazole significantly inhibited the metabolites of AC, MA and HA; Glycyrrhiza induced CYP3A gene expression; The level of ALD in the compatibility of Glycyrrhizae and Aconitum group was significantly lower than that in Aconitum group. After intervention with the compatibility of Glycyrrhizae and Aconitum, ATP increased, ADP decreased significantly. In conclusion, we found Glycyrrhiza promoted the metabolism of toxic components of Aconitum by up regulating the expression of CYP3A, and reduced the content of BNP, Ang II and ALD, improved the energy metabolism disorder of myocardium, alleviated the development of CHF."
https://openalex.org/W4283218158,"Siderophores are conditionally essential metabolites used by microbes for environmental iron sequestration. Most Streptomyces strains produce hydroxamate-based desferrioxamine (DFO) siderophores composed of repeating units of N1-hydroxy-cadaverine (or N1-hydroxy-putrescine) and succinate. The DFO biosynthetic operon, desABCD, is highly conserved in Streptomyces; however, expression of desABCD alone does not account for the vast structural diversity within this natural product class. Here, we report the in vitro reconstitution and biochemical characterization of four DesD orthologs from Streptomyces strains that produce unique DFO siderophores. Under in vitro conditions, all four DesD orthologs displayed similar saturation steady-state kinetics (Vmax = 0.9-2.5 μM⋅min-1) and produced the macrocyclic trimer DFOE as the favored product, suggesting a conserved role for DesD in the biosynthesis of DFO siderophores. We further synthesized a structural mimic of N1-hydroxy-N1-succinyl-cadaverine (HSC)-acyl-adenylate, the HSC-acyl sulfamoyl adenosine analog (HSC-AMS), and obtained crystal structures of DesD in the ATP-bound, AMP/PPi-bound, and HSC-AMS/Pi-bound forms. We found HSC-AMS inhibited DesD orthologs (IC50 values = 48-53 μM) leading to accumulation of linear trimeric DFOG and di-HSC at the expense of macrocyclic DFOE. Addition of exogenous PPi enhanced DesD inhibition by HSC-AMS, presumably via stabilization of the DesD-HSC-AMS complex, similar to the proposed mode of adenylate stabilization where PPi remains buried in the active site. In conclusion, our data suggest that acyl-AMS derivatives may have utility as chemical probes and bisubstrate inhibitors to reveal valuable mechanistic and structural insight for this unique family of adenylating enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W4283330500,"The integrated stress response is a network of highly orchestrated pathways activated when cells are exposed to environmental stressors. While global repression of translation is a well-recognized hallmark of the integrated stress response, less is known about the regulation of mRNA stability during stress. DEAD box proteins are a family of RNA unwinding/remodeling enzymes involved in every aspect of RNA metabolism. We previously showed that DEAD box 1 (DDX1) protein accumulates at DNA double-strand breaks during genotoxic stress and promotes DNA double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. Here, we examine the role of DDX1 in response to environmental stress. We show that DDX1 is recruited to stress granules (SGs) in cells exposed to a variety of environmental stressors, including arsenite, hydrogen peroxide, and thapsigargin. We also show that DDX1 depletion delays resolution of arsenite-induced SGs. Using RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identify RNA targets bound to endogenous DDX1, including RNAs transcribed from genes previously implicated in stress responses. We show the amount of target RNAs bound to DDX1 increases when cells are exposed to stress, and the overall levels of these RNAs are increased during stress in a DDX1-dependent manner. Even though DDX1’s RNA-binding property is critical for maintenance of its target mRNA levels, we found RNA binding is not required for localization of DDX1 to SGs. Furthermore, DDX1 knockdown does not appear to affect RNA localization to SGs. Taken together, our results reveal a novel role for DDX1 in maintaining cytoplasmic mRNA levels in cells exposed to oxidative stress.

Eukaryotic cells are routinely exposed to a variety of stressors, from genotoxic stress such as ultraviolet radiation and ionizing radiation (IR) to environmental stress including oxidizing agents and heat shock. Organisms have evolved different mechanisms to minimize cell damage and maximize cell survival when exposed to stress. For example, the DNA damage response pathway is activated immediately after DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation (1Ciccia A. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 179-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2853) Google Scholar), whereas stress granule (SG) formation is rapidly induced upon oxidative stimuli or endoplasmic reticulum stress (2Anderson P. Kedersha N. Ivanov P. Stress granules, P-bodies and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). SGs are membrane-less structures that form in the cytoplasm through liquid–liquid phase separation (3Hofmann S. Kedersha N. Anderson P. Ivanov P. Molecular mechanisms of stress granule assembly and disassembly.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2021; 1868118876Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Protter D.S.W. Parker R. Principles and properties of stress granules.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 668-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). SGs consist of dense stable cores and more dynamic shells that surround the cores (5Jain S. Wheeler J.R. Walters R.W. Agrawal A. Barsic A. Parker R. ATPase-modulated stress granules contain a diverse proteome and substructure.Cell. 2016; 164: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Components of SGs include mRNAs, translation initiation factors, 40S ribosomal subunits, and RNA-binding proteins that regulate mRNA translation, stability, and other aspects of RNA metabolism. SG formation is a reversible process (3Hofmann S. Kedersha N. Anderson P. Ivanov P. Molecular mechanisms of stress granule assembly and disassembly.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2021; 1868118876Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Protter D.S.W. Parker R. Principles and properties of stress granules.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 668-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in SG assembly and disassembly have been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases (6Wolozin B. Ivanov P. Stress granules and neurodegeneration.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2019; 20: 649-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Ramaswami M. Taylor J.P. Parker R. Altered ribostasis: RNA-protein granules in degenerative disorders.Cell. 2013; 154: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar).SG formation is an important part of the elaborate signaling network called integrated stress response (ISR), which is activated when cells are exposed to various forms of environmental stress (8Pakos-Zebrucka K. Koryga I. Mnich K. Ljujic M. Samali A. Gorman A.M. The integrated stress response.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1374-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The key feature of ISR is the suppression of global translation in order to preserve energy for cellular adaptation during stress. In eukaryotes, the central player in this stress-induced translational inhibition is the initiation factor eIF2α. eIF2α is rapidly phosphorylated by different kinases depending on the type of stress (9Donnelly N. Gorman A.M. Gupta S. Samali A. The eIF2alpha kinases: their structures and functions.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 3493-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF2α inhibits eIF2B, the nucleotide exchange factor that converts eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, and limits translation initiation, resulting in the repression of global translation (10Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). However, eIF2α phosphorylation also promotes translation of select genes such as the transcriptional activators ATF4 and ATF5 which in turn promote stress adaptation and cell survival (8Pakos-Zebrucka K. Koryga I. Mnich K. Ljujic M. Samali A. Gorman A.M. The integrated stress response.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1374-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Although eIF2α phosphorylation usually triggers SG formation, SG can also be induced by other translation initiation inhibitors without eliciting eIF2α phosphorylation (11Mazroui R. Sukarieh R. Bordeleau M.E. Kaufman R.J. Northcote P. Tanaka J. et al.Inhibition of ribosome recruitment induces stress granule formation independently of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha phosphorylation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4212-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).In addition to inhibition of mRNA translation, ISR also involves regulation of mRNA stability under stress conditions. SGs are evolutionally conserved structures that are induced by a broad spectrum of environmental stresses. As such, SGs have been proposed to protect mRNAs from degradation during stress (12Anderson P. Kedersha N. Stress granules: the Tao of RNA triage.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), largely based on the findings that SGs contain proteins that recruit mRNAs (13Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W.

Consistent with a role in RNA protection, some types of SG-inducing stressors also inhibit mRNA deadenylation (17Gowrishankar G. Winzen R. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Redich N. Kracht M. Holtmann H.

Translation-independent inhibition of mRNA deadenylation during stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.RNA. 2006; 12: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a process that precedes the degradation of most mRNAs. However, more recent studies reveal that impaired SG assembly does not influence the stability of bulk mRNA during stress in both yeast and mammalian cells (19Bley N. Lederer M. Pfalz B. Reinke C.

In addition, whether mRNAs reside within SGs or remain in the cytosol during stress has little effect on mRNA translation and degradation when cells recover from stress (21Wilbertz J.H. Voigt F.

Here, we investigate the localization of DDX1 in cells exposed to different types of environmental stressors in cancer cell lines. We use DDX1 RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by next-generation sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis to identify targets of endogenous DDX1. We show that DDX1 promotes maintenance of target mRNA levels during oxidative stress. We also show that DDX1’s RNA-binding activity is critical to this activity but dispensable for localization of DDX1 to SGs.

Other laboratories have shown that when cells are treated with arsenite, which induces an oxidative stress response, both overexpressed and endogenous DDX1 colocalize with SG markers such as G3BP1 and YB1 in the cytoplasm (42Ozeki K. Sugiyama M. Akter K.A. Nishiwaki K. Asano-Inami E. Senga T. FAM98A is localized to stress granules and associates with multiple stress granule-localized proteins.Mol.

Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 1994-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate whether DDX1 localizes to SGs as a general response to environmental stress, we treated U2OS cells with arsenite, H2O2 (oxidative stress), heat shock, thapsigargin (ER stress), or MG132 (proteasome stress). Cells were coimmunostained with anti-DDX1 and either anti-TIA1 or anti-G3BP1 antibodies, both of which are well-recognized SG markers. In all cases, DDX1 colocalized with SG markers (Figs. 1 and S1). We also found that DDX1 localizes to SGs in response to environmental stress in cell lines other than U2OS, including HeLa (cervical cancer), BE(2)-C (NB), and human embryonic kidney HEK 293 (Fig. 1) using TIA1 as a marker. Similar results were observed in GM38 (normal fibroblasts) (data not shown). In contrast, no cytoplasmic DDX1 aggregation was observed under nonstressed conditions (Fig. 1). Therefore, localization of DDX1 to SGs appears to be a general cellular response to environmental stress.Roles of DDX1 in SG disassemblySome SG components such as G3BP1 and TDP-43 contribute to SG assembly (45Aulas A. Stabile S. Vande Velde C. Endogenous TDP-43, but not FUS, contributes to stress granule assembly via G3BP.Mol. Neurodegener. 2012; 7: 54Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To examine whether DDX1 plays a role in SG assembly, we depleted DDX1 in U2OS cells using DDX1-specific siRNAs (Fig. S2). Control (scrambled siRNA-transfected) and DDX1-depleted U2OS cells were treated with 0.5 mM arsenite, and SGs were analyzed 20, 30, and 45 min later. Our results show that DDX1 depletion does not affect arsenite-induced SG assembly based on the percentage of cells that are positive for SGs as well as the average number of SGs per cell (anti-TIA1 immunostaining) (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2DDX1 facilitates SG resolution. A and B, U2OS cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA (siControl) or DDX1-specific siRNAs (si1 and si2). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 0.5 mM arsenite for 20, 30, or 45 min, followed by fixation and immunostaining with anti-DDX1 and anti-TIA1 antibodies. The percentage of cells positive for SG staining and the average number of SGs per cell at each time point cell are shown in (A) and (B), respectively.

Anderson P. Ivanov P. Molecular mechanisms of stress granule assembly and disassembly.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2021; 1868118876Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We next examined the effects of DDX1 on SG resolution. Control and DDX1-depleted U2OS cells were treated with 0.5 mM arsenite for 45 min, washed with prewarmed PBS, and the medium replaced. SG analysis was carried out 90 min and 120 min after medium replacement. After 90 min recovery, ∼70% of control cells remained positive for SG immunostaining, in contrast to ∼90% of DDX1-depleted cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Similarly, after 120 min of recovery, ∼10% of control cells retained SGs, in contrast to ∼20% of DDX1-depleted cells. In addition, at both time points, the average SG numbers per cell were ∼2- to 3-fold higher in DDX1-depleted cells compared to control cells (Fig. 2, C and D).A hallmark of ISR is phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. Phosphorylation of eIF2α blocks the exchange of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP and limits translation initiation, which in turn represses global translation (10Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). eIF2α phosphorylation and dephosphorylation coincide with SG formation and clearance, respectively (8Pakos-Zebrucka K. Koryga I. Mnich K. Ljujic M. Samali A. Gorman A.M. The integrated stress response.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1374-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). To examine whether DDX1 plays a role in regulating eIF2α phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, we analyzed eIF2α phosphorylation status in control and DDX1-depleted U2OS cells during stress and recovery. We did not notice any appreciable difference in eIF2α phosphorylation status as the result of DDX1 depletion (Fig. S3). Taken together, our results suggest that DDX1 plays a role in SG disassembly but is dispensable for arsenite-induced SG formation and eIF2α phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.DDX1 subcellular localization in the presence of both environmental and genotoxic stressesWe previously reported that in cells exposed to genotoxic stress, DDX1 rapidly accumulates at DNA DSBs, where it facilitates DSB repair through the homologous recombination pathway (32Li L.

Because cells, and especially cancer cells under treatment, may experience both environmental and genotoxic stresses, we examined DDX1 subcellular localization in cells exposed to both environmental and genotoxic stresses. First, we treated cells with both 5 Gy IR and 0.5 mM arsenite at the same time and examined DDX1 localization 60 min later. This combined treatment resulted in DDX1 localization to both DSBs (marked by γH2AX) in the nucleus and SGs (marked by TIA1) in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Second, we exposed cells to 5 Gy IR, allowed the cells to recover at 37 °C for 30 min and then treated the cells with 0.5 mM arsenite for 60 min. Again, DDX1 was found at both DSBs and SGs (Fig. 3B). Third, we treated the cells with 0.5 mM arsenite for 30 min, then immediately irradiated the cells with 5 Gy, followed by a 60 min recovery period. Interestingly, in this scenario, DDX1 was found predominantly in SGs, with ∼95% of cells showing DDX1 localization to SGs and only ∼10% of cells showing DDX1 recruitment to DSBs (Fig. 3, C and E, F). Fourth, we treated the cells with 0.5 mM arsenite for 30 min, washed away the drug, and allowed the cells to recover for 120 min. Cel"

Propensity score matching and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to analyze the effect of surgery on the prognosis.A total of 4,034 patients from the SEER database were analyzed. Both before and after the propensity score-matching analysis, the prognosis of patients who underwent primary tumor surgery and metastatic surgery was better than that of patients who did not undergo surgery; all were patients with metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma (mSIA) or metastatic small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (mSI-NETs) (all p < .005). Patients with mSIA and adequate lymph node dissection had a longer prognosis than mSIA patients with inadequate lymph node dissection, but this survival benefit was not present in mSI-NET patients. It made no difference in the prognosis of mSIA and mSI-NETs whether localized surgery or intestine-ectomy was performed. Patients with mSIA who underwent primary and metastatic excision plus chemotherapy had the best overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates, whereas mSI-NET patients who underwent primary and metastatic excision had the best overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates (all p < .001).In these carefully selected patients, primary tumor resection and/or metastatic lesion resection significantly improved the survival rates for patients with mSIA and mSI-NETs. The mSIA patients with resectable primary tumors seemed to require a sufficient number of lymph node dissections more than the patients with well-differentiated mSI-NETs."
https://openalex.org/W4283587047,"Aberrant transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) is one of the dominant mechanisms for developing of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Analyzing AR-transcriptional complex related to CRPC is therefore important towards understanding the mechanism of therapy resistance. While studying its mechanism, we observed that a transmembrane protein called neuropilin-2 (NRP2) plays a contributory role in forming a novel AR-transcriptional complex containing nuclear pore proteins. Using immunogold electron microscopy, high-resolution confocal microscopy, chromatin immunoprecipitation, proteomics, and other biochemical techniques, we delineated the molecular mechanism of how a specific splice variant of NRP2 becomes sumoylated upon ligand stimulation and translocates to the inner nuclear membrane. This splice variant of NRP2 then stabilizes the complex between AR and nuclear pore proteins to promote CRPC specific gene expression. Both full-length and splice variants of AR have been identified in this specific transcriptional complex. In vitro cell line-based assays indicated that depletion of NRP2 not only destabilizes the AR-nuclear pore protein interaction but also inhibits the transcriptional activities of AR. Using an in vivo bone metastasis model, we showed that the inhibition of NRP2 led to the sensitization of CRPC cells toward established anti-AR therapies such as enzalutamide. Overall, our finding emphasize the importance of combinatorial inhibition of NRP2 and AR as an effective therapeutic strategy against treatment refractory prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4283265597,"The voltage-gated Na+ channel β1 subunit, encoded by SCN1B, regulates cell surface expression and gating of α subunits and participates in cell adhesion. β1 is cleaved by α/β and γ-secretases, releasing an extracellular domain and intracellular domain (ICD), respectively. Abnormal SCN1B expression/function is linked to pathologies including epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, and cancer. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of secretase cleavage on β1 function in breast cancer cells. Using a series of GFP-tagged β1 constructs, we show that β1-GFP is mainly retained intracellularly, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and endolysosomal pathway, and accumulates in the nucleus. Reduction in endosomal β1-GFP levels occurred following γ-secretase inhibition, implicating endosomes and/or the preceding plasma membrane as important sites for secretase processing. Using live-cell imaging, we also report β1ICD-GFP accumulation in the nucleus. Furthermore, β1-GFP and β1ICD-GFP both increased Na+ current, whereas β1STOP-GFP, which lacks the ICD, did not, thus highlighting that the β1-ICD is necessary and sufficient to increase Na+ current measured at the plasma membrane. Importantly, although the endogenous Na+ current expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells is tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant (carried by Nav1.5), the Na+ current increased by β1-GFP or β1ICD-GFP was TTX-sensitive. Finally, we found β1-GFP increased mRNA levels of the TTX-sensitive α subunits SCN1A/Nav1.1 and SCN9A/Nav1.7. Taken together, this work suggests that the β1-ICD is a critical regulator of α subunit function in cancer cells. Our data further highlight that γ-secretase may play a key role in regulating β1 function in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4283370452,"A semi-active suspension system can effectively improve vehicle ride comfort and handling stability, and the active detection of road information is key to achieving semi-active suspension. To improve the road elevation perception ability of vehicles, this study proposes a continuous multiple scanning recursive matching algorithm based on a single-line LIDAR sensor. Radar recursive scanning is used to obtain the multiple superposition data of echo signals, and coordinate matching is realized between historical scanning data and current scanning data. Simultaneously, the sensor height deviation and pitch angle deviation of the sensors are regressed to obtain an accurate pavement elevation. Considering the control effect of the active vehicle suspension, a vehicle suspension model with seven degrees of freedom is established. The semi-active suspension controller is constructed using a diagonal recursive neural network algorithm, and the neural network weight is trained using a genetic algorithm. In addition, a preview diagonal recursive neural network control strategy for semi-active suspension, based on the combination of road elevation information, is proposed. The results of a hardware-in-the-loop co-simulation, which was conducted based on the Simulink control model and dSPACE real-time simulation, revealed that the ride comfort and stability of the vehicle were improved owing to a preview of the elevation information of the road ahead and the active adjustment of the shock absorber of the suspension system."
https://openalex.org/W4283374479,"Our current understanding of the regulation of gene expression in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo comes from observations of a few genes at a time, as with in situ hybridizations, or observation of gene expression levels without regards to patterning, as with RNA-sequencing. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing however, has the potential to provide new insights into the regulation of gene expression for many genes at once while simultaneously retaining information regarding the position of each nucleus prior to dissociation based on patterned gene expression. In order to establish the use of single-nucleus RNA sequencing in Drosophila embryos prior to cellularization, here we look at gene expression in control and insulator protein, dCTCF, maternal null embryos during zygotic genome activation at nuclear cycle 14. We find that early embryonic nuclei can be grouped into distinct clusters according to gene expression. From both virtual and published in situ hybridizations, we also find that these clusters correspond to spatial regions of the embryo. Lastly, we provide a resource of candidate differentially expressed genes that might show local changes in gene expression between control and maternal dCTCF null nuclei with no detectable differential expression in bulk. These results highlight the potential for single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to reveal new insights into the regulation of gene expression in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo."
https://openalex.org/W4283380823,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea and dehydration in pigs and leads to great economic losses in the commercial swine industry. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of host response to viral infection remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated a novel mechanism by which RALY, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, significantly promotes the degradation of the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein to inhibit viral replication. Furthermore, we identified an interaction between RALY and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (membrane-associated RING-CH 8), as well as the cargo receptor NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa), suggesting that RALY could suppress PEDV replication by degrading the viral N protein through a RALY-MARCH8-NDP52-autophagosome pathway. Collectively, these results suggest a preventive role of RALY against PEDV infection via the autophagy pathway and open up the possibility of inducing RALY in vivo as an effective prophylactic and preventive treatment for PEDV infection."
https://openalex.org/W4283396502,"The recent development of mutant-selective inhibitors for the oncogenic KRASG12C allele has generated considerable excitement. These inhibitors covalently engage the mutant C12 thiol located within the phosphoryl binding loop of RAS, locking the KRASG12C protein in an inactive state. While clinical trials of these inhibitors have been promising, mechanistic questions regarding the reactivity of this thiol remain. Here, we show by NMR and an independent biochemical assay that the pKa of the C12 thiol is depressed (pKa ∼7.6), consistent with susceptibility to chemical ligation. Using a validated fluorescent KRASY137W variant amenable to stopped-flow spectroscopy, we characterized the kinetics of KRASG12C fluorescence changes upon addition of ARS-853 or AMG 510, noting that at low temperatures, ARS-853 addition elicited both a rapid first phase of fluorescence change (attributed to binding, Kd = 36.0 ± 0.7 μM) and a second, slower pH-dependent phase, taken to represent covalent ligation. Consistent with the lower pKa of the C12 thiol, we found that reversible and irreversible oxidation of KRASG12C occurred readily both in vitro and in the cellular environment, preventing the covalent binding of ARS-853. Moreover, we found that oxidation of the KRASG12C Cys12 to a sulfinate altered RAS conformation and dynamics to be more similar to KRASG12D in comparison to the unmodified protein, as assessed by molecular dynamics simulations.

Drugging RAS: know the enemy.Science. 2017; 355: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Recently, anti-RAS drug discovery efforts have taken a massive stride forward with the development of small molecule inhibitors that selectively target tumors carrying the KRASG12C mutant allele (4Goebel L.

The KRASG12C mutation accounts for approximately 12% of KRAS mutations across all human cancers and is the predominant mutation in KRAS-mutant non–small cell lung adenocarcinomas. These novel RAS inhibitors take advantage of the mutated cysteine residue as a covalent tether and bind to KRAS in a previously unknown pocket now known as the Switch II pocket (6Janes M.R. Zhang J.

Kessler L.V. et al.Selective inhibition of oncogenic KRAS output with small molecules targeting the inactive state.Cancer Discov. 2016; 6: 316-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). With these compounds effectively locking KRASG12C in an inactive GDP-bound state, several of these covalent inhibitors have achieved exciting clinical success, with AMG 510 and MRTX849 both showing potent antitumor activity as single agents and in combination studies (8Canon J. Rex K. Saiki A.Y. Mohr C. Cooke K.

Excitingly, AMG 510 (Lumakras, Amgen, Inc) has received accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2021 for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer carrying the KRASG12C mutation.However, despite the potent activity of these clinical compounds, the kinetics and reactivity of KRASG12C inhibitors in general is poorly understood. Previous studies assessing the reactivity for this class of KRAS inhibitors were performed using the inhibitor ARS-853 but faced challenges such as limited inhibitor solubility and lack of intrinsically fluorescent tryptophan residues which impeded analyses (10Hansen R. Peters U. Babbar A. Chen Y. Feng J. Janes M.R. et al.The reactivity-driven biochemical mechanism of covalent KRAS(G12C) inhibitors.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additionally, while the chemical mechanism of Michael addition of Cys12 to acrylamide-based inhibitors such as ARS-853 is well established, with attack of the sulfur on the terminal carbon of the electrophilic alkene accompanied by 1,2 or 1,4 protonation, the exact structural and dynamic mechanisms behind the observed reactivity of KRASG12C to these alkylating inhibitors remain unclear (11Khrenova M.G. Kulakova A.M. Nemukhin A.V. Proof of concept for poor inhibitor binding and efficient formation of covalent adducts of KRASG12C and ARS compounds.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2020; 18: 3069-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the understanding of these processes is critical for the development of future KRAS inhibitors, we sought to resolve these gaps in knowledge. In this study, we characterized the pKa and reactivity of the mutant G12C residue via several direct and indirect methods and demonstrate that the KRASG12C thiol exhibits a depressed pKa. We established and validated a novel Y137W variant of KRASG12C that allows for direct evaluation of KRASG12C inhibitor binding and ligation kinetics. Further, we found that oxidation of the G12C cysteine occurs in solution and in cell cultures and blocks chemical ligation by covalent KRASG12C inhibitors. Lastly, we found that oxidation of KRASG12C to the sulfinate state mimics KRASG12D by molecular dynamics (MD) analyses. Together, our study establishes an assay for future kinetic assessment and development of KRAS inhibitors and suggests a role for oxidation in the regulation of KRASG12C-specific biological functions.ResultsKRASG12C exhibits a perturbed cysteine pKa by chemical modification and NMRPrevious studies from our group and others have shown that several cysteine residues in a subset of RAS superfamily GTPases have a lower pKa relative to that of a free cysteine (12Heo J.

Rho GTPases, oxidation, and cell redox control.Small GTPases. 2014; 5e28579Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). With a lowered pKa, these cysteines are more populated in the reactive thiolate state at physiological pH. We hypothesized that the mutated G12C residue in KRAS would also display a perturbed pKa owing in part to its position within the RAS nucleotide–binding site. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the cysteine reactivity of the G12C residue by monitoring the reaction of KRAS with the fluorogenic agent 4-aminosulfonyl-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (ABD-F). This electrophile reacts with the thiolate state of cysteine residues approximately 10-fold faster than with the protonated state. The core guanine nucleotide-binding domain of native KRAS contains three cysteine residues (C51, C80, C118). While C51 and C80 are buried, C118 is solvent accessible (12Heo J. Campbell S.L. Mechanism of p21Ras S-nitrosylation and kinetics of nitric oxide-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility of ABD-F modification at the solvent accessible site, we introduced a C118S mutation. We previously have shown that this mutation does not impact KRAS biochemical function (16Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Campbell S.L. Structural and functional analysis of a mutant Ras protein that is insensitive to nitric oxide activation.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We tested ABD-F reactivity across a pH range (5.8–8.2) and found that KRASG12C is susceptible to ABD-F modification in a pH-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). From fitting the initial rates of ABD-F modification at different pH values, we estimated the pKa for the KRASG12C thiol to be 7.6 ± 0.1 (Fig. 1B). The negative control KRASG12S/C118S did not show appreciable reactivity to ABD-F.While the reactivity of a cysteine thiol is partially dependent on its surrounding electrostatic environment, the electrophilicity and binding orientation of reacting compounds such as ABD-F will also influence the rate of cysteine modification (17Awoonor-Williams E. Rowley C.N. How reactive are druggable cysteines in protein kinases?.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2018; 58: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, we employed an independent, NMR-based approach to directly assess the pKa of C12 in the absence of small molecules. With NMR backbone assignments readily available for KRASG12C (18Pálfy G. Vida I. Perczel A. 1H, 15N backbone assignment and comparative analysis of the wild type and G12C, G12D, G12V mutants of K-Ras bound to GDP at physiological pH.Biomol.

NMR Assign. 2018; 12: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we acquired 2D NMR 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra and were able to monitor chemical shift perturbations for the C12 residue across a similar pH range as used for ABD-F modification (Fig. 1C). Chemical shifts for the mutant KRASG12C C12 NH cross peaks demonstrated responsive changes across the pH range tested; negligible shifts observed for several control residues indicated minimal structural alterations to KRAS (Fig. 1, D and E). From these data, we found that direct monitoring of KRASG12C chemical shifts by NMR yielded a pKa of 7.6 ± 0.4, similar to the value obtained from ABD-F modification.Design and validation of a fluorescent form of KRASG12CUnderstanding the mechanism behind the observed reactivity of the cancer-associated G12C residue is highly relevant for current and future KRASG12C-specific inhibitor design. However, our understanding of the kinetics of binding and ligation by these KRASG12C-specific inhibitors is currently quite limited. Given the lack of any naturally occurring tryptophan residues in KRAS which could serve as fluorescent sensors of inhibitor association amenable to kinetic analysis, we set out to identify possible sites for introducing a tryptophan as an intrinsic probe in KRAS. Analyzing the sequence conservation of several other RAS GTPases, we found that several members of the RAS subfamily contain a tryptophan at the position analogous to KRAS Y137 (Fig. 2A). Of note, Y137 in KRAS is located at the end of helix α4 and is not involved in any intramolecular interactions. Analysis of published crystal structures for several of these RAS subfamily members show that the analogous tryptophan residues occupy a similar side-chain position, suggesting that mutation of Y137 in KRAS to tryptophan is a conservative substitution that will not likely affect RAS structure or function (Fig. 2, B and C). Additionally, Y137 is distal to the RAS nucleotide-binding site and thus is unlikely to interfere with kinetic studies interrogating the cysteine reactivity of KRASG12C.Figure 2Characterization of the Y137W substitution in the C118S variant of KRASG12C.

D, representative intrinsic nucleotide dissociation monitoring the decrease in mantGDP fluorescence over time after mixing with nonfluorescent GDP, comparing KRASG12C/C118S with and without the Y137W mutation, shows minimal effects of the Y137W mutation on nucleotide exchange activity.

Error bars, mean ± s.e.m. CD, circular dichroism.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that this mutation does not significantly alter protein function, we performed nucleotide exchange analysis on KRASG12C with and without the Y137W mutation. We found that the GDP nucleotide dissociation rates for KRASG12C/Y137W were similar to the control KRASG12C (Fig. 2D). We also tested the effects of the mutation on the thermal stability of KRASG12C using CD spectroscopy and did not observe significant changes in the protein melting temperature or cooperativity of the unfolding transition (Fig. 2E). Further, MD analyses indicate that introduction of the Y137W substitution into KRASG12C does not alter KRAS structure or dynamics (Fig. S1). Together, these data indicate that the Y137W substitution does not significantly alter RAS nucleotide binding or stability, supporting the use of this fluorescent mutant to analyze kinetic behavior.Stopped-flow kinetic studies of KRASG12C interaction with ARS-853 show both fast and slow processes and a functional pKa for inhibitor ligationGeneration of the Y137W mutation in KRASG12C enabled use of this fluorescent residue as a tool to directly monitor fluorescence changes associated with inhibitor binding and ligation to KRASG12C, including the KRASG12C-specific inhibitor ARS-853. ARS-853 is an early model compound that is similar to clinically relevant KRASG12C-specific inhibitors with reactive acrylamide moieties and which has undergone previous kinetic assessment (7Patricelli M.P. Janes M.R. Li L.-S. Hansen R. Peters U.

Biol. 2018; 25: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further, we introduced mutations at the other three cysteine residues of KRASG12C (C51S/C80L/C118S) to generate a “Cys-light” protein to eliminate off-target inhibitor ligation in this assay (5Ostrem J.M. Peters U. Sos M.L. Wells J.A. Shokat K.M. K-Ras(G12C) inhibitors allosterically control GTP affinity and effector interactions.Nature. 2013; 503: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar), generating a KRASG12C/C51S/C80L/C118S/Y137W variant (referred to as KRASCCLW). The “Cys-light” version of KRASG12C is preferable to use in these studies to avoid Cys reactions that could even occur at structurally buried positions if or when the protein spontaneously unfolds and refolds; moreover, “Cys-light” KRASG12C was previously shown to have only minimal effects on overall protein structure (5Ostrem J.M. Peters U. Sos M.L. Wells J.A. Shokat K.M. K-Ras(G12C) inhibitors allosterically control GTP affinity and effector interactions.Nature. 2013; 503: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). The protein was freshly reduced using 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), followed by removal of the DTT prior to kinetic analyses.Stopped flow kinetic experiments conducted at 5 °C to capture data for the fastest reactions revealed that addition of ARS-853 to prereduced KRASCCLW resulted in very rapid, concentration-dependent fluorescence changes up to ∼250 ms (Fig. 3, A and B). We confirmed that the protein and not the inhibitor was responsible for the observed fluorescence changes; the kinetic traces of all reaction mixes, when extrapolated back to the time of mixing, yielded the same fluorescence as KRAS mixed with buffer. No pH dependence of reaction rates was observed, beyond modestly lower rates at pH 9 (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Stopped-flow kinetic studies of KRASCCLW fluorescence changes upon ARS-853 addition show a very fast fluorescence decrease followed by a slower decrease, and a functional pKa of ∼8.2 for the slow step. A, stopped-flow kinetic data of 5 μM KRASCCLW (G12C,”Cys-light”, Y137W) mixed with buffer or ARS-853 at 25, 50, 75, and 100 μM at 5 °C and pH 7.5 demonstrate an initial fast drop in fluorescence (<50 ms). Data shown are representative of three or more independent experiments. B, plots of the pseudo first order rate constant versus ARS-853 concentration at five pH values (average plus or minus the standard error of each) yield a linear fit and an absence of a pH effect up to pH 8.5. C, a further decrease in fluorescence beyond that seen in (A) occurs over ∼500 s at 5 °C (same colors and concentrations as in (A). Data shown are representative of three or more independent experiments. D, pseudo-first order rate constants at 5 °C fit to a hyperbola are consistent with a saturable step (interpreted as covalent modification). As shown, rate constants are strongly affected by pH. E, second-order rate constants (kinact/Ki) for the slow step of KRASCCLW and ARS-853 reactions were fit to a Boltzmann sigmoidal; the ARS-853 functional pKa was found to be 8.21 ± 0.09 at 20 °C. Three colors and marker shapes represent three independent trials, and each data point reports the mean ± SEM for the kinact/Ki value derived from multiple [ARS-853]; all data were used in the final fit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under these conditions, a second, much slower decrease in fluorescence is also observed (from ∼1–500 s, Fig. 3C); in this case, data collected at various pH values show a strong pH effect (Fig. 3D). For this slower step, which can be observed at both 5 °C and 20 °C, the first order decay rate plotted versus inhibitor concentration indicates a saturable interaction (Fig. 3D). Kinetic profiles of covalent enzyme inhibition typically yield a hyperbolic dependence on inhibitor concentration (Equation 1).y=kinact·[ARS]0Ki+[ARS]0.(1) In this equation, y is the first order rate of decay derived from exponential fits of the data, kinact is the rate constant of the irreversible chemical step, Ki is the equilibrium constant corresponding to reversible binding, and [ARS]o is the initial concentration of the ARS-853 inhibitor (11Khrenova M.G. Kulakova A.M. Nemukhin A.V. Proof of concept for poor inhibitor binding and efficient formation of covalent adducts of KRASG12C and ARS compounds.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2020; 18: 3069-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plotting kinact/Ki (which can be determined even when Ki is very high) versus pH indicates a “functional” pKa (associated with the ligation reaction) at 20 °C of 8.21 ± 0.09 (Fig. 3E). A very similar value of 8.15 ± 0.13 is obtained at 5 °C (Fig. S2). Note that these functional pKa values are 0.6 to 0.7 pH units higher than the C12 pKa of the inhibitor-free enzyme determined by NMR.The simplest interpretation of the fast reaction with linear dependence on [I] (observable at 5 °C with ARS-853, Fig. 3, A and B) is that these fluorescence changes represent reversible binding of the inhibitor to the protein. The much slower reaction, with hyperbolic dependence on [I] (Fig. 3, C and D), represents the irreversible chemical reaction between the two (Equation 2).KRASCCLW+Inhibitor(I)⇄k−1k+1KRAS·І→k+2KRAS-І(2) Note that in this kinetic model, k+1 represents kon and k-1 represents koff for reversible inhibitor binding, and Kd can be calculated from the ratio of the two. In addition, k+2 represents kinact and k-2, not shown in the model, is 0 due to the irreversible formation of the covalent bond between KRAS and inhibitor. To establish the most accurate kinetic parameters from these data collected at 5 °C, we conducted global analyses of the raw data (including both the fast and slow reaction data and all inhibitor concentrations) using KinTek Explorer and the kinetic model of Equation 2. Individual rate constants and the computed Kd are shown in Table 1. Averaging the Kd values determined from pH 7.0 to 8.5 yields a Kd of 36.0 ± 0.7 μM at 5 °C. Given the kinetic model used (Equation 2), this is also the Ki value for ARS-853 at 5 °C. At 20 °C, we were no longer able to track the fast rate and therefore could not determine the Kd directly. Instead, we determined Ki and kinact values by conducting hyperbolic fits as recommended by Johnson (20Johnson K.A. Kinetic Analysis for the New Enzymology. Kintek Corporation, Austin TX2019Google Scholar) and then used the kinact/Ki values in the determination of the functional pKa (Figs. 3E and S2).Table 1Rate constant values from global fits of data shown in Figure 3A using KinTek ExplorerpHk +1k −1k +2Kd7.01.35 ± 0.0149.7 ± 0.30.0073 ± 0.000436.8 ± 0.47.51.69 ± 0.0151.1 ± 0.30.0169 ± 0.000530.2 ± 0.38.01.50 ± 0.0151.2 ± 0.30.038 ± 0.00634.2 ± 0.38.51.45 ± 0.0161.7 ± 0.40.099 ± 0.00142.6 ± 0.49.00.976 ± 0.00975.1 ± 0.40.280 ± 0.00377.0 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab As several KRASG12C-targeting inhibitors are now in late-stage clinical trials (8Canon J.

We again observed a rapid drop in fluorescence upon mixing AMG 510 with the protein. However, this fluorescence decrease, unlike for ARS-853, occurred within the deadtime of the instrument (∼1.5 ms) at 5 °C, indicating that binding equilibration is much faster with this compound (Fig. 4A). Evaluating the kinetics at 20 °C, the rates of fluorescence decay were higher at every concentration with AMG 510 relative to ARS-853, although the Ki was also higher for AMG 510 than for ARS-853 (Figs. 4B and S3). Evaluation of the kinact/Ki values for AMG 510 versus ARS-853 at three different pH values showed that AMG 510 exhibits a >5-fold larger value than ARS-853 independent of pH (Table S1 and Fig. S3).Figure 4Kinetic studies of KRASCCLW fluorescence changes with increasing inhibitor concentrations (at 20 °C) are faster for AMG 510 than for ARS-853. A, stopped-flow kinetic data of 5 μM KRASCCLW mixed with buffer or AMG 510 at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μM at 20 °C and pH 8.6 (faster fluorescence decreases reflect higher concentrations of inhibitor) demonstrate faster kinetics for AMG 510 reactions than for “slow step” reactions with ARS-853. B, plots of the observed rates versus inhibitor concentrations suggest very high Ki values for both inhibitors (Ki > 100 μM) under these conditions.

Biol. 2018; 25: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), we conducted experiments at 20 °C (the Hansen study was conducted at room temperature) and pH 7.5 using the reaction buffer described in their study (20 mM Hepes, with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM MgCl2). The buffer used in our studies (MHT buffer in Experimental procedures) lacks DTT and has 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2, and also included 50 mM each of MES and Tris in addition to 50 mM Hepes to allow experiments at varying pH. Surprisingly, while the two buffers yielded overlapping results at ARS-853 concentrations up to 150 μM, the DTT-containing buffer exhibited visible saturation behavior at higher ARS-853 concentrations of 200 μM and above, whereas the rate constant in MHT buffer continues to rise nearly linearly up to 300 μM (Fig. S4). Comparing our results with those from Hansen et al.(10Hansen R. Peters U. Babbar A. Chen Y. Feng J. Janes M.R. et al.The reactivity-driven biochemical mechanism of covalent KRAS(G12C) inhibitors.Nat.

Our experiments reveal how dependent on the buffer conditions these values are, as the Ki, along with the kinact, appears to be much higher in our MHT buffer at pH 7.5 (on the other hand, kinact/Ki in MHT buffer is only modestly different, at 336 ± 45 M−1 s−1).KRASG12C is sensitive to oxidative modification in vitro and in NIH 3T3 cellsKRAS and other RAS superfamily GTPases have previously been shown to be sensitive to cysteine oxidation bot"

Yet, laboratory settings differ from in-situ and therefore may elicit different perceptions. The present study explores the ecological validity of soundscape reproduction in the laboratory using first-order Ambisonics and of different modes of questionnaire administration. Furthermore, it investigates the influence of the contextual factors of time of day, day of the week, and location on site on soundscape evaluations in situ and in the laboratory, based on the Swedish Soundscape Quality Protocol. We first tested measurement invariance between the computer-based and pen-and-paper administration of the soundscape questionnaire. We then investigated the influence of the above-mentioned contextual factors on soundscape evaluations, as well as the effect of stimuli selection in the laboratory. The analyses confirmed the underlying dimensions of proposed soundscape assessment questionnaires, confirmed metric invariance between computer and pen-and-paper, and revealed significant influences of time, day, and location on soundscape scales. This research represents a critical step in rigorously assessing soundscape evaluations in the laboratory and establishes solid evidence for the use of both in situ and laboratory soundscape studies."
https://openalex.org/W4283587281,"The incidence of hospital- and community-acquired infections has been dramatically increased worldwide. Accordingly, hands hygiene and the use of disinfectants have been increased leading to the expansion in hand sanitizers production to meet public demand. This study was conducted to assess the efficiency of common disinfectants in the market of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in inhibiting the microbial growth during the time of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Five bacterial strains of commonly hospital-acquired infections (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis) (ATCC reference strains and clinical isolates) were examined for their susceptibility against 18 disinfectants collected from the Saudi market. The tested 18 disinfectants were broadly clustered into different groups based on their active chemical composition as following: 12 products contained alcohol, 2 products had chlorhexidine, 3 products contained mixed concentration of alcohol/chlorhexidine and 1 product had a mixture of chlorhexidine/Hexamidine/Chlorocresol. By measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), our results revealed that all the 18 disinfectants have reduced the microbial growth of all the tested strains. Generally, the MICs and the MBCs for the clinical strains are higher than those of the reference strains. Taken together, our findings showed that all tested products have high disinfectants' killing rate against microbes of different origins, which suggest the high quality of these disinfectants and the good surveillance practice by the local authorities in Saudi Arabia."
https://openalex.org/W4283310982,"One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in extracellular plaques. The direct precursor of Aβ is the carboxyl-terminal fragment β (or C99) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). C99 is detected at elevated levels in Alzheimer's disease brains, and its intracellular accumulation has been linked to early neurotoxicity independently of Aβ. Despite this, the causes of increased C99 levels are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that APP interacts with the clathrin vesicle adaptor AP-1 (adaptor protein 1), and we map the interaction sites on both proteins. Using quantitative kinetic trafficking assays, established cell lines and primary neurons, we also show that this interaction is required for the transport of APP from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes. In addition, disrupting AP-1-mediated transport of APP alters APP processing and degradation, ultimately leading to increased C99 production and Aβ release. Our results indicate that AP-1 regulates the subcellular distribution of APP, altering its processing into neurotoxic fragments."
https://openalex.org/W4283323578,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are intracellular organelles that dynamically regulate lipids and energy homeostasis in the cell. LDs can grow through either local lipid synthesis or LD fusion. However, how lipids involving in LD fusion for LD growth is largely unknown. Here, we show that genetic mutation of acox-3 (acyl-CoA oxidase), maoc-1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase), dhs-28 (3-hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and daf-22 (3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase), all involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, led to rapid fusion of adjacent LDs to form giant LDs (gLDs). Mechanistically, we show that dysfunction of peroxisomal β-oxidation results in the accumulation of long-chain fatty acid-CoA and phosphocholine, which may activate the sterol-binding protein 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein to promote gLD formation. Furthermore, we found that inactivation of either FAT-2 (delta-12 desaturase) or FAT-3 and FAT-1 (delta-15 desaturase and delta-6 desaturase, respectively) to block the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with three or more double bonds (n≥3-PUFAs) fully repressed the formation of gLDs; in contrast, dietary supplementation of n≥3-PUFAs or phosphocholine bearing these PUFAs led to recovery of the formation of gLDs in peroxisomal β-oxidation-defective worms lacking PUFA biosynthesis. Thus, we conclude that n≥3-PUFAs, distinct from other well-known lipids and proteins, promote rapid LD fusion leading to LD growth."
https://openalex.org/W4283331367,"The solute carrier 1A family comprises a group of membrane proteins that act as dual-function amino acid transporters and chloride (Cl-) channels and includes the alanine serine cysteine transporters (ASCTs) as well as the excitatory amino acid transporters. ASCT2 is regarded as a promising target for cancer therapy, as it can transport glutamine and other neutral amino acids into cells and is upregulated in a range of solid tumors. The compound L-γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA) is widely used in studies probing the role of ASCT2 in cancer biology; however, the mechanism by which GPNA inhibits ASCT2 is not entirely clear. Here, we used electrophysiology and radiolabelled flux assays to demonstrate that GPNA activates the Cl- conductance of ASCT2 to the same extent as a transported substrate, whilst not undergoing the full transport cycle. This is a previously unreported phenomenon for inhibitors of the solute carrier 1A family but corroborates a body of literature suggesting that the structural requirements for transport are distinct from those for Cl- channel formation. We also show that in addition to its currently known targets, GPNA inhibits several of the excitatory amino acid transporters. Together, these findings raise questions about the true mechanisms of its anticancer effects."
https://openalex.org/W4283366664,"Cancers are caused by genomic alterations that may be inherited, induced by environmental carcinogens, or caused due to random replication errors. Postinduction of carcinogenicity, mutations further propagate and drastically alter the cancer genomes. Although a subset of driver mutations has been identified and characterized to date, most cancer-related somatic mutations are indistinguishable from germline variants or other noncancerous somatic mutations. Thus, such overlap impedes appreciation of many deleterious but previously uncharacterized somatic mutations. The major bottleneck arises due to patient-to-patient variability in mutational profiles, making it difficult to associate specific mutations with a given disease outcome. Here, we describe a newly developed technique Continuous Representation of Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning-based method that allows us to generate numerical vector representations of mutations, thereby enabling numerous machine learning-based tasks. We demonstrate three major applications of CRCS; first, we show how CRCS can help detect cancer-related somatic mutations in the absence of matched normal samples, which has applications in cell-free DNA-based assessment of tumor mutation burden. Second, the proposed approach also enables identification and exploration of driver genes; our analyses implicate DMD, RSK4, OFD1, WDR44, and AFF2 as potential cancer drivers. Finally, we used CRCS to score individual mutations in a tumor sample, which was found to be predictive of patient survival in bladder urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. Taken together, we propose CRCS as a valuable computational tool for analysis of the functional significance of individual cancer mutations."

This trial was undertaken with an aim to evaluate the synergistic effect of probiotic, chicory root powder and coriander seed powder on the performance and gut health of broiler chicken. For this purpose, a total of 240 day-old broiler chicks were randomly allotted to six dietary treatments with 8 replicates of 5 birds in each. Treatment groups included T 1 as control i.e., basal diet (BD) without any growth promoter and T 2 —BD + antibiotic (BMD 0.05%). In the remaining experimental diets, T 3 —probiotic (@ 0.01%) + chicory root powder (@ 1.0%), T 4 —probiotic (@ 0.01%) + coriander seed powder (@ 1.5%), T 5 —chicory root powder (@ 1.0%) + coriander seed powder (@ 1.5%) and T 6 —probiotic (@ 0.01%) + chicory root powder (@ 1.0%) + coriander seed powder (@ 1.5%). The results indicated that supplementation of probiotic + chicory (T 3 ), probiotic + coriander (T 4 ), chicory + coriander (T 5 ) and probiotic + chicory + coriander (T 6 ) in combination resulted in significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher weight gain and better FCR compared to control and antibiotic groups at 42 d of age. Supplementation of different dietary groups did not show any significant (P&gt;0.05) effect on feed intake of broilers. Supplementation of all the test diets (T 3 to T 6 ) significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), glutathione reductase (GSHRx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity when compared to control and antibiotic groups at 42 d of age. Supplementation of all the test diets (T 3 to T 6 ) significantly (P&lt;0.05) lowered the pH in the gut, increased Lactobacillus counts, and reduced E . coli and Salmonella counts in the ileum compared to control and antibiotic groups. Supplementation of all the test diets (T 3 to T 6 ) significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the villus height (VH), crypt depth (CD), VH:CD ratio and villus width (VW) in the duodenum and only VH and CD in the ileum compared to control and antibiotic groups. Significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher jejunal VH and VW and increased the goblet cell number in duodenum, jejunum and ileum was recorded in all test diets (T 3 to T 6 ) compared to control and antibiotic groups. Therefore, combinations of probiotic (0.01%), chicory root powder (1.0%) and coriander seed powder (1.5%) can be used as feed additive for improving performance and gut health of broiler chicken."
https://openalex.org/W4283579057,"The wolf is a generalist-opportunistic predator that displays diverse and remarkably adaptable feeding strategies across its range with local adaptations to certain prey species depending on their availability and vulnerability. The multi-prey system of the Slovak Carpathians supports important portion of the European wolf population; however, it has been markedly understudied. We evaluated winter diet composition and prey selection of Slovak wolves based on 321 scat samples collected between September–April within four different study areas during 2015–2017. The winter diet of wolves in the Slovak Carpathians was characterized by a 98% occurrence of wild large-sized and medium-sized ungulates with red deer occurring in wolf scats most often, consistent with their highest density among other wild ungulates. However, by comparing the consumption with availability of wild prey, we found that wolves in fact selected for wild boar especially in areas with higher altitudinal range, while selected for red deer in areas with low altitudinal range where this prey species was more spatially predictable. Although wolves showed the potential to switch between red deer and wild boar when their density increases, we found that this variation can be rather linked to changing prey vulnerability, which is dependent on particular environmental conditions at local scale such as topography and snow accumulation. The present study provides valuable insights into the winter foraging ecology of Slovak wolves in a multi-prey system of the Carpathians and allows for practical implications in the management of the rapidly increasing populations of wild ungulates across Europe."

To study the causes for the negative energy balance associated with cachexia, we assessed the impact of sulfamidase deficiency and heparan sulfate storage on energy homeostasis and metabolism in a mouse model of type IIIa mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS IIIa, Sanfilippo A syndrome). At 12-weeks of age, MPS IIIa mice exhibited fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia compared with wildtype mice, with a reduction of white and brown adipose tissues. Partitioning of dietary [3H]triolein showed a marked increase in intestinal uptake and secretion, whereas hepatic production and clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins did not differ from wildtype controls. Uptake of dietary triolein was also elevated in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and notable increases in beige adipose tissue occurred, resulting in hyperthermia, hyperphagia, hyperdipsia, and increased energy expenditure. Furthermore, fasted MPS IIIa mice remained hyperthermic when subjected to low temperature but became cachexic and profoundly hypothermic when treated with a lipolytic inhibitor. We demonstrated that the reliance on increased lipid fueling of BAT was driven by a reduced ability to generate energy from stored lipids within the depot. These alterations arose from impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion, resulting in increased mitochondria content in beige and BAT. Finally, we show that increased mitochondria content in BAT and postprandial dyslipidemia was partially reversed upon 5-week treatment with recombinant sulfamidase. We hypothesize that increased BAT activity and persistent increases in energy demand in MPS IIIa mice contribute to the negative energy balance observed in patients with MPS IIIa."

Moreover, in Malaria endemic area are frequently observed Malaria-enteroparasite co-infections associated with the modulation of inflammatory response. In this aspect, biomarkers play an important role in the disease prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate inflammatory mediators in malaria during coinfection with enteroparasites. A subset of serum samples already collected was analyzed and divided into four groups: Malaria (n = 34), Co-infected (n = 116), Enteroparasite (n = 120) and Control (n = 95). The serum levels of sTREM-1 and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. TNF-α, and IL-10 levels were previously carried out by flow cytometry. Higher serum levels of sTREM-1 and IL-6 were showed in malaria patients compared to healthy controls. In co-infected malarial patients sTREM-1 serum levels were similar to control group. Interestingly, co-infected malaria patients showed IL-6 serum levels decreased compared to individuals only infected with P . vivax . However, in Malaria patients and co-infected there was a positive correlation between the IL-6 and IL-10 levels (P &lt; 0.0001). This is the first report of sTREM-1 levels in P . vivax infected. Moreover, the results revealing a divergent effect of co-infection with the increased balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and reduced IL-6 levels but increases the anemia occurrence. The results also highlight the potential use of IL-6 as a biomarker for P . vivax and enteroparasites coinfection."

However, no research to date has shown whether individuals understand how their everyday activities relate to their SWB. Furthermore, the assessment of activities has been limited to predefined types of activities and/or closed-ended questions. In two studies, we examine the relationship between self-reported everyday activities and SWB, while allowing individuals to express their activities freely by allowing open-ended responses that were then analyzed with state-of-the-art ( transformers-based ) Natural Language Processing. In study 1 ( N = 284), self-reports of Yesterday’s Activities did not significantly relate to SWB, whereas activities reported as having the most impact on SWB in the past four weeks had small but significant correlations to most of the SWB scales ( r = .14 –.23, p &lt; .05). In Study 2 (N = 295), individuals showed strong agreement with each other about activities that they considered to increase or decrease SWB (AUC = .995). Words describing activities that increased SWB related to physically and cognitively active activities and social activities (“football”, “meditation”, “friends”), whereas words describing activities that decreased SWB were mainly activity features related to imbalance (“too”, “much”, “enough”). Individuals reported both activities and descriptive words that reflect their SWB, where the activity words had generally small but significant correlations to SWB ( r =. 17 –.33, p &lt; .05) and the descriptive words had generally strong correlations to SWB ( r = .39–63, p &lt; .001). We call this correlational gap the well-being/activity description gap and discuss possible explanations for the phenomenon."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of thermocycling on the fracture resistance of different types of screw-cement-retained implant-supported zirconia-based restoration. Two experimental groups (monolithic zirconia and porcelain-veneered zirconia) and a control group of porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations were fabricated via CAD-CAM ( n = 14 per group). Half of the specimens of each group ( n = 7) were subjected to 10000 thermal cycles. The compressive force was applied and the force leading to fracture was measured by using a Universal Testing Machine. The fractured modes were classified under a scanning electron microscope. The data were analyzed through two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and independent samples t-test ( α = 0.05). Among the non-thermocycled subgroups, the monolithic zirconia specimens were significantly more fracture-resistant than the porcelain-veneered zirconia and porcelain-fused-to-metal groups ( P &lt;0.05); but it was not the same with aging ( P &gt;0.05). Thermocycling decreased the fracture resistance of all groups; however, the difference was not statistically significant ( P &lt;0.05). The monolithic zirconia presented higher fracture resistance than the bilayered restorations for screw-cement retained implant-supported restorations. Thermocycling decreased the fracture resistance of all types of restorations insignificantly which can be clinically important."

However, the bulk tissue approach did not discriminate between the different cell types present in the tissue. The present work utilizes single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) to augment the temporal gene expression profiles with high resolution transcriptome data for each major cell type in the MNTB at P3, a time point coinciding with the initiation of CH growth in mouse (3Holcomb P.S.

We take an unbiased approach to investigating intercellular communication and uncover directional signaling patterns for the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), Delta-Notch, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways. We demonstrate that structural expansion of the vascular network in the MNTB correlates with TGFβ, VEGF, and Delta-Notch signaling, all prominent pathways connected to angiogenesis (23Mancuso M.R. Kuhnert F. Kuo C.H. Developmental angiogenesis of the central nervous system.Lymphat. Res. Biol. 2008; 6: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additionally, we utilize a transgenic Notch reporter mouse line (24Duncan A.W. Rattis F.M. DiMascio L.N. Congdon K.L. Pazianos G. Zhao C. et al.Integration of Notch and Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) to confirm active Delta-Notch signaling in VACs. Furthermore, we show that KO of Fgf9 signaling in the MNTB principal neurons results in an early onset of glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) expression, suggesting that neuronal Fgf9 inhibits expression of Gfap. In addition to effects of neuronal Fgf9 KO on astrocytes, we identify an association between Fgf9 signaling and control of the extracellular matrix and CH terminal size. The MNTB, along with other brain regions such as the spinal cord, deep cerebellar nuclei, and cerebral cortex, is highly enriched for the PNN extracellular matrix structure (25Bekku Y. Su W.

The perineuronal net and the control of CNS plasticity.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 349: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The protein components of the PNNs in the MNTB have been well characterized at maturity (11Blosa M. Sonntag M. Brückner G. Jäger C. Seeger G. Matthews R.T. et al.Unique features of extracellular matrix in the mouse medial nucleus of the trapezoid body-implications for physiological functions.Neuroscience. 2013; 228: 215-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and we previously demonstrated a timeline for the expression of several PNN components during development (12Kolson D.R.

Neurobiol. 2016; 76: 166-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Now, we define cell type contributions of distinct PNN components using scRNA-Seq data and provide evidence for cell-to-cell communications that coordinate the expression of PNN components. We show that genetic deletion of Fgf9 from principal neurons is accompanied by increased expression of brevican (Bcan), which is astrocyte enriched and an integral component of PNNs, as well as larger CH terminal size. This study provides foundational insights into how neuron–astrocyte FGF signaling has functional impacts on astrocyte maturation, as well as extracellular matrix and synaptic remodeling throughout the nervous system.ResultsHierarchical clustering of single cell transcriptomes identifies all major classes of cells in the early postnatal MNTBIn order to obtain unbiased transcriptome data for the major cell types in the MNTB, we performed scRNA-Seq analysis on dissociated cells isolated from microdissected MNTB tissue in P3 mice. Cre-positive mice from the Engrailed1(En1)-Cre;Ai9 cross, which exclusively labels MNTB neurons with tdTomato (4Altieri S.C. Jalabi W. Zhao T. Romito-DiGiacomo R.R. Maricich S.M.

We generated scRNA-Seq libraries from 305 single cells in the MNTB using the Fluidigm C1 system. Libraries from 285 cells were chosen for deep sequencing analysis (Illumina HiSeq instrument; see Experimental procedures) after an initial quality check (Illumina MiSeq instrument; see Experimental procedures) (Fig. S1). After quality control filtering on the deep sequencing data, 215 cells were used for subsequent analysis. The single cell libraries had an average of 8475 genes expressed per cell, with a range of 5804 to 11,207 genes (Fig. S2). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these scRNA-Seq data revealed five major transcriptome classes in the MNTB (Fig. 1; neuronal cluster 1; N1; light blue n = 125 cells; neuronal cluster 2; N2; dark blue n = 38 cells; astrocyte cluster; light green n = 22 cells; oligodendrocyte cluster; dark green n = 19 cells; VAC cluster; pink n = 11 cells).After clustering, each group was identified as a specific cell type based on the expression of marker genes. Figure 2 shows the expression levels of three examples of well-established markers for each of the major cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and VACs (endothelial cells/pericytes combined). The two neuronal clusters (light blue and dark blue) were identified as neurons using genes known to be expressed in MNTB neurons, including the calcium ion–binding protein (Calbindin1; Calb1), the GABA receptor subunit (Gabra5), and the NMDA receptor subunit (Grin2a), among others. MNTB neurons are Calb1-positive by P8 (28Friauf E. Transient appearance of calbindin-D28k-positive neurons in the superior olivary complex of developing rats.J. Comp.

Furthermore, the two neuronal clusters had the highest levels of tdTomato transcript, providing a validation of the cell clustering approach (Fig. S6, p ≤ 0.005).

Other common oligodendrocyte-associated transcripts that were detected were 2′3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′ phosphodiesterase (Cnp) (35Braun P.E. Sandillon F. Edwards A. Matthieu J.M. Privat A.

Genes differentially expressed in each cluster were selected using a twofold differential expression cutoff and false discovery rate (FDR) ≤0.05 based on a previously described scRNA-Seq analysis workflow (38Lun A.T.

Thus, it is not likely that the two neuronal clusters represent distinct populations of neurons but rather that the clusters are defined by the cumulative effect of relatively moderate differences in the levels of commonly expressed transcripts. In a second round of analysis, each cluster was compared to the average of all other clusters.

A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted to identify the impact of economic factors and living place on students’ choice of and preparation for medical school. The survey was administered to high school teachers with career advisory roles, as they support and likely influence students’ choice and decision on this matter. Responses totaling 1,094 were obtained from 1,746 high schools across Japan. The ratio of high schools with two or more students enrolled in medical schools every year is higher in private schools, those with high tuition, and those located in big cities. Approximately 66.8% of the respondents agreed that ""It is difficult for students in economically disadvantaged families to enroll in medical schools;"" 42.0% agreed that ""Some students gave up on aspiring to enter medical schools because they could not afford it,"" and 61.2% agreed that ""Students living in urban areas are more likely to enroll in medical schools."" When asked about the percentage of students attending prep school among those aspiring for a medical career, significantly more respondents from private versus public high schools answered ""80% or more."" When asked about the percentage of parents who are doctors or dentists among students aspiring for a medical career, significantly more respondents from private versus public high schools answered ""50% or more.” The results suggest that students from lower-income families and those living in rural areas are more likely to be disadvantaged when choosing a medical career (because of financial difficulties) than those who live in urban areas and come from wealthier families. The results imply that economic and geographical divides in medical admission are reflected in high school teachers’ perception of and support provided to students."

As far as we know, it is the first Taekwondo competition that uses physical fitness test (PFT) scores as the 8-in-4 selection criteria. The results show that the probability of the final total score of the series of championships entering the top 8 or top 3 is exponentially related to PFT results. It finds that athletes with better PFT scores are more likely to enter the quarterfinals. Among athletes entering the semifinals, the athlete with the best physical fitness has the greatest probability of winning the championship. The difference in physical fitness between athletes is mainly reflected in the 30-meter sprint. Overall, the competitive performance of professional Taekwondo athletes is significantly positively correlated with their physical fitness, especially for female Taekwondo athletes. Through the results obtained, it is concluded that Taekwondo athletes need to strengthen physical training, specifically enhancing the explosive power."
https://openalex.org/W4283582282,"Background Increasing both the frequency and quality of social interactions within treatments for anxiety and depressive disorders in older adults may improve their mental health outcomes and quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and cost utility of an enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) plus social participation program in a sample of older adults with depression and/or anxiety. Methods A total of 172 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older with an anxiety and/or depressive disorder will be randomly allocated to either an enhanced CBT plus social participation program (n = 86) or standard CBT (n = 86). Both treatments will be delivered during 12 weekly individual sessions utilising structured manuals and workbooks. Participants will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome evaluates mean change in clinician-rated diagnostic severity of anxiety and depressive disorders from baseline to post-treatment (primary endpoint) based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Secondary outcomes evaluate changes in symptomatology on self-report anxiety and depression measures, as well as changes in social/community participation, social network, and perceived social support, loneliness, quality of life, and use of health services. Economic benefits will be evaluated using a cost-utility analysis to derive the incremental cost utility ratios for the enhanced CBT program. Discussion Outcomes from this study will provide support for the establishment of improved psychosocial treatment for older adults with anxiety and/or depression. Study outcomes will also provide health systems with a clear means to reduce the impact of poor emotional health in older age and its associated economic burden. In addition to the empirical validation of a novel treatment, the current study will contribute to the current understanding of the role of social participation in older adult wellbeing.

The 1,200 km Pan Borneo Highway project (PBH) in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, is constructing new highways and up-grading 2-lane roads to 4-lane highways. We assessed the potential impact of the PBH on communities using three width scenarios of 50m, 75m and 100m for planned highway alignments, and identified potentially impacted dwellings and community lands. We estimated that 65-93 villages will be impacted, and that 1,712-7,093 dwellings and 3,420-6,695 ha of community lands (e.g. paddy, oil palm smallholdings and rubber) may be lost to the PBH. Due to land tenure technicalities, many affected households may not get compensation for the loss of their homes and lands. The PBH will disproportionally impact Sabah's Indigenous Peoples, with the Kadazandusun most affected. For this study to be constructive, we provide a low impact alternative alignment for a part of the PBH; discuss the socio-economic and cultural impacts of the PBH, and offer some perspectives on current planning procedures in Sabah to support more sustainable and equitable development."
https://openalex.org/W4283321406,"The ion-pumping NQR complex is an essential respiratory enzyme in the physiology of many pathogenic bacteria. This enzyme transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone through several cofactors, including riboflavin (vitamin B2). NQR is the only enzyme reported that is able to use riboflavin as a cofactor. Moreover, the riboflavin molecule is found as a stable neutral semiquinone radical. The otherwise highly reactive unpaired electron is stabilized via an unknown mechanism. Crystallographic data suggested that riboflavin might be found in a superficially located site in the interface of NQR subunits B and E. However, this location is highly problematic, as the site does not have the expected physiochemical properties. In this work, we have located the riboflavin-binding site in an amphipathic pocket in subunit B, previously proposed to be the entry site of sodium. Here, we show that this site contains absolutely conserved residues, including N200, N203, and D346. Mutations of these residues decrease enzymatic activity and specifically block the ability of NQR to bind riboflavin. Docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these residues participate directly in riboflavin binding, establishing hydrogen bonds that stabilize the cofactor in the site. We conclude that riboflavin is likely bound in the proposed pocket, which is consistent with enzymatic characterizations, thermodynamic studies, and distance between cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W4283331772,"Type I cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGIs) are important components of various signaling pathways and are canonically activated by nitric oxide- and natriuretic peptide-induced cGMP generation. However, some reports have shown that PKGIα can also be activated in vitro by oxidizing agents. Using in vitro kinase assays, here, we found that purified PKGIα stored in PBS with Flag peptide became oxidized and activated even in the absence of oxidizing agent; furthermore, once established, this activation could not be reversed by reduction with DTT. We demonstrate that activation was enhanced by addition of Cu2+ before storage, indicating it was driven by oxidation and mediated by trace metals present during storage. Previous reports suggested that PKGIα Cys43, Cys118, and Cys196 play key roles in oxidation-induced kinase activation; we show that activation was reduced by C118A or C196V mutations, although C43S PKGIα activation was not reduced. In contrast, under the same conditions, purified PKGIβ activity only slightly increased with storage. Using PKGIα/PKGIβ chimeras, we found that residues throughout the PKGIα-specific autoinhibitory loop were responsible for this activation. To explore whether oxidants activate PKGIα in H9c2 and C2C12 cells, we monitored vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation downstream of PKGIα. While we observed PKGIα Cys43 crosslinking in response to H2O2 (indicating an oxidizing environment in the cells), we were unable to detect increased vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation under these conditions. Taken together, we conclude that while PKGIα can be readily activated by oxidation in vitro, there is currently no direct evidence of oxidation-induced PKGIα activation in vivo."

The fully reduced flavin (hydroquinone, HQ) cofactor is required for the catalysis of both types of these photolyases. On the other hand, flavin cofactor in the semireduced state, semiquinone, can be utilized by photolyase homologs, the cryptochromes. However, the evolutionary process of the transition of the functional states of flavin cofactors in photolyases and cryptochromes remains mysterious. In this work, we investigated three representative photolyases (Escherichia coli CPD photolyase, Microcystis aeruginosa DASH, and Phaeodactylum tricornutum 6-4 photolyase). We show that the residue at a single site adjacent to the flavin cofactor (corresponding to Ala377 in E. coli CPD photolyase, hereafter referred to as site 377) can fine-tune the stability of the HQ cofactor. We found that, in the presence of a polar residue (such as Ser or Asn) at site 377, HQ was stabilized against oxidation. Furthermore, this polar residue enhanced the photorepair activity of these photolyases both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, substitution of hydrophobic residues, such as Ile, at site 377 in these photolyases adversely affected the stability of HQ. We speculate that these differential residue preferences at site 377 in photolyase proteins might reflect an important evolutionary event that altered the stability of HQ on the timeline from expression of photolyases to that of cryptochromes."

We also show that phosphorylation by CK1δ or CK1ε significantly increased the solubility of FUS in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In transgenic Drosophila that overexpress wt or P525L ALS-mutant human FUS in the retina or in neurons, we found coexpression of human CK1δ or its Drosophila isologue Dco in the photoreceptor neurons significantly ameliorated the observed retinal degeneration, and neuronal coexpression of human CK1δ extended fly life span. Taken together, our data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of the assembly and toxicity of FUS through CK1δ/CK1ε-mediated phosphorylation, which could represent a potential therapeutic target in FUS proteinopathies."

Many approved drugs, including antivirals, are small-molecule inhibitors of disease-causing proteins. Such inhibitors often elicit resistance during treatment. Chaturvedi et al. propose new, feedback-disruptor (FD) antivirals that efficiently cure infected cells from viruses and minimize the chance of resistance, providing a new paradigm to treat viral infections and possibly other diseases. Feedback is so ubiquitous that we barely notice it. While walking, riding a bicycle, or driving, our nervous system applies negative feedback automatically to counteract undesired deviations that would make us fall or stray from our path. Conversely, if we want to dislodge some large swaying object, we apply positive feedback by pushing along the current deviation. Overall, negative feedback is a stabilizing reaction that opposes deviations, whereas positive feedback reinforces deviations with a destabilizing effect. Nervous systems are sufficient, but not necessary, at learning skills requiring feedback. Indeed, evolution has “taught” all types of cells and their virus archenemies to apply feedback, which helps them find food, avoid harm, and reproduce. A typical mechanism underlying cellular and viral feedback is gene autoregulation, which occurs when a gene encodes a protein that controls transcription of the same gene (Alon, 2019Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits.Second edition. CRC Press, 2019Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, bacterial genes that control response to various stressors or metabolites commonly repress themselves, probably because negative feedback can reduce fluctuations, response times, and unnecessary regulator expression (Alon, 2019Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits.Second edition. CRC Press, 2019Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Positive feedback is more common among genes controlling cell fate choice and differentiation (Balázsi et al., 2011Balázsi G. van Oudenaarden A. Collins J.J.

Genetic feedback has been observed and studied in natural systems (Alon, 2019Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits.Second edition. CRC Press, 2019Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and has been engineered in synthetic biological systems (Nevozhay et al., 2009Nevozhay D. Adams R.M. Murphy K.F. Josić K. Balázsi G.

USA. 2009; 106: 5123-5128https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0809901106Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), but its relevance as a drug target has remained unexplored. A new study in this issue (Chaturvedi et al., 2022Chaturvedi S. Pablo M. Wolf M. Rosas-Rivera D. Calia G. Kumar A.J. Vardi N. Du K. Glazier J. Ke R. et al.Disrupting autorepression circuitry generates “open-loop lethality” to yield escape-resistant antiviral agents.Cell. 2022; 185: 2086-2102.e22https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) shows how novel nucleic acid therapy can target feedback regulation to effectively eliminate herpesvirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections, while minimizing the chance of antiviral resistance. Most living humans carry latent, lifelong cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. CMV can activate and harm immunocompromised individuals or cause detrimental birth defects, creating a growing need for efficient therapies. Currently approved anti-CMV drugs are beneficial, but resistance often arises during treatment—a common problem of most current medications, especially protein inhibitors. From a biological networks perspective (Alon, 2019Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits.Second edition. CRC Press, 2019Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), protein inhibitors target individual nodes, allowing easy escape by single point mutations, if the mutant target maintains its essential interactions (links) and function. Instead of targeting a node, the novel feedback-disruptor (FD) approach targets an essential negative feedback link (Chaturvedi et al., 2022Chaturvedi S. Pablo M. Wolf M. Rosas-Rivera D. Calia G. Kumar A.J. Vardi N. Du K. Glazier J. Ke R. et al.Disrupting autorepression circuitry generates “open-loop lethality” to yield escape-resistant antiviral agents.Cell. 2022; 185: 2086-2102.e22https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), practically eliminating the chance of CMV resistance by mutational repair. Indeed, multiple (∼18) mutations of both originally interacting nodes would be necessary to generate new binding interfaces and restore the disrupted link, the chance of which is the 18th power of the already-low chance of a single mutation. Indeed, FD cleared CMV from infected human cells without signs of resistance during long-term propagation in culture, whereas using the antivirals fomivirsen or acyclovir/ganciclovir elicited resistance. The link that FD targets is the autorepression of the immediate-early IE86 (IE2) transcription factor, which represses expression of two splice variants, IE72 (IE1) and IE86, from CMV’s major immediate-early promoter (MIEP), by binding as a hexamer to a 14-nucleotide cis repression sequence (crs) in MIEP (Figure 1). Both IE proteins are transcriptional activators essential for initiating a standard cascade of events (Hein and Weissman, 2022Hein M.Y. Weissman J.S. Functional single-cell genomics of human cytomegalovirus infection.Nat. Biotechnol. 2022; 40: 391-401https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01059-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) toward CMV reproduction, but high IE86 expression is toxic. Thus, although MIEP-activating natural signals accelerate IE protein accumulation, IE86 autorepression limits the level of IE expression to a presumed optimum below toxicity (Teng et al., 2012Teng M.W. Bolovan-Fritts C. Dar R.D. Womack A. Simpson M.L. Shenk T. Weinberger L.S. An endogenous accelerator for viral gene expression confers a fitness advantage.Cell. 2012; 151: 1569-1580https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). IE proteins can then activate downstream gene expression efficiently, causing host cells to first inflate and ultimately die only during the late events of assembly, egress, and budding. Importantly, both IE1 (Vardi et al., 2018Vardi N. Chaturvedi S. Weinberger L.S. Feedback-mediated signal conversion promotes viral fitness.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E8803-E8810https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802905115Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and IE2 activate various host and viral promoters, including MIEP, creating a network structure of nested positive and negative autoregulation. Overall, three properties create the opportunity for FD to work against CMV: negative feedback, positive feedback, and overexpression toxicity. The principle of FD therapy is to sequester IE86 away from the viral crs and disrupt negative feedback by competitive FD-IE86 binding, thus allowing positive feedback to drive IE86 up to fatally toxic levels (Figure 1). Infected cells then die prematurely, taking CMV with them. The authors tested these ideas with a 28-basepair-long, crs-containing, chemically stabilized FD identified by in vitro optimization. As expected, the FDs caused toxically high IE gene expression, followed by apoptotic and ferroptotic death of virus-carrying cells in multiple cell lines infected by multiple herpesviruses, without signs of antiviral resistance. Herpesvirus titers also dropped substantially in FD-treated mice, proving in vivo applicability, although latently infected cell populations might pose a roadblock to the cure. Surprisingly, FDs disrupting a negative feedback loop also reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers by selectively killing infected green monkey cells, supporting the generality of the FD approach. In another study, reducing IE86 mRNA and protein levels by RNA interference (Møller et al., 2018Møller R. Schwarz T.M. Noriega V.M. Panis M. Sachs D. Tortorella D. tenOever B.R. miRNA-mediated targeting of human cytomegalovirus reveals biological host and viral targets of IE2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: 1069-1074https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1719036115Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) caused dramatic IE1 overexpression and boosted viral fitness. These contrasting effects raise the question whether IE1 levels also increase upon FD treatment proportionally to IE86, most of which would be FD-bound, according to synthetic gene circuits with related topology (Nevozhay et al., 2009Nevozhay D. Adams R.M. Murphy K.F. Josić K. Balázsi G. Negative autoregulation linearizes the dose-response and suppresses the heterogeneity of gene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 5123-5128https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0809901106Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). If they do, then the key difference between RNA interference and FD (i.e., node and link targeting) will be the drop versus rise of total IE86 levels, respectively. This altogether suggests that FD-bound IE86 hexamers should still be toxic, possibly by activating gene expression, which will be interesting to test in future studies. Broader FD applicability may require establishing its minimal requirements, i.e., whether positive and/or negative feedback would be dispensable. In principle, FD might need to just remove a nontoxic repressor from some toxic gene’s promoter, which suggests that repression of a toxic gene’s expression (even without feedback) might be sufficient to target. However, the entangled autoactivator-autorepressor functions of IE86 prevent testing these ideas in herpesviruses. In CMV, positive feedback seems important to drive and maintain IE86 expression at toxically high levels upon negative feedback disruption, akin to cell differentiation. Autoregulation is also common in bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, which hold potential as targets of antibacterial FD if ways are found to activate the toxin (LeRoux et al., 2020LeRoux M. Culviner P.H. Liu Y.J. Littlehale M.L. Laub M.T. Stress can Induce transcription of toxin-antitoxin systems without activating toxin.Mol.

FD sets a highly promising example as a radically innovative therapy that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, such as protein inhibition. The potential of FD as an antimicrobial or as a cancer drug inert to resistance will be very interesting to examine in future studies.

All participants were followed-up at two- and four-weeks post-abortion to evaluate intervention effects on mental health, social support, and abortion-related stigma scores. A Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test was used to assess the effect of each intervention compared to the control group. In total, 371 women participated at baseline and were each randomized to the study arms.Using Kruskal-Wallis tests, the nurse arm improved mental health scores from baseline to week two; however this was only marginally significant (p = 0.059). The nurse arm also lowered stigma scores from baseline to week four, and this was marginally significant (p = 0.099). No other differences were found between the study arms. This person-centered mobile phone-based intervention may improve mental health and decrease perceived stigma among Kenyan women who received abortion services in private clinics.Nurses trained in person-centered abortion care, in particular, may improve women's experiences post-abortion and potentially reduce feelings of shame and stigma and improve mental health in this context."

According to the results, the discrete element simulation model was established and the value range of simulation test parameters was determined. Then, the actual repose angle of Chinese cabbage seeds was obtained by physical accumulation test using bottomless conical cylinder lifting method. Plackett-Burman test, steepest climb test, Box-Behnken test and parameter optimization test were carried out in sequence with the actual angle of repose as the response value. Finally, the obtained parameters are verified.1. The Plackett-Burman test showed that the seed-seed rolling friction coefficient, the seed-steel rolling friction coefficient, the seed-seed static friction coefficient, and the seed-steel static friction coefficient had significant effects on the repose angle of Chinese cabbage seeds (P<0.05). 2. The optimization test showed that the seed-seed rolling friction coefficient was 0.08, the seed-steel rolling friction coefficient was 0.109, the seed-seed static friction coefficient was 0.496, and the seed-steel static friction coefficient was 0.415. 3. The validation test showed that the repose angle of Chinese cabbage seeds under such parameter was 23.62°, and the error with the repose angle of the physical test was 0.73%.The study show that the discrete element simulation parameters of Chinese cabbage seeds model and calibration are reliable, which can provide reference for the discrete element simulation of Chinese cabbage seeds."
https://openalex.org/W4283585545,"Research funded by the National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research Programme is being undertaken in a complex system which brings opportunities and challenges for researchers to maximise the impact of their research. This study seeks to better understand the facilitators, challenges and barriers to research impact and knowledge mobilisation from the perspective of UK public health researchers. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, informed by the Payback Framework, with public health researchers who held a research award with the National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research programme up to March 2017 was conducted. Following a thematic analysis, three strongly interlinked themes were extracted from the data and three key factors were highlighted as important for facilitating knowledge mobilisation and impact in UK public health research: (1) Public health researcher’s perception of the purpose of the research (2) Approaches to undertaking Knowledge mobilisation activities (3) The complex nature of public health research in the wider research context. These have been reflected onto the Payback framework. Public health researchers can maximise the likelihood for impact by being aware of the context in which they are undertaking research, using different methods, and employing several strategies to take advantage of opportunities. There is a need to support researchers with knowledge mobilisation activities and for funders to identify their expectations of the impact resulting from research. Our findings have relevance to public health researchers and funders interested in increasing the benefit that research brings to society."
https://openalex.org/W4283587285,"The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to benefit the globalized world by safeguarding economic and environmental resources necessary for quality health and well-being and moderate growth and development. The study focused specifically on SDG-3 (good health and well-being), SDG-5 (gender equality), and SDG-8 (decent work and economic growth) to identify the most significant influencing factors that can affect the under-5 mortality rate in a large cross-section of 166 countries. The research used three different regression apparatuses to produce consistent and unbiased estimates: cross-sectional, robust least squares, and quantile regression approaches. Additionally, the innovation accounting matrix technique examines the intertemporal relationships between the variables over the time horizon. The data reveal that precarious female employment increases the under-5 mortality rate. On the other hand, women's political autonomy continued economic growth, and higher immunization coverage is supporting factors for achieving healthcare sustainability agenda. The ex-ante analysis indicates that per capita income will significantly impact the under-5 mortality rate, followed by women's political autonomy, insecure female employment, and immunization coverage during the next ten years. The results are consistent with other health indicators such as the health damage function, labour market function, and wealth function. The study suggests that the more unlocking women's potential in political life, the more likely it is to achieve equitable healthcare choices and reduce the mortality rate among children under five. As a result, there is an urgent need for women to have an equitable share of the labour market to appropriately meet their family healthcare demands."
