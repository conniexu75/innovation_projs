https://openalex.org/W2078739145,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is a well-known toxic gas, is found in relatively high concentrations in the brain. Although a neuromodulatory role of H2S has been demonstrated, little is known of its other biological functions. Here we show that H2S protects primary cultures of neurons from death in a well-studied model of oxidative stress caused by glutamate, a process called oxidative glutamate toxicity--or oxytosis. We found that H2S increases the glutathione levels, which normally decrease during the cell death cascade, by enhancing the activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and up-regulating cystine transport. Cystine (cysteine) is the rate-limiting substrate of glutathione synthesis. These observations reveal that H2S protects neurons from oxytosis by increasing the production of the antioxidant glutathione."

RNA silencing is initiated through Dicer-mediated processing of double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA guide strand associates with the Argonaute protein in silencing effector complexes, recognizes complementary sequences and targets them for silencing. The PAZ domain is an RNA-binding module found in Argonaute and some Dicer proteins and its structure has been determined in the free state. Here, we report the 2.6 A crystal structure of the PAZ domain from human Argonaute eIF2c1 bound to both ends of a 9-mer siRNA-like duplex. In a sequence-independent manner, PAZ anchors the 2-nucleotide 3' overhang of the siRNA-like duplex within a highly conserved binding pocket, and secures the duplex by binding the 7-nucleotide phosphodiester backbone of the overhang-containing strand and capping the 5'-terminal residue of the complementary strand. On the basis of the structure and on binding assays, we propose that PAZ might serve as an siRNA-end-binding module for siRNA transfer in the RNA silencing pathway, and as an anchoring site for the 3' end of guide RNA within silencing effector complexes."

We report here that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a prosurvival, antiapoptotic factor in pancreatic cancer cells. Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells generated ROS, which was stimulated by growth factors (serum, insulin-like growth factor I, or fibroblast growth factor-2). Growth factors also stimulated membrane NAD(P)H oxidase activity in these cells. Both intracellular ROS and NAD(P)H oxidase activity were inhibited by antioxidants tiron and N-acetylcysteine and the inhibitor of flavoprotein-dependent oxidases, diphenylene iodonium, but not by inhibitors of various other ROS-generating enzymes. Using Rho0 cells deficient in mitochondrial DNA, we showed that a nonmitochondrial NAD(P)H oxidase is a major source of growth factor-induced ROS in pancreatic cancer cells. Among proteins that have been implicated in NAD(P)H oxidase activity, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells do not express the phagocytic gp91phox subunit but express several nonphagocytic oxidase (NOX) isoforms. Transfection with Nox4 antisense oligonucleotide inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase activity and ROS production in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Inhibiting ROS with the antioxidants, Nox4 antisense, or MnSOD overexpression all stimulated apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells as measured by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, cytochrome c release, and effector caspase activation. The results show that growth factor-induced ROS produced by NAD(P)H oxidase (probably Nox4) protect pancreatic cancer cells from apoptosis. This mechanism may play an important role in pancreatic cancer resistance to treatment and thus represent a novel therapeutic target.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1Wanebo H.J. Vezeridis M.P. Cancer. 1996; 78: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). One mechanism mediating pancreatic cancer aggressiveness and unresponsiveness to treatment is its resistance to apoptosis. Constitutive activation of antiapoptotic proteins such as transcription factors NF-κB (2Aggarwal B.B. Biochem.

In this regard, we recently showed (13Mouria M. Gukovskaya A.S. Jung Y. Buechler P. Hines O.J. Reber H.A. Pandol S.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 98: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) that compounds with antioxidative properties, quercetin, resveratrol and genistein, stimulated apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. ROS are highly reactive O2 metabolites that include superoxide radical (O2−˙), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OH·) (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Large quantities of ROS are produced by phagocytes, mediating host defense against invading microorganisms (15Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). ROS generation was also detected in nonphagocytic cells (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li J.M. Shah A.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 285: R277-R297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Human tumor cells produce significant amounts of ROS, albeit smaller than in phagocytes (18Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar). Sources of cellular ROS include leakage from the mitochondrial electron transport chain as well as a number of ROS-generating plasma membrane and cytosolic enzymes (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In phagocytes, large amounts of ROS are produced during the oxidative burst by the plasma membrane NAD(P)H oxidase, a well characterized multicomponent enzyme with gp91phox and p22phox catalytic subunits that together form an integral complex called flavocytochrome b558 (15Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Recently, proteins of the nonphagocytic oxidase (NOX) family homologous to gp91phox have been shown to generate ROS in nonphagocytic, in particular cancer, cells (12Brar S.S. Corbin Z. Kennedy T.P. Hemendinger R. Thornton L. Bommarius B. Arnold R.S. Whorton A.R. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Krenitsky K. Ardie K.G. Lambeth J.D. Hoidal J.R. Am. J.

Furthermore, functional components of the phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase have been found to mediate superoxide production in some nonphagocytic cells (22Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 23Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Other ROS-generating enzymes are xanthine oxidase, nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and lipoxygenases (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that ROS play signaling roles in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, including proliferation (24Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), adhesion (25Chiarugi P. Pani G. Giannoni E. Taddei L. Colavitti R. Raugei G. Symons M. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Ramponi G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and hypertension (17Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R277-R297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Li J.M. Shah A.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: S221-S226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, growth factors are known to stimulate ROS in a variety of cell types through receptor-transducing pathways, although the detailed mechanism is poorly understood (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth factor-induced ROS production is believed to be necessary for optimal propagation of mitogenic signals (24Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Recent data have demonstrated an important role of ROS in neoplastic proliferation. Nox1 overexpression transforms normal fibroblasts and creates a cell line that is tumorigenic in athymic mice (27Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Nox4 was found to regulate growth of malignant melanoma cells (21Brar S.S. Kennedy T.P. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Whorton A.R. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1212-C1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); Nox5 was found to regulate growth of prostate cancer cells (12Brar S.S. Corbin Z. Kennedy T.P. Hemendinger R. Thornton L. Bommarius B. Arnold R.S. Whorton A.R. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Krenitsky K. Ardie K.G. Lambeth J.D. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C353-C369Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Compared with their roles in growth and proliferation, the effect of ROS on cell death is less well understood. Most data show that ROS stimulate cell death (6Simon H.U. Haj-Yehia A. Levi-Schaffer F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar, 7Kannan K. Jain S.K.

In particular, exogenous H2O2 causes apoptosis at low doses and necrosis at high doses (29Sakamoto T. Repasky W.T. Uchida K. Hirata A. Hirata F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest, however, that ROS inhibit apoptosis in smooth muscle (9Wedgwood S. Black S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L305-L312PubMed Google Scholar), leukemia cells (10Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), colorectal (11Lin K.I. Pasinelli P. Brown R.H. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13650-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and prostate cancer cells (12Brar S.S. Corbin Z. Kennedy T.P. Hemendinger R. Thornton L. Bommarius B. Arnold R.S. Whorton A.R. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Krenitsky K. Ardie K.G. Lambeth J.D. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C353-C369Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The prosurvival effect of ROS can be mediated through antiapoptotic redox-sensitive pathways known to be activated by ROS (e.g. NF-κB and heat shock proteins) (30Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 551-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Garrido C. Gurbuxani S. Ravagnan L. Kroemer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Little is known about the sources and the roles of ROS in pancreatic cancer cells. Inhibition of lipoxygenase (a putative source of ROS) as well as overexpression of an antioxidant enzyme, MnSOD, attenuated the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells (32Tong W.G. Ding X.Z. Witt R.C. Adrian T.E. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 929-935PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cullen J.J. Weydert C. Hinkhouse M.M. Ritchie J. Domann F.E. Spitz D. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1297-1303PubMed Google Scholar). The present study sought to determine the sources of ROS generation, their stimulation by growth factors, and whether ROS affect apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. We found that growth factors stimulate ROS generation by activating membrane nonmitochondrial NAD(P)H oxidase (probably Nox4) and that inhibiting ROS by different approaches stimulates apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. The prosurvival effect of ROS may be an important mechanism of pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy. Reagents—2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR); Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC was from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan); benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH2F was from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). The Nox4 antibody generated from a His-tagged recombinant fragment of human Nox4 (encoding the C-terminal amino acids 494–513) was a gift from Dr. Barry J. Goldstein (Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Anti-cytochrome c antibody was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA); anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV antibody was from Molecular Probes; anti-MnSOD antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, the poorly differentiated MIA PaCa-2 and moderately differentiated PANC-1, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimicotic solution (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were used between passages 4 and 12. For analyses, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105/ml in 100-mm culture dishes in the presence and absence of 15% FBS, 100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and 50 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) or the indicated inhibitors and cultured for up to 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. Generation of Rho0 Cells—MIA PaCa-2 Rho0 cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were generated by incubating wild type cells (Rho+) for 6–8 weeks with 100 ng/ml ethidium bromide. The medium was supplemented with 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 50 μg/ml uridine, and 100 μg/ml pyruvate to compensate for the respiratory metabolism deficit as previously described (34King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 35King M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 339-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After selection, the MIA PaCa-2 Rho0 cells were cultured in the above specified medium without ethidium bromide. To verify the mtDNA depletion, total cellular DNA was extracted and subjected to PCR using two pairs of human mtDNA specific primers: 1) Mts1 (forward) (5′-cctagggataacagcgcaat) and Mtas1 (reverse) (5′-tagaagagcgatggtgagag), which gave a 630-bp product, and 2) Mts2 (forward) (5′-aacatacccatggccaacct) and Mtas2 (reverse) (5′-ggcaggagtaatcagaggtg), which gave a 532-bp product (36Hail Jr., N. Youssef E.M. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6698-6702PubMed Google Scholar, 37Park K.S. Nam K.J. Kim J.W. Lee Y.B. Han C.Y. Jeong J.K. Lee H.K. Pak Y.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E1007-E1014PubMed Google Scholar). For control, we measured the expression of β-actin, which is coded by chromosomal DNA. Measurement of Intracellular ROS Levels—Intracellular ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry in cells loaded with the redox-sensitive dye DCFH-DA (38Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The nonfluorescent DCFH-DA readily diffuses into the cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the polar derivative DCFH, which is oxidized in the presence of H2O2 to the highly fluorescent DCF. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were incubated in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm DCFH-DA, harvested, and resuspended in the medium without DCFH-DA. Fluorescence was recorded on FL-1 channel of FACScan® (Becton Dickinson). Measurement of NAD(P)H Oxidase Activity—Superoxide production was measured in total cell homogenates or in membrane and cytosolic fractions by using lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence as described in Refs. 39Rajagopalan S. Kurz S. Munzel T. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1916-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar and 40Sorescu D. Somers M.J. Lassegue B. Grant S. Harrison D.G. Griendling K.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar. Briefly, 50 μg of protein was diluted in 500 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EGTA and 150 mm sucrose. Dark-adapted lucigenin was added to the sample, and chemiluminescence measurement was immediately started. Chemiluminescence (in arbitrary units) was measured at 15-s intervals for 1 min in a Turner 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). NADPH or NADH (100 μm each) were used as substrates. The specificity of the measurement was confirmed by adding either a nonenzymatic superoxide scavenger, tiron (10 mm), or superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml; Sigma). In some experiments, the homogenate was preincubated for 30 min with various inhibitors of ROS-generating enzymes as described in the legend of Fig. 3. In this and other assays, protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). It has been shown (41Li Y. Zhu H. Kuppusamy P. Roubaud V. Zweier J.L. Trush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2015-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 42Janiszewski M. Souza H.P. Liu X. Pedro M.A. Zweier J.L. Laurindo F.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that at high doses lucigenin can by itself stimulate additional superoxide production, which is especially pronounced with NADH as a substrate. This may result in overestimation of NAD(P)H oxidase activity in the homogenate. To exclude the artificial effect of lucigenin, we performed the following experiments. Chemiluminescence was measured in cell homogenates at 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm lucigenin in the presence and absence of NADPH or NADH. At lucigenin concentrations 5–50 μm, the results showed much higher chemiluminescence with NADPH than with NADH. With 100–200 μm lucigenin, NADH-induced signals became larger than those induced by NADPH. The responses obtained with 5–50 μm but not with 100–200 μm lucigenin were blocked by DPI, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H-dependent oxidases. In accord with the data presented in Ref. 42Janiszewski M. Souza H.P. Liu X. Pedro M.A. Zweier J.L. Laurindo F.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, these results show that 5–50 μm lucigenin does not induce an artificial O2−˙ production in pancreatic cancer cells. The kinetics of the chemiluminescence response was the same with lucigenin concentrations 5–50 μm; however, the magnitude of the signal was greater at 25 and 50 μm. Thus, the data presented were obtained with 25 or 50 μm lucigenin. Preparation of Total Cell Lysates—Cells were incubated in a lysis buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 Tris, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C until assayed. Cell Fractionation—Cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Na-EGTA, 1 mm Na-EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0), allowed to swell for 30 min at 4 °C, and then disrupted by 80 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g to pellet nuclei and cell debris. Supernatants were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min, and the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) was collected. The pellet (heavy membranes enriched with mitochondria) was lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.2) for 1 h. To validate the quality of cytosolic and mitochondrial separation, both fractions were assessed by immunoblotting for the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV. Reverse Transcription-PCR—The procedures were as we described previously (43Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J.

Briefly, total RNA was obtained from pancreatic cancer cells with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript II preamplification kit (Invitrogen). cDNA derived from 0.5 μg of total RNA was subjected to PCR with human gene-specific, intron-spanning primers that are described in Table I. Target sequences were amplified at 56–58 °C. The reverse transcription-PCR products were all of the expected size (see Fig. 5).Table IPrimer sequences for human NAD(P)H subunitsmRNAForward primerReverse primerExpected sizeGenBank™ accession no.bpNox15′-acaaattccagtgtgcagaccac5′-agactggaatatcggtgacagca247AJ438989gp91phox (Nox2)5′-gggctgttcaatgcttgtggct5′-acatctttctcctcatcatggtgc413NM_000397Nox 35′-atgaacacctctggggtcagctga5′-ggatcggagtcactcccttcgctg458NM_015718Nox 45′-ctcagcggaatcaatcagctgtg5′-agaggaacacgacaatcagccttag286NM_016931Nox 55′-atcaagcggccccctttttttcac5′-ctcattgtcacactcctcgacagc630AF317889p22phox5′-gtgtttgtgtgcctgctggagt5′-ctgggcggctgcttgatggt320M21186p47phox5′-gtacccagccagcactatgtgt5′-aaagtagcctgtgacgtcgtct771NM_000265p67phox5′-ttcgagggaaccagctgataga5′-gcatgggaacactgagcttcac760M32011β-Actin5′-atgggtcagaaggattcctatgt5′-gaaggtctcaaacatgatctggg243NM_001101 Open table in a new tab Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—Changes in Δψm were detected with the potential-sensitive probe MitoTracker Red (CMX-Ros; Molecular Probes), as we described previously (45Vaquero E.C.

During the last 30 min of the incubation period, cells were loaded with 10 nm CMX-Ros for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed on the FACScan® using FL-3 detector. To completely dissipate Δψm, cells were treated with the uncoupling agent fluorocyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (FCCP; 50 μm) for 1 h before CMX-Ros staining. Transfections—Transient transfection with human MnSOD was performed using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3-MnSOD plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Larry W. Oberley (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Transfection was done according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 5–8 μg of the plasmid DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE for a 60-mm dish. Transfection efficiency was assessed by co-transfection of a green fluorescent protein plasmid. At 48 or 72 h post-transfection, cell lysates were collected, and the expression of the MnSOD protein was measured by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-MnSOD antibody from Upstate Biotechnology. Transfection of MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells with Nox4 antisense oligonucleotide was done as described in Ref. 12Brar S.S. Corbin Z. Kennedy T.P. Hemendinger R. Thornton L. Bommarius B. Arnold R.S.

The Nox4 scrambled oligonucleotide, 5′-TCGAGGAGGTCCTGTGTCGG, was used as a control. 6 h post-transfection, fresh medium was supplied, and cells were cultured for an additional 48 or 72 h before the specified analyses. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins from cell lysates were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (4 mm Tris base, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) and incubated for 2 h with the indicated primary antibodies and then for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed with the Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Measurements of Apoptosis—Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was measured by using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance values were normalized to cell number. Phosphatidylserine externalization was analyzed with the annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit from Roche Applied Science as we described before (45Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Nam K.J. Gukovsky I. Pandol S.J.

Cells were collected and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 500 μl of binding buffer containing 2 μl of annexin-V and 1 μlof propidium iodide, incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Effector caspase (DEVDase) activity was measured by a fluorogenic assay in whole cell lysates using Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC as a substrate, as we described before (45Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Nam K.J. Gukovsky I. Pandol S.J. Gukovskaya A.S. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1188-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The lysate (50–100 μg of protein) was incubated with 10 μm substrate in a reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. Caspase substrate cleavage releases AMC, which emits fluorescent signal with 380-nm excitation and 440-nm emission. Fluorescence was measured in a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorimeter and calibrated using a standard curve for AMC. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol was assayed by Western blot analysis of cytosolic fractions, as we described previously (45Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Nam K.J. Gukovsky I. Pandol S.J.

Various functions have been attributed to the dimerization between different receptor subtypes. For instance, heterodimerization has been proposed to promote the formation of receptors with unique pharmacological properties, contributing to the pharmacological diversity of GPCRs (3Jordan B.A. Devi L.A.

For the metabotropic GABAb receptor, heterodimerization between GABAb-R1 and GABAb-R2 is an obligatory step for cell surface expression of a functional receptor (10White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 11Ng G.Y. Clark J. Coulombe N. Ethier N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7607-7610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This was shown to result from the masking of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal found in the C terminus of GABAb-R1, presumably through the formation of a coiled-coil domain between the C termini of the two receptor subtypes (12Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The obligatory nature of this heterodimerization for cell surface trafficking and signaling was considered for a long time as a particularity of the GABAb receptor, which belongs to a GPCR subfamily (family 3) containing only a few members (13Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). However, a recent study indicated that the heterodimerization between two closely related members of family 1 GPCRs, the adrenergic α1D and α1B receptors, may be a prerequisite for the proper cell surface expression of the α1D subtype in both experimental models and real tissues (14Hague C. Uberti M.A. Chen Z. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15541-15549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). So far, despite the numerous examples of receptor homodimerization reported in the literature (15Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 16Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), the biological function of this phenomenon has remained elusive, probably because it is extremely difficult to experimentally differentiate the dimer properties of identical receptor subtypes from those of monomers. However, a growing number of observations indicates that GPCR homodimerization is constitutive and that it occurs in the ER, suggesting that it might play a role in the quality control and ER export of receptors (17Ayoub M.A. Couturier C.

The formation of either homodimers or heterodimers could thus represent a common prerequisite for GPCRs to be exported to the plasma membrane (PM). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that several other membrane proteins have been shown to require oligomerization for their proper maturation and cell surface targeting (20Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Bass J. Chiu G. Argon Y. Steiner D.F. J.

In this study, we sought to determine if homodimerization could indeed play a role in GPCR biogenesis and trafficking. Because β2AR homodimerization has been well characterized and tools have recently been developed to quantitatively investigate its dimerization in living cells (23Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P.

To examine the potential role of β2AR dimerization in receptor trafficking, mutants targeting a putative dimerization interface (23Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) as well as mutants that are retained within intracellular compartments were used. Here, we report that inhibiting dimerization leads to ER retention of the β2AR. In addition, we show that mutants that are not targeted to the PM act as dominant negative mutants for cell surface expression of the wild-type (WT) receptor through dimerization. Taken with the observation that β2AR dimerization could occur as early as the ER, our data provide direct evidence linking GPCR dimerization to their export to the plasma membrane. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells were maintained under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Transfections were performed using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (26Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and used 48 h post-transfection. DNA Constructs and Plasmids—The pcDNA3-HA-β2AR-Rluc and pcDNA3-myc-β2AR-Rluc were generated by subcloning the coding sequence of Renilla luciferase (Rluc) from pRL-CMV-β2AR-Rluc (24Angers S.

Receptor constructs harboring different mutations in the putative dimerization motif Gly276-X3-Gly280-X3-Leu284-X3 (GGL) present in the 6th transmembrane (TM) domain of the β2AR (β2AR-Leu276, β2AR-Leu280, β2AR-Tyr284, β2AR-Gly284, β2AR-Leu276-Leu280, β2AR-Leu280-Tyr284, and β2AR-Leu276-Leu280-Tyr284) were obtained by PCR-based mutagenesis using pcDNA3-HA-β2AR-Rluc as template. To generate the GGL mutant receptor-GFP fusion plasmids, a DNA fragment containing the mutation(s) (amino acids 200-344) was subcloned in pcDNA3-His-β2AR-GFP (26Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3-myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-Rluc was generated by PCR based substitution of the Phe332 and Phe336 by alanine residues using pcDNA3-myc-β2AR-Rluc as template. The pcDNA3-myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-GFP was then generated by subcloning the DNA fragment containing the F332A and F336A mutation (amino acids 200-344) into pcDNA3-myc-β2AR-GFP. The His-β2AR-Rluc and His-β2AR-GFP plasmids were described in Mercier et al. (25Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), whereas myc-GABAb-R1-Rluc, myc-GABAb-R1-GFP, and HA-GABAb-R2-GFP were reported in Perroy et al. (28Perroy J. Adam L. Qanbar R. Chenier S. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3816-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To replace the region encoding the C-terminal tail of the β2AR with that of the GABAb-R1b, a truncated coding region of the myc-β2AR (including the arginine residue at position 344) was amplified and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector to generate pcDNA3.1-myc-β2AR-trunc. The C-terminal tail of the GABAb-R1b (starting at position Leu860) fused to Rluc was amplified from the pcDNA3.1-GABAb-R1b-Rluc plasmid (19Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and subcloned in-frame into the pcDNA3.1-myc-β2AR-trunc to generate the pcDNA3-myc-β2AR-GBR1CT-Rluc chimera. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera proteins were all made using the variant GFP2 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all PCR-amplified stretches of DNA were verified by automated sequencing. Plasmids and sequences are available upon request. Luciferase Activity—Luminescence generated by the Rluc constructs was determined using a LumiCount™ (Packard) following the addition of 5 μm of the luciferase substrate coelanterazine H (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence Measurement—The total fluorescence was measured using a Packard FluoroCount™ with an excitation and emission filters set at 400 nm and 510 nm, respectively. BRET Assay—The BRET assay used to detect GPCR dimerization was described previously (24Angers S. Salahpour A. joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/glucose 0.1% or fractionated cell lysates were distributed in 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from Packard Bioscience). The luciferase substrate, DeepBlueC™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were performed using a TopCount NXT™ (Packard Bioscience), which allows the sequential integration of signals detected at 370-450 nm (luciferase) and 500-530 nm (GFP). BRET signals were calculated as the ratio of the light emitted at 500-530 nm by BRET acceptors (receptors fused to GFP), over the light emitted at 370-450 nm by BRET donors (receptors fused to Rluc). In each experiment, BRET values were corrected by subtracting the background ratios obtained upon expression of the BRET donor constructs alone. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were lysed in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine) using a Dounce homogenizer. Cellular debris and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Sucrose was then added to the supernatants to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 m, and lysates were layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose step gradient (0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.35, 1.5, and 2.0 m). Samples were centrifuged for 16 h at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor. Thirty-one fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top of the tubes. BRET was measured on 100-μl aliquots of each fraction. Rluc activity was also measured in each fraction to monitor cellular distribution of Rluc-fused receptors. Samples containing PM and ER were identified by immunoblotting using anti-Na/K-ATPase (A-276, Sigma) and anti-calnexin (SPA-860, Biotechnologies) antibodies, respectively. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell surface receptors were labeled with polyclonal anti-myc (A14, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and/or a monoclonal rat anti-HA (3F10, 1:100, Roche Applied Science) antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa-596 and anti-rat Oregon green, Molecular Probes). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin. Samples were processed for epifluorescence microscopy on a Nikon inverted microscope Eclipse TE2000-U using a ×100 planapochromat immersion CFi60 objective and a Roper CoolSnap HQ™ 16 bits charge-coupled device camera for acquisitions. The overlay were generated with the Metamorph™ software. Co-localization experiments were carried out with a Leica confocal TCS-SP2 microscope using a PL APO ×63 1.4 immersion objective. The TGN46 polyclonal antibody (trans-Golgi marker) was from Serotec, and the polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (C-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Quantitative Measurement of Cell Surface Receptors—Cell surface expression of HA-GPCR-Rluc constructs was determined by ELISA using the monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Total receptor level was assessed in the same sample by measuring the Rluc activity. The relative efficiency of cell surface targeting was deduced from the slope of the correlation between total receptor expression (Rluc) and the corresponding cell surface signal (ELISA) obtained for various expression levels. Subcellular Distribution of β2AR Dimers—Recent studies, based on co-immunoprecipitation and resonance energy transfer approaches, have revealed that many GPCRs form homodimers independently of receptor activation (15Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the site of formation of the dimers and thus their potential role in receptor biology, the subcellular distribution of β2AR dimers, detected by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), was studied after cell fractionation. For this purpose, His-β2AR-Rluc was expressed alone or in combination with His-β2AR-GFP, and PM was resolved from ER by ultra-centrifugation on a sucrose gradient (18Issafras H. Angers S. Bulenger S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Labbe-Jullie C. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 227: 34666-34673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Na/K-ATPase and calnexin were used as markers for PM (fractions 7-15) and ER (fractions 19-27), respectively (data not shown). Furthermore, the ER-retained myc-GABAb-R1-Rluc (12Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) was used as a specific marker of GPCR distribution in the ER fractions (Fig. 1). His-β2AR-Rluc was mostly associated with the PM (fractions 9-13) but a small proportion also co-sedimented with the ER (fractions 19-25). A significant BRET between His-β2AR-Rluc and His-β2AR-GFP was observed in both PM and ER fractions, indicating that dimers exist in both compartments. Because BRET is a ratiometric value, the comparable BRET observed in ER and PM indicates that the proportion of His-β2AR-Rluc interacting with His-β2AR-GFP is similar in the two compartments. Receptor dimerization was also found to be specific and not a mere results of receptor overexpression, because no BRET was detected in any fraction when His-β2AR-Rluc was co-expressed with the PM-exported isoform of the GABAb receptor (12Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) fused to GFP (HA-GABAb-R2-GFP). Our observations therefore suggest that specific β2AR dimerization can occur as early as the ER. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that, as a result of overexpression, the high ER concentration of receptors could favor specific dimerization in this compartment rather than later in the maturation pathway. Mutants of β2AR, Which Are Retained Within Intracellular Compartments, Have a Dominant Negative Effect on WT β2AR Targeting to the Cell Surface—The potential biological role of early receptor dimerization was further investigated by studying the effect of two receptor mutants, expected to be retained inside the cell, on WT β2AR trafficking. The first mutant (myc-β2AR-GBR1CT-Rluc) was generated by replacing the carboxyl tail of the β2AR with that of the GABAb-R1 that contains a well characterized arginine-based ER retention signal (12Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In the second mutant, the 332FXXXFXXXL340 motif, previously reported as a binding site for DRIP-78, a protein involved in the ER export of the D1-dopamine receptor (29Bermak J.C. Li M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was mutated to 332AXXXAXXXL340 (myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-Rluc). As predicted, both constructs were completely retained inside the cells (Fig. 2A, panels c-f) as shown by the lack of membrane receptor staining in non-permeabilized cells. This contrasts with the predominant PM expression of the WT β2AR (Fig. 2A, panel a). The subcellular distribution of the mutant receptors was further documented in confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments using anti-TGN46 and anti-calnexin antibodies to label the Golgi apparatus and the ER, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the myc-β2AR-GBR1CT-Rluc was found to co-localize strongly with the ER marker and only marginally with the Golgi marker, a labeling pattern that is identical to that of the WT myc-GABAb-R1-Rluc and most likely reflects the ER retention of the constructs. In contrast, myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-Rluc was found to co-localize with both calnexin and TGN46, indicating that the block in PM trafficking most likely occurred at the level of the trans-Golgi network for this mutant.Fig. 3Subcellular localization of export-deficient β2AR mutants. Confocal immunofluorescence experiments were performed on permeabilized HEK293T cells expressing myc-GABAb-R1-Rluc, myc-β2AR-GBR1CT-Rluc, or myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-Rluc. Receptors (green), trans-Golgi and ER (red) were immunostained with anti-myc (myc), anti-TGN46 (TGN46), and anti-calnexin (CAL) antibodies, respectively. Preparations were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Colocalization appears in yellow in overlays (OVER).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When co-expressed with either myc-β2AR-GBR1CT-Rluc or myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-Rluc, the WT HA-β2AR was retained inside the cells and co-localized with these receptor mutants (Fig. 2B, panels a-f). The dominant negative effect of mutant receptors on WT receptor export to the PM was specific to constructs bearing the β2AR sequence, because cell surface expression of the WT β2AR was not affected by the co-expression of the ER-retained myc-GABAb-R1-Rluc (Fig. 2B, panels g-i). To determine more quantitatively the effect of dominant negative mutants on WT receptor cell surface expression, a PM receptor targeting assay was designed. For this purpose, a β2AR bearing an HA epitope at the N terminus and Rluc at the C terminus was used. In each experiment, total WT receptor expression was monitored by measuring the luciferase activity with a cell permeable substrate (coelenterazine h) that can access receptor constructs both at the PM and in intracellular compartments. HA immunoreactivity of surface targeted receptors was measured, in parallel, by ELISA on non-permeabilized cells. The relative cell surface expression of the WT β2AR, determined as the ELISA/luminescence ratio, was assessed in the presence or absence of one of the retained mutants. As shown in Fig. 4A, co-expression of myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-GFP led to a 60% reduction of WT HA-β2AR-Rluc cell surface expression, an effect likely resulting from a dimerization between the WT HA-β2AR-Rluc and the intracellularly retained myc-β2AR-Ala332-Ala336-GFP, as indicated by the robust BRET signal measured between these two proteins (Fig. 4B). The impaired transport of the β2AR to the PM did not result from a nonspecific effect that could be attributed to any intracellularly retained receptors. Indeed, the ER-retained myc-GABAb-R1-GFP construct that cannot dimerize with the HA-β2AR-Rluc, as shown by the lack of BRET between the two constructs (Fig. 4B), had no effect on β2AR cell surface targeting (Fig. 4A). β2AR Dimerization-deficient Mutants Are Retained in the ER—The data described above are consistent with a model whereby dimerization is a process involved in the normal receptor trafficking to the PM. Accordingly, inhibiting dimerization should impact on this process. To directly test this hypothesis, a previously predicted putative dimerization motif present in the 6th TM domain of the β2AR, Gly276-X3-Gly280-X3-Leu284-X3 (GGL) (23Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of the three amino acids within this motif was mutated individually or in combination, and receptors tagged with Rluc or GFP were generated for each mutant. The effect of the mutations on receptor dimerization was then assessed by quantitative BRET. Mutation of glycine residues at positions 276 (β2AR-Leu276), 280 (β2AR-Leu280), or 276 and 280 (β2AR-Leu276-Leu280) did not significantly affect receptor dimerization (Fig. 5A). In contrast, all constructs harboring a mutation at position L284 (β2AR-Tyr284, β2AR-Gly284, β2AR-Leu280-Tyr284, and β2AR-Leu276-Leu280-Tyr284) showed a reduction of ∼40-50% in BRET, indicating impaired dimerization. BRET titration curves (25Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) were then performed at a constant level of BRET donor and increasing concentrations of BRET acceptor. As shown in Fig. 5B, the titration curve of the β2AR-Leu280-Leu280-Tyr284 mutant was significantly right-shifted when compared with that of the WT receptor, indicating a decreased propensity of receptor mutants to self assemble as compared with WT β2AR. Next, the efficiency of WT and dimerization-deficient mutant receptors to reach the cell surface was compared, using the PM receptor targeting assay described above. For each receptor, cell surface expression was determined as a function of total receptor expression. As shown in Fig. 6A, the slope of the correlation plot between total and cell surface receptors for the HA-β2AR-Leu276-Leu280-Tyr284-Rluc and HA-β2AR-Tyr284-Rluc was significantly lower than that observed for the WT or the HA-β2AR-Leu276-Leu280-Rluc mutant. Similar blunted slopes, reflecting altered cell surface targeting, were also observed for the other receptors mutated at position L284 (HA-β2AR-Gly284-Rluc, and HA-β2AR-Leu280-Tyr284-Rluc) but not for the HA-β2AR-Leu276-Rluc and HA-β2AR-Leu280-Rluc mutants (data not shown). By measuring the ratio between the slope values calculated for the mutants and those determined for the WT receptor, cell surface targeting of HA-β2AR-Leu276-Leu280-Tyr284-Rluc and HA-β2AR-Tyr284-Rluc mutants was estimated to be impaired by >50% as compared with WT (Fig. 6B). Consistent with its lack of effect on dimerization measured by BRET, substitution of Gly276 and Gly280 to leucine residues did not affect cell surface targeting of the HA-β2AR-Leu276-Leu280-Rluc. These data are consistent with dimerization being necessary for normal receptor trafficking to the PM. Subcellular fractionation experiments, comparing the relative distribution pattern of WT and dimerization-deficient mutants, revealed that the reduction of receptor expression in PM-enriched fractions was correlated with an increased association with ER enriched fractions (Fig. 6C), indicative of a block in the biosynthetic pathway. To further confirm the intracellular compartments in which the dimerization-deficient mutants were retained, confocal microscopy experiments were carried out using the HA-β2AR-Leu276-Leu280-Tyr284-Rluc triple mutant. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the intracellularly retained receptor showed a high degree of co-localization with calnexin and no detectable Golgi labeling, consistent with the notion that the export block occurs in the ER."

In this study, we analyzed interactions between the inner and outer membrane components of the tri-partite multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC from Escherichia coli. We found that, once assembled, the intermembrane AcrAB-TolC complex is stable during the separation of the inner and outer membranes and subsequent purification. All three components of the complex co-purify when the affinity tag is attached to either of the proteins suggesting bi-partite interactions between AcrA, AcrB, and TolC. We show that antibiotics, the substrates of AcrAB-TolC, stabilize interactions within the complex. However, the formation of the AcrAB-TolC complex does not require an input of energy.

A distinctive feature of Gram-negative bacteria is the presence of the inner (IM) 1The abbreviations used are: IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; His6 tag, six-histidine tag; MICs, minimal inhibitory concentrations; DSP, dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate; CCCP, cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; PUR, puromycin; OLE, oleandomycin; PRO, proflavine; MC-207,110, Phe-Arg β-naphthylamide; WT, wild type; HMW, high molecular weight complexes; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; CyoA, cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit II. 1The abbreviations used are: IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; His6 tag, six-histidine tag; MICs, minimal inhibitory concentrations; DSP, dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate; CCCP, cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; PUR, puromycin; OLE, oleandomycin; PRO, proflavine; MC-207,110, Phe-Arg β-naphthylamide; WT, wild type; HMW, high molecular weight complexes; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; CyoA, cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit II. and outer (OM) membranes. The two membranes are separated by an aqueous compartment called the periplasm, which provides a microenvironment of small molecules that buffer the cell from changes in its local surrounding. In fulfilling this essential role, the periplasm is not static but a dynamic cell compartment that changes in response to external and internal stimuli (1Koch A.L. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 24: 23-59Google Scholar).The dynamic structure of a periplasm creates a special problem for the transport of diverse molecules into and out of a bacterial cell. To avoid the diluting effect of the periplasm, all molecules destined to move into an external medium or into the cytoplasm must pass the two membranes in a coordinated manner. Yet the dynamic structure of the periplasm should not be compromised. An ultimate solution to the coordination of processes spatially separated into two different membranes is the existence of intermembrane multiprotein complexes that span both membranes and create a bridge across the periplasm. In this case, the transport is achieved without a periplasmic intermediate. Numerous transporters of Gram-negative bacteria involved in the extracellular secretion of protein and the efflux of toxic molecules were shown to operate by forming intermembrane complexes (reviewed in Refs. 2Andersen C. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 412-416Google Scholar and 3Zgurskaya H.I. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 292: 95-105Google Scholar). In the latter case this feature is particularly important, because accumulation of periplasmic intermediates could lead to cell death. Although highly efficient in transport, the intermembrane complexes create tight links between the inner and outer membranes and, thus, could impede the plasticity of the periplasm. How such complexes operate without compromising the dynamic nature of the periplasm remains unclear.One possibility is that the intermembrane complexes are also dynamic structures and assemble only in the presence of specific substrates. Such a mechanism was proposed for the export of α-hemolysin by HlyBD-TolC complex from Escherichia coli. Here, the inner membrane complex HlyBD was shown to be transiently recruited by the outer membrane channel TolC to form an intermembrane channel (4Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Google Scholar). The interactions between the IM and OM components were stabilized by the substrate, because the complex disintegrated after translocation. Consistent with the dynamic interactions within the complex is the finding that at least one component of the HlyBD-TolC transporter, the OM channel TolC, is shared by several other transport systems to achieve both an uptake and an efflux of diverse molecules (5Buchanan S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 3-6Google Scholar).The major multidrug efflux pump AcrAB from E. coli cooperates with TolC to extrude out of the cell an extremely broad range of antimicrobial compounds, including antibiotics, detergents, dyes, and organic solvents (6Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Google Scholar). Located in the inner membrane, the drug:proton antiporter AcrB captures its substrates within the phospholipid bilayer (7Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Google Scholar) and transports them into the external medium via the OM channel TolC (8Fralick J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5803-5805Google Scholar). The cooperation between AcrB and TolC is presumably mediated by the periplasmic protein AcrA. All three components are required for efficient transport, because disruption of any of the three genes results in hypersusceptibility of E. coli to various substrates (9Okusu H. Ma D. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 306-308Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of this transporter is that the drug efflux proceeds directly into the external medium, bypassing the periplasm, suggesting the existence of an intermembrane complex. In this study, we investigate the architecture and assembly of the intermembrane AcrAB-TolC complex.Previous hydrodynamic studies suggested that the purified AcrA protein is a highly asymmetric molecule with a length of up to 200 Å (10Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Google Scholar). Consistent with the hydrodynamic estimate, electron microscopy crystallography showed that AcrA molecules form a coiled structure with the length of 210 Å (11Avila-Sakar A.J. Misaghi S. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Downing K.H. Zgurskaya H. Nikaido H. Nogales E. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 81-88Google Scholar). This length of AcrA is sufficient to span the periplasm and provide a connection between the IM and OM of E. coli. The N-terminal lipid moiety anchors this protein into the periplasmic leaflet of the IM. The interaction with the IM is further strengthened by specific binding to the AcrB transporter (12Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4264-4267Google Scholar). Cross-linked invivo AcrA is an oligomer possibly a trimer. Although AcrB is not required for the AcrA oligomerization, only oligomeric AcrA cross-links to AcrB. Using the same approach, no cross-linked complexes containing TolC were identified (12Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4264-4267Google Scholar).Purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes AcrB was shown to cooperate with AcrA to transport fluorescently labeled phospholipids (7Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Google Scholar). This transport activity of AcrAB was dependent on proton-motive force. Three charged amino acid residues Asp-407, Asp-408, and Lys-940 located in the transmembrane segments 4 and 10 were proposed to form a proton translocating pathway in AcrB and its close homologs (13Guan L. Nakae T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1734-1739Google Scholar, 14Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). Mutations in these amino acid residues result in a complete inactivation of the transporter. In crystals, AcrB is a trimer (14Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar, 15Yu E.W. McDermott G. Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Google Scholar) in concert with the trimeric arrangements of AcrA (12Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4264-4267Google Scholar) and the OM component of this complex TolC (16Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Google Scholar). The structural signature of AcrB is a large periplasmic domain, which was shown to play a central role in drug recognition and transport (17Tikhonova E.B. Wang Q. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6499-6507Google Scholar, 18Elkins C.A. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6490-6498Google Scholar). The top of this trimeric periplasmic domain forms a funnel, and the edge of the funnel has the dimensions that would fit with the tip of the periplasmic helical barrel of TolC (16Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Google Scholar). This periplasmic barrel of TolC is about 70 Å long and could reach half the way across the periplasm. This observation prompted a model that AcrB could reach across the periplasm to bind to TolC (14Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The affinity His6 tag was introduced by the PCR. All primer sequences are available upon request. The pUC151A plasmid was used as a template to construct pAHisB and pABHis, and the pTrc99A-TolC plasmid was used as a template for construction of pTolCHis. Native AcrB contains two C-terminal histidine residues. To construct the pAcrABHis plasmid, a 1331-bp PCR fragment of the acrB gene with four additional histidine residues was digested with HpaI and NsiI restriction enzymes and inserted into the pUC151A plasmid, treated with the same enzymes. The pAHisB plasmid was constructed by the replacement of an MscI-XbaI fragment of pUC151A with a PCR-amplified acrA containing the His6 tag. The resultant plasmid was then treated with XbaI and SphI restriction enzymes and ligated with the PCR-amplified acrB gene to produce pAHisB. The pTolCHis plasmid was constructed by the replacement of a BlpI-HindIII fragment of pTrc99A-TolC with the PCR-amplified tolC fragment encoding 63 C-terminal amino acid residues of TolC fused with His6 tag. To construct plasmid pAB408His a single D408A substitution was introduced into the acrB gene using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pABHis as a template. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrain/plasmidDescriptionSource/referenceZK4Wild type MC410036Gilson L. Mahanty H.K. Kolter R.

Antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (35 μg/ml), spectinomycin (50 μg/ml), tetracycline (25 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) were used for the selection where indicated. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various antimicrobial agents were determined as described previously (17Tikhonova E.B. Wang Q. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6499-6507Google Scholar).Protein Purification—Native AcrB was purified from E. coli ECM2112 containing pUC151A plasmid as described previously (7Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Google Scholar). Unlipidated AcrAHis was purified from E. coli strain AG100AX containing pUZ10 plasmid as described (10Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Google Scholar).For purification of native TolC without the His6 tag, the E. coli strain AG100AX containing pTrc99A-TolC plasmid was grown in 1 liter of LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to A600 ∼ 0.6, then the expression of TolC was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Preparation of membrane fractions and purification steps were done as described before (19Koronakis V. Li J. Koronakis E. Stauffer K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 617-626Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Purified TolC was also used to raise polyclonal antibody in rabbits.Protein Assays and Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed by standard techniques. When indicated in the figures, the reducing agent DTT and heat denaturation step were omitted from the sample preparation procedure. In all other cases, DTT was added to protein samples as a part of the SDS-sample buffer just prior to the electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized with anti-AcrA, anti-AcrB, and anti-TolC rabbit polyclonal antibodies and the alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) (7Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Google Scholar).To determine the intracellular concentrations of AcrA, AcrB, and TolC and the amounts of co-purified proteins we used a quantitative immunoblotting approach. Whole cell lysates, membrane fractions or purified proteins were separated by the SDS-PAGE. AcrA, AcrB, or TolC were detected using immunoblotting with corresponding polyclonal antibodies. For each experiment, the respective purified proteins in increasing concentrations were loaded onto the same gels to serve as standards for the calibration. The alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and the chromogenic reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrates were used to visualize protein bands. Quantification of immunoblots was done on a GS710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad).Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation—Cells were grown to A600 of 0.6–0.8 in 50 ml of LB medium with an appropriate antibiotic and collected by centrifugation. Disruption of cells by EDTA-lysozyme treatment was performed as described previously (20Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were fragmented into membrane vesicles by sonication (Misonix Inc., XL 2020) for 45 s on ice. Then, the membrane vesicles in 20% sucrose solution containing 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) were layered as 1.6-ml fractions on a two-step gradient consisting of 3.2 ml of 60% sucrose and 7.5 ml of 25% sucrose. All subsequent steps for membrane purification and floatation were performed as described by Ishidate et al. (22Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S. Glauner B. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 428-443Google Scholar). Briefly, after centrifugation in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 3.5 h, two adjacent bands at 25–60% sucrose interface were collected together by puncturing the side of the tube with a needle attached to a syringe. The resulting suspension (0.6–0.9 ml) was diluted with 5 mm EDTA and was then applied on the top of 11 ml of a 30–60% (w/w) sucrose gradient. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h, and fractions (0.1–0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Separated IM and OM samples were further subjected to a floatation gradient centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 h. After centrifugation all fractions were analyzed by the SDS-PAGE and visualized by the silver staining technique or Western blotting. The NADH-oxidase activity was measured as before (20Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Google Scholar). Sucrose concentrations (%) were converted into density values (g/ml) using tabulated values for sucrose in water at 5 °C (21Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. CRC Press, Cleveland1975Google Scholar).Co-purification Experiments—For co-purification experiments, E. coli cells carrying the corresponding plasmids were grown in 0.5 liter of LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to A600 ∼ 0.8–1.0, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). All centrifugation steps were carried out at +4 °C. We found that the cell lysis by French Press led to the disruption of the AcrAB-TolC complexes. Therefore, in all co-purification experiments we used EDTA-lysozyme treatment followed by osmotic shock to convert cells into spheroplasts. Then spheroplasts were sonicated for 45 s. Unbroken cells were removed by low speed centrifugation, and membranes were collected by centrifugation for 1 h at 250,000 × g. The membrane pellet was washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to remove lysozyme and EDTA and resuspended in 1 ml of the column binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl). An equal volume of 10% Triton X-100 in the binding buffer was then slowly added to the membrane suspension and left on ice for at least 2 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 70,000 × g. Triton X-100 in the concentration of 5% efficiently solubilized all three AcrAHis, AcrBHis, and TolCHis proteins. However, the high detergent concentration interfered with the binding of the His6-tagged proteins to Ni+2-NTA resin (Novagen). To improve binding to the matrix we substituted Ni2+ ions with Cu2+. Solubilized membrane proteins were loaded onto a Cu+2-NTA column equilibrated with the binding buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (equilibration buffer). The column was washed with equilibration buffer containing 100 mm imidazole (60 mm in the case of AcrAHis), and then proteins were eluted in the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole.To analyze the effect of ionophores, substrates, and the inhibitor on the assembly of complexes, AG100AX E. coli cells containing pABHis or pAB408His plasmids were grown to A600 of 0.6–0.8 in 100 ml of LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in potassium-sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), resuspended in the same buffer, and incubated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) in concentrations of 5, 20, or 100 μm, puromycin (PUR) (64 μg/ml), oleandomycin (OLE) (250 μg/ml), proflavine (PRO) (12.5 μg/ml), and Phe-Arg β-napthylamide (MC-207,110) (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)), and subjected to the osmotic EDTA-lysozyme lysis. The His6-tagged proteins were purified as described above.Chemical Cross-linking—Chemical in vivo cross-linking was carried out as described previously (12Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4264-4267Google Scholar). Dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate (DSP) in a concentration of 400 μm was used as a cross-linking agent. Reaction mixtures were incubated at +37 °C for 30 min. Cross-linking was terminated by adding Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) to the final concentration of 75 mm. For the analysis of the cross-linked complexes, reducing agents were omitted from the sample buffer.RESULTSAcrA and AcrB Co-migrate with Both the Inner and Outer Membranes in Sucrose Density Gradient—To elucidate how the intermembrane AcrAB-TolC complex is assembled, we first determined the distribution of AcrA, AcrB, and TolC proteins in membrane fractions after separation of the IM and OM by sucrose density equilibrium centrifugation (Fig. 1). For this purpose, E. coli cells were converted into spheroplasts by EDTA-lysozyme treatment (20Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Google Scholar). Crude membranes were first purified by sedimentation in a two-step sucrose gradient and then subjected to sedimentation through a 30–60% sucrose gradient, following the technique of Ishidate et al. (22Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S. Glauner B. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 428-443Google Scholar). Because of their different lipid compositions, the IM and OM migrate to different positions on a sucrose gradient, 1.16–1.18 and 1.22–1.26 g/ml, respectively (20Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Google Scholar, 22Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S. Glauner B. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 428-443Google Scholar). We used three criteria to evaluate the efficiency of separation: (i) fractionation of known integral OM proteins (OmpA, OmpF/C, and TolC) at a density of 1.22–1.26 g/ml, which is a characteristic for the OM; (ii) fractionation of NADH-oxidase activity only at a density of 1.16–1.18 g/ml, which is characteristic for the IM; and (iii) floatation of membrane fractions separated by sedimentation into the same densities of sucrose (22Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S. Glauner B. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 428-443Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 1A, vast amounts of OmpF/C and OmpA fractionated with the OM (Fig. 1A). Previous reports indicated that trimeric, fully assembled TolC is located exclusively in the OM (19Koronakis V. Li J. Koronakis E. Stauffer K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 617-626Google Scholar). Similarly, using immunoblotting with anti-TolC antibody we found trimeric TolC only in the OM fractions (Fig. 1C). The NADH activity clearly co-migrated with the IM (Fig. 1B). This fractionation was not affected by the lack of AcrB or TolC proteins. To confirm that there was no cross-contamination between the separated membranes, regions of the sedimentation gradient corresponding to the IM and OM were further purified by the density floatation fractionation. For this purpose, the appropriate fractions were pooled together as indicated in Fig. 1C and analyzed by floatation gradient centrifugation. Consistent with the previous studies, the IM fraction was resolved into a single peak with apparent buoyant density of 1.18 g/ml. The OM fractionated into a single peak of density 1.23–1.26 g/ml (data not shown). Thus, the centrifugation in the sucrose density gradients efficiently separates the IM and OM. We estimate that after separation the nonspecific cross-contamination between the two membranes is only about 5–10%.AcrA is entirely located in the periplasm and postulated to interact with both the IM and OM. In three independent experiments, immunoblotting of the sucrose gradient fractions of membranes isolated from the wild type (ZK4) E. coli showed that 45 ± 4% of AcrA was present in the IM and 26 ± 1% of the protein co-migrated with the OM fractions (Figs. 1C and 2C). The rest of AcrA is distributed in the intermediate density fraction and on the top of the gradient. When the separated IM and OM were subjected to density floatation fractionation, AcrA co-floated with both membranes into 1.16–1.18 g/ml and 1.23–1.25 g/ml densities, respectively (Fig. 1D).Fig. 2TolC is required for AcrB but not AcrA association with the outer membrane.A, anti-AcrA immunodetection in membranes lacking AcrB (E. coli AG102MB, delAcrB) and TolC (E. coli ZK796, delTolC). B, anti-AcrB immunodetection in membranes lacking AcrA (ECM2112 carrying pBP184 and pTrc99a-TolC plasmids overproducing AcrB and TolC, respectively) and TolC (delTolC). C, quantification of AcrA distribution between the IM and OM in the strains with different genetic backgrounds. Area densities of immunostained bands corresponding to AcrA were quantified as in Fig. 1D. The amounts of AcrA associated with the IM or OM were calculated from the appropriate fractions as a percentage of the total AcrA present in all fractions. Averages ± S.D. of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous studies showed that AcrA and AcrB form a stable complex in the IM (12Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4264-4267Google Scholar). If the OM-bound AcrA remains associated with AcrB, the latter should also be present in the OM fractions. We found that the majority of AcrB (70 ± 5%) co-fractionated with the IM on sucrose gradients (Fig. 1C). However, about 20% of AcrB co-migrated with the high density OM and the intermediate density fractions. The immunoblotting analysis of sucrose fractions without heat denaturation of proteins prior to electrophoresis showed that high density AcrB fractions contained several forms of protein: an AcrB monomer with an apparent molecular mass about 110 kDa and AcrB-containing high molecular weight (HMW) species with molecular masses of >200 kDa (Fig. 1C). To rule out protein aggregation as a possible cause of AcrB fractionation into high density regions of sucrose, the separated OM fractions were subjected to floatation centrifugation. We found that, similar to AcrA, AcrB remained bound to the OM during density floatation centrifugation (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, when OM fractions were subjected to the second round of sucrose density centrifugation in the presence of salts and chaotropic agents, both AcrA and AcrB still co-migrated with OM (data not shown). These results suggested that fractions of AcrA and AcrB could exist in a tight association with the OM.TolC Is Essential for the Co-fractionation of AcrAB with OM—To test if AcrB is required for AcrA association with the IM and OM, we fractionated AcrA in the AG102MB strain deficient in AcrB (Fig. 2A, delAcrB). We found that in the absence of AcrB the distribution of AcrA between the two membranes changed. Unlike AcrA in the WT strain, which fractionated 45%/26% with the IM and OM, respectively, in the delAcrB membranes 15 ± 3% of total AcrA co-migrated with the OM and the majority of AcrA (48 ± 1%) still co-migrated in the IM (Fig. 2C). In addition, the increased amounts of AcrA were present in the region of <1.16 g/ml sucrose gradient, which is mostly devoid of the IM proteins (Fig. 2A). This result suggested that AcrA is bound to the IM and OM even in the absence of AcrB. However, the interaction of AcrA with the OM is severed, and the protein is easily pulled away from the membranes.Because more AcrA co-fractionates with the OM in the presence of AcrB, the AcrB transporter could be the driving component of association with the OM. AcrB contains a large periplasmic domain, which might establish interaction with TolC even in the absence of AcrA (14Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). However, in the absence of AcrA we found only traces of AcrB in the OM fractions, even when AcrB and TolC were overproduced from the plasmids in the strain ECM2112 deficient of chromosomal copies of acrAB and tolC (Fig. 2B). Thus, AcrB alone cannot co-fractionate with the OM. Only the presence of both proteins, AcrA and AcrB, in the cytoplasmic membrane leads to the formation of specialized regions that co-fractionate in the sucrose gradient with the OM.The outer membrane channel TolC has been reported to be indispensable for the multidrug resistance phenotype of E. coli (8Fralick J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5803-5805Google Scholar). However, the direct interaction between TolC and AcrAB has been elusive (12Zgurskaya"
https://openalex.org/W2068975867,"Activated B cells differentiate to plasma cells to secrete IgM or, after undergoing class switch recombination (CSR), to secrete other classes of immunoglobulins1,2,3,4. Diversification of antibody function by CSR is important for humoral immunity. However, it remains unclear how the decision for the bifurcation is made. Bach2 is a B-cell-specific transcription repressor interacting with the small Maf proteins whose expression is high only before the plasma cell stage5,6,7. Here we show that Bach2 is critical for CSR and somatic hypermutation (SHM)2,4,8 of immunoglobulin genes. Genetic ablation of Bach2 in mice revealed that Bach2 was required for both T-cell-independent and T-cell-dependent IgG responses and SHM. When stimulated in vitro, Bach2-deficient B cells produced IgM, as did wild-type cells, and abundantly expressed Blimp-1 (refs 9, 10) and XBP-1 (ref. 11), critical regulators of the plasmacytic differentiation12, indicating that Bach2 was not required for the plasmacytic differentiation itself. However, they failed to undergo efficient CSR. These findings define Bach2 as a key regulator of antibody response and provide an insight into the orchestration of CSR and SHM during plasma cell differentiation."

Although intraperitoneal paraquat injections in mice cause a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the exact mechanism involved is still poorly understood.

It affects over one million people in North America (1Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Google Scholar, 2Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Google Scholar). Epidemiological evidence has suggested that environmental agents in combination with genetic susceptibility may be responsible for the associated neurodegeneration in PD (3Tanner C.M. Ottman R. Goldman S.M. Ellenberg J. Chan P. Mayeux R. Langston J.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 281: 341-346Google Scholar). Exposure to agricultural chemicals via living in a rural environment, drinking well water, or occupational exposure has been postulated to be a potential environmental risk factor for the disease (4Hertzman C.

The widely used herbicide 1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridium (paraquat) has been suggested as a prime risk factor for PD based both on reports of parkinsonism correlated with exposure to the agent (4Hertzman C.

Neurology. 1997; 48: 1583-1588Google Scholar) and on the similarity of the chemical structure of paraquat to the active metabolite of the parkinsonism-inducing agent 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium ion (MPP+). Although recent studies have shown that paraquat, either alone or in combination with the dithiocarbamate fungicide manganese ethylenebisdithiocarbamate, results in preferential degeneration of the nigrostriatal system (11Thiruchelvam M. Richfield E.K. Baggs R.B. Tank A.W. CorySlechta D.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9207-9214Google Scholar, 12McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms by which paraquat induces dopaminergic neuronal cell death are not yet fully understood. Understanding the mechanism that mediates paraquat-selective degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons may provide insights into more effective therapeutic approaches for the disease. A variety of extracellular stimuli elicit cellular activities such as survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis through the activation of a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) consisting of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the p38 MAPK, and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (13Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar, 14Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Google Scholar). The JNKs, also known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), serve as phosphorylation substrates for MAP kinase kinases (MKKs) such as MKK4/7, which are activated in turn by phosphorylation via MAP kinase kinase kinases (MKKKs). JNK is activated in response to many different stress factors including heat shock, inflammatory cytokines, protein synthesis inhibitors, growth factor withdrawal, chemotherapeutic drugs, and ultraviolet irradiation (15Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar, 16Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Google Scholar). However, the role of JNK signaling pathway in cell death is highly controversial. JNK activation has been implicated in both cell survival and cell death in response to stress depending on the cell type or the stimulus (13Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar, 15Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that the JNK signal transduction pathway may be involved in PD and that blocking the activity of the JNK protein kinases may be effective in preventing disease-related neuropathology (for a review, see Ref. 17Peng J. Andersen J.K. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 267-271Google Scholar). For example, the activation of the JNK signaling pathway converging on the phosphorylation of c-Jun has been associated with the induction of apoptosis in MPTP-treated mice (18Saporito M.S. Thomas B.A. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1200-1208Google Scholar, 19Xia X.G. Harding T. Weller M. Bieneman A. Uney J.B. Schulz J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10433-10438Google Scholar). These and related findings prompted us to assess the changes in c-Jun and the JNK pathway activity in dopaminergic neurons during paraquat-induced cell death, a recently established model of the disease (12McCormack A.L.

We report here evidence that suggests a role for the JNK pathway in paraquat-mediated apoptosis of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Reagents—Paraquat, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), protease inhibitor mixture, and monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and SDS-PAGE gels were obtained from Bio-Rad. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-JNK, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), anti-c-Jun, and anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit and sheep anti-tyrosine hydroxylase polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Media and sera were from Invitrogen. The ERK inhibitor PD98059, the p38 inhibitor SB202190, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 were from Calbiochem. Benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-fluoromethylketone (Z-DEVD-fmk) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Rabbit anti-4-hydroxynonenal antibody was from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). Manganese(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) was purchased from OXIS International Inc. (Portland, Oregon). CEP-11004 was a gift from Cephalon (West Chester, PA). Cell Culture—N27 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell viability was determined by MTT incorporation (20Peng J. Wu Z. Wu Y. Hsu M. Stevenson F.F. Boonplueang R. Roffler-Tarlov S.K. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44285-44291Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of signaling pathways on cell death, the inhibitors listed above were added 1 h prior to paraquat. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Caspase-3 activity was examined using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Bio-Rad) (20Peng J. Wu Z. Wu Y. Hsu M. Stevenson F.F. Boonplueang R. Roffler-Tarlov S.K. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44285-44291Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of protein from each sample was incubated with the synthetic substrate cabobenzoxy-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (Z-DEVD-AFC) for 2 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured using a microplate spectrofluorometer (excitation at 400 nm, emission at 530 nm). Serial dilutions of AFC were used as standards. A negative control in which caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CMK) was added and a positive control containing apopain were used to test the efficacy of the assay. Paraquat Administration—Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were intraperitoneally injected with either saline or 7 mg/kg paraquat dichloride hydrate (dissolved in saline) at 2-day intervals for a total of 10 doses. Animals were killed at day 7 or 8 after the last administration. The JNK pathway inhibitor CEP-11004 (1 mg/kg) was administered to mice by subcutaneous injection 1 day prior to paraquat administration at 2-day intervals for a total of 10 doses and for 7 days following the last paraquat injection on alternative days. Experimental protocols were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Use of Live Animals and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Buck Institute. Primary Mesencephalic Cultures—Primary mesencephalic cell cultures were prepared from embryonic gestation day 14 mouse embryos. Ventral mesencephalic tissue was mechanically dissociated by mild trituration in ice-cold calcium and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced saline solution (Invitrogen) and incubated with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA at 37 °C for 15 min. Dissociated cells were transferred to neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% B27 supplement, 2 mm glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well culture plates at a density of 7 × 105 cells/well. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. After 4 days, one-half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were grown an additional 2 days and then treated with 40 μm paraquat for 18 or 24 h. Immunocytochemistry—Cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with blocking buffer (2% horse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5). Primary antibodies were added at 4 °C overnight and included the following: sheep anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) polyclonal antibody (1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK (1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun (1:100), and rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:100). The secondary antibodies were rhodamine-conjugated rat-absorbed donkey anti-sheep IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated pig anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories; 1:200). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) was used to counterstain nuclei, and fluorescence signals were detected using a Nikon E800 microscope. Cell Counts in Primary Mesencephalic Cultures—The total number of TH-positive neurons in mesencephalic cultures was counted in every well in at least three wells after 24 h of paraquat treatment. The percentage of TH-positive neurons as compared with that of untreated cells was used to evaluate paraquat toxicity. Phospho-JNK, phospho-c-Jun, and activated caspase-3-positive neurons among TH-positive neurons were scored across the well (×20 objective). Experiments were repeated four times with cultures isolated from independent dissections. Western Blot Analysis—Brain tissue or cell cultures were homogenized on ice in freshly prepared buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant was measured using a commercially available protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. Transfers were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibodies (p-JNK, 1:1000; JNK, 1:1000; p-ERK1/2, 1:1000; p-p38, 1:1000; p-c-Jun, 1:1000; cleaved caspase-3, 1:1000; β-actin, 1:5000) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoblotting was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The protein gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to assure equal loading of protein. Immunohistochemistry—Following perfusion with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, brains were removed, immersion-fixed in the same fixative overnight, and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose. Serial coronal sections (40 μm) were cut on a cryostat. For double immunolabeling studies, sections were incubated with blocking solution (2% horse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5) and then with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight followed by secondary antibodies in blocking solution at room temperature for 2 h. The primary antibodies used were sheep anti-TH polyclonal antibody (1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK (1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun (1:100), and rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:100). The secondary antibodies were rhodamine-conjugated rat-absorbed donkey anti-sheep IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated pig anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories; 1:200). Sections were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and fluorescence signals were detected using a Nikon E800 microscope. For stereology studies, cryostat-cut sections were taken through the entire midbrain. TH-positive neurons were immunolabeled by incubating the tissue sections successively with a rabbit polyclonal anti-TH antibody (1:200) and biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories) and following the staining procedure outlined by the manufacturer of the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) in combination with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine reagents. TH-positive neuronal counts were performed by using a computer-assisted image analysis system consisting of a Zeiss Axioplan2 photomicroscope equipped with a Neurolucida stereo investigator (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT). TH-positive neurons were counted in the SNpc of every second section throughout the entire extent of the SNpc. Each midbrain section was viewed at low power (×10 objective), and the SNpc was outlined by using the set of anatomical landmarks. Then at a random start, the number of TH-positive neurons was counted at high power (×100, numerical aperture 1.30 oil immersion objective). After all sections from the SNpc were analyzed, the total number of neurons in the SNpc was estimated by multiplying the number of neurons counted within the sampled regions with the reciprocals of the fraction of the sectional area sampled and the fraction of the section thickness sampled (21West M.J. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 51-61Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments performed. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using analysis of variance and post hoc Students' t test. Values of p < 0.05 were taken as being statistically significant. Paraquat Induces Dopaminergic Cell Apoptosis in Vitro—N27 is a dopaminergic cell line derived by SV40 immortalization of rat midbrain neurons from isolated mesencephalic cultures (22Prasad K.N. Carvalho E. Kentroti S. Edwards-Prasad J. Freed C. Vernadakis A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1994; 30A: 596-603Google Scholar). The N27 cell line produces dopamine and expresses the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transport. This cell line has been used for comparing the effects of various neurotoxins in dopaminergic neurons and is therefore a suitable model system to study the role that paraquat-mediated oxidative stress may have on JNK activation as it relates to Parkinson's disease. Incubation of N27 cells with various concentrations of paraquat for 24 h significantly affected cell viability. As shown in Fig. 1A, paraquat reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Cell death was accompanied by an increase in caspase activation; Western blot analysis of the caspase-3 cleavage product p17 protein in cells 18 h after paraquat treatment showed a marked increase in its levels as compared with the control protein β-actin (Fig. 1B). This suggests that paraquat-induced cell death is at least in part apoptotic. Paraquat Activates JNK but Not ERK and p38 in Vitro—Paraquat is known to generate superoxide (23Bus J.S. Gibson J.E. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 55: 37-46Google Scholar). The specific signal transduction pathways involved in cellular responses to superoxide vary with cell type. For example, Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79) cells respond with a rapid but transient activation of both p38 and JNK (24Han M.J. Kim B.Y. Yoon S.O. Chung A.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 15: 94-101Google Scholar), whereas ERK and p38 are selectively activated in primary rat microglia (25Parvathenani L.K. Tertyshnikova S. Greco C.R. Roberts S.B. Robertson B. Posmantur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13309-13317Google Scholar). To determine whether specific MAPK signal transduction pathways are involved in cellular responses to paraquat, we measured changes in the expression of phosphoactivated forms of JNK, p38, and ERK. Using phosphospecific antibodies against JNK, p38, and ERK, we found that exposure to paraquat for 12-18 h resulted in a progressive increase in immunoreactivity for phospho-JNK, whereas antibody against total JNK showed no paraquat-induced change in expression (Fig. 2). In contrast, paraquat did not induce the phosphoactivation of either p38 or ERK. Because JNK activation has been suggested to be involved in the induction of apoptosis by different insults (13Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar, 15Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar), we examined whether paraquat was able to activate JNK in cells through phosphorylation of its specific substrate c-Jun transcription factor. As shown in Fig. 2, the level of phospho-c-Jun increased as the duration of paraquat exposure increased up to 18 h. This sustained phosphorylation did not result from the increased expression of c-Jun as protein levels were unaltered relative to untreated samples. Inhibition of JNK Kinase Attenuates Paraquat-induced Cell Death in Vitro—To investigate further the relationship between paraquat induction of MAPK signaling pathways and paraquat-induced cell death, we used a series of kinase inhibitors to inactivate the ERK, p38, and JNK receptors. We expected that whether a particular kinase were critical for the effects of paraquat on cell death, inhibiting its activity should reverse these effects. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (7 μm) blocked paraquat up-regulation of caspase-3 activity, whereas the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm) and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm) were ineffective, although SB203580 (10 μm) inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and PD98059 (20 μm) inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK in N27 cells (Fig. 3C). Both the superoxide dismutase mimetic manganese(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (200 μm) and a relatively specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk (25 μm) also attenuated paraquat-mediated caspase-3 activity. Similarly, MnTBAP, SP600125, and Z-DEVD-fmk also protected N27 cells from paraquat-induced death, whereas the other inhibitors were ineffective in this regard (Fig. 3B). The above results collectively suggest that both superoxide production and JNK activation are required for paraquat-induced caspase-mediated cell death of N27 cells in vitro. Paraquat Induces JNK Activity in Primary Mesencephalic Cultures—N27 is a transformed cell line that may have survival mechanisms that are absent in normal primary dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, to verify the role of the JNK signaling pathway in paraquat-induced cell death on a cellular level in primary dopamine neurons, we explored the effects of paraquat treatment in primary mesencephalic cultures via immunofluorescence with antibodies specific for both tyrosine hydroxylase and phospho-c-Jun, phospho-JNK, and activated caspase-3, coupled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. In untreated control cultures, there was virtually no coexpression of phospho-c-Jun, phospho-JNK, and activated caspase-3 in TH-positive neurons (Fig. 4). In primary mesencephalic cultures treated with 40 μm paraquat for 18 h, however, colocalization of phospho-c-Jun, phospho-JNK, and activated caspase-3 was apparent in TH-positive neurons (Fig. 4). To investigate further the relationship between paraquat induction of the JNK signaling pathway and paraquat-induced TH-positive neuronal death, we first treated neurons with MnTBAP (100 μm) or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (5 μm), beginning 1 h prior to paraquat treatment. Fig. 5A shows that both MnTBAP and SP600125 reduced the colocalization of phospho-c-Jun and phospho-JNK and activated caspase-3 with TH-positive neurons after 18 h of paraquat treatment. Cells were stained for TH at 24 h after paraquat treatment, and TH-positive cells were counted. As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (5 μm) protected TH-positive neurons from paraquat-induced death, whereas the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (8 μm) were ineffective. Both MnTBAP (100 μm) and Z-DEVD-fmk (25 μm) also attenuated paraquat-mediated TH-positive neuron death (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that superoxide production via paraquat results in the activation of the JNK signaling pathway and subsequent apoptotic neuronal death of dopaminergic midbrain neurons. Paraquat Treatment Results in JNK Activation in Nigral Dopaminergic Neurons in Vivo—To determine whether JNK is activated in SNpc neurons after paraquat administration in vivo, we performed immunofluorescent double-labeling experiments using TH as a dopaminergic marker. In midbrain tissues from untreated mouse brains, phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun immunostaining were weak and diffusely cytoplasmic in nigral dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 6A). However, in tissues from mice treated with paraquat, this cytoplasmic immunolocalization within dopamine neurons exhibited a bright speckled appearance that became progressively more intense by 7 days (Fig. 6A) after the last paraquat administration. At the same time point after paraquat treatment, we detected the expression of activated caspase-3 in the cytosol of a substantial number of dopaminergic neurons using an antibody specifically recognizing cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 6A). Similar results were found with regard to the differences in duration of JNK activation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and caspase-3 activation via Western blot analysis (Fig. 6B). Paraquat Decreases the Number of Nigral Dopaminergic Neurons—To examine the neurodegenerative effects of systemic paraquat administration on SNpc dopaminergic neurons in mice, we also assessed midbrain sections immunostained with TH antibody. As shown previously (12McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Google Scholar), TH immunohistochemistry revealed a significant depletion of TH-positive neurons in the SNpc at day 8 after the last injection (Fig. 7A). In contrast, no marked reduction in TH-positive neurons was seen in the ventral tegmental area as compared with that in controls (Fig. 7A). By using stereological techniques, we counted the number of nigral TH-positive neurons in saline-or paraquat-injected mice at day 8 after the last administration. As shown in Fig. 7B, paraquat administration results in a 29% reduction in nigral TH-positive neurons in mice as compared with saline-injected controls. Conversely, administration of CEP-11004 immediately prior to paraquat completely protected against these toxic effects, and indeed, the counts of TH-positive neurons were not different in the substantia nigra of mice injected with paraquat plus CEP-11004 as compared with saline-treated controls (Fig. 7B), suggesting the critical role of the JNK signal pathway in paraquat-mediated nigral dopaminergic neuronal death. The major finding of this study is the critical role for JNK/c-Jun in mediating signals contributing to the selective dopaminergic neuronal death induced by paraquat. Our data demonstrate that neurons undergoing paraquat-induced apoptosis activated the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor c-Jun. This activation was regulated by post-translational mechanisms through the sustained activation of the JNK pathway. Induction of c-Jun activity in degenerating dopaminergic neurons preceded caspase-3 activation and neuronal death. These events appear to have functional importance in regulating dopaminergic neuronal survival and death from neurotoxicants and environmental stresses. The mechanism of paraquat neurotoxicity is most likely mediated via oxidative stress. Paraquat generates superoxide by both electron transfer reactions with NADH-dependent oxireductases and redox cycling via reaction with molecular oxygen (23Bus J.S. Gibson J.E. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 55: 37-46Google Scholar, 26Clejan L. Cederbaum A.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1779-1786Google Scholar, 27Burkitt M.J. Kadiiska M.B. Hanna P.M. Jordan S.J. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 257-263Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that neuronal-derived superoxide plays an important role in paraquat neurotoxicity (28Patel M. Day B.J. Crapo J.D. Fridovich I. McNamara J.O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 345-355Google Scholar). Several neurotoxicants, including MPP+, rotenone, dieldrin, manganese, and salsolinol, induce increases in superoxide and related reactive oxygen species and subsequent activation of the JNK pathway, which precedes apoptosis (29Chun H.S. Gibson G.E. DeGiorgio L.A. Zhang H. Kidd V.J. Son J.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1010-1021Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, our data show that MnTBAP, a unique category of superoxide dismutase mimetic, prevents paraquat-induced JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis. Other anti-oxidants including N-acetylcysteine and catalase have also been shown to inhibit dopamine-induced apoptotic death via an oxidative stress-involved JNK signaling pathway (30Luo Y. Umegaki H. Wang X. Abe R. Roth G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3756-3764Google Scholar). Following paraquat administration, the following sequence of events presumably takes place: superoxide production triggers JNK activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun. These effects preceded and triggered up-regulation of caspase-3 activation, which in turn contributes to the apoptotic response. The fact that inhibition of activated ERK by PD98059 and p38 by SB203580 did not suppress apoptosis suggests that ERK and p38 are not significantly involved in the paraquat-induced apoptotic pathway of dopaminergic neurons. On the other hand, inhibition of JNK activation by the novel JNK inhibitor SP600125 (31Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar) significantly attenuated activation of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis, suggesting that JNK activation occurs upstream of caspase-3. The results described in this study map the early signaling events by which the activation of JNK after paraquat treatment can lead to apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons. JNK is involved in many cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (13Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar, 15Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar). It is thought that the duration of its activation may be crucial in the signaling decision; sustained JNK activation participates in the dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis induced by several neurotoxicants (18Saporito M.S. Thomas B.A. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1200-1208Google Scholar, 19Xia X.G. Harding T. Weller M. Bieneman A. Uney J.B. Schulz J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10433-10438Google Scholar, 29Chun H.S. Gibson G.E. DeGiorgio L.A. Zhang H. Kidd V.J. Son J.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1010-1021Google Scholar, 30Luo Y. Umegaki H. Wang X. Abe R. Roth G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3756-3764Google Scholar). Increased oxidative stress via antisense inactivation of superoxide dismutase in PC12 cells in vitro was found to activate JNK (32Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Bozyczko-Coyne D. O'Kane T.M. Neff N.T. Tolkovsky A.M. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Troy C.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1901-1912Google Scholar). We have shown that prolonged phosphorylation of JNK, accompanied by phosphorylation of c-Jun, is an important step in the apoptotic signaling cascade induced by paraquat. The activation of JNK results in c-Jun phosphorylation, suggesting that this protein kinase plays an important role in regulating c-Jun transcriptional activity. Activated c-Jun is implicated in many neuronal cell death paradigms (33Herdegen T. Skene P. Bahr M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 227-231Google Scholar, 34Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of c-Jun has been shown to be essential for dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis induced by MPTP (19Xia X.G. Harding T. Weller M. Bieneman A. Uney J.B. Schulz J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10433-10438Google Scholar). Inhibition of c-Jun activity by dominant-negative overexpression, neutralizing antibody injection, and genetic disruption blocks sympathetic neuronal apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal (35Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Google Scholar, 36Palmada M. Kanwal S. Rutkoski N.J. Gustafson-Brown C. Johnson R.S. Wisdom R. Carter B.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 453-461Google Scholar). Moreover, sympathetic neurons carrying a mutant c-Jun gene (JunAA) that lacks the two critical N-terminal phosphorylation site serines 63 and 73 are resistant to apoptosis induced by the excitatory amino acid kainate (37Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Google Scholar). In addition, we investigated the protective effects of a selective caspase-3 inhibitor as well as the JNK inhibitor SP600125 in preventing paraquat-mediated cell death (Figs. 3 and 5). Cytochrome c and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) or DIABLO are two key modulators of the intrinsic cell death pathway. Numerous recent studies have shown that activated JNK is involved in cytochrome c or Smac/DIABLO release into the cytoplasm, where it can complex with apoptosis-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and caspase-9, causing the activation of this initiator caspase (38Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Google Scholar, 39Chauhan D. Li G. Hideshima T. Podar K. Mitsiades C. Mitsiades N. Munshi N. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17593-17596Google Scholar). Caspase-9, in turn, can cleave and activate the downstream executioner caspase-3. This results in the cleavage of additional cellular substrates, leading to the morphological changes associated with apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (40Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 111-121Google Scholar). In support of the idea that the JNK signaling cascade is a direct activator of the paraquat-mediated SNpc dopaminergic neuronal death, we found that paraquat-induced death is suppressed by CEP-11004 (Fig. 7). Screening of upstream kinases in the JNK pathway has demonstrated that CEP-11004 acts by inhibiting upstream mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) (41Murakata C. Kaneko M. Gessner G. Angeles T.S. Ator M.A. O'Kane T.M. McKenna B.A. Thomas B.A. Mathiasen J.R. Saporito M.S. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Hudkins R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 147-150Google Scholar). CEP-11004 has been found to reduce apoptosis in several neuronal apoptosis paradigms, including nerve growth factor deprivation, Aβ1-42, and MPP+ (41Murakata C. Kaneko M. Gessner G. Angeles T.S. Ator M.A. O'Kane T.M. McKenna B.A. Thomas B.A. Mathiasen J.R. Saporito M.S. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Hudkins R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 147-150Google Scholar). Furthermore, CEP-11004 has been shown to be an effective neuroprotectant in the MPTP model of PD in vivo (41Murakata C. Kaneko M. Gessner G. Angeles T.S. Ator M.A. O'Kane T.M. McKenna B.A. Thomas B.A. Mathiasen J.R. Saporito M.S. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Hudkins R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 147-150Google Scholar, 42Teismann P. Tieu K. Choi D.K. Wu D.C. Naini A. Hunot S. Vila M. Jackson-Lewis V. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5473-5478Google Scholar). In summary, our data support the conclusion that the activation of JNK is a major component of the mechanism of sensitization of dopaminergic neurons to paraquat-mediated apoptosis. MnTBAP can block both paraquat-induced JNK activation and apoptosis, indicating that paraquat-induced oxidative stress is involved. Understanding the mechanisms leading to paraquat-induced neuronal death may lead to novel therapeutics in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Indeed the JNK inhibitor CEP-1347, an analogue of CEP-11004, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for PD. Our data, demonstrating the involvement of the JNK/c-Jun pathway in yet another model of the disease, strengthen the argument that JNK/c-Jun inhibitor may be an effective therapy for the disease.

https://openalex.org/W2124992697,"Many tumor cell types are sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Incubation of TRAIL-sensitive cells with TRAIL invariably leads to resistant survivors even when high doses of TRAIL are used. Because the emergence of resistance to apoptosis is a major concern in successful treatment of cancer, and TRAIL survivors may contribute to therapeutic failure, we investigated potential resistance mechanisms. We selected TRAIL-resistant SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cells by repeatedly treating them with high and/or low doses of TRAIL. The resulting TRAIL-resistant clones were not cross-resistant to Fas or paclitaxel. Expression of modulators of apoptosis was not changed in the resistant cells, including TRAIL receptors, cFLIP, Bax, Bid, or IAP proteins. Surprisingly, we found that DISC formation was deficient in multiple selected TRAIL-resistant clones. DR4 was not recruited to the DISC upon TRAIL treatment, and caspase-8 was not activated at the DISC. Although total cellular DR4 mRNA and protein were virtually identical in TRAIL-sensitive parental and TRAIL-resistant clones, DR4 protein expression on the cell surface was essentially undetectable in the TRAIL-resistant clones. Moreover, exogenous DR4 and KILLER/DR5 were not properly transported to the cell surface in the TRAIL-resistant cells. Interestingly, TRAIL-resistant cells were resensitized to TRAIL by tunicamycin pretreatment, which increased cell surface expression of DR4 and KILLER/DR5. Our data suggest that tumor cells may become resistant to TRAIL through regulation of the death receptor cell surface transport and that resistance to TRAIL may be overcome by the glycosylation inhibitor/endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agent tunicamycin.

These receptors have been classified into two groups, death-inducing receptors (TRAIL-R1 and -R2) and death-inhibitory receptors (TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, and osteoprotegerin). Both TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain a C-terminal death domain that signals downstream caspase activation to mediate TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death in a variety of tumor cell types. In contrast to these death-inducing receptors, TRAIL-R3, which shares homology with DR4/KILLER/DR5, is devoid of a cytoplasmic domain and exists as a glycophospholipid-anchored protein on the cell surface. TRAIL-R4 has a cytoplasmic domain containing a truncated death domain that cannot transmit a death signal but can weakly activate NF-κB, which may protect cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (10Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these two decoy receptors can protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by competing with the death-inducing TRAIL-Rs for TRAIL binding. Since TRAIL-R3 mRNA was preferentially found in normal cells but not in transformed cells, it is thought that TRAIL-R3 might be responsible for the cellular resistance of some normal cells to TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity (11MacFarlane M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a complex regulation of cellular susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis at the level of receptor expression.Apoptosis can be initiated by two distinct pathways: one is the “intrinsic pathway” mediated by the mitochondria, and the other is the “extrinsic pathway” mediated by death receptors. Activation of those two pathways ultimately results in cleavage of caspase-3 and induction of apoptosis. Cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways has been observed mainly as an amplification loop at the level of execution of each cascade. Depending on the relative contribution of mitochondria in death receptor-mediated apoptosis, tumor cells can be classified as type I or type II cells (14Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Apoptosis in type I cells can be induced by TRAIL or Fas without early involvement of the mitochondria pathway, and this death is not blocked by Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or caspase-9 inhibitors (15Ozoren N. El-Deiry W.S. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In type II cells, the amount of DISC-activated caspase-8 is not sufficient, and the mitochondria act as “amplifiers” of the apoptotic signal. Type II cell death is sensitive to inhibition by Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or caspase-9 inhibitors.TRAIL is a promising anti-cancer agent because it can preferentially kill tumor cells. Sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is a key factor influencing the efficacy of TRAIL treatment. However, the basis for the sensitivity and resistance of cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is not fully understood. In addition, TRAIL contributes to immune surveillance against tumor metastasis, which implies that tumors may gain more metastatic potential after acquiring resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (16Cretney E. Takeda K. Yagita H. Glaccum M. Peschon J.J. Smyth M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 17Takeda K. Hayakawa Y. Smyth M.J. Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Kakuta S. Iwakura Y. Yagita H. Okumura K. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar).Thus far, most studies of TRAIL resistance have focused on natural resistance, such as resistance of normal cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (18Zhang X.D. Nguyen T. Thomas W.D. Sanders J.E. Hersey P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of natural or intrinsic resistance may be different from those of acquired or adapted resistance. In the latter, tumor cells may survive after pro-longed treatment with TRAIL in cancer therapy or escape from TRAIL-mediated immune surveillance in vivo. Tumor cells can acquire resistance to apoptosis through interference with either intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways. Mutation of the Bcl-2 family member Bax can confer resistance to TRAIL induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells (19LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that Jurkat cells acquire resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis because their mitochondria lose the ability to release intermembrane proteins in response to Bid or Bax (20Wang G.Q. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Goldstein L.A. Rabinovitz A. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3610-3619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both HCT116 and Jurkat cells behave as Type II cells in which the mitochondrial pathway appears to play a major role in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Type II cells may develop resistance by modulation of the intrinsic pathway instead of the extrinsic pathway. Resistance in these cells may be overcome in some cases by combined application of chemotherapeutic drugs (19LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), which might bypass the mitochondrial pathway (21Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 100: 15095-15100Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Elucidation of acquired TRAIL resistance may lead to new therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance in cancer therapy with TRAIL. In addition, it may improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying how tumor cells escape from surveillance by the immune system and thereby provide novel strategies to prevent tumor development.In the present study, we investigated how tumor cells acquire resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TRAIL-resistant tumor cells were selected by eliminating apoptotic cells resulting from treatment with TRAIL. TRAIL-resistant clones were found not to be cross-resistant to Fas or paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. DISC formation was abrogated in TRAIL-resistant clones, apparently due to a defect in localization of DR4 in the plasma membrane. Strikingly, we found that pretreatment with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin specifically and efficiently restored the susceptibility of resistant clones to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Our studies provide a new mechanism through which tumor cells may acquire resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This mechanism suggests that pharmacological manipulation of cell surface expression of death receptors may be crucial to overcome resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis or maintain tumor cell sensitivity in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—The human colon cancer cell line SW480 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SW480 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Human recombinant human TRAIL ligand, His6 antibody, and anti-DR4 for immunofluorescence staining were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Anti-DR4, anti-KILLER/DR5, anti-DcR1, and anti-DcR2 antibody used for flow cytometric detection and functional application (block TRAIL receptors-mediated killing) were obtained from Alexis Corp. (Lausen, Switzerland). Anti-Bax and anti-caspase-3 antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. Anti-caspase-8 and anti-FLIP antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (San Diego, CA). Anti-KILLER/DR5, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-XL and anti-caspase-9 antibodies were purchased from IMGENEX (San Diego, CA). The mitochondria-selective carbocyanine dye 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cycloheximide and tunicamycin were obtained from Calbiochem, The mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (San Diego, CA).Generation of TRAIL-resistant SW480 Cells—Selection of TRAIL-resistant cells was performed as described previously (22Landowski T.H. Shain K.H. Oshiro M.M. Buyuksal I. Painter J.S. Dalton W.S. Blood. 1999; 94: 265-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 106 SW480 cells seeded in 100-mm dishes were treated with 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 24 h, resulting in ∼99% cell death. The apoptotic cells (cells floating in the medium) were then removed. Surviving cells growing in medium containing 10 ng/ml TRAIL up to 60–70% confluence were then treated with 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 24 h and allowed to regrow to 60–70% confluence again in 10 ng/ml TRAIL-containing medium. After five cycles, SW480 pooled clones resistant to TRAIL were obtained. Individual resistant clones were isolated using sterile cloning disks (Scienceware). The sensitivity of individual clones to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was subsequently examined by PI staining and flow cytometry.Colony Formation Assays—SW480 cells and TRAIL-resistant cells (5000/well) were plated in 12-well dishes and treated with TRAIL, Fas, or paclitaxel for 3 days. The cell culture medium was subsequently changed every 3 days, and after 2 weeks the resulting colonies were stained with Coomassie Blue (23Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37879-37886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PI Staining and Active Caspase-3 Assay—Cells were harvested at the indicated time periods (see figure legends) and prepared for detection of active caspase-3 by flow cytometry or stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry for sub-G1 content as described previously (30Gaeta M.L. Johnson D.R. Kluger M.S. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fluorescence was measured using an Epics Elite flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).Transfections—Transfections were carried out as described previously (24McDonald 3rd, E.R. Chui P.C. Martelli P.F. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14939-14945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, before transfection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded per well in 6-well plates. SW480 cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA with a 1:10 ratio of EGFP-spectrin co-expression vector using the Lipofectin transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications, and transfection efficiency was about 15–20%. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were collected and analyzed as indicated in the figure legends.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential Change during Cell Death—Cells were washed with 2 ml of PBS, rinsed with PBS, and suspended following treatment with 0.5 ml of trypsin (trypsin-EDTA; 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA). Cells were transferred to 15-ml conical tubes and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 300 μl of media with 100 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence was measured using an Epics Elite flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).Flow Cytometric Detection of Death Receptor Surface Expression— The experiments were performed as described previously (25Zhang X.D. Franco A.V. Nguyen T. Gray C.P. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3961-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 106 cells were rinsed and detached following the addition of 0.5 ml of trypsin (trypsin-EDTA; 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA·4Na). Cells were transferred to 15-ml conical tubes and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 5 min. Cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% FBS and then resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (PBS with 1% FBS) containing the primary antibody (10 μg/ml) against a death receptor or a nonspecific mouse IgG1 antibody as a control. After staining on ice for 60 min, cells were washed once with PBS containing 1% FBS and incubated with FITC- or phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody at 4 °C for 45 min in the dark. Cells were analyzed on an Epics Elite flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted from parental and TRAIL-resistant SW480 cells and then electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The mRNA expression level of human TRAIL death receptor DR4 and KILLER/DR5 was determined through hybridization to the membrane using full-length cDNAs of the death receptors as probes. Each probe was labeled by random priming as described previously (5Wu G.S. Burns T.F. McDonald III, E.R. Jiang W. Meng R. Krantz I.D. Kao G. Gan D.D. Zhou J.Y. Muschel R. Hamilton S.R. Spinner N.B. Markowitz S. Wu G. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Ethidium bromide staining of 28 and 18 S RNA was performed to evaluate the integrity of the RNA and to demonstrate equal RNA loading.Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Expression of DR4 and KILLER/DR5 RNA was also evaluated using RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the parental and TRAIL-resistant SW480 cells. cDNA was prepared using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscriptase II (Invitrogen) as previously described (26Kim K. Fisher M.J. Xu S.Q. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar). Primers used in these experiments were obtained from R&D Systems.Western Blotting—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (5Wu G.S. Burns T.F. McDonald III, E.R. Jiang W. Meng R. Krantz I.D. Kao G. Gan D.D. Zhou J.Y. Muschel R. Hamilton S.R. Spinner N.B. Markowitz S. Wu G. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In brief, a total of 20 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 10% Blotto (Carnation, Los Angeles, CA), incubated with different primary antibodies, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody used at a 1:5000 dilution. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis of DR4 —The DR4 cDNA was cloned in frame into the pcDNA3.1-Myc-HisA vector (Invitrogen) as an EcoRI/HindIII fragment. This C-terminally tagged Myc-His plasmid was subsequently mutagenized using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit following the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by sequencing, and in each case the entire cDNA was checked and verified for the absence of second site mutations.TRAIL DISC Immunoprecipitation—DISC IP was performed as described previously (24McDonald 3rd, E.R. Chui P.C. Martelli P.F. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14939-14945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 107 SW480 cells were plated to achieve 80% confluence in a T75 flask. Cells were then suspended following trypsin treatment, spun down, and resuspended in 2 ml of complete medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml His tagged-TRAIL and 1 μg/ml anti-His6 antibody (R&D Systems) for 15 min at 37 °C. For untreated control samples, the TRAIL was excluded. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min on ice in TRAIL DISC IP lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were cleared twice by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight with 30 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C to isolate the TRAIL DISC. The complexes were subsequently washed four times with TRAIL DISC IP lysis buffer and eluted with Immunopure Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce) with 0.1 m dithiothreitol at room temperature for 2 h. The protein complexes were methanol/chloroform (4:1)-precipitated and resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were performed to measure recruitment of specific endogenous proteins to the TRAIL DISC.Immunofluorescence Staining—This procedure was described previously (25Zhang X.D. Franco A.V. Nguyen T. Gray C.P. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3961-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, SW480 or TRAIL-resistant cells were plated on coverslips. Coverslips were washed two times with PBS containing 1% FBS. To detect the intracellular level of death receptors, some samples were permeabilized with 0.25% saponin and fixed with 2% formaldehyde, and other samples were stained without permeabilization and fixation. Samples were incubated at 4 °C with anti-DR4 or KILLER/DR5 antibody overnight at 4 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with secondary mouse anti-goat antibody conjugated to FITC (1:400; Caltag) at 4 °C for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After three 10-min washes with PBS with 1% FBS, cells were mounted onto slides with Pro-Long (Molecular Probes) mounting medium. Cells were visualized with a ×20 objective lens using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescent microscope, and images were recorded with an Optronics CCD-camera (DEI-750).RESULTSTRAIL-resistant SW480 Colon Cancer Cells Selected after Prolonged Treatment with TRAIL Were Not Cross-resistant to Fas- or Paclitaxel-induced Apoptosis—Although TRAIL has cytotoxic effects against most tumor cells, a fraction of a given sensitive tumor cell population cannot be killed even at high doses of TRAIL. To explore how these resistant survivors escape from TRAIL-induced death, we obtained TRAIL-resistant cell lines by subjecting SW480 human colon cancer cells to repeated exposure to different doses of recombinant TRAIL (see “Materials and Methods”). After five consecutive cycles of selection, we isolated 12 individual clones from a TRAIL-resistant pool of clones. Two of them remained as sensitive as the parental SW480 cells to TRAIL, and the other 10 clones showed resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We randomly chose clones R4, R6, and R10 for further experiments. As shown in Fig. 1, less than 20% apoptosis could be detected after exposure to 100 ng/ml TRAIL for 24 h in the three resistant clones, in contrast to more than 70% cell death observed in parental SW480 cells (p < 0.01). Extended exposure at higher doses or longer times of TRAIL treatment did not increase cell death, and there remained a high percentage of surviving cells. To ensure that resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was not simply due to clonal variation, we further examined six subclones of the TRAIL-resistant SW480 clone R4 derived by limiting dilution. All of them showed similar resistance to TRAIL as their parental clone R4 (data not shown). It has been reported that in vitro selection for resistance to some apoptosis-inducing stimuli may result in cross-resistance to other cytotoxic agents (20Wang G.Q. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Goldstein L.A. Rabinovitz A. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3610-3619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Landowski T.H. Shain K.H. Oshiro M.M. Buyuksal I. Painter J.S. Dalton W.S. Blood. 1999; 94: 265-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether our resistant clones also co-selected for resistance to Fas and paclitaxel, the parental SW480 cells and the resistant clones R4, R6, and R10 were treated with TRAIL, Fas, or paclitaxel. We found differences between parental and resistant cell clones only after TRAIL treatment but not following exposure to Fas or the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (Fig. 1, A and B). We found a significant change in mitochondrial membrane potential in TRAIL-sensitive SW480 cells after TRAIL exposure (p < 0.01) but not in TRAIL-resistant cells, whereas the change was similar in response following either Fas or paclitaxel when TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant cells were compared. (Fig. 1C). To confirm that R4, R6, and R10 became stably resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we also performed long term colony formation assays. We found that TRAIL-resistant clones formed colonies in medium containing 20 ng/ml TRAIL, whereas parental SW480 cells formed very few colonies. A low number of colonies was observed following exposure of either parental or TRAIL-resistant cells to either Fas or paclitaxel (Fig. 1D). Thus, TRAIL-resistant clones selected from prolonged incubation with TRAIL did not display cross-resistance to either Fas- or paclitaxel-mediated apoptotic signals.Expression of Major Apoptosis Mediators Does Not Change in TRAIL-resistant Clones Isolated following Prolonged TRAIL Exposure—Previous studies suggested that altered expression of proapoptotic or antiapoptotic genes in tumors often results in the avoidance of cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents or TRAIL (14Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar, 19LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of TRAIL resistance in the selected clones, we first examined the protein levels of molecules that are involved in the death receptor signaling pathway. We tested the expression of death receptors, including DR4, KILLER/DR5, DcR1, and DcR2, and found that protein levels were similar between TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant cell lines. DcR1 and DcR2 were expressed in TRAIL-sensitive SW480 cells, indicating that the relative expression of decoy receptors may not efficiently block apoptosis induced by TRAIL in some tumor cell lines (Fig. 2A). IAP family members are known negative regulators of apoptosis (27Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the expression level of IAP1 and IAP2 in the parental SW480 cells and in resistant clones and found no difference (data not shown). We also examined the mRNA levels of the TRAIL death receptors by RT-PCR and Northern blotting, and no apparent changes were observed in the resistant clones (Fig. 2C). The antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and FLIP can protect some tumor cell lines from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (23Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol.

Consumption of high calorie diets and sedentary lifestyles play major roles in this trend (2Kopelman P.G. Hitman G.A. Lancet. 1998; 352: SIV5Google Scholar, 4Flegal K.M. Carroll M.D. Ogden C.L.

Similarly, exposure to palatable diets with high caloric density (high in fat) induces a variable degree of weight gain and insulin resistance in mice (7West D.B. Boozer C.N. Moody D.L. Atkinson R.L.

We and others have proposed that a rapid increase in caloric intake initiates a “tug of war” between peripheral “anabolic signals” (19Kersten S.

Med. 2003; 9: 756-761Google Scholar), within the hypothalamus initiate a negative feedback, which includes restraint on food intake, stimulation of energy expenditure, and decreased output of nutrients from endogenous sources (mainly from the liver). Animals and humans may be susceptible to weight gain and altered metabolic regulation when this negative feedback is disrupted. The rapid onset of leptin resistance in rodent models of voluntary overfeeding provides initial support for this theory (34Halaas J.L. Boozer C. Blair-West J. Fidahusein N. Denton D.A. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8878-8883Google Scholar, 35Widdowson P.S. Upton R. Buckingham R. Arch J. Williams G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1782-1785Google Scholar). Here we test the hypothesis that short term increase in caloric intake rapidly induces resistance to the central effects of the long-chain fatty acid, oleic acid (OA). Thus, we examined whether changes in nutritional status lead to alterations in the central effects of OA on feeding behavior and glucose production. Animals and Experimental Design—Ten-week-old male Sprague-Dawley or Zucker Fatty rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were housed in individual cages and subjected to a standard light dark cycle (0600–1800/1800–0600). At 14 days before the in vivo studies, all rats received implantations of ICV catheters by stereotaxic surgery as described previously (36Liu L. Karkanias G.B. Morales J.C. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Wang J. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31160-31167Google Scholar). Rats were allowed to recover completely before initiation of all in vivo studies. Animals were fed a standard chow (SC, catalog number 5001, Purina Mills Ltd., with 59% calories provided by carbohydrate, 28% by protein, and 12% by fat, 3.3 kcal/g), a high sucrose (HS; animals were given free access to a 20% sucrose solution in addition to their standard chow diet), or a highly palatable high fat diet (HF, catalog number 9389; Purina Mills Ltd., with 45% calories provided by carbohydrate, 22% by protein and 33% by fat, 5.32 kcal/g) that was generated by supplementing SC diet with 10% lard. The lard contained 2% myristic acid, 24% palmitic acid, 13% stearic acid, 46% oleic acid, and 12% linoleic acid. The total composition of fats in the HF diet was 5.2% saturated, 6.2% monounsaturated, and 2.7% polyunsaturated fat by weight. The SC diet contained 1, 1.5, and 1.6% of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats by weight, respectively. Five groups of animals were included in the feeding and metabolic studies (described below) after 3 days on the following diet regimens (Table I): 1) SC ad libitum (SC; ∼80 kcal/day); 2) HS ad libitum (HS; ∼95 kcal/day); 3) HF ad libitum (HF140; ∼140 kcal/day); 4) HF calorie-restricted (HF55; ∼55 kcal/day); and 5) HF pair-fed to SC (HF80; ∼80 kcal/day). In addition, we performed metabolic studies on Zucker Fatty rats (n = 10) fed an SC diet.Table IMetabolic and hormonal profiles for each treatment groupTreatmentHF55 vehicle, 9OA, 7HF80 vehicle, 4OA, 5HF140 vehicle 7OA(30 nmol), 6OA (300 nmol), 5BasalFood intake (kcal/day)55558080143 ± 6137 ± 6150 ± 4Body weight (g)293 ± 10295 ± 6303 ± 3307 ± 4313 ± 10312 ± 12301 ± 9Δ body weight (g)-8 ± 6-15 ± 3-2 ± 11-3 ± 817 ± 6ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.13 ± 4ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.11 ± 3ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.Glucose (mmol/liter)7.4 ± 0.27.4 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.17.2 ± 0.37.6 ± 0.27.4 ± 0.17.4 ± 0.2Insulin (ng/ml)0.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.1.7 ± 0.4ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.1.8 ± 0.4ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.Leptin (ng/ml)1.2 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.4ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.1.8 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.2.0 ± 0.3ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.FFA (mmol/liter)0.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1Adiponectin (μg/ml)4.0 ± 0.83.6 ± 0.53.0 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.43.5 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.5ClampGlucose (mmol/liter)7.5 ± 0.27.3 ± 0.37.8 ± 0.17.1 ± 0.37.0 ± 0.47.5 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.3Insulin (ng/ml)0.8 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.1Leptin (ng/ml)1.0 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.4ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.1.6 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.1.9 ± 0.4ap < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80.FFA (mmol/liter)0.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1a p < 0.01 versus HF55 or HF80. Open table in a new tab Central Delivery of OA—OA was complexed with the polymer hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPB, Cyclodextrin Technologies Development Inc.). The latter has been shown to provide an excellent vehicle for the central delivery of fatty acids (23Obici S. Feng Z. Morgan K. Stein D. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 271-275Google Scholar, 37Yaksh T.L. Jang J.D. Nishiuchi Y. Braun K.P. Ro S.G. Goodman M. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 623-633Google Scholar, 38Pitha J. Gerloczy A. Olivi A. J. Pharm. Sci. 1994; 83: 833-837Google Scholar). OA was solubilized in 45% HPB to a final concentration of 17 mm. The HPB-OA solution was diluted in artificial cerebrospinal fluid to the appropriate concentration used for each ICV injection (30 or 300 nmol/5 μl). HPB alone at a similar concentration as in the OA studies was used in all vehicle control studies. Feeding Behavior Studies—This experimental protocol was designed to examine the acute effect of ICV OA on food intake in three experimental groups fed a standard chow (SC), a high sucrose diet (HS95), and a high fat diet (HF140). SC and HF140 animals were allowed to eat their diets ad libitum. HS animals were given free access to a 20% sucrose solution in addition to the standard chow diet for 3 days. Following 3 days of ad libitum feeding in all groups, on study day 0 (Fig. 1A), rats were given an ICV bolus injection of either 5 μl of OA (30 nmol) or vehicle at a rate of 1 μl/min using a gas-tight syringe (Hamilton Corp.) 1 h before the start of the dark cycle. Food intake was measured at the same time daily for 3 days post-injection. NPY Expression Studies—For analysis of NPY expression, we studied two groups of rats, HF55 and HF140. After 3 days on the respective diet regimen, ICV vehicle (10% HPB in artificial cerebrospinal fluid) or ICV OA (30 nmol) was injected as a bolus into the third cerebral ventricle 1 h before the start of the dark cycle. Food was withdrawn, and hypothalami were harvested 16 h following injection. Insulin Action Studies—The experimental protocol herein was designed to examine the effect of nutritional status on the ability of long-chain fatty acids in the hypothalamus to modulate carbohydrate metabolism. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 43) and Zucker Fatty rats (n = 10) were implanted with chronic catheters as described previously (36Liu L. Karkanias G.B. Morales J.C. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Wang J. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31160-31167Google Scholar). After full recovery from the catheterization, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups HF55 (n = 16), HF80 (n = 9), or HF140 (n = 18) and were allowed to consume their allocated diet for 3 days. On the night prior to the in vivo study, all rats received 55 kcal to ensure a similar nutritional state at the start of the metabolic studies. In a separate experiment, Zucker Fatty rats (n = 10) were fed a standard chow diet and allowed to fast for 5 h prior to the metabolic studies. All studies were performed in awake, unstressed, chronically catheterized rats. At t = 0 (Fig. 3A), a primed continuous infusion of ICV OA (total dose 30 or 300 nmol) or vehicle (HBP 10% in artificial cerebrospinal fluid) was initiated and maintained throughout the duration of the study. Plasma glucose was measured periodically initiating at the onset (t = 0) of the ICV infusion and lasting throughout the duration of the study. Plasma samples for determination of insulin, leptin, and nonesterified fatty acid concentration were obtained at the onset (t = 0) and at 30-min intervals during the study. At t = 120, a primed continuous infusion of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified [3-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 40 μCi bolus, 0.4 μCi/min for duration of the study) was initiated and maintained for the last 4 h of the study. Samples for determination of [3H]glucose-specific activity were obtained at 10-min intervals throughout infusions. Finally, at t = 240, a pancreatic insulin clamp study was initiated and maintained for 2 h. During this procedure, a primed continuous infusion of regular insulin (1 milliunit/kg/min) was administered, and a variable infusion of 25% glucose solution was started at t = 240 and periodically adjusted to clamp the plasma glucose concentration at ∼7 mm. The rate of insulin infusion was designed to replace the plasma insulin concentration at approximately the average basal levels in post-absorptive rats. In order to control for possible effects of the ICV injections on endocrine pancreas, somatostatin (3 μg/kg/min) was co-infused with insulin to inhibit endogenous insulin secretion. At the end of the in vivo studies, rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital 55 mg/kg body weight, intravenously), and tissue samples were freeze-clamped in situ with aluminum tongs pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. All tissue samples were stored at –80 °C for subsequent analysis. Analytical Procedures and Calculations—Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Plasma insulin and leptin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (rat leptin radioimmunoassay kit, Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO). Serum adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, Inc.). Plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were determined by following an enzymatic method using an automated kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (Waco Pure Chemical Industries. Osaka, Japan). The radioactivity of [3-3H]glucose in plasma was measured from supernatants of Ba (OH)2 and from ZnSO4 precipitates (Somogyi procedure) after each sample was evaporated to dryness for the removal of tritiated water. Hepatic uridine diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) concentrations and specific activities were obtained by two sequential chromatographic separations, as described previously (39Giaccari A. Rossetti L.

Calculations were performed as described previously (43Barzilai N. Wang J. Massilon D. Vuguin P. Hawkins M. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 3105-3110Google Scholar). Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from hypothalami and liver with Trizol (Invitrogen). NPY, Glc-6-Pase, or PEPCK expression was measured by Northern blot analysis. Hypothalamic RNA was analyzed using probes for prepro-NPY and β-actin. To assess the effect of ICV OA on the expression of hepatic enzymes, total RNA was isolated from freeze-clamped liver tissues from rats subjected to insulin clamp studies. Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK cDNA were obtained as described previously (44Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1875-1881Google Scholar, 45Massillon D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 228-234Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using a random primer kit (Stratagene). Quantification was performed by scanning densitometry, normalizing for β-actin signal and 18 S ribosomal RNA to correct for loading variabilities. Agouti-related protein (AGRP) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expressions were measured by quantitative PCR. Single-stranded cDNA synthesis and real time PCRs with hypothalamic total RNA were performed as described before (25Obici S. Feng Z. Karkanias G. Baskin D.G. Rossetti L. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 566-572Google Scholar). The following primers were used for the quantitative PCR: agouti-related protein, forward, 5′-GCCATGCTGACTGCAATGTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGCTAGGTGCGACTACAGA-3′; proopiomelanocortin, forward, 5′-CCAGGCAACGGAGATGAAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCACTGGCCCTTCTTGTGC-3′; and β-actin, forward, 5′-TGAGACCTTCAACACCCCAGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAGTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGAG-3′. The copy number of each transcript was measured against a copy number standard curve of cloned target templates. Expression of each transcript was normalized to the copy number for β-actin. Normalization with the glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase copy number yielded similar results (data not shown). Comparisons between groups were made by analysis of variance, and all values are presented as the mean ± S.E. Specifically, for the feeding data presented in Fig. 1, the two curves for vehicle and oleic acid were first compared with each other by using analysis of variance for repeated measures. If statistical differences were revealed, the differences between each time point were estimated using Student's t test. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. To induce voluntary hyperphagia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a highly palatable diet, ad libitum, for 3 days (Table I). Their food intake and adaptation to the increased caloric content of the diet was monitored daily. Despite hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia, animals in this group failed to adapt to the enhanced caloric content of the diet and increased their daily energy intake by ∼70–140 kcal/day. Because control rats undergoing the same experimental procedures consumed ∼80 kcal/day when exposed to standard chow, we also compared the ad libitum fed rats to a group of pair-fed rats receiving 80 kcal/day and to a group of calorie-restricted rats receiving 55 kcal/day of the same highly palatable diet. This approach allowed us to investigate the central effects of OA at three levels of daily caloric intake reflecting moderate caloric restriction, pair-feeding, and overfeeding. It should be noted that data reported below for the pair-fed group are quite similar to those obtained in rats fed standard chow (23Obici S. Feng Z. Morgan K. Stein D. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 271-275Google Scholar). Thus, this experimental approach allowed us to examine whether the central effects of OA on food intake and insulin action are modulated by short term changes in caloric intake. Voluntary Overfeeding Rapidly Curtails the Effects of Central OA on Feeding Behavior and Hypothalamic NPY and AGRP Expression—We examined whether ICV OA modulates feeding behavior in animals following 3 days of voluntary overfeeding. Food intake was monitored daily in animals fed ad libitum either a high palatable diet (HF140) to induce hyperphagia or a standard chow (SC; caloric intake 78 ± 3 kcal/day) diet for 3 days prior to ICV injections. To examine the effects of macronutrient composition of the diet (e.g. high fat versus high carbohydrate) on OA sensitivity, we also studied an additional group of animals that were allowed free access to a 20% sucrose solution in addition to their standard chow (HS; caloric intake of 93 ± 4 kcal/day, reflecting an increased total caloric intake of ∼20% compared with SC animals). After 3 days on their assigned regimen, all animals received a bolus of either OA (30 nmol) or vehicle (HPB) via an indwelling ICV catheter 1 h prior to the onset of the dark cycle. Food intake was monitored for a total of 3 days following ICV injections (Fig. 1A), and the effects of OA were compared with those elicited by vehicle alone within each experimental group. ICV OA resulted in a 48 and 52% decrease in food intake compared with pre-injection basal levels when administered to SC animals (Fig. 1, B and E) on the 1st and 2nd day following the ICV injection, respectively. However, after 3 days of moderate overfeeding (HS95) ICV OA decreased daily food intake by 21% on the 1st day and by 17% on the 2nd day (Fig. 1, D and E). Finally, following 3 days of marked voluntary hyperphagia (HF140), ICV OA decreased daily food intake by only 11% on the 1st day and by –2% on the 2nd day (Fig. 1, C and E). The modest decreases observed in the HS95 and HF140 groups were not statistically different from those observed after ICV injection of vehicle alone (Fig. 1, C and D). All groups returned to base-line food intake 3 days after the OA injection (Fig. 1, B–E). We next examined a potential mechanism by which resistance to hypothalamic OA may develop. We reported previously that hypothalamic NPY mRNA was decreased (by ∼50%) after ICV OA compared with ICV vehicle in rats fed standard chow following prolonged (16 h) fasting (23Obici S. Feng Z. Morgan K. Stein D. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 271-275Google Scholar). Here we asked whether changes in the nutritional status modulate the ability of ICV OA to restrain the hypothalamic expression of NPY. To this end, we assessed the abundance of NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus by Northern blot analysis following 3 days of ad libitum feeding (∼140 kcal/day) on a highly palatable diet or restricted to 55 kcal/day on the same diet. Both experimental groups were given a single bolus injection of 30 nmol of OA or vehicle (HPB) followed by an overnight fast. Hypothalamic tissue was harvested the following morning, and Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig. 2A). Quantification by densitometry, utilizing β-actin as a reference transcript, demonstrated that the average NPY mRNA levels were similar in HF55 and HF140 (Fig. 2C). ICV OA suppressed NPY mRNA expression in the 55-kcal/day group by ∼60% (Fig. 2D). This decrease is similar to that reported previously (23Obici S. Feng Z. Morgan K. Stein D. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 271-275Google Scholar) in rats fed standard chow at ∼70 kcal/day following prolonged fasting. However, ICV OA decreased hypothalamic NPY mRNA by only 28% in fasted animals following 3 days of voluntary overfeeding (Fig. 2, C and D). These data provide evidence that the hyperphagia displayed in animals given free access to a highly palatable diet is partly due to defective regulation of NPY expression in the hypothalamus. To investigate further the potential mechanisms responsible for the OA resistance, we next analyzed the effect of OA on the gene expression of the hypothalamic neuropeptides, agouti-related protein (AGRP) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Total hypothalami were obtained from ICV vehicle (n = 9) or ICV OA (n = 8) administered animals that were fed either 55 or 140 kcal/day for 3 days. Quantitative analysis of hypothalamic RNA demonstrated that OA suppressed AGRP expression by ∼75% in animals fed 55 kcal/day as compared with vehicle (Fig. 2D). Conversely, animals fed 140 kcal/day failed to suppress AGRP expression when treated with ICV OA. In fact, the expression of AGRP was ∼120% of its level in ICV vehicle-infused animals (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, hypothalamic POMC expression was not altered following ICV OA treatment (Fig. 2E). Thus, 140 kcal/day animals displayed marked resistance to the ability of OA to alter AGRP expression in the hypothalamus, and this may partially account for the hyperphagia displayed by these animals. Voluntary Overfeeding Rapidly Blunts the Effects of Central OA on Insulin Action and Hepatic Glucose Production—We next examined whether short term changes in nutritional status were sufficient to alter the effect of OA on in vivo insulin action (Fig. 3A). The effect of ICV OA on insulin action was assessed in conscious rats using a combination of ICV infusions and pancreatic insulin clamp studies (Fig. 3B) The three experimental groups (HF55, HF80, and HF140) were randomized to receive either ICV OA or vehicle (HPB) treatment (Table I and Fig. 3B). The basal plasma FFA and glucose concentrations were similar in all groups (Table I). On the day prior to pancreatic-euglycemic clamp studies, all rats received the same amount of calories (55 kcal) to ensure similar post-absorptive states prior to metabolic measurements (Fig. 3A). In the presence of ICV vehicle and near basal levels of circulating insulin, marginal rates of glucose infusion (GIR) were required to maintain euglycemia in the three experimental groups (HF55–2.4, HF80–1.2, and HF140–1.4 mg/kg/min) (Fig. 3C). In contrast, in both the HF55 and HF80 groups, following the ICV infusion of OA (30 nmol), the GIR required to maintain euglycemia was markedly increased (9.55 and 4.64 mg/kg/min, respectively). However, ICV infusion of the same dose of OA failed to increase GIR in the ad libitum fed group. In fact, even the infusion of a 10-fold higher dose of OA (300 nmol) did not significantly increase GIR in this group (Fig. 3C). Because the stimulatory effect of ICV OA on GIR was significantly (∼2-fold) higher in the HF55 than in the HF80 group, this increase appears to be highly dependent on the preceding nutritional status of the animal even within the normal to low range of caloric intake. Plasma FFA concentrations did not change during the clamp period (Table I) indicating that the metabolic effects induced by ICV OA were initiated by its action within the central nervous system. The increased requirement for exogenous glucose elicited by the ICV administration of OA in the presence of basal insulin levels could be due to stimulation of glucose uptake and/or to suppression of endogenous glucose production (GP). However, the rates of glucose disappearance (Fig. 3D, Rd) were similar in the three experimental groups, and most important, ICV OA did not significantly modify them. Thus, the increase in whole body insulin action induced by ICV OA in the HF55 and HF80 groups did not reflect an increase in peripheral glucose uptake (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, ICV OA (at 30 nmol) markedly inhibite"

Kir channels are expressed in many tissues and serve important roles in cellular physiology such as cell excitability, K+ homeostasis, and insulin secretion. The activity of Kir channels is regulated by many intracellular factors and second messengers (1Ruppersberg J.P. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 441: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

A common feature of Kir channels that has emerged recently is that they all require the membrane phospholipid, PIP2 to maintain their activity (6Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl.

PIP2, although only a minor component of the plasma membrane phospholipids, plays an important role in cell signaling; PIP2 serves as the substrate for PLC (phospholipase C)-mediated hydrolysis into the two ubiquitous second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate. Recent studies have suggested that PIP2 directly mediates receptor-induced modulation of Kir channel activity (14Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat.

The molecular mechanism by which Kir channels are regulated as a consequence of stimulation of different PLC isoforms, such as PLCβ coupled to receptor signaling through Gq- or PLCγ-coupled to tyrosine kinase receptors, remains unsettled.

It is generally believed that intracellular pH inhibits Kir channels through protonation of certain amino acid residues within the cytosolic channel domains (25Fakler B. Schultz J. Yang J. Schulte U.

However, a mechanism other than mere protonation is needed to explain pH inhibition of Kir channels (26Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B.

Recent studies indicate that PIP2 also plays an important role in the pH-induced inhibition of Kir channels (29Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.L. J. Biol.

In the present study, we aimed to explore the hypothesis that channel-PIP2 interactions determine modulation of Kir channel activity by multiple regulatory factors. We predominantly used two members of the Kir2 family, Kir2.1 (IRK1) and Kir2.3 (IRK3), and their mutants to show that the strength of channel-PIP2 interactions determines the degree of inhibition of these Kir2 channels by receptor (M1 and EGFR) stimulation, PKC activation (via PMA treatment), intracellular Mg2+ and pH. Our results strongly suggest that the apparent affinity of channel-PIP2 interactions is a key element in determining modulation of Kir channels. Molecular Biology—All cDNA constructs were subcloned into the pGEMHE plasmid vector and used as described. Point mutants were produced by Pfu mutagenesis with a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant Kir channels, M1 and EGF receptors were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes as previously described (35Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). cRNA was produced with T7 RNA polymerase using a kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). cRNA of the various Kir channels and their mutants and of receptors was injected in the range of 0.5–10 ng/oocyte depending on the functional expression level of the given construct. Electrophysiology—Recordings in X. laevis oocytes were performed 2–4 days following cRNA injection. Whole oocyte currents were measured by conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl dissolved in 1% agarose to prevent the leakage of KCl into the oocytes. The electrodes had a resistance less than 1 mΩ. Oocytes were constantly perfused with a high potassium solution (ND96K) containing (in mm) 96 KCl, 1 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). A low potassium solution (ND96) was used in some experiments to inhibit most of the Kir currents at –80 mV. ND96 contained (in mm) 96 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). Current amplitudes were measured at +80 mV and –80 mV. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using pClamp8 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 6 (Microcal) software. Macropatch channel activity was recorded from devitellinized oocytes under the inside-out mode of standard patch clamp methods using an EPC-9 or EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier and PULSE/PULSEFIT (version 7.6 or 8.5) data acquisition software (Heka Electronik, Germany). Electrodes were made from borosilicate glass (WPI) using a Sutter P-97 microelectrode puller and gave a tip diameter of 5–15 μm that had a resistance of 0.5–1MΩ when filled with an electrode solution containing (in mm) 96 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). Three bath solutions were used: 1) an ATP-containing solution (in mm): 96 KCl, 5 EGTA, 1 MgATP and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4); 2) a FVPP solution (in mm): 96 KCl, 5 EDTA, 10 HEPES, 5 NaF, 3 Na3VO4, 10 Na2PO7 (pH 7.4) to prevent current rundown (10Huang C.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); and 3) a ND96K solution (in mm): 96 KCl, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Current amplitudes were measured at –80 mV with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. Data were analyzed using PULSEFIT and Origin software. Kinetics of inhibition by PIP2 antibody or polylysine have been previously justified as reliable measures of channel-PIP2 interactions and were used as previously described (13Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Chemicals—PIP2 was purchased from Roche Applied Science and Roche Diagnostics; DiC8 PIP2 was purchased from Echelon. PIP2 antibody was purchased from Assay Technologies (Ann Arbor, MI). PIP2 and PIP2 antibody were prepared as described previously (12Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 13Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E.

Each experiment shown or described was performed on 3–5 oocytes of the same batch. A minimum of 2–3 batches of oocytes was tested for each experiment shown. The unpaired t test was used to assess statistical significance in all cases where indicated. Activation of M1 and EGF Receptors Inhibits Kir2.3 Channel but Not Kir2.1 Channel Currents—We chose the Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels as representatives to study Kir channel modulation. These two channels serve as good examples, because they have been shown to be modulated distinctly by M1 activation (24Chuang H.H. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), PKC (32Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Zhu G. Qu Z. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and pH (28Qu Z. Yang Z. Cui N. Zhu G. Liu C. Xu H. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Wu J. Li Y. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31573-31580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), even though they belong to the same subfamily of Kir channels. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, both Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels gave substantial inwardly rectifying currents. Fig. 1, A and B, shows the current traces recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp at +80 (above the dotted zero current line) and –80 mV (below the dotted zero current line) in a high extracellular K+ bath solution (ND96K). When M1 muscarinic receptors were coexpressed with these Kir channels and were stimulated by acetylcholine (ACh, 5 μm), Kir2.3 currents were consistently inhibited, whereas Kir2.1 currents were not (Fig. 1, A–C). Transient Ca2+-activated Cl– currents seen at +80 mV were indicative of PIP2 hydrolysis by PLC, which is known to be coupled to M1 receptor signaling (e.g. Ref. 14Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Full recovery of Kir2.3 currents from inhibition could be obtained following long term washout of ACh (data not shown). We investigated whether PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 through a G protein-independent pathway would also result in Kir2.3 inhibition. In addition, we tested whether G protein-dependent and -independent pathways of PIP2 hydrolysis were occlusive of each other in inhibiting K+ currents. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) hydrolyzes PIP2 via direct coupling to PLCγ. Kir2.3 channel, M1, and EGF receptors were coexpressed in oocytes and ACh (5 μm) and EGF (100 ng/ml) were applied through the bath solution. EGF induced a similar inhibition of Kir2.3 currents as ACh, and the inhibition of Kir2.3 by ACh or EGF was occlusive for the other agent (Fig. 1, D–F). EGF has been shown not to induce a significant inhibition of Kir2.1 currents (14Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, two independent pathways that hydrolyze PIP2 showed similar effects on Kir2.3 and Kir2.1 channels. Moreover, each pathway occluded the effect of the other in inhibiting Kir2.3 currents. ACh- and EGF-induced Inhibition of Kir Currents Shows a Strong Correlation to the Apparent Affinity of Interaction with PIP2—We have previously identified mutations that alter channel-PIP2 interactions (e.g. Ref. 12Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar and 13Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We first used PIP2 antibody to functionally assess channel-PIP2 interactions (10Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 12Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the current traces recorded from inside-out macropatches held at –80 mV. PIP2 antibody inhibited Kir2.3 significantly faster than Kir2.1 currents, suggesting that Kir2.1 channels interact tighter with PIP2 than Kir2.3 channels do. We previously identified an amino acid difference between Kir3.4* and Kir2.1 channels, which is critical for interactions with PIP2 (12Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Mutation of isoleucine in Kir3.4*(Ile229) to the corresponding Kir2.1 leucine (Leu222) strengthened interactions of Kir3.4* with PIP2. Kir2.3 channels also have an isoleucine (Ile213) in the position corresponding to GIRK4 (Ile229). We made the point mutation of Kir2.3 (I213L) and tested the kinetics of inhibition by PIP2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, Kir2.3 (I213L) significantly slowed the time course of inhibition by PIP2 antibody. In addition, the point mutant Kir2.1(R312Q) was inhibited by PIP2 antibody with much faster kinetics than control (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous results (13Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Summary data in Fig. 2B show the time needed for PIP2 antibody to inhibit half the channel currents. Thus, Kir2.3(I213L) behaved similarly to Kir3.4(I229L) in showing slower kinetics of PIP2 antibody inhibition of these mutant currents compared with control. In fact, there is good correlation of the residue type at this position (Fig. 2C, highlighted) with the strength of interaction of PIP2 with Kir channels: channels possessing a Leu residue generally show stronger interactions with PIP2 than channels possessing an Ile residue at this position (see Fig. 4C and “Discussion”). We proceeded to test whether this mutation caused an increase in the apparent affinity of Kir2.3 to PIP2. We used the 8-carbon long acyl chains on PIP2 (DiC8), a synthetic water soluble analog of PIP2, to construct dose-response curves of PIP2 on channel activity. Shifts in the PIP2 dose-response curves for Kir currents with specific mutations affecting channel-PIP2 interactions have previously suggested changes in the channel-PIP2 apparent affinity (13Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Consistent with the PIP2 antibody results (i.e. strength of interactions of Kir2.1 > Kir2.3(I213L) > Kir2.3) (Fig. 2D), the relative apparent affinities of these channels for PIP2 were in the same order (Kir2.1:EC50 ∼5 μm > Kir2.3(I213L):EC50 ∼8 μm > Kir2.3:EC50 ∼29 μm). Given these results we will use interchangeably the terms “strength” of channel-PIP2 interactions or “apparent affinity” of a channel to PIP2. We next proceeded to test whether these mutations that altered channel-PIP2 interaction also affected modulation of Kir2.3 and Kir 2.1 currents by M1 and EGFR stimulation. Fig. 2, E and F, shows that Kir2.3(I213L) was inhibited significantly less than Kir2.3 by either M1 or EGFR stimulation, whereas Kir2.1(R312Q) showed greater inhibition than Kir2.1 by M1 and EGFR stimulation. Therefore, we conclude that the extent of agonist-induced current inhibition of these Kir channels is controlled by the apparent affinity of interactions between the channels and PIP2. PMA- and ACh-induced Inhibitions of Kir Currents Show a Strong Correlation with the Apparent Affinity of a Channel to PIP2—Previous studies have shown that Kir2.3 channels are inhibited by PMA through PKC-mediated phosphorylation (32Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Zhu G. Qu Z. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11643-11646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, Kir2.1 channels are generally not modulated by PKC activation. We performed similar experiments to those described above using PMA-modulated Kir channels expressed in oocytes. When PMA (100 nm) was applied to oocytes expressing Kir2.3 channels, currents were inhibited irreversibly; the inhibition started with a delay of ∼2 min and reached a plateau 4–5 min following PMA application (Fig. 3A); Kir2.3 currents were inhibited to about 50% of their original amplitude (Fig. 3E) and no further inhibition was observed after PMA concentration was increased from 100 nm to 1 μm; the inactive form of PMA, 4-α-PMA, had no effect on Kir2.3 currents (data not shown); a specific PKC blocker, bisindoylmaleimide, prevented PMA-induced inhibition of Kir2.3 currents (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that PMA inhibited Kir2.3 currents through a PKC-mediated mechanism. In contrast, PMA did not inhibit significantly Kir2.1 currents (Fig. 3, B and E). Kir2.3(I213L), which increased the apparent affinity of interactions with PIP2, completely abolished PMA-induced inhibition (Fig. 3, C and E). In contrast, Kir2.1(R312Q), which showed decreased affinity of interactions with PIP2, did exhibit inhibition by PMA (Fig. 3, D and E). Thus, apparent affinity of channel-PIP2 interactions determines modulation of these Kir channels by PMA. To further examine the generality of our conclusion, we tested for ACh- and PMA-induced inhibition in the presence and absence of Gβγ. Activation of Kir3.4* channels by Gβγ (10Huang C.L. Feng S.

Physiol. 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) constitutes a physiological way by which channel-PIP2 interactions can be strengthened. Fig. 3 also shows that basal Kir3.4 currents could be inhibited by either ACh or PMA treatment (Fig. 3F). Coexpression of Kir3.4* channels with Gβγ greatly reduced the ACh- or PMA-induced current inhibition (Fig. 3G). These results further support the conclusion that the strength of channel-PIP2 interactions determines modulation of Kir channels by ACh and PMA. We next examined the ACh-(Fig. 4A) and PMA-induced (Fig. 4B) inhibition of most Kir channel family members. We correlated these effects to the strength of interaction with PIP2 exhibited by each of these channels (Fig. 4C), as assessed by polylysine block kinetics (see Ref. 13Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). So far, three Kir channels have not yielded homomeric currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (e.g. Kir3.1, Kir5.1 and Kir6.1, or Kir6.1Δ 36). Mutants of Kir3 family members have been shown to exhibit large homomeric currents (Kir3.1-F137S and Kir3.4-S143T) (35Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Heteromeric expression often also enhances channel targeting to the cell surface and yields larger currents than the corresponding homomeric ones (e.g. Kir3.1/3.4 and Kir4.1/5.1). We studied 11 homomeric and two heteromeric channels (Fig. 4). Based on our results, we ranked strength of channel-PIP2 interactions relative to the strongest interacting channel Kir4.1. This analysis indicated the following rank order among Kir channel subfamilies (from the strongest to the weakest PIP2 interacting): Kir4 > Kir1 ∼ Kir2 > Kir6 > Kir7 ∼ Kir3 (Fig. 4C). Both the ACh- and PMA-induced effects showed an almost perfect inverse correlation to the strength of channel-PIP2 interactions (Fig. 4, A and B). The only exception seemed to be Kir2.2, which displayed relatively strong channel-PIP2 interactions with disproportionately large ACh and PMA current inhibition. These results suggest that the strength of channel-PIP2 interactions determines modulation of Kir channels through agonist- and PMA-induced effects. Enhanced Channel-PIP2 Interaction and PIP2 Prevent Intracellular Mg2+ Inhibition of Kir2.3 Channels—Intracellular Mg2+ was shown previously to inhibit Kir2.3 channel currents, and was suggested to act as a second messenger accounting directly for the M1-induced inhibition of Kir2.3 channels (24Chuang H.H. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study we tested whether the Mg2+-induced inhibition of Kir2.3 currents was PIP2-dependent. Data shown in Fig. 5 were obtained from inside-out macropatches. Kir2.3 as well as Kir2.1 channels generally gave currents in the nanoampere range when recorded in the cell-attached mode at –80 mV (e.g.Fig. 5A). When an inside-out patch was excised into a Mg2+-free high K+ solution (ND96K), Kir2.3 currents ran up first, reaching a plateau that was maintained for a short time before starting to run down. Kir2.3 currents were more stable in a FVPP solution, which inhibits phosphatases and thus prevents breakdown of PIP2 (10Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, 1 mm Mg2+ significantly accelerated rundown of Kir2.3 currents when applied to the inner surface of inside-out patches. Only a small portion of the rundown currents could be recovered after Mg2+ was washed away (Fig. 5A). However, the time course of Kir2.3 current rundown was variable from patch to patch, possibly reflecting variable phosphatase activities. PIP2 (10 μm), applied to the inner surface of patches, could activate Kir2.3 currents after they completely ran down; normally long PIP2 applications were required to reactivate Kir2.3 channels, possibly because of the slow diffusion of exogenous PIP2 into the membranes and binding to the channels. Once Kir2.3 channels were reactivated by PIP2, Mg2+ could not induce current rundown any more. Instead, Mg2+ application following reactivation by PIP2 induced a nonspecific reversible inhibition. Kir2.3(I213L) currents were less sensitive to Mg2+ inhibition. Fig. 5B shows that each application of Mg2+ accelerated current rundown but the Mg2+-induced rundown was much slower for Kir2.3(I213L) than the Kir2.3 control. After rundown, PIP2 activated Kir2.3(I213L) faster than Kir2.3 currents, suggesting a stronger binding affinity of Kir2.3(I213L) channels to PIP2; Mg2+ again could not significantly inhibit Kir2.3(I213L) currents after they were reactivated by PIP2. In previous work (24Chuang H.H. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Kir2.1 channels were assessed to be Mg2+-insensitive. In our experiments, we found Mg2+ able to induce Kir2.1 current rundown, albeit with much slower kinetics (Fig. 5C). PIP2 reactivated Kir2.1 currents following run-down with fast kinetics, and Mg2+ induced a small, reversible inhibition of the currents that was comparable with the inhibition of Kir2.3 or Kir2.3(I213L) currents following PIP2 reactivation. Fig. 5D shows that the Mg2+-induced rundown was much faster for Kir2.1(R312Q) than for Kir2.1 wild type. After run-down, PIP2 reactivated Kir2.1(R312Q) slower than Kir2.1 currents, suggesting a weaker binding affinity for Kir2.1(R312Q) than for Kir2.1. Once again, Mg2+ induced only a PIP2-independent inhibition following reactivation by PIP2. Fig. 5E shows summary data of the inhibition of Kir2.3, Kir2.3(I213L), Kir2.1, and Kir2.1(R312Q) by Mg2+ before and after application"

We have analyzed the early dynamics of myoblasts implanted into the myocardium and investigated the mechanisms underlying graft attrition. At 10 min after implantation of [14C]thymidine-labeled male myoblasts into female mice hearts, 14C measurement showed that 39.2 +/- 3.0% of the grafted cells survived, and this steadily decreased to 16.0 +/- 1.7% by 24 h and to 7.4 +/- 0.9% by 72 h. PCR of male-specific Smcy gene calculated that the total (surviving plus proliferated) number of donor-derived cells was 18.3 +/- 1.6 and 23.3 +/- 1.3% at 24 and 72 h, respectively, indicating that proliferation of the surviving cells began after 24 h. Acute inflammation became prominent by 24 h and was reduced by 72 h as indicated by myeloperoxidase activity and histological findings. Multiplex RT-PCR revealed corresponding changes in IL-1beta, TGF-beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression. Treatment with CuZn-superoxide dismutase attenuated the initial rapid death and resulted in enhanced cell numbers afterward, giving a twofold increased total number at 72 h compared with the nontreatment. This effect was associated with reduced inflammatory response, suggesting a causative role for superoxide in the initial rapid graft death and subsequent inflammation. These data describe the early dynamics of myoblasts implanted into the myocardium and suggest that initial oxidative stress and following inflammatory response may be important mechanisms contributing to acute graft attrition, both of which could be potential therapeutic targets to improve the efficiency of cell transplantation to the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2074566613,"Dpo4 and Dbh are Y-family polymerases that originate from two closely related strains of Sulfolobaceae. Quite surprisingly, however, the two polymerases exhibit different enzymatic properties in vitro. For example, Dpo4 can replicate past a variety of DNA lesions, yet Dbh does so with a much lower efficiency. When replicating undamaged DNA, Dpo4 is prone to make base pair substitutions, whereas Dbh predominantly makes single-base deletions. Overall, the two proteins are 54% identical, but the greatest divergence is found in their respective little finger (LF) domains, which are only 41% identical. To investigate the role of the LF domain in the fidelity and lesion-bypassing abilities of Y-family polymerases, we have generated chimeras of Dpo4 and Dbh in which their LF domains have been interchanged. Interestingly, by replacing the LF domain of Dbh with that of Dpo4, the enzymatic properties of the chimeric enzyme are more Dpo4-like in that the enzyme is more processive, can bypass an abasic site and a thymine-thymine cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, and predominantly makes base pair substitutions when replicating undamaged DNA. The converse is true for the Dpo4-LF-Dbh chimera, which is more Dbh-like in its processivity and ability to bypass DNA adducts and generate single-base deletion errors. Our studies indicate that the unique but variable LF domain of Y-family polymerases plays a major role in determining the enzymatic and biological properties of each individual Y-family member.

Our studies indicate that the unique but variable LF domain of Y-family polymerases plays a major role in determining the enzymatic and biological properties of each individual Y-family member. Remarkable progress has been made in the past few years in understanding the molecular mechanisms of damage-induced mutagenesis. It has been suggested that a significant proportion of mutations arises when damaged genomic DNA is replicated in an error prone manner by one or more low fidelity polymerases (1Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Google Scholar). These polymerases appear to have evolved to specifically facilitate replication of a wide variety of DNA lesions that might otherwise block the high fidelity replication machinery. Most of these specialized polymerases are phylogenetically related to each other and have been collectively termed “Y-family” polymerases (2Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Google Scholar). The Y-family polymerases are ubiquitous and are found in all three kingdoms of life with many organisms often possessing more than one family member. The latter observations imply that Y-family polymerases play important roles in cellular survival or evolutionary “fitness” (3Friedberg E.C. Wagner R. Radman M. Science. 2002; 296: 1627-1630Google Scholar, 4Yeiser B. Pepper E.D. Goodman M.F. Finkel S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8737-8741Google Scholar).

Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Google Scholar), whereas mutations in Escherichia coli dinB reduce the ability of the cell to undergo adaptive mutagenesis in stationary phase (7McKenzie G.J. Lee P.L. Lombardo M.J. Hastings P.J. Rosenberg S.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 571-579Google Scholar, 8Tompkins J.D. Nelson J.L. Hazel J.C. Leugers S.L. Stumpf J.D. Foster P.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3469-3472Google Scholar). Although they share little primary amino acid sequence homology with DNA polymerases from other families, structural studies of two archaeal DinB-like polymerases (Dbh and Dpo4) and the catalytic core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Polη reveal that they are topologically similar to classical polymerases in that they resemble a right hand and possess “fingers,” “palm,” and “thumb” subdomains. In addition they possess a unique domain that has been termed the “little finger” (LF) (9Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Google Scholar), “wrist” (10Silvian L.F. Toth E.A. Pham P. Goodman M.F. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 984-989Google Scholar), or “PAD (polymerase associated domain)” (11Trincao J. Johnson R.E. Escalante C.R. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 417-426Google Scholar). The thumb and finger domains are smaller than those found in high fidelity polymerases and in the ternary complex of Dpo4 with DNA and an incoming nucleotide; the primer-template is held between the thumb and LF domains and buttresses against the finger domain (see Fig. 1A) (9Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Google Scholar). The importance of the LF-DNA contact is highlighted by the fact that a proteolytic fragment of Dpo4 that retains the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains (but lacks the LF domain) is much less active than the full-length polymerase (9Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Google Scholar). Interestingly, the LF domain is the least conserved of the four domains in the Y-family polymerases, and it is hypothesized that such divergence may in part contribute to the assorted biochemical properties reported in the literature for the various Y-family polymerases (9Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Google Scholar). To further investigate the role that the LF domain contributes to the overall enzymatic properties of Y-family polymerases, we have taken advantage of the fact that both structural and biochemical data are available for two closely related archaeal DinB-like polymerases, Dbh and Dpo4. Dbh (DinBhomolog) was identified and cloned by Kulaeva et al. (12Kulaeva O.I. Koonin E.V. McDonald J.P. Randall S.K. Rabinovich N. Connaughton J.F. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 357: 245-253Google Scholar) in 1996 using degenerate PCR primers designed against the E. coli umuC and dinB genes. The genomic DNA used in those studies was from an archaeal strain obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) that was originally believed to be Sulfolobus solfataricus P1. However, the entire genome of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius has recently been determined and the ∼2.5-kb dbh-containing sequence reported by Kulaeva et al. (12Kulaeva O.I. Koonin E.V. McDonald J.P. Randall S.K. Rabinovich N. Connaughton J.F. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 357: 245-253Google Scholar) matches perfectly with the genomic sequence from S. acidocaldarius. 2R. Garrett, personal communication. Dbh therefore originates from S. acidocaldarius and not S. solfataricus P1 as was originally thought. Dpo4 (DNA polymerase IV) was identified in the genome of S. solfataricus P2 through BLAST searches (13Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) of the complete P2 genome (14She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J. Chan-Weiher C.C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B.A. De Moors A.

Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Google Scholar). Overall, the Dbh and Dpo4 proteins share 54% identity, yet the two polymerases exhibit different enzymatic properties (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Google Scholar, 16Gruz P. Pisani F.M. Shimizu M. Yamada M. Hayashi I. Morikawa K. Nohmi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47394-47401Google Scholar, 17Potapova O. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Google Scholar). Dpo4 is thermostable and exhibits robust polymerase activity. At high enzyme to template ratios Dpo4 can synthesize more than 1 kb of DNA, thereby allowing it to substitute for Taq polymerase in PCR assays (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Google Scholar). In addition, the lesion bypass properties of Dpo4 are somewhat like those of the eukaryotic translesion polymerases in that Dpo4 can bypass thymine-thymine cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Google Scholar, 18Ling H. Boudsocq F. Plosky B.S. Woodgate R. Yang W. Nature. 2003; 424: 1083-1087Google Scholar, 19McCulloch S.D. Kokoska R.J. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2004; 428: 97-100Google Scholar) and abasic sites (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Google Scholar, 20Kokoska R.J. McCulloch S.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50537-50545Google Scholar). In contrast, Dbh is a much more distributive polymerase when replicating undamaged DNA, is unable to incorporate a base opposite a CPD, and bypasses an abasic site with very low efficiency (16Gruz P. Pisani F.M. Shimizu M. Yamada M. Hayashi I. Morikawa K. Nohmi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47394-47401Google Scholar, 17Potapova O. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28157-28166Google Scholar, 21Zhou B. Pata J.D. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 427-437Google Scholar). Structural studies of the two polymerases reveal that in addition to sharing high sequence homology, the fingers, palm, and thumb domains of the proteins are virtually superimposable. This suggests that the different enzymatic properties of the two enzymes might lie more in their sequence-divergent and structurally mobile LF domains. For example, in the Dpo4-DNA complex (9Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Google Scholar), the linker connecting the thumb and little finger domains interacts only with DNA. In the apo-form of Dbh, however, this linker is hydrogen-bonded to the β-sheets in the palm domain as well as the β-sheets in the little finger domain, thereby pinning the little finger domain to the catalytic core (10Silvian L.F. Toth E.A. Pham P. Goodman M.F. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 984-989Google Scholar). For Dbh to bind substrate, this linker has to peel off from the palm domain to allow the little finger domain to reorient (see Fig. 1A). To investigate the role that the LF domain may play in determining the enzymatic properties of Y-family polymerases in general, we have constructed Dbh-Dpo4 chimeras in which the LF domains and the preceding linker have been interchanged (see Fig. 1B). Our studies reveal that by replacing the LF domain of Dpo4 with that from Dbh, we make the enzyme more “Dbh-like.” Conversely, by replacing Dbh LF with that of Dpo4, the enzyme becomes more “Dpo4-like,” indicating that the LF domain is clearly a major factor in determining the physical and enzymatic properties of each polymerase. We discuss our observations in light of the crystal structure of Dbh and of the various Dpo4-DNA complexes that have been reported to date. Overproduction of S. acidocaldarius Dbh—The dbh gene from S. acidocaldarius was PCR-amplified from pOS21 (12Kulaeva O.I. Koonin E.V. McDonald J.P. Randall S.K. Rabinovich N. Connaughton J.F. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 357: 245-253Google Scholar) with two oligonucleotides: ssdbhbam (5′-CGC GGA TCC TTA AAT GTC GAA GAA ATC AGA TAA ATT TG-3′) and ssdbhbsp (5′-CAT GTC ATG ATA GTG ATA TTC GTT GAT TTT G-3′) containing a BamHI and BspHI restriction enzyme site, respectively (underlined). The ∼1050-bp PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and BspHI, and the fragment was gel-purified before cloning into pET16b (Novagen, Madison, WI) digested with NcoI and BamHI. The sequence of the dbh gene in the recombinant plasmid, called pJM349, was verified and subsequently introduced into E. coli strain RW382, a ΔumuDC595::cat derivative of BL21(λDE3) (22McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1478-1483Google Scholar). Generation of Dbh-LF-Dpo4 and Dpo4-LF-Dbh Chimera—The first step toward generating Dbh/Dpo4 chimeras was to introduce a unique restriction enzyme site at the junction of the LF domain in Dpo4. This was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) of Leu-228 (CTA → CTG) and Ala-229 (GCT → GCC) codons to produce a novel BalI restriction enzyme site within the dpo4 gene. The BalI restriction site was generated in the Dpo4 overexpressing plasmid, p1914 (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Google Scholar), using oligonucleotides P2SWDW (5′-CTC GTC TCT GGC CAG AGA GAT CAA ATA TTT AGC C-3′) and P2SWUP (5′-TTG ATC TCT CTG GCC AGA GAC GAG TAT AAC GAG CC-3′) and gave rise to plasmid p1941. Chimeras were subsequently generated by domain swapping as follows. An ∼700-bp NdeI-BalI fragment was amplified using pJM349 (Dbh) DNA as a template with primers P1ndeIup (5′-GGG GGG CAT ATG ATA GTG ATA TTC GTT GAT-3′) and P1bal2dw (5′-GGG GGG ATT CTT GGC CAA CTT TAG TAG ATA TAA GGC TAA GGC-3′) containing NdeI and BalI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). The amplicon was then digested with NdeI and BalI and cloned into the similarly digested plasmid, p1941. The resulting plasmid, called p1947, therefore expresses a chimeric polymerase consisting of the thumb, finger, and palm domains of Dbh and the LF domain of the Dpo4 polymerase (Dbh-LF-Dpo4) (see Fig 1B). A second plasmid, p1946, expressing the thumb, finger, and palm domains of Dpo4 and the LF domain of the Dbh polymerase (Dpo4-LFDbh) (see Fig. 1B) was obtained by the amplification of a dbh fragment from pJM349 with oligonucleotides P1balIup (5′-GGG AAG TTG GCC AGA AAT AAA TAT AGT-3′) and P1bam2dw (5′-CCC CCC GGA TCC TTA AAT GTC GAA GAA ATC AGA-3′) containing BalI and BamHI sites, respectively (underlined). The amplicon was digested with BamHI and BalI and cloned into the similarly digested p1941 plasmid. The sequence of the chimeric dpo4LFdbh and dbhLFdpo4 genes in p1946 and p1947, respectively, were verified, and the plasmids were subsequently introduced into RW382. Purification of Dpo4, Dbh, Dbh-LF-Dpo4, and Dpo4-LF-Dbh Proteins—The protocol utilized to purify all four polymerases was based upon that described previously for Dpo4 (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Google Scholar) but includes several important modifications. Although all of the recombinant genes are under the control of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter (in the parental pET vector), we found that there was significant expression of the recombinant proteins in the absence of induction. Furthermore, the Sulfolobaceae proteins are very stable in E. coli, 3F. Boudsocq, unpublished observations. and significant quantities of the recombinant proteins can be recovered by simply harvesting uninduced stationary phase overnight cultures of RW382 harboring the Dpo4/Dbh-expressing plasmids. Soluble cell extracts were made as described previously. In the heat denaturation step that removes significant quantities of the thermolabile E. coli proteins, the temperature was reduced from 85 to 75 °C. Each polymerase was purified to homogeneity in three chromatographic steps using HiTrapQ, hydroxylapatite, and Mono S columns as described previously except that the phosphate buffer used in the HiTrapQ column was replaced by a 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.0 containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. DNA Templates for in Vitro Primer Extension Assays—Most of the synthetic oligonucleotides used in the in vitro replication assays were synthesized by Lofstrand Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) using standard techniques and were gel-purified prior to use. Where utilized, the synthetic abasic site (dSpacer) was purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA) and was incorporated into oligonucleotide templates using standard protocols by Lofstrand Laboratories. The exception was the cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-containing oligonucleotide that was synthesized and purified by Phoenix Biotechnologies (Huntsville, AL). Primers were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). The sequence of each primer-template is given in the legend of the respective figure in which it was used. Single-stranded M13mp18 DNA was purchased from Invitrogen. In Vitro Primer Extension Assays—Radiolabeled primer-template DNAs were prepared by annealing the 5′-32P-labeled primer to the unlabeled template DNA at a molar ratio of 1:1.5. Standard 10-μl reactions contained 40 mm Tris·HCl at pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm each of ultrapure dNTP (Amersham Biosciences), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, and 10 nm primer-template DNA. The concentration of polymerase added varied and is given in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5. After incubation at 37 or 60 °C for various times, reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min and were briefly chilled on ice. Reaction mixtures (5 μl) were subjected to polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel electrophoresis, and replication products were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis.Fig. 3Processivity of Dpo4, Dbh, and the Dbh-LF-Dpo4 and Dpo4-LF-Dbh chimeras. Reactions were performed at 60 °C for 3 min in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) and contained 10 nm primer-template and limiting amounts of polymerase. The primer for these assays was a radiolabeled 23-mer (5′-GCG GTG TAG AGA CGA GTG CGG AG-3′) that was annealed to a 50-mer template (5′-CTC TCA CAA GCA GCC AGG CAA GCT CCG CAC TCG TCT CTA CAC CGC TCC GC-3′, where the location of the annealed primer is underlined). The concentration of enzyme in these reactions varied considerably and was determined empirically to allow us to compare the size distribution of replication products under conditions where the percentage of primers extended was comparable between the four enzymes. The concentrations of enzyme in the 10-μl reaction were as follows: Dbh, 0.2, 0.8, and 3.3 nm; Dbh-LF-Dpo4, 0.03, 0.17, and 0.83 nm; Dpo4, 0.017, 0.08, and 0.4 nm; Dpo4-LF-Dbh, 5.5, 7.7, and 11 nm. Based upon these assays, one can clearly see that both Dpo4 and Dbh-LF-Dpo4 are considerably more processive than either Dbh or Dpo4-LF-Dbh.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Ability of the Dpo4, Dbh, and the Dbh-LF-Dpo4/Dpo4-LF-Dbh chimeras to replicate undamaged DNA and to bypass a synthetic abasic site or a cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer. Reactions were performed at 60 °C for 5 min (undamaged DNA) or 10 min (abasic and CPD-templates) in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) and contained 10 nm primer template and 1, 10, or 100 nm of enzyme. The local sequence context is given at the left side of each panel. A, undamaged DNA; B, abasic site-containing DNA; C, CPD-containing DNA.

The 50-mer abasic (X)-containing template was 5′ CTC TCA CAA GCA GCC AGG CAT XCT CCG CAC TCG TCT CTA CAC CGC TCC GC-3′. All three templates were primed with a radiolabeled 23-mer oligonucleotide with the following sequence: 5′-GCG GTG TAG AGA CGA GTG CGG AG-3′.

Polymerization reactions were initiated by adding 20 nm Dpo4-LF-Dbh or 1.5 nm Dbh-LF-Dpo4 incubated at 70 °C for 1 h and were terminated by adding EDTA to 15 mm. DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and assayed for the frequency of lacZ mutants as described (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Google Scholar, 24Kokoska R.J. Bebenek K. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19633-19638Google Scholar). DNA samples from independent lacZ mutant phage were sequenced to identify the sequence changes generated during gap-filling synthesis. Error rates were calculated as described previously (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Google Scholar, 24Kokoska R.J. Bebenek K. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19633-19638Google Scholar). Generation of Little Finger Domain Chimeras—Native Dbh is a 354-amino acid protein with an estimated pI of 9.37. Dpo4 is two amino acids shorter and has an estimated pI of 9.11. Alignment of the two primary amino acid sequences reveals that although both proteins originate from related Sulfolobaceae, they share only 54% identity overall. Interestingly, most identity is found in the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains of the polymerases, which are 59% identical. In contrast, the LF domain is least conserved, with only 41% primary amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1B). To investigate the role that the LF domain plays in the enzymatic properties of Y-family polymerases, we constructed chimeric proteins in which the respective LF domains and the flexible linker that tethers the LF domain to the thumb domain were interchanged (Fig. 1B). The first step of the process was to introduce a novel BalI restriction site into the dbh and dpo4 genes at the site that corresponds to the very end of the “K” helix in the thumb domain of each polymerase (Fig. 1B) (18Ling H. Boudsocq F. Plosky B.S. Woodgate R. Yang W. Nature. 2003; 424: 1083-1087Google Scholar). In Dpo4 this is at the Ala-229 codon, whereas in Dbh the corresponding site is at Ala-230. The LF domain was then PCR-amplified using primers containing the novel BalI restriction enzyme site. After digestion with BalI, the amplicons were cloned into the appropriately digested parental vectors to make chimeras containing the fingers, palm, and thumb domains of Dpo4 and the LF of Dbh (termed Dpo4-LF-Dbh) or one containing the fingers, palm, and thumb domains of Dbh and the LF or Dpo4 (termed Dbh-LF-Dpo4). The LF domain of Dpo4 is 1 amino acid shorter than the Dbh LF domain, and as a consequence both chimeras are 353 amino acids long (Fig 1B). Size Distribution of Replication Products Synthesized by Native and Chimeric Dpo4 and Dbh Polymerases—In vitro replication reactions with Y-family polymerases have clearly established that they are less processive than high fidelity replicative polymerases. However, the absolute number of nucleotides incorporated per DNA binding event varies considerably among Y-family polymerases. For example, recent studies suggest that archaeal Dpo4 is more processive than human Polη (20Kokoska R.J. McCulloch S.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50537-50545Google Scholar). Indeed, when replicating circular M13 DNA at high enzyme to template ratios, Dpo4 synthesizes replication products that are several hundred nucleotides in length (Fig. 2). Under the same assay conditions, Dbh-dependent replication products are much shorter. Moreover, in contrast to Dpo4, adding a large molar excess of Dbh to the reaction does not dramatically change the size distribution of replication products on the circular M13 primer-template. Interestingly, the size distribution of replication products appears to be largely dependent upon the LF domain. Replacing the native LF domain of Dbh with that of Dpo4 leads to a dramatic increase in the size of the overall length of the replication products. Conversely, replacing the native LF domain of Dpo4 with that of Dbh reduces the size distribution of replication products from several hundred nucleotides at a 20-fold molar excess to ∼50 nucleotides or less at the same enzyme to template ratio (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in experiments performed at 60 °C with a shorter linear DNA template and a large molar excess of substrate over enzyme, which made it possible to more accurately measure the processivity of each enzyme during a single extension reaction (Fig. 3). Under reaction conditions where primer usage is minimal, full-length replication products are only observed in the presence of Dpo4 and the chimeric Dbh-LF-Dpo4, whereas those generated by either Dbh or Dpo4-LF-Dbh, are considerably shorter. Based upon these observations, we conclude that the respective LF domain of Dpo4/Dbh is the major factor determining the overall processivity of the two enzymes. Such conclusions are consistent with the crystallized ternary structure of Dpo4-DNA and incoming nucleotide, which revealed that the LF domain of Dpo4 in conjunction with the thumb domain wraps around DNA and helps hold the polymerase on to the primer terminus (Fig. 1A) (9Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Google Scholar). Effect of LF Domain Swapping on Translesion DNA Synthesis of a CPD and Abasic Site—Previous studies have shown that although Dpo4 is phylogenetically located in the DinB branch of the Y-family polymerases, it actually has enzymatic properties that are reminiscent of Polη-like enzymes in that it can bypass cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. The efficiency of a Dpo4-dependent bypass of a CPD has recently been estimated to be approximately one-tenth of that of human Polη (19McCulloch S.D. Kokoska R.J. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2004; 428: 97-100Google Scholar). The reduced ability of Dpo4 to bypass a CPD compared with Polη appears to be largely caused by stearic clashes between the 5′-T of the CPD and Dpo4 when the enzyme attempts to incorporate a nucleotide opposite the covalently linked 3′-T of the CPD (18Ling H. Boudsocq F. Plosky B.S. Woodgate R. Yang W. Nature. 2003; 424: 1083-1087Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the ability of Dpo4 to bypass a CPD is greater than that of the related PolIV (25Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.-S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Google Scholar), Polκ (26Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Likewise, Dpo4 can bypass a synthetic abasic site (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Wood"
https://openalex.org/W2005673220,"We identified a novel human cDNA encoding a mitochondrial protein, MTP18 (mitochondrial protein, 18 kDa) as a transcriptional downstream target of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling. We demonstrate that MTP18 mRNA as well as protein expression is dependent on PI 3-kinase activity. Confocal microscopy and biochemical fractionation revealed a mitochondrial localization of MTP18. Loss-of-function analysis employing antisense molecules revealed that MTP18 is essential for cell viability in PC-3 and HaCaT cells. We show that knockdown of MTP18 protein level results in a cytochrome <i>c</i> release from mitochondria and consequently leads to apoptosis. In addition, HaCaT cells with reduced levels of MTP18 become more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. This effect is accompanied by dramatic subcellular alterations. Reduction of MTP18 impairs mitochondrial morphology resulting in the formation of a highly interconnected mitochondrial reticulum in COS-7 cells. Conversely, overexpression of MTP18 induces a punctuate morphology of mitochondria suggesting also a functional role of MTP18 in maintaining the mitochondrial integrity. Hence, our data indicate an unexpected connection of PI 3-kinase signaling, apoptosis and the morphology of mammalian mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2024236583,"Lipid particles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are storage compartments for triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters (STE). Four gene products, namely the TAG synthases Dga1p and Lro1p, and the STE synthases Are1p and Are2p contribute to storage lipid synthesis. A yeast strain lacking the four respective genes is devoid of lipid particles thus providing a valuable tool to study the physiological role of storage lipids and lipid particles. Using a dga1lro1are1are2 quadruple mutant transformed with plasmids bearing inducible DGA1, LRO1, or ARE2 we demonstrate that TAG synthesis contributes more efficiently to lipid particle proliferation than synthesis of STE. Moreover, we show that proteins typically located to lipid particles in wild type such as Erg1p, Erg6p, Erg7p, and Ayr1p are refined to microsomal fractions of the dga1lro1are1are2 quadruple mutant. This result confirms the close relationship between lipid particles and endoplasmic reticulum. Most interestingly, the amount of the squalene epoxidase Erg1p, which is dually located in lipid particles and endoplasmic reticulum of wild type, is decreased in the quadruple mutant, whereas amounts of other lipid particle proteins tested were not reduced. This decrease is not caused by down-regulation of ERG1 transcription but by the low stability of Erg1p in the quadruple mutant. Because a similar effect was also observed in are1are2 mutants this finding can be mainly attributed to the lack of STE. The quadruple mutant, however, was more sensitive to terbinafine, an inhibitor of Erg1p, than the are1are2 strain suggesting that the presence of TAG and/or intact lipid particles has an additional protective effect. In a strain lacking the two STE synthases, Are1p and Are2p, incorporation of ergosterol into the plasma membrane was reduced, although the total cellular amount of free ergosterol was higher in the mutant than in wild type. Thus, an esterification/deacylation mechanism appears to contribute to the supply of ergosterol to the plasma membrane.

Triacylglycerols (TAG) 1The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerols; STE, steryl esters. and steryl esters (STE) are the most important storage lipids in eukaryotic cells. TAG provides an energy source on one hand and a source of fatty acids for membrane phospholipid formation on the other hand. Mobilization of STE sets sterols free, which are also required for membrane proliferation, especially of the plasma membrane. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as in other eukaryotic cells TAG and STE form the core of so called lipid particles (1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Google Scholar), which are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with a small amount and a limited number of proteins embedded. Thus, formation of lipid particles is tightly linked to the synthesis of TAG and STE. In the yeast, ARE1 and ARE2 encode two enzymes with overlapping acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase activities (2Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R.

Kohlwein S.D. Yu C. Rothblatt J. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1075-1082Google Scholar) demonstrated that both proteins are located to the same subcellular compartment, namely the endoplasmic reticulum, but exhibit different specificities for sterol substrates in vivo. Both enzymes share 16–17% amino acid identity with human acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (3Yu C. Kennedy N.J. Chang C.C. Rothblatt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24157-24163Google Scholar). Related enzymes with acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase activity are also present in other higher eukaryotes (5Chang C.C. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Google Scholar, 6Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Google Scholar). Are2p is the major yeast STE synthase catalyzing at least 65–75% of total cellular acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase activity (3Yu C. Kennedy N.J. Chang C.C. Rothblatt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24157-24163Google Scholar). An are1are2 double mutant completely lacks STE, indicating that Are1p and Are2p are the only enzymes forming STE in yeast. Biosynthesis of TAG in S. cerevisiae is mainly catalyzed by the two acyltransferases Lro1p and Dga1p (7Sorger D. Daum G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 61: 289-299Google Scholar). LRO1 (LCAT-related open reading frame) is the only gene in yeast showing a significant sequence similarity to the human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. Lro1p mediates esterification of DAG using the sn-2 acyl group of phospholipids as acyl donor and thus exhibits phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity (8Dahlqvist A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Google Scholar). Lro1p catalyzes ∼35% of TAG synthesis in yeast (9Daum G. Tuller G. Nemec T.

DGA1 encodes an acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, which shows 44% overall amino acid sequence homology to an acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase from the oleaginous fungus Mortierella ramanniana (12Lardizabal K.D.

Dga1p, however, is unrelated to enzymes of the DGAT1 family, which are homologous to acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases identified in plants (14Hobbs D.H. Lu C. Hills M.J.

Localization studies unveiled that Dga1p is a lipid particle protein but is also present in microsomal fractions at a certain amount (10Sorger D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 519-524Google Scholar). Besides the major Lro1p and Dga1p routes of TAG synthesis, alternative pathways of TAG biosynthesis exist in yeast. Are1p and Are2p were shown to also exhibit minor TAG synthase activities (11Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Stahl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Google Scholar, 18Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Google Scholar). Moreover, acyl-CoA and Lro1p independent TAG synthesis was detected in yeast lipid particles and microsomes in vitro (10Sorger D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 519-524Google Scholar). This pathway, however, appears to be negligible for TAG formation in vivo. Although a yeast strain lacking DGA1, LRO1, ARE1, and ARE2 is devoid of TAG, STE, and as a consequence, of lipid particles, growth of this quadruple mutant is not affected under standard conditions. This observation indicates that storage lipid synthesis is not essential in yeast (11Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Stahl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Google Scholar, 18Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated, however, that lipid particles are not only a lipid storage compartment, but also harbor certain proteins involved in lipid metabolism (10Sorger D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 519-524Google Scholar, 19Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Google Scholar, 20Leber R. Landl K. Zinser E. Ahorn H. Spök A. Kohlwein S.D. Turnowsky F.

Most of these proteins are also present in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is in line with the proposed relationship of these two compartments. Although models for the biogenesis of lipid particles have been suggested, this process is still unclear at the molecular level (1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Google Scholar). The study presented here provides novel insight into cellular properties of a yeast strain that lacks lipid particles. Special emphasis was given to the fate of polypeptides that are typically located in lipid particles of the wild type. We demonstrate retention of these proteins in microsomes of the dga1lro1are1are2 quadruple mutant. Moreover, we show that the cellular level of the squalene epoxidase Erg1p is decreased in this strain. As a result, the rate of ergosterol biosynthesis is reduced, the mutant becomes hypersensitive to the Erg1p inhibitor terbinafine, and incorporation of sterols into the plasma membrane is markedly decreased. Most properties can be restored when the dga1lro1are1are2 quadruple mutant is transformed with plasmids that bear inducible genes encoding enzymes of neutral lipid formation. These results are discussed in connection with the biogenesis of lipid particles in yeast. Strains and Culture Conditions—Strains used throughout this study are listed in Table I.

GAL1P promoter-controlled genes were induced by using –URA medium containing 2% galactose instead of 2% glucose. Strain Construction—For the transformation of cells with wild type DGA1, LRO1, or ARE2 the respective open reading frames were inserted into plasmid pGP316 that is based on the centromeric shuttle vector pRS316 harboring the marker gene URA3 (24Siborski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). pGP316 also contains a GAL1P-promoter sequence from pBS SK+ (25Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Google Scholar), which was cloned into pRS316 cleaved with PvuII. The open reading frames were amplified by PCR with genomic DNA derived from a wild type yeast strain as template. Primers used for amplification are listed in Table II. The PCR fragments were generated with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan) by using ∼30 ng of genomic wild type DNA as a template in a standard PCR mixture containing PCR buffer (20 mm Mg2+), 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 1 μm of the primers in a total volume of 50 μl. After a denaturation step of 2 min at 94 °C the enzyme was added and fragments were amplified for 10 cycles of 15s at 94 °C, 30s at 55 °C, and 120 s at 72 °C and for 30 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30s at 68 °C, and 180 s at 72 °C, followed by a final elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C. The plasmid pGP316 was cleaved with HindIII overnight at 37 °C. Overnight cultures (A600 ∼ 0.7) of the dga1lro1are1are2 quadruple mutant strain H1246 were transformed by the high efficiency lithium acetate transformation protocol (26Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Transformants were grown on –ura plates for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Only these clones that yielded large colonies were considered as positive transformants and further analyzed. To verify that these transformants harbor plasmids bearing the respective open reading frames under the GAL1P promoter, a forward primer binding within the GAL1P promoter region of the plasmid, and a reverse primer binding within the open reading frame (Table III) were designed, and analytical PCR with whole yeast cell extracts (27Huxley C. Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Google Scholar) using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was performed.Table IIPrimers used for insertion of the respective ORFs into the plasmid pGP316GenePrimer (5′ → 3′)DGA1ForwardTTAACGTCAAGGAGAAAAAACCCCGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCGATATCAAGCTTATGTCAGGAACATTCAATGATATAAGAAGAReverseGACATGGGAGATCCCGGATCATTACTTATCTAGGTCGACGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGTTACCCAACTATCTTCAATTCTGCATLRO1ForwardTTAACGTCAAGGAGAAAAAACCCCGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCGATATCAAGCTTATGGGCACACTGTTTCGAAGAReverseGACATGGGAGATCCCGGATCATTACTTATCTAGGTCGACGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGTTACATTGGGAAGGGCATCTGARE2ForwardTACCTCTATACTTTAACGTCAAGGAGAAAAAACCCCGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCATGGACAAGAAGAAGGATCTACTGGAReverseGACATGGGAGATCCCGGATCATTACTTATCTAGGTCGACGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGGCAGGATGCCTTAGAATGTCAAG Open table in a new tab Table IIIPrimers used for analytical PCRsGenePrimer (5′ → 3′)GAL1ForwardGCAGTAACCTGGCCCCACDGA1ReverseATGCCGTGTGGATGGTAACCLRO1ReverseCCCGTAGAAATGACACCAGGAARE2ReverseATGGTGGTTTCAACGGTGAC Open table in a new tab Stress and Drug Sensitivity Tests—Drugs listed below were added to YPD medium containing 2% agar immediately prior to pouring into Petri dishes. Drugs tested and their concentrations used were as follows: 0.1–8 μg of cycloheximide (stock in ethanol) per ml of YPD, 0.5–30 μg of terbinafine (stock in ethanol) per ml of YPD, 0.5–10 μg of cerulenin (stock in ethanol) per ml of YPD, 0.5–8mm sorbitol (stock in water), 0.5–8mm hydrogen peroxide, and 0.1–8% ethanol. All plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days. Temperature sensitivity was tested on YPD at 37 °C. Isolation and Characterization of Subcellular Fractions—The yeast lipid particle fraction was obtained at high purity from cells grown to the late logarithmic phase as described by Leber et al. (28Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1421-1428Google Scholar). The isolation of other subcellular fractions used in this study has been described by Zinser et al. (29Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D. Fasch E.V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Protein was quantified by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10%. The protein pellet was solubilized in 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaOH. Prior to protein analysis, samples of the lipid particles fraction were delipidated. Nonpolar lipids were extracted with 2 volumes of diethyl ether, the organic phase was withdrawn, residual diethyl ether was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and proteins were precipitated as described above. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out by the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Samples were dissociated at 37 °C to avoid hydrolysis of polypeptides, which may occur at higher temperatures. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Haid and Suissa (32Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using rabbit antisera as the first antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the second antibody. Antibodies used in this study were directed against lipid particle proteins Erg1p, Erg6p, Erg7p, and Ayr1p. Lipid Analysis—Lipids from yeast cells grown to the late logarithmic phase (A600 ∼ 11.0) and from subcellular fractions were extracted as described by Folch et al. (33Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar). For the quantification of neutral lipids extracts were applied to Silica Gel 60 plates with the aid of a sample applicator (Linomat IV; CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland), and chromatograms were developed in an ascending manner by using the solvent system light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid (25:25:1; v/v) for the first third of the distance. Then, plates were dried briefly and further developed to the top of the plate by using the solvent system light petroleum/diethyl ether (49:1; v/v). Quantification of ergosterol and ergosteryl esters was carried out by densitometric scanning at 275 nm using a Shimadzu dual-wavelength chromatoscanner CS-930 with ergosterol as a standard. For the analysis of individual sterols 100 μg of protein of plasma membrane fractions were added to a mixture containing 0.6 ml of methanol (Merck), 0.4 ml of 0.5% (w/v) pyrogallol (Fluka) dissolved in methanol, 0.4 ml of 60% (w/v) aqueous KOH, and 5 μl of a cholesterol solution (2 mg/ml) as an internal standard (34Quail M.A. Kelly S.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 123-131Google Scholar). These samples were heated in a water bath for 2 h at 90 °C. Then, lipids were extracted three times with 1 ml of n-heptane (Merck), each. The combined extracts were dried under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in 10 μl of pyridine. After adding 10 μl of N′,O′-bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoracetamide (Sigma) the samples were diluted with 30 μl of ethyl acetate. GLC-MS analysis of silylated sterol adducts was performed on a Hewlett-Packard HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA), equipped with a HP 5972 mass selective detector, and HP 5-MS column (cross-linked 5% phenylmethyl siloxane; dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness). The following temperature program was run: 1 min at 100 °C, 10 °C/min to 250 °C, and 3 °C/min to 300 °C. Sterols were identified based on their mass fragmentation pattern and by comparison to commercially available standards. Free sterols were also analyzed by GLC-MS. Prior to the procedure mentioned above, 500 μg of protein of cell homogenates were extracted by the method of Folch et al. (33Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar), and free sterols were separated from STE by thin layer chromatography (see above). Bands of free sterols were scraped off and extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v) for 3 h. Then, the organic phase was collected and the remaining silica gel was re-extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v) for 20 min, each. The organic phases were combined and taken to dryness. All procedures were carried out under light protection. Measurement of TAG Synthase Activity—Yeast cells were grown on 500 ml of uracil-free minimal medium containing 2% glucose to the stationary growth phase. For induction of GAL1P-controlled genes cells were harvested, washed twice, and inoculated into 500 ml of uracil-free minimal medium containing 2% galactose. Homogenates were prepared before and 15 min after induction of gene expression. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (10Sorger D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 519-524Google Scholar) and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (8Dahlqvist A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Google Scholar) activity assays were performed as described previously. Northern Blotting—For the isolation of RNA from different yeast strains, 10 ml of 2% YPD medium were inoculated with the respective preculture (1:500) and grown for 18.5 h at 30 °C. Preparation of RNA was performed as described by Elion and Warner (35Elion E.A. Warner J.R. Cell. 1984; 39: 663-673Google Scholar). For gel electrophoresis (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.M. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 30 μg of RNA were loaded onto a 1.2% agarose gel. Then, the RNA was blotted by capillary transfer with 20 × SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate) on a Biodyne B 0.45-μm membrane (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) for 23 h. For fixation of the RNA probes, the membrane was heated for 30 min at 120 °C. A random primed DNA fragment of ERG1 labeled with digoxigenin-dUDP, prepared by using the digoxigenin high prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche Diagnostics), was used for hybridization at 42 °C overnight. Further steps were performed as described by the manufacturer. Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast cells were grown on uracil-free minimal medium containing 2% glucose to the stationary growth phase. For induction of GAL1P-controlled genes, 2 ml of the preculture were harvested, cells were washed twice, and inoculated into uracil-free minimal medium containing 2% galactose. After various time periods, 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn, cells were concentrated by centrifugation and stained with Nile Red (Sigma). Microscopic analysis was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope using a 100-fold oil immersion objective, a UV lamp, and a detection range between 450 and 490 nm. Images were taken with a CCD camera. Computational Analysis—Molecular data about proteins were obtained from the Incyte Proteome BioKnowledge Library, the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base, and SwissProt. Formation of Lipid Particles Can be Restored in a dga1lro1are1are2 Quadruple Mutant Preferentially by Expression of TAG-synthesizing Enzymes—Through the studies of Sandager et al. (11Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Stahl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Google Scholar) it became evident that functionality of enzymes synthesizing TAG and STE is essential for the formation of lipid particles. This result although not surprising was obtained through experiments using a dga1lro1are1are2 quadruple mutant. In corresponding triple mutants bearing combinations of deletions of neutral lipid synthesizing enzymes lipid particles were still formed. In the present study, we determined more precisely the efficiency of Dga1p, Lro1p, Are1p, and Are2p for lipid particle proliferation. For this purpose we constructed strains harboring inducible neutral lipid synthesizing enzymes in a dga1lro1are1are2 background (see Table I). Microscopic inspection using the fluorescent dye Nile Red revealed that after 15 min incubation under inducing conditions strains expressing Dga1p or Lro1p already harbored lipid particles (Fig. 1, B and C). During this time period of induction, the enzymatic activity of Dga1p increased from zero to 0.082 μg of diacylglycerol converted × mg–1 protein × h–1, and that of Lro1p from 0 to 0.023 μg of diacylglycerol converted × mg–1 protein × h–1. In contrast, the transformant expressing the major STE synthase Are2p (Fig. 1D) still lacked visible lipid particles after this time period similar to the control strain (Fig. 1A). It took 60 min of induction in the Are2p expressing transformant for lipid particles to become visible (Fig. 1F). Thus, we assumed that TAG formation led to a more efficient proliferation of lipid particles than STE biosynthesis. In the dga1lro1are1are2 Quadruple Mutant Lipid Particle Proteins Are Retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum—It has been hypothesized that lipid particles are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and formed in a budding process that results in formation of a neutral lipid core associated with certain proteins (1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Google Scholar). It was also assumed that proteins lacking transmembrane spanning domains were preferentially associated with the lipid particle surface compared with proteins containing transmembrane spanning domains (22Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Google Scholar). The dual localization of certain proteins in lipid particles and endoplasmic reticulum supported the view that these two compartments are closely related. The dga1lro1are1are2 quadruple mutant turned out to be a valuable tool to test this hypothesis in more detail. Western blot analysis using monospecific antibodies against the typical lipid particle proteins Ayr1p, Erg1p, Erg6p, and Erg7p was employed to localize these polypeptides in the lipid particle lacking quadruple mutant. For this purpose, highly purified yeast subcellular fractions of lipid particles, microsomes, vacuoles, plasma membrane, mitochondria, and cytosol from the wild type strain G175 and the respective fractions from the quadruple mutant H1246 were prepared and analyzed. Because the quadruple mutant lacked an obvious lipid particle floating layer in a Ficoll gradient, a zone corresponding to the wild type lipid particle fraction was analyzed. Fig. 2 clearly demonstrates that all proteins tested were, as expected, highly enriched in lipid particles of the wild type (lane 1), but completely absent from the corresponding fraction of the quadruple mutant (lane 3). In wild type, the four proteins tested behaved differently insofar as Erg7p was more or less exclusively localized to lipid particles, Erg6p and Ayr1p were present at major amounts in lipid particles and only at a minor amount in microsomes, whereas Erg1p was almost evenly distributed between the two compartments (lanes 1 and 2). In the quadruple mutant, Erg7p, Erg6p, and Ayr1p were found to be enriched in microsomal fractions (lanes 4 and 5) compared with wild type (lane 2). The amount of Erg1p in microsomes of the quadruple mutant, however, was found to be surprisingly low. This decrease was not because of mislocalization of Erg1p to other compartments as demonstrated by Western blot analysis with other subcellular fractions (data no shown). Induction of plasmid born Dga1p, Lro1p, or Are2p, respectively, in a quadruple mutant partially restored lipid particle formation and redirection of Ayr1p and Erg6p"
https://openalex.org/W2172080275,"HIV infection of the central nervous system leads to HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in a substantial subset of infected individuals. The pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction in HAD is not well understood, but previous studies have demonstrated evidence for activation of apoptotic pathways. The tumor suppressor transcription factor p53 is an apical mediator of neuronal apoptosis following a variety of injurious stimuli. To determine whether p53 participates in HAD, we exposed cerebrocortical cultures from wild-type and p53 deficient mice to the neurotoxic HIV envelope protein gp120. Using neuron/microglia co-culture of mixed p53 genotype, we observed that both neurons and microglia require p53 for gp120 induced neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, accumulation of p53 protein in neurons was recently reported in post-mortem cortical tissue from a small group of HAD patients. Using a much larger cohort of HAD cases, we extend this finding and report that p53 protein also increases in non-neuronal cells, including microglia. Taken together these findings demonstrate a novel role for p53 in the microglial response to gp120. Additionally, these findings, in conjunction with a recent report that monocytes expressing HIV-Tat also secrete neurotoxins that promote p53 activation, suggest that distinct HIV proteins may converge on the p53 pathway to promote neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2123830703,"Whereas the role of liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) in the uptake, transport, mitochondrial oxidation, and esterification of normal straight-chain fatty acids has been studied extensively, almost nothing is known regarding the function of L-FABP in peroxisomal oxidation and metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids. Therefore, phytanic acid (most common dietary branched-chain fatty acid) was chosen to address these issues in cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from livers of L-FABP gene-ablated (–/–) and wild type (+/+) mice. These studies provided three new insights: First, L-FABP gene ablation reduced maximal, but not initial, uptake of phytanic acid 3.2-fold. Initial uptake of phytanic acid uptake was unaltered apparently due to concomitant 5.3-, 1.6-, and 1.4-fold up-regulation of plasma membrane fatty acid transporter/translocase proteins (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, fatty acid transport protein, and fatty acid translocase, respectively). Second, L-FABP gene ablation inhibited phytanic acid peroxisomal oxidation and microsomal esterification. These effects were consistent with reduced cytoplasmic fatty acid transport as evidenced by multiphoton fluorescence photobleaching recovery, where L-FABP gene ablation reduced the cytoplasmic, but not membrane, diffusional component of NBD-stearic acid movement 2-fold. Third, lipid analysis of the L-FABP gene-ablated hepatocytes revealed an altered fatty acid phenotype. Free fatty acid and triglyceride levels were decreased 1.9- and 1.6-fold, respectively. In summary, results with cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from L-FABP (+/+) and L-FABP (–/–) mice demonstrated for the first time a physiological role of L-FABP in the uptake and metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids.

Whereas recent data with L-FABP gene-ablated female mice show that loss of L-FABP greatly reduces the binding capacity of liver cytosol for straight-chain fatty acids and fatty acyl-CoAs (6Martin G.G.

Although relatively little is known about the role of L-FABP in the oxidation of straight-chain fatty acids, which occurs primarily in mitochondria (reviewed in Refs. 1McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P.

Spener F. Van der Vusse G.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 121-127Google Scholar), recent studies with L-FABP gene-ablated mice suggest that L-FABP may affect liver oxidation of straight-chain fatty acids under high fatty acid load. Under fed conditions, serum free fatty acid levels were found to be low, and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were unaltered in L-FABP (–/–) male or female mice, suggesting that L-FABP may not play a role in fatty acid oxidation (8Newberry E.P. Xie Y. Kennedy S. Buhman K.K. Luo J. Gross R.W. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51664-51672Google Scholar, 9Erol E. Kumar L.S. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Kelly D.P. Binas B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 347-349Google Scholar). However, under starvation conditions, serum fatty acid levels were highly elevated, and serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels were reduced. These findings led to the conclusion that under fasting conditions L-FABP gene ablation reduces fatty acid oxidation (8Newberry E.P. Xie Y. Kennedy S. Buhman K.K. Luo J. Gross R.W. Davidson N.O. J.

However, other in vitro studies measuring fatty acid oxidation and β-hydroxybutyrate production in liver homogenates showed that L-FABP gene ablation had no effect on oxidation of straight-chain, radiolabeled palmitic acid at high levels (1 mm) (9Erol E. Kumar L.S. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Kelly D.P. Binas B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 347-349Google Scholar). In contrast, when fatty acid oxidation and β-hydroxybutyrate production were measured with hepatocyte suspensions freshly isolated from female mice, L-FABP gene ablation reduced oxidation of high levels (1 mm) of straight-chain palmitic acid by about 30% (9Erol E. Kumar L.S. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Kelly D.P. Binas B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 347-349Google Scholar). Whereas the above results appear contradictory, the intact hepatocyte and in vivo data suggest that L-FABP gene ablation does not affect oxidization of straight-chain fatty acids under normal fed conditions when serum fatty acid levels are low but may do so when serum fatty acids are high as in starvation. In contrast to the above studies with straight-chain fatty acids, almost nothing is known regarding potential roles of L-FABP in the uptake, oxidation, and esterification of branched-chain fatty acids. The most common dietary branched-chain fatty acid, phytanic acid, is produced by ruminants in the gut by bacterial cleavage of the side chain of chlorophyll to yield phytol, followed by conversion to phytanic acid (reviewed in Ref. 10Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Google Scholar). Consequently, levels of phytanic acid in dairy products (butter, margarine, and cheese) are high, up to 500 mg of phytanic acid/100 g of wet weight (11Steinberg D. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1983: 731-747Google Scholar), with average human daily consumption ∼50–100 mg/day (11Steinberg D. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1983: 731-747Google Scholar, 12Verhoeven N.M. Wanders R.J.A. Poll-The B.T. Saudubray J.M. Jakobs C. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 697-728Google Scholar). Although this level of phytanic acid is readily metabolized in normal humans, patients with peroxisomal disorders such as Refsum's disease and other genetic mutations involving peroxisomes (the site for branched-chain fatty acid oxidation) are compromised in the ability to metabolize phytol (11Steinberg D. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1983: 731-747Google Scholar, 12Verhoeven N.M. Wanders R.J.A. Poll-The B.T. Saudubray J.M. Jakobs C. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 697-728Google Scholar). Since accumulation of excess branched-chain fatty acids is toxic, especially in individuals with peroxisomal disorders, it is essential that branched-chain fatty acids (phytanic acid) be transported to peroxisomes for oxidation therein. However, almost nothing is known regarding extraperoxisomal factors that may influence phytanic acid oxidation. Several correlative studies suggest a role for L-FABP in transporting branched-chain fatty acids to the peroxisome and, thus, influencing peroxisomal oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids. (i) L-FABP is the predominant fatty acid binding and transport protein in liver cytosol (reviewed in Refs. 1McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Google Scholar, 4Weisiger R.A. Hepatology. 1998; 24: 1288-1295Google Scholar, and 5Weisiger R.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 115B: 319-331Google Scholar). Whereas L-FABP is not found within peroxisomes and only small amounts are associated with mitochondria, L-FABP levels within liver hepatocyte cytosol are high, 100–300 μm (reviewed in Refs. 1McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Google Scholar, 6Martin G.G. Danneberg H. Kumar L.S. Atshaves B.P. Erol E. Bader M. Schroeder F. Binas B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21429-21438Google Scholar, and 7Martin G.G. Huang H. Atshaves B.P. Binas B. Schroeder F. Biochem. 2003; 42: 11520-11532Google Scholar). Because of this high localization and concentration of L-FABP in cytosol, this protein can function to stimulate fatty acid transport to peroxisomes or mitochondria for fatty acyl-CoA synthetase-mediated conversion to fatty acyl-CoAs, stimulate translocation into peroxisomes and mitochondria by distinct pathways and subsequent oxidation within these organelles, and/or direct transport of fatty acyl-CoAs from other sites to peroxisomes and mitochondria for subsequent oxidation (13Pahan K. Singh I. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 986-997Google Scholar). (ii) L-FABP has two fatty acid binding sites. The high affinity site binds the branched-chain phytanic acid with Kd values ranging from 15 to 30 nm (14Frolov A. Miller K. Billheimer J.T. Cho T.-C. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1201-1209Google Scholar, 15Wolfrum C. Ellinghaus P. Fobker M. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Borchers T. Spener F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 708-714Google Scholar), similar to those exhibited for normal straight-chain fatty acids (e.g. palmitic acid, oleic acid, etc.; Kd values of 8–60 nm) (16Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6545-6555Google Scholar, 17Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Zimmerman A.W. Veerkamp J.H. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7197-7204Google Scholar, 18Wolfrum C. Borchers T. Sacchettini J.C. Spener F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1469-1474Google Scholar). (iii) L-FABP expression is up-regulated by peroxisomal proliferators, including phytanic acid (19Ellinghaus P. Wolfrum C. Assmann G. Spener F. Seedorf U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2766-2772Google Scholar, 20Wahli W. Devchand P.R. Ijpenberg A. Desvergne B. Nigam S. Pace-Asciak C.R. Lipoxygenases and Their Metabolites. Plenum Press, New York1999: 199-209Google Scholar). L-FABP has also been suggested to selectively cooperate with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α to enhance peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (21Tan N.-S. Shaw N.S. Vinckenbosch N. Liu P. Yasmin R. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5114-5127Google Scholar). Although these and other correlative data (22Reubsaet F.A. Veerkamp J.H. Bruckwilder M.L. Trijbels J.M. Monnens L.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 229-230Google Scholar, 23Veerkamp J.H. van Moerkerk H.T.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 101-106Google Scholar) suggest a role for L-FABP in peroxisomal oxidation of branched-chain fatty acid, this possibility remains to be proven. The objective of the present investigation was to directly examine the effect of L-FABP gene ablation on uptake, oxidation, and esterification of a branched-chain fatty acid (phytanic acid). The data presented herein with cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from male L-FABP (–/–) mice yielded fundamental new insights indicating for the first time that L-FABP gene-ablation (i) reduces maximal but not initial uptake of phytanic acid; (ii) Reduces cytoplasmic fatty acid transport, independent of the contribution of membrane fatty acid diffusion; (iii) inhibits peroxisomal oxidation of phytanic acid; and (iv) reduces phytanic acid esterification. Materials—[2,3-3H]Phytanic acid (50 Ci/mmol) was prepared by Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (36 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Silica Gel G plates were from Analtech (Newark, DE); Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were from VWR Scientific Inc. (West Chester, PA). Lipid standards were from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). Phospholipid standards were from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). Lab-Tek chambered cover glass slides were from Nunc (Naperville, IL). Rabbit polyclonal antisera to porcine glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), human sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2), mouse sterol carrier protein-x (SCP-x), rat acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), and rat L-FABP were prepared as described previously (24Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A. Starodub O. Roths J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 610-622Google Scholar). Antiserum against CD-36 (also called fatty acid translocase (FAT)) was purchased from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-fatty acid transport protein (FATP) was a generous gift from Dr. J. Schaffer (Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Goat anti-human apolipoprotein B was purchased from Biodesign International (Saco, ME). Goat anti-human albumin was purchased from Miles-Yeda (Rehovot, Israel). All reagents and solvents used were of the highest grade available and were cell culture-tested. Animals—L-FABP null mice (L-FABP–/–) were generated by targeted disruption of the L-FABP gene through homologous recombination (6Martin G.G. Danneberg H. Kumar L.S. Atshaves B.P. Erol E. Bader M. Schroeder F. Binas B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21429-21438Google Scholar, 7Martin G.G. Huang H. Atshaves B.P. Binas B. Schroeder F. Biochem. 2003; 42: 11520-11532Google Scholar). Wild type littermates with no disruption (L-FABP+/+) were designated as controls. Mice were kept under constant light-dark cycles and had access to food and water ad libitum. Protocols defining animal care were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University. Experiments were performed with male mice ranging in age from 2 to 4 months (25–35 g) or with hepatocytes derived from male mice of the same age and weight range (i.e. 2–4 months and 25–35 g). One week prior to the start of experiments, mice were switched to a modified AIN-76A rodent diet (5% of calories from fat, number D11243, Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ), chosen because it is essentially phytoestrogen-free (25Thigpen J.E. Setchell K.D. Ahlmark K.B. Kocklear J. Spahr T. Caviness G.F. Goelz M.F. Haseman J.K. Newbold R.R. Forsythe D.B. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1999; 49: 530-536Google Scholar, 26Thigpen J.E. Setchell K.D. Goelz M.F. Forsythe D.B. Envron. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: A182-A183Google Scholar). Genotype was verified on all animals before hepatocyte preparation. Hepatocyte Isolation—Hepatocytes from L-FABP+/+ and L-FABP–/–mice were isolated as described earlier (27White A.L. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 326-337Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and the livers were removed and perfused first with Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS), gentamycin sulfate (1 mg/ml medium), and 0.5 mm EGTA) for 10 min (3 ml/min), followed by Buffer B (Buffer A without EGTA, supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.2 mg/ml collagenase B) for an additional 10 min. Hepatocytes were released into the collagenase solution by removing the liver capsule and gently shaking. Released hepatocytes were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and pelleted at 50 × g. Resuspended hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated dishes (5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish). After 24 h, hepatocytes were transferred into serum-free medium (28Lanford R.E. Carey K.D. Estlack L.E. Smith G.C. Hay R.V. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 174-182Google Scholar), and the medium was changed every 48 h. Hepatocyte Viability and Function—The following assays were used to monitor hepatocyte viability and function. First, hepatocyte viability was monitored qualitatively using trypan blue (Sigma). Regardless of whether hepatocytes were obtained from livers of L-FABP+/+ or L-FABP–/–mice, >90% of hepatocytes excluded trypan blue. Second, hepatocyte viability was also monitored quantitatively with a LIVE/DEAD® viability cytotoxicity kit from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The LIVE/DEAD® viability cytotoxicity kit used two dyes: (i) membrane-permeant calcein AM, which, after cleavage by intracellular esterases, yielded a green cytoplasmic fluorescence (with a blank nucleus) in live cells and (ii) ethidium homodimer-1, a membrane-impermeant fluorophore that penetrated membrane-compromised (dead) cells to label nucleic acids in the nucleus to yield a red fluorescence. Hepatocytes were plated on chambered slides (3 × 105 cells/slide) and, after incubation with both dyes, imaged on a MRC-1024MP laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with an Axiovert 135 microscope and × 63 Plan-Fluor oil immersion objective, numerical aperture 1.45 (Zeiss). Both dyes were excited simultaneously through a 1% neutral density filter by the 488-nm laser line of a krypton-argon laser (Bio-Rad). Fluorescence emission was detected through two separate filters: calcein (green fluorescence through a 525–565-nm band pass filter) and ethidium homodimer-1 (red fluorescence through a 585–630-nm band pass filter). In order to limit artifacts associated with potential toxicity and/or saturation of live/dead dyes in the assay, dye concentrations were individually titered over a broad range to obtain an optimal dye solution: 0.1 μm calcein AM, 0.8 μm ethidium homodimer-1. Examination of multiple chambers of cultured hepatocytes with this dual stain assay revealed that cell viability was typically also >90%. Third, hepatocyte morphology was monitored as previously described (29Schroeder F. Atshaves B.P. Starodub O. Boedeker A.L. Smith R. Roths J.B. Foxworth W.B. Kier A.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 219: 127-138Google Scholar). Briefly, primary hepatocytes were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with BSA (4 μm) and seeded onto chambered cover glass slides at a cell density of 5 × 105 cells/chamber. Hepatocytes were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then imaged at room temperature with an MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) in the transmission mode. The images were acquired through an Axiovert 135 microscope and × 63 Plan-Fluor oil immersion objective, numerical aperture 1.45 (Zeiss). Image files were analyzed using LaserSharp (Bio-Rad) and MetaMorph Image Analysis (Advanced Scientific Imaging, Meraux, LA) software. Morphologic examination of transmission micrographs of cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from L-FABP+/+ and L-FABP–/–mice indicated the presence of multinucleated cells with canalicular structures characteristic of liver cells. Fourth, function of cultured primary hepatocytes was monitored by the ability to synthesize albumin and apolipoprotein B100 (28Lanford R.E. Carey K.D. Estlack L.E. Smith G.C. Hay R.V. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 174-182Google Scholar). Secretion of albumin and apoB100 into the medium was quantitated by Western blotting on medium collected from hepatocytes derived from L-FABP+/+ and L-FABP–/–mice. In brief, hepatocytes were plated on several 35-mm dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish) and cultured up to 5 days. The medium was removed each day and replaced with fresh serum-free medium. Removed medium was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris, quantitated for protein content by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), and run on Western blots as described earlier (24Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A. Starodub O. Roths J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 610-622Google Scholar). Levels of albumin and apoB100, determined by Western blotting using antibodies against human albumin and human apoB100, were constant up to and past 5 days in culture for hepatocytes isolated from livers of L-FABP+/+ or L-FABP–/–mice. Fifth, function of cultured primary hepatocytes was monitored by ability to synthesize L-FABP in wild type L-FABP+/+ mice. Hepatocytes from L-FABP+/+ mice were cultured on several 35-mm dishes to check for L-FABP expression by Western analysis daily over a 5-day period (24Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A. Starodub O. Roths J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 610-622Google Scholar). Levels of L-FABP in cultured hepatocytes from L-FABP+/+ mice were constant up to 3 days in culture but significantly decreased 5 days postisolation. Based on these results where several parameters of primary hepatocyte culture viability and function were examined, all experiments performed herein were with hepatocytes maintained in culture 2–3 days. Western Blotting to Determine Hepatocyte Levels of Plasma Membrane Fatty Acid Transport and Intracellular Fatty Acid Transport Proteins—Cell homogenates of hepatocytes isolated from L-FABP–/–and L-FABP+/+ mice were analyzed by Western blot analysis to determine whether L-FABP gene ablation altered the levels of two other classes of proteins involved in fatty acid uptake: plasma membrane fatty acid transport/translocase proteins (FATP, CD-36/FAT, and caveolin-1) and intracellular fatty acid transport proteins (L-FABP, SCP-2, SCP-x, ACBP, caveolin-1, and GOT). Hepatocyte homogenates (0.2–5 μg) were run on Tricine gels (12%) before transferring to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose paper (Sigma) by electroblotting in a continuous buffer system at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h. After transfer, blots were treated as described previously (31Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Petrescu A.D. Greenberg C.C. Lyuksyutova O.I. Smith R. Schroeder F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C688-C703Google Scholar) using affinity-purified antisera against (i) major plasma membrane fatty acid transport proteins (FATP, CD-36/FAT, and caveolin-1) and (ii) intracellular fatty acid and fatty acyl-CoA transport proteins that play a role in fatty acid metabolism (L-FABP, SCP-2, SCP-x, ACBP, caveolin-1, and GOT). Proteins were quantified by densitometric analysis after image acquisition using a single chip CCD (charge-coupled device) video camera and a computer work station (IS-500 system from Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Image files were analyzed (mean 8-bit gray scale density) using NIH Image (available by anonymous FTP). Lipid Mass Determination—All glassware was washed with sulfuric acid-chromate before use. In order to determine the effect of L-FABP gene ablation on lipid content, lipids were extracted from liver or hepatocytes derived from the livers of male wild type L-FABP+/+ and L-FABP–/–mice with n-hexane-2-propanol 3:2 (v/v) (32Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Google Scholar) and immediately stored under an atmosphere of N2 to limit oxidation (33Atshaves B.P. Storey S. McIntosh A.L. Petrescu A.D. Lyuksyutova O.I. Greenberg A.S. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25324-25335Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) from the dried protein extract residue digested overnight in 0.2 m KOH. Individual lipid classes (phospholipids and neutral lipids such as cholesterol, free fatty acid, monoacylglyceride, diacylglyceride, triacylglyceride, and cholesteryl esters) were resolved using silica gel G TLC plates developed in the following solvent system: petroleum ether/diethyl ether/methanol/acetic acid (90:7:2:0.5) (32Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Google Scholar). Lipid classes were identified by comparison with known standards. Spots on the TLC plate were visualized by iodine, scraped, and quantitated by the method of Marzo et al. (34Marzo A. Ghirardi P. Sardini D. Meroni G. Clin. Chem. 1971; 17: 145-147Google Scholar). Mass (nmol/mg cell protein) of individual lipid classes was determined as described earlier (32Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Google Scholar, 35Atshaves B.P. Foxworth W.B.

Uptake of [2,3-3H]Phytanic Acid and [9,10-3H]Palmitic Acid by Cultured Hepatocytes Isolated from L-FABP+/+ and L-FABP–/–Mice— The uptake of radiolabeled branched-chain fatty acids including phytanic acid and straight-chain fatty acids such as palmitic acid was determined as described earlier (31Atshaves B.P.

Briefly, hepatocytes (5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) isolated from L-FABP–/–and L-FABP+/+ mice were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with BSA (4 μm) and then incubated with phytanic acid or palmitic acid (50 nm) containing trace levels of [2,3-3H]phytanic acid or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (1.5 μCi/nmol). At intervals from 1 to 24 h, medium was removed and saved, cell monolayer was washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and washes were combined with the saved medium. In order to equate the amounts of phytanic acid using in the present study with amounts consumed daily by humans, the following estimations were made. In humans, daily dietary intake of phytol and its metabolite phytanic acid is on the order of 50–100 mg/day (12Verhoeven N.M. Wanders R.J.A. Poll-The B.T. Saudubray J.M. Jakobs C. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 697-728Google Scholar). In terms of mg of phytol/g of body weight, the approximate value for human consumption would be 1.4 μg of phytol/g of body weight/day for a 70-kg man. The amount of phytanic acid used in the current study was on the order of 0.05 μg/35-mm dish, or 50-fold"

Whether this increased mevalonate synthesis occurs as a consequence of increased requirements for a mevalonate-derived metabolite in response to rapid growth or whether mevalonate promotes the growth of tumor cells is unknown. To address this question, we administered mevalonate via miniosmotic pumps to nude mice inoculated with MDA-MB-435 human cancer cells. After 13 weeks of growth, tumors in mevalonate-treated mice were significantly larger than tumors in saline-treated, control mice (1.52 ± 0.26 g versus 0.81 ± 0.27 g respectively, p < 0.05). The cancer cells treated in culture with mevalonate also demonstrated increased proliferation rates associated with accelerated entry of cells into S phase. These cells had enhanced total and cyclin A-immunoprecipitable cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) activity, increased activating phosphorylation of CDK-2, and decreased inhibitory binding of CDK-2 to p21Cip1. Our findings demonstrate that mevalonate promotes tumor growth and suggest that an increase in mevalonate synthesis in extrahepatic tissues following cholesterol-lowering therapy may explain the elevated risk of cancer shown in some studies.

Whether increased mevalonate synthesis occurs in malignant cells simply as a consequence of increased requirements for a mevalonate-derived metabolite in response to rapid growth or whether mevalonate promotes the growth of tumor cells is unknown. HMG-CoA reductase is regulated through a multivalent feedback mechanism that is controlled, in part, by intracellular cholesterol levels (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar). Cells meet their cholesterol requirements by de novo synthesis or by uptake from plasma of cholesterolrich low density lipoprotein. A fall in circulating levels of low density lipoprotein causes a decrease in its uptake, and the resultant drop in intracellular cholesterol levels leads to a compensatory stimulation of mevalonate synthesis through up-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar). We have shown that a diet rich in cholesterol that raised circulating cholesterol levels also significantly decreased mammary gland HMG-CoA reductase activity (5El-Sohemy A. Archer M.C. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and inhibited the development of chemically induced mammary tumors in rats (5El-Sohemy A. Archer M.C.

We have also shown in mice that a diet rich in cholesterol protects against the development of chemically induced preneoplastic lesions of the colon (10El-Sohemy A. Kendall C.W. Rao A.V. Archer M.C. Bruce W.R. Nutr. Cancer. 1996; 25: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Conversely, oral administration of the bile acid-binding resin cholestyramine to rats during the promotion phase of mammary carcinogenesis has been shown to lower circulating cholesterol levels (11Melhem M.F. Gabriel H.F. Eskander E.D. Rao K.N. Br. J. Cancer. 1987; 56: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), increase cholesterol synthesis in the mammary gland (12Rao K.N. Melhem M.F. Gabriel H.F. Eskander E.D. Kazanecki M.E. Amenta J.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and increase the incidence of malignant mammary tumors (11Melhem M.F. Gabriel H.F. Eskander E.D. Rao K.N. Br. J. Cancer. 1987; 56: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The action of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol as a feedback regulator of HMG-CoA reductase has been suggested to explain these observations (5El-Sohemy A. Archer M.C. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9El-Sohemy A. Bruce W.R. Archer M.C.

In support of this notion, treatment of mice with cholestyramine has recently been shown to increase prenylation of the growth-regulating protein K-Ras in the lung (13Calvert R.J. Tepper S. Diwan B.A. Anderson L.M. Kritchevsky D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Because statins, like cholestyramine, reduce circulating low density lipoprotein, we reasoned that the increased risk of breast, gastrointestinal, and total cancer associated with the use of statins in some studies (14Beck P.

Statins are the class of cholesterol-lowering drugs most widely used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. They function to reduce serum cholesterol levels by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase activity in the liver (18Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J.

Recent epidemiological studies have suggested there may be an increased risk of some types of cancer following the use of pravastatin (16Sacks F.M. Pfeffer M.A. Moye L.A. Rouleau J.L. Rutherford J.D.

No increased risk, however, has been associated with the use of simvastatin (22Pedersen T.R. Wilhelmsen L. Faergeman O. Strandberg T.E. Thorgeirsson G. Troedsson L. Kristianson J. Berg K. Cook T.J.

Clearfield D.O. Weis S. Whitney E. Shapiro D.R. Beere P.A. Langendorfer A. Stein E.A. Kruyer W. Gotto A.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (4967) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby some statins may increase cancer risk is unknown (16Sacks F.M. Pfeffer M.A. Moye L.A. Rouleau J.L. Rutherford J.D. Cole T.G. Brown L. Warnica J.W. Arnold J.M. Wun C.C. Davis B.R. Braunwald E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (7163) Google Scholar). Bile acid-binding resins are used less commonly in cholesterol reduction therapy than statins but are still prescribed in North America (24Avorn J. Monette J. Lacour A. Bohn R.L. Monane M. Mogun H. LeLorier J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 1458-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). As discussed above, data from rodent studies strongly suggest that increased mevalonate synthesis mediates the growth-promoting effects of cholestyramine on mammary tumorigenesis. The direct effect of mevalonate on tumor growth, however, has not been investigated. Rats and mice that are commonly used in experimental cancer studies are generally unresponsive to the hypocholesterolemic effect of statins (25Endo A. Tsujita Y. Kuroda M. Tanzawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 26Krause B.R. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 140: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This precludes the use of these rodent models for direct investigation of the hypothesis that a statin-mediated increase in mevalonate synthesis in extrahepatic tissues could promote cancer development or tumor growth. Therefore, we investigated whether mevalonate supplied directly via miniosmotic pumps to human cancer cells growing in athymic nude mice promotes the growth of tumors derived from these cells. To provide mechanistic evidence supporting a role for elevated mevalonate in the promotion of tumor growth, we investigated the effect of mevalonate on the growth of MDA-MB-435 cells in culture. Furthermore, we investigated whether mediators of cell cycle progression play a role in the growth-promoting effects of increased concentrations of mevalonate. Materials—All reagents for electrophoresis and immunodetection were purchased from Bio-Rad. Mevalonic acid lactone as a racemic mixture and all other reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell Line—The human cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 was generously provided by Dr. J. E. Price (Department of Cell Biology, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) (27Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were routinely cultured in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO2, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Tumorigenesis Experiment—Forty female athymic nude mice (CD1-Nu/Nu) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) at 7 weeks of age and acclimatized for 1 week prior to study commencement. Mice were housed in microisolator cages with sterile bedding and were handled in a unidirectional laminar airflow hood. They were maintained throughout the study on a standard AIN-93G diet (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA) that was sterilized by exposure to 60Co (Steris Isomedix, Whitby, Ontario, Canada) (28Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. Meschter C.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The tumor cell inoculation procedure has been described in detail elsewhere (27Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). We used the MDA-MB-435 human cell line, which is highly tumorigenic when xenografted into nude mice (27Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 70-90% confluence, and the medium was changed 24 h prior to harvesting by trypsinization. The cells were resuspended in complete medium and kept on ice prior to use (28Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. Meschter C.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, mice received a small incision (1-2 mm) to expose the right thoracic mammary fat pad. Fifty μl of inoculum containing 106 cells were injected, and the wound was closed with tissue glue. Only those mice that developed a palpable, growing tumor were included in final analyses (28Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. Meschter C.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One week later, under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, mice were subcutaneously implanted with 200-μl miniosmotic pumps (flow rate 0.25 μl/h, 28-day pumping life) (Alzet Corp., Palo Alto, CA) in the intrascapular area and then randomized to two groups. Pumps delivered either mevalonolactone (1.5 μmol/h) or isotonic saline (control). We have shown previously that subcutaneously implanted miniosmotic pumps are an effective means of delivering mevalonate to the mammary glands of mice (29Duncan R.E. El-Sohemy A. Archer M. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The wound was closed with skin clips. At 28-day intervals, mice were anesthetized, and spent pumps were surgically removed and replaced with fresh pumps. Mice were weighed weekly. Tumors were measured with Vernier calipers by a single, blinded observer during the weeks when the wound clips were removed and wound healing was complete (i.e. weeks 2, 3, and 4 after surgery). The cross-sectional tumor area was calculated as described by Rose et al. (28Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. Meschter C.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mice were cared for throughout the study in accordance with recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the University of Toronto Animal Care Policies and Guidelines. The tumorigenesis protocol used in the present study was reviewed and received ethical approval by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee. Cell Proliferation Assay—After 24 h of growth, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and growth was continued for 60 h in serum-free medium containing 0, 0.5, 1, or 5 mm mevalonate. For proliferation assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at an average density of 103 cells/well. Cell proliferation rates were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions by quantifying the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA using a cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by repeated washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (minus Ca2+/Mg2+). The cells were then treated with 1 ml of 70% EtOH for 30 min to permeabilize membranes. Nuclei were stained with 500 μl of solution containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.38 mm sodium citrate, and 100 μl of RNase. DNA content was determined using a FACStar Plus flow cytometer, and the proportion of cells in each cell cycle phase was calculated from DNA histograms using the FACStation software package (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested and disrupted in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) using a glass minihomogenizer. Supernatants from cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and then 2-75 μg of total cellular protein was solubilized in Laemmli buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, electrophoresed in SDS-10, 12, or 15% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking overnight, membranes were probed first with antibodies to p21Cip1, p27Kip1, cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2), CDK-4, cyclin D1, cyclin E, or cyclin A (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), and signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Expression patterns of β-actin and Coomassie Blue staining of total proteins were used to ensure equal loading. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein from cell lysates was diluted in lysis buffer to 1 mg/ml. Samples were precleared by gentle rocking for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein-agarose A beads (Sigma) followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-CDK-2 antibody (4 μg) overnight. Immunocomplexes were captured by rocking with 100 μl of protein-agarose A beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 100 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled. Aliquots of supernatant were subjected to Western blotting using SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels as described above and probed with antibodies for p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. Histone H1 Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above, but in this step we used 4 μg of antibodies to CDK-2, cyclin A, or cyclin E and assayed for histone H1 kinase activity, essentially as described by Naderi and Blomhoff (30Naderi S. Blomhoff H.K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and then three times with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). Immunoprecipitates were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 25 μm cold ATP, 5 μg of histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were stopped by adding 30 μl of Laemmli buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol followed immediately by boiling for 5 min. The products were then electrophoresed on an SDS-13% polyacrylamide gel. Radioactive bands corresponding to histone H1 were visualized and quantified using a Packard Instant Imager (Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Mevalonate Promotes the Growth of Tumors in Nude Mice—The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effect of elevated mevalonate levels on the in vivo growth of tumors derived from human cancer cells. To this end, 40 female nude mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-435 cells and then randomized and implanted with miniosmotic pumps that provided a continuous supply of either mevalonate or saline (control). Thirteen mice in each group developed growing, palpable tumors, and only these mice were included in tumor measurements (28Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. Meschter C.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Accelerated tumor growth in the mevalonatetreated animals was measurable after 7 weeks (Fig. 1). The increasing divergence in tumor size resulted in significantly larger average tumor cross-sectional areas at 13 weeks in mevalonate-treated animals compared with saline-treated controls (215.0 ± 24.8 mm2versus 133.1 ± 28.1 mm2, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). Tumors in the mevalonate-treated group also weighed more at necropsy than tumors in the saline control group (1.52 ± 0.26 g versus 0.81 ± 0.27 g, p < 0.05). Mevalonate Promotes Proliferation in Vitro by Accelerating Entry of Cells into S Phase—We determined the effect of mevalonate treatment on cell proliferation by assaying the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into the nuclei of replicating cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, mevalonate added to the culture medium for 60 h increased the rate of MDA-MB-435 cell proliferation. This effect was significant at 1 mm mevalonate, a concentration that elicited a 57 ± 14% increase compared with control. Treatment of cells with 5 mm mevalonate did not produce a further increase in growth. Analysis of DNA histograms following fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that mevalonate treatment at all concentrations significantly decreased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase compared with untreated controls (Fig. 2B). This effect was largely accounted for by an approximate doubling of the proportion of cells in S phase (Fig. 2B). Mevalonate treatment caused no significant changes in the proportion of cells in G2/M (Fig. 2B). Mevalonate Alters the Expression of G1Regulatory Proteins—To determine whether alterations in cell cycle distribution detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis were associated with changes in expression of G1 regulatory proteins, we performed Western blot analyses of extracts of cells grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of mevalonate (Fig. 3). Cyclin E expression was similar in all groups, but expression of cyclin A increased by 20-25% in mevalonatetreated cells compared with controls. Total CDK-2 expression (active 33 kDa phosphorylated form plus inactive 34 kDa unphosphorylated form) did not change with mevalonate treatment. When the active and inactive forms of CDK-2 were resolved on a 15% gel, however, 20-25% greater levels of the activated form were present in extracts from cells treated with mevalonate. The expression of p21Cip1 decreased by ∼35% in cells treated with 0.5 mm mevalonate and by >55% in cells treated with 1 or 5 mm mevalonate. Mevalonate treatment also decreased p27Kip1 expression by ∼50% at all concentrations examined compared with controls. Mevalonate Inhibits p21Cip1 Binding to CDK-2—Rao et. al. (31Rao S. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Keyomarsi K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have reported that relative binding of CDK inhibitors (CDKI) may be more important than expression levels in determining their net inhibitory effect on CDK enzyme activity. To determine whether decreases in expression of CDKIs in mevalonate-treated cells are paralleled by changes in binding to CDK-2, we immunoprecipitated CDK-2 from cellular extracts and performed Western blot analyses of associated p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 proteins. Quantification by density scanning of band intensities indicated a decline of 25-35% in the relative levels of p21Cip1 complexed to immunoprecipitated CDK-2 (Fig. 3). We were unable to visualize and, therefore, to quantify a band for p27Kip1 associated with CDK-2. This was likely because of both low expression levels of p27Kip1 and low binding of this CDKI to CDK-2. Mevalonate Promotes Histone H1 Kinase Activity—The histone H1 kinase activities of immunoprecipitates of CDK-2 and cyclins A and E were assayed to determine whether mevalonate increased CDK-2 activity and whether this was the result of differences in activation of the enzyme by one or both of its regulatory cyclin subunits (Fig. 4). Visualization of radiolabeled histone H1 bands showed clearly that mevalonate treatment increased CDK-2 kinase activity (by ∼3-fold at 1 and 5 mm mevalonate). This increase was found to be caused by ∼5- and ∼10-fold increases in cyclin A-immunoprecipitable kinase activity in cells treated with 1 and 5 mm mevalonate, respectively. Cyclin E-immunoprecipitable kinase activity increased modestly (∼1.5-fold) with 1 mm mevalonate treatment but did not change in cells treated with mevalonate at any other concentration. In this study we have demonstrated that mevalonate administered to nude mice via miniosmotic pumps promotes the growth of tumors derived from MDA-MB-435 human cancer cells. This cell line was derived from a pleural effusion in a patient with metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast (32Ross D.T. Scherf U. Eisen M.B. Perou C.M. Rees C. Spellman P. Iyer V. Jeffrey S.S. Van de Rijn M. Waltham M. Pergamenschikov A. Lee J.C. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). Until recently, this cell line was widely accepted as having originated from the breast tumor. More recent evidence, however, suggests that the cell line may have been derived from an occult melanoma (32Ross D.T. Scherf U. Eisen M.B. Perou C.M. Rees C. Spellman P. Iyer V. Jeffrey S.S. Van de Rijn M. Waltham M. Pergamenschikov A. Lee J.C. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat.

Pathol. 2002; 55: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Despite being of uncertain origin, the MDA-MB-435 cell line is a highly malignant model of human cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that mevalonate directly promotes tumor growth in vivo. In the saline-treated control group, tumors grew in accordance with growth kinetics previously reported for this cell line in nude mice (27Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). In the mevalonate-treated group, accelerated tumor growth was measurable after week 7, and significantly larger tumors were present by the end of the study. This growth pattern could be explained by a small but persistent increase in the proliferative rate of tumor cells exposed to mevalonate over the course of the experiment. During the early weeks of tumor development, a small difference in proliferation would result in an indiscernable increase in tumor size compared with controls. Over a more extended time period, however, an increasing divergence in tumor size between the two groups became apparent. Our findings are in accordance with those of others who report similar patterns of growth in studies of promoters of MDA-MB-435 cell-derived tumors in nude mice (34Connolly J.M. Liu X.H. Rose D.P. Nutr. Cancer. 1996; 25: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Connolly J.M. Liu X.H. Rose D.P. Nutr. Cancer. 1997; 29: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate whether increased proliferation may, indeed, mediate the growth-promoting properties of mevalonate, we next studied the effects of mevalonate on the same cancer cells in vitro. Concentrations of mevalonate used in cell culture experiments were designed to amplify physiologically relevant effects over a much shorter time period than required for tumor growth. Mevalonate at both 1 and 5 mm increased cell proliferation rates by more than 50% over a period of 60 h. Furthermore, mevalonate increased the proportion of cells in S phase by promoting passage through the G1 restriction point, as evident in the smaller proportion of cells in G0/G1. The proportion of cells in G2/M did not diffe"

Here we report the crystal structure of the PP5 catalytic domain (PP5c) at a resolution of 1.6 Å. From this structure we propose a mechanism for PP5-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoprotein substrates, which requires the precise positioning of two metal ions within a conserved Asp271-M1:M2-W1-His427-His304-Asp274 catalytic motif (where M1 and M2 are metals and W1 is a water molecule). The structure of PP5c provides a structural basis for explaining the exceptional catalytic proficiency of protein phosphatases, which are among the most powerful known catalysts. Resolution of the entire C terminus revealed a novel subdomain, and the structure of the PP5c should also aid development of type-specific inhibitors.

From this structure we propose a mechanism for PP5-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoprotein substrates, which requires the precise positioning of two metal ions within a conserved Asp271-M1:M2-W1-His427-His304-Asp274 catalytic motif (where M1 and M2 are metals and W1 is a water molecule). The structure of PP5c provides a structural basis for explaining the exceptional catalytic proficiency of protein phosphatases, which are among the most powerful known catalysts. Resolution of the entire C terminus revealed a novel subdomain, and the structure of the PP5c should also aid development of type-specific inhibitors. Serine/threonine protein phosphatase-5 (PP5) 1The abbreviations used are: PPP, the family of protein serine/threonine phosphatase types 1, 2A, 2B (calceneurin), 4, 5, 6, and 7; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PP5c, catalytic domain of PP5; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; PPλ, bacteriophage λ-phosphatase; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat. is a member of the PPP gene family of protein phosphatases that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and is highly conserved among eukaryotes. In human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) the expression of PP5 is responsive to 17β-estradiol, aiding estrogen-induced cell growth without affecting the expression of c-Myc or cyclin D1 (1Urban G.

When overexpressed, PP5 inactivates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (2Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H.

PP5 associates with several proteins that affect signal transduction networks, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-heat shock protein 90 heterocomplex (3Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B.

The binding of PP5 to a GR-heat shock protein 90 complex occurs in the cytoplasm in a competitive manner with three immunophilin proteins: Cyp40, FKB51, and FKB52 (9Silverstein A.M.

When PP5 expression is suppressed, ligand-independent nuclear translocation of GRs occurs (10Dean D.A. Urban G. Aragon I.V. Swingle M. Miller B. Rusconi S. Bueno M. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E.

PP5 has also recently been reported to play a role in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks in association with DNA-dependent protein kinase (14Wechsler T. Chen B.P. Harper R. Morotomi-Yano K. Huang B.C. Meek K. Cleaver J.E. Chen D.J. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To date, the physiological/pathological roles of PP5 in other signaling networks are not fully understood. The catalytic domain of PP5 (PP5c) shares 35–45% sequence identity with the catalytic domains of other PPP phosphatases, including protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), 2A (PP2A), 2B/calcineurin (PP2B), 4 (PP4), 6 (PP6), and 7 (PP7). Like PP1, PP2A, and PP4, PP5 is also sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid, microcystin, cantharidin, tautomycin, and calyculin A (15Honkanen R.E. Golden T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2055-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). PP5 differs from PP1–PP7 in that it contains an extended N-terminal domain with three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. The TPR domain acts as an interface for protein-protein interactions and likely provides a means of targeting PP5 to particular regions within the cell or facilitating interactions with substrates (16Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In vitro, proteolytic removal of the TPR domain produces a marked increase in catalytic activity suggesting that there is also an autoinhibitory function for the N-terminal region (17Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Sinclair C. Borchers C. Parker C. Tomer K. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23666-23672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies suggest that amino acids within the 13 C-terminal residues of PP5 also participate in the negative regulation of activity, possibly in a coordinated manner with the TPR domain (18Sinclair C.

To aid the analysis of PP5 function, we expressed and purified PP5c, encompassing residues 169–499, and determined its three-dimensional structure by x-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.6 Å. From this structure we inferred a mechanism for PP5-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoprotein substrates. In addition, resolution of the entire C terminus reveals the structure of the C-terminal subdomain of PP5 and its interactions with the rest of the catalytic domain. Expression and Purification of PP5c—PP5c (residues 169–499) was expressed as a maltose-binding fusion protein with a linker sequence containing a hexahistidine tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site, using a modified pMal2cE vector. The MBP-PP5c fusion protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) Tuner pLacI cells and purified using a nickel-iminodiacetate-Sepharose resin. The purified fusion protein was then digested with tobacco etch virus protease leaving two vector-derived amino acid residues (Gly-Ala) at the N terminus of PP5c, and free PP5c was purified via anion exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose resin. The active fractions, identified by activity against p-nitrophenyl phosphate, were dialyzed against the crystallization buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm tris-carboxyethyl phosphine, 1 mm sodium azide. The final PP5c preparation was determined to be 20.2 mg/ml by Bradford assay and was ∼98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization, X-ray Diffraction, and Fluorescence—Hanging droplets containing a 1:1 mixture of the protein and reservoir solution were equilibrated at 22 °C against reservoir solutions containing 45–60% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. For data collection, the crystals were flash frozen directly in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the x-ray beam for data collection. The crystals contained ∼30% solvent (Vm = 1.8) and belonged to the P21 space group with unit cell parameters of a = 40.8 Å, b = 80.3 Å, c = 92.2 Å, α = 90°, β = 94.3°, and γ = 90°. Two PP5c molecules were present in the asymmetric unit. The diffraction data extending to a resolution of 1.47 Å were integrated and reduced with HKL2000 (Table I) (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Fluorescence and anomalous dispersion spectra from a crystal of PP5c revealed distinct signals at energies of 6553.88, 7134.39, and 9635.95 eV, indicating the presence of Mn2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ ions at a ratio of 1:0.35:0.15, respectively, that compete for two metal-binding sites in the catalytic domain. In light of this ambiguity, metal ions were refined with the number of electrons corresponding to Mn2+ ions.Table ISummary of data collection and refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)1.47-50.0Completeness (%)80.4Number of reflections (unique)70,964Redundancy2.9Rsym (%)aRsym = Σ|I - 〈I〉|/ΣI6.40I/σ(I)10.6Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)1.60-50.0Number of reflections65,457Completeness (%)86.5RcrystbRcryst = Σ|Fo - Fc |/ΣFo0.169RfreecRfree = Σ|Fo - Fc|/ΣFo, where the Fo values are test set amplitudes (5.0%) not used in refinement0.209Number of protein atoms5204Number of water molecules491Overall B value (Å2)23.5Root mean square deviationBond lengths (Å)0.021Bond angles (°)1.55Dihedral angles (°)7.62Improper angles (°)0.105a Rsym = Σ|I - 〈I〉|/ΣIb Rcryst = Σ|Fo - Fc |/ΣFoc Rfree = Σ|Fo - Fc|/ΣFo, where the Fo values are test set amplitudes (5.0%) not used in refinement Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of PP5c was determined by molecular replacement using a homology model constructed with SWISS-MODEL (21Schwede T.

The homology model contained approximately three-quarters of the PP5c sequence (residues 226–479). The molecular replacement search resulted in solutions of the rotation function with a correlation value of 36.5 for the highest peak and 32.7 for the second peak and an initial R factor of 0.43, as defined in MOLREP (23Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr.

Correctly oriented partial models of both PP5c molecules were then subjected to a de novo model building and refinement procedure implemented in the programs wARP (23Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr.

Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) yielded the positions of metal and phosphate ions and all of the residues at the C-terminal end of the protein. The final cycles of refinement were performed using REFMAC combined with the translation libration screw method (23Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The final content of the asymmetric unit consists of two PP5c molecules, each with two metal ions and one phosphate ion, with residues 176–499 in monomer A and residues 175–499 in monomer B. There are also two 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 491 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Side chains of 14 amino acids were refined in two alternative conformations. The final model was analyzed with PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showing 99.2% of the residues in the allowable regions of the Ramachandran plot except for Asp274 and Arg275 from both PP5c molecules. In each case, those residues have well defined electron density. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table I. PP5c Fold—The structure of PP5c encompasses the entire catalytic domain (residues 169–499), which includes 18 residues (residues 169–187) that link the catalytic domain to the TPR domain, and a C-terminal subdomain (residues 477–499). PP5c has a compact α/β fold comprised of 11 α-helices and 14 β-strands (Fig. 1). Eleven of 14 strands (β1–β6 and β10–β14) form two β-sheets that are arranged in a β-sandwich structure in the center of the molecule. One side of this β-sandwich is occupied by three short helices (αG–αI) and a three-stranded β-sheet (β7–β9) that nearly forms a separate subdomain. On the other side of this β-sandwich there is an α-helical bundle that includes six helices (αA–αF) plus the A′-helix that is immediately C-terminal to the TPR linker. The C-terminal subdomain is composed of the J-helix tethered by a 14-amino acid linker extending from the terminal residue Phe476 of the β14-strand. His481 of the linker forms hydrogen bonds with the β-carboxylate oxygen of Asp453 located on the β12-β13 loop near the catalytic site. From that position, the linker continues around the residues of the β3-αC loop and the C-helix carrying three important catalytic residues, thus reinforcing its interactions with the catalytic domain through the contact between the amido nitrogen of Met487 and the carbonyl oxygen of Arg275 (2.9 Å). Catalytic Site—The catalytic site of PP5, identified from the positions of two metal ions and a bound phosphate ion, is located at the base of a shallow depression on the surface formed by the residues of four loops: β4-αD, αG-αH, β10-β11, and β12-β13 (Fig. 1). X-ray fluorescence and anomalous dispersion from PP5c crystals revealed the presence of Mn2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ ions within two binding sites. In light of this ambiguity, we refer to the metals as M1 and M2, based upon the coordinating residues. Each metal ion is coordinated by six ligands in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry, with the bridging carboxylate oxygen of Asp271 and a water molecule (W1) each coordinating both M1 and M2 (Fig. 2). Asp242, His244, W2, and O1 of the phosphate ion also coordinate M1, and Asn303, His352, His427, and O2 of the phosphate coordinate M2. The phosphate ion coordinates the metal ions in a bidentate mode, indicating that the close spacing of the metal ions (3.2 Å) is necessary for catalysis. Structure-based sequence alignment of PP5 with the eukaryotic PPP family members reveals an active site motif consisting of 10 conserved amino acids, Asp242-Xaa243-His244-Xaa26–27-Asp271-Xaa272-Xaa273-Asp274-Arg275-Xaa28-Asn303-His304-Xaa48-His352-Xaa48–54-Arg400-Xaa27-His427. Six of these amino acids act as metal-coordinating residues (Asp242, His244, Asp271, Asn303, His352, and His427), and four (Arg275, Asn303, His304, and Arg400) help position the phosphate ion through hydrogen bonds to O1, O2, O3, and O4 (Fig. 2). The arginine residues along with His304 when protonated and the metal ions create the only large pocket of positive electrostatic potential on the surface of PP5c, and mutation of either of the equivalent residues in PP1 or PP2B perturbs substrate binding and catalysis. Further mutational studies indicate that Asp274 and His304 in the catalytic motif are also critical for catalytic function (30Zhang J. Zhang Z. Brew K. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6276-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Mondragon A. Griffith E.C. Sun L. Xiong F. Armstrong C. Liu J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4934-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the structure of PP5c, O4 of the phosphate ion forms a hydrogen bond (2.6 Å) with the nearby His304 residue, which also forms a hydrogen bond (2.7 Å) with the β-carboxylate oxygen of Asp274 (Fig. 2B). Catalytic Mechanism—Over the years, several mechanisms have been proposed for the PPP family phosphatases (32Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2313-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In 1985, Martin et al. (33Martin B. Pallen C.J. Wang J.H. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) put forward three initial mechanisms for PP2B. The first involved nucleophilic attack by an active site residue with the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate. In the second putative mechanism, direct transfer of the phosphoryl group to water proceeds via nucleophilic attack by a metal-ligated water molecule that is activated to hydroxide. The third mechanism involved unimolecular breakdown of the metal-ligated substrate after protonation of the substrate by the enzyme to form a monoanion. Subsequent work (32Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2313-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Martin B. Pallen C.J. Wang J.H. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Martin B.L. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14545-14550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that PPP family phosphatases do not form phosphoenzyme intermediates, thus ruling out the first putative mechanism. Also, kinetic isotope effect data indicated that PPP gene family phosphatases act upon the dianionic forms of their substrates (35Hengge A.C. Martin B.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10185-10191Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), making the third hypothesis highly unlikely. This leaves nucleophilic attack by metal-ligated water as the most viable catalytic mechanism for PPP family phosphatases. However, there are still several candidates for the metal-activated nucleophile. For example, in the case of PP5c, the bridging water (W1) and the nonbridging water (W2) would both be possibilities. In addition, the native substrates of PP5 are phosphorylated polypeptides that will likely make numerous contacts with PP5 upon binding and may impose restraints upon the positioning of the phosphoryl group within the active site. Therefore, because the phosphoryl group may bind to the enzyme in a fashion that differs from the binding mode of phosphate shown in the PP5c structure, water molecules occupying the metal-coordinating positions taken up by the phosphate oxygen ions O1 and O2 must also be considered. Several mechanisms have proposed binding modes for the substrate phosphoryl group that differ from the bidentate binding of phosphate observed in the PP5c structure. One such mechanism (36Rusnak F. Yu L. Mertz P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 388-396Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), proposed for PP2B, models the phosphoryl group with a nonbridging oxygen displacing the bridging water and the leaving group oxygen coordinated to one of the metal ions, which would function to neutralize the negative charge on the leaving group in the transition state. The nucleophile in this case would be a hydroxide ion terminally ligated to the other metal ion. Nucleophilic attack by this hydroxide would produce the phosphate product bound to the dimetal center in a tridentate fashion, similar to that observed for sulfate in a complex with PPλ (37Voegtli W.C. White D.J. Reiter N.J. Rusnak F. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15365-15374Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is certainly feasible, this binding mode for the phosphoryl group, when modeled into the active site of PP5c, would require significant perturbation of active site residues near the metal ions to accommodate the seryl/threonyl residue of the polypeptide substrate to which the leaving group oxygen is attached. Such steric interactions could be especially problematic (potentially involving metal-coordinating residues) if the leaving group is coordinated to M2. Also, in the absence of significant perturbation of the geometry and coordination environment of the dimetal center, this binding mode leads to a rather acute angle between the nucleophile, phosphorus, and leaving group oxygen that is not optimal for in-line attack. On the other hand, modeling the leaving group at one of the noncoordinating positions (i.e. pointing away from the plane formed by the carboxylate oxygen of Asp271,M1,M2, and W1) avoids the necessity of rearranging active site residues to accommodate the leaving group and allows for an ∼180° angle between the nucleophile, phosphorus, and leaving groups. Charge neutralization in this scheme could be accomplished through interaction of the leaving group with positively charged residues in the active site (Arg275, Arg400, and His304) and/or general acid catalysis by His304. Another possible mechanism, proposed originally for PP2B, has a monodentate binding mode for the phosphoryl group with the substrate leaving group oxygen coordinated to M2 and nonbridging phosphoryl oxygens hydrogen-bonded to the active site arginines (38Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Again, the nucleophile is a hydroxide terminally ligated to the other metal, and again, M2 would help to neutralize negative charge on the leaving group in the transition state. Additional charge neutralization is provided in this mechanism via protonation of the leaving group oxygen by His304. As above, this binding mode would require rearranging active site residues to accommodate the leaving group. The nucleophile-phosphorus-leaving group angle would also be less than optimal. All of the proposed mechanisms that rely upon a terminally ligated hydroxide nucleophile require some means of deprotonating the terminally ligated water molecule. The presence of a trivalent metal ion, such as Fe3+, in the active site could accomplish this nicely by dramatically lowering the pKa of a terminally coordinated water, thus facilitating the loss of a proton through equilibration with solvent/buffer such that hydroxide is the predominate species present at physiological pH. Ferric ion, when coordinated by neutral ligands (as, for example, in the hexaaquo complex), can lower the pKa of a ligated water from 15.7 to <3 (39Baes C.F. Mesmer R.E. The Hydrolysis of Cations. Wiley-Interscience, New York1976: 219-237Google Scholar); negatively charged ligands in the coordination sphere would tend to increase the pKa. If a trivalent metal ion is unavailable (active site metals are divalent Fe2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+), then the pKa of a terminally ligated water could only be lowered to ∼9–11 (39Baes C.F. Mesmer R.E. The Hydrolysis of Cations. Wiley-Interscience, New York1976: 219-237Google Scholar), and an active site general base would be required to form the hydroxide by abstraction of a proton. The identities of the physiologically relevant metal ions in most PPP family phosphatases are unknown. However, for PP2B, they have been identified as Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions (40King M.M. Huang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8847-8856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the catalytic domains of the PPP family phosphatases are so highly conserved, PP2B has been used as a model system for studying the PPP family (32Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2313-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and so by analogy, the physiological metal ions in other PPP family phosphatases are typically assumed to be Fe2+ and Zn2+ as well. The oxidation state of the active site Fe2+ in PP2B has been debated for years (41Yu L. Golbeck J. Yao J. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10727-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Yu L. Haddy A. Rusnak F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10147-10148Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 43Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, recent work by Namgaladze et al. (44Namgaladze D. Hofer H.W. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5962-5969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Ullrich et al. (45Ullrich V. Namgaladze D. Frein D. Toxicol. Lett. 2003; 139: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) indicates that the physiologically active enzyme has ferrous ion and divalent Zn2+ in the active site. This casts doubt upon previous studies that used the results of dithionite titration to argue for the presence of ferric ion in the active form of PP2B (41Yu L. Golbeck J. Yao J. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10727-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the argument that PPP family phosphatases have a trivalent active site metal is not on a firm foundation at this time. In addition, the physiological active site metals in PPλ have recently been identified as Mn2+ (46Reiter T.A. Reiter N.J. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15404-15409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, if there is a conserved catalytic mechanism within the PPP family, divalent active site metals should be sufficient. The acidic limbs of the pH rate profiles of PPP family phosphatases have generally been attributed to the ionization of a metal-ligated water (35Hengge A.C. Martin B.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10185-10191Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 47Hengge A.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 99-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but could possibly be interpreted instead as evidence of a residue that needs to be deprotonated for activity, such as would be the case for a general base that is needed to deprotonate a metal-ligated water to hydroxide. However, the fact that the acidic limb of the pH-kcat profile is still present for the PPλ mutant in which His76 (equivalent to His304 in PP5) is changed to an asparagine residue strongly militates against a general base function for the active site histidine (48Hoff R. Mertz P. Rusnak F. Hengge A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6382-6390Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There are no other active site residues in the PPP family phosphatases that would be good candidates for a general base function. Alternatively, if protonated His76 serves to further reduce the pKa of a metal-ligated hydroxide by additional stabilization of its negative charge and the acidic limb of the pH-kcat profile is due to ionization of a metal-ligated water, then the pKa of the acidic limb (and the pH optimum) for the H76N mutant should increase significantly relative to the wild-type e"
https://openalex.org/W2134276538,"Chondroitinase B from Pedobacter heparinus is the only known enzyme strictly specific for dermatan sulfate and is a widely used enzymatic tool for the structural characterization of glycosaminoglycans. This β-helical polysaccharide lyase belongs to family PL-6 and cleaves the β(1,4) linkage of dermatan sulfate in a random manner, yielding 4,5-unsaturated dermatan sulfate disaccharides as the product. The previously reported structure of its complex with a dermatan sulfate disaccharide product identified the -1 and -2 subsites of the catalytic groove. We present here the structure of chondroitinase B complexed with several dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides. In particular, the soaking of chondroitinase B crystals with a dermatan sulfate hexasaccharide results in a complex with two dermatan sulfate disaccharide reaction products, enabling the identification of the +2 and +1 subsites. Unexpectedly, this structure revealed the presence of a calcium ion coordinated by sequence-conserved acidic residues and by the carboxyl group of the l-iduronic acid at the +1 subsite. Kinetic and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have subsequently demonstrated that chondroitinase B absolutely requires calcium for its activity, indicating that the protein-Ca2+-oligosaccharide complex is functionally relevant. Modeling of an intact tetrasaccharide in the active site of chondroitinase B provided a better understanding of substrate specificity and the role of Ca2+ in enzymatic activity. Given these results, we propose that the Ca2+ ion neutralizes the carboxyl moiety of the l-iduronic acid at the cleavage site, whereas the conserved residues Lys-250 and Arg-271 act as Brønsted base and acid, respectively, in the lytic degradation of dermatan sulfate by chondroitinase B.

All metazoans synthesize highly sulfated, unbranched polysaccharides known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; ChonB, chondroitinase B; DS, dermatan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; IdoUA, l-iduronic acid; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; DSpenta, dermatan sulfate pentasaccharide; DShexa, dermatan sulfate hexasaccharide; C4Stetra, chondroitin-4-sulfate tetrasaccharide; DSred, reduced dermatan sulfate tetrasaccharide; PDB, Protein Data Bank. composed of alternating hexosamine (gluco- or galactosamine) and uronic acid (d-glucuronic or l-iduronic acid) moieties. These polysaccharides are found mainly in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface, but are also present in secretory granules (1Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Google Scholar, 2Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Google Scholar). The numerous biological functions of GAGs, including a structural role as matrix polysaccharides and an active role in the modulation of cell signals, are derived from the heterogeneous sulfation patterns and different d-glucuronic/l-iduronic acid ratios found in the polymers (1Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Google Scholar, 2Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Google Scholar, 3Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Dermatan sulfate (DS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) are structurally related GAGs, consisting of alternating 1,4-β-d-galactosamine (GalNac) and 1,3-α-l-iduronic acid (DS) or 1,3-β-d-glucuronic acid (CS) (5Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Google Scholar). The l-iduronic acid (IdoUA) present in DS results from a C5-epimerization of d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) at the polymer level, leading to a mixture of IdoUA and GlcUA in the mature polysaccharide (6Valla S. Li J. Ertesvag H. Barbeyron T. Lindahl U. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 819-830Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate is characterized by primary O-sulfation at either the C4 position (chondroitin 4-sulfate) or the C6 position (chondroitin 6-sulfate) of GalNac, whereas DS is primarily sulfated at the C4 position. Additional O-sulfation is also found at the C2 position of IdoUA and the C6 position of GalNac in DS creating disulfated disaccharide units that have been implicated in the regulating biological functions of this polymer (7Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Google Scholar). Bacterial GAG degrading lyases from Pedobacter heparinus (formerly Flavobacterium heparinum (Ref. 8Steyn P.L. Segers P. Vancanneyt M. Sandra P. Kersters K. Joubert J.J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1998; 48: 165-177Google Scholar)) and other sources have been useful tools in dissecting how the complex structure of GAG polysaccharides dictate their various biological roles (4Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Google Scholar, 9Aguiar J.A. Lima C.R. Berto A.G. Michelacci Y.M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2003; 37: 115-127Google Scholar). The concerted β-elimination mechanism proposed for bacterial GAG lyases is initiated by the abstraction of the C5 proton on the hexosamine moiety forming a carbanion that is stabilized by the enzyme. Importantly, stabilization of the negative charge on the carboxylate moiety is required to reduce the pKa of the C5 proton prior to abstraction. The final step of reaction mechanism involves protonation of the anomeric oxygen by an acidic residue with concomitant β-elimination of the uronic acid resulting in an unsaturated Δ4,5 bond in the product (10Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Google Scholar). Importantly, this double bond has UV absorbance with a λmax at 232 nm, thereby providing an internal chromophore for measuring the formation of the reaction products. Chondroitinase B (ChonB), a member of the chondroitinases family of GAG lyases, is the only known enzyme to cleave DS as its sole substrate (11Michelacci Y.M. Dietrich C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 56: 973-980Google Scholar, 12Michelacci Y.M. Dietrich C.P. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 121-129Google Scholar, 13Jandik K.A. Gu K. Linhardt R.J.

The crystal structure of chondroitinase B was determined at high resolution, in the native state and as a complex with an unsaturated DS disaccharide reaction product (15Huang W. Matte A. Li Y. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Su H. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1257-1269Google Scholar) (PDB codes 1DBO and 1DBG). The enzyme adopts a right-handed, parallel β-helix fold, an unusual fold observed primarily in enzymes that degrade polyanionic polysaccharides (15Huang W. Matte A. Li Y. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Su H. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1257-1269Google Scholar, 16Yoder M.D. Keen N.T. Jurnak F. Science. 1993; 260: 1503-1507Google Scholar, 17Petersen T.N. Kauppinen S. Larsen S.

Fanchon E. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40202-40209Google Scholar). This co-crystal structure also revealed the active site of the enzyme and the location of the disaccharide relative to the active site. Recently, a site-directed mutagenesis study identified Lys-250, His-272, Glu-333, and Arg-364 as residues potentially involved in substrate binding and catalysis (20Pojasek K. Raman R. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31179-31186Google Scholar). Several enzymes that specifically degrade polysaccharides have been shown to require calcium for their enzymatic activity. In particular, pectate lyase C was shown to have several bound calcium ions (21Pickersgill R.W. Jenkins J. Harris G. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 717-723Google Scholar, 22Herron S.R. Scavetta R.D. Garrett M. Legner M. Jurnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12271-12277Google Scholar) that participate in substrate binding (23Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A. Kester H.C. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Google Scholar). In addition, heparinase I from P. heparinus contains two unique calcium binding sites, one of which is directly involved in enzymatic activity (24Liu D. Shriver Z. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4089-4095Google Scholar, 25Shriver Z. Liu D. Hu Y. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4082-4088Google Scholar). However, previous structural and kinetic studies of chondroitinase B have never suggested a role for calcium in enzyme activity (11Michelacci Y.M. Dietrich C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 56: 973-980Google Scholar, 12Michelacci Y.M. Dietrich C.P. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 121-129Google Scholar). Herein, we present novel co-crystal structures of chondroitinase B complexed with several DS and CS oligosaccharides. In particular, soaking chondroitinase B crystals with a DS hexasaccharide revealed two DS disaccharide reaction products bound in the active site, suggesting that the crystallized enzyme retains its activity. Unexpectedly, this structure also uncovered the presence of a Ca2+ ion coordinated by conserved acidic residues in the enzyme active site and by the carboxyl group of the IdoUA in the complexed DS reaction product. Through kinetic and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we have subsequently shown that chondroitinase B demonstrates an absolute requirement of calcium for its activity and that Asn-213, Glu-243, and Glu-245, which coordinate the calcium ion in the co-crystal structure, are important for the enzymatic activity. Furthermore, modeling studies of an intact DS tetrasaccharide into the chondroitinase B active site suggest that calcium is essential for the proper positioning of the substrate in the active site and plays an important role in specificity of chondroitinase B toward IdoUA-containing DS substrates. Therefore, we conclude that the Ca2+ ion contributes to determining the substrate specificity of the enzyme as well as plays a direct role in neutralizing the carboxyl moiety of the IdoUA. The results of the current study demonstrate for the first time the structural basis for the role of calcium in chondroitinase B activity and further elucidate the role of specific amino acids in the degradation of DS. Porcine intestinal mucosa dermatan sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Disaccharide standards were from Seikagaku/Associates of Cape Cod (Falmouth, MA). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR mutagenesis were from Invitrogen. The sources of all other reagents used are from common sources or are as noted below. Preparation of the Dermatan and Chondroitin Sulfate Oligosaccharides—The dermatan sulfate pentasaccharide (DSpenta) and hexasaccharide (DShexa) and chondroitin-4-sulfate tetrasaccharide (C4Stetra) were prepared and purified as previously described (26Huang W. Boju L. Tkalec L. Su H. Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Linhardt R.J. Kim Y.S. Matte A. Cygler M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2359-2372Google Scholar). The reduced dermatan sulfate tetrasaccharide (DSred) was prepared by an adaptation of a method shown in the literature (27Hopwood J.J. Elliott H. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 91: 165-190Google Scholar). Briefly, DShexa (5 mg) in 0.5 ml of water was reacted with 1-ethyl-3-dimethyl(aminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (30 mg) at room temperature while maintaining the pH at 4.75 with 0.1 n hydrochloric acid. The reaction was considered complete when the pH remained stable (∼ 1 h). The product was recovered by gel permeation chromatography on a Bio-Gel P4 column (1.25 × 25 cm) at 4 °C and freeze-dried. The carbodiimide derivative was dissolved in 50 μl of water containing sodium borohydride (4 mg), heated at 50 °C for 2 h, cooled to room temperature, and neutralized with acetic acid, and the product was purified by gel permeation chromatography on a Bio-Gel P4 column (1.25 × 25 cm) at 4 °C and freeze-dried. The product showed the correct mass by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and its NMR spectrum was consistent with structure (28Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Kuberan B. Yu G. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1033-1039Google Scholar). X-ray Data Collection and Processing—Wild type chondroitinase B was expressed, purified, and crystallized as described previously (15Huang W. Matte A. Li Y. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Su H. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1257-1269Google Scholar, 29Li Y. Matte A. Su H. Cygler M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1055-1057Google Scholar). Prior to the data collection, crystals were soaked for 18 h in drops of cryoprotectant solution (22.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 15% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentadiol, 0.25 m ammonium acetate) to which 10 mm DSpenta, DShexa, DSred, or C4Stetra oligosaccharides were added. The crystals were picked up in a rayon loop, transferred to the goniometer head, and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected on a Quantum-4 CCD detector (ADSC, San Diego, CA) at beamline X8C, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data indexing, merging, and scaling were performed using the HKL2000 package (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Data collection and processing statistics for the DShexa and CStetra complexes are listed in Table I. The crystals belongs to space group P21, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and cell parameters a = 50.6 (50.5) Å, b = 74.0 (74.1) Å, c = 59.1 (59.0) Å, α = γ = 90.00°, and β = 93.9 (93.8)° for the ChonB-DShexa and ChonB-CStetra complexes, respectively.Table IData reduction and refinement statisticsDShexaCStetraData collectionSpace groupP21P21Unit cell (Å)a = 50.6, b = 74.09, c = 59.1, β = 93.9°a = 50.5, b = 74.1, c = 58.99, β = 93.8°Resolution (Å)1.71.8Total data126,405150,037Unique data44,25440,172Redundancy2.853.75Completeness (%)92.5 (65.3)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell (DShexa: 1.76-1.7 Å, CStetra: 1.86-1.8 Å).99.9 (100)Rsym (%)bRsym = ∑(I − Iav)/∑I, where the summation is over all symmetry equivalent reflections.4.1 (14.9)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell (DShexa: 1.76-1.7 Å, CStetra: 1.86-1.8 Å).4.0 (8.5)Mean <I/σ(I)>16.5 (5.5)19.5 (9.2)Refinement (CNS)Resolution range (Å)35.0-1.733.2-1.8No. of unique reflections44,22640,151Rwork (Rfree)cR calculated on 5% of data excluded from refinement.14.2 (17.9)14.2 (18.3)r.m.s.d.dr.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. bonds (Å)0.0100.010r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.81.7Quality of Ramachandran plotResidues in most favored regions (%)86.686.6Residues in additional allowed regions (%)12.512.5Residues in generously allowed regions (%)0.70.7Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.2 (Asp-174)0.2 (Asp-174)a Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell (DShexa: 1.76-1.7 Å, CStetra: 1.86-1.8 Å).b Rsym = ∑(I − Iav)/∑I, where the summation is over all symmetry equivalent reflections.c R calculated on 5% of data excluded from refinement.d r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure Determination and Refinement—The structures of ChonB complexed to DShexa and CStetra oligosaccharides were determined and refined at 1.7 and 1.8 Å, respectively. Because the crystals of these complexes are isomorphous to the native crystals, the structures were determined by Fourier synthesis with CNS (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Biol. 1999; 294: 1257-1269Google Scholar) with water molecules removed. Clear electron densities corresponding to oligosaccharides were observed in both complexes. In the Fo - Fc electron density map of the DShexa complex, a strong spherical electron density feature was observed in the catalytic groove and identified as a calcium ion (see below). The missing parts of the models were built using O (32Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The structure of the DS and CS oligosaccharides bound to the chondroitin AC lyase (PDB codes 1HM2, 1HMU, and 1HMW; Ref. 26Huang W. Boju L. Tkalec L. Su H. Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Linhardt R.J. Kim Y.S.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) using the maximum likelihood target function. Corrections for a bulk solvent and for anisotropy in the data were also applied. The σA-weighted maps obtained from the subsequent refinement models were used for further model building. The water molecules were initially placed in peaks of 2Fo - Fc density > 2σ that made at least one hydrogen bond with a protein atom or another water molecule. In the final stages, the electron density cut-off was decreased to 1σ; however, water molecules with a B-factor over 60 Å2 were removed. The last few water molecules were added manually to peaks of Fo - Fc density greater than 4σ. Final refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The final models were analyzed using the program PRO-CHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes 1OFL and 1OFM). The protein sequence for chondroitin B lyase (GenBank™ accession no.

Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar). The initial sequence alignment was obtained using the MAFFT program (36Katoh K. Misawa K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3059-3066Google Scholar). In the most divergent regions, this sequence alignment was manually improved on the basis of the conservation of structural features specific to the parallel β-helix fold, such as asparagine ladders and aromatic stacks (37Yoder M.D. Lietzke S.E. Jurnak F. Structure. 1993; 1: 241-251Google Scholar). PCR Site-directed Mutagenesis of Chondroitinase B—Asn-213 was mutated to glutamine, Glu-243 and Glu-245 were mutated to alanine, and the E243A/E245A mutant was created using E243A as the DNA template for E245A PCR mutagenesis. In addition, the putative active site residue Arg-271 was mutated to lysine and glutamic acid. The site-directed mutants were created using overlap extension PCR for 15 cycles as previously described for chondroitinase B (20Pojasek K. Raman R. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31179-31186Google Scholar). The primer sequences for each of the mutants are listed below. The N213Q mutant primers have the sequences 5′-CAA AAA CCG GGT CAG GCC GGA GGG GGA-3′ and 5′-TCC CCC TCC GGC CTG ACC CGG TTT TTG-3′. The E243A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-GCG TCA GGA TTC GGC AGC AGA GAT CAT CAC C-3′ and 5′-GGT GAT GAT CTC TGC TGCC GAA TCC TGA CGC-3′. The E245A mutant primers have the sequences 5′-TCG GAA GCA GCG ATC ATC ACC-3′ and 5′-GGT GAT GAT CGC TGC TTC CGA-3′. The R271E mutant primers have the sequences 5′-ATG AAC TTT GAA CAC GGT GAT-3′ and 5′-ATC ACC GTG TTC AAA GTT CAT-3′. The R271K mutant primers have the sequences 5′-ATG AAC TTT AAA CAC GGT GAT-3′ and 5′-ATC AAC GTG TTT AAA GTT CAT-3′. The N- and C-terminal primer sequences are as previously described (38Pojasek K. Shriver Z. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 343-351Google Scholar). The PCR reaction products were separated on an agarose gel, and the band corresponding to the proper length was excised. The DNA was extracted from the gel using a Gel Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), the insert was subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the plasmid was prepared using a Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Each of the clones was sequenced to verify the presence of the individual point mutations. Each chondroitinase B mutant was excised from pCR4-TOPO using NdeI and BamHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) enzyme mixture and subcloned into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) that had been digested previously with these same enzymes. Recombinant chondroitinase B that had been cloned in a similar fashion was also expressed and compared with each of the alanine mutants. Expression and purification of each of the site-directed mutants and the recombinant chondroitinase B were performed as previously described (20Pojasek K. Raman R. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31179-31186Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis—The activity of chondroitinase B and the various site-directed mutants was determined by adding 5-10 μl of the sample to a 1-ml cuvette containing 1 mg/ml DS in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 30 °C with or without the addition of exogenous calcium as noted. Product formation was monitored as an increase in absorbance at 232 nm as a function of time (20Pojasek K. Raman R. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31179-31186Google Scholar, 38Pojasek K. Shriver Z. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 343-351Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, were calculated for chondroitinase B and the site-directed mutants by obtaining the initial reaction rate (v0) as a function of substrate concentration at various calcium concentrations. Approximately 1 μg (13 pmol) of enzyme was added to 1 ml of DS at concentrations ranging from 0.010 μg/ml to 2 mg/ml. The initial rate was measured for 4-10 s at 30 °C in the same Tris-HCl buffer used for the activity assay. The kinetics of chondroitinase B were tested in Tris-HCl buffer to which calcium chloride was added to the final concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 5.0 mm. The slope of the resulting line, assuming zero order kinetics, was plotted versus the substrate concentration using SigmaPlot (SSPS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The Km (μm) and Vmax (μm/s) were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation: v0 = (Vmax × [S])/(Km + [S]). The kcat (s-1) was calculated by dividing the Vmax by the concentration of enzyme in the reaction. Kinetic reactions were repeated in triplicate and reported as an average ± standard error. Dermatan Sulfate Digestion and Capillary Electrophoresis—To examine changes in product profile of each site-directed mutant (20 μg) when compared with recombinant chondroitinase B (20 μg), digests of 1 mg/ml DS in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 5 mm calcium chloride were performed for 12-14 h at 30 °C. The digests were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis as previously described (20Pojasek K. Raman R. Kiley P. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31179-31186Google Scholar). Briefly, the chondroitinase B and site-directed mutant digests were diluted 2-fold and analyzed with an extended path-length cell and a voltage of 30 kV applied using reverse polarity. The running buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris, 10 μm dextran sulfate that had been brought to a pH of 2.5 using phosphoric acid, and the reaction products were detected by monitoring at 232 nm. The total peak areas for the recombinant chondroitinase B and mutant digest profiles were calculated by totaling the areas of the oligosaccharide peaks and the ΔUA-GalNAc4S peak. The ratio of the ΔUA-GalNAc4S peak area to the total peak area was then calculated for the recombinant chondroitinase B and each mutant as a metric for comparing overall enzymatic activity. Modeling of a DS Tetrasaccharide Substrate at the Cleavage Subsite—The crystal structure of ChonB complexed with GalNac-4S-ΔUA disaccharides determined in this work was used as a starting point for the molecular modeling of a DS tetrasaccharide substrate occupying subsites -2 through +2 of ChonB. Two different modeling techniques were utilized to investigate the interactions between the enzyme and substrate. The first approach was energetics-driven, where the strain created by directly forming a 3.0-Å bond between the O1 atom of GalNac-4S in the -1 subsite to the C4 atom of IdoUA in the +1 subsite of the co-crystal structure was relaxed by molecular mechanics calculations. The O4 atom was added to ΔUA at the -2 subsite, and the C4 and C5 atoms of both ΔUA residues were assigned the sp3 hybridization. Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein, substrate, and retained buried water molecules, and oriented to favor hydrogen-bonding networks. The protonation state at physiological pH was adopted, except for the active site putative general base Lys-250 that was treated neutral. The AMBER all-atom force field with the PARM94 parameter set for proteins (39Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Google Scholar) augmented with the GLYCAM50 parameter set for glycosides and glycoproteins (40Woods R.J. Dwek R.A. Edge C.J. Fraser-Reid B. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 3832-3846Google Scholar) and the General AMBER Force Field parameter set for organic compounds (41Wang J. Wolf R.M. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1157-1174Google Scholar) were used for molecular mechanics energy calculations. Partial atomic charges for the DS tetrasaccharide were obtained by a two-stage restrained fitting procedure to the single-point HF 6-31G* electrostatic potential (42Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9620-9631Google Scholar). Conjugate gradient energy minimizations were carried out with an 8-Å nonbonded cutoff and a distance-dependent dielectric function (4rij). In the final stage of a stepwise energy minimization protocol, the substrate and water molecules, as well as protein residues within 10 Å from the ligand, were free to relax up to a root-mean-square gradient of 0.01 kcal/(mol·Å), whereas the Ca2+ ion and its 7 coordinating oxygen atoms were kept close to their crystallographic positions with harmonic constraints of 20 and 5 kcal/(mol·Å2), respectively. Quantitative characterization of the six-membered ring conformations adopted by the modeled tetrasaccharide was performed by expressing each ring conformation as a linear combination of the most suitable set of chair, boat, and skew-boat ideal basic conformations (43Bérces A. Whitfield D.M. Nukada T. Tetrahedron. 2001; 57: 477-491Google Scholar). The second approach was geometric and stereochemical, in which the conformation of GalNac-4S-IdoUA disaccharide in the -1 and +1 was allowed to sample the stereochemically accessible domain for discrete low energy conformations of the IdoUA (1C4, 2S0, and 4C1). The coordinates of a dermatan sulfate tetrasaccharide with sequence (IdoUAGalNac-4S)2 were obtained from the recently solved chondroitinase AC co-crystal structures (15Huang W. Matte A. Li Y. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Su H. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1257-1269Google Scholar) and were used to generate the model dermatan sulfate substrates. The ring conformation of the iduro"

Its three-dimensional structure is reported here, solved by x-ray crystallography at 1.63-Å resolution. Metal analyses of the recombinant protein indicate that the native form of the enzyme lacks the zinc ion, which has a very important structural and functional role in all other known enzymes of this class. The absence of zinc within the active site is due to significant rearrangements in the zinc subloop, including deletion or mutation of the metal ligands His115 and His123. Nonetheless, the enzyme has a catalytic rate close to the diffusion limit; and unlike all other copper/zinc-containing SODs devoid of zinc, the geometry of the copper site is pH-independent. The protein shows a novel dimer interface characterized by a long and rigid loop, which confers structural stability to the enzyme. As the survival of bacterial pathogens within their host critically depends on their ability to recruit zinc in highly competitive environments, we propose that the observed structural rearrangements are required to build up a zinc-independent but fully active and stable copper-containing SOD.

Tuberculosis is the major cause of death in the world due to infection with a single microbial agent (1Zahrt T.C. Microbes Infect. 2003; 2: 159-167Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To ultimately combat this disease, concerted international efforts have been undertaken concerning the structural genomics of its etiological agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2Cole S.T. Brosch R.

Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). The resistance of M. tuberculosis to such reactive molecules is mediated by specific components of the cell wall, such as phenolic glycolipids and cyclopropanated mycolic acids, as well as by many mycobacterial antioxidant enzymes, including the two superoxide dismutases (SODs) 2The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; MtSOD, M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase; Cu,Zn-SOD, copper/zinc-containing superoxide dismutase; ApSOD, A. pleuropneumoniae superoxide dismutase; XlSOD, X. laevis superoxide dismutase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; MtSOD, M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase; Cu,Zn-SOD, copper/zinc-containing superoxide dismutase; ApSOD, A. pleuropneumoniae superoxide dismutase; XlSOD, X. laevis superoxide dismutase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. encoded by the sodA and sodC genes.SODs are widely distributed enzymes that are classified according to the metal cofactors involved in the redox reaction, which catalyze the disproportionation of the superoxide radical ( O2−) into molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (4Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). As the investigation of the strategies used by M. tuberculosis to withstand the toxicity of reactive oxygen species may be considered of interest for the development of novel anti-tubercular strategies, several studies have been focused on the role and structure of mycobacterial SODs. M. tuberculosis sodA encodes an iron-containing SOD that is actively secreted to inhibit the host responses to mycobacterial infections (5Edwards K.M. Cynamon M.H. Voladri R.K. Hager C.C. DeStefano M.S. Tham K.T. Lakey D.L. Bochan M.R. Kernodle D.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 2213-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The structure of this enzyme is very similar to that of other iron- or manganese-containing bacterial SODs (6Cooper J.B. McIntyre K. Badasso M.O. Wood S.P. Zhang Y. Garbe T.R. Young D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, sodC encodes a membrane-bound enzyme (7D'Orazio M. Folcarelli S. Mariani F. Colizzi V. Rotilio G. Battistoni A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that helps M. tuberculosis to survive in macrophages that generate a robust oxidative burst (8Piddington D.L. Fang F.C. Laessig T. Cooper A.M. Orme I.M. Buchmeier N.A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4980-4987Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with growing observations showing that sodC-null mutants of several pathogens are attenuated in animal models (9Battistoni A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1326-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional reason to consider the sodC-encoded SOD (hereafter referred to as MtSOD) to be important for the protection of M. tuberculosis from reactive oxygen species generated by macrophages is that sodC is up-regulated upon entry into human macrophages, when superoxide production by NADPH oxidase is expected to be very high (7D'Orazio M. Folcarelli S. Mariani F. Colizzi V. Rotilio G. Battistoni A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcription of sodC is repressed during mycobacterial non-replicating persistence in mice, when phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity drops to very low levels (10Shi L. Jung Y.J. Tyagi S. Gennaro M.L. North R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Copper/zinc-containing SODs (Cu,Zn-SODs) are characterized by a conserved arrangement of the redox center, where Cu2+ is coordinated by four histidines, and the zinc ion is bound by three histidines and one aspartic acid. The two metal ions are simultaneously coordinated by a common histidine ligand (termed the “histidine bridge” or the “bridging imidazolate”), forming a structural motif found so far only in Cu,Zn-SODs (11Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The copper ion is cyclically reduced and oxidized during successive encounters with the substrate (12McAdam M.E. Fielden E.M. Lavelle F. Calabrese L. Cocco D. Rotilio G. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas the zinc ion has a very important structural role (13Forman H.S. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been shown to finely modulate the redox properties of the copper ion (14Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Although its primary sequence shows some unusual features, the sodC-encoded enzyme is classified as a Cu,Zn-SOD due to its sequence homology to other enzymes belonging to this family (2Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T.

Albeit this enzyme shows clear structural homology to the other enzymes of the Cu,Zn-SOD family, it was found to be fully functional despite the lack of the zinc ion in the active site and consequent structural rearrangements. The structure additionally presents a novel intersubunit interface distinct from those so far observed for dimer interactions in eukaryotic and prokaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMtSOD Expression and Purification—Soluble recombinant MtSOD was purified from Escherichia coli 71/18 cells harboring plasmid pΔCysMycSOD (7D'Orazio M. Folcarelli S. Mariani F. Colizzi V. Rotilio G. Battistoni A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB broth supplemented with 125 μm CuSO4, and MtSOD expression was induced in the early logarithmic phase by the addition of 4 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three hours after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the periplasmic proteins were extracted as described previously (16Battistoni A. Folcarelli S. Cervone L. Polizio F. Desideri A. Giartosio A. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5655-5661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), loaded onto a HiLoad 16/10 Q-Sepharose fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences), and fractionated with a 0-150 mm NaCl linear gradient. Fractions containing MtSOD were concentrated and injected onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.15 m NaCl. MtSOD eluted in a single peak with an apparent molecular mass close to 50 kDa. As a final step, the enzyme was further subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on a HiLoad 16/10 Q-Sepharose column (Amersham-Biotech) using a 0-0.2 m NaCl linear gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). At this stage, the protein appeared to be >95% homogeneous, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentration was evaluated by the method of Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr L.A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine the metal content of MtSOD, the purified protein was extensively dialyzed against Chelex 100-treated 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and then analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 300 spectrometer equipped with a HGA-800 graphite furnace. The copper content was found to be between 0.6 and 0.8 eq/enzyme subunit depending on the preparations, whereas only a trace amount of zinc was found.Activity Assays—SOD activity assays as a function of pH and ionic strength were carried out by the pulse radiolysis method (18Fielden E.M. Roberts P.B. Bray R.C. Lowe D.J. Mautner G.N. Rotilio G. Calabrese L. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) as recently described (19Pesce A. Battistoni A. Stroppolo M.E. Polizio F. Nardini M. Kroll J.S. Langford P.R. O'Neill P. Sette M. Desideri A. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Spectroscopy—Electronic absorption studies were carried out using a Beckman Coulter DU 800 UV-visible spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were recorded at 298 K with a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer operating at 9.82 GHz using a high sensitivity TM110 cavity and flat glass capillaries. The protein copper concentration was 1 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl. The pH titration was carried out by adding small amounts of 1 m NaOH; the pH was determined before and after each EPR measurement using a pH microelectrode.Demetallation/Remetallation of MtSOD—To remove metals from MtSOD, 10 mg/ml samples of the enzyme were initially dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8) and 2 mm EDTA and then for 24 h against 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.8) and 0.1 m NaCl to remove EDTA. These samples were subsequently dialyzed twice against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and finally against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5). The complete absence of zinc and copper ions was verified by atomic absorption analysis. To investigate the presence of a functional zinc-binding site, CoCl2 or ZnCl2 was added to the copper-reconstituted enzyme, and metal uptake was checked by monitoring changes in the electronic and EPR spectra and by atomic absorption analyses.Crystallization—Crystallization setups utilizing the hanging drop vapor diffusion method produced well diffracting crystals in the form of plates in a couple of days. For all crystallization experiments, a single batch of MtSOD preparation with a concentration of 10 mg/ml was used. The optimal crystallization condition is 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 20 mm ZnCl2, and 100 mm Tris (pH 8.2).Data Collection and Data Processing—Prior to data collection, the crystals were transferred to a cryoprotecting solution containing 20% glycerol and a slightly elevated polyethylene glycol 4000 concentration. The crystals were flash-frozen and kept under a 100 K dry nitrogen stream during data acquisition. The diffraction data were collected at the ID13 microfocus beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, where the fine focus of the x-ray beam allows collection of data from small but perfect regions of slightly imperfect crystals. 180 rotation images with a 1° oscillation angle were collected in one pass without significant overloads in the low resolution regime. The data were integrated and scaled by XDS (20Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3213) Google Scholar) and were converted to CCP4 MTZ format.

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—The crystal structure of MtSOD was solved by molecular replacement utilizing the structure of a Cu,Zn-SOD from yeast (Protein Data Bank code 1JCV) as a search model. The first solution peak of the rotation function in MOLREP (21Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4118) Google Scholar) was identified as the correct solution with nearly 2-fold peak height compared with the rest. The molecular replacement solution was used as input to the ARP/wARP program suite (22Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) without any modification to the template sequence. In the first step, 25 cycles of the protocol “Improvement of Model by Atom Update and Refinement” were applied, followed by 50 cycles of refinement with automatic main chain tracing at the end of each 10 refinement cycles. This procedure resulted in a protein structure of 162 residues of two peptide chains. The correct side chains were unambiguously docked by the helper program GUISIDE. Nine additional residues were manually added to the structure. The refinement of the structure was carried out with REFMAC Version 5.1.24 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13774) Google Scholar) as included in CCP4 Version 4.2.2 (24Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19702) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added to the structure by ARP/wARP (CCP4 version) after each of five REFMAC cycles. The refinement of the structure was completed when correct geometry and good correlation with diffraction data had been reached as judged from root mean square deviation from ideal geometry, R- and free R-factors, respectively. The structure was validated prior to submission to the Protein Data Bank using PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 265: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and SFCheck (26Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Details of refinement statistics are shown in Table I.Structure-based Alignment and Structural Comparisons—The structure-based alignment was generated with the program TOPP from the CCP4 program suite (27Lu G. Protein Data Bank Quarterly Newsletter. 1996; 78: 10-11Google Scholar) using an MtSOD monomer on which the structures of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae SOD (ApSOD) and Xenopus laevis SOD (XlSOD) monomers were superimposed. The program TOPP was set to the default parameters, counting a pair of residues as matching residues if there are at least three residues in a consecutive fragment of which C-α atoms are within 3.8 Å in the superimposed structures.Structural comparisons and classifications were performed with the STRUCLA metaserver (28Sasin J.M. Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A default distance cutoff of 3.5 Å was used to define atomic equivalencies after optimal superposition. Phylogenetic trees were built and analyzed with TreeView (29Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSThe sodC gene of M. tuberculosis encodes an SOD of 240 residues (Swiss-Prot accession number P96278), which is posttranslationally modified by cleaving a 32-amino acid long leader peptide from the N terminus. The mature protein is anchored to the bacterial membrane via a glyceride/fatty acid lipid attached to its N-terminal cysteine residue (7D'Orazio M. Folcarelli S. Mariani F. Colizzi V. Rotilio G. Battistoni A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To facilitate the biochemical characterization of the enzyme, the mature protein was expressed as a periplasmic soluble form in E. coli. The numbering of the sequence starts from the N-terminal cysteine of the mature protein as shown in Fig. 1, and this numbering scheme is used throughout.Crystallographic Analysis—The refined model of MtSOD reported here consists of one monomer containing a total of 170 residues, one copper ion, and 252 water molecules. No zinc ion is present in the crystal structure, although Zn2+ had been added to the crystallization mixture. The occupancy of the copper ion was set to 0.75 in agreement with σA-weighted (2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc) difference density maps. The crystallographic R-factor and free R-factor for the refined model are 0.150 and 0.190 for the diffraction data in the 27.95- to 1.63-Å resolution range (Table I). The electron density is clearly defined for residues 38-208, whereas residues 1-37 are not visible in the electron density.Overall Structure and Comparison with Other Cu,Zn-SOD Structures—MtSOD adopts the eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel with Greek key topology that is typical of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs (30Bordo D.

John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom2001: 1284-1300Google Scholar). Such a topological organization allows the closure of the β-barrel through two external crossing loops (Fig. 2A). Residue 38 is at the beginning of β-strand 1a of the classical Cu,Zn-SOD scaffold (Figs. 1 and 2A). The preceding 37 residues are probably not ordered due to the extreme flexibility of this N-terminal region, which is involved in the connection to the membrane (7D'Orazio M. Folcarelli S. Mariani F.

Two completely independent measurements of structural divergence (PRIDE and rmsd_100) are shown in the Tables II and III. rmsd_100 is the root mean square deviation that would have been observed after optimal superposition if the proteins being compared had 100 residues, and PRIDE is a probability value based on C-α-C-α distance comparison. The perfect matching between three-dimensional structures of two proteins is associated with values for rmsd_100 of 0.0 and for PRIDE of 1.00. Large rmsd_100 values indicate very divergent models as well as PRIDE values close to 0.0.Table IIAverage PRIDE values (standard deviations on the last digit in parentheses) obtained by comparing the SODs of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and M. tuberculosisPRIDE valuesProkaryoticEukaryoticM. tuberculosisProkaryotic0.89 (4)0.77 (2)0.63 (6)Eukaryotic0.77 (2)0.96 (1)0.76 (2)M. tuberculosis0.63 (6)0.76 (2) Open table in a new tab Table IIIAverage rmsd_100 values (standard deviations on the last digit in parentheses) obtained by comparing the SODs of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and M. tuberculosisrmsd_100 valuesProkaryoticEukaryoticM. tuberculosisProkaryotic0.27 (2)0.70 (1)0.60 (2)Eukaryotic0.70 (1)0.23 (1)0.63 (1)M. tuberculosis0.60 (2)0.63 (1) Open table in a new tab Active Site and Zinc Subloop—The active site of Cu,Zn-SODs is located at the bottom of an ∼7-Å long protein channel built by residues belonging to the S-S subloop and residues belonging to the electrostatic loop.

The distances of the copper ion from these residues are 2.07 Å (Cu-His84 N-δ1), 2.05 (Cu-His86 N-ϵ2), 2.04 Å (Cu-His163 N-ϵ2), and 1.93 Å (Cu-H2O), whereas the fourth putative ligand (His112 N-ϵ2), which corresponds to the bridging ligand present in all the other Cu,Zn-SODs, is situated 3.29 Å from the copper ion (Fig. 1 and 3A).Fig. 3A, active center of MtSOD showing the copper ion and its coordinating residues as well as electron density of a 2Fo - Fc map contoured at the 1.4σ level.

Conserved residues in Cu,Zn-SODs (bovine numbering) are labeled in black; residues mutated or unique in MtSOD are labeled in red. The zinc subloop of MtSOD is significantly shorter and lacks some of the residues indispensable for zinc binding such as His69 and His78 (bovine numbering). His69 is missing due to deletion of part of the zinc subloop in MtSOD, whereas His78 is mutated to Ala123 in all mycobacterial SODs.

Different isolates of hamster-adapted scrapie (263K, 22A-H, and ME7-H) and BSE (BSE-H) were passaged in Syrian hamsters. Two of these agents, 22A-H and ME7-H, caused TSEs with indistinguishable clinical symptoms, neuropathological changes, and electrophoretic mobilities and glycosylation patterns of PrP27–30. However, FT-IR spectroscopy revealed that PrP27–30 of all four isolates featured different characteristics in the secondary structure, allowing a clear distinction between the passaged TSE agents. FT-IR analysis showed that phenotypic information is mirrored in β-sheet and other secondary structure elements of PrP27–30, also in cases where immunobiochemical typing failed to detect structural differences.

After the initial reports on the emergence of BSE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in 1986 and 1996, respectively, compelling evidence has gradually accumulated that the latter can most likely be attributed to transmissions, presumably via contaminated food, of BSE agent from cattle to man (1Bruce M.E.

Therefore, effective infection control measures for the containment and repression of BSE have become a matter of crucial importance to public health. According to the present state of knowledge, the countermeasures implemented in response to the BSE epidemic are expected to minimize or even eliminate the risk of new primary variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease infections of humans directly originating from bovines (5Bradley R. Rabenau H.F. Cinatl J. Doerr H.W. Prions: A Challenge for Science, Medicine, and the Public Health System. S. Karger AG, Basel, Switzerland2004: 146-185Google Scholar). However, further challenges in the area of infection control arise from the hypothetical risk that the BSE agent might have spread via contaminated feed such as meat and bone meal to sheep (5Bradley R. Rabenau H.F. Cinatl J. Doerr H.W. Prions: A Challenge for Science, Medicine, and the Public Health System. S. Karger AG, Basel, Switzerland2004: 146-185Google Scholar) and that BSE, like scrapie, might now be sustained in the ovine population. The clinical symptoms of scrapie, which has been endemic in sheep for centuries without any apparent association with human disease, cannot be reliably distinguished from those exhibited by experimentally challenged BSE-infected ovines. “While it is possible to demonstrate the presence of a TSE by several laboratory techniques using microscopy, electron microscopy, or immunological methods which detect the abnormal form of the prion protein, distinguishing between one strain of scrapie and another, and between BSE and scrapie, is not straightforward” (6, Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (1999) http://www.seac.gov.uk/publicats/sub-rep.pdf,Google Scholar). So far, reliable differentiation of BSE and scrapie in sheep has required time-consuming and expensive strain-typing in mice using lesion profiles (7Fraser H. Dickinson A.G. J. Comp. Pathol. 1973; 83: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of new methods for an inexpensive, robust, and rapid discrimination between BSE and scrapie constitutes a topical challenge in the surveillance of ovine TSEs addressed in a variety of studies (8Baron T.G. Madec J.Y. Calavas D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 3701-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hope J. Wood S.C. Birkett C.R. Chong A. Bruce M.E. Cairns D. Goldmann W. Hunter N. Bostock C.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). During the past few years, considerable progress has been achieved in this field of TSE research, predominantly by using immunobiochemical techniques (10Kuczius T. Groschup M.H. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 406-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Stack M.J. Chaplin M.J. Clark J. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 104: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Lezmi S. Martin S. Simon S.

However, apart from having some practical intricacies (14Notari S. Capellari S. Giese A. Westner I. Baruzzi A. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H.A. Parchi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16797-16804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), these approaches require specific adjustments for each individual combination of TSE strain and host species. Therefore, alternative methods of strain differentiation, which do not require specific antibodies and can also be applied to a broad spectrum of TSEs and host species, would substantially improve our means for the molecular typing of TSE agents not only in sheep but also potentially in cattle and humans. The causative agent of TSEs is widely considered to represent a new biological principle of infection. The prion hypothesis (15Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar) holds that TSE agents (“prions”) consist essentially if not entirely of misfolded prion protein PrPSc. The normal cellular isoform of this protein (PrPC) is expressed in neurons, lymphoid cells, and other tissues of mammals. According to the “protein only” model of the prion hypothesis, TSE agents replicate through a molecular mechanism in which abnormally folded PrPSc acts as a catalyst or template nucleus, which recruits cellular prion protein and transforms it into its own “infectious” spatial structure (for a review see Ref. 16Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). This etiological model implies that the characteristic phenotypic features of different scrapie and other TSE agents, of which more than 20 have been isolated in different breeds of mice alone (17Bruce M.E. Br. Med. Bull. 2003; 66: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), must be coded in the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of PrPSc or in its specific glycosylation. While PrPC contains about 42% α-helical and only 3% β-sheet structure, PrPSc is substantially made up of β-sheets and exhibits a markedly reduced α-helical proportion (18Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 19Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Lloyd D.H. Gabriel J.M. Holtzman D.M. Cohen F.

Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Therefore, within the framework of the “protein only” model of the prion hypothesis, the secondary structure and, more specifically, the β-sheets of PrPSc molecules appear as key candidates for coding the phenotypic characteristics of TSE strains. During the past few years it has been conclusively shown that several different TSE strains can be distinguished by immunobiochemical typing of the electrophoretic mobilities and glycosylation characteristics of PrPSc (or its protease-resistant core, PrP27–30) in the Western blot (21Collinge J. Sidle K.C. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 22Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M.

Birkett C.R. Wood S.C. Hope J. Nature. 1997; 386: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When comparing two strains of hamster-adapted transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), termed hyper (HY) and drowsy (DY), the unglycosylated fraction of PrP27–30 derived from HY- and DY-PrPSc by digestion with proteinase K exhibited different apparent molecular masses of 21 and 19 kDa, respectively (25Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experimental evidence for the presence of differentially accessible cleavage sites in HY- and DY-PrPSc could most plausibly be accounted for by differences in the conformation of the misfolded prion protein molecules that were derived from PrPC with an identical amino acid sequence. Consistent with these findings, a conformation-dependent immunoassay has provided further indirect evidence that PrPSc molecules from HY- and DY-TME as well as from six other hamster-adapted TSE strains have differences in the three-dimensional structure of their polypeptide chains (26Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). When Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to directly investigate the structure of prion proteins associated with different TSE strains, the conclusions described above were confirmed and substantially expanded by showing that PrPSc extracts from HY- and DY-TME in hamsters exhibit different β-sheet structures (27Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Bessen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32230-32235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, conceptual as well as experimental clues strongly point to strain-specific phenotypic information of TSE agents either being encoded or at least mirrored in the secondary structure of PrPSc. This suggests FT-IR spectroscopic structural profiling of PrPSc or PrP27–30, a technique that should efficiently resolve differences in the secondary structure of the protein, as a promising tool for the molecular typing and differentiation of TSE agents. With this rationale, the experiments described in this report pursued two aims. First, we intended to identify in laboratory animals TSE agents that cause similarly presenting TSEs and thereby mirror the diagnostic challenge of distinguishing infectious isolates that can neither be differentiated by the clinical symptoms or neuropathological changes they produce nor by the immunobiochemical properties of their associated PrPSc. For this purpose, Syrian hamsters were chosen as model animals because, as outlined above, they have provided key insights into the relationship between phenotypically different TSE strains and PrPSc structure. Second, upon successful identification and passage of such isolates in the hamster model, we investigated whether it is possible to reliably distinguish them and other TSE agents by FT-IR spectroscopic structural characterization of PrP27–30 extracted from the diseased individuals. In the following, we report on an experimental proof-of-concept that FT-IR profiling of PrP27–30 potentially provides a biophysical method for the swift differentiation of TSE agents, including those that are difficult or even impossible to discriminate by a variety of approaches for fast strain typing. Because the model animals used in our study have frequently provided base-line information about natural TSEs, this proof-of-concept may well be indicative of a diagnostic approach that allows the rapid and reliable discrimination of strains in nonexperimental TSEs of animals and humans. TSE Agents and Animal Experiments—Serial passaging of hamster-adapted scrapie strains 263K, ME7-H, and 22A-H and of a new hamster-adapted BSE isolate, BSE-H, was performed by intracerebral infection of outbred Syrian hamsters with 50-μl aliquots of 1% (w/v) hamster-brain homogenates in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, 133 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) from terminally ill donors. Hamster scrapie strain 263K (28Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 34: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) was originally provided by R. H. Kimberlin and has been serially passaged for more than 20 years in our laboratory. Strains ME7-H and 22A-H generated by R.H.

Isolates “RIV/8” of ME7-H and “RIV/12” of 22A-H were used for the first passage of these TSE agents at the Robert Koch-Institute. BSE-H was newly derived in our laboratory after one passage of BSE agent from cattle in mice and subsequent transmission to hamsters. 2A. Thomzig, H. Diringer, and M. Beekes, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, 20-μl aliquots of 1% (w/v) brain tissue homogenate in TBS from a German BSE case in a cow imported from the UK were injected intracerebrally into C57Bl/10 mice; between 529 and 697 days postinfection (dpi), 4/9 recipients succumbed to fatal neurological disease with clinical symptoms strongly reminiscent of murine transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. 50-μl aliquots of 1% (w/v) brain homogenate in TBS from a diseased C57Bl/10 mouse sacrificed at 606 dpi were then intracerebrally inoculated into hamsters. This produced terminal TSE-like symptoms between 360 and 467 dpi in 10/10 animals. For the present study, all examinations were performed on the 2nd serial passages of BSE-H, ME7-H, and 22A-H in our laboratory, which showed incubation times of 287 ± 28, 331 ± 16, and 206 ± 8 days (expressed as mean ± S.D.) until the occurrence of terminal disease, respectively, and on a passage of 263K with an incubation time of 83 ± 5 days. These incubation times remained constant in further serial transmissions (data not shown) indicating stable propagation of BSE-H, ME7-H, and 22A-H after the first passage in our hamsters. Animals were regularly observed for clinical symptoms and humanely sacrificed by CO2 euthanasia at the terminal stage of disease. After sacrificing, the brains were immediately removed and further processed as outlined below. Lesion Profiles—Brains were fixed in 4% formalin for 48 h, treated with formic acid for 60 min at room temperature to reduce infectivity, postfixed in formalin for 24 h, and trimmed coronally into 2–3-mm-thick slices.

For PET blotting according to Schulz-Schaeffer et al. (31Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Tschoke S. Kranefuss N. Drose W. Hause-Reitner D. Giese A. Groschup M.H. Kretzschmar H.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), specimens were washed in TBS, pH 7.8, with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and digested with 25 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Brij 35 for 2 h at 55 °C. Sections were denatured in 3 m guanidine isothiocyanate, blocked in 0.2% (w/v) casein in TBST, and incubated with mouse α-hamster PrP antibody 3F4 (mAb 3F4; 1:2500 (32Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with the secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2000; Dako, Denmark)) for 60 min at room temperature, sections were stained with nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma) to visualize the reaction product. The immunostained PET blots were assessed for cerebral PrPSc distribution using a stereo microscope. For negative controls, brain slices were incubated in normal mouse serum (1:25,000) instead of mAb 3F4 prior to incubation with secondary antibody. Western Blot Typing of PrP27–30—50 μl of 10% (w/v) brain homogenates in TBS, pH 7.4, were mixed with 5 μl of 13% (w/v) Sarkosyl and 10 μl of proteinase K stock solution (1 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) and subsequently digested for 60 min at 37 °C (33Beekes M. Baldauf E. Cassens S. Diringer H. Keyes P. Scott A.C. Wells G.A. Brown P. Gibbs C.J.J. Gajdusek D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The digestion was stopped by adding 435 μl of 2× sample buffer, i.e. 4% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol in 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and boiling for 5 min. 1–5 μl of the solution (corresponding to 1–5 × 10-5 g of homogenized brain tissue) were separated in a 15% SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) or in Tris glycine gels (NOVEX, Invitrogen) and subsequently blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) using the semidry method (Fast-Blot; Biometra). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) low-fat milk powder in TBS for 30 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mAb 3F4 (1:2000) in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS. After washing in TBS and incubation for 60 min at room temperature with the secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS), a biotin-streptavidin kit (Dako, Denmark) for signal enhancement was used (30 min; at room temperature). After washing the membranes in TBS, antibody binding to PrP was visualized using a mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma) as substrate. The relative staining intensities of di-, mono- and nonglycosylated PrP in each sample were determined by densitometry for a graphical representation of the glycosylation profiles; densitometric measurements were performed in triplicate for each blotting membrane with samples from at least four donor animals infected with 263K-, ME7-H-, 22A-H, and BSE-H agent. Assaying the Sensitivity of PrPSc to Proteinase K at Different pH Values—25 μl of 10% (w/v) brain homogenates in TBS from hamsters infected with the four different TSE strains (containing approximately the same amounts of PrPSc) were diluted 1:20 in 50 mm Tris adjusted to pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.4, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, and 10.0. Samples were digested with proteinase K as described above at a protease concentration of 40 μg/ml for 60 min at 37 °C. After stopping the digestion by adding 2× sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, sample aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and PrP immunostaining with mAb 3F4 as described above. FT-IR Spectroscopic Characterization of PrP27–30—263K-, ME7-H-, 22A-H-, and BSE-H-associated proteinase K-resistant prion protein PrP27–30 was purified from the brains of intracerebrally infected Syrian hamsters at the terminal stage of disease, using a protocol published previously by Diringer et al. (35Diringer H. Beekes M. Ozel M. Simon D. Queck I. Cardone F. Pocchiari M. Ironside J.W. Intervirology. 1997; 40: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with some modifications: (i) five hamster brains were used instead of 20 brains as starting material. (ii) At each step of the purification procedure that required centrifugation of samples, new polycarbonate vials were used (26.3-ml polycarbonate tubes; Beckman). (iii) Resuspending of pellets by ultrasonification was carried out in glass instead of polycarbonate tubes in order to avoid contamination of the protein with finely dispersed polycarbonate disintegrated from the tube walls. (iv) The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water adjusted to pH 8.5 with 1 m Tris solution and divided into volumes representing 2, 1, and 0.5 “brain equivalents” (BE), i.e. 2, 1, and 0.5 g of starting brain material, and centrifuged in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge using a TLA-45 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the protein pellets were stored at -20 °C until use. For determination of the total protein content, 0.5 BE were mixed with 50 μl of sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The total protein content was determined by staining with Amido Black as described elsewhere (33Beekes M. Baldauf E. Cassens S. Diringer H. Keyes P. Scott A.C. Wells G.A. Brown P. Gibbs C.J.J. Gajdusek D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The purity of the extracted protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining as described previously (33Beekes M. Baldauf E. Cassens S. Diringer H. Keyes P. Scott A.C. Wells G.A. Brown P. Gibbs C.J.J. Gajdusek D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and PrP27–30 was also visualized by Western blotting using mAb 3F4 as described above (not shown). The amount of total protein in the final fraction was usually in the range of 50–150 μg/5 BEs. FT-IR Spectroscopic Measurements—FT-IR spectra of PrP27–30 were collected with a Bruker IFS28B FT-IR spectrometer. Spectral resolution applied was 4 cm-1; for apodization a Blackman-Harris 3-Term function was applied, and a zero filling factor of 4 was used yielding an encoding interval of ∼1 data point per wave number. For each spectrum 128 scans were co-added and averaged. Transmission/absorption FT-IR spectra were collected and electronically stored between 4000 and 400 wave numbers, while the instrument was continuously purged with dry air to reduce water vapor absorption. The FT-IR spectra were collected in the front measurement channel of an IFS28B FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker Optics GmbH, Germany) equipped with a DTGS detector. For FT-IR measurements of samples in D2O, the protein from 2 BEs (20–60 μg) was resuspended and centrifuged twice using a TLA-45 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of 0.1% Zwittergent 3-14 in D2O (Z/D2O) to obtain a finely dispersed protein suspension. Hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange to equilibrium was obtained after 60 min of incubation at room temperature. Aliquots from the supernatant of the second centrifugation were used to collect reference spectra for digital subtraction from the protein Z/D2O suspension. The spectra of PrP27–30 were obtained from samples resuspended in Z/D2O with a final concentration of ∼10 μg/μl. 1.8 μl were transferred to an IR cell constructed from two CaF2 windows, in one of which a cylindrical cavity with a 6-μm path length was engraved. PrP27–30 samples from three independent purification runs of 263K, ME7-H, 22A-H, and BSE-H were each examined. For comparison and graphical representation, the spectra were vector-normalized between 1600 and 1750 wave numbers to get similar intensities of the bands. Second derivatives were calculated using a 13-point smoothing function. With the study background outlined above, we focused on approaches for the characterization and discrimination of TSE agents that, in principle, would also be applicable for a swift strain differentiation under field conditions. This excluded parameters such as the incubation time or techniques such as strain typing by lesion profiling in mice (7Fraser H. Dickinson A.G. J. Comp. Pathol. 1973; 83: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 17Bruce M.E. Br. Med. Bull. 2003; 66: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) as diagnostic options and produced the following results. Clinical Examination for Neurological and Behavioral Symptoms—Hamsters diseased with 263K scrapie showed head bobbing, generalized tremor, and ataxia of gait. These animals were frequently and persistently in motion, easily irritated by touch and noise, upon which they often twitch, and had difficulties maintaining balance and rising from a supine position. In contrast, clinically ill animals challenged with ME7-H or 22A-H scrapie agent exhibited phlegmatic sluggishness with bradykinesia and kyphosis. Unlike 263K scrapie hamsters, ME7-H- and 22A-H-infected animals were frequently and persistently resting, not obviously irritated by touch or noise, and well able to slowly rise from a supine position until very advanced stages of disease. Head bobbing, generalized tremor, or ataxic gait as in 263K scrapie were not observed, but the animals showed signs of hind limb paralysis. Hamsters diseased with BSE-H were also found to rest frequently and continuously in a kyphotic position and then appeared lethargic. However, in contrast to the phlegmatic sluggishness and apparent unresponsiveness to irritation by touch and noise as observed in ME7-H and 22A-H scrapie, BSE-H hamsters exhibited spontaneous convulsions from a resting position and had an extreme sensibility to touch (especially to the hindlimbs) which easily triggered tetanic responses. When moving, BSE-H hamsters showed ataxia of gait and hind limb paralysis without bradykinesia. Unlike the 263K scrapie hamsters, they were fairly well able to rise from a supine position and did not show head bobbing and generalized tremor. Neurological and behavioral symptoms allowed us to distinguish 263K scrapie and BSE-H from each other as well as both from ME7-H and 22A-H. However, a symptomatic discrimination between the latter two was not possible. Neuropathological Lesion Profiling—Following clinical examination, we analyzed the cerebral lesion profiles caused by 263K, ME7-H, 22A-H, and BSE-H agent. Lesion profiles provide a well"

Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a T-helper 2 cytokine, is a key mediator of airway remodeling in asthma, yet the mechanism through which IL-13 promotes fibroblast growth has not been investigated. In this study, we show that IL-13 stimulates the mitogenesis of mouse, rat, and human lung fibroblasts through release of a soluble mitogen that we identified as PDGF-AA. The IL-13-induced growth of human lung fibroblasts was attenuated by an anti-PDGF-AA neutralizing antibody, and IL-13 stimulated human lung fibroblasts to secrete PDGF-AA. Fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos possessing the lethal Patch mutation, which lack the PDGF-Ralpha, showed no mitogenic response to IL-13. However, Patch cells did exhibit IL-13-induced STAT-6 phosphorylation. Stable transfection of the PDGF-Ralpha into Patch cells restored the growth response to PDGF-AA and IL-13. Through the use of lung fibroblasts from STAT-6-deficient mice, we showed that IL-13-induced PDGF-AA release is STAT-6 dependent, but PDGF-AA-induced growth is STAT-6 independent. Finally, we showed that IL-1beta enhanced IL-13-induced mitogenesis of rat lung fibroblasts through up-regulation of the PDGF-Ralpha. Our findings indicate that IL-13 acts in synergy with IL-1beta to stimulate growth by coordinately up-regulating PDGF-AA and the PDGF-Ralpha, respectively."

Recently, a fraction of the virus incorporated late (L) domain-containing p6gag protein, which has an essential function in the release of viral particles from the cell surface, was reported to be phosphorylated by an unknown virus-associated cellular protein kinase (Muller, B., Patschinsky, T., and Krausslich, H. G. (2002) J. Virol. 76, 1015–1024). The present study demonstrates the contribution of the MAP kinase ERK-2 in p6gag phosphorylation. According to mutational analysis, a single ERK-2-phosphorylated threonine residue, belonging to a highly conserved phosphorylation MAP kinase consensus site, was identified at position 23 within p6gag. Substitution by an alanine of the Thr23 phosphorylable residue within the pNL4.3 molecular clone was found to decrease viral release from various cell types. As observed from electron microscopy experiments, most virions produced from this molecular clone remained incompletely separated from the host cell membrane with an immature morphology and displayed a reduced infectivity in single round infection experiments. Analysis of protein processing by Western blotting experiments revealed an incomplete Pr55gag maturation and a reduction in the virion-associated reverse transcriptase proteins was observed that was not related to differences in intracellular viral protein expression. Altogether, these data suggest that phosphorylation of p6gag protein by virus-associated ERK-2 is involved in the budding stage of HIV-1 life cycle.

As a consequence, a number of these host cell proteins has been found to be incorporated within HIV-1 virions in addition to virus-encoded components (15Ott D.E. Rev. Med.

A specific implication of host cell factors was reported to occur during the late budding stage. Indeed, the Pr55gag precursor protein is transported to the budding site by an unknown mechanism that most likely utilizes host cell factors and associates with the plasma membrane through cotranslational modifications by the cellular myristyl-S-transferase (17Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 523-527Google Scholar, 18Gottlinger H.G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5781-5785Google Scholar). The accumulation of the Pr55gag protein at the plasma membrane then allows its multimerization and is followed by the projection outward of the cell of a spherical budding particle. Recently, the recruitment at the budding site of class E Vps proteins including AIP1/ALIX (19Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E. Gottlinger H.G.

Interactions with Tsg101, mediated via the PTAP motif identified as the L-domain contained within the p6gag region, were demonstrated to be enhanced by ubiquitination of the Pr55gag precursor, suggesting a possible interaction with unknown ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (22Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W.

Soon after the viral particle pinches off and is released in the extracellular compartment, the viral protease becomes activated and the Pr55gag polyprotein is cleaved into MAp17gag, CAp24gag, NCp7gag, and p6gag proteins and p1, p2 spacer peptides. Most of these mature products have also been shown to interact with cellular proteins. As an example, interactions occurring with CAp24gag have been documented as the mechanism directing incorporation into virions of cyclophilin A (26Franke E.K. Luban J. Virology. 1996; 222: 279-282Google Scholar, 27Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Göttlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Google Scholar), a host cell compound that acts as an uncoating factor and participates to the initial uptake of HIV-1 by target cells (28Sherry B. Zybarth G. Alfano M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6771-6785Google Scholar). In addition, a number of these Pr55gag processing products was also suggested to interact with host cell protein kinases as they were found to be phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of the viral MAp17gag by host cell kinase(s) was found to occur at various steps of the HIV-1 replicative cycle. Indeed, the C-terminal phosphorylation of MAp17gag protein during and immediately after virus production was proposed to facilitate the dissociation of the viral matrix protein from the cellular membrane (30Gallay P. Swingler S. Aiken C. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Google Scholar). Additional phosphorylation of MAp17gag by the MAP kinase (MAPK) ERK-2 was proposed to promote membrane dissociation of the reverse transcription complex from the cell membrane at the site of entry, allowing its nuclear translocation (31Bukrinskaya A.G. Ghorpade A. Heinzinger N.K. Smithgall T.E. Lewis R.E. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 367-371Google Scholar, 32Jacque J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Google Scholar). For CAp24gag, three distinct phosphorylation sites on serine residues were identified (33Cartier C. Sivard P. Tranchat C. Decimo D. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19434-19440Google Scholar). As mutations at these sites were observed to block HIV-1 replicative cycle at an early reverse transcription step, CAp24gag phosphorylation was proposed to contribute to the early post-entry step by promoting the dissociation of the viral core. Recently, we observed that CAp24gag interacts with and is phosphorylated by the PKA-Cα subunit that we found to be incorporated within HIV-1 particles (34Cartier C. Hemonnot B. Gay B. Bardy M. Sanchiz C. Devaux C. Briant L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35211-35219Google Scholar). More recently, the proline-rich peptide of 52 amino acids termed p6gag, derived from the C terminus of the Pr55gag precursor, was reported to be the predominant phosphoprotein of HIV-1 and the contribution of one or several virus-associated kinase(s) was hypothesized (35Muller B. Patschinsky T. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1015-1024Google Scholar). Having demonstrated that the cellular MAPK ERK-2 is specifically incorporated within HIV-1 viral particles (36Cartier C. Deckert M. Grangeasse C. Trauger R. Jensen F. Bernard A. Cozzone A. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4832-4837Google Scholar), it remained to investigate its role in p6gag phosphorylation. The present study was thus designed to define the precise contribution of ERK-2 in the phosphorylation of the p6gag viral protein, to determine critical residues phosphorylated within p6gag and to elucidate the involvement of p6gag phosphorylation in the HIV-1 life cycle. As observed from in vitro phosphorylation assays, the p6gag protein and its p15gag precursor were found to be phosphorylated by ERK-2 at the level of a single threonine residue (Thr23) located within a conserved MAPK canonical consensus sequence. By analyzing point mutation of the p6gag protein within a pNL4.3 molecular clone, we observed that substitution of the ERK-2 phosphorylable residue within p6gag leads to the production of immature viruses unable to separate from the host cell membrane. A faint number of particles released from the producing cells was isolated that were found to display altered morphology and size. Such particles were characterized by incomplete maturation of Pr55gag precursors accompanied by modifications in the incorporation of reverse transcriptase subunits. As defined from single round infectivity assays performed in the MAGI indicator cell line, Thr23 mutated virions displayed a reduced infectivity as compared with wild type viruses. Altogether, our data indicate that phosphorylation of a unique site of the p6gag domain by ERK-2 plays a critical role in the late stage of the HIV-1 life cycle, by contributing to the regulation of viral assembly and/or release. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and MAGI cells (37Luukkonen B.G. Fenyo E.M. Schwartz S. Virology. 1995; 206: 854-865Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine. In transfection experiments, cells (3 × 105) were plated in 6-well culture plates and incubated in the presence of viral DNA diluted in ExGen 500 transfection reagent (Euromedex) at a ratio of 6 units/μg of DNA. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on a 14% ProSieve® 50 polyacrylamide gel (FMC), then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) and revealed by immunoblotting using an anti-CAp24gag mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) (ICN), an anti-RT rabbit polyclonal serum (kindly provided by J. L. Darlix, ENS, Lyon, France), or an anti-p6gag polyclonal serum obtained after immunization of rabbits with GST-p6gag fusion protein. Anti-MAp17gag mAb was obtained from Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc., anti-ERK-2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-GST from Amersham Biosciences. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection. Virion Production and Purification—Viral stocks were obtained by transfection of the pNL4.3 HIV-1 molecular clone into 293T cells. Briefly, culture supernatants collected 40 h after transfection were cleared from cellular debris by low-speed centrifugation and filtered on 0.45-μm pore size membranes (Millipore). Virions were sedimented by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose cushions, at 25,000 rpm for 2 h 30 min at 4 °C (SW28 rotor), resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and layered onto the top of an Optiprep velocity gradient (6–20% (w/v) iodixanol; Abcys SA). Centrifugation was run for 3 h at 26,000 × g at 4 °C. Virions were recovered from virus-containing fractions by additional ultracentrifugation at 95,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C (TLA100.2 rotor) and lysed. Additional preparation of a highly purified virus (HIV strain HZ321, from clade A) obtained by multiple density gradient purification from infected HUT78 supernatant (38Trauger R.J. Ferre F. Daigle A.E. Jensen F.C. Moss R.B. Mueller S.H. Richieri S.P. Slade H.B. Carlo D.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 1256-1264Google Scholar) was kindly provided by R. Trauger (Immune Response Corp., Carlsbad, CA). GST Fusion Proteins, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Plasmid Production—p6gag and p15gag sequences were amplified by PCR experiments from the pNL4.3 proviral DNA with 5′-GCGTGGATCCCAGAGCAGAC, 5′-CGGGAATTCTCATTGTGAC and 5′-GCGGATCCCAAAGAAAGACTGTTAAG, 5′-CCGAATTCTTATTGTGACGAGGGGTC oligonucleotide primer pairs, respectively, and cloned in-frame into the pGEX 5X.1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). Vectors encoding GST-p6gag mutants, where codons encoding each serine/threonine residue were replaced by sequences encoding an alanine, and the pNL4.3T23A plasmid were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Gene Editor mutagenesis kit (Promega) and primers are listed in Table I. All mutant sequences were confirmed by sequencing. GST-NCp7gag, GST-MAp17gag, and GST-CAp24gag expression vectors were kindly provided by J. Darlix (ENS, Lyon) and vector encoding GST-Elk was a gift of D. A. Brenner (Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill).Table ISerine/threonine residues in the p6gag sequence encoded by the GST-p6gag plasmid or the pNL4.3T23A molecular clone were replaced by an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis using the Gene Editor mutagenesis kit (Promega) and the corresponding primersPrimerResidue mutatedOligonucleotide sequencePosition in pNL4.3 sequenceS3ASer35′-GCTCTGGTCTGGCCTGGGATCCACGC2126-2151T8AThr85′-CTGGTGGGGCTGCTGGCTCTGGTCTG2142-2167S14ASer145′-CCAAACCTGAAGGCCTCTTCTGGTG2162-2186T21AThr215′-GAGGGAGTTGTTGCCTCTTCCCCAAAG2181-2207T22AThr225′-CTGAGAGGGAGTTGCTGTCTCTTCC2187-2211T23AThr235′-CTGAGAGGGAGCTGTTGTCTCTTCC2187-2211S25ASer255′-CTCCTGCTTCTGAGCGGGAGTTGTTG2198-2220S40ASer405′-AAGAGTGATCTGAGGGCAGCTAAAGG2242-2267S43ASer435′-GCTGCCAAAGAGTGCTCTGAGGGAAG2249-2274S47ASer475′-GACGAGGGGTCGGCGCCAAAGAGTG2261-2285S50ASer505′-TTATTGTGACGCGGGGTCGCTGCCAAAG2265-2292S51ASer515′-TTATTGTGCCGAGGGGTCGCTGCCAAAG.2126-2151pNL4.3T23AThr235′-CTTCTGAGAGGGAGCTGTTGTCTCTT2189-2214 Open table in a new tab In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Viral lysate phosphorylation assays were performed in the presence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and kinase buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm MnCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. When phosphorylation of peptides or GST-fused proteins was assayed, 20 ng of recombinant activated ERK-2 (Stratagene) (39Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Google Scholar) was added to the reaction mixture. Phosphorylated products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Purified cell-free virions were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as follows. Virions were solubilized in buffer containing 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mm dithioerythritol, 40 mm Tris, and protease inhibitor for 2 h on a wheel. Viral lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g. Each sample was added to a rehydratation solution containing 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mm dithioerythritol, bromphenol blue, and 1% Pharmalytes pH 3–10 solution (Amersham Biosciences). Immobiline DryStrips, 18 cm, covering a pH range of 3–10 were allowed to rehydrate in the above solution for 4 h without current and then for 12 h under a 30-V current under low viscosity paraffin oil. Isoelectrofocusing was then performed according to the following voltage/time profile: 500 V for 1 h, 1,000 V for 1 h, linearly increasing the gradient to 8,000 V for 2 h, and a final phase of 8,000 V for 40,000 V/h up to a total amount of 50,000 V/h. After the first dimensional run, the individual strip was equilibrated, and then put on the top of the second dimensional gel (15%) with the Hofer Dalt System (Amersham Biosciences) at 150 V/10 gels. Proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride, hybridized with anti-p6gag serum and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and revealed with ECL reagents. Viral Infectivity Assays—MAGI indicator cells, which stably express the β-galactosidase reporter gene cloned downstream of the HIV-1 LTR promoter, were platted at 8 × 104 cells per well, in 24-well plates and exposed to HIV-1 stock solutions normalized according to the CAp24gag antigen content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Beckman-Coulter) or to RT activity determined as previously reported (40Briant L. Benkirane M. Girard M. Hirn M. Iosef C. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5213-5220Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours post-infection, viral infectivity was monitored by quantification of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolysis from the cell lysates as previously described (41Briant L. Robert-Hebmann V. Sivan V. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1875-1885Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity evaluated by measuring absorbance at 410 nm was normalized according to total protein content in the cell lysate. Electron Microscopy Analysis—Transfected 293T cells were processed for thin-layer electron microscopy as follows: 40 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in situ with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were then post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide, washed in cacodylate buffer containing 0.5% tanic acid, and embedded in epon (Embed-812, Electron Microscopy Sciences Inc.). Cell-free virions sedimented by ultracentrifugation for 10 min at 95,000 × g were fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). After extensive washes in 0.1 m Sorensen phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), viruses were included in a fibrin clot as described by Charret and Fauré-Fremiet (42Charret R. Fauré-Fremiet E. J. Microscopie. 1967; 6: 1063-1066Google Scholar). Viruses were then post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% tannic acid, dehydrated, and embedded in epon. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with an Hitachi H7100 transmission electron microscope. ERK-2 Knock-out Experiments—ERK-2 knock-out was performed by transfection of specific siRNA using the MAPK1(ERK-2) siRNA/siAb assay kit (Dharmacon RNA Technologies). Briefly, 100 pmol of pooled siRNA duplexes specific for the erk-2 sequence or control siRNA duplexes were transfected into 293T cells using the OligofectAMINE transfection reagent at a ratio of 1 μl for 20 pmol of siRNA. Inhibition of ERK-2 expression was assayed by immunoblotting of the total cell extracts using anti-ERK-2 mAbs. p6gag Protein and Its p15gag Precursor Are Phosphorylated by ERK-2 Virus-associated Kinase—The p6gag protein was recently shown to be phosphorylated in vivo and the possible contribution of virus-associated kinase(s) in these phosphorylation events was evoked (35Muller B. Patschinsky T. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1015-1024Google Scholar). To investigate such hypothesis, a lysate of highly purified NL4.3 virions was incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and appropriate kinase buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1A, several phosphoproteins evidenced and their nature were investigated by probing the membrane with antibodies raised against HIV-1 proteins. In these experimental conditions, phosphorylated products at 55 and 6 kDa were revealed by using anti-p6gag serum. This observation indicates that the p6gag protein and its Pr55gag precursor are both phosphorylated by host cell protein kinase(s) incorporated within HIV-1 particles. The contribution of host cell contaminating constituents was excluded as similar data were obtained using immunogen grade preparations of HIV strain HZ321 as a substrate (38Trauger R.J. Ferre F. Daigle A.E. Jensen F.C. Moss R.B. Mueller S.H. Richieri S.P. Slade H.B. Carlo D.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 1256-1264Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, 24- and 17-kDa phosphorylated proteins were recognized, respectively, with anti-CAp24gag and anti-MAp17gag mAbs, specific for processed forms of these proteins. This observation corroborates previous literature data indicating that MAp17gag and CAp24gag were phosphorylated by virus-associated kinases (32Jacque J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Google Scholar, 34Cartier C. Hemonnot B. Gay B. Bardy M. Sanchiz C. Devaux C. Briant L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35211-35219Google Scholar). In agreement with our published observations (36Cartier C. Deckert M. Grangeasse C. Trauger R. Jensen F. Bernard A. Cozzone A. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4832-4837Google Scholar), an additional 42-kDa phosphorylated protein, which we previously identified as the host cell ERK-2 protein kinase incorporated within HIV-1 particles, was also observed from these phosphorylation experiments. We next investigated the contribution of ERK-2 in p6gag phosphorylation. GST fusion proteins containing the sequences encoding the p6gag protein or its p15gag precursor (see Fig. 1C, lower panel for its composition) were generated and used in an in vitro phosphorylation experiment in the presence of recombinant activated ERK-2 protein kinase (i.e. dually phosphorylated on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 residues). As shown in Fig. 1B, the GST-p15gag precursor and GST-p6gag proteins were found to be phosphorylated. Interestingly, a stronger phosphorylation signal was detected with GST-p15gag compared with GST-p6gag. In contrast, no phosphorylation was observed using GST-NCp7gag or GST-CAp24gag as a substrate. As previously reported by others (32Jacque J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Google Scholar), ERK-2-dependent phosphorylation of GST-MAp17gag was observed in our experimental conditions. GST alone and GST-Elk, a natural substrate of ERK-2, are shown as negative and positive controls, respectively. The amount of GST fusion proteins loaded in each lane was ascertained by Western blotting of the membrane with anti-GST mAb. Altogether, our results indicate that the p6gag protein packaged into virions is phosphorylated and suggest the contribution of ERK-2 virus-associated protein kinase as demonstrated by in vitro experiments. These phosphorylations are susceptible to occur before the complete processing of p6gag as suggested by the observation of phosphorylated forms of Pr55gag and p15gag precursors. A Single ERK-2 Consensus Sequence within the p6gag Protein Is Targeted by ERK-2—To define which amino acid residue(s) of p6gag is/are phosphorylated by the ERK-2 recombinant protein, the presence of the ERK-2 consensus motives was scanned in the total p6gag sequence. A single canonical ERK-2 motif represented by the (Ser/Thr)-Pro minimal sequence was identified at position 23 of the p6gag protein encoded by the pNL4.3 molecular clone. According to the compilation of HIV-1 sequences listed in the NIAID data base (43Kuiken C.L. Foley B. Hahn B. Korber B. McCutchan F. Marx P.A. Mellors J.W. Mullins J.I. Sodroski J. Wolinksy S. Biology Theoretical Group Biophysics Human Retroviruses and AIDS (1999). A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1999Google Scholar), this motif was found to be conserved in most HIV-1 consensus sequences with a duplication observed in the consensus from clades M, F, and H (see Table II). In some cases (clades A and G), the Thr-Pro motif was absent but an equivalent Ser-Pro motif was found immediately beside, suggesting that a strong selection pressure leads to the conservation of an ERK-2 consensus at this site. ERK-2-dependent phosphorylation of the Thr23 residue was then analyzed in an in vitro phosphorylation assay using synthetic peptides mimicking either wild type (WT) p6gag spanning residues 12–39, or an equivalent peptide with an alanine replacing the threonine residue at position 23 (T23A) (Fig. 2A) incubated in the presence of recombinant activated ERK-2. As shown in Fig. 2B, phosphorylation of the WT peptide was evidenced from 0.3 to 15 nmol of peptide. In contrast, no phosphorylation signal was observed with equivalent amounts of T23A mutated peptide. These data indicate that residue Thr23 accounts for ERK-2-dependent phosphorylation of a p6gag peptide spanning residues 12 to 39. The existence of additional ERK-2 phosphorylation site(s) in p6gag was next analyzed. A systematic mutational analysis was performed to modify each serine or threonine residue within the p6gag sequence into an alanine residue. WT or mutated p6gag proteins were expressed in-frame with the GST sequence and used in an in vitro kinase experiment. As shown in Fig. 2C, p6gag protein was found to be phosphorylated when incubated with catalytically active ERK-2. ERK-2-dependent phosphorylation of p6gag was totally abolished only when the Thr23 residue was mutated into an alanine. No modification of GST-p6gag phosphorylation was observed when other serine or threonine residues within p6gag were substituted. Thus, the threonine residue at position 23 within p6gag appears to be the unique residue of this protein targeted by recombinant activated ERK-2 in vitro.Table IIConsequences of p6gagvariability on Pol sequence Open table in a new tab Fig. 2In vitro phosphorylation analysis of WT and mutated p6gag peptides and GST-fused p6gag protein.A, amino a"
https://openalex.org/W1993524190,"Mitogenic activation of expression of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos, is controlled through signal-induced phosphorylation of constitutively bound transcription factors that is correlated with a nucleosomal response that involves inducible chromatin modifications, such as histone phosphorylation and acetylation. Here we have explored a potential role for the transcription factor NF-κB and its associated signaling components in mediating induction of c-fos gene expression downstream of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent signaling. Here we show that EGF treatment of quiescent fibroblast does not induce the classical pathway of NF-κB activation through IκB kinase (IKK)-directed IκBα phosphorylation. Interestingly, efficient induction of c-fos transcription requires IKKα, one of the subunits of the IκB kinase complex. The NF-κB subunit, p65/RelA, is found constitutively associated with the c-fos promoter, and knock-out of this transcription factor significantly reduces c-fos gene expression. Importantly, EGF induces the recruitment of IKKα to the c-fos promoter to regulate promoter-specific histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation in a manner that is independent of p65/RelA. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IKKα and p65/RelA contribute significantly to EGF-induced c-fos gene expression in a manner independent of the classical, IκBα degradation, p65/RelA nuclear accumulation response pathway.

NF-κB is a widely studied dimeric transcription factor that is inducible by inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and other regulatory stimuli (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar, 2Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Google Scholar, 3Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Google Scholar, 4Yamamoto Y.

The five members of the mammalian NF-κB family are RelA/p65, c-Rel, p50/NF-κB1, p52/NF-κB2, and RelB. Control of NF-κB activation is generally considered to be at the level of release from the IκB inhibitory proteins, which maintain NF-κB largely in the cytoplasmic compartment. Following exposure of cells to inflammatory cytokines, the IκB kinase (IKK) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; SRE, serum response element; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; SRF, serum response factor; MSK, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase. complex is activated and phosphorylates IκB proteins on N-terminal serines leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. This process frees NF-κB to accumulate in the nucleus and to associate with specific gene regulatory regions to control gene expression (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar, 2Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Google Scholar, 3Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Google Scholar, 4Yamamoto Y.

The IKK complex contains two highly conserved catalytic subunits, namely IKKα and IKKβ, of which IKKβ appears to be the dominant kinase controlling IκB phosphorylation downstream of cytokine-induced signaling (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar, 3Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Google Scholar). However little to no information exists regarding direct roles for IKK or NF-κB in controlling growth factor-induced gene expression. EGF family members interact with receptors belonging to the EGF receptor family, including EGF receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor family protein (ErbB)2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (6Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar). Interaction of these signaling molecules with the receptors initiates intracellular signaling cascades that lead to activation of a number of transcription factors such as AP-1 and STATs (7Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that EGF induces NF-κB nuclear levels in cell types such as A431 cells and in several breast cancer cell lines that overexpress EGF receptor (8Biswas D. Cruz A. Gansberger E. Pardee A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8542-8547Google Scholar). However, it remains inconclusive whether EGF signaling to NF-κB occurs in EGF receptor-normalized cell lines such as fibroblasts, and relevant gene targets are unknown. The immediate early genes (including c-fos,c-jun, and c-myc) are characterized by their rapid inducibility in response to a variety of signals, including mitogenic stimulation (9Clayton A. Mahadevan L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 51-58Google Scholar). c-fos has been the most extensively studied of this group of genes relative to induction of gene expression, with evidence demonstrating the involvement of sequence-specific transcription factors and associated co-factors controlling transcription induction in a manner dependent on the activation of upstream signal transduction cascades (10Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Google Scholar, 11Janknecht R. Ernst W. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Google Scholar, 12Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M. Shaw P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Google Scholar). A key regulatory element in the c-fos promoter is the serum response element (SRE), which interacts in a constitutive manner with the serum response ternary complex containing SRF, Elk-1, and the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 (10Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Google Scholar, 11Janknecht R. Ernst W. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Google Scholar, 14Li Q. Yang S. Maeda Y. Sladek F. Sharrocks A. Martins-Green M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 281-291Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of Elk-1 by MAPKs leads to the activation of the ternary complex-associated CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase co-activator (14Li Q. Yang S. Maeda Y. Sladek F. Sharrocks A. Martins-Green M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 281-291Google Scholar). Additionally, the c-fos promoter undergoes inducible histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation following mitogenic stimulation that correlates with immediate-early gene induction (15Chadee N. Hendzel M. Tylipski C. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D. Wright J. Davie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Google Scholar, 16Clayton A. Rose S. Barratt M. Mahadevan L.

The kinase that controls histone H3 phosphorylation downstream of mitogen-induced signaling has been proposed to be either MSK1/2 or ribosomal S6 Kinase 2 (18Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Google Scholar, 19Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggen G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Google Scholar). More recent evidence supports the role of MSK1/2 in controlling this response (18Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Google Scholar). Recently we and others (20Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.-T. Gaynor R. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar) described IKKα as a critical kinase involved in controlling TNF-induced H3 Ser10 phosphorylation at certain NF-κB-dependent promoters in a manner dependent on the recruitment of RelA/p65 to the promoters. Here we have analyzed the potential involvement of the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB and IKKα in controlling EGF-induced c-fos gene expression. Cells and Reagents—IKK wild-type, IKKα–/–, and IKKβ–/– MEFs were provided by I. Verma and M. Karin. IKKα reconstituted MEFs (IKKα+/+) were provided by E. Dejardin and D. Green. Antibodies against IκBα, CBP, tubulin, and mouse IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz. The p65/RelA-specific antibody was obtained from Rockland, Inc. Antibodies specific for IKKα, phospho-Ser10-H3 and acetyl-H3 at Lys9 or Lys14 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-Elk-1 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. EGF (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was used at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP analysis was performed following a protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. under modified conditions and as previously described (20Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar). The following promoter-specific primers were used; primer pair CACGGCCGGTCCCTGTTGTTC and GTCGCGGTTGGAGTAGTAGGCG was used to amplify the proximal region of the c-fos promoter. The primers for β-globin are CAGCATGTGCTGAGGACTTGG and ACTGCCTTCAGAGAATCGCCC. Quantitative real time PCR was performed in triplicate to determine the association of phospho-Ser10-H3, acetyl-Lys9-H3, and acetyl-Lys14 with the c-fos promoter by using the above oligonucleotide primers and input DNA standards diluted in 3-fold increment from 10 to 0.01% with SYBR Green Master Mix and the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from MEF, IKKα–/–, IKKα+/+, IKKβ–/–, or p65–/– cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For real time PCR, the cDNA was prepared with random primers (Invitrogen) and analyzed in triplicate with the SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen) for 15 min at 95 °C for initial denaturing, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 63 °C for 30 s in the ABI sequence detection system. The oligonucleotide primers used to analyzed IκBα transcripts contained the sequences 5′-GATCCGCCAGGTGAAGGG-3′ and 5′-GCAATTTCTGGCTGGTTGG-3′. Primers used to analyze the c-fos and 18 S ribosomal RNAs were obtained using an Ambion gene-specific relative reverse transcription-PCR kit with the suggested conditions. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed after preparing nuclear, cytoplasmic, or whole cell extracts and separating proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies as indicated. Extractions of acid-soluble proteins were done according to the protocol described by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and resolved on 10–20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels. Analysis of the Classical NF-κB Activation Pathway in Response to EGF Stimulation of MEFs—It has previously been reported that EGF induces NF-κB nuclear levels in cell types that overexpress EGF receptor, such as A431 cells and certain breast cancer cell lines (8Biswas D. Cruz A. Gansberger E. Pardee A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8542-8547Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether EGF signaling activates the classical NF-κB pathway in cells that do not express high levels of the EGF receptor. Thus, EGF-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts were analyzed for the characteristic degradation of IκBα and nuclear accumulation of the p65 NF-κB subunit typically associated with the TNF response. MEFs were stimulated with EGF and assayed for degradation of IκBα through Western blot analysis. Interestingly, EGF did not result in any significant level of IκBα degradation (Fig. 1A). Additionally, analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from EGF-treated MEFs did not reveal detectable nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. 1B), although similar analysis using TNF results in strong IκBα degradation and p65 nuclear accumulation (Ref. 20Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar and data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports indicating that maximal nuclear accumulation of p65 is largely dependent on IKK-directed IκBα phosphorylation. We previously reported that the subcellular localization of IKKα in unstimulated MEFs is both nuclear and cytoplasmic and that IKKα undergoes a nuclear translocation event in response to TNFα stimulation (20Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar). To determine whether EGF induces a similar response, IKKα levels were examined in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts by Western analysis. Similar to p65, nuclear levels of IKKα remained unchanged in response to EGF (Fig. 1B). NF-κB DNA binding potential, analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, did not show any appreciable increase in response to EGF (data not shown). Additionally, real time PCR analysis of wild-type MEFs demonstrated only a modest induction of expression of the NF-κB-dependent IκBα gene in response to EGF in contrast to the stronger inducible profile observed for induction of c-fos gene expression (Fig. 1C). In contrast, TNF strongly activated the IκBα gene and only weakly induced c-fos gene expression (Fig. 1D), as previously reported (22Li X. Massa P.E. Hanidu A. Peet G.W. Aro P. Savitt A. Mische S. Li J. Marcu K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45129-45140Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that EGF does not activate the classical NF-κB activation pathway in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. IKKα Is Required for Optimal EGF-induced c-fos Gene Expression—Previously, we had found that IKKα contributes to cytokine-induced gene expression. Thus, we addressed whether the loss of IKKα has an observable affect on c-fos gene expression in response to EGF. Analysis of c-fos gene expression was measured by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2A) and independently by quantitative real time PCR analysis (Fig. 2B) in wild-type MEFs and MEFs deficient for either IKKα or IKKβ. MEFs were maintained in low serum (0.5% fetal bovine serum) for 48 h followed by EGF stimulation for the indicated times to induce c-fos gene expression. As expected, wild-type MEFs exhibited rapid induction of c-fos mRNA with peak levels occurring 15 min after EGF stimulation, which decreased by the 1-h time point (Fig. 2). Interestingly, induction of c-fos in IKKα–/– MEFs was considerably reduced and more transient following EGF stimulation (Fig. 2). Although induction of c-fos was reduced at the 15-min time point in IKKβ–/– cells, the levels were more comparable with wild-type cells following 30 min of EGF stimulation (Fig. 2). Restoration of IKKα-deficient cells with wild-type IKKα (IKKα+/+) resulted in strong c-fos expression following EGF treatment (Fig. 2B). The enhanced level of c-fos gene expression in the IKKα+/+ MEFs is likely due to the relatively high expression of reconstituted IKKα in these cells (data not shown). Additionally, a similar requirement for IKKα in the inducible regulation of two other immediate-early genes, c-myc and Fra-2, was observed (data not shown). These data provide evidence that IKKα is required for optimal EGF-induced c-fos gene expression. The Loss of IKKα Does Not Affect EGF-induced Signaling Pathways—One possible mechanism for the reduction of c-fos gene expression observed in the IKKα–/– MEFs may involve inhibition of EGF-induced signaling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the effect of EGF on MAPK activation in IKKα-deficient cells by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies. Treatment of wild-type MEFs with EGF resulted in the induction of MEK1/2 phosphorylation within 10 min and decreased after 30 min (Fig. 3A). Induction of MEK1/2 phosphorylation in IKKα–/– MEFs was similar to wild-type MEFs with slight kinetic differences in activation (Fig. 3A). MAPK-directed phosphorylation of Elk-1 was analyzed by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific Elk-1 antibody. Inducible and transient levels of Elk-1 phosphorylation were detected in both wild-type and IKKα-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3B). These results indicate no significant defect in MAPK activation in IKKα–/– cells and suggest that the altered induction in c-fos gene expression in IKKα–/– cells is downstream of MAPK activation, specifically at the level of c-fos gene regulation. Recruitment of IKKα to the Endogenous c-fos Promoter Is Enhanced in Response to EGF—Prior studies have correlated enhanced H3 Ser10 phosphorylation with transcriptional induction of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos and c-myc, upon mitogenic treatment (15Chadee N. Hendzel M. Tylipski C. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D. Wright J. Davie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Google Scholar, 16Clayton A. Rose S. Barratt M. Mahadevan L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Google Scholar, 17Cheung P. Tanner K. Cheung W. Sasson-Corsi P. Denu J. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Google Scholar, 19Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggen G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Google Scholar). However, the promoter association of potential H3 Ser10 kinases has not been explored. Thus, we investigated whether IKKα is recruited to the c-fos promoter in response to EGF in a manner associated with specific histone modifications. Specifically, MEFs were maintained for 48 h in 0.5% serum. Quiescent cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for various times, DNA and protein was cross-linked with formaldehyde, and DNA was sonicated to shear chromatin into average fragments of ∼1 kb. Subsequently, protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using antibodies that specifically recognize phospho-Ser10 histone H3, acetyl-Lys9-H3, or acetyl-Lys14-H3 in parallel with an IKKα-specific antibody. DNA recovered from the antibody-bound fractions as well as the DNA from input chromatin (input) were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR using primers specific for the proximal region of the c-fos promoter. The specificity for all ChIP assays was demonstrated both by the absence of c-fos amplification in the mock samples immunoprecipitated with or without an irrelevant antibody, IgG, and by analysis of the transcriptionally inactive β-globin locus (data not shown). In wild-type MEFs, stimulation with EGF led to an increase of H3 Ser10 phosphorylation at the c-fos promoter, with peak levels occurring at the 10-min time point that declined to unstimulated levels 1 h following EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A, left panel). In contrast to H3 Ser10 phosphorylation, acetylation of H3 at Lys9 and Lys14 was detected in unstimulated cells with a modest increase detected following EGF stimulation. Interestingly, association of IKKα with the c-fos promoter was detectable at low levels in unstimulated cells and increased transiently in response to EGF, with enhanced association occurring after 10 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 4A, left panel). This analysis demonstrates that IKKα association with the c-fos promoter correlates with induced H3 Ser10 phosphorylation levels in quiescent MEFs stimulated with EGF. IKKα Is Required for EGF-induced H3 Ser10 Phosphorylation at the c-fos Promoter—To determine whether IKKα is required for EGF-stimulated H3 Ser10 phosphorylation at the c-fos promoter, ChIP assays were performed using quiescent IKKα–/– MEFs. In contrast to wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4A, left panel), enrichment for H3 Ser10 phosphorylation at the c-fos promoter was undetected in IKKα–/– MEFs following EGF treatment (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Additionally, the kinetic profiles of Lys9- and Lys14-acetylated H3 were similar to wild-type cells; however, reduced levels of acetylated H3 at Lys19 or Lys14 were detected in IKKα–/– cells. Next, quantification of ChIP DNA by real time PCR was performed to measure the amount of c-fos genomic DNA that co-immunoprecipitated with the specific histone modifications in wild-type and IKKα–/– cells relative to total input chromatin. These results show that in IKKα–/– MEFs, H3 Ser10 phosphorylation levels are quantitatively reduced most significantly after 10 min of EGF treatment with more comparable levels to wild type at later time points (Fig. 4B). Both Lys9- and Lys14-acetylated H3 show modest induction in response to EGF in wild-type MEFs. However, induction and overall levels of acetylated H3 are reduced in IKKα–/– MEFs (Figs. 4, C and D). Next, to more directly address a potential requirement for IKKα in modulating H3 Ser10 phosphorylation at the c-fos promoter, ChIP assays were performed using IKKα-null MEFs where wild-type IKKα was restored via stable expression (indicated as IKKα+/+). ChIP assays revealed that H3 Ser10 phosphorylation levels were restored in response to EGF in IKKα+/+ MEFs with slight differences in kinetics as compared with wild-type cells, with peak levels occurring after 15 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 4A, right panel). The kinetic profile of IKKα recruitment was delayed as compared with wild type with peak levels of promoter-associated IKKα detected after 15 min of EGF treatment. Additionally, the kinetic profiles for Lys9- and Lys14-acetylated H3 were comparable with wild-type MEFs. Overall, the recruitment of IKKα at the c-fos promoter coincided with and was required for promoter-associated H3 Ser10 phosphorylation following EGF treatment. IKKα Controls Global Levels of EGF-induced Phosphorylation of Histone H3 on Ser10—To address whether IKKα plays a broader role in regulating global levels of histone H3 phosphorylation, core histones were acid-extracted from EGF-treated wild-type MEFs or IKKα-deficient cells (IKKα–/–) and examined by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific to phospho-histone H3 (Ser10). As expected, wild-type MEFs exhibit inducible H3 Ser10 phosphorylation in response to EGF in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). This histone modification was visible within 15 min after the addition of EGF with overall levels decreasing between 30 and 60 min post-induction. Although H3 Ser10 phosphorylation levels in IKKα–/– MEFs were similar to wild type after 15 min of EGF treatment, overall levels were lost at the later time points (Fig. 4E). IKKα+/+ MEFs, in which functional IKKα was stably expressed in IKKα–/– cells, result in restored levels of phosphorylated Ser10 levels with similar kinetics as wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4E). Global levels of EGF-induced histone H3 acetylation at Lys9 and Lys14 were slightly reduced in IKKα–/– cells as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4E). These data support a role for IKKα in modulating global levels of histone H3 phosphorylation on Ser10 in response to mitogenic (EGF) stimuli. p65/RelA Is Constitutively Associated with the c-fos Promoter and Contributes to the Induction of c-fos Gene Expression— Transcriptional regulation of c-fos is controlled by cis-acting elements in the promoter regions, including the SRE and the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (see Ref. 23Murai K. Treisman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7083-7092Google Scholar and references therein). Full activation of the c-fos SRE requires association with the ubiquitous transcription factor SRF and formation of a complex with ternary complex factors, including the Ets family of transcription factor Elk-1 (10Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Google Scholar). Additionally, transactivation by these nuclear factors is facilitated by CBP/p300 (14Li Q. Yang S. Maeda Y. Sladek F. Sharrocks A. Martins-Green M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 281-291Google Scholar). In terms of NF-κB-dependent promoter assembly, previous reports have demonstrated that IKKα interacts with CBP; however, recruitment of CBP to NF-κB-dependent promoters is not dependent on IKKα (21Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.-T. Gaynor R. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar). In addition, utilizing p65–/– MEFs, the p65 subunit was shown to be required for IKKα association with NF-κB-regulated promoters following TNF stimulation (20Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.-T. Gaynor R. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar). To explore the mode of recruitment for IKKα to the c-fos promoter, ChIP assays were performed using antibodies against p65 and CBP. In wild-type MEFs, p65 was detected at the c-fos promoter in unstimulated cells, and this remained relatively unchanged following EGF stimulation (Fig. 5A, left panel). A similar profile of p65 association with the c-fos promoter was observed in IKKα–/– MEFs (Fig. 5A, right panel). Consistent with previous reports (see Ref. 14Li Q. Yang S. Maeda Y. Sladek F. Sharrocks A. Martins-Green M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 281-291Google Scholar and references therein); CBP is found constitutively associated with the c-fos promoter in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 5A, left panel). Additionally, CBP recruitment was unaltered in cells deficient for IKKα (Fig. 5A, right panel). p65 was not found associated with the β-globin promoter (data not shown), indicating the specificity of the ChIP assays. These data indicate that p65 is preassociated with the c-fos promoter in an IKKα-independent manner. To explore a potential role for p65 at the c-fos gene promoter, quantitative real time PCR analysis was used to measure c-fos gene expression in p65–/– MEFs following EGF treatment. p65–/– MEFs exhibited a marked defect in c-fos gene induction after EGF treatment in contrast to wild-type MEFs that show rapid induction of c-fos mRNA within 15 min of EGF stimulation (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that p65 may play a direct regulatory role in controlling c-fos gene expression or may facilitate promoter-associated IKKα or other factors to stimulate gene expression. Association of IKKα at the c-fos Promoter Occurs Independently of the p65 NF-κB Subunit—The data described above raise the question of whether p65 is required for the association of IKKα with the c-fos promoter. To address this point, ChIP assays were performed in p65–/– MEFs. Quiescent p65–/– MEFs were left untreated or were treated with EGF along a time course followed by ChIP analysis with antibodies against IKKα or phospho-Ser10 histone H3. Our data demonstrate inducible levels of H3 Ser10 phosphorylation in response to EGF, with peak levels after 15 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, peak levels of promoter-associated IKKα were detected after 10 min of EGF treatment, indicating that recruitment of IKKα at the c-fos promoter is p65-independent (Fig. 5C). The results were confirmed by quantification of ChIP DNA by real time PCR to measure the amount of c-fos genomic DNA that co-immunoprecipitated with the H3 Ser10 phosphorylation levels in p65–/– MEFs as well as wild-type MEFs relative to total input chromatin (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that EGF-induced recruitment of IKKα to the c-fos promoter occurs independently of p65/RelA. The results presented in this report indicate that IKKα is a critical regulator of mitogenic-induced H3 Ser10 phosphorylation, at least for the c-fos promoter. The data also support previously published work regarding the association between inducible phosphorylation and acetylation at certain promoters (17Cheung P. Tanner K. Cheung W. Sasson-Corsi P. Denu J. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Google Scholar), whereby the loss of H3 Ser10 phosphorylation reduces but does not eliminate inducible levels of acetylation of histone H3 in IKKα–/– MEFs. However, we do not exclude the possibility that these dynamic modifications occur independently as previously reported for the c-jun promoter (24Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 6: 1231-1241Google Scholar). In addition to these dynamic modifications, interplay among other modifications, such as histone H3 methylation, may differentially contribute to c-fos gene regulation either positively or negatively (25Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Google Scholar, 26Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Google Scholar). The experiments also provide an interesting regulatory model whereby NF-κB controls gene expression in a manner that is independent of inducible promoter association of the NF-κB subunit, p65/RelA. Evidence that IKKα controls c-fos histone H3 phosphorylation and inducible gene expression led us to address the potential association of the p65 NF-κB subunit with the c-fos promoter, because it was previously found that IKKα association with certain cytokine-regulated promoters was dependent on the recruitment of p65 (20Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.-T. Gaynor R. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar). Our current studies indicate that p65 is found constitutively associated with c-fos promoter. In this regard, the association of p65 with the c-fos promoter occurs in a manner that is similar to other c-fos regulatory factors (such as SRF) and that is different from the traditional mechanism of NF-κB regulation. Although others have observed the classical NF-κB activation response in cells that express high levels of EGF receptor (8Biswas D. Cruz A. Gansberger E. Pardee A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8542-8547Google Scholar), at least in quiescent MEFs, we did not observe any significant degradation of IκBα or nuclear accumulation of p65 following treatment with EGF. Interestingly, p65 contributed to the induced levels of c-fos gene expression following EGF treatment of quiescent MEFs (Fig. 5B). Thus, the role of the p65 subunit in controlling EGF-induced gene expression is not dependent on the enhanced recruitment of this transcription factor with its gene target. However, the mode of p65 activation downstream of EGF and the role that p65 plays in regulating c-fos gene expression are presently unclear. The basis for the association of p65 with the c-fos promoter is unknown. Previous studies have suggested that p65 might participate in regulating the transcriptional activity of SRF, and a physical interaction was reported between p65 and SRF in vitro (27Franzoso G. Carlson L. Brown K. Daucher M. Bressler P. Siebenlist U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3403-3412Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that p65 is constitutively associated with the c-fos promoter through interactions with SRF. Additionally, we identified a previously uncharacterized NF-κB consensus site in the c-fos promoter (positions –214 to –223). The position of the region amplified with c-fos promoter-specific primer pairs used in the PCR step of the ChIP assays includes this putative NF-κB site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays did not detect NF-κB DNA binding to this site in the c-fos promoter (data not shown), suggesting that this site is not a high affinity site for p65 in vitro and supports the possibility that p65 may function in concert with other nuclear factors at this promoter in vivo. Possibilities for promoter-associated p65 include cooperative interactions with SRF resulting in the formation of higher transcriptional complexes, as described above. In fact, antibodies to p65 (but not to p50) can partially supershift an SRF/SRE complex using a gel mobility shift assay (data not shown). Although the importance of chromatin modification, including histone phosphorylation, in regulating gene expression is well recognized (28Strahl B. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 401: 41-45Google Scholar, 29Berger S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3007-3013Google Scholar, 30Narlikar G. Fan H. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar), the regulation of and identity of factors that control these modifications often remain unclear. Recent evidence, using MSK1/2 double knock-out MEFs, indicate that MSK proteins control global levels of H3 Ser10 phosphorylation as well as inducible H3 Ser10 phosphorylation at the c-jun promoter in response to mitogenic or stress stimuli (19Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggen G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Google Scholar). Furthermore, our studies and those of Soloaga et al. (19Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggen G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Google Scholar) indicate that the loss of inducible H3 Ser10 phosphorylation results in deficient c-fos gene expression levels. It is intriguing to speculate that this reduction may reflect the contribution of H3 Ser10 phosphorylation to immediate early gene expression. However, MSK1/2 and IKKα may play other roles in controlling c-fos gene expression. For example, MSK1 may play a role in activating the function of p65 at the c-fos promoter, because it has been proposed that MSK1 controls the phosphorylation of p65 on Ser276 (31Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vandern Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Google Scholar), an event important in the interaction of p65 with co-activators, such as CBP (32Zhong H. May M. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Google Scholar). This concept could reflect a role for p65 and for MSK at the c-fos promoter in controlling expression of immediate-early genes. Longer term experimentation is directed toward understanding the complex regulatory network involving MSK1/2 and IKKα in controlling chromatin modification and ultimately inducible gene expression. The loss of p65 did not affect promoter-associated IKKα or EGF-induced H3 Ser10 phosphorylation at the c-fos promoter (Fig. 5C). This result was surprising as compared with our previous findings and those by Yamamoto et al. (21Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.-T. Gaynor R. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar) where recruitment of IKKα to cytokine-inducible promoters is required the presence of p65. Thus, the mechanism of IKKα recruitment to the c-fos promoter could be dependent on the presence of another NF-κB subunit or via interactions with a distinct factor. It is important to note that IKKα interacts with the transcriptional co-activator CBP (21Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.-T. Gaynor R. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Google Scholar) and that this interaction may underlie promoter recruitment. In this regard, MAPK-directed phosphorylation of Elk-1 that stabilizes CBP/p300 interactions with the SRE ternary complex (14Li Q. Yang S. Maeda Y. Sladek F. Sharrocks A. Martins-Green M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 281-291Google Scholar) may also lead to enhanced association of IKKα with the c-fos promoter. Collectively, our findings provide the first evidence that promoter association of IKKα can occur in a p65-independent manner and that both IKKα and p65 contribute to EGF-induced c-fos gene expression. In this regard, IKKα has been shown to control keratinocyte differentiation in a manner that is independent of NF-κB (33Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K. Yoshida Y. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Google Scholar). Additionally, IKKα knock-out mice exhibited skin and skeletal abnormalities (34Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang S. Buscher D. Lee K. Izpisua-Belmonte J. Verma I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Google Scholar), consistent with the effect on keratinocyte differentiation. Overall, our results indicate that both IKKα and p65 contribute toward maximal EGF-induced c-fos gene expression, potentially through distinct mechanisms. This is consistent with previous reports highlighting the complexity of c-fos gene regulation through multiple promoter-bound factors and/or specific signaling pathways (10Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Google Scholar). We thank Dr. M. Karin and Dr. I. Verma for kindly providing the IKK wild-type, IKKα–/–, and IKKβ–/– MEFs, and Dr. E. Dejardin and Dr. D.

Here we report the identification and characterization of a new member of this family, glacontryphan-M from the venom of Conus marmoreus. This is the first known example of a contryphan peptide carrying glutamyl residues that have been post-translationally carboxylated to γ-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues.

The amino acid sequence of the peptide is: Asn-Gla-Ser-Gla-Cys-Pro-d-Trp-His-Pro-Trp-Cys. As with most other contryphans, glacontryphan-M is amidated at the C terminus and maintains the five-residue intercysteine loop. The occurrence of a d-tryptophan residue was confirmed by chemical synthesis and HPLC elution profiles. Using fluorescence spectroscopy we demonstrated that the Gla-containing peptide binds calcium with a KD of 0.63 mm. Cloning of the full-length cDNA encoding glacontryphan-M revealed that the primary translation product carries an N-terminal signal/propeptide sequence that is homologous to earlier reported contryphan signal/propeptide sequences up to 10 amino acids preceding the toxin region. Electrophysiological experiments, carried out on mouse pancreatic B-cells, showed that glacontryphan-M blocks L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channel activity in a calcium-dependent manner.

Cloning of the full-length cDNA encoding glacontryphan-M revealed that the primary translation product carries an N-terminal signal/propeptide sequence that is homologous to earlier reported contryphan signal/propeptide sequences up to 10 amino acids preceding the toxin region. Electrophysiological experiments, carried out on mouse pancreatic B-cells, showed that glacontryphan-M blocks L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channel activity in a calcium-dependent manner. Glacontryphan-M is the first contryphan reported to modulate the activity of L-type calcium ion channels. The vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase catalyzes the post-translational conversion of glutamyl residues to γ-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NanoESI-MS, nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NanoESI-MS, nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. residues in precursor proteins that contain the appropriate γ-carboxylation recognition site within the propeptide of the precursor (1Stenflo J.

Among the classes of proteins that contain Gla, the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins have been most thoroughly studied. Upon addition of calcium they undergo a conformational transition that is a prerequisite for their interaction with biological membranes, and hence crucially important for their biological activity. Subsequent to its initial discovery, Gla was shown in 1984 to be present in venom peptides of highly specialized invertebrate systems, marine snails of the genus Conus (5McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Google Scholar, 6Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Ramilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 20: 257-263Google Scholar). It was found that a neuroactive Conus peptide, conantokin-G (17 amino acid residues) contained five residues of Gla. These discoveries indicated that the role of this post-translational modification in blood coagulation represents only a subset of Gla function in animal phyla. The cone snail venoms contain a diverse array of paralyzing peptides (conotoxins) that are injected into prey after a cone snail harpoons its victim. The peptides specifically bind to a variety of receptors and ion channels in the neuromuscular system and interfere with their function. The Gla content varies from species to species but is especially high in the venoms of Conus textile and Conus marmoreus (7Hauschka P.V. Mullen E.A. Hintsch G. Jazwinski S. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research. Elsevier, New York1988: 237-243Google Scholar). Cloning and expression of the Conus (8Begley G.S. Furie B.C. Czerwiec E. Taylor K.L. Furie G.L. Bronstein L.

Like its mammalian counterpart the Conus carboxylase requires a recognition site that resides on the propeptide of the precursor form of the toxin (14Bandyopadhyay P.K. Colledge C.J. Walker C.S.

Although the γ-glutamyl carboxylases are highly conserved, the Conus and mammalian carboxylase binding sites do not bear any obvious sequence resemblance.

These include bromination of tryptophan, proline hydroxylation, C-terminal amidation, and leucine and tryptophan L to D isomerization. Contryphans cause the so-called “stiff-tail syndrome” when injected intracranially in mice (35Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Cruz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28002-28005Google Scholar) and body tremor and secretion of mucous substances when injected into fish (36Jacobsen R. Jimenez E.C. De la Cruz R.G.C. Gray W.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 93-99Google Scholar). Recently, the first functional target for a contryphan was reported (37Massilia G.R. Eliseo T. Grolleau F. Lapied B. Barbier J. Bournaud R. Molgó J. Cicero D.O. Paci M. Schininá M.E. Ascenzi P. Poltizelli F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 238-246Google Scholar) as Contryphan-Vn from the wormhunting C. ventricosus was demonstrated to affect both voltage-gated and calcium-dependent K+ channels. Here we describe the identification, purification, and characterization of a novel contryphan peptide, glacontryphan-M, extracted from the venom of the molluscivorous C. marmoreus. Glacontryphan-M is the first example of a contryphan peptide containing Gla residues endowing it with calcium binding properties. Cloning of the cDNA of glacontryphan-M showed a high density of arginyl and lysyl residues in the propetide region compared with the propeptide regions of the earlier described contryphans. This might indicate that these basic residues are part of the γ-carboxylation recognition site. Patch-clamp recordings carried out on insulin-secreting B-cells from the islets of Langerhans demonstrate that glacontryphan-M, in a calcium-dependent manner, specifically antagonizes L-type Ca2+ channel activity. Like in other neuro- and endocrine cells (38Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 305-316Google Scholar) exocytosis from pancreatic B-cells is determined by calcium influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (39Barg S. Ma X. Eliasson L. Galvanovskis J. Göpel S.O. Obermuller S. Platzer J. Renström E. Trus M. Atlas D. Striessnig J. Rorsman P. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3308-3323Google Scholar). This is the first Gla-containing conopeptide reported to modulate the activity of this type of calcium ion channels. Conotoxin Purification—Frozen cone snails (C. marmoreus) were obtained from Vietnam. Lyophilized venom extract (1000 mg, from five cone snails) was dissolved in 0.2 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5) (17Fainzilber M. Gordon D. Hasson A. Spira M.E. Zlotkin E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 589-595Google Scholar, 20Rigby A.C. Lucas-Meunier E. Kalume D.E. Czerwiec E. Hambe B. Dahlqvist I. Fossier P. Baux G. Roepstorff P. Baleja J.D. Furie B.C. Furie B. Stenflo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5758-5763Google Scholar) and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 superfine column (2.5 × 92 cm) equilibrated with 0.2 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5) and eluted with a flow rate of 10.3 ml/h (Fig. 1A). The material in the major Gla-containing peak was separated on a reversed-phase HPLC column (HyChrom C18, 5 μm; 10 × 250 mm) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 2 ml/min (Fig. 1B). A total of 30 nmol of Glacontryphan-M was obtained from a second reversed-phase HPLC purification step (Vydac C18 column, 5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using a linear acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (Fig. 1C). Amino Acid Analysis and Sequencing—The amino acid composition of glacontryphan-M was determined after acid hydrolysis, except for Gla, which was measured after alkaline hydrolysis (40Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Google Scholar, 41Fernlund P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6125-6133Google Scholar). For peptide sequencing a PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Foster City, CA) ABI Procise 494 sequencer was used according to the protocol from the manufacturer. To identify the Gla residues in the sequence, the sample was methyl-esterfied with methanolic HCl prior to sequencing (42Cairns J.R. Williamson M.K. Price P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 93-97Google Scholar). Reduction and Alkylation of Disulfide Bonds—For reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues with iodoacetic acid (BDH Chemicals Ltd, Poole, England), the peptides were dissolved in 250 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 1 m Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.6). Dithiothreitol (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) was added to 20 mm followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, after which iodoacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, β-mercaptoethanol (BDH Chemicals Ltd) was added to a final concentration of 1% to quench the reaction. The sample was then dialyzed against 3.5 m acetic acid, and the peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides covering the mature toxin region of glacontryphan-M were synthesized either with a dor l-tryptophan at position 7. The peptides were synthesized with DPfd l- and d-Fmoc amino acids (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) on a Milligen 9050 Plus peptide synthesizer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with 95% anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid containing relevant scavengers. Each peptide was then applied to a C8 preparative reversed-phase HPLC column and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. For each of the synthesized peptides the major peak corresponding to the peptide fraction was added dropwise to an equal volume of 1 mm iodine in 20% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. After 15 min the reactions were quenched with a few drops of 0.1 m ascorbic acid. Each of the oxidized peptides was applied to a reversed-phase C8 preparative column and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Major peaks were analyzed with nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (NanoESI-MS). The synthesized d-tryptophan-containing peptide was further purified on a reversed-phase C18 column using an acetonitrile gradient supplied with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the synthesis was confirmed by NanoESI-MS analysis and amino acid sequencing. For the synthesized l-tryptophan-containing peptide, NanoESI-MS analysis revealed that only dimers had formed during the folding step. A peptide, glucontryphan-M, covering the mature toxin region of glacontryphan-M but having the Gla residues at positions 2 and 4 replaced with glutamic acid residues was synthesized, folded, and purified according to the above procedure. The synthesis was confirmed by NanoESI-MS analysis and amino acid sequencing. Mass Spectrometry—NanoESI mass spectra were acquired on an API QSTAR Pulsar-i quadrapole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a NanoSpray ion source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). The samples were sprayed from a silver-coated glass EconoTip nanospray capillary supplied by New Objective (Woburn, MA). Spectra were obtained in either positive or negative ion mode. A potential of 800–1100 V was applied to the nanoflow tip in the ion source using a curtain gas (N2) flow rate of 1.3 liter/min. The acquisition and the deconvolution of data were performed on an AnalystQS Windows PC data system. Bioanalyst version 1.0 software (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) was used to analyze the mass spectra. Samples were dried and dissolved (∼1–5 pmol/μl) in 50% (v/v) methanol supplied with 1% (v/v) formic acid for NanoESI-MS and MS/MS analysis in positive ion mode and in 50% acetonitrile for NanoESI-MS analysis in negative ion mode. Parent ions (identified in a time-of-flight MS survey scan) for MS/MS analysis were selected in Q1, and product ions were generated in Q2 using N2 as the collision gas and collision energies of 14–35 eV. Identification and Sequencing of a cDNA Clone Encoding Glacontryphan-M—On the basis of the amino acid sequence of the isolated contryphan peptide from C. marmoreus and the well conserved signal peptide of the previously identified contryphans, oligonucleotide primers were designed for PCR (amplification of the corresponding cDNA from a Lambda ZAP II Custom cDNA library (Stratagene). Two oligonucleotide primers with degenerate nucleotide sequences were synthesized. p95–1, 5′-ATG GGN AAR YTN ACN ATH YTN G-3′; p95–2, 5′-CCR CAC CAN GGR TGC CAN GGR CAY TC-3′(where n = A, T, C or G, Y = T or C, H = A, C or T, r = A or G) represent sequences complementary to the sequences at the N terminus signal peptide and the C terminus toxin region of the peptide, respectively. The amplification parameters for the PCR reactions were 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 46 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min; and a 10-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR product was TA-cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and the resulting plasmid DNA sequenced using M13 forward, 5′-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG AC-3′ and reversed 5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3′, primers. Gene-specific oligonucleotide primers, p95–3, 5′-TCT CGC TCT ACC TGG GTT ATC GTC-3′and p95–4, 5′-AGC GAG AAG AAA GCG CAT GAA AG-3′ (Fig. 6) were used in combination with the vector-specific M13 forward and reverse primers for PCR amplification of the 5′- and the 3′-ends of the cDNA encoding glacontryphan-M, respectively. The PCR products were cloned in vector pGEM-T and sequenced using M13 reverse and forward primers. The entire cDNA sequence of glacontryphan-M was assembled from the overlapping sequences and is predicted to contain the amino acid sequence of the mature contryphan toxin. The obtained cDNA sequence was confirmed by cloning (in pGEM-T) and sequencing (using M13 reverse and forward primers) of the PCR products obtained with oligonucleotide primer p95–6, 5′-AAC CTT TAT CAT GG-3′, in combination with primer p95–7, 5′-CAA TCG TGG ATT CCG ATC-3′, or primer p95–8, 5′-GGA CAT TCA GAC TCA TTT AG-3′ (Fig. 6). Calcium Binding Measurements—Tryptophan fluorescence was measured at 20 °C in a Spex Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex, Instruments s.a., Inc.) equipped with a 150 watt Xenon lamp. The peptide concentrations were 2 μm, and the solvent was metal-free 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.1 m NaCl. The samples were subjected to exciting light for a minimum of time to avoid photodecomposition. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 295 and 425 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and excitation and emission bandwidths of 2 and 8 nm, respectively. The Ca2+ dependence of the intrinsic fluorescence was measured by addition of 0.3–1 μl portions of 0.11 or 0.77 mm stock solutions of CaCl2 to 1 ml of sample and by averaging 30 signals readings of 0.25 s each. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm and the emission wavelength 355.5 nm (corresponding to the maximum fluorescence emission intensity of the peptides). The excitation and emission bandwidths were 2 and 8 nm, respectively. The data were expressed as 1 – F/F0 where F and F0 are the fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of Ca2+ ions, respectively. The dissociation constant was determined by non-linear regression to fit the data to the equilibrium binding equation (43Nordenman B. Danielsson A. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 1-6Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Isolated pancreatic islets from NMRI mice were dispersed into single cells using a Ca2+-free solution as described elsewhere (44Eliasson L. Ma X. Renström E. Barg S. Berggren P.O. Galvanovskis J. Gromada J. Jing X. Lundquist I. Salehi A. Sewing S. Rorsman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 181-197Google Scholar). The insulin-secreting B-cells were identified by their absence of Na+ current at physiological membrane-potentials (45Barg S. Galvanovskis J. Göpel S.O. Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1500-1510Google Scholar). Patchclamp electrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries coated with sylgard and fire-polished. The pipette resistance ranged between 3 and 6 MΩ when filled with pipette solution as specified below. Whole cell currents were recorded using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and the software Pulse ver 8.31 (Heka Elektronik, Germany). All experiments were conducted using the perforated patch whole cell configuration in which the cytoplasm retains intact. The standard extracellular solution consisted of 118 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethyl-ammonium chloride (TEA-Cl; to block voltage-gated K+ currents), 5.6 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 using NaOH). In the Ca2+-free extracellular solution CaCl2 was substituted with 11.4 mm sucrose (to retain similar osmolarity) and 2 mm EGTA (to bind Ca2+). Glacontryphan-M, glucontryphan-M, and isradipine were added to the extracellular solution as indicated in the figures. The pipette solution contained 76 mm Cs2SO4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.35 using CsOH). Electrical contact was established by addition of the pore-forming compound amphotericin B to the pipette solution (final concentration 0.24 mg/ml; Ref. 46Rae J. Cooper K. Gates P. Watsky M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 15-26Google Scholar). Data are presented as mean values ± S.E., and statistical significance was evaluated using the Student′s t test. Purification and Characterization of Glacontryphan-M— Crude C. marmoreus venom was extracted and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 superfine column (Fig. 1A). Every third collected fraction was analyzed for Gla content after alkaline hydrolysis. From the major Gla-containing peak, glacontryphan-M was purified by a two-step reversed phase HPLC procedure (Fig. 1, B and C). The primary sequence for the native form of the peptide was determined by automated Edman degradation to be Asn-Xxx-Ser-Xxx-Xxx-Pro-Trp-His-Pro-Trp-Xxx. Sequencing demonstrated partial deamidation (8–11%) of the N-terminal Asn residue. The presence of cysteines at positions 5 and 11 was deduced by sequencing the carboxymethylated peptide. At positions 2 and 4, γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues were identified in a peptide that had been methyl-esterfied prior to sequencing. The amino acid composition of the peptide analyzed after acid or alkaline hydrolysis was consistent with the following sequence: Asn-Gla-Ser-Gla-CysPro-Trp-His-Pro-Trp-Cys. The sequence shows high similarity to the amino acid sequences earlier described for peptides of the contryphan family of conotoxins (Table I). To further investigate the primary sequence of glacontryphan-M the peptide was analyzed by NanoESI-MS.Table IComparison of mature contryphan sequencesPeptideSequenceaO, 4-trans-hydroxyproline; W, d-tryptophan; L, d-leucine; X, bromotryptophan; γ, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid.SpeciesRef.Des(Gly1)contryphan-RCOWEPWC-NH2C. radiatus35Jimenez E.C.

The mass spectrum acquired in negative ion mode is shown in Fig. 2A (m/z 1400–1480) and B (m/z 680–750). The signal observed at m/z 1470.47 Da (M-1H, Fig. 2A) corresponds to the molecular ion of the peptide and the major ion peak at m/z 734.74 Da (Fig. 2B), most likely contain the doubly (M-2H) charged ion of glacontryphan-M. The unusual isotope distribution with the second peak being more intense than the first (Fig. 2, A and B) is in all likelihood caused by the deamidation of the N-terminal Asn residue. The presence of two Gla residues in the sequence is notable in the mass spectrum via decarboxylation of the peptide resulting in a loss of 44 Da for each Gla residue (Fig. 2B). This loss of CO2 is observed at m/z 712.74 Da and 690.75 Da for the doubly charged ion. The monoisotopic molecular mass of native glacontryphan-M was determined from the negative ion mode NanoESI-MS experiments to be 1471.47 Da. These data fit well with the theoretically calculated monoisotopic molecular mass (1471.48 Da) of the peptide, assuming disulfide bonding of the cysteine residues and, like most conopeptides, amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl group (Fig. 2C). The observed molecular mass of native glacontryphan-M was further confirmed by NanoESI-MS experiments performed in the positive ion mode (not shown). Reduction and alkylation of cysteines in glacontryphan-M with iodoacetic acid resulted in a mass increase of 118.13 Da (theoretical 118.01 Da) as compared with the native compound, consistent with two cysteine residues in the sequence (the monoisotopic molecular mass was determined to be 1589.60 Da; Fig. 3A). The S-carboxymethylated peptide was analyzed by MS/MS spectrometry in the positive ion mode. The fragment ion spectrum obtained for the selected trapped ion at m/z 795.80 Da (Fig. 3B) revealed b and y ions in agreement with the proposed sequence. The mass of the y1 ion further confirms that glacontryphan-M contains an amidated C terminus. The isotope pattern of the b ions was consistent with partial deamidation of the N-terminal Asn residue (Fig. 3B). The y ions gave no indication of deamidation of the C-terminal amide. Glacontryphan-M Contains a d-Tryptophan—The sequence similarity of the C. marmoreus contryphan with the previously identified contryphans suggested the presence of a d-tryptophan residue at position 7 (Table I). Therefore, a synthetic peptide covering the sequence of glacontryphan-M with a d-tryptophan at position 7 and having the C-terminal carboxyl group amidated was prepared and folded. Analysis of the synthetic material by automated Edman degradation and NanoESI-MS confirmed the sequence of the pepti"
https://openalex.org/W1995676524,"The loss of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) response due to the dysregulation of TGF-β receptors type I (RI) and type II (RII) is well known for its contribution to oncogenesis. Estrogen receptor-expressing breast cancer cells are refractory to TGF-β-mediated growth control because of the reduced expression of TGF-β receptors. Although RII is required for the binding of TGF-β to RI, RI is responsible for directly transducing TGF-β signals through the Smad protein family. Treatment of estrogen receptor-expressing MCF-7L and ZR75 breast cancer cells with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) led to a dramatic induction of RI. Accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 was observed in the SAHA-treated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis followed by PCR with RI promoter-specific primers indicated an accumulation of acetylated histones in chromatin associated with the RI gene, suggesting that histone deacetylation was involved in the transcriptional inactivation of RI. SAHA treatment stimulated RI promoter activity through the inhibition of Sp1/Sp3-associated HDAC activity. Histone acetyltransferase p300 stimulated RI promoter activity, thus further confirming the involvement of HDAC activity in the transcriptional repression of RI.

Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Google Scholar). TGF-β functions through cell surface receptors referred to as type I (RI) and type II (RII). RI requires RII for the binding of TGF-β. However, RI is a direct player in the TGF-β signaling pathway as it conveys signals from TGF-β through the activation of Smad protein family members (2Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Google Scholar). The loss of TGF-β response is well known for its contribution to oncogenesis and tumor progression. Direct involvement of RI in TGF-β signal transduction would suggest that loss or reduced expression of RI could contribute to TGF-β resistance resulting in a growth advantage that contributes to tumor progression. TGF-β resistance due to methylation of the RI promoter or RI promoter repression by Sp1 deficiency was reported to be a cause of TGF-β resistance in gastric and colon carcinomas (3Pinto M. Oliveira C. Cirnes L. Carlos Machado J. Ramires M. Nogueira A. Carneiro F. Seruca R. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 32-38Google Scholar, 4Periyasamy S. Ammanamanchi S. Tillekeratne M.P.M. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Google Scholar). The RI gene is frequently mutated in ovarian carcinomas (5Chen T. Triplett J. Dehner B. Hurst B. Colligan B. Pemberton J. Graff J.R. Carter J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4679-4682Google Scholar). Decreased expression of RI is associated with poor prognosis in bladder transitional cell carcinomas (6Tokunga H. Lee D.H. Kim I.Y. Wheeler T.M. Lerner S.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2520-2525Google Scholar). Reduced RI expression is also associated with unfavorable prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (7Fukai Y. Fukuchi M. Masuda N. Osawa H. Kato H. Nakajima T. Kuwano H. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 161-166Google Scholar). RI*6A, a polymorphic allele of RI, is emerging as a high frequency, low penetrance tumor susceptibility allele that predisposes to the development of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer, as well as hematologic malignancies (8Kaklamani V.G. Hou N. Bian Y. Reich J. Offit K. Michel L.S. Rubinstein W.S. Rademaker A. Pasche B. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 3236-3243Google Scholar). Polymorphisms in the microsatellite region of the RI gene were reported in head and neck cancers as well as non-small cell lung cancer (9Knobloch T.J. Lynch M.A. Song H. DeGroff V.L. Casto B.C.

Lung Cancer. 2003; 40: 281-287Google Scholar). Mutations in the kinase domain of the RI gene were associated with metastatic breast cancer (11Chen T. Carter D. Garrigue-Antar L. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4805-4810Google Scholar). Consequently, loss of RI expression appears to play a significant role in determining the malignant phenotype of a broad variety of cancer cells. RI replacement restored TGF-β response in colon and pancreatic cancer cells (12Wang J. Han W. Zborowska E. Liang J. Wang X.F. Willson J.K.V. Sun L.Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17366-17371Google Scholar, 13Wagner M. Kleef J. Lopez M.E. Bockman I. Massague J. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 255-260Google Scholar). The promoter for the RI gene has been partially characterized (14Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.P. Fine Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Google Scholar). The RI promoter lacks a distinct TATA box, is GC-rich, and depends on the Sp1 transcription factor for the initiation of transcription. The RI promoter contains four consensus and several putative Sp1 sites. It also contains an inverted CCAAT box, a putative NF-Y binding site, and an AP-2 element. Although members of the Sp gene family of transcription factors, Sp1, Sp2, and Sp4, are known to be activators of gene transcription, Sp3 can either be an activator or a repressor (15Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Google Scholar). Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors recognize the same DNA sequence and have similar DNA-binding affinities. We have reported previously that Sp1/Sp3 proteins control RI promoter activities (16Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that changes in chromatin structure by histone modification appear to play an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. Acetylation of core nucleosomal histones is regulated by the opposing activities of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as CBP/p300 and PCAF (17Marks P. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Google Scholar). Both HDACs and HATs are recruited to the target genes in complexes with sequence-specific factors and cofactors to regulate gene expression (18Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2002; 5: 29-41Google Scholar). A broad variety of human cancer cell lines, including estrogen receptor-expressing (ER+) breast cancer cell lines exhibit TGF-β resistance without detectable changes in the RI and RII genes (19Kim S.J. Im Y.H. Markowitz S.D. Bang Y.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 159-168Google Scholar, 20Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32854-32859Google Scholar). These cells express low or reduced levels of RI and RII, suggesting that abnormalities in transcriptional regulation, alterations in mRNA processing, or mRNA instability might be contributing to reduced receptor expression and hence TGF-β resistance in these cells. In this report, we present data indicating treatment of ER+ MCF-7L and ZR75 breast cancer cells with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) results in the accumulation of acetylated histones in the chromatin of the RI gene, and this increase is associated with an increased RI expression in the breast cancer cells. RI promoter activity is regulated by Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors (16Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Google Scholar). SAHA treatment inhibited Sp1/Sp3-associated HDAC activity leading to enhanced RI promoter activity and the concomitant RI expression. The wild type p300 (but not the histone acetyltransferase activity mutant p300) stimulated RI promoter activity. These results demonstrate that histone acetylation/deacetylation plays a central role in the transcriptional regulation of the RI gene, and Sp1/Sp3-associated histone deacetylases contribute to the transcriptional repression of RI in breast cancer cells. Our data further suggest that TGF-β signaling could be rescued through HDAC inhibitor SAHA-mediated RI induction. Cell Culture—MCF-7L and ZR75 breast cancer cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), amino acids, antibiotics, pyruvate, and vitamins (Invitrogen). The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Wherever indicated, MCF-7L and ZR75 cells were treated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml SAHA. Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts from control and SAHA-treated MCF-7L cells were prepared using the following procedure. The cells were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 2 packed cell volumes of buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of leupeptin and aprotinin/ml, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4 °C. The crude nuclei released by lysis were collected by microcentrifugation and resuspended in two-thirds of a packed cell volume of buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 μg of leupeptin and aprotinin/ml). The nulcei were incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were diluted 1:1 with buffer 3 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of leupeptin and aprotinin/ml). Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts were obtained from control and SAHA-treated MCF-7L and ZR75 breast cancer cells. Equal amounts of nuclear extracts were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then blotted with rabbit anti-human acetyl histone H3, histone H4, and HDAC1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA from control and SAHA-treated MCF-7L and ZR75 cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA. PCR analysis was then performed to determine the RI expression levels in control and SAHA-treated MCF-7L and ZR75 cells using the respective cDNAs as templates. Primers for actin were used for a control to determine the RI expression levels. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis allows a rough estimate of the changes in RNA levels to be obtained following SAHA treatment. A total of 30 cycles of amplification were performed. Primers for RI generate a 865-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, 5′-TTG TGG CAC GGT GAG AGT GT-3′; antisense primers, 5′-TGC TCC TGG GCT ATT GAA TCA-3′. Primers for actin generate a 621-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, 5′-ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ACG AGG-3′; antisense primers, 5′-AGG GGC CGG ACT CGT CAT ACT-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—MCF-7L cells were plated at a density of 4 × 106 cells/15-cm dish and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The next day, the cells were cultured with 0 or 100 ng/ml SAHA for 24 h. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (21Ammanamanchi S. Freeman J.W. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35775-35780Google Scholar). RI and actin primers were used to carry out PCR from DNA isolated from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. The optimal reaction conditions for PCR were determined for each primer pair. Parameters included denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min and annealing at 58 °C for 1 min followed by elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed by 2.5% agarose/ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. The following primers were used for PCR: RI promoter, sense: 5′-GTG GGG CGT GGC CAG AAA C-3′; antisense: 5′-GCC CTT TGT AAC TGC TCG GAG GAC-3′; β-actin, sense: 5′-CCA ACG CCA AAA CTC CC-3′; antisense: 5′-AGC CAT AAA AGG CAA CTT TCG-3′. Transfections and Luciferase Assay—The RI (-618 bpRI-Luc) promoter-luciferase reporter construct was used to determine RI promoter activity (14Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.P. Fine Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Google Scholar). The RI-Luc construct and control null vector without the RI promoter insert (pGL3) were transiently transfected into MCF-7L breast cancer cells using the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Applied Science) with a β-galactosidase plasmid for normalization (16Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 100 ng/ml SAHA 4 h following transfection. The cells were harvested 24 h following SAHA treatment, and promoter activities were determined using a commercial luciferase assay (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). To determine the effects of histone acetyltransferase p300 on RI promoter activity, wild type p300 (CMV-p300) or HAT domain-deleted mutant p300 (CMV-p300ΔHAT) along with RI-Luc plasmid were transfected into MCF-7L cells. The cells were harvested 48 h following transfection, and luciferase activity was determined following normalization to β-galactosidase. To determine that p300-dependent RI promoter activity is also Sp1-dependent, wild type Sp1 (CMV-Sp1) or mutant Sp1 (CMV-Sp1 DBD) along with p300 (CMV-p300) and RI-Luc plasmid were transfected into MCF-7L cells. The cells were harvested 48 h following transfection, and luciferase activity was measured. The TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter-luciferase reporter construct (p3TP-Lux) was used to determine TGF-β sensitivity as described previously (22Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.J. Sun L.Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Google Scholar). The TGF-β-responsive p3TP-Lux vector or pGL2-Lux null vector without the TGF-β response element was transiently transfected into MCF-7L cells. The cells were treated with 100 ng/ml SAHA 4 h following transfection. 24 h following SAHA treatment, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for an additional 24 h, and the cells were lysed and luciferase activity determined following normalization to β-galactosidase. Histone Deacetylase Assay—We immunoprecipitated endogenous Sp1/Sp3 from 500 μg of MCF-7L nuclear extracts using agarose-conjugated anti-rabbit Sp1/Sp3 polyclonal or control IgG antibodies. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for deacetylase activity using the HDAC fluorescent activity assay/drug discovery kit (AK-500; BIOMOL Research Laboratories). Briefly, the beads were incubated with 100 μm acetylated substrate in 100 μl of assay buffer containing or lacking 1 μm SAHA. Incubation of the reaction at 37 °C for 30 min allowed deacetylation of the substrate, which sensitized it to treatment with the developer and produced a fluorophore detectable on a fluorometric reader (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm). Inhibition of Histone Deacetylation Activates RI Expression—Besides DNA methylation, another epigenetic mechanism by which gene expression can be repressed involves deacetylation of chromosomal histones. Hypoacetylated chromatin is transcriptionally silent (17Marks P. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Google Scholar). Inhibition of histone deacetylation can be accomplished by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin A and SAHA (23Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 759-760Google Scholar). To determine whether SAHA induces acetylation of histones and the concomitant induction of RI expression, we have treated the ER+ MCF-7L and ZR75 breast cancer cells with 100 ng/ml SAHA for 24 h and performed immunoblot analysis on the nuclear extracts using antibodies to acetylated histones H3 and H4. Accumulation of acetylated histones was observed in SAHA-treated MCF-7L and ZR75 cells (Fig. 1a). HDAC1 expression levels were used to normalize protein. If histone deacetylation is associated with transcriptional repression, then histone acetylation following SAHA treatment should lead to RI expression. We isolated the total RNA from the control and the SAHA-treated MCF-7L and ZR75 cells and reverse transcribed the RNA into cDNA. PCR analysis using RI and actin primers was then performed. The RI message was induced in SAHA-treated MCF-7L and ZR75 cells (Fig. 1b). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis is a rough estimate of the changes in RNA levels following SAHA treatment. We have used MCF-7L cells in subsequent experiments to characterize the mechanism of RI repression in the breast cancer cells. SAHA Induces Accumulation of Acetylated Histones in Chromatin Associated with the RI Gene—Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to examine the effect of HDAC inhibition on the acetylation of histones H3 or H4 associated with the RI gene promoter. Chromatin fragments from MCF-7L cells cultured with or without SAHA for 24 h were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to acetylated histones H3 or H4. DNA from the immunoprecipitates was isolated, and PCR was performed using RI promoter primers (Fig. 2). Accumulation of RI with highly acetylated histones H3 and H4 was observed in SAHA-treated MCF-7L cells in comparison with untreated control cells. The accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 confirmed that histone deacetylation was involved in the transcriptional repression of RI. The SAHA effect on RI is selective because the β-actin gene was not affected. SAHA Treatment Affects RI Promoter Activity—SAHA-treated MCF-7L as well as ZR75 cells showed enhanced RI expression (Fig. 1b). To determine whether the enhanced RI expression levels following SAHA treatment were due to increased RI transcription, we analyzed RI promoter activities using an RI promoter-luciferase reporter construct in control and SAHA-treated MCF-7L cells. The RI promoter construct was described previously (14Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.P. Fine Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Google Scholar). The RI promoter lacks a distinct TATA box and contains two Sp1 binding sites. We reported previously that Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors control the activity of this RI promoter construct (16Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Google Scholar). The RI promoter exhibited enhanced activity in the presence of SAHA (Fig. 3), suggesting that stimulation of the RI promoter activity was contributing to enhanced RI expression. Sp1/Sp3 Associates with Histone Deacetylase Activity—We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western analysis to determine whether Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors associate with HDAC1 in MCF-7L cells. Sp1 as well as Sp3 associated with HDAC1. However, this interaction was not disrupted in the presence of HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, thus ruling out alterations in the association of Sp1/Sp3 and HDAC1 as a cause for RI induction in MCF-7L cells (Fig. 4a). Consequently, we hypothesized that SAHA was acting by inhibiting HDAC enzymatic activity associated with Sp1 and Sp3. To determine whether SAHA stimulates RI promoter activity through the inhibition of Sp1/Sp3-associated histone deacetylase activity, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Sp1/Sp3 from MCF-7L nuclear extracts using anti-Sp1 and -Sp3 or control IgG antibodies. The precipitated complexes were tested for their ability to deacetylate an acetylated histone substrate (Fig. 4b). The results show that Sp1 as well as Sp3 associates with deacetylase activity, and this activity is abolished when the deacetylase inhibitor SAHA is included in the deacetylation reaction. These data suggest that the histone deacetylase activity associated with Sp1 and Sp3 is completely sensitive to SAHA. Acetyltransferase p300 Stimulates RI Promoter Activity—Histone acetyltransferase p300 has been shown to up-regulate Sp1-dependent promoter activities (24Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the acetyltransferase activity of p300 was able to stimulate Sp1-dependent RI promoter activity, we co-transfected wild type CMV-p300 or HAT domain-deleted mutant p300 vector (CMV-p300ΔHAT) along with the RI promoter-luciferase construct in MCF-7L cells and analyzed the RI promoter activities. Western analysis indicated ectopic wild type p300 as well as mutant p300 are expressed in MCF-7L cells (Fig. 5a). Actin was used as a loading control. The wild type p300 stimulated Sp1-mediated RI promoter activity but not the acetyltransferase activity-null p300 mutant (Fig. 5b). This result suggests that p300 acts as a co-activator of Sp1-mediated RI promoter activity. To further determine that p300-dependent RI promoter activity is Sp1-dependent, we have analyzed the RI promoter activity using either wild type Sp1 or mutant Sp1 (Sp1 DBD) in which the DNA-binding domain is deleted. The p300 protein was able to up-regulate wild type Sp1-mediated RI promoter activity but not the DNA-binding domain-deleted mutant Sp1 (Fig. 5c), thus confirming that Sp1 and p300 collaborate in the trans-activation of RI promoter activity. SAHA-mediated RI Induction Restores TGF-β Response—To evaluate whether SAHA-mediated RI expression in MCF-7L cells restored TGF-β sensitivity, TGF-β-dependent promoter activity was analyzed using the p3TP-Lux plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter TGF-β-responsive element in tandem with a luciferase reporter. The TGF-β-responsive vector or null vector without the TGF-β-responsive element was transiently transfected into MCF-7L cells. Following transfection (4 h), the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml SAHA. 24 h after SAHA treatment, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for an additional 24 h, at which time the cells were lysed and luciferase activity determined following normalization to β-galactosidase (Fig. 6). RI expression restored TGF-β sensitivity, as indicated by the enhanced activity of the TGF-β response element in the SAHA-treated MCF-7L cells. TGF-β plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular processes including the growth control of most normal epithelial cells and some cancer cells. TGF-β functions through the specific cell surface receptors RI and RII. RI plays a direct role in the TGF-β signaling pathway through recruitment and activation of Smad protein family members. Consequently, loss or reduced expression of RI could generate TGF-β resistance resulting in a growth advantage that contributes to tumor progression. Losses of RI expression due to methylation, mutations, and polymorphisms in the RI promoter regions have been reported in a variety of cancers of epithelial origin (3Pinto M. Oliveira C. Cirnes L.

However, there are many cancer cell lines including ER+ breast cancer cells that show TGF-β resistance without changes in the RI gene structure, suggesting that abnormalities in the transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation could be a contributing factor for reduced RI expression. Besides DNA methylation, another epigenetic mechanism that frequently controls the transcriptional regulation of genes is the acetylation/deacetylation of chromosomal histones associated with target genes (23Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 759-760Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that treatment of ER+ breast cancer cells with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA regenerates RI expression. The transcription of the RI gene may be repressed by a compact chromatin structure, which is maintained by increased HDAC activity in these cells. RII was induced to a lesser extent than RI. MS-275, another HDAC inhibitor, was shown to induce RII expression but not RI (25Lee B.I. Park S.H. Kim J.W. Sausville E.A. Kim H.T. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Kim S.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 931-934Google Scholar). This may be the result of the differential selectivity of the HDAC inhibitors used or the heterogeneity of the cells involved. Similar to many growth factors and their receptor gene promoters, the RI promoter also lacks a classical TATA box, is GC-rich, and depends on the Sp1 transcription factor for its activity. We reported previously that Sp1/Sp3 proteins control RI promoter activity in ER+ breast cancer cells (16Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitor SAHA stimulated RI promoter activity in breast cancer cells. Further, our data indicated inhibition of Sp1/Sp3-associated HDAC activity is the contributing factor for the up-regulation of RI promoter activity. SAHA treatment suppresses the Sp1/Sp3-associated HDAC activity leading to a local disruption of the nucleosome structure of the RI promoter by acetylation of histones H3 and H4. The finding that the p300 protein possesses intrinsic acetyltransferase activity and by chemically modifying histone tails affects the nucleosomal environment and transcription has greatly advanced our understanding of its function. Subsequent studies revealed that non-histone proteins are also acetylated by p300, e.g. p53, Sp1, and Sp3 proteins (18Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2002; 5: 29-41Google Scholar, 26Braun H. Koop R. Ertmer A. Nacht S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4994-5000Google Scholar). The present model of promoter recognition and nucleosomal remodeling involves the recruitment of acetyltransferases such as CBP/p300 and PCAF to the promoter by DNA-binding activators such as Sp1/Sp3, which results in a remodeling of the nucleosomal structure by acetylating histones, possibly in concert with non-histone proteins (e.g. DNA-binding activators Sp1/Sp3) to allow for the initiation of transcription. Our data indicated that wild type p300 stimulates Sp1-dependent RI promoter activity but not the acetyltransferase activity-defective mutant p300. The p300 and Sp1 association was also shown to contribute to Sp1-dependent p21 promoter activity (24Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Google Scholar). PCAF and NF-Y association was reported to activate RII promoter activity (27Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.B. Sausville E.A. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Lee B.I. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5168-5174Google Scholar). However, how the co-activator/acetyltransferase interacts with DNA-binding activators to modulate their actions in the context of promoter access is not completely understood. DNA-binding activators bind in a sequence-specific manner to their cognate binding sites in enhancers and core promoter regions. DNA-binding activators with common DNA-binding domains often bind similar DNA sequences. However, additional regulatory steps must be present, as the complexity of these factors in undertaking specific functions cannot be readily explained by sequence-specific DNA-binding properties alone. Regulation through differential protein-protein interactions and/or chemical modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, are likely to contribute to their different functions. Transcription factors Sp1/Sp3 have been reported to undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation (15Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Google Scholar). Although Sp1 is known to be an activator of gene transcription, Sp3 is bifunctional and can either activate or repress target gene expression (15Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Google Scholar). For example, we reported previously that although unmodified Sp3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β receptors, acetylated Sp3 acts as a transcriptional activator (16Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Google Scholar, 21Ammanamanchi S. Freeman J.W. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35775-35780Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitor (SAHA)-mediated RI expression resulted in the restoration of TGF-β response as evidenced by the enhanced activity of a TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter-luciferase reporter in the SAHA-treated cells. Consequently, this result suggests that TGF-β tumor-suppressive function can be regained following regeneration of RI expression in ER+ breast cancer cells. We thank Dr. Guntram Suske for providing the CMV-Sp1 and CMV-Sp1 DBD expression plasmids and Dr. Victoria Richon of Aton Pharma, Inc., and Dr. Paolo Mascagni of Italfarmaco SpA for providing the HDAC inhibitor SAHA used in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2069104798,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are major etiological agents of cervical cancer. Despite excellent epidemiological evidence for a direct role of HPV-16 in cervical carcinogenesis, molecular pathways underlying carcinogenesis in vivo remain obscure. The E7 gene is required for immortalization and maintenance of the transformed phenotype in vitro; however, little is known about its role for tumorigenesis in vivo. The E7 gene codes for an unstable protein the abundance of which in cervical biopsies is unknown. We show here that E7 protein levels strongly increase during cervical carcinogenesis, underlining its fundamental role in cervical cancer. The E7 protein was found predominantly in the nucleus and to a minor extent in the cytoplasm in the cervical cancer cell line Ca Ski in vitro and in invasive cervical carcinoma in situ, suggesting that nuclear resident E7 plays a major role in cervical carcinogenesis in humans. The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is a major E7-target in vitro. We show here that pRb expression is initially upregulated in LSIL and disappears in later stages concomitant with increased E7 levels, suggesting that E7-driven degradation of pRb is involved in cervical tumorigenesis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2110248324,"With the use of a novel method for detecting differential gene expression, alterations in functional gene clusters related to transport or oxidative stress response and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide metabolism were identified in a HEK293 cell line engineered to overexpress the human ATP binding cassette transporter ABCA2. These included fatty acid binding protein, phospholipid binding protein, phospholipid synthesis protein, transporter cofactors, seladin-1, Abeta precursor protein (APP), vimentin, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. ABCA2 was highly expressed in neuroblastoma cells and colocalized with Abeta and APP. Additionally, increased APP protein levels were detected within ABCA2/APP double-transfected cells, and increased Abeta was detected in the media of ABCA2-transfected cells relative to controls. The transporter was abundant in the temporal and frontal regions of both normal and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain but was detected at lower concentrations in the parietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions. The ABCA2 transfected cell line expressed resistance to a free radical initiator, confirming involvement in protection against reactive oxygen species and suggesting a further possible link to AD."
https://openalex.org/W2132463042,"In vivo, left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction involves hypertrophy generally attributed to increased cardiac workload. We hypothesized that hypoxia/reoxygenation directly induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and studied several participating kinases and transcription factors in isolated cardiomyocytes. Hypoxia for 6 h followed by 42 h reoxygenation induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy assessed by 3H leucine incorporation and immunohistochemistry. Inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS), serine/threonine kinase AKT, and ERK abolished reoxygenation-induced hypertrophy. In addition, a beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) antagonist, as well as Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin, blocked reoxygenation-induced hypertrophy. Hypoxia for 6 h increased transcription factors CREB, NF-kappaB, and GATA DNA binding activities. However, only CREB DNA-binding was sustained during reoxygenation. Inhibition of PI3-kinase, ERK, and PKA abrogated reoxygenation-induced CREB DNA-binding without affecting CREB serine-133 phosphorylation. These same pathways were found to regulate hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced GSK3beta kinase activity and CREB serine-129 de-phosphorylation. GSK3beta mutants resistant to phosphorylation blocked the stimulation of CRE-dependent transcription induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation. Transfection of cardiomyocytes with a dominant-negative mutant of CREB abrogated hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced hypertrophy. We suggest that hypoxia/reoxygenation induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through CREB activation. Inactivation of GSK3beta by hypoxia/reoxygenation, possibly integrating PI3-kinase and ERK pathways downstream of beta2-AR and ROS, is a prerequisite for CRE-dependent transcription. Transient hypoxia may contribute to cardiac hypertrophy in ischemic heart disease independent of cardiac workload."
https://openalex.org/W2021224773,"Ca2+-regulated photoproteins are members of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family. The addition of Ca2+ produces a blue bioluminescence by triggering a decarboxylation reaction of protein-bound hydroperoxycoelenterazine to form the product, coelenteramide, in an excited state. Based on the spatial structures of aequorin and several obelins, we have postulated mechanisms for the Ca2+ trigger and for generation of the different excited states that are the origin of the different colors of bioluminescence. Here we report the crystal structure of the Ca2+-discharged photoprotein obelin at 1.96-Å resolution. The results lend support to the proposed mechanisms and provide new structural insight into details of these processes. Global conformational changes caused by Ca2+ association are typical of the class of calcium signal modulators within the EF-hand protein superfamily. Accommodation of the Ca2+ ions into the loops of the EF-hands is seen to propagate into the active site of the protein now occupied by the coelenteramide where there is a significant repositioning and flipping of the His-175 imidazole ring as crucially required in the trigger hypothesis. Also the H-bonding between His-22 and the coelenterazine found in the active photoprotein is preserved at the equivalent position of coelenteramide, confirming the proposed rapid excited state proton transfer that would lead to the excited state of the phenolate ion pair, which is responsible for the blue emission of bioluminescence.

Calcium-binding proteins are probably one of the most extensively studied protein families. The main reason for such attention is because these proteins regulate numerous vital intracellular events in living cells and organisms. The members of this family are related not necessarily by any similarity in function but by the fact that most of them selectively bind calcium through a homologous structural unit known as the EF-hand (1Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of more than fifty EF-hand proteins have been determined and these fall into about twelve functional types (3Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) that can in part be combined into two functional classes, Ca2+ sensor proteins and Ca2+ signal modulators. Upon binding Ca2+, the Ca2+ sensor proteins undergo large conformational changes, which may be functionally related. The well known representatives of this group, calmodulin and troponin C, appear to function by exposing a large hydrophobic area upon binding Ca2+, which enables them to target certain receptor proteins. In contrast, the Ca2+ signal modulators show a much smaller conformational transition upon loading with Ca2+. A well known Ca2+ signal modulator is parvalbumin, the first structure determined for an EF-hand protein. It is not known how the configurations of the EF-hand structural motifs determine whether Ca2+ binding will induce a conformational transition or not, and for many of these proteins even the cellular function is debated. There is however, one subfamily of proteins in this broad Ca2+-binding protein family, the Ca2+-regulated photoprotein subfamily that has a well established function. It is to emit blue photons upon the appearance of Ca2+, a function evidently with some survival benefit for the host, although the real nature of the benefit is not known. Aequorin, named for the jellyfish Aequorea from which it was isolated, was the first Ca2+-regulated photoprotein to be discovered (4Shimomura O. Johnson F.H. Saiga Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1962; 59: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) and has been extensively investigated (5Ohmiya Y. Hirano T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Aequorin emits blue light upon the addition of Ca2+, but the bioluminescence from the jellyfish itself is green, corresponding to the fluorescence of the famous green fluorescent protein, which is excited to fluoresce secondarily by the energy generated from the biochemical reaction in the aequorin. Ca2+-regulated photoproteins have now been detected in a variety of bioluminescent marine organisms, mostly coelenterates (6Morin J.G. Muscatine L. Lenhoff H.M. Coelenterate Biology: Reviews and New Perspectives. Academic Press, New York1974: 397-438Crossref Google Scholar). The primary sequence of aequorin determined after almost 25 years revealed the canonical Ca2+-binding EF-hands (7Inouye S. Noguchi M. Sakaki Y. Takagi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3154-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 8Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A. McCann R.O. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Vanaman T.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6762-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and this is now known to be common in the sequences of photoproteins from other genera, such as obelin from Obelia (9Illarionov B.A. Bondar V.S. Illarionova V.A. Vysotski E.S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 273-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Blinks J.R. Burakova L.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2227-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and all show high homology to aequorin. The bioluminescence activity of these photoproteins arises from the chemical breakdown of coelenterazine, an imidazolopyrazine derivative substituted by a hydroperoxy at the C-2 position and tightly but noncovalently bound within the photoprotein (Scheme 1A, R1 = OH, R2 = benzyl, R3 = p-hydroxybenzyl). Early in the history of this subject McCapra and Chang (11McCapra F. Chang Y.C. Chem. Commun. 1967; 19: 1011-1012Google Scholar) investigated the chemiluminescence of a certain imidazolopyrazine derivative (Scheme 1A, R1 = H, R2 = R3 = methyl) and established the reaction mechanism in Scheme 1. In the photoprotein the otherwise highly labile hydroperoxycoelenterazine (Scheme 1B) is stabilized within an active site cavity. A photoprotein, in other words, can be regarded as an enzyme having a stabilized reaction intermediate. The binding of Ca2+ initiates the decarboxylation resulting in the excited state of the product, coelenteramide (Scheme 1C), which remains bound within the protein. Calcium is not essential for the bioluminescence of photoproteins because alone they give off a very low level of light emission known as calcium-independent luminescence (12Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1977; 195: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar); however, the light intensity is increased up to 1 million-fold or more upon the addition of calcium. The bioluminescence spectral distributions of photoproteins are broad with maxima in the range of 465 to 495 nm depending on the type. Photoproteins themselves are hardly fluorescent but the Ca2+-discharged photoproteins have strong fluorescence with type-dependent maxima in the range of 465 to 520 nm. Fluorescence studies of coelenteramide and its analogues have shown that the differences of the bioluminescence spectra among photoproteins are attributable to the activation of different ionic excited states of coelenteramide under the influence of the environment of the active site. These states include the neutral coelenteramide with a fluorescence spectral maximum around 400 nm, the amide monoanion with a fluorescence spectral maximum around 450 nm, a phenolate ion pair with a fluorescence spectral maximum in the range of 465 to 495 nm, and a pyrazine-N(4) anion with a fluorescence spectral maximum in the range of 530 to 565 nm (13Shimomura O. Teranishi K. Luminescence (Chichester). 2000; 15: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Imai Y. Shibata T. Maki S. Niwa H. Ohashi M. Hirano T. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 146: 95-107Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently the crystal structures of several photoproteins have been solved. These are aequorin (15Head J.F. Inouye S. Teranishi K. Shimomura O. Nature. 2000; 405: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), obelin from Obelia longissima (16Liu Z.-J. Vysotski E.S. Chen C.-J. Rose J.P. Lee J. Wang B.-C. Protein Sci. 2000; 11: 2085-2093Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Liu Z.-J. Vysotski E.S. Deng L. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and some other obelins (18Deng L. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Malikova N.P. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Blinks J.R. Deng L. Frank L.A. Herko M. Malikova N.P. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As expected from the homology of the primary sequences, all the photoproteins have the same compact globular structure. The tertiary structure contains two sets of four helices composed of helixturn-helix motifs I and II in the N-terminal end and III and IV in the C-terminal end. The hydroperoxycoelenterazine binding cavity is highly hydrophobic and is formed by residues originating from each of the helices. In addition, several hydrophilic side chains are also directed internally. These are His-22, Tyr-138, and His-175 from helix-turn-helix motifs I and IV, respectively, and Tyr-190, which is near the C terminus of the protein (the residues are numbered according to the obelin sequence). The side chains of these hydrophilic residues form a network of hydrogen bonds that apparently stabilizes the highly labile hydroperoxycoelenterazine. It has been generally considered that, as with other calcium-binding proteins, a structural change induced by Ca2+ is responsible for initiating the full bioluminescence activity. Indeed, heteronuclear single quantum coherence-NMR experiments indicate five distinct conformation states controlled by the binding of the various ligands, Ca2+, coelenterazine, and coelenteramide (Fig. 1) (20Lee J. Glushka J.N. Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Case J.F. Herring P.J. Robison B.H. Haddock S.H.D. Kricka L.J. Stanley P.E. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence 2000. World Scientific Publishing Company, Singapore2001: 99-102Google Scholar). The structure of conformation state II has been determined for aequorin and obelin. Based on these spatial structures and the detection of the hydrogen-bond network in the binding cavity we have proposed mechanisms for how the binding of Ca2+ might trigger the bioluminescence reaction and for how different excited states could result. Clearly however, for testing these hypotheses and for revealing intimate details of the processes, the structures of several of these conformation states would be highly desirable to have in hand. In this paper we report the crystal structure of a Ca2+-discharged photoprotein bound with the product of the bioluminescent reaction, coelenteramide (conformation state IV in Fig. 1) solved at 1.96-Å resolution. The results lend support to the proposed mechanisms for the Ca2+ trigger and for the formation of the different excited states of photoprotein bioluminescence, providing new structural insight into the details of these processes. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—High purity recombinant W92F obelin 1The abbreviations used are: W92F obelin, Obelia longissima obelin mutant with substitution of Trp to Phe; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. was prepared as described elsewhere (19Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Blinks J.R. Deng L. Frank L.A. Herko M. Malikova N.P. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Apo-W92F obelin was converted to a photoprotein with synthetic coelenterazine (Prolume Ltd., Pittsburgh, PA). The procedure for discharging W92F obelin was to slowly add CaCl2 to a 1 mg/ml solution of the protein in 10 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0, until bioluminescence emission ceased and the solution was colorless. This procedure and the crystallization of the Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin are described in detail elsewhere (21Deng L. Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The crystallization condition is 1.5 m tri-sodium citrate in 0.1 m Na-Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. Crystals took 1 month to grow to a size suitable for diffraction with dimensions of 0.15 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm. The crystal fluorescence of the Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin was examined. A single crystal was transferred to a droplet containing only the crystallization mother liquor. The green fluorescence from the crystal that was observed under a stereomicroscope with excitation at 350 nm (Fig. 5) clearly indicated that coelenteramide is bound within the protein. Data Collection and Data Processing—A crystal was directly mounted to a fiber loop and flash-frozen into liquid nitrogen before the data collection process. A 360° data set of Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin was collected at the in-house copper x-ray source with a Bruker Smart 6000 charge-coupled device detector. An 8° of 2θ was used for the purpose of extending the data resolution to 1.9 Å. The data were processed and scaled by the Bruker program Proteum. The crystal of Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin belongs to a P41212 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 53.4 Å, and c = 144.0 Å. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit.

Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13850) Google Scholar), resulting in an R factor of 30.3% and an R-free factor of 30.7%. Further refinement of Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin was extended to 1.96 Å using RefMac 5.0 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Each cycle of refinement was followed by manual model adjustment using XTALVIEW (23McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The final stereochemical parameters of the structure were evaluated with the programs PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S.

Overall Structure of Ca2+-discharged W92F Obelin—Although study of several types of Ca2+-discharged photoproteins was attempted, only the Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin produced crystals of sufficient quality to enable a structure solution at 1.96-Å resolution (Table I) (21Deng L. Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This W92F mutant of obelin emits two bands of bioluminescence, one blue and the other in the violet range, but the fluorescence of the Ca2+-discharged protein is green like the wild type obelin, and other biochemical properties are also the same. The three-dimensional structures of W92F and the wild type are also practically identical (18Deng L. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Malikova N.P. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Blinks J.R. Deng L. Frank L.A. Herko M. Malikova N.P. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J.

Fig. 2 shows that the crystal structure of the Ca2+-discharged protein retains the same overall scaffold as the undischarged photoprotein (18Deng L. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Malikova N.P.

The r.m.s.d. from the 185 C-α atomic positions of Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin versus W92F obelin is only 0.306 Å. Fig. 2b shows the well conserved structural features between these two protein states, the one primed with the hydroperoxycoelenterazine and the other with the bioluminescence reaction product, coelenteramide. This observation suggests that Ca2+-regulated photoproteins belong to the category of Ca2+ signal modulators rather than to the category of Ca2+ sensors in the EF-hand protein family (3Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The first six residues at the N terminus and the four residues at the loop region of the third helix-turn-helix motif were not observed in the electron density maps and were assumed to be disordered. Structure of the Active Site Cavity—The coelenteramide fits precisely into the electron density (Fig. 3a), and it is buried in a highly hydrophobic cavity situated at the center of the protein structure (Fig. 2a) in the same place as the precursor hydroperoxycoelenterazine (18Deng L. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Malikova N.P. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), surrounded by residues from each of the eight helices of the protein. This solvent-inaccessible cavity apparently provides the necessary environment for efficient excited state product generation and fluorescence. Going from the hydroperoxycoelenterazine to coelenteramide, the biggest structural change of the molecule (Fig. 3b) is in the reaction center around the C-2 position (C-2, O-33, and C-10, Fig. 4), resulting in an obvious orientational deviation of the phenol group at the C-10 position. The other parts of the coelenterazine molecule also adjust positions a little but not dramatically.Fig. 4Two-dimensional drawing of the hydrogen-bond (dashed lines) network at the binding site of W92F obelin (a) and coelenteramide (b) in Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin. The relative positions of Phe-88 and Phe-92 are also shown in dot-dash lines. Sequence alignment indicates that the Phe-88 in obelin corresponds to the Tyr-82 in aequorin, which provides an extra H-bond. These sequence alignment differences may account for some of the spectral differences between these photoproteins. Distances are in Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The key residues facing into the binding cavity and interacting with the hydroperoxycoelenterazine do not shift positions after the reaction except for His-175 and Tyr-138 (Figs. 3b and 4). The Tyr-138 was in an H-bonding interaction with the N-1 of hydroperoxycoelenterazine but has now moved away with a slight rotation (Fig. 4, 4.33 Å, 13°). The His-175 has flipped the imidazole ring perpendicular (63°) to the original conformation toward the hydroxyl group of Tyr-190. A water molecule (blue ball) originally hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-138 is no longer there after reaction, and two new water molecules (brown balls) are introduced into the binding cavity. The published crystal structures of photoproteins all have typical EF-hand spatial structure characteristics, but the loop structures III and IV are not prepositioned for Ca2+ binding. Some movements of the ligating residues must have to occur upon Ca2+ binding to accommodate the coordinating atoms to the required 2.4-Å separation commonly observed in the Ca2+-loaded structures of other EF-hand proteins (26Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including the Ca2+ in loop I of obelin (17Liu Z.-J. Vysotski E.S. Deng L. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that we formulated (19Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Blinks J.R. Deng L. Frank L.A. Herko M. Malikova N.P. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for the way in which calcium binding triggers the photoprotein bioluminescence is that the loop residue displacement to accommodate the Ca2+ is transmitted to the helices of EF-hand IV where the critical His residue (His-175 in obelin) is located. The spatial displacement of His-175 is crucial for Ca2+ triggering according to the proposed mechanism because it disrupts the hydrogen-bond network by which the hydroperoxycoelenterazine had been stabilized. That this His-175 plays an essential role for bioluminescence activity is supported by observations of aequorin. Site-directed mutagenesis of the five histidine residues in aequorin has shown that substitution of His-169 (corresponding to His-175 for obelin) to Ala, Phe, or Trp leads to complete loss of activity, whereas modification of the remaining four histidine residues yields mutant aequorins with varying bioluminescence activities (27Ohmiya Y. Tsuji F.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In Scheme 2 we show how this Ca2+-triggered displacement of the imidazole ring of His-175 could lead to the intermediate steps resulting in generation of the product excited states. With the caution that a change of the His-175 to Tyr-190 with a hydrogen-bond distance of 2.64 to 2.54 Å is hardly significant at this resolution, reducing this separation would make the H-bond stronger (28Jeffrey G.A. An Introduction to Hydrogen Bonding, Oxford University Press, New York1997Google Scholar) by an increased electrostatic character equivalent to a partial positive charge on the His-175 and then leave Tyr-190 partially in the negatively charged phenolate form. We represent this in Scheme 2 (step 1) by a transient proton transfer from Tyr-190 to His-175. Because the Tyr-190 phenol and the hydroperoxy group have similar pK values, proton transfer from the hydroperoxy is feasible (step 2) leaving the peroxy anion to immediately undertake a nucleophilic attack on the C-3 position of the coelenterazine to form the dioxetanone intermediate (step 3). The uphill reaction sequence would be favored by the exergonicity from the irreversible formation of the dioxetanone. In the product structure (Fig. 4) it is also seen that a new water molecule has moved into position bridging Tyr-190 and the carbonyl oxygen through hydrogen bonds. The primary excited state in the reaction in Scheme 1 is the coelenteramide amide anion but within the protein cavity this would be rapidly protonated to the excited state of the neutral coelenteramide. In the photoprotein (18Deng L. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Malikova N.P. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) Tyr-138 makes an H-bond to the N-1 atom of hydroperoxycoelenterazine (2.68 Å) and is an obvious first choice as a proton donor. However, as Tyr-138 moves away to 4.33 Å after the reaction (Fig. 4), a more likely candidate proton would be for the one that protonated His-175 (Scheme 2) to return to Tyr-190 with the bridging water molecule now conveniently located to relay a proton to the carbonyl oxygen of the coelenteramide (step 6). Thus the proton relay cycle is completed, and the photoprotein is essentially turned over like an enzyme. Turnover has in fact been demonstrated in the case of aequorin (29Shimomura O. Musicki B. Kishi Y. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The present structure does not reveal the loop residue displacements required in the trigger mechanism because, although the crystal was grown from the protein solution in the presence of calcium, the precipitant used for successfully obtaining a good crystal was sodium citrate, which is a strong cation chelator (21Deng L. Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Consequently the crystal contains no bound Ca2+ and therefore corresponds to conformation state IV in Fig. 1. However the crystals do give a green fluorescence similar to that of a solution of Ca2+-discharged W92F obelin with or without the presence of calcium ions (Fig. 5) (19Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Blinks J.R. Deng L. Frank L.A. Herko M. Malikova N.P. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Calcium binding shifts the fluorescence maximum to a longer wavelength by only 10 nm, so it is reasonable to assume that the coelenteramide binding environment in the current crystal structure (the IV conformation state of Fig. 1) is practically the same as in the Ca2+-loaded state (conformation state III of Fig. 1). It is probable that the difference in the NMR spectra observed for these two conformation states arises from the displacement of residues involved in the Ca2+ binding. The suggested mechanism (Scheme 2) also provides a reasonable explanation for calcium-independent luminescence. It is conceivable that proton transfer from Tyr-190 to His-175 could also occur in the absence of Ca2+ through the spontaneous motion of these residues resulting in a decrease in H-bond distance. The extremely small probability of this occurrence would probably account for this phenomenon. Fluorescence and Bioluminescence Spectra—The bioluminescence emission from W92F obelin is bimodal with one band maximum at 405 nm and the other similar to the band maximum from wild type obelin at 485 nm (18Deng L. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Malikova N.P. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Other position 92 mutants also produce bimodal emission spectra with W92R obelin almost completely monomodal at the shorter wavelength (30Malikova N.P. Stepanyuk G.A. Frank L.A. Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 405-nm band originates from the excited state of the neutral coelenteramide bound to the protein. On the basis of the photoprotein structure and fluorescence model studies it has been suggested that the 485-nm band is from the excited state of the 5-phenolate ion of coelenteramide in an ion pair interaction with His-22 (19Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Blinks J.R. Deng L. Frank L.A. Herko M. Malikova N.P. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Malikova N.P. Stepanyuk G.A. Frank L.A. Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Scheme 2). In the first electronic excited state, the pK* of the 5-hydroxyphenyl group should be sufficiently near that of the His-22 to make rapid proton transfer feasible, particularly as the His-22 H-bond interaction in W92F obelin (2.84 Å) is practically unchanged (2.82 Å) in the Ca2+-discharged photoprotein (Fig. 4). The fluorescence spectra of wild type and W92F obelin have practically the same maximum values (18Deng L. Vysotski E.S. Liu Z.-J. Markova S.V. Malikova N.P. Lee J. Rose J. Wang B.-C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As the bioluminescence and fluorescence are believed to originate from the same excited state species, a 25-nm redshift of the fluorescence from the bioluminescence would result if the final structure of the binding cavity were more polar than that at the instant of bioluminescence emission. Model studies do show that the fluorescence spectra of coelenteramide anions shift to a longer wavelength in more polar solvents. It is noted that in comparison with hydroperoxycoelenterazine in the photoprotein cavity, two new water molecules are now in H-bonding interactions with the coelenteramide (Fig. 4). If the water molecule interacting with N-4 were to arrive there only in some relaxation period following the bioluminescence emission, then plausibly this would render the environment more polar for the fluorescence measurement than during the bioluminescence. Evidence from the structure of the active site cavity in the Ca2+-discharged photoprotein lends support to the ideas concerning the mechanism through which the Ca2+ triggers the reaction and the pathway leading to generation of the bioluminescent excited states. The His-22 that was proposed to have an excited state ion pair interaction to explain the population of alternative ionic excited states can clearly fulfill this role, as it is seen to remain unchanged in its H-bonding to the hydroxy oxygen of the 5-hydroxyphenyl substituent of coelenteramide. The binding site residue His-175, already implicated as having a key role in triggering the bioluminescence reaction, shifts position to provide a pathway for a proton relay process to destabilize the hydroperoxycoelenterazine. Additionally, two water molecules move into interaction with the reaction product coelenteramide, one of which would provide a means for the proton relay to cycle. To complete the photoprotein story with more direct support for the trigger mechanism, it will be necessary to solve the structure of the Ca2+-loaded conformation (III), which should reveal the effect of residue shifts in the Ca2+-binding loops propagating into the shift of the His-175 position. Perhaps this shift would then be more substantial. Other questions yet to be addressed include the origin of spectral differences between the types of photoprotein bioluminescence and the reason for the shift of fluorescence from the bioluminescence of discharged obelins, a phenomenon that has not been observed in the case of aequorin. Probably all of these spectral differences can be attributed to variations in effective dielectric constants in the different binding cavities, and it will be important to have the Ca2+-discharged aequorin structure to provide evidence in this regard. If very little structural change occurs in Ca2+-regulated photoproteins following interaction with Ca2+, then these proteins would appear to fall in the Ca2+ signal modulator class of EF-hand proteins and potentially implement similar functions in living cells peculiar to this class of EF-hand proteins, i.e. modulation of calcium influx. The photoproteins are located in special light-emitting cells (photocytes), and in the case of the hydroid Obelia for example (31Brehm P. Lechleiter J. Smith S. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1989; 3: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the bioluminescence response from these cells is subject to complex regulation. The influx of calcium into nonluminescent endodermal cells through conventional voltage-dependent calcium channels is required for the excitation-luminescence coupling. Then the subsequent diffusion of this calcium, via gap junctions, into the neighboring photocytes triggers a localized luminescence response. Following intense stimulation, the local rise in calcium elicits a secondary wave of luminescence that is supported by a voltage-independent calcium permeability mechanism in the photocyte plasma membrane. This suggests that photoproteins might also modulate calcium signals in this organism. Tantalizing questions for future illumination remain, however, including how a protein that modulates calcium signals has evolved to produce bioluminescence in coelenterates but not in related organisms and in which other organisms this same protein might be found."

IGFBP-5 was first identified and purified from human bone extracts and conditioned medium obtained from cultured human osteoblast-like cells (1Bautista C.M. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Biochem. Biophys.

Mature human IGFBP-5 consists of 252 amino acids that can be divided into a highly conserved cysteine-rich N-terminal domain, a conserved C-terminal domain, and a variable middle L domain (3Shimasaki S.

In adult rats, IGFBP-5 is expressed in many tissues, with high levels in the kidney, muscle, bone, lung, heart, brain, ovary, and testes (3Shimasaki S. Shimonaka M. Zhang H.P. Ling N. J. Biol.

Copeland N.G. Rotwein P. Genomics. 1994; 20: 412-418Google Scholar). The role of IGFBP-5 in bone cell growth and differentiation has been studied extensively (7Clemmons D.R. Endocr.

Although it is generally agreed that IGFBP-5 is important, there is a host of inconsistent, and even contradictory, findings in the literature regarding its precise role(s) in regulating bone cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, when added in combination with IGF-I to cultured human osteoblastic cells, IGFBP-5 was found to potentiate IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis and differentiation (1Bautista C.M. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 756-763Google Scholar, 2Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 213-218Google Scholar, 10Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. J.

Schlapfer I. Gosteli-Peter M.A. Froesch E.R. Zapf J. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 167-173Google Scholar). The potentiating effects of IGFBP-5 were attributed to its ability to bind to bone extracellular matrix because IGFBP-5 has a high affinity for hydroxyapatite (1Bautista C.M. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 756-763Google Scholar, 11Mohan S. Nakao Y. Honda Y. Landale E. Leser U. Dony C. Lang K. Baylink D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20424-20431Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, others have suggested an inhibitory role of IGFBP-5 in IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis in this cell type (13Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiarz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Google Scholar, 14Conover C.A. Kiefer M.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 1153-1159Google Scholar). Likewise, stable overexpression of IGFBP-5 was found to inhibit mouse osteosarcoma cell proliferation (15Schneider M.R. Zhou R. Hoeflich A. Krebs O. Schmidt J. Mohan S. Wolf E. Lahm H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 435-442Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that IGFBP-5 itself can act as a bone growth factor and exert cellular effects that are independent of IGFs (16Miyakoshi N. Richman C. Kasukawa Y. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 73-81Google Scholar). There are also inconsistent in vivo findings. Although systemic administration of IGFBP-5 to intact or ovariectomized mice has been shown to stimulate bone performance parameters, including alkaline phosphatase activity, and/or to increase the osteoblast cell number (17Richman C. Baylink D.J. Lang K. Dony C. Mohan S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4699-4705Google Scholar, 18Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E283-E288Google Scholar), transgenic mice overexpressing IGFBP-5 in bone tissues exhibited transient decreases in bone performance parameters (19Devlin R.D. Du Z. Buccilli V. Jorgetti V. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3955-3962Google Scholar). All the previous studies relied on gain-of-function approaches, either by adding large amounts of purified IGFBP-5 to or by overexpressing IGFBP-5 in cultured cells or tissues. Although these approaches are useful in demonstrating the biological capabilities of IGFBP-5, they do not necessarily provide insight into the physiological function(s) of the endogenous protein. Because IGFBP-5 is abundantly expressed in bone cells, interpretation of data from these studies using the addition/overexpression of IGFBP-5 approach is not always straightforward. Another complication is the presence of one or more IGFBP-5 protease(s) secreted by these cells and the fact that some IGFBP-5 fragments can exert IGF-independent actions in bone cells (18Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E283-E288Google Scholar, 20Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role(s) of endogenous IGFBP-5 in bone cells using a loss-of-function approach. Using short double-stranded RNA (siRNA) to trigger RNA interference, we knocked down the endogenously synthesized IGFBP-5 in U2 osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Our results indicate that endogenous IGFBP-5 is involved in regulating U2-OS cell survival and differentiation, but it plays limited role in cell proliferation. Materials—All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Fisher unless noted otherwise. Human IGF-I and IGFBP-5 were purchased from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). Fetal bovine serum, McCoy's 5α medium, OPTI-minimum essential medium, penicillin-streptomycin, and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmid Construction—Vector pSUPER, which generates biologically active siRNA from the polymerase III H1-RNA gene promoter (21Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Reuven Agami (Netherlands Cancer Institute). To generate the pSUPER-BP5 plasmid, a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GAAGCTGACCCAGTCCAAGttcaagaga-CTTGGACTGGGTCAGCTTC-3′) was introduced into pSUPER. This oligonucleotide contains sequences corresponding to a 19-nucleotide sequence from human IGFBP-5 (nucleotides 474-492, numbering with A of the ATG (start) codon as 1), a 9-nucleotide linker (lowercase letters), and the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. For the construction of various IGFBP expression plasmids, DNA fragments corresponding to the entire coding region and various domain(s) of human IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-4 were amplified by PCR as described previously (22Xu Q. Yan B. Li S. Duan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4269-4277Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were subcloned into the HindIII/KpnI, XhoI/KpnI, or NotI/XbaI sites of pEGFP-N1 or pRcCMV2 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). All of the plasmids were sequenced. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human U2-OS cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in McCoy's 5α medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified air atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transfection, 1.0 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Falcon, Corning, NY). 1 μg of pSUPER-BP5 or pSUPER DNA was transfected into cells following a previously reported method (23Duan C. Ding J. Li Q. Tsai W. Pozios K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15274-15279Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, a mixture containing 1 μg of pCMV-IGFBP plasmid and 1 μg of pSUPER-BP5, empty pCMV, and/or pSUPER was added. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed and incubated with fresh serum-free medium for 48 h. At the end of the incubation, the conditioned media and total RNA were prepared for further analysis. Western Blot and Northern Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (0.45-μm pore size; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Ligand blot analysis was performed using digoxigenin-labeled IGF-I following published procedure (24Shimizu M. Swanson P. Hara A. Dickhoff W.W. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2003; 132: 103-111Google Scholar). Immunoblot was performed following a published method using a GFP antibody (25Duan C. Liimatta M.B. Bottum O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37147-37153Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions and was quantified by measuring UV absorption at 260 nm. RNA samples were size-fractionated in 1.2% agarose gels, blotted, and fixed onto Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed using [32P]dCTP-labeled (ICN, Irvine, CA) human IGFBP-5 or IGFBP-4 cDNA probes as reported previously (26Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Google Scholar). Labeled GAPDH cDNA was used as a control. The band densities were quantified by scanning the autoradiographs and using Quantity One quantitation software (Bio-Rad). IGFBP-5 mRNA levels were standardized by the levels of GAPDH mRNA and expressed as a percentage of the wild type cell control group. Biological Assays—The effect of IGFBP-5 knock-down on cell proliferation was determined by bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling assay as described previously except that BrdU was added in the final 4 h (27Duan C. Bauchat J.R. Hsieh T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 15-23Google Scholar). The result was expressed as the BrdU labeling index (percentage of BrdU-labeled cells in total cells counted). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured following a published method (28Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 680-687Google Scholar) using a kit from Sigma. Briefly, the cells were rinsed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40 in 1 mm MgCl2), and sonicated for 10 s. The reaction mixture (1 ml) containing the phosphatase substrate was added to 200 μl of cell lysate. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 12 μl of 1 n NaOH, and absorbance was read at 405 nm. Alkaline phosphatase activities were calculated using p-nitrophenol as a standard. The results, normalized by the total protein level, are expressed as percentages of the wild type cell control group. Cell death was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice and incubated in a wet chamber at 37 °C for 1 h with the TUNEL reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped by rinsing slides with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were counter-stained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI. Omission of the enzyme in the TUNEL reaction was used as a negative control, and cells treated with DNase I were used as a positive control. Statistical Analysis—The values are presented as means ± S.E. Differences among groups were analyzed by the Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significance difference test, using Statview (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. siRNA Interference of IGFBP-5—The effect of the IGFBP-5 siRNA in silencing the IGFBP-5 gene in human U2-OS cells was examined by directly measuring changes in IGFBP-5 mRNA as well as changes in secreted IGFBP-5 protein levels. Transfection of cells with the pSUPER-BP5 plasmid resulted in a significant decrease in the level of IGFBP-5 mRNA, whereas mock transfection with the empty pSUPER plasmid had no such effect (Fig. 1A). This effect was specific because the IGFBP-5 siRNA did not change the levels of IGFBP-4 mRNA, a structurally related protein, or GAPDH mRNA, a housekeeping gene (Fig. 1A). Results from three independent experiments indicated a 75% reduction (p < 0.05) in IGFBP-5 mRNA abundance by siRNA interference (Fig. 1B). Likewise, ligand blot analysis of the conditioned media revealed a 71% decrease (p < 0.05) in IGFBP-5 protein levels (Fig. 1, C and D). This is likely an underestimation because the autoradiography was overexposed to appreciate any IGFBP-5 signal in the pSUPER-BP5-transfected group. Therefore, IGFBP-5 siRNA can specifically and efficiently knock-down IGFBP-5 expression in human U2-OS cells. Effects of IGFBP-5 siRNA Interference on Cell Proliferation, Differentiation, and Apoptosis—We next investigated the impact of the IGFBP-5 knock-down on U2-OS cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 2A, RNA interference of IGFBP-5 had no significant effect on BrdU labeling index. To prove that these cells were capable of responding to a mitogen, pSUPER and pSUPER-BP5-transfected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. IGF-I treatment increased the BrdU index from 31 + 1.3 to 43.4 ± 2.3% (p < 0.05) in the pSUPER-transfected cells. In the pSUPER-BP5-transfected cells, IGF-I increased the BrdU index from 33.1 ± 1.9 to 42.6 ± 1.5% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the lack of effect on cell proliferation, the pSUPERBP5-transfected cells had significantly lower alkaline phosphatase activity than that of the pSUPER group (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the loss of IGFBP-5 impairs U2-OS cell differentiation. During these experiments, we noticed a consistent reduction in cell number in the pSUPER-BP5-transfected group. To determine whether IGFBP-5 knock-down leads to elevated apoptosis, TUNEL assays were performed. Knock-down of IGFBP-5 resulted in a marked increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 3A). These TUNEL-positive cells exhibited morphological characteristics of apoptotic cells, including nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation that presumably represented cells in the late stage of the apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Quantitative analysis indicated that the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in pSUPER-BP5-transfected cells (2.93 ± 0.55%) was significantly higher than that of the pSUPER-transfected group, which is 0.30 + 0.01% (p < 0.05; Fig. 3C). These data suggest that endogenous IGFBP-5 plays a role in maintaining U2-OS cell survival and differentiation but has a limited effect on proliferation. Rescuing IGFBP-5 Knock-down-induced Apoptosis by Overexpressing a siRNA-resistant IGFBP-5 Mutant—To prove that the elevated apoptosis in the IGFBP-5 knock-down group was indeed due to the loss of IGFBP-5, a chimeric IGFBP (termed as IGFBP-545), in which the siRNA-targeted IGFBP-5 middle domain was replaced with that of IGFBP-4, was generated and subcloned into the pCMV mammalian expression vector. U2-OS cells were co-transfected with pSUPER-BP5 and pCMV-IGFBP-545. Northern blotting analysis revealed the presence of two transcripts in the transfected cells: one is ∼6 kb, corresponding to the size of endogenous IGFBP-5 mRNA, and the other is about 1.1 kb, corresponding to the size of the transcript derived from the IGFBP-545 transgene (Fig. 4A). Results from three independent experiments indicated that IGFBP-5 siRNA caused 74 and 75% reduction (p < 0.05) in the endogenous IGFBP-5 mRNA abundance in the absence and presence of IGFBP-545 (Fig. 4B), respectively. Although the pSUPER-BP5 efficiently reduced the 6-kb IGFBP-5 mRNA levels, it did not change the levels of the IGFBP-545 mRNA (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that IGFBP-545 is resistant to IGFBP-5 siRNA, and expression of IGFBP-545 does not affect the knock-down of IGFBP-5 by pSUPER-BP5. To show that IGFBP-545 retains the IGF binding capability and to compare its IGF binding to that of native IGFBP-5, IGFBP-545 and IGFBP-5 were C-terminally fused with EGFP and introduced into U2-OS cells. Cells transfected with the empty pCMV-EGFP vector were used as a control. Immunoblot analysis of the media conditioned by these cells indicated the presence of a 55-kDa EGFP fusion protein in the pCMVIGFBP-5-EGFP-transfected group and a 53-kDa EGFP fusion protein in the pCMV-IGFBP-545-EGFP-transfected group (Fig. 5A). A 24-kDa EGFP protein was detected in the empty vector-transfected group (Fig. 5A). Ligand blot analysis revealed that IGFBP-5-EGFP and IGFBP-545-EGFP, but not EGFP, were capable of IGF binding (Fig. 5B). Densitometry analysis of the ligand blot and immunoblot results indicates that IGFBP-545-EGFP and IGFBP-5-EGFP bind to IGF-I to a similar degree (Fig. 5C). Next, the rescue effect of reintroducing IGFBP-545 on apoptosis was examined. As shown in Fig. 6A, compared with the pSUPER group, there were significantly more TUNEL-positive cells in the pSUPER-BP5-transfected group (460.1 ± 83.5% of the pSUPER control, p < 0.05). The basal level (100%) in the pSUPER group was 1.03% TUNEL-positive cells/total cells. Co-transfection with pCMV-IGFBP-545 and pSUPER reduced apoptosis to the basal levels (133.3 ± 31.5% of the pSUPER control). Expression of IGFBP-545 alone did not significantly increase cell death (171.8 ± 60.5% of the pSUPER control group). Transfection of cells with the pCMV-IGFBP-5 (wild type) construct had no rescuing effect (Fig. 6B). To show that the rescue effect of IGFBP-545 was not due to any role of the IGFBP-4 L domain, we transfected the cells with pCMVIGFBP-4. Overexpression of IGFBP-4 had no effect on the IGFBP-5 knock-down-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C). Overexpression of IGFBP-4 in the mock transfected cells resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, probably by binding to endogenously produced IGFs and inhibiting their actions. Exogenous IGFBP-5 Increases Apoptosis by Inhibiting IGF Actions—We also attempted to “rescue” the IGFBP-5 knockdown-induced apoptosis by adding pure, recombinant IGFBP-5 protein to U2-OS cells transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-BP5. As shown in Fig. 7A, knock-down of IGFBP-5 resulted in a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (313 ± 21.1% of the pSUPER control, p < 0.05). Addition of purified IGFBP-5 (400 ng/ml), however, not only failed to attenuate the IGFBP-5 knock-down-induced apoptosis, it caused a higher rate of apoptosis (472.5 ± 23.1% of the control group; p < 0.05). Also, the addition of IGFBP-5 to the mock transfected cells resulted in a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells (320 ± 38.5% of the control group; p < 0.05). These results indicate that exogenously added IGFBP-5 increases apoptosis in U2-OS cells. Because U2-OS cells are known to synthesize and secrete IGF-I and IGF-II (29Okazaki R. Conover C.A. Harris S.A. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 788-795Google Scholar), we postulated that exogenously added IGFBP-5 may increase apoptosis by sequestering the action of endogenously produced IGFs, which are well known survival factors (8Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Google Scholar). To test this idea, exogenous IGF-I and IGFBP-5 were added to the cells at a 4:1 molar ratio. As shown in Fig. 7B, the addition of IGF-I in excess abolished the IGFBP-5-induced elevation in apoptosis. These data support the idea that exogenous IGFBP-5 increases apoptosis by sequestering IGF actions. In this study, we have determined the roles of endogenous IGFBP-5 in human osteoblastic cells by employing the siRNA gene silencing approach. Our results indicate that endogenous IGFBP-5 is important for maintaining bone cell survival and differentiation. This conclusion is supported by the following observations. First, knock-down of IGFBP-5 leads to a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells. Loss of IGFBP-5 also resulted in a significant decrease in alkaline phosphate activity but had no effect in either basal or IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in U2-OS cells. Furthermore, expression of a siRNA interference-resistant IGFBP-5 mutant, but not native IGFBP-5 or IGFBP-4, rescued IGFBP-5 knock-down-induced apoptosis. Although there is no previous report on the effect of IGFBP-5 in regulating bone cell survival/apoptosis, the regulatory role of endogenous IGFBP-5 in bone cell differentiation agrees with previous studies using the addition/overexpression of IGFBP-5 approach (11Mohan S.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3955-3962Google Scholar). Our loss-of-function study suggests that endogenous IGFBP-5 plays a limited role, if any, in DNA synthesis in these cells. Previous studies by several groups indicated that exogenously administered or overexpressed IGFBP-5 either potentiates or inhibits DNA synthesis and/or cell proliferation in human or rodent osteoblastic cells (1Bautista C.M. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 756-763Google Scholar, 2Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 213-218Google Scholar, 10Andress D.L.

The different findings on the mitogenic activity of IGFBP-5 could be due to the different experimental approaches. In the present study, we explored the physiological role of endogenous IGFBP-5 through a loss-of-function approach, whereas all previous studies examined the biological effects of exogenous or overexpressed IGFBP-5. In addition, we measured the mitogenic effect of IGFBP-5 by immunocytochemical detection of BrdU-labeled mitotic cells after 4 h of BrdU incubation, whereas others used [3H]thymidine incorporation assays and longer incubation times. Because of the presence of IGFBP-5 protease(s) in these cells and because the cleaved IGFBP-5 fragments can stimulate DNA synthesis through IGF-independent actions (11Mohan S. Nakao Y. Honda Y. Landale E. Leser U. Dony C. Lang K. Baylink D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20424-20431Google Scholar, 16Miyakoshi N. Richman C. Kasukawa Y. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin.

Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Google Scholar), interpretation of data from assays using long incubation times may not be as straightforward as previously believed. Because the siRNA interference depleted only 75% of the endogenous IGFBP-5, it is also conceivable that the remaining IGFBP-5 may be sufficient for maintaining cell growth. A novel and intriguing finding made in this study is that although endogenous IGFBP-5 is required for optimal cell survival, exogenously added IGFBP-5 has a pro-apoptotic effect in human osteosarcoma cells. Both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities have been reported for IGFBP-5 in nonskeletal cell types. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that IGFBP-5 increases/induces apoptosis when added to mammary gland/cells and prostate cells (30Flint D.J. Knight C.H. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 41-48Google Scholar, 31Tonner E. Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Logan A. Flint D.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5101-5107Google Scholar, 32Tonner E. Allan G. Shkreta L. Webster J.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 675-682Google Scholar). Butt et al. (38Butt A.J. Dickson K.A. McDougall F. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29676-29685Google Scholar) have reported that expression of IGFBP-5 in human breast cancer cells caused growth arrest and induced apoptosis. They further showed that the IGFBP-5-induced increase in apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in the pro-apoptotic protein bax and a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2. In contrary to the pro-apoptotic effects of IGFBP-5 in mammary/breast cancer cells, overexpression of IGFBP-5 in mouse C2 myoblasts through stable transfection enhanced cell survival under low serum conditions (39James P.L. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Google Scholar). The IGFBP-5 overexpressing cells are more resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis (40Meadows K.A. Holly J.M. Stewart C.E. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 183: 330-337Google Scholar). A recent paper reported that overexpression of wild type and a non-IGF-binding mutant form of IGFBP-5 increased survival and decreased apoptosis in C2 myoblasts, suggesting that IGFBP-5 may promote myoblast cell survival through a ligand-independent mechanism (41Cobb L.J. Salih D.A. Gonzalez I. Tripathi G. Carter E.J. Lovett F. Holding C. Pell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1737-1746Google Scholar). Likewise, two studies in Hs578T human breast cancer cells indicated that IGFBP-5 inhibits ceramide-induced apoptosis (42Perks C.M. Bowen S. Gill Z.P. Newcomb P.V. Holly J.M. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 75: 652-664Google Scholar, 43McCaig C. Perks C.M. Holly J.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 84: 784-794Google Scholar). Although the possibility that IGFBP-5 may play opposing roles in cell death in different cell types cannot be excluded, our data raise the possibility that these contradictory findings may be in part attributed to the different effects of exogenously added or endogenously expressed IGFBP-5. The opposite biological actions observed with endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-5 are intriguing but also puzzling. Butt et al. (38Butt A.J. Dickson K.A. McDougall F. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29676-29685Google Scholar) have reported that although overexpression of IGFBP-5 in human breast cancer cells increased apoptosis, exogenously added IGFBP-5 had no such effect. It was unclear whether the exogenously added IGFBP-5 was degraded in those systems. We speculated that the pro-apoptotic action of exogenously added IGFBP-5 is due to its ability to bind extracellular IGFs and modulate the interaction between IGFs and their cell surface receptors. IGFs are well known survival factors for a wide variety of cell types (8Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Google Scholar), and U2-OS cells have been shown to synthesize and secrete both IGF-I and IGF-II (29Okazaki R. Conover C.A. Harris S.A. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 788-795Google Scholar). Because the IGF-IR mediates the biological actions of the IGFs, exogenously added IGFBP-5 may bind to IGFs and block their actions. This notion is well supported by our observation that the addition of exogenous IGF-I in excess abolishes the pro-apoptotic action of exogenous IGFBP-5. It is also in consistent with the finding that overexpression of IGFBP-4 increases apoptosis in these cells. Although the pro-apoptotic action of exogenously added IGFBP-5 can be rationally explained by its interaction with IGFs, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the anti-apoptotic activity of endogenous IGFBP-5 is not clear at present. The opposing biological actions of exogenous and endogenous IGFBP-5 are reminiscent to those of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). PTHrP, a secreted protein, has been shown to enter the nucleus and influence cellular events in an intracrine fashion (44Massfelder T. Dann P. Wu T.L. Vasavada R. Helwig J.J. Stewart A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13630-13635Google Scholar, 45Massfelder T. Taesch N. Endlich N. Eichinger A. Escande B. Endlich K. Barthelmebs M. Helwig J.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 707-718Google Scholar). When targeted to the nucleus, PTHrP stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation; the same PTHrP inhibits cell proliferation when it is present in the extracellular environment and interacts with its cell surface receptor (44Massfelder T. Dann P. Wu T.L. Vasavada R. Helwig J.J. Stewart A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13630-13635Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 contains a functional nuclear localization sequence in its C-terminal domain and is found in the nuclear compartment of cultured beast cancer cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and MG63 osteogenic sarcoma cells (46Schedlich L.J.

Recently, we have shown that the IGFBP-5 N-terminal domain possesses intrinsic transactivation activity and that this activity is ligand-independent (49Xu Q. Li S. Zhao Y. Maures T. Yin P. Duan C. Cir. Res. 2004; 94: e46-e54Google Scholar). Preliminary studies using IGFBP-EGFP fusion proteins have shown that overexpressed IGFBP-545-EGFP, but not IGFBP-4-EGFP, is targeted to the nucleus in U2-OS cells (data not shown). It is possible that the nuclear targeting of IGFBP-5 may play a role in the anti-apoptotic effect observed with the endogenous IGFBP-5. Future studies are needed to determine whether the anti-apoptotic activity of endogenous IGFBP-5 is due to its nuclear targeting. In conclusion, this study has elucidated a novel role of endogenous IGFBP-5 in regulating human osteoblast cell survival and differentiation. The results of this study suggest that endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-5 exhibits opposing biological actions in these cells. Our current understanding of the biological actions of IGFBP-5 and other IGFBPs is in large part derived from studies using exogenous proteins. The finding on the opposing biological actions of exogenous and endogenous IGFBP-5 underscores the necessity and utility of studying IGFBP functions through loss-of-function approaches. This study has also provided necessary information and a useful model cell system to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IGFBP-5 actions in regulating cell survival.

https://openalex.org/W1982160526,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from a t(9,22) translocation, producing the p210BCR-ABL oncoprotein, a tyrosine kinase that causes transformation and chemotherapy resistance. To further understand mechanisms mediating chemotherapy resistance, we identified 556 differentially regulated genes in HL-60 cells stably expressing p210BCR-ABLversus those expressing an empty vector using cDNA macro- and oligonucleotide microarrays. These BCR-ABL-regulated gene products play diverse roles in cellular function including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, intracellular signaling, transcription, and cellular adhesion. In particular, we identified up-regulation of the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and further explored the mechanism for its up-regulation. In HL-60/BCR-ABL and K562 cells (expressing p210BCR-ABL), abundant cytoplasmic Hsp70 expression was detected by immunoblot analysis. Moreover, cells isolated from bone marrow aspirates of patients in different stages of CML (chronic, aggressive, and blast crisis) express Hsp70. Expression of p210BCR-ABL in BCR-ABL negative cells induced transcription of the proximal Hsp70 promoter. Mutational analysis mapped the major p210BCR-ABL responsive element to a high affinity 5′(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3′ “GATA” response element (GATA-RE) that binds GATA-1 in CML cells. The GATA-RE was sufficient to confer p210BCR-ABL- and p185BCR-ABL-mediated trans-activation to an inert promoter. Short interfering RNA mediated “knockdown” of Hsp70 expression in K562 cells induced marked sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Together these findings indicate that BCR-ABL confers chemotherapeutic resistance through intracellular signaling to the GATA-RE element found in the promoter region of the anti-apoptotic Hsp70 protein. We suggest that down-regulation of the GATA-Hsp70 pathway may be useful in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant CML. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from a t(9,22) translocation, producing the p210BCR-ABL oncoprotein, a tyrosine kinase that causes transformation and chemotherapy resistance. To further understand mechanisms mediating chemotherapy resistance, we identified 556 differentially regulated genes in HL-60 cells stably expressing p210BCR-ABLversus those expressing an empty vector using cDNA macro- and oligonucleotide microarrays. These BCR-ABL-regulated gene products play diverse roles in cellular function including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, intracellular signaling, transcription, and cellular adhesion. In particular, we identified up-regulation of the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and further explored the mechanism for its up-regulation. In HL-60/BCR-ABL and K562 cells (expressing p210BCR-ABL), abundant cytoplasmic Hsp70 expression was detected by immunoblot analysis. Moreover, cells isolated from bone marrow aspirates of patients in different stages of CML (chronic, aggressive, and blast crisis) express Hsp70. Expression of p210BCR-ABL in BCR-ABL negative cells induced transcription of the proximal Hsp70 promoter. Mutational analysis mapped the major p210BCR-ABL responsive element to a high affinity 5′(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3′ “GATA” response element (GATA-RE) that binds GATA-1 in CML cells. The GATA-RE was sufficient to confer p210BCR-ABL- and p185BCR-ABL-mediated trans-activation to an inert promoter. Short interfering RNA mediated “knockdown” of Hsp70 expression in K562 cells induced marked sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Together these findings indicate that BCR-ABL confers chemotherapeutic resistance through intracellular signaling to the GATA-RE element found in the promoter region of the anti-apoptotic Hsp70 protein. We suggest that down-regulation of the GATA-Hsp70 pathway may be useful in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant CML.

Talpaz M. Estrov Z. O'Brien S. Kurzrock R. Kantarjian H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). CML is caused by a reciprocal t(9,22) translocation of c-abl from chromosome 9 to the break-point cluster region (bcr) gene on chromosome 22 (1Faderl S. Talpaz M. Estrov Z. O'Brien S. Kurzrock R.

In 95% of CML cases, translocation involves the major bcr, leading to generation of the 210-kDa BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein (p210BCR-ABL). A similar BCR-ABL translocation is also be found in 20–30% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 5% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3Raitano A.B. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F201-F216PubMed Google Scholar, 4Melo J.V. Blood. 1996; 88: 2375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, the serine-threonine kinase domain from BCR partially replaces the inhibitory NH2-terminal Src homology 3 domain of ABL, producing a fusion protein with constitutive ABL tyrosine kinase activity (3Raitano A.B.

Moreover, BCR-ABL signaling is required to actively maintain cellular viability. For example, down-regulation of BCR-ABL expression (10Wilda M. Fuchs U. Wossmann W. Borkhardt A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 11McGahon A. Bissonnette R. Schmitt M. Cotter K.M. Green D.R. Cotter T.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or inhibition of its ABL tyrosine kinase activity using the 2-phenlyaminopyridmidine inhibitor, imatinib (STI571), induces apoptosis in vitro and remissions during the chronic phase of CML in the clinic (10Wilda M.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A body of work has shown that BCR-ABL regulates diverse signaling pathways including p21ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C (PKC) (13Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Jak-STAT (3Raitano A.B. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 16Lu Y. Jamieson L. Brasier A.R. Fields A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4777-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The relationships of these signaling pathways to specific cellular responses are still being elucidated. Perhaps best understood is the p21ras/Raf pathway in mediating cellular transformation by BCR-ABL. Inhibition of p21ras, either by administration of antisense oligonucleotides or microinjection of blocking antibodies, prevents expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene, thereby blocking cellular transformation (reviewed in Ref. 17Zou X. Calame K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18141-18144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).A hallmark of BCR-ABL-expressing cells is the profound resistance to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis (13Jamieson L.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Chemotherapy-induced cell death involves proteolytic cleavage of cysteine proteases, called caspases, whose activation can be triggered by cytochrome c release from mitochondria (20Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds apoptotic protease activation factor (Apaf)-1, inducing its oligomerization to form the “apoptosome” (21Adams J.M. Cory S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), an enzymatically competent Apaf-1·procaspase-9 complex that cleaves procaspase-3, thereby committing the cell to autolysis.BCR-ABL causes chemotherapy resistance, at least in part, by interfering with the caspase activation pathway at multiple steps. Previous studies have shown that Ph+ cells isolated either during CML blast crisis or after ectopic BCR-ABL expression release diminished amounts of cytochrome c into the cytosol after exposure to high dose Ara-C or etoposide (22Martins L.M. Mesner P.W. Kottke T.J. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Tung J.S. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. Takahashi A. McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H.

Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the biochemical level, BCR-ABL-transformed cells express increased amounts of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Bcl-xL, which prevents Bax insertion into the outer mitochrondial membrane, reducing chemotherapy-induced cytochrome c release (23Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung K.C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that BCR-ABL signaling through the PKCι-NF-κB pathway is also required for resistance to paclitaxel (Taxol)-induced apoptosis (16Lu Y. Jamieson L. Brasier A.R. Fields A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4777-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor that activates expression of several inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, polypeptides that bind and inactivate caspases as well as inducing ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the RHG proteins (Reaper, HID, and Grim, Ref. 24Olson M.R. Holley C.L. Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4028-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest that BCR-ABL may induce chemotherapy resistance by controlling expression of proteins that antagonize caspase activation at multiple points.Several studies have begun to identify BCR-ABL-activated genomic programs, focusing on BCR-ABL-activated genes important in cell cycle regulation or molecular signatures (25Jena N. Deng M. Sicinska E. Sicinski P. Daley G.Q. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 535-541PubMed Google Scholar, 26Salesse S. Verfaillie C.M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Nowicki M.O. Pawlowski P. Fischer T. Hess G. Pawlowski T. Skorski T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3952-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, whether BCR-ABL activates other genetic targets controlling anti-apoptosis has not been completely resolved. Here we apply discovery based tools to investigate the effects of BCR-ABL on gene expression. Differential expression of a variety of signaling kinases, transcription factors, cell surface receptors, and adhesion molecules was observed in HL-60 cells stably expressing p210BCR-ABLversus empty vector controls. Further investigation focused on the BCR-ABL induced up-regulation of heat shock protein (Hsp)-70 kDa isoform, an anti-apoptotic protein known to bind and inhibit Apaf-1, apoptosis inducing factor, and inhibit the apoptosis signal-inducing kinase-1 (Refs. 28Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat.

Ko Y.G. Kim S. Choi E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7721-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After Hsp70 up-regulation was validated in K562 cells and bone marrow aspirates from CML patients, subsequent experiments mapped sequences responsible for BCR-ABL-mediated transactivation to a high affinity GATA response element (GATA-RE) located in the proximal Hsp70 promoter between –82 and –58 nt. Finally, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated down-regulation of Hsp70 expression sensitized K562 cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Together these findings indicate that p210BCR-ABL transactivates the GATA-RE in the Hsp70 promoter, leading to up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Hsp70 gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment—Human K562 erythroleukemia (16Lu Y. Jamieson L. Brasier A.R. Fields A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4777-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma (31Brasier A.R. Lu M. Hai T. Lu Y. Boldogh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32080-32093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia cells stably transfected with BCR-ABL (HL-60/BCR-ABL) or empty vector (HL-60/Neo) were cultured as described (23Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung K.C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, paclitaxel (Sigma) was resuspended in Me2SO and added to a final concentration of 1 μm.In some experiments, cells were isolated from leukemic bone marrow aspirates. Bone marrow aspirates were obtained after informed consent was obtained under an institutional review board-approved protocol at the time of diagnosis or treatment on the Adult Leukemia Service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Fractions of mononuclear cells or granulocytes were isolated on double Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (32English D. Andersen B.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), washed with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), lysed in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride under reducing conditions, reacted with iodoacetamide, dialyzed into 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and lyophilized as described (33Kaufmann S.H. Mclaughlin S.J. Kastan M. Liu L.F. Karp J.E. Burke P.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3534-3543PubMed Google Scholar).Membrane Based cDNA Macroarrays—Total RNA was extracted from control (HL-60/Neo) or p210BCR-ABL-expressing (HL-60/BCR-ABL) cells by acid guanidium-phenol extraction (TRI Reagent, Sigma) and treated with DNase. Five micrograms were reverse transcribed in the presence of 35 μCi of [α-33P]dATP and cDNA was purified by column chromatography (Chroma spin-200, Clontech). Atlas 1.2 Arrays (Clontech) were hybridized with 106 cpm/ml of probe at 68 °C and washed as recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette and relative changes in hybridization intensity were determined by AtlasImage 1.01 software (Clontech). Comparisons of mRNA populations between control and p210BCR-ABL-expressing cells were performed with two different sets of Atlas Array membrane lots in two independent experiments.For each gene, local background was subtracted from the total hybridization intensity and the average signal intensity was determined for duplicate spots. To compare differences in gene expression between arrays, background subtracted average intensity was normalized to that of housekeeping genes. Only those genes that showed an average 3.5-fold up-regulation or down-regulation across duplicate membranes were further considered.High Density Oligonucleotide Arrays—Four independent RNA samples were prepared from the HL-60/Neo and the HL-60/BCR-ABL-transfected cells for hybridization to the Hu95A GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using total RNA (10–25 μg), a T7-(dT)24 oligomer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Second strand synthesis, target RNA labeling, and hybridization were as previously described (34Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9044-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Gene Chip arrays were scanned using a Gene Array Scanner (Hewlett-Packard) and analyzed using the Gene Chip Analysis Suite 4 software (Affymetrix Inc.). The average difference statistic was retrieved for quantification of mRNA abundance in those samples in which the absolute call indicated that the gene was present.Oligonucleotide Microarray Data Analysis—Reproducibility of the four independent microarrays was determined by calculating the correlation coefficient for the log-transformed average difference values for the probe sets in each array (34Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9044-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For each pairwise comparison, the mean correlation coefficient was 0.945 ± 0.024 (n = 6) in the HL-60/Neo data sets, and 0.977 ± 0.010 (n = 6) for the HL-60/BCR-ABL data sets, indicating that the measurements were highly reproducible (Table I). For comparison of the fluorescence intensity (average difference) values among multiple experiments, the average difference values for each “experimental” GeneChip were scaled to that of the “base” GeneChip (34Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9044-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Genes differentially expressed were identified by one-way ANOVA with replicates comparing the average difference values of a probe sets in HL-60/Neo versus HL-60/BCR-ABL. Genes (probe sets) with a p value (Pr(F)) < 0.0001 were selected for further analysis. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (34Zhang Y.

Briefly, cells were counted and equal numbers were harvested and lysed directly into Laemmli sample buffer. Equal volumes of sample were then fractionated by a 5–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20. Blots were then probed with the indicated primary antibody; immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) or, where indicated, near-infrared fluorescence (Odyssey Imaging System, LiCor BioSciences).Plasmids—The –259/+37 Hsp70/LUC promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed by PCR of HL60 genomic DNA using the upstream primer –259 5′-ACGGATCCCACCGCCACTCCCCCTTC-3′, and the Hsp70 downstream primer 5′-AAAAAGCTTGTGGACTGTCGCAGCAGCTC-3′ (HindIII site underlined). The restricted gelpurified PCR product was ligated into pOLUC reporter digested with the same endonucleases (35Brasier A.R. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 9.6.10-9.6.13Google Scholar). A series of 5′ deletions were constructed by PCR using Hsp70 (–259/+37)/LUC as template with the upstream primers –200, 5′-GTGGATCCCAGAAGACTCTG-3′; –163, 5′-GCGGATCCCTGGCCTCTGATT-3′; –123, 5′-GGGGATCCACGGGAGGCGAAA-3′; –82, 5′-CCTGGATCCCTCATCGAGCTC-3′; –58, 5′-GATTGGATCCGAAGGGAAAAGG-3′, and the Hsp70 downstream primer. Each 5′ deletion was digested with BamHI (site is underlined) and HindIII, gel purified, and ligated into pOLUC. The site-directed mutation of the GATA binding element was constructed by PCR SOEing (36Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) using the sense primer 5′-GAGCTCGGTCTCAGGCTCAGGATA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCTGAGCCTGAGACCGAG-3′ (mutations underlined) with the Hsp70 downstream primer.The multimeric GATA (WT) and GATA (Mut)-driven reporter was constructed by annealing the sense and antisense oligonucleotides as: GATA (WT): sense, GATCGAGCTCGGTGATTGGCTCAGAA and anti-sense, CTCGAGCCACTAACCGAGTCTTCTAG; GATA (Mut): sense, GATCGAGCTCGGTCTCAGGCTCAGAA and antisense, CTCGAGCCAGAGTCCGAGTCTTCTAG. Duplex oligonucleotides were then phosphorylated, ligated with T4 DNA ligase, 3 copies were ligated into BamHI linearized –59/+22 rAGT/LUC, driven by the inert angiotensinogen TATA box (35Brasier A.R. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 9.6.10-9.6.13Google Scholar). pCMV-FLAG BCR-ABL expression vectors were constructed by ligating the BCR-ABL coding sequences into pCMV-Tag plasmid (37Cortez D. Kadlec L. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified by ion exchange chromatography (Qiagen) and cloned inserts were sequenced to confirm authenticity.Cell Transfection and Reporter Assays—Transient transfections in K562 cells were carried out using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen). For reporter plasmids, 4 to 10 μg of plasmid DNA was resuspended into 0.5 ml of OPTI-MEM® I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen), mixed with an equal volume of medium containing 10 μl of DMRIE-C Reagent, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min to allow lipid-DNA complex formation. Logarithmically growing K562 cells (2 × 106 cells) were centrifuged, resuspended in 0.5 ml of reduced serum medium, and added to the lipid-DNA complex and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 5 h. After transfection, growth medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum) was added and the cells were incubated overnight. For reporter assays, cells were harvested at the indicated time points and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared and independently measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (35Brasier A.R. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 9.6.10-9.6.13Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter activity was normalized to the internal control of β-galactosidase activity to control for differences in transfection efficiency.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear proteins were purified over a sucrose cushion (31Brasier A.R. Lu M. Hai T. Lu Y. Boldogh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32080-32093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) normalized for protein concentration by the Coomassie G-250 assay (Bio-Rad). The GATA (WT) monomeric duplex was radiolabeled with Klenow polymerase and purified by gel filtration chromatography. DNA-binding reactions were carried out in a mixture of 20 μg of nuclear proteins, 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dA-dT), and 20,000 cpm of α-32P-labeled double-stranded GATA (WT) probe in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and then fractionated by 6% nondenaturing PAGE containing 2% glycerol. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak X-AR film at –70 °C. Competition was performed by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of nonradioactive double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor at the time of addition of the radioactive probe. For supershift, anti-GATA-1 antibody was added to the gel shift reaction and incubated on ice for 1 h prior to fractionation by nondenaturing PAGE.Apoptosis—Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin using an Annexin V-Phycoerythrin Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, 5 × 105 washed cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in annexin V-binding buffer. Cell suspensions were then incubated with annexin V-phycoerythrin at 1 μg/ml and 7 aminoactinomycin D at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 25 min at room temperature in the dark. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FACScan) analysis (38Dive C. Gregory C.D. Phipps D.J. Evans D.L. Milner A.E. Wyllie A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1133: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).SiRNA-mediated Hsp-70 “Knockdown”—Various concentrations from 50 to 200 nm Hsp70 or lamin A/C siRNA (custom SMART pool, HSPA1L-NM,43005346, and siRNA CONTROl, Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO) were substituted for the reporter plasmid and transfected into logarithmically growing K562 cells using DIMRIE-C as described above. After 5 h, growth medium was added and cells were returned to culture in the absence or presence of paclitaxel (1 μm final concentration) for the times indicated.RESULTSIdentification of Genes Downstream of the BCR-ABL Pathway—In this study, we initially determined gene expression profiles in HL-60 cells stably expressing p210BCR-ABL because these cells show enhanced Bcl-xL expression and decreased cytochrome c release in response to chemotherapeutic agent administration (23Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung K.C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm stable p210BCR-ABL expression, Western immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-c-Abl antibody. HL-60/BCR-ABL cells express amounts of p210BCR-ABL comparable with Ph+ K562 cells, whereas the HL-60/Neo controls have no detectable BCR-ABL antigen (Fig. 1). To identify genomic targets of p210BCR-ABL we systematically examined differences in mRNA expression by cDNA macroarrays and high density oligonucleotide microarrays. Using membrane-based cDNA macroarrays containing 1,176 sequenced human gene probes, we identified 25 genes whose expression was increased by 3.5-fold (or greater), and 34 genes whose expression was reduced by 3.5-fold (or greater) in duplicate pairwise experiments (Table II)"
https://openalex.org/W2069442142,"Open reading frame 74 (ORF74) of many γ2 -herpesviruses encodes a CXC chemokine receptor. The molecular pharmacological profile of ORF74 from herpesvirus saimiri, ECRF3, is characterized here and compared with that of the well known ORF74 from human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). The ECRF3 receptor bound the so-called ELR (Glu-Leu-Arg) CXC chemokines 125I-CXCL1/GROα, 125I-CXCL6/GCP-2, and 125I-CXCL8/interleukin-8 with high affinity; but in contrast to ORF74 from HHV8, it did not bind the non-ELR CXC chemokine 125I-CXCL10/IP10. Interestingly, the Bmax value for CXCL6/GCP-2 was 3-fold higher than the capacity for maximal binding of CXCL1/GROα to ECRF3 and 85-fold higher than that of CXCL8/interleukin-8, despite similar affinities. Like ORF74 from HHV8, ECRF3 activated a broad range of pathways (Gq, Gi, and G12/13 as well as the cAMP response element-binding protein, NF-κB, NFAT, and serum response element transcription factors) in a ligand-regulated manner, with CXCL6/GCP-2 being the most potent and efficacious agonist. ECRF3 signaled constitutively through Gi and G12/13, but surprisingly not through Gq. At the level of transcription factor activation, the serum response element was activated constitutively by ECRF3, whereas cAMP response element-binding protein, NFAT, and NF-κB were only ligand-regulated. The maximal signaling capacities were similar for the two receptors; however, the ligand-regulated signaling was responsible for the major part of the total ECRF3 signaling and only for a minor part of the total HHV8 ORF74 signaling. The activation pattern of ECRF3 with constitutive activation of some (but not all) of the employed pathways has not been seen before in endogenous or virus-encoded chemokine receptors. The results suggest that the unique ligand selectivity of ECRF3 among ORF74 receptors could reflect differences in the cellular tropism of the γ2-herpesviruses.

Chemokine receptors belong to the family of rhodopsin-like seven-transmembrane (7TM) 1The abbreviations used are: 7TM, seven-transmembrane; PTx, pertussis toxin; ORF74, open reading frame 74; MHV68, murid γ-herpesvirus 68; HHV8, human herpesvirus 8; HVS, herpesvirus saimiri; CXCR, CXC chemokine receptor; IL-8, interleukin-8; NAP-2, neutrophil-activating peptide 2; IP10, interferon-inducible protein 10; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein 2; vCCL2, viral CCL2; vMIP-II, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II; SRE, serum response element; PI, phosphatidylinositol; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; PLC, phospholipase C. 1The abbreviations used are: 7TM, seven-transmembrane; PTx, pertussis toxin; ORF74, open reading frame 74; MHV68, murid γ-herpesvirus 68; HHV8, human herpesvirus 8; HVS, herpesvirus saimiri; CXCR, CXC chemokine receptor; IL-8, interleukin-8; NAP-2, neutrophil-activating peptide 2; IP10, interferon-inducible protein 10; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein 2; vCCL2, viral CCL2; vMIP-II, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II; SRE, serum response element; PI, phosphatidylinositol; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; PLC, phospholipase C. α-helix receptors (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176Google Scholar). Upon activation, the 7TM receptors mainly transduce signals to G-proteins that are divided into four main classes: Gi/o, Gq, Gs, and G12/13. Apart from the odorant receptors, the majority of 7TM receptors (∼43%) activate Gi (2Wong S.K. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 1-12Google Scholar). Most 7TM receptors interact selectively with one G-protein; however, ∼11% of 7TM receptors signal through more than one G-protein (2Wong S.K. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 1-12Google Scholar). Signal transduction of chemokine receptors is mediated mainly by pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive calcium release and chemotaxis pointing at Gi as the principal pathway. A variety of signal transduction pathways initiated by Gi as well as by the βγ-subunits have been described for chemokine receptors (reviewed in Ref. 3Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Google Scholar). Chemokines are divided in two major groups, CC and CXC chemokines, based on the presence or absence of a residue between the first two of four conserved cysteines. The CXC chemokines are divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of an ELR (Glu-Leu-Arg) motif just prior to the first cysteine (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176Google Scholar). The chemokine system has been subject to molecular piracy by certain viruses. Thus, some pox- and herpesviruses encode chemokines and/or chemokine receptors in their genomes (4Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Google Scholar). The virus-encoded chemokine receptors are structurally rather divergent and have in general evolved very different functional properties compared with their human homologs, indicating remarkable evolutionary pressure. The open reading frame 74 (ORF74) receptors constitute one cluster of synthetic genes (all encoded by ORF74) and are shared by many members of the rhadinovirus lineage (γ2-herpesviruses) (Fig. 1) (5Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Google Scholar). Thus, ORF74 receptors have been cloned from murid γ-herpesvirus 68 (ORF74-MHV68), equine herpesvirus 2, human herpesvirus 8 (ORF74-HHV8), herpesvirus saimiri (ECRF3 or ORF74-HVS), and the closely related atheles herpesvirus. The ORF74 family shows the highest structural homology to mammalian CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR) 2, and the functional characterization of ORF74-HHV8 (6Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A.

Virol. 2004; 78: 3343-3351Google Scholar) as being CXC chemokine receptors supports the structural homology. HVS is a T-cell lymphotrophic virus that causes asymptomatic infection in the natural host, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), and fatal lymphoproliferative disease when transmitted to other New World primates and some Old World primates (11Nicholas J. Cameron K.R. Honess R.W. Nature. 1992; 355: 362-365Google Scholar). ECRF3 from HVS was characterized as the first γ-herpesvirus-encoded CXC chemokine receptor by Ahuja and Murphy (9Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Google Scholar), with the most potent agonist being CXCL1/GROα, 2The chemokine nomenclature follows the recommendations of the International Union of Pharmacology (1Murphy P.M.

ORF74 from HHV8 (12Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Google Scholar) is closely related to ECRF3 (Fig. 1) and is probably the best characterized ORF74 receptor. It binds a variety of CXC chemokines; thus, pro-inflammatory and angiogenic ELR CXC chemokines act either as agonists (CXCL1–3/GROα,β,γ) or as neutral ligands (e.g. CXCL8/IL-8), whereas angiostatic non-ELR CXC chemokines act as inverse agonists (CXCL10/interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP10) and CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor 1α). Although CXCL6/granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (GCP-2) is an ELR CXC chemokine, it acts as a partial inverse agonist (13Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Google Scholar). The broad-spectrum chemokine antagonist viral CCL2 (vCCL2)/viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP-II), encoded by HHV8, also inhibits the constitutive activity of ORF74-HHV8 (6Arvanitakis L.

Vascularized tumors develop when ORF74 is transplanted into nude mice (7Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gerhengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Google Scholar), and transgenic expression of ORF74-HHV8 in mice results in Kaposi's sarcoma-like lesions (19Yang T.Y. Chen S.C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M.

Stewart J.P. Timmerman H. Smit M.J. Leurs R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3343-3351Google Scholar), but it does not show constitutive activity. Thus, in general, virus-encoded receptors are more promiscuous in their interaction with (several) ligands and in their exploitation of several signaling pathways compared with their mammalian chemokine receptor homologs (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176Google Scholar, 5Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Google Scholar). The general knowledge of 7TM receptor signal transduction mechanisms and knowledge of the properties of virus-encoded chemokine receptors have developed considerably since the first description of ECRF3 from HVS in 1993 (9Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized ECRF3 on this basis and surprisingly found that it has a very interesting molecular pharmacological phenotype in being constitutively active through Gi and G12/13 (the latter shown by studying the serum response element (SRE) transcription factor in the presence of pathway-specific inhibitors), whereas it activates a broader spectrum of signaling pathways in a ligand-regulated manner, with CXCL6/GCP-2 being the most potent agonist. Materials—The human chemokines were purchased from Peprotech (CXCL6/GCP-2, CXCL1/GROα, CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor 1, and CXCL10/IP10); kindly provided by Dr. Timothy N. C. Wells (Serono Pharmaceutical Research Group, Ares-Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) (vCCL2/vMIP-II); or made in-house by Dr. Thomas P. Boesen through Escherichia coli expression, purification, and refolding (CXCL8/IL-8). The ECRF3 receptor was kindly provided by Dr. John Nicholas (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). ORF74 from HHV8 (GenBank™/EBI accession number U24275) was cloned from a Kaposi's sarcoma skin lesion biopsy taken from a human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected patient (21Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Coulin F. Simmons G. Johnsen A.H. Alouani S. Power C.A. Lüttichau H.R. Gerstoft J. Clapham P.R. Clark L.I. Wells T.N.C. Schwartz T.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1656-1659Google Scholar). LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent and Opti-MEM I (catalog no. 51985-026) were purchased from Invitrogen. LucLite (lyophilized substrate solution) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoiodinated 125I-CXCL8/IL-8 and 125I-CXCL1/GROα, myo-[3H]inositol (PT6-271), [3H]adenine (TRK311), and Bolton-Hunter reagent for iodination of CXCL6/GCP-2 and CXCL10/IP10 were from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (for phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover) and AG-50W-X4 resin (for cAMP assay) were from Bio-Rad. Alumina, imidazole, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and PTx (for cAMP assay) were from Sigma. U-73122, Y-27632, and C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum were from Calbiochem and Merck Biosciences (Nottingham, United Kingdom). Iodination of CXCL6/GCP-2 and CXCL10/IP10—The Bolton-Hunter reagent was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen for 30–60 min. 5–10 μg of chemokine was incubated on ice with 1.5 mCi of Bolton-Hunter reagent in a total volume of 50 μl of 0.1 mm borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.25 ml of H2O supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The labeled chemokines were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Transfections and Tissue Culture—COS-7 cells were grown at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (catalog no. 21885-025, Invitrogen) adjusted with 10% fetal bovine serum, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium adjusted to contain 4500 mg/liter glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin at 10% CO2 and 37 °C. The HEK293 cell medium was modified to contain heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and no penicillin and streptomycin during luciferase-based assays. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (8Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Google Scholar) for the competition binding and PI turnover experiments and by the cationic lipid reagent method with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent in serum-free Opti-MEM I according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the luciferase-based transcription factor experiments. HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (8Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Google Scholar) for the adenylate cyclase inhibition experiments and with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent in serum-free Opti-MEM I according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the luciferase-based transcription factor experiments. Binding Experiments—COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates 1 day after transfection. The number of cells seeded per well was determined by the apparent expression efficiency of the receptors, with the goal of obtaining 5–10% specific binding of the added radioactive ligand. 3–5 × 105 cells/well were used to test specific binding. 2 days after transfection, cells were assayed by competition binding for 3 h at 4 °C using 12 pm125I-CXCL8/IL-8, 125I-CXCL1/GROα, 125I-CXCL6/GCP-2, or 125I-CXCL10/IP10 plus unlabeled ligand in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation, cells were washed quickly four times with 4 °C binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 0.1 μm unlabeled chemokine. Determinations were made in duplicates. Phosphatidylinositol Assay (PI Turnover)—1 day after transfection, COS-7 cells (2.5 × 104/well) were incubated for 24 h with 5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in 0.3 ml/well growth medium. Cells were washed twice with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and were incubated in 0.3 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 90 min in the presence or absence of chemokines. PTx (100 ng/ml) were added 18 h prior to the experiment. Cells were extracted by addition of 1 ml/well 10 mm formic acid, followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. The generated [3H]inositol phosphates were purified on AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (22Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvin R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Google Scholar). Determinations were made in duplicates. Adenylate Cyclase Inhibition Assay (cAMP Assay)—1 day after transfection, HEK293 cells (2.5 × 104/well) were incubated for 24 h with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine in 0.5 ml/well growth medium. Cells were washed twice with 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.75 mm NaH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 ml of the same buffer supplemented with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm) was added together with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (15 μm) to the cells. Ligands were then added, and the reaction was terminated after a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were placed on ice; the medium was removed; and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid supplemented with 0.1 mm cAMP and 0.1 mm ATP for 30 min. The lysis mixtures were loaded onto Dowex columns, which were washed with 2 ml of water, placed on the top of alumina columns, and washed again with 10 ml of water. The alumina columns were eluted with 6 ml of 0.1 m imidazole into 15 ml of scintillation fluid (Highsafe III). Columns were reused up to 15 times. Dowex columns were regenerated by adding 10 ml of 2 n HCl followed by 10 ml of water; the alumina columns were regenerated by adding 2 ml of 1 m imidazole, 10 ml of 0.1 m imidazole, and finally 5 ml of water. The effect of 100 ng/ml PTx was tested by adding it to the cells 18 h before ligand addition. Determinations were made in triplicates. Constitutive SRE, NFAT, and NF-κB cis-Reporting and CREB trans-Reporting Luciferase Assays—Cells were seeded at 35,000 cells/well in culture plates 24 h prior to transfection and were transfected with the cis-reporter plasmid (pSRE-Luc, pNFAT-Luc, or pNF-κB-Luc; 50 ng/well) and the receptor plasmid (0–50 ng/well). For the trans-reporting system, 50 ng/well trans-activator plasmid (pFR-Luc) was added together with 6 ng/well trans-reporter plasmid (pFA2-CREB) and receptor plasmids. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and luminescence was measured in a microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Top-counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after a 10-min incubation in 100 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline together with 100 μl of LucLite substrate. All determinations were made in quadruplicates. Ligand and Inhibitor Modification of Transcription Factor Activity— The cells were transfected with 10 ng/well receptor cDNA and the above-mentioned concentrations of reporter and activator plasmids. Chemokine ligands were added at concentrations ranging from 10–11 to 10–7m for the dose-response curves. Alternatively, a constant concentration (100 nm) was added to the receptor gene dose experiments (see above). In both cases, as well as upon addition of the inhibitors PTx (100 ng/ml) and U-73122 (10 μm) to the CREB, NF-κB, and NFAT transcription factors and of PTx (100 ng/ml), C3 exoenzyme (10 μg/ml), and Y-27623 (10 μm) to the SRE transcription factor, the chemokines/inhibitors were added immediately following transfection, and luminescence was measured 24 h post-transfection as described above. All determinations were made in quadruplicates. Calculations—IC50 and EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression, and Bmax values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism Version 2 software. The CXC Chemokine Binding Profile of ECRF3 Is Limited Exclusively to the ELR Motif-containing CXC Chemokines— Homolog competition binding analysis was performed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells with four radioligands, including two previously described agonists for ECRF3, 125I-CXCL1/GROα and 125I-CXCL8/IL-8 (9Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Google Scholar), together with 125I-CXCL10/IP10 and 125I-CXCL6/GCP-2, which are full and partial inverse agonists for ORF74-HHV8, respectively. All three ELR CXC chemokines (CXCL1/GROα, CXCL8/IL-8, and CXCL6/GCP-2) bound specifically to ECRF3 with high and remarkably similar binding affinities (IC50) of 0.25 ± 0.07, 0.46 ± 0.17, and 0.51 ± 0.21 nm, respectively (Fig. 2, A–C). These affinities resembled the corresponding affinities for ORF74-HHV8 (Fig. 2, A–C). The non-ELR CXC chemokine CXCL10/IP10 displayed no specific binding to ECRF3, in contrast to the high affinity for ORF74-HHV8 (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, large differences in the maximal binding capacities were assessed despite the high and similar binding affinities. Thus, Bmax was 12 ± 2.5 fmol/105 cells for 125I-CXCL1/GROα, whereas it was only 0.4 ± 0.1 fmol/105 cells for 125I-CXCL8/IL-8. In contrast, 125I-CXCL6/GCP-2 displayed a Bmax of 34 ± 6.7 fmol/105 cells, nearly three times higher compared with 125I-CXCL1/GROα and 85 times higher compared with 125I-CXCL8/IL-8. These Bmax values were in striking contrast to the almost similar values for 125I-labeled CXCL1/GROα, CXCL8/IL-8, and CXCL6/GCP-2 for binding to ORF74-HHV8 (33 ± 5.9, 39 ± 6.8, and 26 ± 9.4 fmol/105 cells, respectively), obtained in parallel with the Bmax values for ECRF3. A larger range of ELR as well as non-ELR CXC chemokines was analyzed by heterologous competition binding against 125I-CXCL1/GROα (Table I). All three GRO peptides (CXCL1–3/GROα,β,γ) bound with high affinities to ECRF3, whereas the apparent affinity of CXCL7/NAP-2 was only 155 nm. The non-ELR CXC chemokines CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor 1 and CXCL10/IP10 displayed very low affinities for ECRF3 (1016 and 622 nm, respectively), in agreement with the absence of any specific binding for CXCL10/IP10. Previously, a selection of endogenous CC chemokines was tested (CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL5/RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted), CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and CCL4/MIP-1β) and found not to interact with ECRF3 (9Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Google Scholar). Therefore, no further analysis was performed in our system with respect to endogenous CC chemokines. However, the HHV8-encoded CC chemokine vCCL2/vMIP-II was found to have a surprisingly high affinity (IC50 = 4.1 nm) (Table I) compared with its affinity of 72 nm for ORF74-HHV8 (8Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Google Scholar). In summary, ECRF3 bound a large spectrum of CXC chemokines with affinities varying from 0.4 to 155 nm. The specific binding was, however, strictly limited to the ELR CXC chemokines (no binding of the non-ELR CXC chemokines), in contrast to the broad-spectrum ELR and non-ELR CXC chemokine binding properties of ORF74-HHV8 and ORF74-MHV68 (8Rosenkilde M.M.

As expected from the initial study of ECRF3 identifying CXCL1/GROα as an agonist in Ca2+ release (9Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Google Scholar), this chemokine stimulated ECRF3 with a potency (IC50) of 5.5 nm (Fig. 3) and an efficacy of 2.4-fold stimulation above the basal activity, a phenotype resembling the previously shown agonism (IC50 ∼ 1 nm) of CXCL1/GROα toward ORF74-HHV8 (see Fig. 5B) (8Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Google Scholar). The neutral ligands for ORF74-HHV8, CXCL8/IL-8 and CXCL7/NAP-2, did not influence the Gq activity of ECRF3 at the maximal chosen concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, an inverse agonist for ORF74-HHV8 (13Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Google Scholar), CXCL6/GCP-2, turned out to be the most potent and efficacious agonist with ECRF3, with an EC50 of 0.42 nm and an efficacy of 5.4-fold stimulation above the basal activity (Fig. 3). Two other inverse agonists for ORF74-HHV8, CXCL10/IP10 and vCCL2/vMIP-II, had no effect on the basal activity of ECRF3; however, with respect to antagonizing the agonist-stimulated receptor, vCCL2/vMIP-II (but not CXCL10/IP10) inhibited the CXCL6/GCP-2 (10 nm)-induced activity with a potency of 77 nm (data not shown).Fig. 5PTx does not inhibit the PLC activation of ECRF3. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were used for the PI turnover assays. A, increasing doses of CXCL6/GCP-2 applied to ECRF3 in the absence (•) or presence (○) of 100 ng/ml PTx; B, increasing doses of CXCL1/GROα applied to ORF74-HHV8 in the absence (▪) or presence (□) of 100 ng/ml PTx. All experiments were done in parallel (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Gene dose experiments for ECRF3 performed in parallel with ORF74-HHV8 demonstrated that ECRF3, in contrast to ORF74-HHV8, did not activate Gq in a ligand-independent (constitutive) manner (Fig. 4A). However, a comparison of the maximal ligand-stimulated activities in the gene dose setup indicated that ECRF3 could be stimulated to the same level as ORF74-HHV8 at equivalent DNA concentrations (Fig. 4B). Thus, 100 nm CXCL6/GCP-2 stimulated ECRF3 to the same level to which 100 nm CXCL1/GROα stimulated ORF74-HHV8 (at equivalent DNA concentrations), corresponding to the almost similar Bmax values for CXCL6/GCP-2 binding to ECRF3 and for CXCL1/GROα binding to ORF74-HHV8. In contrast, 100 nm CXCL1/GROα stimulated ECRF3 with lower efficacy, corresponding to the lower Bmax value for CXCL1/GROα binding to ECRF3. Phospholipase C (PLC) is activated mainly through an interaction with the α-subunit from Gq (23Wu D.Q. Lee"
https://openalex.org/W2117753003,"The PutA flavoprotein from Escherichia coli is a transcriptional repressor and a bifunctional enzyme that regulates and catalyzes proline oxidation. PutA represses transcription of genes putA and putP by binding to the control DNA region of the put regulon. The objective of this study is to define and characterize the DNA binding domain of PutA. The DNA binding activity of PutA, a 1320 amino acid polypeptide, has been localized to N-terminal residues 1-261. After exploring a potential DNA-binding region and an N-terminal deletion mutant of PutA, residues 1-90 (PutA90) were determined to contain DNA binding activity and stabilize the dimeric structure of PutA. Cell-based transcriptional assays demonstrate that PutA90 functions as a transcriptional repressor in vivo. The dissociation constant of PutA90 with the put control DNA was estimated to be 110 nm, which is slightly higher than that of the PutA-DNA complex (K(d) approximately 45 nm). Primary and secondary structure analysis of PutA90 suggested the presence of a ribbon-helix-helix DNA binding motif in residues 1-47. To test this prediction, we purified and characterized PutA47. PutA47 is shown to purify as an apparent dimer, to exhibit in vivo transcriptional activity, and to bind specifically to the put control DNA. In gel-mobility shift assays, PutA47 was observed to bind cooperatively to the put control DNA with an overall dissociation constant of 15 nm for the PutA47-DNA complex. Thus, N-terminal residues 1-47 are critical for DNA-binding and the dimeric structure of PutA. These results are consistent with the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1984108021,"Wilms tumors are a heterogeneous class of tumors in which Wilms tumor suppressor-1 (WT1) and the p53 tumor suppressor may be variously inactivated by mutation, reduced in expression, or even overexpressed in the wild-type state. The downstream transcriptional targets of WT1 and p53 that are critical for mediating their roles in Wilms tumorigenesis are not well defined. The WiT49 cell line is characteristic of anaplastic Wilms tumors that are refractory to treatment and expresses wild-type WT1 and mutant p53. We have used the small molecule compound CP-31398 (Pfizer) to restore wild-type p53 function to the codon 248 mutant p53 present in WiT49 cells. In these cells, CP-31398 activated transcription of p53-regulated promoters and enhanced UV light-induced apoptosis without altering the overall p53 protein level. These phenotypes were accompanied by restored binding of the p53 protein to promoter sequences in vivo. Gene expression profiling of CP-31398-treated WiT49 cells revealed subsets of putative p53 target genes that were up- or down-regulated. A preferred target of p53-mediated repression in this system is the podocalyxin (PODXL) gene. PODXL is also transcriptionally regulated by WT1 and has roles in cell adhesion and anti-adhesion. Our results show that PODXL is a bona fide target of p53-mediated transcriptional repression while being positively regulated by WT1. We propose that inappropriate expression of PODXL due to changes in WT1 and/or p53 activity may contribute to Wilms tumorigenesis.

Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, the majority of Wilms tumor cases cannot be explained by genetic alteration of the WT1 locus. There may be disruption of biological pathways either upstream or downstream of WT1, or there may be pathways independent of WT1 leading to this type of neoplasm. Several lines of evidence suggest that p53 also plays an important role in the development and/or progression of Wilms tumors. The p53 and WT1 tumor suppressor genes encode transcription factors that have been shown to interact physically and to modulate each other's function in some experimental situations (2Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). p53 can alter the transcription regulatory activity of WT1. In addition, WT1 stabilizes the p53 protein, alters its activity as a transcription factor, and prevents p53-induced apoptosis (2Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Physical and functional interaction has also been observed between the p53 family members p73 and p63 and WT1 (4Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10202-10211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further evidence for biologically relevant interaction between WT1 and p53 includes the fact that the majority of Wilms tumors develop in the presence of wild-type p53 (5Waber P.G. Chen J. Nisen P.D. Cancer. 1993; 72: 3732-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to adult onset human tumors, in which p53 mutations are frequently observed (∼50%). The small subset of Wilms tumors that do harbor p53 mutations develop into much more aggressive anaplastic tumors (between 3 and 7% of the total) that are characterized by unfavorable histology, increased metastasis, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis (6Bardeesy N.

Moreover, Li-Fraumeni patients carrying germ-line p53 mutations are predisposed to development of Wilms tumors (10Hartley A.L. Birch J.M. Tricker K. Wallace S.A. Kelsey A.M. Harris M. Jones P.H. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1993; 67: 133-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and Wilms tumors are one of a small number of cancers that are specifically associated with such mutations (11Birch J.M. Alston R.D. McNally R.J. Evans D.G. Kelsey A.M. Harris M. Eden O.B. Varley J.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4621-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To better understand the involvement of both p53 and WT1 in pathways leading to Wilms tumorigenesis, we have used cDNA microarrays to profile gene expression changes dependent upon the activity of these two factors. To accomplish this, we developed strategies to alter the function of WT1 and p53 in a Wilms tumor cell line, WiT49. This cell line is characteristic of anaplastic Wilms tumors in that it expresses wild-type WT1 and mutant p53. We have previously shown that WT1 activity can be effectively abrogated in WiT49 cells by expression of a naturally occurring dominant-negative mutant version of the protein (DDS5) (12Stanhope-Baker P. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38139-38150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To restore wild-type p53 function in WiT49 cells, we made use of the small molecule compound CP-31398 developed by Pfizer. CP-31398 was originally shown to stabilize the p53 protein with mutation at codon 173, 175, 249, or 273 in the wild-type conformation and to allow its transcriptional and tumor suppressor functions (13Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that CP-31398 can stabilize the wild-type p53 protein as well (14Takimoto R. Wang W. Dicker D.T. Rastinejad F. Lyssikatos J. el-Deiry W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Wang W. Takimoto R. Rastinejad F. El-Deiry W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Luu Y. Bush J. Cheung Jr., K.J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We found here that CP-31398 restores activity to the codon 248 mutant p53 present in WiT49 cells without altering p53 protein levels. Furthermore, our data provide a direct demonstration that CP-31398 acts, at least in part, by restoring the DNA binding capability of mutant p53 molecules. Together, the use of DDS5 and CP-31398 make it possible to manipulate the activity of two critical tumor suppressors in a setting that physiologically resembles Wilms tumor and to identify resulting changes in downstream target gene expression. To identify transcripts modulated by WT1 and/or p53 activity, we prepared a cDNA microarray containing probes for ∼1446 putative p53 target genes identified in the literature and in preliminary microarray experiments. We postulated that this group of genes would be likely to include many of the genes of interest in terms of regulation of cell growth and tumorigenesis. Hybridization of fluorescently labeled RNA from WiT49 cells grown in the presence or absence of CP-31398 allowed us to identify genes that are regulated by p53 in this system. A small subset of putative p53 target genes was robustly and reproducibly affected by CP-31398 treatment. A notable target for p53-mediated repression in this system is podocalyxin (PODXL), a cell-surface molecule involved in cell adhesion that is also transcriptionally regulated by WT1 (17Yaoita E. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Ohshiro K. Yamamoto T. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Wang W. Lee S.B. Palmer R. Ellisen L.W. Haber D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16810-16816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that PODXL expression is regulated by both p53 and WT1 and suggest that PODXL may be an important downstream mediator of p53 and WT1 activity in Wilms tumorigenesis. Cell Culture, Drug Treatments, and Transfection—The WiT49 cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CP-31398 was provided as a gift from Pfizer. The compound was dissolved in 100% Me2SO and stored in the dark at 4 °C. HCT116-p53+/+ and HCT116-p53-/- cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and treated with doxorubicin at 200 ng/ml. The stably transfected N1 and D5 cell lines were derived from WiT49 cells as described (12Stanhope-Baker P. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol.

The indicated amount of CP-31398, an equivalent volume of Me2SO solvent, or doxorubicin (200 ng/ml) was added 24 h post-transfection, and cells were harvested 19 h later. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual Luciferase activity kit (Promega). Normalization of firefly luciferase activity to either Renilla luciferase activity or total protein concentration (Bradford assay using Bio-Rad reagent) gave similar results. Semiquantitative and Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)PCRs—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by DNase treatment (DNA-free, Ambion Inc.). RNA was quantitated by spectrometry, and equal amounts were reverse-transcribed to first-strand cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and random primers. Conventional PCR was performed for detection of p21 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs using a limited number of cycles (n = 27). 2Primer sequences are available upon request. For absolute quantitation, primers and fluorescently labeled beacon probes for PODXL and GAPDH were designed and manufactured by Gorilla Genomics. Assays were performed on an ABI 7700 thermal cycler exactly as recommended by Gorilla Genomics, except that reaction volumes were reduced to 15 μl. Duplicate reactions were performed for each sample, and the average threshold cycle (Ct) at which product began to accumulate was used to determine the starting mRNA target copy number: copy number = e(Ct-b)/m, where m and b are the slope and y intercept, respectively, of a standard curve run in parallel. The standard curve was derived from reactions containing known input amounts of a double-stranded DNA target synthesized by Gorilla Genomics. Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts for p53 protein analysis (see Fig. 1C) were prepared using lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. For PARP protein analysis (see Fig. 2A), cells were exposed to UV light for 20 s and/or grown for 18 h in the presence of 15 μg/ml CP-31398, Me2SO solvent, or 0.5 μm staurosporine. Adherent cells and those that had detached from the plates were collected and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay and Bio-Rad reagent, and equal masses of protein were loaded onto each lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following separation, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.), blocked in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and probed with the appropriate primary antibody followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection of antibody-bound protein was carried out with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions: mouse anti-human PARP antibody F-2, 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-human p53 antibody DO1, 1:10,000 (sc-126, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-human β-actin antibody, 1:10,000 (Sigma); and horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody, 1:4000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences).Fig. 2CP-31398 treatment sensitizes WiT49 cells to apoptosis.A, WiT49 cells were exposed to UV light for 20 s and then grown for 18 h in the presence of 15 μg/ml CP-1398 (CP), Me2SO solvent, or 0.5 μm staurosporine (STP) as indicated above each lane. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and equivalent amounts of protein were separated in each lane by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P filter. The filter was probed with mouse anti-human PARP antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The positions of full-length and caspase-cleaved PARP proteins detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) are indicated by arrows. Extracts run in lanes 5, 6, and 8 (*) were prepared from cells floating in the supernatant of the culture following treatment. All other extracts were prepared from cells that remained adherent. B, WiT49 cells were treated with Me2SO solvent alone (C), 10 min of UV light alone (UV), 15 μg/ml CP-31398 alone (CP), or a combination of 10 min of UV light followed by CP-31398 (UV+CP). Cells were grown for 19 h after treatment and fixed for TUNEL staining of broken DNA ends. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells detected by FACScan analysis for each condition is plotted.

Microarray Hybridization—Our custom-designed/p53 target“ cDNA microarray contains probes for ∼1446 putative p53 target genes that were identified through literature searches or in preliminary unpublished profiling experiments. Probe sequences were amplified from clones purchased from Research Genetics as part of a set of 40,000 sequence-verified human clones. The quality of each probe was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. An SDDC-2 DNA Microarrayer robot (Virtek Vision Inc.) was used to spot purified probes in 1.5× SSC onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. Following printing, the slides were UV light-cross-linked (120 mJ); chemically blocked for 10 min at room temperature in 170 mm succinic anhydride and 70 mm sodium borate in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone; denatured for 2 min in 95° distilled H2O; and spun dry. The final array contained >5100 spots, including each probe in duplicate with multiple probes for some genes. In addition to putative p53 target genes, a large number of rRNA and other housekeeping genes were included for quality control and normalization purposes. 80-100 μg of total RNA prepared from cell lines using TRIzol was directly labeled by cDNA synthesis incorporating Cy3- or Cy5-linked dUTP as described (20Frevel M.A. Bakheet T. Silva A.M. Hissong J.G. Khabar K.S. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Preparation and labeling of RNA from primary Wilms tumor and normal kidney tissue samples involved one round of RNA amplification followed by an indirect aminoallyl labeling procedure. 3W. Li and B. R. G. Williams, submitted for publication. Competitive hybridization of two different RNA populations labeled with fluorescent dyes having different excitation wavelengths (Cy3, 532 nm; and Cy5, 632 nm) was as described (20Frevel M.A. Bakheet T. Silva A.M. Hissong J.G. Khabar K.S. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For identification of p53 targets in WiT49 cells, RNA from CP-31398-treated cells was hybridized against RNA from Me2SO-treated cells. For analysis of gene expression in primary tissues, each patient sample was hybridized against a common control consisting of pooled normal fetal kidney. Hybridization signals were detected and quantitated using an integrated microscanner and the GenePix analysis software package from Axon Instruments, Inc. Comparative analysis of gene expression levels was performed using GeneSpring Version 4.2 software from Silicon Genetics. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out as described (21Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA-binding proteins were cross-linked to DNA in their native setting by addition of formaldehyde to the medium of growing cells. The cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to an average length of ∼600 bp and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p53, anti-WT1, and control antibodies. For Fig. 1D, chromatin was prepared from WiT49 cells that were grown in the presence of 15 μg/ml CP-31398 or an equivalent volume of Me2SO solvent for 16 h. Chromatin was quantitated by spectrometry, and 100 μg of chromatin was used in each ChIP reaction. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody (either anti-hemagglutinin antibody as a nonspecific control (sc-805) or anti-p53 antibody (sc-6243; both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). “Total input” chromatin samples consisted of 20% of the supernatant recovered from immunoprecipitation reactions containing no antibody. For Fig. 6B, each ChIP reaction contained input chromatin equivalent to ∼107 genomes from untreated WiT49 cells. 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody was used for anti-WT1 (equal mixture of the N terminal (sc-846) and the C terminus (sc-192)), anti-p38 (sc-535), and anti-MEK3 (sc-960; all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoprecipitation. 2 μg of monoclonal antibody DO1 followed by sheep anti-mouse Ig was used for anti-p53 immunoprecipitation. Two sequential rounds of immunoprecipitation were performed in this experiment. For both experiments, antibody-bound protein-DNA complexes were collected using protein A-Agarose (16-157C, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and washed extensively. The immunoprecipitated material was purified and assayed by PCR for the enrichment of particular DNA sequences. 10% of the recovered ChIP product was used as the template for PCRs (30-35 cycles) with p21 or PODXL promoter primers. 2Primer sequences are available upon request. Products were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Restoration of p53 Activity in Wilms Tumor Cells—The small molecule compound CP-31398 restores wild-type activity to the codon 248 mutant p53 expressed in WiT49 cells as illustrated by both activation of a p53-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 1A) and endogenous p21 expression (Fig. 1B). Transcription was activated in a dose-dependent manner in both experiments and presumably resulted from restoration of the proper conformation of the p53 DNA-binding domain rather than from an increase in total p53 levels. This mode of action for the compound was suggested by Foster et al. (13Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) when it was originally discovered. More recently, several groups of investigators have suggested that CP-31398 restores p53 activity, at least in part, by increasing p53 protein levels (14Takimoto R. Wang W. Dicker D.T. Rastinejad F. Lyssikatos J. el-Deiry W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Wang W. Takimoto R. Rastinejad F. El-Deiry W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Luu Y. Bush J. Cheung Jr., K.J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Notably, we observed no change in the total amount of p53 present in WiT49 cells following exposure to CP-31398 (Fig. 1C). To directly address the mechanism by which CP-31398 restores p53 transcriptional function in WiT49 cells, we performed ChIP assays with anti-p53 antibodies on chromatin isolated from control or CP-31398-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, p53 occupancy of a defined p53-binding site within the p21 promoter (22Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) was observed only in WiT49 cells that were treated with CP-31398. This confirms that the codon 248 mutant p53 present in WiT49 cells is defective in DNA binding. Furthermore, the observed induction of p21 transcription by CP-31398 was accompanied by restoration of p53 binding to the p21 promoter in vivo. Thus, these results provide direct in vivo confirmation of the mode of action originally proposed for CP-31398 (13Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In addition to activating p53-dependent transcription, CP-31398 treatment resulted in sensitization of WiT49 cells to UV light-induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis of PARP cleavage indicated that the ability of WiT49 cells to undergo apoptosis in response to UV irradiation was enhanced by coincident treatment with CP-31398, presumably through its restoration of p53 function (Fig. 2A). In this experiment, staurosporine treatment provided a positive control for PARP cleavage. Staurosporine interferes with both protein kinase C and members of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase machinery to abrogate the G2 checkpoint and to induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner (23Senderowicz A.M. Oncologist. 2002; 7: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of mutant p53-expressing WiT49 cells with staurosporine alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis as indicated by detachment of a fraction of the cells from the plate and PARP cleavage in both adherent and detached cells. In contrast, untreated WiT49 cells, as well as those treated with either UV irradiation or CP-31398 alone, did not contain significant amounts of cleaved PARP protein. However, increased PARP cleavage was apparent in cells that received DNA damage stress via UV light in the presence of CP-31398. TUNEL staining of broken DNA ends followed by FACScan analysis also showed that CP-31398 treatment promoted UV light-induced apoptosis in WiT49 cells in a synergistic manner (Fig. 2B). These results provide further indication that CP-31398 effectively restores wild-type p53 function in the WiT49 cell line. In addition, we observed that CP-31398 treatment led to activation of the AKT kinase (protein kinase B) as indicated by Ser473 phosphorylation (data not shown). Activation of AKT is indicative of survival pathways being induced (24Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This may explain the lack of significant cell death in WiT49 cells treated with CP-31398 alone under the conditions used for these experiments. Identification of p53-regulated Target Genes in Wilms Tumor Cells—To identify genes that are regulated at the transcriptional level by p53 in WiT49 cells, we generated gene expression profiles for cells treated with CP-31398 in comparison with cells treated with Me2SO, the solvent for the compound. Total RNA was prepared from WiT49 cells grown for 19 h in the presence of 15 μg/ml CP-31398. Drug-treated and control RNAs were labeled and competitively hybridized against the p53 target microarray in five independent experiments. The vast majority of the ∼1446 unique genes in the array did not show any change in expression level upon drug treatment when the five experiments were averaged (Fig. 3). This indicates that CP-31398 does not alter gene expression in a nonspecific manner. However, subsets of genes were significantly up- or down-regulated (Tables I and II, respectively). Genes were classified as “p53-regulated” in this system if they showed an average change in expression between control and CP-31398-treated cells of >2.5-fold over the five experiments. As illustrated in Tables I and II, most of the p53-regulated genes we identified showed changes of 2.5-fold or more in the majority (if not all) of the experiments. The incorporation of data from five independent experiments makes this a stringent selection. Thus, there may be some important p53-regulated target genes missing from our lists. However, those that are listed are done so with a high degree of confidence.Table IGene induction following CP-31398 treatmentView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table IIGene repression following CP-31398 treatmentView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the genes that were most significantly up- or down-regulated by CP-31398 treatment of WiT49 cells are not the most well known “classical” p53 target genes and, in many cases, have not been previously reported. Moreover, CP-31398-induced gene expression changes in the WiT49 cell line do not correlate strongly with those reported for two colon cancer cell lines (14Takimoto R. Wang W. Dicker D.T. Rastinejad F. Lyssikatos J. el-Deiry W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As has been shown for physiologically activated p53, it is likely that CP-31398-restored p53 displays cell-type specificity in the spectrum of genes that it transactivates or represses. The WT1 Target Gene Podocalyxin Is Negatively Regulated by p53—Of the genes that were significantly and reproducibly repressed by CP-31398 treatment in WiT49 cells, PODXL was particularly interesting to us since it has previously been shown to be a transcriptional target"
https://openalex.org/W1983433502,"The high local concentration of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction results from their aggregation by the agrin/MuSK signaling pathway and their synthetic up-regulation by the neuregulin/ErbB pathway. Here, we show a novel role for the neuregulin/ErbB pathway, the inhibition of AChR aggregation on the muscle surface. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with the neuregulin epidermal growth factor domain decreased the number of both spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR clusters, in part by increasing the rate of cluster disassembly. Upon cluster disassembly, AChRs were internalized into caveolae (as identified by caveolin-3). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that individual AChR clusters fragmented into puncta, and application of neuregulin accelerated the rate at which AChR clusters decreased in area without affecting the density of AChRs remaining in individual clusters (as measured by the fluorescence intensity/unit area). We propose that this novel action of neuregulin regulates synaptic competition at the developing neuromuscular junction.

We propose that this novel action of neuregulin regulates synaptic competition at the developing neuromuscular junction. The mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ) 1The abbreviations used are: NMJ, neuromuscular junction; AChR, acetylcholine receptor; MuSK, muscle-specific kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; α-Btx, α-bungarotoxin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a cholinergic synapse composed of a muscle fiber, an axon terminal (located in a depression on the muscle surface known as the primary gutter), and a terminal Schwann cell. Within the postsynaptic membrane of the primary gutter, AChRs are concentrated at 10,000/μm2 (1Salpeter M.M. Marchaterre M. Harris R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2087-2093Google Scholar). This density is 1000-fold higher than in extrajunctional regions of muscle. Two protein signaling pathways contribute to the enrichment of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the NMJ. The first involves the release of agrin from the axon terminal, which binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK on the muscle surface, and ultimately results in clustering of AChRs at the NMJ (reviewed in Ref. 2Willmann R. Fuhrer C. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1296-1316Google Scholar). The second pathway involves neuregulin, which is released from the axon terminal and activates ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases on the muscle surface, resulting in the up-regulation of AChR mRNA synthesis by subsynaptic myonuclei (reviewed in Refs. 3Buonanno A. Fischbach G.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 287-296Google Scholar and 4Schaeffer L. d'Exaerde A.D. Changeux J.P. Neuron. 2001; 31: 15-22Google Scholar). Alternative splicing results in at least 14 variants of the neuregulin-1 gene (hereafter referred to as neuregulin), which have been grouped into three major protein isoforms (types I–III). An extracellular epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain is common to all variants and is sufficient to activate ErbB receptors (5Yang J.F. Ng Y.P. Pun S. Ip N.Y. Tsim K.W.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 163-167Google Scholar). The variants can be distinguished in part by the presence of either an amino-terminal Ig-like domain or a cysteine-rich domain. Different splice variants are expressed in many organs, including motor neurons and skeletal muscle (6Meyer D. Yamaai T. Garratt A. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Kane D. Theill L.E. Birchmeier C. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3575-3586Google Scholar). Most isoforms also contain a transmembrane domain and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. Upon cleavage of the transmembrane domain, neuregulin is incorporated into the extracellular matrix (7Goodearl A.D.J. Yee A.G. Sandrock Jr., A.W. Corfas G. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1423-1434Google Scholar, 8Loeb J.A. Susanto E.T. Fischbach G.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Google Scholar). During the early postnatal period in mammalian muscle, synaptic competition occurs between the multiple axons that initially innervate individual muscle fibers, with most muscle fibers become singly innervated by the second postnatal week (9Redfern P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1970; 209: 701-709Google Scholar). Synaptic competition likely involves a factor that destabilizes the nascent postsynaptic complex at soon to be eliminated synapses. Before the losing nerve terminal retracts from the muscle surface, the densities of AChR, utrophin, and rapsyn all decline immediately beneath the terminal (10Rich M. Lichtman J.W. Neuron. 1989; 3: 677-688Google Scholar, 11Balice-Gordon R.J. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 834-855Google Scholar, 12Culican S.M. Nelson C.C. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4953-4965Google Scholar). This destabilizing factor is either directly released from competing nerve terminals or generated in the muscle in response to activity at the competing terminal. TrkB receptors are found postsynaptically at the NMJ. In myotube cultures, neurotrophin activation of TrkB receptors leads to inhibition of agrin-induced AChR clustering (13Wells D.G. McKechnie B.A. Kelkar S. Fallon J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1112-1117Google Scholar). However, inhibition of TrkB signaling both in myotube culture and in vivo has also been shown to disrupt AChR clustering (14Gonzalez M. Ruggiero F.P. Chang Q. Shi Y.-J. Rich M.M. Kraner S. Balice-Gordon R.J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 567-583Google Scholar); and therefore, the role of neurotrophin signaling in agrin-induced AChR clustering remains uncertain. The receptor tyrosine kinases MuSK and TrkB are both able to regulate AChR aggregation. We therefore examined the ability of ErbB receptors to modulate AChR distribution in C2C12 myotubes. The mouse muscle cell line C2 and its subclone C2C12 have been used extensively to characterize AChR clustering on the surface of muscle cells (15Weston C. Gordon C. Teressa G. Hod E. Ren X.D. Prives J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6450-6455Google Scholar, 16Moransard M. Borges L.S. Willmann R. Marangi P.A. Brenner H.R. Ferns M.J. Fuhrer C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44868-44873Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the EGF domain of neuregulin-β1 is able to inhibit both spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR aggregation. This inhibition results in part from a decreased stability of individual AChR clusters. Reagents—The mouse muscle cell line C2C12 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Assistent brand coverslips (12 and 22 mm, No. 1) were obtained from Carolina Biological Supply Co. (Burlington, NC). Alexa 594-α-bungarotoxin (α-Btx), Alexa 488-α-Btx, biotin-α-Btx, Alexa 594-streptavidin, Alexa 488-streptavidin, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, and Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Rat tail collagen was obtained from BD Biosciences. All other tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Recombinant rat neural agrin (amino acids 1153–1948, including the three laminin G-like domains) and neuregulin (the EGF domain of human neuregulin-β1, amino acids 176–246) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Mouse monoclonal antibody against utrophin (DRP1) was obtained from NovoCastra Laboratories (Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) and used at a 1:10 dilution of hybridoma supernatant. Mouse monoclonal antibody against caveolin-3 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Mouse monoclonal antibody against the β-hinge region of the clathrin adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2 was a gift from Dr. Tomas Kirchhausen (Harvard Medical School) (19Tong X. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 476-482Google Scholar), and affinity-purified rabbit anti-Btx antibody was a gift from Dr. Robert Sealock (University of North Carolina). Cell Culture—Coverslips were coated with a 75 μg/ml solution of collagen in 2% acetic acid, which was evaporated to dryness. The coverslips were then rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). C2C12 cells were grown as myoblasts in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. To produce myotubes, the myoblasts were initially grown to confluence on 10-cm tissue culture plates (Corning 430293). High glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum was added for 48 h and then replaced daily. Upon evidence of fusion (2–3 days after addition of 2% horse serum), the cells were trypsinized with 10 μg/ml DNase (Worthington). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min, spun down, and replated at 50% confluence onto coverslips. Half of the medium was replaced daily. Myotubes were typically used 2–4 days following replating. Assaying the Effect of Neuregulin on AChR Cluster Number—To assess the effect of neuregulin on the number of spontaneous AChR clusters, myotubes were treated for 12 h with 2 nm neuregulin, and the number of AChR clusters was then compared with that in untreated myotubes. To assess the effect of neuregulin on agrin-induced AChR clustering, myotubes were treated for 12 h with 100 pm agrin in the presence or absence of 2 nm neuregulin. To assess the ability of neuregulin to promote cluster disassembly, myotubes were treated for 12 h with 100 pm agrin, and then the agrin was removed and replaced with either fresh differentiation medium or medium containing 2 nm neuregulin. The cells were incubated for 23 h. At the end of the pharmacological treatments, the myotubes were incubated for 30 min with 80 nm Alexa 594-α-Btx or Alexa 488-α-Btx. The cells were washed and then fixed for 10 min with a 2% formaldehyde/PBS solution (from paraformaldehyde). A 5% solution of N-propyl gallate in 90% glycerol was added, and the coverslips were mounted on slides and sealed with nail polish. At the start of each experiment, the coverslips were coded to identify their specific treatment. The clusters in a visual field under each condition were then counted in a blind fashion using a ×60 lens (1.4 numerical aperture). A cluster was defined as a patch of AChRs >4 μm in length. In general, 15 fields/coverslip and three to four coverslips for each condition were counted. Each neuregulin assay experiment was conducted at least three times, with similar results. Biotin-α-Btx Internalization Assay—C2C12 myotubes were either treated for 12 h with 100 pm agrin or left untreated. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 120 nm biotin-α-Btx. The cells were washed with PBS to remove the excess biotin-α-Btx, and fresh medium was added. The myotubes were incubated for 7 h at 37 °C to allow for internalization of AChRs. At the end of this incubation period, the cells were placed on ice, and 22 nm Alexa 594-streptavidin or Alexa 488-streptavidin in medium was added for 30 min to completely label any biotin-α-Btx remaining on the cell surface. Keeping the cells on ice prevented AChR internalization due to streptavidin-induced cross-linking of the AChRs. The cells were then washed; fixed for 10 min with a 2% formaldehyde/PBS solution; and permeabilized with blocking solution containing 10% normal goat serum, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with the Alexa-streptavidin (22 nm) not used initially. The second Alexa-streptavidin step labeled biotin-α-Btx bound to AChRs that were inaccessible in the absence of membrane permeabilization. The cells were incubated in this solution either for 1 h at room temperature or for 12 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS three times for 5 min and then mounted on coverslips. Light Microscopy—Epifluorescent images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse E800 equipped with a Nikon ×60 Plan Apo objective (1.40 numerical aperture). Alexa 488 fluorescence was filtered through a Nikon 91617 fluorescein isothiocyanate HYQ band-pass filter (emission at 515–560 nm). Alexa 594 fluorescence was filtered through a Nikon 96176 rhodamine HYQ band-pass filter (emission at 590–650 nm). No bleed-through of fluorescent signal was observed when only one fluorophore was used. 12-Bit images were acquired with a Micromax digital camera (Princeton Scientific Instruments Inc., Monmouth Junction, NJ) operated using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Westchester, PA). Images were converted to 8 bits for processing in Adobe Photoshop. Live Cell Imaging—C2C12 myotubes were grown on 22-mm coverslips, treated for 12 h with 150 pm agrin, and then incubated for 30 min with 40 nm Alexa 594-α-Btx. Each coverslip was mounted in a viewing chamber; fresh medium was added (lacking phenol red); and a gas line containing 10% CO2 in air was attached. In some experiments, 5 nm neuregulin was added along with the fresh medium. The chamber was placed into a 37 °C heating block fitted onto the stage of an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 equipped with a Nikon ×60 Plan Apo objective (1.40 numerical aperture). Alexa 594 fluorescence was monitored via Cy3 excitation and emission filters and a polychroic beam splitter (86000 filter set, Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). The XYZ stage was from Prior Scientific (Rockland, MA), and the filter wheel and shutter were controlled using a Lambda 10-2 controller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Images were acquired with a Micromax digital camera, and Metamorph software was used for computer control of the stage, shutter, and camera. Individual clusters were located by visualization through the eyepiece, and their locations were entered into the stage control of the software. Generally four to eight clusters were imaged per experiment. Images were acquired for 600 ms using a neutral density filter that reduced the excitation intensity by 75%. Images were typically acquired every 30 min. Quantitation of AChR Cluster Disassembly—Image analysis and quantitation were performed using Metamorph and Microsoft Excel. For each time series, an AChR cluster was defined as those pixels whose brightness exceeded an intensity threshold that was set to include the pixels that extended to the apparent perimeter of the cluster. Each image in a time series had the same threshold. The area of the cluster (total pixels above the threshold) and the total fluorescence intensity of the cluster (sum of the intensities of the pixels above the threshold) were measured at each time point. The fluorescence intensity/unit area was determined by dividing the cluster total fluorescence by the cluster area. AChR Responses to Agrin—We examined the distribution of AChRs in C2C12 myotubes in the absence and presence of recombinant agrin to confirm that agrin induces aggregation of AChRs in our system. In the absence of agrin, there were infrequent AChR clusters (which were defined as aggregation of AChRs with a length of at least 4 μm). Treatment for 12 h with 100 pm agrin lead to the robust formation of AChR clusters (Fig. 1, A2 and B2). When measured in terms of AChR clusters/field, agrin increased the number of clusters by 5–10-fold, with a half-maximal response at an agrin concentration of ∼40 pm (Fig. 1C), in agreement with previously reported values (20Godfrey E.W. Nitkin R.M. Wallace B.G. Rubin L.L. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 615-627Google Scholar). For myotubes treated with a saturating level of agrin, the maximal number of AChR clusters/field ranged between 25 and 50 from experiment to experiment. As an additional confirmation that our C2C12 myotubes were responding to agrin in a similar fashion to that observed in other laboratories, we examined the distribution of utrophin at agrin-induced AChR clusters. In addition to co-localizing with the AChR in the primary gutter at the NMJ, utrophin has been shown to co-localize with AChR at agrin-induced clusters (21Phillips W.D. Noakes P.G. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 729-740Google Scholar, 22Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 663-674Google Scholar). We confirmed that utrophin was enriched at agrin-induced AChR clusters (Fig. 1A1). Due to the role of caveolae in organizing receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (for a review, see Ref. 23Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Google Scholar) and the importance of tyrosine kinase activity in AChR clustering (24Mohamed A.S. Rivas-Plata K.A. Kraas J.R. Saleh S.M. Swope S.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3806-3818Google Scholar, 25Mittaud P. Marangi P.A. Erb-Vögtli S. Fuhrer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14505-14513Google Scholar), we examined the distribution of caveolin-3 compared with agrin-induced AChR clusters (Fig. 1B). After a 12-h treatment with agrin, there were numerous AChR clusters, but caveolin-3 was not enriched with them. Although there was caveolin-3 staining near AChR clusters, the pattern of caveolin-3 immunofluorescence did not correlate with the distribution of AChRs. Neuregulin Inhibition of AChR Clustering—We examined the distribution of AChRs on the surface of C2C12 myotubes after treatment with neuregulin in the absence and presence of agrin. In the absence of agrin, myotubes treated for 12 h with 2 nm neuregulin displayed ∼75% fewer AChR clusters compared with untreated myotubes (Fig. 2A). The IC50 for the reduction of spontaneous AChR clusters by neuregulin was ≈100 pm (Fig. 2B). This concentration dependence was similar to that seen for the equilibrium binding of the neuregulin EGF domain to ErbB2 receptors (Kd ≈ 105 pm) in breast tumor cells (26Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Google Scholar) and for the induction of expression of AChR subunit reporter genes (EC50 ≈200–300 pm) in mouse primary myotubes (27Chu G.C. Moscoso L.M. Sliwkowski M.X. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 329-339Google Scholar) and in C2C12 myotubes (28Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Google Scholar). To determine whether neuregulin also affects the agrin-induced formation of AChR clusters, myotubes were incubated for 12 h with 80 pm agrin with or without 2 nm neuregulin. Under these conditions, there were 60% fewer clusters in the neuregulin-treated myotubes (Fig. 2C). In addition, myotubes were incubated for 12 h with 100 pm agrin; the agrin was then removed; and the cells were incubated for 23 h in medium with or without 2 nm neuregulin. In these cultures, the myotubes treated with neuregulin contained 85% fewer AChR clusters (Fig. 2D). Visualization of Surface and Internalized AChRs—To qualitatively characterize AChR redistribution during cluster formation, maintenance, and disassembly, we examined the subcellular distribution of AChRs during these processes. We used a protocol to differentiate between AChRs at the surface and those that had been recently internalized. This protocol involved labeling AChRs on the surface of live myotubes with biotin-α-Btx. The myotubes were then incubated for 7 h, during which a portion of the AChRs underwent internalization. During these 7 h, the myotubes were either left untreated or treated with agrin or neuregulin. At the end of the 7-h incubation, the biotin-α-Btx-labeled AChRs remaining on the surface were labeled with a fluorescent streptavidin for 30 min at 4 °C; the cells were permeabilized; and the internalized biotin-α-Btx-labeled AChRs were detected with a different fluorescent streptavidin. AChR Internalization during Cluster Formation—We initially examined AChR redistribution in response to agrin treatment. AChRs were labeled with biotin-α-Btx, and then the myotubes were treated with 100 pm agrin for 7 h. Following the sequential streptavidin staining protocol, 90–95% of AChR clusters were stained only by the initial application of fluorescent streptavidin (Fig. 3A). The failure of the second application of streptavidin to further label these clusters served as a control demonstrating saturated binding of the surface biotin-α-Btx by the first application of streptavidin. Since the initial application of streptavidin completely bound all surface-accessible biotin-α-Btx, any additional staining by the second application of streptavidin corresponded to internalized biotin-α-Btx, which was not accessible prior to permeabilization of the membrane. At ∼5–10% of AChR clusters, such internalized biotin-α-Btx-labeled AChRs were stained by the second streptavidin (Fig. 3B). This internal staining of AChRs was punctate in nature and distinct from that of the surface AChRs (as visualized by the initial streptavidin application). AChR Internalization during Cluster Maintenance and Disassembly—Since agrin is known to reduce the turnover rate of AChRs (29Bezakova G. Rabben I. Sefland I. Fumagalli G. Lomo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9924-9929Google Scholar), it was surprising to observe endocytosed AChRs associated with AChR clusters following agrin treatment. To determine whether AChRs become internalized from AChR clusters after cluster formation, myotubes were treated for 12 h with 100 pm agrin, labeled for 30 min with biotin-α-Btx, and then incubated for an additional 7 h in the continued presence of 100 pm agrin. During the second incubation phase, new AChR cluster formation should be greatly reduced since the total number of AChR clusters does not continue to increase with longer exposure to agrin (30Wallace B.G. Qu Z. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Google Scholar). If agrin-induced clusters are stable in the continued presence of agrin, then there should be a decrease in internalization near AChR clusters. However, under these experimental conditions, we still observed punctate internalized AChR staining at ∼5–10% of AChR clusters. The punctate aggregates of internalized AChRs were most often seen associated with surface AChR clusters (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that even in the continued presence of agrin, individual AChR clusters are dynamic structures, with some of their AChRs undergoing internalization. However, there were spontaneous AChR clusters on the myotube surface in the absence of agrin, with agrin increasing the number of clusters by 5–10-fold (Figs. 1C and 2). Our experiments did not determine whether the punctate aggregates of internalized AChRs seen in the presence of agrin are associated with a small fraction of the agrin-induced clusters or preferentially with the small number of spontaneously formed AChR clusters that may also persist after treatment with agrin. We also examined the internalization of AChRs during AChR cluster disassembly following the removal of agrin. The internalization protocol was repeated using myotubes that were treated for 12 h with agrin, labeled with biotin-α-Btx, and then incubated for 7 h in medium lacking agrin. As a population, agrin-induced AChR clusters are known to disassemble upon agrin removal with a half-life of between 6 and 12 h (31Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 267-278Google Scholar). In a similar fashion to the previous experiments, punctate aggregated internalized AChRs were found near 5–10% of surface clusters (Fig. 3D). We cannot be sure that the clusters we observed with internalized AChR staining (such as in Fig. 3D) were actually undergoing disassembly. However, under the conditions of this assay, the majority of clusters were undergoing disassembly. Endocytosis of AChRs into Caveolae—To characterize the cellular compartment containing the internalized AChRs, we compared the distribution of surface and internalized AChRs with that of caveolae (as identified by caveolin-3) and clathrin-coated pits (as identified by the clathrin-associated adaptor protein AP-2). Internalized AChRs were co-localized with caveolin-3 (Fig. 4A1–3), whereas there was no co-localization between internalized AChRs and AP-2 (Fig. 4B1–3). Effect of Neuregulin on AChR Internalization: Live Cell Imaging of Cultured Myotubes—The results of the population studies revealed that neuregulin clearly reduced the number of spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR clusters. When we examined AChR internalization during AChR cluster formation and disassembly in the presence of neuregulin, internalized AChRs were seen distributed in a punctate pattern and associated with surface AChR clusters (data not shown). However, the studies provided no insights into the mechanism by which this occurred, and the assay was not well suited for a quantitative comparison of the differences in AChR internalization under different experimental conditions. To better characterize the effects of neuregulin on clustered AChRs, we examined AChR cluster disassembly in living myotubes in the presence and absence of neuregulin. Characterization of AChR Cluster Disassembly—We visualized agrin-induced AChR clusters for 8 h following the removal of agrin. Myotubes were grown on coverslips and treated for 12 h with 100 pm agrin. The AChRs were then labeled with Alexa 594-α-Btx; the agrin-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium; and each coverslip was attached to a heated chamber and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. Fig. 5 shows the 0-, 2-, 5-, and 8-h time points for a typical AChR cluster imaged once every hour for 8 h. The AChR clusters displayed a range of morphologies upon removal of agrin from the medium. During the 8-h time period, 64% of the clusters (23 of 36) fragmented into small puncta, as shown in Fig. 5A. In this cluster, small puncta become evident by 2 h after the removal of agrin. The AChR clusters that underwent fragmentation did so as early as 1 h or as late as 7 h after the removal of agrin, with a median time of 5 h. The puncta were similar in shape to those seen in the internalization experiments. Whereas the latter AChR puncta were endocytosed AChRs, the puncta in the live cell imaging experiments originated from AChRs that were on the myotube surface at the beginning of the imaging period and may or may not have subsequently been endocytosed. The remaining 36% (13 of 36) of the clusters became smaller in area, but did not fragment. Qualitatively, the clusters appeared to decrease in area and total fluorescence intensity. The same protocol was used to characterize the effects of neuregulin on cluster disassembly, with 5 nm neuregulin added to the medium immediately prior to the start of imaging. A total of 28 clusters were imaged from four separate experiments. The clusters had a greater tendency to fragment into puncta (82%, 23 of 28) in the presence of neuregulin. Quantitation of AChR Cluster Disassembly—Cluster area, total fluorescence intensity, and fluorescence intensity/unit area were measured as a function of time as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An example of the threshold procedure is shown in Fig. 5 (A and A′), corresponding to a cluster at 0, 2, 5, and 8 h. The black regions in Fig. 5A′ represent the pixels in the panels in Fig. 5A above the fluorescence threshold. For myotubes not exposed to neuregulin, the average AChR cluster area decreased by 57% during the 8-h time period after the removal of agrin (Fig. 5B, open circles). Treatment with neuregulin accelerated the decrease in the area of AChR clusters. When myotubes were treated with 5 nm neuregulin, there was an 80% decrease in AChR cluster area during the 8-h time period (p < 0.002) (Fig. 5B, closed diamonds). When myotubes were not exposed to neuregulin, the total fluorescence decreased by 74% during the 8-h time period after the removal of agrin (Fig. 5C, open circles). When myotubes disassembled in the presence of 5 nm neuregulin, the total fluorescence decreased at a faster rate. At the end of 8 h, the total fluorescence had decreased by 88% (p < 0.02) (Fig. 5C, closed diamonds). Whereas neuregulin treatment led to a decrease in both the cluster area and total number of AChRs at individual clusters, there was no effect on the density of AChRs remaining in the cluster (as measured by the fluorescence/unit area). Over 8 h, the fluorescence intensity/unit area decreased by 40 and 39% in myotubes not exposed to neuregulin (Fig. 5D, open circles) and in neuregulin-treated myotubes (closed diamonds), respectively. In this study, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to characterize the effects of neuregulin, the ErbB receptor ligand, on the stability of spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR clusters. We used a recombinant neuregulin containing the EGF domain, which has been shown to activate ErbB receptors and to induce expression of AChR subunit genes in myotube cultures (5Yang J.F. Ng Y.P. Pun S. Ip N.Y. Tsim K.W.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 163-167Google Scholar, 27Chu G.C. Moscoso L.M. Sliwkowski M.X. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 329-339Google Scholar, 28Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Google Scholar). We demonstrated that this neuregulin domain had a strong inhibitory effect on the number of spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR clusters. Real-time imaging of individual AChR clusters demonstrated that neuregulin increased the rate of AChR cluster disassembly. Upon cluster disassembly, AChRs were internalized into caveolae. Neuregulin Inhibition of AChR Clustering—Neuregulin has been studied extensively for its ability to promote the synthesis of AChRs at the NMJ (reviewed in Ref. 4Schaeffer L. d'Exaerde A.D. Changeux J.P. Neuron. 2001; 31: 15-22Google Scholar). However, an additional inhibitory effect of neuregulin on AChR clustering is not inconsistent with the role of neuregulin in the formation and maintenance of the NMJ; and indeed, there are several possible developmental roles that this inhibitory effect of neuregulin may play. As measured by 125I-labeled α-Btx binding, neuregulin and the neuregulin EGF domain have been shown to increase by 2–3-fold the rate of insertion of AChRs onto the surface of cultured myotubes in the absence of agrin (32Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Google Scholar, 33Li Q.F. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Google Scholar). Our experiments show that neuregulin reduced the number of spontaneous or agrin-induced AChR clusters and increased the disassembly of AChR clusters. In non-agrin-treated myotubes, spontaneous AChR clusters were infrequent, and neuregulin might selectively increase their endocytosis while increasing total surface AChR levels due to an overall increase in receptor synthesis and insertion. Several observations led to the hypothesis that there exist factors from either the nerve or muscle that destabilize clusters of AChR. First, spontaneous AChR clusters are very scarce extrajunctionally in innervated muscle, but become more common following denervation (34Ko P.K. Anderson M.J. Cohen M.W. Science. 1977; 196: 540-542Google Scholar). Second, during synapse elimination at the developing NMJ, in the absence of synaptic takeover, the postsynaptic apparatus appears to be lost underneath the axon terminal prior to its retraction (10Rich M. Lichtman J.W. Neuron. 1989; 3: 677-688Google Scholar, 11Balice-Gordon R.J. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 834-855Google Scholar, 12Culican S.M. Nelson C.C. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4953-4965Google Scholar). AChRs remain stabilized when the vacated synaptic site is reoccupied by the remaining axon, whereas a rapid loss of AChRs occurs when synaptic sites are not reoccupied (35Walsh M.K. Lichtman J.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 67-73Google Scholar). The relative stability of the postsynaptic complex in denervated muscle is evidence for the existence of a nerve-mediated destabilizing factor (36Frank E. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 143-158Google Scholar, 37Moss B.L. Schuetze S.M. J. Neurobiol. 1987; 18: 101-118Google Scholar). However, if a denervated myofiber is re-innervated and if the original NMJ is only partially reoccupied by the axon terminal, then the unoccupied portions of the postsynaptic apparatus become disassembled (38Werle M.J. Sojka A.M. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 293-302Google Scholar, 39Astrow S.H. Pitaevski V. Herrera A.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5130-5140Google Scholar). The factor is able to destabilize AChRs in neighboring inactive regions of muscle, whereas if it is generated in active regions of muscle, it does not destabilize the AChRs there. Presumably, stabilizing factors, which act more locally, overcome the destabilizing ones. In mice that lack neuregulin expression in neurons innervating the diaphragm, AChR transcription and clustering along the central band are normal (40Yang X. Arber S. William C. Li L. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Birchmeier C. Burden S.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 399-410Google Scholar). ErbB receptor signaling appears to be maintained by muscle-derived neuregulin; and therefore, changes in AChR clustering would not necessarily be expected. Mice have been generated lacking ErbB2 expression in both muscle and nerve (41Morris J.K. Lin W.C. Hauser C. Marchuk Y. Getman D. Lee K.F. Neuron. 1999; 23: 273-283Google Scholar). Although AChR clusters exist in the central band and contain rapsyn, MuSK, and dystroglycan, they display altered morphology. An ultrastructural examination of synapses showed impaired formation of junctional folds, consistent with a role of neuregulin in synaptic structural organization (42Lin W.C. Sanchez H.B. Deerinck T. Morris J.K. Ellisman M. Lee K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1299-1304Google Scholar). However, the absence of Schwann cells at the NMJs in these mice complicates this interpretation since the lack of Schwann cells may more readily explain the impaired junctional fold formation. Neurotrophins acting through the TrkB receptors can inhibit agrin-induced AChR clustering on cultured myotubes (Ref. 13Wells D.G. McKechnie B.A. Kelkar S. Fallon J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1112-1117Google Scholar; but see Ref. 14Gonzalez M. Ruggiero F.P. Chang Q. Shi Y.-J. Rich M.M. Kraner S. Balice-Gordon R.J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 567-583Google Scholar). Neuregulin and the ErbB receptors are also well positioned to have similar effects. The ErbB and TrkB receptors both activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phospholipase C pathways, although the specific modulation of these pathways by the two receptors is likely different. In addition, ErbB receptors activate phosphatase pathways in muscle. In C2C12 myotubes, neuregulin increases the association of ErbB receptors with the phosphatase SHP2 (43Tanowitz M. Si J. Yu D.-H. Feng G.-S. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9426-9435Google Scholar); and in cultured frog myotubes, phosphatase activity regulates AChR cluster stability (44Dai Z. Peng H.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1613-1624Google Scholar). Modulation of Rho GTPase activity represents another mechanism by which ErbB signaling could regulate AChR clustering. In C2 myotubes, inhibition of Rho activity blocks the formation of agrin-induced AChR clusters and instead leads to an increase in the formation of punctate “microclusters” (15Weston C. Gordon C. Teressa G. Hod E. Ren X.D. Prives J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6450-6455Google Scholar). AChR Internalization at AChR Clusters—The biotin-α-Btx internalization assay demonstrated that endocytosis of AChRs occurred near AChR clusters during both agrin-induced cluster formation and cluster disassembly after agrin removal. Upon removal of agrin, live cell imaging revealed that the AChR clusters disassembled, and the punctate structures in the area of the AChR clusters may correspond in part to recently endocytosed AChRs. However, even after agrin removal, internalized AChRs were seen at only a small fraction of AChR clusters (<10%), and further studies are required to determine whether those internalized AChRs are associated with agrin-induced clusters or, alternatively, with the small number of spontaneous clusters that may persist after agrin treatment. AChRs became localized to caveolae upon internalization. Caveolae can serve as organizers of protein endocytosis and as integrators of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (23Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Google Scholar). Further experiments will be required to determine whether the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases signal through caveolae to direct internalization of AChRs. Dynamics of Individual Cluster Disassembly—We visualized the reorganization of agrin-induced AChR clusters upon removal of agrin. Eight hours after the removal of agrin, 25% of the original AChRs remained at the cluster. This is in general agreement with the results of Kim and Nelson (45Kim S. Nelson P.G. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 22-32Google Scholar), who determined that 38% of the original AChRs remain at clusters after 8 h in primary rat myotubes. Clusters generally disassemble via fragmentation of the cluster into smaller puncta. In contrast, time-lapse imaging of AChR clusters in cultured frog muscle cells (44Dai Z. Peng H.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1613-1624Google Scholar) revealed that when clusters disassemble, the overall morphology of the cluster remains intact, and the clusters lose AChRs uniformly, as expected if individual AChRs diffuse away from the cluster. The conflicting results are most likely attributable to underlying differences in synapse formation in frog versus mouse. In our live cell imaging experiments, neuregulin increased the rate of AChR cluster disassembly, but had no effect on the density of AChRs remaining in the cluster (as measured by the fluorescence/unit area). This would occur if neuregulin acts by disrupting a higher order organization within individual clusters. In this scenario, clusters are composed of small structural units (seen as puncta) that are held together within a cluster by a cytoskeletal network. A small number of AChR and rapsyn molecules contribute to each puncta. The clusters would become smaller in area while maintaining their AChR surface density if neuregulin disrupts the interaction between the puncta and the cluster superstructure so that puncta are lost from the cluster while leaving the AChR-rapsyn interactions intact and the fluorescence intensity/puncta unchanged. A fragmenting phenomenon similar to ours has been observed in vivo at NMJs in mice labeled with fluorescent α-Btx (46Akaaboune M. Culican S.M. Turney S.G. Lichtman J.W. Science. 1999; 286: 503-507Google Scholar). Puncta corresponding to internalized AChRs were observed in the perijunctional region within 8 h after addition of curare to block synaptic transmission. In this study, we have shown that activation of ErbB receptors by the EGF domain of neuregulin reduced the number of spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR clusters in cultured myotubes. We propose that, in addition to regulating subsynaptic AChR transcription, neuregulin also mediates synaptic competition at the developing NMJ. In the future, it will be important to establish which specific neuregulin isoforms act in vivo to modulate agrin-induced AChR clustering."
https://openalex.org/W1963595149,"Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) has been demonstrated to bind to Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, components of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, thereby inhibiting the pathway and resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation. In the present study, we examined whether PEBP is involved in differentiation induction of human keratinocytes. PEBP expression was immunohistochemically examined in normal human skin and skin cancers with different differentiation properties. PEBP was not expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis but was expressed in the spinous and granular layers of normal skin. The protein was expressed in differentiated but not in undifferentiated carcinoma. PEBP expression was also examined in cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes in which differentiation was induced by calcium treatment. Involucrin was used as a differentiation marker for spinous and granular cells. Northern blotting analysis indicated that both PEBP and involucrin mRNAs were enhanced 6 h after treatment with 2.0 mm CaCl2. The protein amount of PEBP was also increased by this treatment. To investigate whether PEBP is involved in differentiation induction of keratinocytes, HaCaT keratinocytes were transfected with an expression vector. Fluorescent immunostain revealed that cells expressing PEBP exhibited enlarged and flattened cell shape, and induction of involucrin expression was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis. Although the protein amount of ERK was not altered, phosphorylated ERK levels were decreased and cell proliferation was partly inhibited by PEBP expression.

Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) 1The abbreviations used are: PEBP, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; NHEK, normal human epidermal keratinocyte; KGM, keratinocyte growth medium; RT, reverse transcription. is a 21- to 23-kDa basic protein that was originally purified from bovine brain (1Bernier I. Jolles P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 174-181Google Scholar) which shows preferential affinities for phosphatidylethanolamine (2Bernier I. Tresca J.P. Jolles P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 19-23Google Scholar), a component of the cell membranes for nucleotides like GTP and GDPs and for small GTP-binding proteins (3Bucquoy S. Jolles P. Schoentgen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1203-1210Google Scholar). Species orthologues of PEBP show a high degree of sequence similarity (4Perry A.C.F. Hall L. Bell E. Jones R. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 235-242Google Scholar) and are expressed in many tissues, such as the testis, adrenal gland, liver, and kidney (5Frayne J. Ingram C. Love S. Hall L. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 298: 415-423Google Scholar), suggesting that the proteins have an important and conserved biological function. PEBP is believed to be the precursor of hippocampal neurostimulatory peptide, a bioactive peptide which is involved in the development of the hippocampus (6Tohdoh N. Tojo S. Agui H. Ojika K. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 381-384Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. The mammalian MAPKs can be divided into extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. All MAPK pathways utilize a three-kinase cascade mechanism. Thus, each MAPK has upstream-activating kinases (MAPKKs) that are, in turn, regulated by MAPKK kinases (7Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Google Scholar). In response to a wide range of extracellular stimuli, the MAPK cascades determine cell fate, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (7Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Google Scholar). The Raf-1/MAPKK (MEK)/ERK signaling pathway is activated by Ras and other factors and commonly transmits cell proliferation signals to a variety of cell types (8Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Google Scholar, 9Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar). Mutated and constitutively activated forms of Ras are found in 30% of human cancers (10Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689Google Scholar); the pathway is activated in many cancer cells and is important for oncogenic transformation (11Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Google Scholar). PEBP has been demonstrated to bind to Raf-1 and MEK and thereby inhibits the ERK pathway, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation (12Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Google Scholar). Recently, PEBP was also reported to bind to thrombin (13Hengst U. Albrecht H. Hess D. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 535-540Google Scholar) and heterotrimeric G-protein (14Kroslak T. Koch T. Kahl E. Hollt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39772-39778Google Scholar). Thrombin exerts a mitogenic effect, and Raf-1 is phosphorylated upon binding of thrombin to a G protein-coupled receptor (15Apostolidis A. Weiss R.H. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 439-445Google Scholar). Cell proliferation and differentiation are reciprocally regulated in many cell lines (16Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). In the skin, there is a balance between proliferation of mitotically active keratinocytes in the basal layer and differentiation of post-mitotic cells within the suprabasal layers of the epidermis (17Murphy G.F. Elder D. Lever's Histopathology of the Skin. 8th Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1997: 5-50Google Scholar). Under certain pathological conditions such as tumor, this equilibrium is disturbed. Epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-β are known as in vitro stimulators of keratinocyte proliferation (18Rheinwald J.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; 21: 229-254Google Scholar, 19Coffey Jr., R.J. Derynck R. Wilcox J.N. Bringman T.G. Goustin A.S. Moses H.L. Pittelkow M.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 817-820Google Scholar). On the other hand, elevation of extracellular calcium levels induces rapid cell-cycle arrest in keratinocytes (20Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holdbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Google Scholar, 21Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Google Scholar) and morphological changes accompanying increased expression of differentiation-associated proteins such as involucrin (22Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Google Scholar). Calcium treatment, however, is reported to induce transient activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (23Schmidt M. Goebeler M. Posern G. Feller S.M. Seitz C.S. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41011-41017Google Scholar), the pathway being associated with not only cell proliferation but also differentiation in certain cell lines (24Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Google Scholar, 25Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Google Scholar). Although PEBP is suggested to inhibit cell proliferation, it remains to be clarified whether it is also involved in differentiation induction. In the present study, PEBP expression was immunohistochemically examined in normal human skin and squamous cell carcinomas with different differentiation properties. Its expression was also examined in cultured keratinocytes in which differentiation was induced by calcium treatment. These studies showed enhanced PEBP expression in keratinocyte differentiation, and transfection with expression vector revealed PEBP as a causative factor for differentiation induction. Purification of PEBP—PEBP was purified from human kidney according to the method of Bernier and Jolles (1Bernier I. Jolles P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 174-181Google Scholar) with modifications employing S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose affinity column. Human kidney was homogenized in 5 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was applied to DE52-cellulose column (2.0 × 25 cm) (Whatman International Ltd.) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The non-absorbed fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0), 1 mm EDTA, and then applied to a CM-Sephadex C-50 column (1.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with the buffer, absorbed proteins were eluted in a stepwise manner with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.08 m, 0.15 m, and 0.5 m) in the buffer. The fractions eluted with 0.5 m NaCl were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and applied to an S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose column (26Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 1304-1310Google Scholar) (1.2 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with the buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm triethylamine-HCl (pH 11.0) and submitted to chromatofocusing chromatography with a PBE 118™ column (1.0 × 28 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm triethylamine-HCl (pH 11.0). Elution was carried out with 400 ml of Pharmalyte™ (pH 8–10.5), which was diluted 80-fold with deaerated water and adjusted to pH 7.0 with HCl. PEBP was eluted from the PBE 118™ column at pH 9.3. The final PEBP preparation exhibited only a band with subunit Mr = 23 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This band was stained by immunoblot analysis with anti-C-terminal peptide of PEBP antibody. N-Terminal amino acid sequence of this preparation was identical with that reported for human PEBP (6Tohdoh N. Tojo S. Agui H. Ojika K. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 381-384Google Scholar). N-Terminal amino acid sequencing was performed with 490 Procise protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Urayasu, Japan). Production of Anti-PEBP Antibody—PEBP (100 μg protein) purified from human kidney was dialyzed against 12 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 145 mm NaCl, emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Iatron Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan), and then injected subcutaneously three times into albino rabbits at 1-week intervals. On the seventh day after the last injection, PEBP without the adjuvant was injected subcutaneously. The rabbits were bled on the seventh day after the booster injection. The antibody was purified from the antiserum by 20–33% saturated ammonium sulfate and then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. A C-terminal 14-amino acid peptide of PEBP synthesized by a peptide synthesizer (model 432A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with m-maleimidobenzoyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (27Peeters J.M. Hazendonk T.G. Beuvery E.C. Tesser G.I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 120: 133-143Google Scholar). This conjugate was similarly immunized to a rabbit as PEBP, and the anti-C-terminal peptide of PEBP antibody was prepared. Immunohistochemistry—Skin tissues were obtained at surgery in the Department of Dermatology, Hirosaki University Hospital from four patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Samples containing normal and carcinoma tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 μm thick) were routinely passed through xylene and a graded alcohol series and stained for PEBP by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method (28Hsu S. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Google Scholar) using the specific antibodies. Affinity-purified, biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G and ABC complex (Vectastain ABC kit, PK4001) were obtained from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA). The sites of peroxidase binding were determined by the diaminobenzidine method. Sections were then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin for microscopic examination. As negative controls, preimmune rabbit serum or antibody absorbed with PEBP were used instead of the antibody. Cell Culture—Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Cells were plated in 60-mm plastic tissue-culture dishes using 0.03 mm calcium keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) (Cambrex Bioscience Walkersville, Inc.) and grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The medium was changed every other day. After the 3rd passage, at 60–70% confluence, cultures were switched to either 2.0 or 0.03 mm calcium KGM. After 48 h, cells were harvested. HaCaT cells (29Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Google Scholar) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimum essential medium without calcium (Invitrogen) containing 8% chelex-treated FBS. HaCaT cells at 70% confluence were transfected with 2 μg of pCY4B-PEBP cDNA or pCY4B vectors in Eagle's minimum essential medium using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, cells were cultured in 0.03 mm calcium KGM for up to 48 h. Northern Blotting—Twelve μg of total RNA were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at –80 °C. cDNA probes for PEBP (6Tohdoh N. Tojo S. Agui H. Ojika K. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 381-384Google Scholar), involucrin (30Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Google Scholar), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (31Arcari P. Martinelli R. Salvatore F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9179-9189Google Scholar) were generated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The nucleotide sequences of these cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing with a BigDye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI DNA sequencer Model 310 (Applied Biosystems). Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by comparing the intensity of the GAPDH mRNA band in each lane. Quantitation of the results was performed by scanning the x-ray film with Photoshop version 5.5 software (Adobe Systems, Inc.) followed by densitometry with NIH Image version 1.62. Western Blotting—Proteins (20 or 100 μg/track) were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electroblotting to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with anti-PEBP antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000 (v/v), Bio-Rad). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a detection reagent. In some experiments, anti-loricrin antibody (BAbCO), anti-involucrin monoclonal antibody, anti-ERK2 antibody, or anti-phosphorylated ERK antibody (sc-21748, sc-1647, and sc-7383, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used as the first antibody. Construction of Expression Vector for PEBP—For construction of expression vector for PEBP, cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame was generated by nested RT-PCR using primer sets designed to contain the XhoI and NotI linkers. Reverse transcription and the first PCR were performed using BcaBest RNA-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA isolated from cultured normal human keratinocytes by incubation at 65 °C for 1 min, 30 °C for 5 min, 65 °C for 15 min, 98 °C for 5 min, and 5 °C for 5 min in a reaction volume of 20 μl containing 22 units of BcaBest polymerase, 1× buffer, 500 μm of each dNTP, 2.5 μm of oligo dT primer, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor. The first PCR conditions were at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 50 s, containing the all reverse-transcription mixture (2.5 units Bca-Optimized Taq, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1× buffer, 0.2 μm of the primers). The 5′ primer 5′-TTTCTCGAGGCCATGCCGGTGGACCTCAGCAAG-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-ACAGTTCAGGTCCCCAAGCTA-3′ (34Hori N. Chae K.S. Murakawa K. Matoba R. Fukushima A. Okubo K. Matsubara K. Gene. 1994; 140: 293-294Google Scholar) were used for the first amplification. The second PCR was performed using KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). For the second amplification, first-round amplification mixture was diluted by 100-fold with water and 1 μl of the solution was used. The 5′ primer was 5′-TTTCTCGAGGCCATGCCGGTGGACCTCAGCAAG-3′ and the 3′ primer was 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCAAGCTAACCCCCTACTTCCCA-3′. PCR conditions were at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 2 s, and extension at 74 °C for 30 s, containing 2.5 units KOD DNA polymerase, 1× buffer, 0.2 μm of primers, and 200 μm of each dNTP. Each amplified cDNA was digested with XhoI and NotI and the digest was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel. The 585-bp fragment containing the entire PEBP open reading frame was ligated downstream of a cytomegalovirus-IE enhancer and β-actin promoter in the plasmid pCY4B, which is derived from pCAGGS expression vector (35Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Google Scholar). pCY4B was kindly donated by Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki (Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The nucleotide sequence of PEBP cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing (36Hyder S.M. Hu C. Needleman D.S. Sonoda Y. Wang X.-Y. Baker V.V. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 478-482Google Scholar). Cell Growth—Cell growth was determined with a CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells seeded at a density of 2 × 103/180 μl of culture medium in 96-well tissue culture plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for up to 48 h. Then, 20 μl of substrate solution was added to each well, and the plates were further incubated for 3 h. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a microplate reader Model 550 (Bio-Rad). Fluorescent Immunostaining—For fluorescent immunostaining, HaCaT cells transfected with expression vector or control vector were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 100% methanol for 1 min, and then incubated with anti-PEBP antibody for 2 h. After washing with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 145 mm NaCl three times, the cells were incubated with secondary antibody (fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated pig anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody) (Dako Cytomation, Kyoto, Japan) for 1 h. After washing with the same buffer, the cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). PEBP Expression in Human Skin Keratinocytes—PEBP expression in normal human skin was examined by immunohistochemistry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A typical staining pattern for PEBP is shown in Fig. 1A. PEBP was not stained in the basal layer but was stained in the cytoplasm of the spinous and granular layers. In addition, the granular layer was more heavily stained than the lower part of the spinous layer. Control staining using preimmune serum and antibody absorbed with PEBP proved negative (Fig. 1B). The expression of PEBP was also examined in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Differentiated carcinoma retained a positive staining result (Fig. 1C), whereas undifferentiated carcinoma showed negativity (Fig. 1D). Data presented in Fig. 1 were obtained with antibody against PEBP, and similar results were also obtained with antibody against the C-terminal peptide (data not shown). These results suggested that PEBP expression may be dependent upon the differentiation of the epidermis in vivo and is lacking in proliferating basal cells. PEBP Expression in Keratinocyte Differentiation Induced by Calcium—To examine the relationship between PEBP expression and cell differentiation, NHEK cells were treated with 2.0 mm CaCl2 to induce keratinocyte differentiation (22Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Google Scholar). On microscopic examination, cells incubated with 0.03 mm CaCl2 for 48 h retained an elongated shape and loose arrangement (Fig. 2A, a), whereas cells incubated with 2.0 mm CaCl2 were densely packed and exhibited polygonal shapes (Fig. 2A, b). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the protein level of PEBP was increased in cells treated with a high concentration of calcium, as compared with a low calcium case (Fig. 2B). The effects of 2.0 mm calcium treatment on the levels of PEBP mRNA and involucrin mRNA, a marker for keratinocyte differentiation (37Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Google Scholar), in NHEK cells were evaluated by Northern blotting; typical results are presented in Fig. 2C. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments. PEBP mRNA and involucrin mRNA levels were increased to 1.8-fold and 2-fold, respectively, 6 h after treatment with 2.0 mm CaCl2, and their increases were continued by 48 h. The time course of alterations in involucrin mRNA level was similar to that for PEBP mRNA. These levels were not altered in cells treated with 0.03 mm CaCl2 (data not shown). These results indicate that PEBP expression was enhanced in keratinocyte differentiation induced by calcium. Differentiation Induction and Repression of Cell Proliferation in HaCaT Cells by PEBP Expression—To study whether PEBP expression can induce differentiation and repression of cell proliferation in keratinocytes, a PEBP expression vector was constructed by ligating a PEBP cDNA to pCY4B containing a cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter (35Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, derived from human skin, was used for transfection experiments because of low basal PEBP protein level, which is about one-tenth that of NHEK cells (data not shown). HaCaT cells transfected with a PEBP expression vector were subjected to fluorescent immunostaining with anti-PEBP antibody to examine its expression in individual cells and transfection efficiency. 47% of cells exhibited positive staining for PEBP, and 95% of positive cells showed an enlarged and flattened shape (Fig. 3, A and C). PEBP-negative cells retained small and round or spindle shapes, exhibiting properties similar to cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 3, B and D). Positive staining was never observed in control transfectants. To study the effects of PEBP expression on differentiation induction, expression of involucrin was examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). Involucrin was increased in cells transfected with a PEBP expression vector, as compared with that in the empty vector case. Increased PEBP levels were confirmed in its transfectants, and endogenous PEBP levels were negligible in control cells. Loricrin expression was not detected in PEBP transfectants as well as control cells (data not shown).Fig. 4Enhanced involucrin expression and depressed ERK phosphorylation in HaCaT cells transfected with PEBP expression vector. HaCaT cells transfected with pCY4B-PEBP expression vector or control vector were cultured for 24 and 48 h. Cytosol fractions from cells cultured for 24 h (lane 1) and 48 h (lane 2) were analyzed for PEBP (A), involucrin (B), ERK (C), and phosphorylated ERK (D) proteins by immunoblotting, as described for Fig. 2. Cytosolic fractions were also prepared from cells transfected with control vector (lanes 3 and 4, cultured for 24 and 48 h, respectively). Each lane contained 100 μg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of PEBP expression on proliferation of HaCaT cells were also analyzed. Cell proliferation was evaluated by a colorimetric method employing a tetrazolium substrate. Absorbance at 490 nm was linear in the range of 0.3–1.5, corresponding to 3000–15,000 cells/well. PEBP expression repressed cell proliferation almost completely during the first 12 h, but thereafter, absorbance was increased at a lower rate: the value at 48 h was 60% of that for cells without expression (Fig. 5). In transfection experiments with PEBP expression vector, about half of the cells showed PEBP expression, and this may be responsible for partial inhibition of cell proliferation. To examine whether the MEK/ERK pathway is involved in growth suppression because of PEBP expression, the alteration in MEK activity was evaluated by measuring the phosphorylated ERK level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that PEBP expression did not alter the ERK level (Fig. 4C) but repressed the phosphorylated ERK level (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that PEBP blocked the MEK/ERK pathway. The ERK cascade, composed of Raf/MEK/ERK, is mainly involved in the stimulation of cell proliferation in a variety of cells (38Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Google Scholar, 39Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Google Scholar). Addition of a high concentration of calcium to the culture medium is known to induce cell-cycle arrest and differentiation of normal human keratinocytes by blocking the ERK pathway (40Medema J.P. Sark M.W. Backendorf C. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7078-7085Google Scholar). However, calcium-induced up-regulation of the differentiation marker involucrin is repressed by MEK inhibitors, PD98059 or U0126, suggesting that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may enhance differentiation-specific gene expression (23Schmidt M. Goebeler M. Posern G. Feller S.M. Seitz C.S. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41011-41017Google Scholar). To clarify the role of the ERK pathway in differentiation induction, we examined whether PEBP expression resulted in keratinocyte differentiation. The present study has demonstrated that PEBP is not expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis with a cell proliferation potential but is expressed in the spinous and granular layers consisting of differentiating keratinocytes (Fig. 1). The protein is expressed in differentiated carcinoma but not in undifferentiated carcinoma. PEBP expression is enhanced in NHEK differentiation induced by a high concentration of calcium (Fig. 2, B and C). To rule out the possibility that PEBP expression is secondary to differentiation of NHEK cells following calcium treatment, we conducted a PEBP-expression experiment. Transfection experiments have revealed that HaCaT keratinocytes expressing PEBP exhibited characters of differentiated cells (Figs. 3 and 4B) and a partial inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 5). The latter finding seems to be due to the incomplete transfection efficiency of the expression vector. PEBP expression repressed MEK activities in keratinocytes (Fig. 4D), confirming the function of PEBP reported in fibroblasts (12Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Google Scholar). Thus, decreased MEK activities were suggested to be responsible for suppression of cell proliferation by PEBP. These results also suggest that PEBP is involved in calcium-induced suppression of cell proliferation and differentiation. PEBP expression up-regulated the involucrin level but did not alter the loricrin level, suggesting that PEBP differentiates keratinocytes to an early rather than a late stage. Transient activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by epidermal growth factor is known to result in cellular proliferation of PC12 cells, whereas sustained activation of the pathway by nerve growth factor promotes differentiation of the cells into sympathetic-like neurons (16Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 24Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Google Scholar, 41York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Google Scholar). Other studies, however, have reported that sustained ERK activation alone is not sufficient to induce differentiation, and the p38 MAPK pathway is also involved in its differentiation (42Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Google Scholar, 43Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Google Scholar). Transient activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway within 10–15 min is suggested to be responsible for calcium-induced differentiation of HaCaT keratinocytes (23Schmidt M. Goebeler M. Posern G. Feller S.M. Seitz C.S. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41011-41017Google Scholar). In the present study, alterations in PEBP and involucrin mRNA levels showed a similar time course: induction of their expression occurred 6 h after calcium treatment (Fig. 2C). Calcium may trigger activation of multiple pathways to induce differentiation in keratinocytes (44Xie Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20421-20424Google Scholar). It has been suggested that protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in calcium or TPA-induced keratinocyte differentiation and that certain PKC isoforms (δ, ϵ, etc.) stimulate involucrin gene expression through p38 MAPK activation (37Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Google Scholar, 45Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Google Scholar, 46Deucher A. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17032-17040Google Scholar). The p38 MAPK pathway is also involved in keratinocyte differentiation (47Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Google Scholar). Although PEBP inhibits the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the nuclear factor-κB activation pathway (48Yeung K.C. Rose D.W. Dhillon A.S. Yaros D. Gustafsson M. Chatterjee D. McFerran B. Wyche J. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7207-7217Google Scholar), it remains to be clarified whether PEBP affects p38 MAPK activity. Thus, because the MEK/ERK pathway is not a sole target of PEBP, other targets may be involved in PEBP-induced differentiation. A p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, did not affect differentiation induction and PEBP expression in NHEK cells after calcium treatment (data not shown). A recent study (49Corbit K.C. Trakul N. Eves E.M. Diaz B. Marshall M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13061-13068Google Scholar) has revealed that some PKC isoforms (ζ, α, β, etc.) phosphorylate PEBP at the Ser-153 residue, and its phosphorylation causes the release of PEBP from Raf-1, thereby enhancing the signal of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Furthermore, phosphorylated PEBP can associate with G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 to block its activity (50Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. Quitterer U. Nature. 2003; 426: 574-579Google Scholar). Because the kinase inhibits signal transduction of the G protein-coupled receptor-mediated pathway, phosphorylated PEBP recovers the pathway from inhibition by the kinase. Thus, both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated PEBP act as signal modifiers between the two pathways. Certain protein kinases involved in signal transduction bind to some proteins, and their kinase activities are regulated by complex formation. For example, JNK binds to glutathione S-transferase (51Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.V. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Google Scholar), and apoptosis-signaling protein kinase forms a complex with thioredoxin (52Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Google Scholar). Disulfide bond formation in glutathione S-transferase due to oxidative stress has been suggested to be a signal for the release of JNK from the complex, and the resultant free JNK exhibits a kinase activity (51Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.V. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Google Scholar). PEBP has two cysteine residues (Cys-132 and Cys-167) (34Hori N. Chae K.S. Murakawa K. Matoba R. Fukushima A. Okubo K. Matsubara K. Gene. 1994; 140: 293-294Google Scholar) and is reported to form a disulfide bond under oxidative conditions (53Bollengier F. Beeckmans S. Mahler A. Kanarek L. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1123-1126Google Scholar). In the present study, we found PEBP to bind to S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose, and this property was used for purification. Several proteins with reactive cysteine residues are reported to bind to the affinity matrix (54Kajihara-Kano H. Hayakari M. Satoh K. Tomioka Y. Mizugaki M. Tsuchida S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 473-478Google Scholar). Raf-1 is demonstrated to bind to the domain corresponding to amino acid residues 77–108 of PEBP (55Yeung K. Janosch P. McFerran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Google Scholar), which is in proximity to the Cys residues. Thus, in addition to phosphorylation, disulfide bond formation in PEBP under oxidative conditions may be involved in the release and activation of Raf-1. In conclusion, PEBP is shown to be expressed in the spinous and granular layers of the epidermis and, in addition to inhibition of cell proliferation, PEBP can induce differentiation of human keratinocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2151076819,"Carnitine acyltransferases catalyze the exchange of acyl groups between coenzyme A (CoA) and carnitine. They have important roles in many cellular processes, especially the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, and are attractive targets for drug discovery against diabetes and obesity. These enzymes are classified based on their substrate selectivity for short-chain, medium-chain, or long-chain fatty acids. Structural information on carnitine acetyltransferase suggests that residues Met-564 and Phe-565 may be important determinants of substrate selectivity with the side chain of Met-564 located in the putative binding pocket for acyl groups. Both residues are replaced by glycine in carnitine palmitoyltransferases. To assess the functional relevance of this structural observation, we have replaced these two residues with small amino acids by mutagenesis, characterized the substrate preference of the mutants, and determined the crystal structures of two of these mutants. Kinetic studies confirm that the M564G or M564A mutation is sufficient to increase the activity of the enzyme toward medium-chain substrates with hexanoyl-CoA being the preferred substrate for the M564G mutant. The crystal structures of the M564G mutant, both alone and in complex with carnitine, reveal a deep binding pocket that can accommodate the larger acyl group. We have determined the crystal structure of the F565A mutant in a ternary complex with both the carnitine and CoA substrates at a 1.8-Å resolution. The F565A mutation has minor effects on the structure or the substrate preference of the enzyme.

Carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) 1The abbreviations used are: CrAT, carnitine acetyltransferase; CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferases; r.m.s., root mean square. belongs to the family of carnitine acyltransferases, which catalyze the exchange between acyl-CoA and acylcarnitine (1Colucci W.J. Gandour R.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 307-334Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar, 3Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Google Scholar, 4Evans A.M. Fornasini G. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2003; 42: 941-967Google Scholar). The enzymes of this family are classified based on their substrate selectivity. CrAT prefers short-chain fatty acids, whereas carnitine octanoyltransferase prefers medium-chain fatty acids. The exchange reaction for the long-chain fatty acids is catalyzed by the carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPTs). These enzymes generally contain ∼600 residues and have significant sequence homology. For example, the amino acid sequence identity between CrAT and the other carnitine acyltransferases is ∼35%. However, these enzymes do not share any recognizable sequence homology with other proteins in the data base. The CPTs have crucial roles in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation (2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar). In humans, three different CPT enzymes (CPT-Ia, CPT-Ib, and CPT-Ic) are associated with the outer membrane of the mitochondria and a fourth CPT enzyme (CPT-II) is located in the mitochondrial matrix (3Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations of these proteins are linked with hypoketonemia, hypoglycemia, and other diseases (2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar, 3Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Google Scholar). Inhibitors of these enzymes may be efficacious for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (5Anderson R.C. Curr. Pharmacol. Des. 1998; 4: 1-16Google Scholar, 6Lenhard J.M. Gottschalk W.K. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2002; 54: 1199-1212Google Scholar). At the same time, agonists of these enzymes can stimulate fatty-acid oxidation and may regulate body weight (7Thupari J.N. Landree L.E. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9498-9502Google Scholar). Consequently, there is currently a considerable amount of interest in the carnitine acyltransferases. We recently reported the crystal structure of mouse CrAT alone and in complex with its substrate carnitine or CoA (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). The structure of the free enzyme of human CrAT has also been reported (9Wu D. Govindasamy L. Lian W. Gu Y. Kukar T. Agbandje-McKenna M. McKenna R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13159-13165Google Scholar). The structures demonstrate that the carnitine acyltransferases are made up of two domains (N and C domains) of the same backbone fold and that the active site is located at the interface between the two domains (Fig. 1A) (10Ramsay R.R. Naismith J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 343-346Google Scholar). The carnitine and CoA substrates are bound in a tunnel on opposite sides of the catalytic His-343 residue. The carboxylate group of carnitine has four hydrogen bonds with the enzyme, and its negative charge is balanced by the side chain of the strictly conserved Arg-518 residue. In contrast, the positively charged trimethylammonium ion of carnitine interacts with several hydrophobic side chains. The structural information suggests that this cation may be important for stabilizing the oxyanion in the tetrahedral transition state of the reaction (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar), an example of substrate-assisted catalysis (11Dall'Acqua W. Carter P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1-9Google Scholar). The structures of the carnitine and CoA complexes identify a potential binding site for the acyl group of the substrate (Fig. 1B) and suggest that Met-564 and Phe-565 in this pocket may be strong determinants of the preference for short-chain fatty acids by CrAT (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). To assess the functional roles of these residues in the substrate selectivity of carnitine acyltransferases, we have created and characterized single-site mutants in this binding pocket of mouse CrAT based on the structural information. Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Residues 30–626 of wild-type mouse CrAT was subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) and overexpressed in Escherichia coli (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). The expression construct contains an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The mutants were designed based on the structural information, created with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and verified by sequencing. The wild-type and mutant proteins were purified following the same protocol with nickel-agarose, anion-exchange, and gel-filtration chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 80 mg/ml in a solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5) and 200 mm NaCl, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 5% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at –80 °C. >20 mg of highly pure wild-type and mutant enzymes were obtained from the preparation. The protein samples migrated as a single peak from the gel-filtration column. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of the M564G mutant were obtained at 4 °C by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and the protein was at 25 mg/ml concentration. For cryoprotection, the crystals were transferred to a solution containing 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K. They belong to space group P43 with cell parameters of a = b = 72.2 Å and c = 128.8 Å. There is one molecule of the mutant protein in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Crystals of the M564G mutant protein in complex with carnitine were obtained by soaking the free enzyme crystals with 2.5 mm carnitine for 16 h. Crystals of the F565A mutant were obtained at 4 °C by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and 2.3 mm carnitine, and the protein was at a concentration of 38 mg/ml. The crystals then were soaked in 5 mm acetyl-CoA for 2 h before being flash-frozen for data collection. They belong to space group C2 with cell parameters of a = 165.1 Å, b = 89.6 Å, c = 123.0 Å, and β = 129.2°. There are two molecules of the mutant protein in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) as well as on a R-AxisIV imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator. The diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The initial structures of the mutants were determined by the molecular replacement method with the program COMO (13Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 782-784Google Scholar, 14Jogl G. Tao X. Xu Y. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1127-1134Google Scholar). The structure refinement was carried out with the program CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic Studies—The substrate preference of wild-type and mutant CrAT enzymes were determined by kinetic studies following a protocol reported earlier (17Ramsay R.R. Derrick J.P. Friend A.S. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 271-278Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 125 μm 4,4′-dithiobispyridine (dissolved in ethanol), 0.5 mm CoA, 2 mm carnitine, and 0.5 μg of enzyme in a volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 324 nm. The assays were repeated 2–5 times for each enzyme preparation with each substrate to verify the observed reaction rates. Selection of Residues for Mutagenesis—Based on the crystal structure of mouse CrAT in complex with carnitine, we predicted the possible binding mode of acetylcarnitine (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). For the current studies, we modeled the compound octanoylcarnitine in the binding site, assuming a mostly extended conformation for the acyl group (Fig. 1B). The octanoyl group is chosen as a representative of medium-chain acyl groups. In the model, it is located in a pocket that is formed between helix α12 and strands β1, β8, β13, β14, and β15, supporting our earlier prediction that this may be the binding site for longer acyl groups. Interestingly, the residues that are in close proximity of the octanoyl group are poorly conserved among the carnitine acyltransferases (Fig. 1C). This also supports the identification of this pocket for binding acyl groups, as sequence variations are needed to modulate the size of this pocket to accommodate the different substrate preferences of these enzymes. The sequence comparison shows that residues Met-564 and Phe-565 in strand β14 may play important roles in determining the substrate specificity. The side chain of Met-564 is located in the center of the pocket and actually clashes with the modeled conformation of the octanoyl group (Fig. 1B). In all of the other carnitine acyltransferases, this residue is replaced by a glycine (Fig. 1C), which should relieve the steric clash between the octanoyl group and the enzyme. The side chain of Phe-565 is sandwiched between strand β1 and helix α11 (Fig. 1B). This residue is replaced with a glycine in the CPTs and with a valine in carnitine octanoyltransferase (Fig. 1C). Reducing the bulk of this side chain could affect the positioning of the β1 and β14 strands and thereby change the shape of the binding pocket. As a first attempt to understand the molecular basis for substrate selectivity by the carnitine acyltransferases, we chose to mutate these two residues and characterize the effects of the mutation on the catalysis by the enzyme and the structure of the enzyme. Mutation at Met-564 Can Change Substrate Preference— Based on the structural and sequence information, we designed the M564G, M564A, and F565A single-site mutants. These mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified in large quantities using the same protocol as that for the wild-type enzyme. The mutant proteins are monomeric in solution and appear to be as stable as the wild-type enzyme. The substrate preference of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes were determined by kinetic studies using short-chain (acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA), medium-chain (hexanoyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA), and long-chain (decanoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA) substrates at saturating concentrations. The concentration of the carnitine substrate is also at the saturating level. The assays were repeated several times for each mutant and for each substrate, and consistent results were obtained from these experiments (Fig. 2). The kinetic data show that the wild-type enzyme has higher activity with the short-chain substrates than with the medium-chain substrates (Fig. 2). In comparison, the M564G and M564A mutants have significantly better catalytic activity with the medium-chain substrates. Especially, the preferred substrate for the M564G mutant appears to be hexanoyl-CoA, rather than acetyl-CoA (Fig. 2). This supports our hypothesis based on the structural information that the Met-564 residue is important for substrate selectivity, and removing the bulk of this side chain has altered the substrate preference profile of the enzyme. Interestingly, the M564A mutant has roughly equal activity with the short-chain and medium-chain substrates, suggesting that the extra methyl group has a strong influence on substrate selectivity. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of the F565A mutant with the medium-chain substrates is still very weak (Fig. 2). In fact, the substrate preference of this mutant closely mimics that of the wild-type enzyme. Neither the wild-type enzyme nor any of the mutants have significant activity with the long-chain substrates (Fig. 2). Additional structural differences between CrAT and the CPTs may be necessary to accommodate these longer acyl groups. An Enlarged Acyl Group Binding Pocket in the Structures of the M564G Mutant—To assess the effects of the M564G mutation on the conformation of the enzyme, we have determined the crystal structures of this mutant, both alone and in complex with carnitine, at a resolution of up to 1.9 Å (Table I). Several attempts at determining the binding modes of the acyl groups, especially the hexanoyl or octanoyl group, have so far not been successful. This is consistent with our earlier experiences with the wild-type enzyme, which showed that the acyl groups are hydrolyzed during the crystallization process (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). The overall structure of the M564G mutant is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme with a r.m.s. distance of 0.52 Å for 591 equivalent Cα atoms between them. The M564G mutation introduced only minor changes in the conformation of this residue with the Cα atom shifting by ∼0.5 Å (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, larger conformational changes are observed in several other residues in the active site region. Most pronounced among these is the change in the position of the side chain of Val-556, which partly fills the void left by the absence of the Met-564 side chain (Fig. 3A). In the wild-type enzyme, Val-556 interacts with the beginning of helix α12. In the mutant, these residues (amino acids 345–352) show large conformational changes that may be coupled with the change in the Val-556 side chain (Fig. 3A). Carnitine is bound in the active site of the M564G mutant at the same position as that observed in the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3A). The carboxylate group of carnitine is involved in the same intricate network of hydrogen-bonding interactions with the enzyme. Although the main chain of Glu-347 has undergone a conformational change due to the mutation, its side-chain carboxylate is located at the same position as in the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3A), maintaining its role in the binding of carnitine. There are only small structural changes in the enzyme upon carnitine binding. The r.m.s. distance between Cα atoms of the free enzyme and the carnitine complex is only 0.24 Å. The side chain of Ser-454 assumes a different rotamer to hydrogen bond to the carboxylate of carnitine. This change was also observed in the wild-type enzyme (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). The removal of the Met-564 side chain in the M564G mutant produces a dramatic change in the surface of the protein, such that there is now a clearly defined deep pocket in the mutant enzyme that can readily accommodate the hexanoyl group (Fig. 3B). In contrast, this pocket is much shallower in the wild-type enzyme, which may only have enough space for a butyryl group (Fig. 3C). This finding is consistent with kinetic observations on most CrATs (Fig. 2), which showed that the enzymes have good activity for acetyl, propionyl, and butyryl groups but poorer activity for longer acyl substrates (1Colucci W.J. Gandour R.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 307-334Google Scholar). Minor Structural Changes in the F565A Mutant—We have determined the crystal structure of the F565A mutant at a 1.8-Å resolution (Table I). A comparison to the structure of the wild-type CrAT showed that the F565A mutation introduced only minor differences in the structure of the enzyme, including the positions of the β1 and β14 strands (Fig. 4). The side chain of Ile-123 adopts a different rotamer in the F565A mutant, occupying a small portion of the void created by the mutation (Fig. 4). The Met-564 side chain in the acyl group binding pocket has essentially the same conformation as in the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, the structural information explains our kinetic observation that the F565A mutant still prefers short-chain acyl groups as substrates (Fig. 2). It remains to be seen whether the F565A or F565G mutation can have a larger impact on substrate selectivity when it is coupled with the M564G mutation. In fact, the Val-563 residue of CrAT is replaced by a glycine in the CPTs as well (Fig. 1C). We have created the triple mutant that replaced the 563VMF565 residues in CrAT with three Gly residues. Unfortunately, this mutant is unstable in solution and we were not able to characterize it kinetically or structurally. Structure of CrAT in a Ternary Complex with Carnitine and CoA—The F565A mutant crystal was grown in the presence of carnitine and soaked for 2 h in a solution containing 5 mm acetyl-CoA. The crystal then was transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing an additional 25% ethylene glycol for 1 min before being flash-frozen. The shorter soaking time was chosen in an attempt to minimize the hydrolysis of the acetyl group by the enzyme. However, the crystallographic analysis revealed the electron density for a CoA molecule in the active site (Fig. 5A) without the acetyl group. Even more amazingly, we observed the binding of an ethylene glycol molecule in the active site (Fig. 5B and see below). This finding suggests that the hydrolysis must have happened for 1 min in the cryoprotectant solution because ethylene glycol cannot bind in the active site unless (acetyl-)CoA leaves the pocket. Clear electron density for the carnitine substrate was also observed (Fig. 5C). Therefore, this is the structure of CrAT in a ternary complex with carnitine and CoA, which for the first time allows us to examine the simultaneous binding of both substrates to this enzyme. The two molecules of the F565A mutant in the asymmetric unit of the crystal have the same conformation with a r.m.s. distance of 0.26 Å for their equivalent Cα atoms. The bound conformations of the CoA and carnitine substrates are also the same in the two active sites. The overall structure of the ternary complex of the F565A mutant (Fig. 5D) is highly similar to that of the wild-type enzyme with a r.m.s. distance of 0.35 Å to the structure of the wild-type free enzyme. In the ternary complex, carnitine has the same interactions with the enzyme as those in the binary complex that we observed earlier (Fig. 5E) (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group of carnitine is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of the catalytic His-343 residue with a distance of 2.7 Å. In comparison, the thiol group of CoA in the ternary complex is 1.2 Å away from its position in the binary complex (Fig. 5E), such that this group is not hydrogen-bonded to the His-343 side chain (distance of 3.8 Å) in the ternary complex. Interestingly, the distance between the hydroxyl group of carnitine and the thiol group of CoA is only 2.8 Å in the ternary complex, suggesting a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction between the two substrates. The thiol group in the ternary complex may also have a weak interaction with the main chain amide group of Gly-348 with a distance of 3.5 Å. Two side chains in the active site, Glu-347 and Ser-454, assume different rotamers in the ternary complex as compared with the free enzyme structure (Fig. 4). The change in the side chain of Ser-454 enables it to be hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of carnitine, and this change was also observed in the binary complex with carnitine (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar). The side chain of Glu-347 in the free enzyme conformation is in steric clash with the thiol group of CoA in the ternary complex. Interestingly, the conformation of this side chain in the ternary complex is the same as that in the binary complex with CoA (8Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Google Scholar), and it can also maintain the hydrogen bond to the water molecule that mediates the binding of the carboxylate group of carnitine (Fig. 5E). The ethylene glycol molecule is placed in the acyl group binding site (Fig. 5E). One of its hydroxyl groups is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Ser-554, mimicking the interaction from the carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group of the substrate, whereas the other hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Tyr-341. The ethylene group has van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Met-564 and Phe-566. Our structural and biochemical studies show that the Met-564 residue has an important role in determining the substrate preference of CrAT. Met-564 is part of a cluster of three residues, 563VMF565, that are replaced by glycine in the CPTs. These residues are located in strand β14, which helps enclose the acyl group binding site. Besides these three amino acids, several other clusters of residues show significant sequence differences among the carnitine acyltransferases (Fig. 1C). It is probable that these other sites also play a role, and further studies will be needed to fully characterize the molecular basis for substrate selectivity of these enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2017885127,"The secreted semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a member of a large family of proteins that act as guidance signals for axons and dendrites. While the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate the repulsive effects of semaphorins are beginning to be understood in some detail, the mechanisms that are responsible for the ability of Sema3A to stimulate the extension of dendrites remain to be elucidated. Here we show that PC12 cells, a model widely used to study neuronal differentiation, can be used to dissect this pathway. Sema3A is as effective as nerve growth factor in stimulating the extension of neurites from PC12 cells. We show that Sema3A is able to regulate gene expression and identify mitochondria as a novel target of Sema3A signaling. Pharmacological block of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production abolishes the extension of neurites in response to Sema3A. These results show that the characterization of transcripts that are regulated by axon guidance signals may help to identify novel components of their signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2152581399,"We found for the first time that Zygomycetes species showed resistance to Aureobasidin A, an antifungal agent. A novel family of neutral glycosphingolipids (GSLs) was found in these fungi and isolated from Mucor hiemalis, which is a typical Zygomycetes species. Their structures were completely determined by compositional sugar, fatty acid, and sphingoid analyses, methylation analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. They were as follows: Galβ1-6Galβ1-1Cer (CDS), Galα1-6Galβ1-6Galβ1-1Cer (CTS), Galα1-6Galα1-6Galβ1-6Galβ1-1Cer (CTeS), and Galα1-6Galα1-6Galα1-6Galβ1-6Galβ1-1Cer (CPS). The ceramide moieties of these GSLs consist of 24:0, 25:0, and 26:0 2-hydroxy acids as major fatty acids and 4-hydroxyoctadecasphinganine (phytosphingosine) as the sole sphingoid. However, the glycosylinositolphosphoceramide families that are the major GSLs components in fungi were not detected in Zygomycetes at all. This seems to be the reason that Aureobasidin A is not effective for Zygomycetes as an antifungal agent. Our results indicate that the biosynthetic pathway for GSLs in Zygomycetes is significantly different from those in other fungi and suggest that any inhibitor of this pathway may be effective for mucormycosis, which is a serious pathogenic disease for humans.

Sphingolipids are essential membrane components of both mammalian and fungal cells. The early steps in their biosynthetic pathways up to the formation of sphingosine are the same, but the subsequent pathways are very different in both cells (1Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, sphingosine is attached to fatty acids to yield ceramide. In fungi, phytoceramide is produced from a phytosphingosine having an additional hydroxylation on C-4 and 2-hydroxy fatty acid. The phytoceramide gives rise to inositol-containing sphingolipids such as inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; AbA, Aureobasidin A; Cer, ceramide; CMS, ceramide monosaccharide; CDS, ceramide disaccharide; MS, mass spectroscopy; CTS, ceramide trisaccharide; CTeS, ceramide tetrasaccharide; CPS, ceramide pentasaccharide; Glc, glucose; Gal, galactose; GalCer, galactosylceramide; GSL, glycosphingolipid; MALDI-TOF/MS, matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS; MIPC, mannose-IPC; NGL, neutral GSL; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; AbA, Aureobasidin A; Cer, ceramide; CMS, ceramide monosaccharide; CDS, ceramide disaccharide; MS, mass spectroscopy; CTS, ceramide trisaccharide; CTeS, ceramide tetrasaccharide; CPS, ceramide pentasaccharide; Glc, glucose; Gal, galactose; GalCer, galactosylceramide; GSL, glycosphingolipid; MALDI-TOF/MS, matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS; MIPC, mannose-IPC; NGL, neutral GSL; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography. mannose-IPC (MIPC), and inositol phosphoryl-MIPC (2Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Google Scholar, 3Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274Google Scholar). This step involves the transfer of the phosphoinositol group from phosphatidylinositol to the 1-hydroxy group of the phytoceramide to yield IPC, which is then mannosylated to yield MIPC (4Fischl A.S. Liu Y. Browdy A. Cremesti A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 123-130Google Scholar). Because sphingolipid synthesis is essential for the growth and viability of fungi, it is likely that a blocking of the synthesis would efficiently inhibit cell growth. Therefore, the enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of inositol-containing sphingolipids that are present in fungi but absent in humans have been focused as targets for antifungal agents (5Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Google Scholar). One of these enzymes is IPC synthase, which catalyzes the transfer of the inositolphosphate from phosphatidylinositol to ceramide to give IPC (6Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Google Scholar).Aureobasidin A is well known and widely used as an anti-fungal agent for Eumycetes including yeasts and fungi. It exhibits strong fungicidal activity against many pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus (7Zhong W. Jeffries M.W. Georgopapadakou N.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 651-653Google Scholar, 8Heidler S.A. Radding J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 147-152Google Scholar). Recent studies (6Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Google Scholar) have shown that this antifungal agent inhibits IPC synthase in fungal cells. The inhibition of this enzyme causes the depletion of essential sphingolipids in the fungal cells. Because it is recognized that all fungi have this enzyme, Aureobasidin A is potentially a broad spectrum antifungal (9Takesako K. Kuroda H. Inoue T. Haruna F. Yoshikawa Y. Kato I. Uchida K. Hiratani T. Yamaguchi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1993; 46: 1414-1420Google Scholar).We found that all Zygomycetes species tested were resistant to the antifungal agent Aureobasidin A, a cyclic depsipeptide produced by Aureobasidium pullulans (10Ikai K. Takesako K. Shiomi K. Moriguchi M. Umeda Y. Yamamoto J. Kato I. Naganawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1991; 44: 925-933Google Scholar). The Zygomycetes species do not have inositol-containing sphingolipids but contain novel neutral glycosphingolipids (GSLs) consisting glucose or galactose as sugar constituents. This suggests a remarkable difference in GSLs between Zygomycetes species and other fungi. We supposed that the lack of a synthetic pathway for inositol-containing sphingolipids in their cells might be the cause of the resistance of Zygomycetes species to Aureobasidin A. We also suggested a new synthetic pathway for GSLs containing galactooligosaccharides with Galβ1-6Gal and Galα1-6Gal residues in Zygomycetes species such as Mucor and Rhizopus species. A novel family of neutral GSLs found from Zygomycetes species belongs to a homologous series with a phytoceramide consisting of phytosphingosine and 2-hydroxy C24–C26 fatty acids. This is the first report that Zygomycetes species are resistant to the antifungal agent Aureobasidin A and that they contain a novel family of galactose-containing GSLs but not phosphoinositol-containing sphingolipids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—Fungal strains Aspergillus oryzae (NBRC4075), Aspergillus niger (NBRC31125), Mucor fragilis (NBRC-6449), Mucor racemosus (NBRC4581), Rhizopus oryzae (NBRC9364), Rhizopus microsporus (NBRC30499), Rhizopus stolonifer (NBRC-32998), Rhizomucor pusillus (NBRC9745), Penicillium oxalicum (NBRC5748), and Absidia corymbifera (NBRC32279) were obtained from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation Biological Resource Center. Mucor hiemalis number 314 and Acremonium sp. were isolated from soil and identified in our laboratory (11Kadowaki S. Yamamoto K. Fujisaki M. Izumi K. Tochikura T. Yokoyama T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 97-106Google Scholar, 12Kadowaki S. Ueda T. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 111-120Google Scholar). These strains were cultivated in YPG medium (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% NaCl, 1% glucose, pH 6.5) at 28 °C for 48 h in 2-liter shaking flasks containing 700 ml of the medium on a reciprocal shaker at 120 rpm (12Kadowaki S. Ueda T. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 111-120Google Scholar). For assaying of the growth inhibition by Aureobasidin A (AbA), fungal strains were grown on YPG plates containing 0.1–10 μg/ml AbA for 48 h at 28 °C (13Cheng J. Park T.S. Fischl A.S. Ye X.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6198-6209Google Scholar).Materials—QAE-Sephadex A-25, DEAE Sephadex A-25, and d-[U-14C]glucose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Iatrobeads 6RS-8060 was obtained from Iatron Laboratories Inc. Silica gel 60 precoated plates were from Merck, magnesium silicate (Florisil) was from Nacalai Tesque, green coffee bean α-galactosidase was from Sigma, and jack bean β-galactosidase was from Seikagaku Co. Aureobasidin A was obtained from Takara Bio Inc. All other reagents used were of best grade available commercially.Extraction and Purification of Sphingolipids—Sphingolipids were prepared from mycelia by consecutive extractions, as described elsewhere (14Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were saponified with 0.5 m KOH in methanolwater (95:5, v/v) at 37 °C for 6 h. The hydrolysate was acidified to pH 1.0 with concentrated HCl and then dialyzed against tap water for 2 days followed by concentration and precipitation with acetone. The sphingolipids were fractionated on a QAE-Sephadex A-25 column (20 × 300 mm, OH– form). The neutral fraction was further purified by silica gel chromatography (column, 15 × 600 mm) with a linear gradient elution system of chloroform-methanol-water (400 ml of 90:10:0.5 by volume to 420 ml of 40:60:10 by volume). The polar fraction was then applied to a column of DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (20 × 200 mm, acetate form), as described elsewhere (14Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Google Scholar).Carbohydrate and Fatty Acid Composition Analyses—For determination of the compositions of the fatty acids and sugars in GSLs, 100–200 μg of GSLs were methanolyzed in thick glass test tubes with 200 μl of freshly prepared 1 m anhydrous methanolic HCl using a microwave oven (14Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Google Scholar, 15Itonori S. Takahashi M. Kitamura T. Aoki K. Dulaney J.T. Sugita M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 574-581Google Scholar). After methanolysis, the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted three times with 400 μl of n-hexane and then analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)/MS (14Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Google Scholar, 15Itonori S. Takahashi M. Kitamura T. Aoki K. Dulaney J.T. Sugita M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 574-581Google Scholar). The remaining methanolic phase was evaporated to dryness for deacidification under a nitrogen stream. The residue containing methylglycosides was trimethylsilylated and then analyzed by GLC. Sphingoids prepared from GSLs by methanolysis with 1 m aqueous methanolic HCl at 70 °C for 18 h were converted to their O-trimethylsilyl (N-free) derivatives and then analyzed by GLC/MS (14Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Google Scholar, 15Itonori S. Takahashi M. Kitamura T. Aoki K. Dulaney J.T. Sugita M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 574-581Google Scholar).Methylation for Sugar Linkage Analysis—For determination of the sugar linkages of oligosaccharides in GSLs, 300 μg of a purified GSL was partially methylated with NaOH and CH3I in Me2SO (16Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Google Scholar). The permethylated GSL was acetolyzed and hydrolyzed with 300 μl of a mixture of HCl-water-acetic acid (0.5:1.5:8 by volume.) by exposure to the maximum power of the microwave oven for 1 min and then was reduced with NaBH4 and acetylated with a mixture of acetic anhydridepyridine (1:1, v/v) at 100 °C for 15 min. The partially methylated alditol acetates thus obtained were analyzed by GLC and GLC/MS (14Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Google Scholar, 15Itonori S. Takahashi M. Kitamura T. Aoki K. Dulaney J.T. Sugita M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 574-581Google Scholar).TLC—TLC was performed on silica gel 60 precoated plates with a neutral solvent system, chloroform-methanol-water (60:35:8 and 80: 20:1, by volume). Detection was performed by spraying with orcinol-H2SO4 reagent for sugars, 5% H2SO4-ethanol reagent for organic substances, Dittmer-Lester reagent and Hanes-Isherwood reagent for phosphorus, and ninhydrin reagent for free amino groups.Labeling Studies of GSLs—Fungal cells were grown on YPG liquid medium at 28 °C for 48 h, and then mycelia were collected and washed with distilled water. Mycelia were incubated with 20 μl of [14C]glucose (7.4 MBq/ml) at 28 °C. Incubation was stopped at the appropriate times, and lipids were extracted from the mycelia with a solvent mixture of chloroform-methanol-water (30:30:10, by volume). They were separated by TLC and visualized with an imaging analyzer (Fujifilm, BAS2000).Cleavage of Sugar Linkages by Exoglycosidases—α-Galactosidase from green coffee beans and β-galactosidase from jack beans were used for exoglycosidase cleavage of the sugar linkages of oligosaccharides in GSLs. Samples (10–30 μg) were suspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.5) for α-galactosidase treatment and 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 3.5) for β-galactosidase treatment, respectively, in the presence of 0.1 mg of sodium taurodeoxycholate. Each reaction was carried out with 0.25 units of α-galactosidase and 0.5 units of β-galactosidase, respectively, at 37 °C for 12 h and was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of chloroformmethanol (2:1, v/v). The hydrolysate, after extraction into the lower phase, was dried under a nitrogen stream and then analyzed by TLC.GLC and GLC/MS—A Shimadzu GC-18A gas chromatograph with a capillary column (0.22 mm × 25 m) of Shimadzu HiCap-CBP 5 was used for determination of sugars, aliphatic compositions, and sugar linkages. The following temperature programs were used, 2 °C/min from 140 to 230 °C for sugars, 2 °C/min from 170 to 230 °C for fatty acids, and 2 °C/min from 210 to 230 °C for sphingoids. The partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed with GLC and GLC/MS equipped with a HiCap-CBP 5 capillary column, as described above. Electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP 5050 GLC/MS under the following conditions: oven temperature, 80 °C (2 min) → 180 °C (20 °C/min) → 240 °C (4 °C/min); interface temperature, 250 °C; injection port temperature, 240 °C; helium gas pressure, 100 kilopascal; ionizing voltage, 70 eV (electron impact) and 100 eV (chemical ionization); ionizing current, 60 μA (electron impact) and 200 μA (chemical ionization); and reaction gas (chemical ionization), isobutane.1H NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra of the purified neutral GSLs were obtained with a JEOL A-500 500 MHz 1H NMR spectrometer at 60 °C as the operating temperature. Each purified GSL was dissolved in 0.6 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 containing 2% D2O with the chemical shift being referenced to the solvent signals (δH = 2.49 ppm) in Me2SO-d6 as the internal standard.Matrix-assisted Laser-desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight MS (MALDI-TOF/MS)—MALDI-TOF/MS analyses of the purified neutral GSLs were performed with a Shimadzu/KRATOS KOMPACT MALDI I mass spectrometer equipped with a Work station SPARC station, operating in the positive-ion linear mode (14Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Google Scholar). Ions were formed by a pulsed ultraviolet laser beam (N2 laser, 337 nm; 3-ns wide pulses/s). The matrix used was 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Sigma) (17Dai Y. Whittal R.M. Bridges C.A. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. Li L. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 304: 1-9Google Scholar).RESULTSGrowth of Fungi Resistant to AbA—During studies on GSLs of fungi, we found that all Zygomycetes species examined were resistant to AbA and grew in the medium containing AbA (0.1–10 μg/ml). As shown in Fig. 1A, AbA strongly inhibits the growth of filamentous fungi such as A. oryzae, P. oxalicum, and Acremonium sp., previously reported for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (W303-1A) and other fungi (7Zhong W. Jeffries M.W. Georgopapadakou N.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 651-653Google Scholar, 8Heidler S.A. Radding J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 147-152Google Scholar, 9Takesako K.

However, growth inhibition by AbA was not observed for any Zygomycetes species such as M. hiemalis, R. microsporus, R. pusillus, and A. corymbifera (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the GSLs in Zygomycetes species were very different from those in other fungi. Therefore, we analyzed the GSLs in Zygomycetes species to investigate the AbA resistance mechanism.GSLs of Various Fungi Zygomycetes Species—GSLs of fungi were separated into neutral, acidic, and zwitterionic fractions by ion-exchange column chromatography based on their polarities. Each fraction was analyzed by TLC with a chloroform-methanol-water system. The GSLs of all Zygomycetes species examined were recovered in the neutral fraction but not in the acidic and zwitterionic fractions. In general, acidic GSLs are found in all fungal cells and have been reported to be inositolphosphate-containing sphingolipids such as glycosylinositolphosphoceramides (1Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Google Scholar, 2Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Google Scholar, 3Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274Google Scholar). Surprisingly, they were not found in Zygomycetes species (Fig. 2A), and only neutral GSL (NGLs) being present. A TLC of the NGLs of all Zygomycetes species gave the same pattern but they were apparently different from those of other fungi (Fig. 2B). The NGLs of all Zygomycetes species comprised five components, which were identified to be ceramide mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides (tentatively named as CMS, CDS, CTS, CTeS, and CPS, respectively). On the other hand, for the other fungi, only ceramide monosaccharide was found in the neutral fraction. Then these NSLs of M. hiemalis number 314 were further purified by silica gel column chromatography and confirmed by TLC, as shown in Fig. 2C. The yields were CMS, 20.8 mg; CDS, 6.3 mg; CTS, 16.1 mg; CTeS, 14.0 mg; and CPS, 2.3 mg, respectively. The purified NGLs were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS and quantified by carbohydrate constituent analysis.Fig. 2TLC analyses of glycolipids from various fungi.

The fatty acid composition of CMS comprised of C14h:0 (10.5%) and C16h:0 (89.5%) fatty acids, but CDS–CPS were composed of long chain fatty acids such as C24h:0, C25h:0, and C26h:0. The sphingoid components of CMS were 9-methyl-octadeca-4,8-sphingadienine (d19:2), eicosasphingenine (d20:1), and the unknown (18Fujino Y. Ohnishi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 486: 161-171Google Scholar), whereas those of CDS–CPS were entirely 4-hydroxyoctadecasphinganine (phytosphingosine, t18:0). Because the ceramide compositions of CDS–CPS were entirely the same, these NGLs were supposed to be a series of intermediates of GSL biosynthesis. Such phytoceramides consisting of a 2-hydroxy fatty acid and phytosphingosine are generally found in fungal cells as the major aliphatic component of glycosylinositolphosphoceramides (1Dickson R.C.

Open table in a new tab Structural Characterization of Oligosaccharides of NGLs— The sugar constituents of the purified NGLs were identified by GLC/MS, which revealed the presence of Glc in CMS and only Gal in all the other NGLs. MALDI-TOF/MS spectra of the NGLs showed the presence of pseudomolecular ions [M+H]+ in the positive ion mode, as shown in Fig. 3. They had different pseudomolecular ions because of different ceramide species, which were in agreement with the mass values calculated from the proposed structures; the major [M+H]+ ions of CMS at m/z 698.7 and 726.3 (Fig. 3A) coincided with the mass value of 1 mol each of Glc, fatty acid (2-hydroxy C14:0 or C16:0), and sphingoid (d19:2 or d20:1) (see Table I), those of CDS at m/z 1007.1 and 1035.1 (Fig. 3B) coincided with the mass value of 2 mol of Gal and phytoceramide (t18:0, and 2-hydroxy C24:0 and C26:0), those of CTS at m/z 1169.5 and 1197.4 (Fig. 3C) coincided with the mass value of 3 mol of Gal and phytoceramide (t18:0, and 2-hydroxy C24:0 and C26:0), those of CTeS at m/z 1332.9 and 1361.0 (Fig. 3D) coincided with the mass value of 4 mol of Gal and phytoceramide (t18:0, and 2-hydroxy C24:0 and C26:0), and those of CPS at m/z 1493.5 and 1522.0 (Fig. 3E) coincided with the mass value of 5 mol of Gal and phytoceramide (t18:0, and 2-hydroxy C24:0 and C26:0), respectively.Fig. 3MALDI-TOF/MS spectra of purified GSLs.

The methylation analysis demonstrated the presence of one substituted Glc (1,5-di-(O-acetyl)-2,3,4,6-tetra-(O-methyl)glucitol, 1Glc) for CMS; on the other hand, one substituted Gal (1,5-di-(O-acetyl)-2,3,4,6-tetra-(O-methyl)galactitol, 1Gal) and 1,6 substituted Gal (1,5,6-tri-(O-acetyl)-2,3,4-tri-(O-methyl)galactitol, 1,6Gal) were detected from CDS–CPS. The peak area of 1,6Gal increased depending on the number of Gal residues; the ratio of 1,6Gal to each 1Gal (n = 1.00) in NGLs were 0.92 for CDS, 1.98 for CTS, 3.15 for CTeS, and 4.31 for CPS, respectively. This revealed that the Gal residues of CDS–CPS were linked to the C-6 position of their glycans.Fig. 4Gas chromatograms of partially methylated alditol acetates derived from purified GSLs for determination of glycosidic linkages.

In the anomeric region of the spectrum of each glycolipid, the following anomeric proton resonances were observed: at 4.12 (J = 7.3 Hz) and 4.15 ppm (J = 7.3 Hz) demonstrating 2 mol of β-galactose for CDS (Fig. 5A), at 4.11 (J = 7.3 Hz), 4.16 (J = 7.3 Hz), and 4.69 ppm (J = 3.1 Hz) demonstrating 2 mol of β-galactose and 1 mol of α-galactose for CTS (Fig. 5B), at 4.12 (J = 7.3 Hz), 4.17 (J = 7.3 Hz), 4.70 (J = 3.0 Hz), and 4.72 ppm (J = 3.0 Hz) demonstrating 2 mol of β-galactose and 2 mol of α-galactose for CTeS (Fig. 3C), and at 4.12 (J = 7.3 Hz), 4.18 (J = 7.3 Hz), 4.71 (J = 3.1 Hz, 2H), and 4.72 ppm (J = 3.7 Hz) demonstrating 2 mol of β-galactose and 3 mol of α-galactose for CPS (Fig. 5D), respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the above NGLs with α- and β-galactosidase also revealed the presence of α- and β-galactose residues. As a result, CDS was degraded to ceramide monosaccharide (galactosylceramide (GalCer)) by β-galactosidase, and CTS, CTeS, and CPS were also hydrolyzed to GalCer through the sequential actions of α- and β-galactosidase (data not shown).Fig. 51H NMR spectra of purified GSLs.

This is the first finding of novel glycan chains with Galβ1-6Gal and/or Galα1-6Gal in glycolipids from fungi.Analyses of GSL Synthesis—To investigate the biosynthetic pathway for GSLs, fungal cells were incubated with [14C]glucose, and then lipids extracted from mycelia were analyzed by TLC (Fig. 6). Our preliminary results showed that CMS–CPS were found to be labeled by 14C on incubation within 1 h (Fig. 6A). However, GalCer was not detected on TLC even after incubation for 12 h (Fig. 6B). We supposed that the metabolic process yielding a digalactosylceramide from a phytoceramide might be rapid.Fig. 6TLC analysis of sphingolipid biosynthesis of M. hiemalis. Extracted lipids of M. hiemalis mycelia were analyzed on TLC with different solvent systems of chloroform-methanol-water (A, 60:35:8, by volume; B, 80:20:1, by volume) and visualized with an imaging analyzer. Lanes 1–9, 5-min incubation, 10-min incubation, 15-min incubation, 30-min incubation, 1-h incubation, 2-h incubation, 3-h incubation, 6-h incubation, and 12-h incubation, respectively.

Inhibitors of specific steps of sphingolipid biosynthesis have proven useful for understanding sphingolipid functions, and some of them have been used as fungicidal agents. One of the more useful agents for blocking sphingolipid synthesis in fungi is AbA, which inhibits IPC synthase in fungi cells. As all fungi and plants seem to synthesize IPC as an intermediate of the biosynthetic pathway for GSLs (Scheme 1), AbA exhibits strong fungicidal activity against many pathogenic fungi. However, we found that this agent was not entirely effective for the Zygomycetes species examined. We also found that Zygomycetes species did not have IPC but did have a novel family of n"

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1/dhfr–) cells were transfected with NQO1 cDNA to produce cells that overexpressed NQO1 activity in the nucleus (148-fold) or the cytosol (163-fold) over the constitutive level of the enzyme in parental cells. Subcellular localization of the enzyme was confirmed using antibody-assisted immunofluorescence. Nuclear localization of transfected NQO1 activity increased the cytotoxicity of MC over that produced by overexpression in the cytosol under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions, with greater cytotoxicity being produced under hypoxia. The greater cytotoxicity of nuclear localized NQO1 was not attributable to greater metabolic activation of MC but instead was the result of activation of the drug in close proximity to its target, nuclear DNA. A positive relationship existed between the degree of MC-induced cytotoxicity and the number of MC-DNA adducts produced. The findings indicate that activation of MC proximal to nuclear DNA by the nuclear localization of transfected NQO1 increases the cytotoxic effects of MC regardless of the degree of oxygenation and support the concept that the mechanism of action of MC involves alkylation of DNA.

Marumo H. Tomioka K. Shimizu G. Kato E. Kamada H. Kudo S. Fujimoto Y. Antibiot. Chemother. 1958; 8: 228-240Google Scholar). MC exhibits a broad spectrum of antitumor activity and is an important component in the combination chemotherapy of malignancies such as early stage head and neck cancer, early stage cervical cancer, and intravesicle therapy of superficial bladder cancer. Specific MC-DNA lesions associated with the action of MC consist of both monofunctional and bifunctional alkylations (2Tomasz M. Lipman R. Chowdary D. Pawlak J. Verdine G.L. Nakanishi K.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1517-1529Google Scholar). Monoalkylations initially occur through the linkage of the C-1 position of MC to the amino function in the 2-position of guanine bases in DNA and may proceed to a DNA cross-link through the C-10 position of MC to an amino entity in the 2-position of an adjacent DNA guanine (6Tomasz M. Palom Y. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 76: 73-87Google Scholar). Although monoalkylations are potentially cytotoxic, compelling evidence in both bacterial and mammalian systems implicates MC-induced cross-links as the primary event responsible for cell death (10Iyer V. Szybalski W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 355-361Google Scholar, 11Iyer V. Szybalski W. Science. 1964; 145: 55-58Google Scholar, 12Keyes S.R. Loomis R. DiGiovanna M.P. Pritsos C.A. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 351-356Google Scholar). A salient feature of the molecular mechanism of action of MC is that this agent exists as a prodrug, and both its DNA cross-linking and monoalkylating activities require the reduction of the quinone ring to a hydroquinone, which transforms MC into a highly reactive alkylating species (11Iyer V. Szybalski W. Science. 1964; 145: 55-58Google Scholar). Enzymes known to activate MC to intermediates capable of alkylating DNA do so either by a one- or a two-electron reduction mechanism. One-electron reducing enzymes include NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (NPR; EC 1.6.2.4) (13Komiyama T. Oki T. Inui T. J. Pharm. Dyn. 1979; 2: 407-410Google Scholar, 14Bachur N.R. Gordon S.L.

Life Sci. 2001; 68: 1677-1685Google Scholar). One-electron reducing enzymes activate MC to a semiquinone anion radical, which is oxygen-sensitive. It is this property that leads to the preferential kill of hypoxic cells by MC. Thus, under aerobic conditions, the semiquinone anion radical reacts rapidly with molecular oxygen at a near diffusion-limited rate to regenerate the parent prodrug, MC (21Penketh P.G. Hodnick W.F. Belcourt M.F. Shyam K. Sherman D.H. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34445-34452Google Scholar). However, under hypoxic conditions, the semiquinone is a longer lived species and participates in a disproportionation reaction to produce the MC hydroquinone (MCH2) intermediate, which leads to the cross-linking of DNA (5Suresh Kumar G. Lipman R. Cummings J. Tomasz M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14128-14136Google Scholar). Two-electron reducing enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1; DT-diaphorase; EC 1.6.99.2) (22Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D.

Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1180-1185Google Scholar, 26Pritsos C.A. Gustafson D.L. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 477-481Google Scholar) activate MC directly through a single step to produce MCH2. The difference in the production of these two reactive species, MCH2 and MC semiquinone anion radical, gives rise to the difference in the survival curves that are observed for cells treated with MC under aerobic and hypoxic conditions. This separation, known as the “aerobic/hypoxic differential,” is reflected in the cytotoxicity profiles for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants overexpressing NPR (27Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 456-460Google Scholar) and NBR (28Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Google Scholar, 29Holtz K.M. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5029-5034Google Scholar) but not for those overexpressing NQO1 (30Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1669-1678Google Scholar). Thus, although NPR and NBR are not important enzymes in the activation of MC under aerobic conditions, they contribute to the preferential activation of MC in hypoxia. Bioactivation of MC by NQO1, a two-electron donating enzyme, directly generates MCH2; therefore, NQO1 contributes to the cytotoxicity of MC under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. A number of factors are involved in modulating the therapeutic efficacy of MC. These include the levels of the individual reductase enzymes and the cofactors, NADH and NADPH; the extent of formation of the exceedingly cytotoxic DNA cross-link; and the damaging oxygen radicals, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and/or hydroxyl radical that are formed by redox cycling reactions. Reductive activation of the MC present in the cytosol in air to form the highly reactive electrophile MCH2 minimizes the formation of the exceedingly lethal DNA cross-links, since MCH2 reacts with a variety of cellular nucleophiles, including water, during its diffusion into the nucleus and reaction with DNA. Thus, activation of MC in the nucleus close to the DNA target should result in a greater number of DNA cross-links and increased cell kill. Such a prediction was realized in studies with CHO cells transfected with a cDNA encoding rat NBR, in that nuclear localization of the enzyme resulted in greater cell kill and increased numbers of MC-DNA adducts over those occurring with overexpressed NBR localized predominantly in its normal mitochondrial and endoplasmic recticulum locations (29Holtz K.M. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5029-5034Google Scholar). Since NQO1, being a two-electron reducing system that directly generates MCH2 (4Gargiulo D. Suresh Kumar G.

Plasmid Construction—The cDNA mammalian expression constructs of nuclear localized NQO1 (NLS-NQO1) and cytoplasmic localized NQO1 (CYTO-NQO1) were prepared by PCR using a plasmid encoding the cDNA for the rat NQO1 gene (30Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1669-1678Google Scholar) as the template. To create the NLS-NQO1, the NQO1 gene was modified by PCR using the following upstream oligonucleotide primer: 5′-CGC GGA GCT AGC CCG GTG AGA AGA GCC CTG ATT GTA-3′. This oligonucleotide featured the sequences for a unique NheI site (shown above in italics) upstream of the coding sequences for rat NQO1 truncated to remove the start codon. The NheI site was used to fuse NQO1 in frame behind the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 large T antigen (36Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar, 37Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Google Scholar, 38Vancurova I. Jochova J. Lou W. Paine P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 529-536Google Scholar) in the pRC-CMV plasmid (Invitrogen). The 3′-end of the gene was modified to include the sequences for the 15 amino acids of the muscle actin epitope (highlighted below by the double underline) (39McHugh K.M. Lessard J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4167Google Scholar), which is recognizable by the HUC 1-1 monoclonal antibody (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), followed by a unique XbaI site (represented in italics) in succession with the complementary sequences for NQO1 (shown by the single underline) using the following down-stream oligonucleotide primer: 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCT AGA CTA AAT ACT TGG CCC TTC ATC ATA TTC TTG TTT GGA TAT CCA CATCCC TCT AGC TTT GAT CTG GTT ATC GGC-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned in frame behind the sequence for the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 large T antigen residing in the mammalian expression vector, pRC-CMV (Invitrogen), created for these studies. The CYTO-NQO1 plasmid was prepared to include a HindIII site (represented below in italics) and a Kozak sequence (highlighted by the double underline) upstream of the NQO1 coding sequence (highlighted by a single underline) using the following upstream oligonucleotide primer: CYTO-NQO1 forward, 5′-CGC GGA AAG CTT ACC GCCATG GCG GTG AGA AGA GCC CTG ATT GTA TTG 3′. The reverse primer for the muscle actin epitope was identical to the one employed for the creation of the NLS-NQO1. This gene product was unidirectionally subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI polylinker sites of the mammalian expression vector, pRC-CMV (Invitrogen). Both of these plasmids, which insert stably into the genome of transfected cell lines, contain the appropriate sequences for polyadenylation and selection by G418 (neomycin resistance). In the case of NLS-NQO1, the plasmid also contains the sequence for the nuclear localization signal from the SV40 large T antigen. Expression of both NLS-NQO1 and CYTO-NQO1 fusion constructs were driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter to produce fusion proteins. Cell Culture—The cell line used in this study is the dihydrofolate-deficient variant of the CHO-K1 cell line called CHO-K1/dhfr– (40Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Google Scholar) and was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 0.01 mm thymidine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Transfected cell lines were maintained in identical medium in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen) to provide a positive selection pressure for the expression vector. Cells were grown and treated as monolayers in a variety of cell culture vessels in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfections—CHO-K1/dhfr– cells were transfected with either NLS-NQO1 or CYTO-NQO1 constructs using calcium phosphate methodology essentially as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells containing NLS-NQO1 or CYTO-NQO1 were selected using G418, and individual positive populations were expanded and screened for NQO1 activity. Cell populations with elevated enzyme activity were subjected to single cell sorting by flow cytometry and expanded. Expanded clones were rescreened and selected for high levels of NQO1 activity and basal levels of NPR and NBR activities. Relatively matched clones with respect to NQO1 activity were selected for study. Enzyme Activity Assays—Monolayers of exponentially growing cells incubated under aerobic (95% air and 5% CO2) conditions were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by sonication, and NQO1 activity was measured essentially as described by Ernster (41Ernster L.

NQO1 activity inhibitable by dicumarol (Sigma) was quantified by measuring the reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol (Sigma) at 600 nm with a Beckman model 25 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA); activities were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm–1 cm–1 at 30 °C. NPR activity was quantified by the reduction of ferricytochrome c measured at 550 nm at 30 °C; activities were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm–1 cm–1 at 30 °C (42Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Google Scholar). NBR activity was quantified as NADH:ferricyanide reductase measured at 420 nm at 30 °C; activities were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1.02 mm–1 cm–1 at 30 °C (32Yubisui T. Takeshita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1467-1477Google Scholar) using a final concentration of 0.34 mm NADH. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) (43Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded at 1000 cells/well on a poly-d-lysine-treated 8-chambered glass slide (BD Falcon, Boston, MA). Twenty-four h later, the cells were fixed in 20% formaldehyde for 15 min and were permeabilized with ice-cold acetone for 5 min. Samples were incubated with primary antibody, anti-muscle actin (HUC 1-1) monoclonal antibody (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) to the muscle actin epitope at a 1:120 dilution, washed, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody at a 1:128 dilution (Sigma). Each incubation was performed at 4 °C for 18 h. The samples were then treated with 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 9.0, and examined using a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped with a Nikon Episcopic-Fluorescence attachment EF-D and a Nikon UFX-IIA MicroFlex Camera. Aerobic and Hypoxic Cell Survival Experiments—Cells were seeded in glass milk dilution bottles at 2.5 × 105 cells/bottle and grown for 3 days in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Hypoxia was established by gassing the cultures with a humidified mixture of 95% N2 plus 5% CO2 (containing <10 ppm O2) (AirGas, Cheshire, CT) at 37 °C for 2 h through a rubber septum fitted with 13-gauge (inflow) and 18-gauge (outflow) needles. MC at 2.5, 5.0, 10, 12.5, and 15 μm was then introduced into the cultures using a Hamilton syringe without compromising the hypoxic environment, and cultures were incubated for 1 h. Cells under aerobic conditions were treated identically but gassed with a humidified atmosphere of 95% air plus 5% CO2. MC-treated cells were then washed, harvested by trypsinization, and assayed for survival using a clonogenic assay (27Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 456-460Google Scholar). Macroscopic colonies consisting of more than 40 cells were counted, and the plating efficiencies, defined as the number of macroscopic colonies counted divided by the number of cells plated, was determined. The surviving fractions were calculated by normalizing the plating efficiencies of the drug-treated groups to those of the vehicle-treated control groups. MC Metabolic Studies—Suspension cultures were treated with 12.5 μm MC under aerobic (1 × 108 cells/ml) or hypoxic (5.0 × 106 cells/ml) conditions as described above. Cell suspensions (0.75 ml) were collected at various times (0–4 h) and mixed with an equal part of acetonitrile. The contents of the acetonitrile phase were separated on 5-μm, 220 × 4.6-mm C-18 reverse phase columns (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by elution with a 3–27% acetonitrile gradient in 0.03 m KH2PO4 (pH 5.4) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 360 nm using a Beckman 168 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Untransformed MC was eluted as a single peak at ∼25 min. Areas under the curve, calculated using Beckman Ultima Gold software, directly corresponded to the concentration of untransformed MC in the sample. Thus, the conversion of MC to the reactive MCH2 species was calculated by quantifying the amount of remaining MC. Total [3H]MC-DNA Adducts—Exponentially growing cells were collected by trypsinization and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Aerobic and hypoxic conditions were identical to those established for the MC metabolism studies described above. Cells were treated with 12.5 μm [3H]MC (0.18 mCi/μmol; donated by Kyowa Hakkao Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 2 h. Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 × 107 cells using the PURGENE DNA purification system (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were lysed and treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K overnight followed by 20 μg/ml RNase A for 2 h at 37 °C. Isolated DNA was washed two times with 70% ethanol to remove noncovalently bound [3H]MC, and the DNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). An aliquot was used to quantify the number of [3H]MC-DNA adducts using a Beckman scintillation spectrometer, and the DNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at A260 nm. Radioactivity in the sample was normalized to the total DNA concentration. Isolation of Stable CHO Cell Line Transfectants Overexpressing NQO1—To examine the effects of the overexpression of NQO1 activity in different subcellular compartments on the sensitivity of aerobic and hypoxic cells to MC, clonal populations of CHO cells were isolated and assayed for NQO1 activity. Clones that exhibited high levels of NQO1 activity relative to parental CHO cells, with no significant differences in the levels of expression of both NBR and NPR were chosen for these studies; the enzymatic activity profiles for NLS-NQO1, CYTO-NQO1, and parental CHO cells are summarized in Table I. CYTO-NQO1 and NLS-NQO1 CHO-K1/dhfr– cell transfectants that expressed significantly more NQO1 activity (163-fold and 148-fold, respectively) than parental CHO cells were isolated. This level of overexpression in transfected CHO-K1/dhfr– cells is roughly comparable with previously reported increases in NQO1 activity of 126- and 133-fold over parental CHO cells (30Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1669-1678Google Scholar) and is markedly higher than the increase in expression obtained for cells transfected with the one-electron bioreductive enzyme systems NPR (44Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 111-133Google Scholar, 45Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 599Google Scholar) and NBR (28Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Google Scholar, 29Holtz K.M. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5029-5034Google Scholar). No significant changes occurred in the NBR and NPR activities of the CYTO-NQO1 and NLS-NQO1 CHO-K1/dhfr– transfectants and parental cells. Xanthine:oxygen oxidoreductase and xanthine:NAD+ oxidoreductase activities were not measured, since CHO-K1/dhfr– cells do not show detectable levels of these enzymes (27Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 456-460Google Scholar). Additionally, measurements of cellular growth indicated that CHO-K1/dhfr– transfectants and parental cells had comparable growth rates (data not shown).Table IOxidoreductase activities of CHO-K1/dhfr– parental cells and NQO1-transfected cell lines overexpressing either cytoplasmic (CYTO-NQO1) or nuclear (NLS-NQO1) rat NQO1 cDNACell lineEnzyme activityNQO1NBRNPRnmol/min/mg proteinaEnzyme activities in cell sonicates were determined spectrophotometrically as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values shown are the means of three determinations ± S.E.Parental5.2 ± 1.21050 ± 19016.2 ± 1.7NLS-NQO1771 ± 30bValues are significantly different from parental cells (p < 0.0001).1113 ± 6515.5 ± 1.8CYTO-NQO1850 ± 63cValues are significantly different from parental cells (p < 0.0002).996 ± 6614.0 ± 0.7a Enzyme activities in cell sonicates were determined spectrophotometrically as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values shown are the means of three determinations ± S.E.b Values are significantly different from parental cells (p < 0.0001).c Values are significantly different from parental cells (p < 0.0002). Open table in a new tab Subcellular Distribution of Overexpressed NQO1 Activity in CHO-K1/dhfr– Parental, CYTO-NQO1, and NLS-NQO1 Cells— To ensure that the nuclear localization signal included in the fusion construct of NLS-NQO1 directed the overexpressed enzyme to the nucleus, NQO1 was visually assessed by indirect immunofluorescence techniques in NLS-NQO1, CYTO-NQO1, and parental CHO-K1/dhfr– cells (Fig. 1). Since both the CYTO-NQO1 and NLS-NQO1 fusion proteins are epitope-tagged, the use of antibody-directed immunofluorescence resulted in visualization of only the fusion protein and not the endogenous NQO1 protein. Staining with the HUC1-1 monoclonal antibody for the epitope tag revealed intense nuclear staining in the overexpressing NLS-NQO1 cells, indicating that nuclear localization of NQO1 was achieved (Fig. 1A). In contrast, CYTO-NQO1 cells demonstrated intense staining, which was predominantly cytoplasmic, with minimal nuclear staining (Fig. 1B). As expected, parental cells exhibited minimal fluorescence staining, since the HUC1-1 antibody specifically recognized the fusion protein expressed by the transfectants (Fig. 1C). Effects of MC under Aerobic and Hypoxic Conditions on the Survival of Stable CHO Cell Transfectants Overexpressing NQO1 in the Cytosol or the Nucleus—The effects of overexpression of NQO1 activity, either in the cytosol (Fig. 2A) or nucleus (Fig. 2B), on the cytotoxicity of MC under aerobic and hypoxic conditions were measured by comparing the survival curves for the CHO transfectants with that of parental cells. In the parental cell line, greater levels of cell kill were obtained in hypoxia than under aerobic conditions, a finding consistent with previous reports (27Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 456-460Google Scholar, 29Holtz K.M. Rockwell S. Tomasz M. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5029-5034Google Scholar, 30Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1669-1678Google Scholar). Comparative survival curves for CHO-K1/dhfr– parental and CYTO-NQO1 transfectants (Fig. 2A) and CYTO-NQO1 and NLS-NQO1 transfectants (Fig. 2B) exposed to MC under aerobic and hypoxic conditions are shown. Overexpression of cytosolic localizing NQO1 activity in CHO cells resulted in a significant increase in the cytotoxicity of MC relative to parental cells at concentrations of MC of 2.5–10 μm under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, a highly significant increase in MC-induced toxicity was observed in cells that overexpressed NQO1 activity in the nucleus over those overexpressing NQO1 activity in the cytosol under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions at a concentration of 10 μm MC (Fig. 2B). Exposure of CHO-K1/dhfr– parental, CYTO-NQO1, and NLS-NQO1 cells to higher concentrations of MC in the range of 10–15 μm clearly demonstrated that overexpression of NQO1 in either the cytosol or nucleus increased cell kill under both aerobic (Fig. 3A) and hypoxic (Fig. 3B) conditions, with nuclear localization of the enzyme activity decreasing cell survival more than cytosolic localization, although cytosolic overexpression of NQO1 activity was increased by 163-fold, whereas nuclear overexpression was increased somewhat less by 148-fold.Fig. 3Survival curves for CHO-K1/dhfr– parental, CYTO-NQO1 transfectant, and NLS-NQO1 transfectant cells exposed to 10–15 μm MC for 1 h under aerobic (A, solid symbols) and hypoxic (B, open symbols) conditions. Parental (•, ○), CYTO-NQO1 (▪, □), and NLS-NQO1 (▴, ▵) cells were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Surviving fractions were calculated using the plating efficiencies of aerobic and hypoxic vehicle-treated controls.

https://openalex.org/W2047684232,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are an extensive class of multidomain Ca2+-regulated enzymes from plants and protozoa. In vivo the so-called calmodulin-like domain (CLD) of CDPK binds intramolecularly to the junction domain (JD), which exhibits both kinase-inhibitory and CLD binding properties. Here we report the high resolution solution structure of the calcium-regulatory region from soybean CDPK-α determined in the presence of a peptide encompassing the JD. The structure of both lobes of CLD resembles that of related helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding proteins. NMR chemical shift mapping studies demonstrate that the JD induces significant structural changes in isolated Ca2+-CLD, particularly the C-terminal domain, although a stable complex is not formed. A CLD solution structure calculated on the basis of NMR data and long range fluorescence resonance energy transfer distances reveals an activated state with both lobes positioned side by side, similar to calcineurin B rather than calmodulin, highlighting the possible pitfall of assigning function purely from sequence information.

Ca2+ signaling in plants underlies a necessity for a measured response to numerous biotic and abiotic stimuli such as drought, light, touch, and hormones (1Sanders D. Pelloux J. Brownlee C.

Kudla J. Rodriguez-Concepcion M. Yalovsky S. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S389-S400Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) as well as calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), which are calmodulin-independent (5Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 6Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). CDPKs are sensor proteins that are capable of decoding calcium signals, and they have recently been directly implicated in the plant defense response (7Romeis T. Ludwig A.A. Martin R. Jones J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). They have also been shown in vitro to be involved with a myriad of metabolic, transport, stress, and cytoskeletal cell pathways (5Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar).The primary sequence of CDPKs provides some insight as to the mode of calcium response as demonstrated for soybean CDPK-α in Fig. 1. Sandwiched between the kinase domain and the calmodulin-like domain (CLD) is a junction domain (JD). Calcium response is imparted by the CLD, which shares significant amino acid sequence homology to CaM (>40% identity for soybean CDPK-α with vertebrate CaM), hence the namesake of this region. The JD has been shown to posses both autoinhibitory (8Harper J.F. Huang J.F. Lloyd S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7267-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9Harmon A.C. Yoo B.C.

This has led to the hypothesis that the mechanism of interaction is the same as that of CaM/CaMKs as would be implied by the evolutionary origin of the CDPK gene (12Zhang X.S. Choi J.H. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Gubrium E. Harper J.F. New Phytologist. 2001; 151: 175-183Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and comparative modeling studies (14Weljie A.M. Clarke T.E. Juffer A.H. Harmon A.C. Vogel H.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).However, work characterizing the “tether” region between the JD and CLD of Arabidopsis CPK-1 indicates that the structural features of CDPK are considerably more complex than a simple analogy to CaM/CaMKs (15Vitart V.V. Christodoulou J. Huang J.F. Chazin W.J. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In the case of soybean CDPK-α, bimolecular studies of a truncation mutant of the protein with the kinase domain, JD, and only the first two calcium-binding loops of the CLD cannot be activated intermolecularly by CaM, but significant activity is achieved with exogenous CLD (10Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12029-12037Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the two domains of CLD are not independent and that the N- and C-lobes have an important role in binding. Furthermore NMR diffusion (16Weljie A.M. Yamniuk A.P. Yoshino H. Izumi Y. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) distance (17Weljie A.M. Robertson K.M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43764-43769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) data demonstrate that the CLD shows significant compaction in the presence of Ca2+ as compared with the apoform, which is markedly different from CaM in which the two lobes remain independent in both the Ca2+ and apoforms.Since structural and mechanistic understanding of CDPKs has thus far been limited to biochemical characterization, we were intrigued by the functional differences between the CLD and CaM and decided to examine the structural features of the calcium-regulatory region of soybean CDPK-α. We report here the solution structure of the CLD in the presence of Ca2+ and a synthetic JD peptide. Based on these data, we provide a fresh interpretation of studies that have presented speculative arguments vis à vis the relative role of the two domains of CLD. Finally, given the high degree of identity of CDPKs with the CaM/CaMK system and the strikingly different behavior of this system, it is instructive to examine the implications of this study in a broader context in relation to potential pitfalls in “structural genomic” approaches to protein structure analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein and Peptides—The gene for CLD from soybean CDPK-α (residues Ala329–Lys508) was a kind gift from Dr. A. C. Harmon (University of Florida). The CLD gene was PCR-amplified out of the original pET-3b construct and cloned into the pT7-7 vector, and a His6 tag was inserted immediately C-terminal to the protein-expressing sequence to avoid purifying proteins subject to proteolytic cleavage as reported previously (10Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12029-12037Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring this construct were used as hosts for protein expression. 15N-Labeled CLD was expressed using a MOPS-based minimal medium as described previously (18Kohno T. Kusunoki H. Sato K. Wakamatsu K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and 15N/13C-labeled CLD was expressed using Bio-Express minimal medium (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8) and applied to nickel-loaded metal chelation chromatography resin (Amersham Biosciences). Wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8) was applied until the A280 of the flow-through stabilized. Elution buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8) was added, and the protein was collected for further purification. Subsequently calcium-dependent hydrophobic chromatography was carried out using Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (14Weljie A.M. Clarke T.E. Juffer A.H. Harmon A.C. Vogel H.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purity was >98% as assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein samples were desalted into a 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution using a PD-10 column (Bio-Rad) and subsequently lyophilized and stored at –20 °C prior to being used in NMR experiments. Unlabeled peptide encompassing the CLD-binding portion of the junction domain of soybean CDPK-α and an N-terminal Cys (Ac-CAV LSR LKQ FSA XNK LKK MAL RVI A-NH2 where X = norleucine) were synthesized by the peptide synthesis facility, Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada, headed by Dr. Gilles Lajoie.NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for NMR experiments were prepared in a 90% H2O, 10% D2O bufferless solution, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. pH was adjusted with KOD and DCl, and the final pH was not adjusted for isotope effects. 15N samples used for Ca2+ and initial JD-CLD titrations were 150–200 μm in a 500-μl volume, and the final sample used for resonance assignment of Ca2+-CLD was 1 mm in protein. The JD-CLD 15N/13C sample used for assignment and structural determination was ∼1 mm in protein and 1.2 mm in JD peptide in 350 μl. 1H/15N/13C backbone resonance assignments of the CLD in the JD-CLD sample were accomplished with standard triple resonance experiments (19Ferentz A.E.

All spectra were referenced with respect to a 1H chemical shift of 0 ppm for the most upfield resonance of 5,5-dimethylsilapentanesulfonate. Residual dipolar coupling data were obtained from the same sample diluted to 500 μl with the inclusion of a pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether/1-hexanol-based detergent system (5%, r = 0.89) as described previously (21Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar) using an in-phase-antiphase 1H,15N HSQC pulse program on a Bruker Avance DRX 700 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm TBI probe with triple axis gradients. Measurements in the liquid crystalline phase were acquired at 36 °C, and measurements in the isotropic phase were acquired at 39 °C. All data were processed with NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11376) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (23Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol.

Other non-Gly residues without these constraints were limited to dihedral angles of –35° to –175° based on accepted geometry. The simulated annealing protocol was initiated from a fully extended conformation.The default parameters were used for ARIA with the exception that the “qmove” flag was set to on. This flag forces initially violated restraints to be reset to very weak restraints and reassessed for validity within the calibration; this was necessary due to the high degree of resonance broadening in the sample. In the final two iterations, 100 structures were calculated, and the lowest energy 15 were selected for the structure ensembles. The final ensemble was evaluated using AQUA 3.2 and PROCHECK 3.5 (31Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

Initial 1H,15N HSQC correlation spectra of both Ca2+-saturated CLD (Ca2+-CLD) and Ca2+-CLD with JD peptide encompassing residues 301–329 of soybean CDPK-α peptide added (JD-CLD) demonstrated reasonable peak dispersion indicative of a folded protein (data not shown). There was, however, significant variation in peak intensities (Fig. 2A for JD-CLD) and fewer than the expected 180 resonances suggesting complex conformational behavior with many broad peaks and some split into multiple dispersive resonances, such as resonances 369 and 477 in Fig. 1, B and C. This appears to be characteristic of CDPKs as complete resonance assignment of the regulatory region of an Arabidopsis isoform (inhibitory and calcium-binding regions together in the same construct) required low pH and significantly elevated temperatures to overcome resonance broadening (32Christodoulou J. Hu H. Chung J. Rance M. Harper J.F. Chazin W.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 249-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Significant chemical shift differences were noted between the Ca2+-CLD and Ca2+-saturated JD-CLD spectra due to the presence of the JD peptide (Fig. 2C) as discussed below. Structure determination proceeded with the JD-CLD spectra where residues from the C-terminal lobe of the CLD were generally better defined (i.e. more intense and less broad than in the Ca2+-CLD sample), although the N- and C-terminal domains still demonstrated significantly different chemical properties. For example, the backbone resonances were generally broader and less intense in the C-terminal domain in both the 1H-15N HSQC correlation spectra (Fig. 2A) and 13C/15N-edited NOESY spectra (not shown), and these C-domain correlation peaks also demonstrated a greater distribution of 15N-{1H} NOE values (Fig. 2B). Interestingly in both domains the peak intensity was highest near the loop regions of the helix-loop-helix metal-binding sites, but in the N-terminal domain the 15N-{1H} NOE values were fairly constant, suggesting the difference in intensity is not caused by differential flexibility.Fig. 2Differential conformational behavior of the N- and C-domains of Ca2+-saturated JD-CLD.A, maximum peak intensities from the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of JD-CLD for each resonance. Note the substantial difference between different regions of the protein with the most intense peaks from both domains occurring in the loops of the calcium-binding regions. The variation in intensity is indicative of resonance broadening probably due to chemical exchange phenomenon. B, 15N-{1H} NOE of the resonances from JD-CLD. Note the much larger dispersion of values in the C-terminal domain compared with the N-terminal domain. C, chemical shift perturbation when JD peptide is added to Ca2+-CLD to give rise to Ca2+-saturated JD-CLD. The majority of significant chemical shift changes are localized to the interdomain linker and C-terminal domain, although resides 398 and 401 in the terminal D helix of the N-terminal domain also show significant changes. The changes to the C-terminal domain extend further than the putative JD-binding region as described in the text and as shown in Fig. 3C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Essentially complete chemical shift assignments were obtained for residues in the Ca2+-binding loops as well as the linkers between calcium-binding loops 1 and 2 (N-terminal domain) and loops 3 and 4 (C-terminal domain). Partial assignments were obtained for residues Ala329–Glu335 (tether region at the N terminus of the CLD), Lys405–Leu412, the linker between the two domains, and Arg485–Leu496, a stretch of the C-terminal tail. The 14 extreme C-terminal tail residues that were assigned showed very narrow line widths, representative of rapid motions, presumably due to a flexible random coil conformation. No significant structural NOEs were observed for this region, and hence only residues Ala329–Arg485 were included in the structural calculation.The structures of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of CLD conform to bilobal EF-hand proteins with a canonical helix-loop-helix structure for the two calcium-binding loops in each domain and a small β sheet region connecting the pairs (Fig. 3A). When the core regions of the N- and C-terminal domains of the calcium-regulatory region are overlaid independently, they are well defined (backbone r.m.s.d. values of 0.780 and 0.604 Å, respectively, Table I). A significant number of long range NOEs, particularly from the 13C-edited NOESY, define the hydrophobic centers in each domain. The relative spatial positioning of the two domains with respect to each other is discussed below. Table I provides summary statistical information for the family of 15 lowest energy structures from the ARIA calculations. In the N-terminal domain, these hydrophobic cores are flanked by interhelical contacts between helices A/B, A/D, B/C, and C/D (helices as defined in Fig. 1A). Correspondingly, in the C-terminal domain, a similar pattern of helical interaction is seen with contacts between helices E/F, E/H, F/G, and G/H.Fig. 3A, ensemble of the 15 lowest energy structures for the N-terminal domain (backbone r.m.s.d., 0.78 Å) and C-terminal domain (backbone r.m.s.d., 0.60 Å) of the Ca2+-saturated JD-CLD molecule. The disordered region in red is the tether region immediately N-terminal (N-term) to the well ordered region, and in intact CDPK, the JD is attached directly N-terminal to this region. Analogously the green C-terminal (C-term) tail is disordered, although several contacts are made between the C-terminal domain and the C-terminal tail. B, stereo ribbon diagram of the open conformation of Ca2+-saturated JD-CLD where the two domains are adjacently positioned forming an open surface. C, chemical shift mapping changes between the Ca2+-CLD form and Ca2+-saturated JD-CLD form of the N- and C-terminal domains. Changes in the chemical shift are marked for amide 1H,15N changes of <50 Hz (blue), 50–100 Hz (cyan), 100–150 Hz (yellow), and >150 Hz (red) as described in the text.

Open table in a new tab The interhelical angles in the helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding loops (Table II) are all slightly more closed than a perpendicular value of 90°. The most closed is the first A/B EF-hand at 116 ± 4°, while the C/D, D/E, and E/F helix angles show very similar values of 103 ± 6, 103 ± 4, and 102 ± 4°, respectively. These helical angles result in pockets of hydrophobic surface area being exposed in both domains. Residues Leu340, Leu343, Leu364, Leu371, Leu378, Thr399, Leu402, and to a lesser extent Ile437, Ile390, and Phe395 contribute to a significant pocket in the N-terminal domain. In the C-terminal domain, major contributions come from Tyr418, Phe419, Phe436, Phe439, Leu441, Ile444, Met469, and Met470, and minor contributions come from Ile453 and Phe466. It is worth noting that the Met residues of the N-terminal domain (residues 346, 372, and 380) are all located on the outside surface or interior of the lobe and do not contribute to the binding area in contrast to previous modeling predictions (14Weljie A.M.

Open table in a new tab The hydrophobic pockets in both domains are lined by a significant number of charged residues. In the N-terminal domain, the side chains of Glu370, Glu375, and Asp378 form a cluster of negative charge. The C-terminal lobe does not show a similar pattern of clustering with only Asp438 and His444 protruding significantly into the hydrophobic pocket, while Asp448 and Glu452 are situated at the periphery. It is interesting to note that the region between Asp441 and Asp448 show extensive line broadening, and those resonance that were assigned were of low intensity in the NMR spectra (Fig. 2A) and had a lower than average number of NOE-based distance restraints, indicative of flexibility or chemical exchange, consistent with the notion that this region is directly involved with binding the JD peptide. While 15N-{1H} NOE values were not obtained for this region due to low signal to noise and extensive broadening, the resonances for the regions surrounding this region show relatively low values indicative of flexibility (Fig. 2B). There is also a clustering of basic residues, Arg471, Lys472, Arg473, and Lys474, near the end of the C-terminal lobe. In general the residues lining the putative binding pocket from the linker region and the C-terminal domain show a similar pattern of very low signal to noise in the 15N-{1H}-NOE experiment with flexibility in the surrounding residues (Fig. 2B).An Unexpected Structural Basis for the JD-CLD Interaction—Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the JD-CLD structure is the relative position of the N- and C-terminal domains. Unambiguous interdomain NOEs were observed between the methyl and amide protons of Ala382 (helix C) and the δ and ϵ ring protons of Tyr418 (helix E). The latter residue also showed sterically unambiguous contacts with the side chain of Lys377 (also helix C). This corresponds roughly to the ends of helix C and the beginning of helix E (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the observed interdomain NOEs was very weak presumably because the resonances for the residues involved, especially Ala382, exhibited several distinct conformers. Nevertheless the interaction between the two lobes is primarily comprised of a hydrophobic interaction with Tyr418 forming the primary bridge."
https://openalex.org/W2066276083,"Glacontryphan-M, a novel calcium-dependent inhibitor of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels expressed in mouse pancreatic β-cells, was recently isolated from the venom of the cone snail Conus marmoreus (Hansson, K., Ma, X., Eliasson, L., Czerwiec, E., Furie, B., Furie, B. C., Rorsman, P., and Stenflo, J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 32453–32463). The conserved disulfide-bonded loop of the contryphan family of conotoxins including a d-Trp is present; however, unique to glacontryphan-M is a histidine within the intercysteine-loop and two γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues, formed by post-translational modification of glutamic acid. The two calcium-binding Gla residues are located in a four residue N-terminal extension of this contryphan. To better understand the structural and functional significance of these residues, we have determined the structure of glacontryphan-M using two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy in the absence and presence of calcium. Comparisons of the glacontryphan-M structures reveal that calcium binding induces structural perturbations within the Gla-containing N terminus and the Cys11-Cys5-Pro6 region of the intercysteine loop. The backbone of N-terminal residues perturbed by calcium, Gla2 and Ser3, moves away from the His8 and Trp10 aromatic rings and the alignment of the d-Trp7 and His8 aromatic rings with respect to the Trp10 rings is altered. The blockage of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel currents by glacontryphan-M requires calcium binding to N-terminal Gla residues, where presumably histidine and tryptophan may be accessible for interaction with the channel. The backbone Cα conformation of the intercysteine loop of calcium-bound glacontryphan-M superimposes on known structures of contryphan-R and Vn (0.83 and 0.66 Å, respectively). Taken together these data identify that glacontryphan-M possesses the canonical contryphan intercysteine loop structure, yet possesses critical determinants necessary for a calcium-induced functionally required conformation. Glacontryphan-M, a novel calcium-dependent inhibitor of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels expressed in mouse pancreatic β-cells, was recently isolated from the venom of the cone snail Conus marmoreus (Hansson, K., Ma, X., Eliasson, L., Czerwiec, E., Furie, B., Furie, B.

Venomous marine snails belonging to the genus Conus synthesize neuropharmacologically active peptides, conotoxins, which demonstrate unique functional properties for use in prey envenomation and self-defense mechanisms. Conotoxins behave as antagonists, exhibiting molecular specificity for receptor isoforms and ion channels in the neuromuscular system. Most conotoxins appear to be derived from a few gene superfamilies, each distinguished by conserved signal and precursor sequence elements (1Espiritu D.J.D. Watkins M. Dia-Monje V. Cartier G.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1899-1916Google Scholar). The hallmark of these conotoxins is their conformationally constrained structure, often created through disulfide bridges. These conserved structural scaffolds provide a framework for the presentation of intervening hypervariable regions comprised of post-translationally modified amino acids that contribute to molecular specificity. Conotoxins of the contryphan family have been found with post-translational modifications including proline hydroxylation, C-terminal amidation, tryptophan bromination (2Jimenez E.C. Craig A.G. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 989-994Google Scholar), and leucine and tryptophan epimerization (3Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M.

The nine contryphans characterized to date share the conserved sequence motif, CP*(d-W or d-L)XPWC, that includes a tryptophan or leucine in the d-conformation, a disulfide bond between the two cysteines, and in some cases hydroxylation of the proline preceding the d-Trp residue, Pro*. The N-terminal Cys-Pro peptide bond exhibits cis-trans isomerization in the contryphans characterized to date; however, the more abundant cis isomer is believed to be the functionally relevant conformer (5Pallaghy P.K. He W. Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12845-12852Google Scholar). The contryphan motif CP*(d-W or L)XPWC is a robust structural scaffold, that maintains the backbone structure and α-β bond vector orientation independent of the amino acid that is substituted at residue X (6Pallaghy P.K. Norton R.S. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 173-179Google Scholar). This residue is Gln in contryphan-Sm (5Pallaghy P.K. He W. Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Norton R.S.

Functionally, the contryphans elicit a stiff tail syndrome in mice when injected intracranially, or a body tremor and mucous secretion when injected intramuscularly into fish (9Jimenez E.C.

Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Google Scholar). The metal binding properties and three-dimensional structure of conantokin-G suggest a structural role for Gla, whereby calcium ion binding by Gla residues increases the α-helicity and structural rigidity of the conantokin (16Rigby A.C.

Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Google Scholar and 20Stenflo J. Dahlback B. Stamatoyannopoulus G. Majerus P.W. Perlmutter R.M. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Disease. WB Saunders, New York2001: 579-613Google Scholar and references therein). It is well established that the vitamin K-dependent proteins bind to negatively charged phospholipids through a mechanism involving the N-terminal Gla domain (21Sunnerhagen M. Forsen S. Hoffren A.-M. Drakenberg T. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 504-509Google Scholar, 22Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Google Scholar, 23Huang M. Rigby A.C. Morelli X. Grant M.A. Huang G. Furie B. Seaton B. Furie B.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 751-756Google Scholar). Nine to twelve Gla residues in this domain (of 45–47 residues in total) facilitate interactions with an array of calcium ions to stabilize a conformation that is required for binding to phospholipid membranes. Apart from the conantokin and vitamin K-dependent protein families, the functional role of Gla is still largely unknown. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of glacontryphan-M, in the absence and presence of calcium using two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. Calcium ion binding induces perturbations of the N-terminal residues Gla2, Ser3, and Gla4, and the Cys11-Cys5-Pro6 region of the intercysteine loop, resulting in an increased exposure and slight reorientation of the stacked aromatic rings of His8 and d-Trp7 relative to the positioning of Trp10. Considering that glacontryphan-M is a calcium-dependent antagonist for L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels expressed in mouse pancreatic β-cells (11Hansson K. Ma X. Eliasson L. Czerwiec E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Rorsman P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 32453-32463Google Scholar), it is possible that this structural perturbation is necessary for glacontryphan-M to interact with the Ca2+ channel in a conformation that expresses a pharmacophore similar to known L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists. The elucidation of these molecular determinants will help us to better understand the functional role of Gla within glacontryphan-M and may shed light into the potential interactions that underlie the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonism exhibited by this unique conotoxin. A complete understanding of the pharmacological activity that is attributed to the triad of hydrophobic residues, d-Trp7, His8, and Trp10, in glacontryphan-M could lead to the development of novel neuropharmacological reagents. Peptide Synthesis—Glacontryphan-M and the glutamic acid-containing analogue, glucontryphan-M, were synthesized as described by Hansson et al. (11Hansson K. Ma X. Eliasson L. Czerwiec E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Rorsman P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 32453-32463Google Scholar). The masses of the peptides were confirmed by NanoElectro Spray Ionization (NanoESI)-mass spectrometry on an API QSTAR Pulsar-I quadrapole TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada), and the peptides were sequenced by amino acid sequencing as described previously (11Hansson K. Ma X. Eliasson L. Czerwiec E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Rorsman P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 32453-32463Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—Lyophilized glacontryphan-M was dissolved in H2O to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Samples were adjusted to either pH 5.8 or 7.0 and treated with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad) to remove contaminant metal ions. For calcium binding studies, CaCl2 was titrated into the samples to a final concentration of 6 mm. The CD spectra were collected on a JASCO 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) equipped with a thermoelectric temperature control unit. The spectrometer was calibrated using a standard of d-(+)-10-camphor sulfonic acid. The spectra presented are the average of three wavelength scans between 230 and 340 nm using a pathlength of 1.0 cm, a dwell time of 3 s/nm and at a temperature of 25 °C. All spectra were corrected for light scatter by buffer subtraction. Results are expressed in terms of units of absorption (uA) (24Pain R. Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 7.6.1-7.6.23Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Structure Determination of Glacontryphan-M— Proton assignments were determined from two-dimensional 1H NMR data recorded over a temperature range from 5 to 25 °C on a 500 MHz Varian Unity INOVA spectrometer with a proton frequency of 499.695 MHz. The three-dimensional structures of metal-free and calcium-bound glacontryphan-M were determined from data collected at 9 °C. Samples contained 3 mm synthetic glacontryphan-M peptide in 90% H2O:10% D2O, pH 5.8 or 7.0. The carrier frequency was set to the water resonance, which was suppressed using presaturation during the preacquisition delay. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 300, 350, and 400 ms at 9 °C. A total of 4096 real data points were acquired in t2 and 256 time-proportional phase increments (TPPI) were implemented in t1 with a spectral width of 8000 Hz in the F2 dimension. A total of 128 summed transients were collected with a relaxation delay of 1.12 s. Additional NOESY data were acquired with relyophilized samples of glacontryphan-M that were reconstituted in 99.996% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) at a noncorrected pH of 5.8 in order to complete the assignments of resonances located near the water peak and to detect weak NOE cross-peaks. Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 45 ms at 9 °C using the MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence (25Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). A total of 4096 real data points were acquired in t2 and 256 TPPI implemented in t1 with a spectral width of 8000 Hz in the F2 dimension. A total of 192 summed transients were collected with a relaxation delay of 1.12 s. Spectra were processed with Gaussian and sine bell functions for apodization in t2 and a shifted sine bell function in t1 using the VNMR software processing (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). All data were zero filled to 4K by 4K real matrices. A two-dimensional DQF-COSY spectrum was acquired with 4096 real data points in t2 and 640 TPPI were implemented in t1 with a spectral width of 8000 Hz in the F2 dimension. A total of 96 summed transients were collected for measurement of 3JHNα spin-spin coupling constants in order to derive dihedral torsion angles. A natural abundance 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum (HSQC) was acquired with 1024 real data points in t2 and 160 time proportional phase increments (TPPI) were implemented in t1 with a spectral width of 17591 Hz in the F1 dimension and 8000 Hz in the F2 dimension. Proton Resonance Assignments—Spin-system identifications of glacontryphan-M proton resonances in the absence of calcium and in the presence of calcium (15 molar equivalents) were completed using a combination DFQ-COSY and TOCSY experiments, which provided 1H-1H through-bond connectivities. For sequence-specific assignments, sequential dαN, dβN, and dNN NOE connectivities were obtained from NOESY experiments. The vicinal spin-spin coupling constants, 3JHNα, which were less than 6.2 Hz or greater than 8.0 Hz were used to calculate backbone ϕ torsion angles (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 479-564Google Scholar). NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, or weak and converted to distance restraint upper bounds of 2.5, 3.5, and 6.0 Å, respectively (27Barsukov I.L. Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 315-357Google Scholar). Scalar reference peaks were chosen from non-overlapped NH-αH NOE peaks and set to 2.8 Å distances for calibration of the entire set of distance restraints (28Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 130-199Google Scholar). Where possible rotamers of χ1 angles were categorized as either 60°, 180°, or –60° using qualitative analysis β-proton three-bond coupling (3JHαβ*) and NOE intensities, dαβ1, dαβ2, dNβ1, and dNβ2 (27Barsukov I.L. Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 315-357Google Scholar). Non-stereospecifically assigned atoms were treated as pseudoatoms and assigned correction distances (28Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 130-199Google Scholar). A 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum (HSQC) was recorded to determine the prolyl peptide bond conformations using the difference in their respective Cβ and Cγ chemical shifts (29Richarz R. Wurthrich K. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 2133-2141Google Scholar, 30Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J.A. Foss T.R. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 43-48Google Scholar). In addition, all of the 1H-13C resonances were assigned to verify the backbone and side chain proton assignments and to resolve ambiguities in assignment of the d-Trp7, His8, and Trp10 aromatic side chain proton chemical shifts arising from chemical shift degeneracy in the proton dimension. Structure Calculations—The three-dimensional structure of metal-free glacontryphan-M was determined from a total of 339 distance restraints (142 intraresidue, 197 interresidue; 116 sequential, 51 medium range, and 30 long range) and 30 torsion angle restraints, which were entered into the distance geometry program, DGII (CVFF force field parameters) of InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) to generate a family of 50 structures using a combination of simulated annealing and distance geometry (31Havel T.F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 56: 43-78Google Scholar). In the starting structure for molecular dynamics simulation the Cys5-Pro6 peptide bond was created in the cis conformation and the ω angle was fixed at 0° ± 10°, all other peptide bonds were created in the trans conformation. The first family of determined structures showed convergence of the orientation of the angle around the disulfide S-S bond, χ3. Greater than 80% of the convergent structures contained the right-handed disulfide bond conformation with a χ3 angle of approximately +60° (32Richardson J.S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Google Scholar). These data permitted the addition of distance restraints between the cysteine α-carbons and between the β-carbon of one cysteine and the sulfur atom of the other to the restraint file (32Richardson J.S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Google Scholar). The 35 conformations with the lowest restraint energy violations were used to represent the structure and the average structure for the ensemble was determined using the Analysis program of InsightII. Average root mean-squared deviation (RMSD) values following superimposition of the backbone heavy atoms of each structure with the geometric average reflected the quality of the determined family of structures. The structure determination of glacontryphan-M in the presence of 15 molar equivalents of calcium was determined in a manner similar to the methodology described above for the metal-free structure. The three-dimensional structure of calcium-bound glacontryphan-M was determined from a total of 288 distance restraints (135 intraresidue, 153 interresidue; 89 sequential, 46 medium range, and 18 long range) and 12 torsion angle restraints. Greater than 90% of the first family of determined structures showed convergence of the disulfide S-S bond orientation, χ3, therefore, we restrained the disulfide in the right-handed conformation as described above with a χ3 of approximately +60° (32Richardson J.S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Google Scholar). Based on the finding that glacontryphan-M expresses a single, saturable calcium-binding site (KD 0.63 mm) (11Hansson K. Ma X. Eliasson L. Czerwiec E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Rorsman P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 32453-32463Google Scholar), the final structure calculations included six distance restraints between the Cβ, the Cγ, the Cδ1 and C1 carbons of Gla2 and Gla4, to model a bound calcium ion between Gla2 and Gla4. These distance restraints were based on the measured distances between paired Gla residues (Gla25 and Gla30) involved in the coordination of a single calcium ion in known structures of the calcium-bound human factor IX Gla domain, FIX (1–47) (33Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12126-12137Google Scholar, 39Huang M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14338-14346Google Scholar). Inclusion of these restraints did not significantly perturb the protein backbone conformation or violate any of the NOE-derived distance constraints involving residues in the N terminus. The 30 conformations with the lowest restraint energy violations were used to represent the structure and the average structure for the ensemble was determined using the Analysis program of InsightII. The Cα trace and backbone heavy atoms of the average structure of calcium-bound glacontryphan-M were superimposed with the average structures of contryphan-R (7Pallaghy P.K. Melnikova A.P. Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 28: 11553-11559Google Scholar), contryphan-Vn (10Massilia G.R. Eliseo T. Grolleau F. Lapied B. Barbier J. Bournaud R. Molgo J. Cicero D.O. Paci M. Schinina M.E. Ascenzi P. Polticelli F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 238-246Google Scholar), and contryphan-Sm (5Pallaghy P.K. He W. Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12845-12852Google Scholar) using InsightII. To determine the high resolution structure of glacontryphan-M, a peptide having the mature glacontryphan-M sequence was synthesized with d-tryptophan at position 7, an amidated C terminus, and Gla residues at positions 2 and 4. The primary sequence and the identification of post-translational modifications of native glacontryphan-M (Table I), which was isolated and purified from the venom of C. marmoreous, were determined by automated Edman degradation and NanoESI mass spectrometry (11Hansson K. Ma X. Eliasson L. Czerwiec E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Rorsman P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 32453-32463Google Scholar). Following the synthesis and initial purification of glacontryphan-M, the Cys5-Cys11 disulfide bond was formed by oxidative refolding. The HPLC elution profiles of the natural and synthetic glacontryphan-M peptides were identical and when co-injected, the two peptides co-migrated (11Hansson K. Ma X. Eliasson L. Czerwiec E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Rorsman P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 32453-32463Google Scholar). Determination of the Structure of Glacontryphan-M using Two-dimensional NMR Spectroscopy—The solution structure of glacontryphan-M in the absence of calcium was solved by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy using NOESY, TOCSY, and DQF-COSY spectra collected at 9 °C and a pH of 5.8. Additional NOESY spectra collected at 35 °C and 15 °C and at 9 °C in fully deuterated solvent permitted the assignment of proton resonances close to the bulk solvent peak and provided additional NOE information. Proton resonances were assigned using sequential connectivities determined by correlating αH and side chain proton connectivities to backbone amide (NH) protons of neighboring residues (28Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 130-199Google Scholar). The annotated “fingerprint” region of a representative NOESY spectrum (Fig. 1) shows the sequential residue αN(i, i+1) and βN(i, i+1) connectivities that are observed throughout the peptide in the absence of calcium. In addition, medium and long-range αN(i, i+n) and βN(i, i+n) connectivities that define this well structured peptide are included. The proton resonance chemical shifts for metal-free glacontryphan-M are presented in Table II. In contrast to the published results for contryphan-Sm (5Pallaghy P.K. He W. Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12845-12852Google Scholar), contryphan-R (7Pallaghy P.K. Melnikova A.P. Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 28: 11553-11559Google Scholar), and contryphan-Vn (10Massilia G.R. Eliseo T. Grolleau F. Lapied B. Barbier J. Bournaud R. Molgo J. Cicero D.O. Paci M. Schinina M.E. Ascenzi P.

Commun. 2003; 303: 238-246Google Scholar), glacontryphan-M is a single homogenous conformer exhibiting no cis to trans isomerization of the Cys-Pro peptidyl bond in aqueous solution over the temperature range investigated (9–25 °C).Table II1H chemical shift assignments for glacontryphan-M in the absence or presence of calciumResidueChemical shiftsaGiven in absence of calcium (presence of calcium in parentheses) at 9 °C, pH 5.8 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O.HNαHβHOtherppm7.455, 6.783 NH2Asn14.0202.695 (2.671)(7.440, 6.764)Gla28.980 (8.830)3.981 (4.016)2.019, 1.8112.925 (2.914) γH3.598, 3.504Scr38.046 (8.146)4.067 (4.071)(3.586, 3.500)Gla47.964 (8.164)3.992 (4.00)2.050, 1.9442.988 γHCys57.8274.2662.718, 2.343Pro63.9811.671, 0.9441.155, 0.221 γH2.953, 2.804 δHd-Trp78.351 (8.261)4.4542.898, 2.5626.807 δ1H, 9.824 ϵ1H, 7.100 ϵ3H, 7.061ζ2H, 6.693 ζ3H, 6.826 η2HHis86.459 (6.479)4.3321.073, 0.7056.725 δ2H8.382 ϵ1HPro93.8442.105, 1.8041.909, 1.835 γH3.394, 3.136 δHTrp106.0054.4033.195, 2.9256.756 δ1H, 10.043 ϵ1H 7.315 ϵ3H, 6.654 ζ2H 6.920 ζ3H, 6.709η2HCys116.807 (6.887)4.0552.800NH27.006, 7.407a Given in absence of calcium (presence of calcium in parentheses) at 9 °C, pH 5.8 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O.

Kroon G.J.A. Foss T.R. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 43-48Google Scholar), adjusted for temperature (Fig. 2). Deviations from these random coil values for the NH proton, αH proton, and Cα carbon backbone chemical shifts provide information on the peptide backbone structure (28Wuthrich K.

This allowed us to functionally study these ATPases by both kinetic and spectroscopic means, and to solve previous discrepancies in the published literature about both experimental facts and interpretation concerning the role of this loop in P-type ATPases. We show that in a solubilized state, the ADA mutant experiences a dramatic decrease of its calcium-dependent ATPase activity. On the contrary, reconstituted in a lipid environment, it displays an almost unaltered maximal calcium-dependent ATPase activity at high (millimolar) ATP, with an apparent affinity for Ca2+ altered only moderately (3-fold). In the absence of ATP, the true affinity of ADA for Ca2+ is, however, more significantly reduced (20–30-fold) compared with WT, as judged from intrinsic (Trp) or extrinsic (fluorescence isothiocyanate) fluorescence experiments. At low ATP, transient kinetics experiments reveal an overshoot in the ADA phosphorylation level primarily arising from the slowing down of the transition between the nonphosphorylated “E2” and “Ca2E1” forms of ADA. At high ATP, this slowing down is only partially compensated for, as ADA turnover remains more sensitive to orthovanadate than WT turnover. ADA ATPase also proved to have a reduced affinity for ATP in studies performed under equilibrium conditions in the absence of Ca2+, highlighting the long range interactions between L6–7 and the nucleotide-binding site. We propose that these mutations in L6–7 could affect protonation-dependent winding and unwinding events in the nearby M6 transmembrane segment.

In fast twitch muscle this transport is achieved by the SERCA1a isoform of Ca2+-ATPase (3MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

SR Ca2+-ATPase belongs to the family of P-type ATPases, which transport cations such as H+, Na+, K+, or Ca2+ across the membrane and share a common mechanism that involves autophosphorylation of the protein (see review in Ref. 6Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Google Scholar): transport is achieved through a reversible cycle, during which the ATPase is thought to sequentially adopt two main conformations (7Makinose M. FEBS Lett. 1973; 37: 140-143Google Scholar, 8de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev.

The membrane domain contains two calcium-binding sites, distant from the phosphorylation (P) and the nucleotide-binding (N) domains, with calcium liganding residues consistent with the results previously obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (17Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Google Scholar, 18Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Google Scholar). Comparison of these two three-dimensional structures shows that the cytosolic domains undergo very large movements, being separated from each other in Ca2E1 while they are in close contact in E2. Previously, by combining limited proteolysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we have drawn attention to the cytosolic L6–7 loop, connecting transmembrane segments 6 and 7 and stretching from Phe809 to Ser830 (19Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. de Gracia A.G. Soulié S. Centeno F. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Google Scholar, 20Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Google Scholar, 21Menguy T. Corre F. Juul B. Bouneau L. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Sharma P.S. Falson P. Levine B.A. Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13016-13028Google Scholar). Cluster mutations D813A,D818A (ADA) or D813A,D815A,D818A (AAA) in this loop were found to reduce the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of the protein in its solubilized state (19Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. de Gracia A.G. Soulié S. Centeno F. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Google Scholar) as well as the apparent affinity for calcium for the protein, suggesting a role of the L6–7 loop in activation by calcium during the early steps of the cycle (20Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Google Scholar). The reduction of the cation binding ability of the Ca2+-ATPase L6–7 loop after mutation was confirmed by studying a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to the L6–7 loop, Gly808–Pro827, which was found to interact with calcium and to bind lanthanum, in contrast with a related peptide in which an AAA cluster mutation had been introduced (21Menguy T. Corre F. Juul B. Bouneau L. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Sharma P.S. Falson P. Levine B.A. Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13016-13028Google Scholar). In another laboratory both the ADA ATPase mutant and a more conservative related one, D813N,D818N, were found to bind less 45Ca2+ than WT in the presence of a micromolar Ca2+ concentration (22Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Google Scholar). The L6–7 loop was thus suggested to provide an entrance port for calcium, with the negatively charged aspartic residues involved in a pre-binding site (21Menguy T. Corre F. Juul B. Bouneau L. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Sharma P.S. Falson P. Levine B.A. Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13016-13028Google Scholar), and recent computer simulations accepted this view (23Costa V. Carloni P. Proteins. 2003; 50: 104-113Google Scholar). However, evidence has been obtained from the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-ATPase that the L6–7 loop was located too far away from the two high affinity calcium-binding sites to participate directly in the binding of calcium to these sites; this was confirmed by our finding fact that WT and mutant (ADA) ATPases were both able to occlude calcium in the presence of Cr-ATP (21Menguy T. Corre F. Juul B. Bouneau L. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Sharma P.S. Falson P. Levine B.A. Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13016-13028Google Scholar). A detailed site-directed mutagenesis study of several residues of the L6–7 loop then suggested that the main role of this loop was to stabilize the ATPase structure and the cross-talk between the Ca2+-binding and phosphorylation domains, through an extended network of hydrogen bonds (24Zhang Z. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15232-15239Google Scholar). A comparable study carried out with Na+, K+-ATPase revealed that removal of the negatively charged residues in the corresponding loop only had a moderate effect on the affinity of the enzyme for potassium, but made the mutants more sensitive to denaturation by SDS (25Xu G. Farley R.A. Kane D.J. Faller L.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 96-100Google Scholar). From all the above experiments, it appears that the L6–7 loop is functionally important, but that both experimental facts and interpretation still need clarification. In view of the likely importance of this loop, we decided to investigate further the ADA mutant, now using an improved yeast overexpression system (26Falson P. Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thinès D. le Maire M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 312-314Google Scholar) together with a recently developed procedure (27Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thinès D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Google Scholar, 28Lenoir G. Montigny C. le Maire M. Falson P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 333-334Google Scholar) to purify and reconstitute into lipids the expressed WT and mutated ATPases. This allowed us not only to use classical approaches to study these expressed proteins, but also to use fluorescence approaches (intrinsic or extrinsic (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)) fluorescence) to monitor ATPase conformational changes. The latter approaches of course require a sufficient level of protein purity, and as far as we are aware, the present report is the first one with a mutated form of SERCA1a Ca2+-ATPase amenable to both kinetic and spectroscopic investigation. This study allowed us to solve previous experimental discrepancies and to pinpoint the transitions affected by mutation of Asp813 and Asp818. It supports the idea that the L6–7 loop is involved in an interplay between the transmembrane Ca2+-binding sites and the cytosolic domains, not only the P domain as previously suggested (24Zhang Z. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15232-15239Google Scholar), but also the nucleotide-binding domain. Finally this work suggests specific perspectives for interpretation of the results and future work. Materials—The electrophoresis miniprotean 3, transblot module, GS-700 densitometer, Molecular Analyst software, and Bio-beads were from Bio-Rad. Yeast culture products were from Difco Laboratories. N-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) was from Anatrace Inc. (Anagrade) and C12E8 (octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether) was from Nikko Chemical Co. (Tokyo). Low molecular weight markers and PD-10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Other products were purchased from Sigma. The STORM 860 PhosphorImager was from Amersham Biosciences. The rapid mixing QFM5 device was from Biologic, Claix, France. The Multiskan Bichromatic spectrophotometer was from Labsystems. The Sigmaplot software was from SSPS, Inc. The SimZyme software was a kind gift from Dr. Jens Peter Andersen (Aarhus, Denmark). SR Membrane Preparation—SR vesicles were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle according to de Meis and Hasselbach (29de Meis L. Hasselbach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4759-4763Google Scholar) and Champeil et al. (30Champeil P. Guillain F. Venien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Google Scholar). Before the preparation, the rabbits were subjected to a 48-h starvation diet (31Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutierrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Google Scholar). Expression of WT and ADA SERCA1a Ca2+-ATPase Species in Yeast, and Protein Estimation—The methods used for construction of expression plasmids, cultures, and preparation of membrane fractions were described previously (20Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Google Scholar, 27Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thinès D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Google Scholar). After SERCA expression in yeast, the light membrane fractions containing the expressed Ca2+-ATPase were collected by differential centrifugation and stored in a medium containing 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. Proteins were estimated by using the bicinchoninic acid procedure (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The expressed Ca2+-ATPase was quantified after SDS-PAGE by immunodetection, as described previously (20Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Google Scholar). Purification of C-terminal His-tagged Ca2+-ATPase—Purification of WT and ADA ATPases was as described previously (27Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thinès D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Google Scholar), except that the second step in our original procedure (affinity chromatography step on a Reactive Red column) was omitted here. Minor changes were also made: (i) ADA Ca2+-ATPase was solubilized with DDM at a detergent: protein ratio of 5:1 (w/w) instead of 3:1, (ii) after Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography the buffer of the pooled His-tagged Ca2+-ATPase was exchanged, using a PD-10 device, with buffer of the following composition: 25 mm Mops-Tris, pH 7.0, 40% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml DDM, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.25 mg/ml of an egg yolk lipid suspension. The lipid suspension was made up of a 10:1 ratio (w/w) of l-α-phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) and phosphatidic acid (EYPA), the resulting vesicles being homogenized to a size of 100–300 nm by passing the suspension through a filter device (Avestin, Hamilton) calibrated to 100 nm (33MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Google Scholar). The lipid concentration in the PD-10 pool was increased to 1 mg/ml by using the same EYPC-EYPA suspension, and DDM was then removed by adding 200 mg of Bio-beads per mg of detergent and gently stirring for 3 h. Aliquots of the purified fraction were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Purity was checked on 8% gels by Laemmli-type SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), by Coomassie Blue staining after 1 h migration at 25 mA/gel, and quantitation of expressed Ca2+-ATPase was performed with a GS-700 densitometer, using rabbit SR Ca2+-ATPase as standard. ATPase Activity Measurements—Spectrophotometric measurements of ATP hydrolysis by the Ca2+-ATPase was routinely performed at 20 °C with an ATP-regenerating coupled enzyme assay originally described by Pullman and co-workers (35Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Datta A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Google Scholar) and subsequently adapted (36Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Google Scholar, 37Lund S. Orlowski S. de Foresta B. Champeil P. le Maire M. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4907-4915Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in 2 ml of a medium containing 50 mm Tes-Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm KNO3, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, an initial concentration of about 0.3 mm NADH, 3–6 μg/ml purified Ca2+-ATPase, and 0.1 mm total CaCl2. When needed, EGTA was added to yield the desired [Ca2+]free (38Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Google Scholar), using a Ca2+-EGTA apparent dissociation constant of about 0.5 μm in the presence of 7 mm MgCl2 (0.4 μm in the absence of Mg2+ at pH 7.0). The reaction was initiated by addition of either 2 μm or 1 mm Na2ATP, as indicated. When indicated, a solubilizing concentration of 1 mg/ml C12E8 was added to the ATPase assay medium. Measurements of ATPase activity performed in the context of inhibition by orthovanadate are described in the legend to Fig. H in the supplemental material (83Drueckes P. Schinzel R. Palm D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 173-177Google Scholar, 84Saheki S. Takeda A. Shimazu T. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 277-281Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Spex fluorolog instrument. Intrinsic fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 and 330 nm and bandwidths of 2 and 20 nm, respectively, with about 5 μg/ml only of purified and reconstituted WT or ADA Ca2+-ATPase (or, again, SR vesicles). ATPase labeling with FITC and the subsequent FITC measurements were performed as described in the legend to Fig. D in the supplemental material. Phosphorylation from ATP and Pi, and Electrophoretic Separation After Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP was measured at 20 °C unless otherwise indicated, by adding 2 μm concentration of 2 mCi/μmol [γ-32P]ATP to WT or ADA mutated Ca2+-ATPase at about 2 μg/ml (about 1 μg per assay) in buffer A (50 mm Mops-Tris, pH 7.0 (20 °C), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2), supplemented with various concentrations of CaCl2 (or of a Ca2+/EGTA buffer). Phosphorylation measurements in the millisecond range were performed at 20 °C with a rapid mixing and quenching apparatus. When indicated, ATPase phosphorylation was also measured in the same medium on ice, and dephosphorylation was subsequently triggered by adding 100 μm non-radioactive ATP, followed by acid quenching (see below). Phosphorylation from [32P]Pi was measured at 20 °C by adding 100 μm concentration of 2 mCi/μmol [32P]Pi to about 1 μg of WT or ADA Ca2+-ATPase suspended in 100 μl of 100 mm Mops-Tris (pH 7.0), 20% Me2SO, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Ca2+, and various concentrations of EGTA. The reaction was stopped by acid quenching with trichloroacetic acid and H3PO4, added at final concentrations of 1 m and 67 mm, respectively. Handling of phosphorylated samples, electrophoretic separation using either Sarkadi-type gels (39Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Google Scholar) or Weber and Osborn gels (40Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Google Scholar), and final counting of radioactivity was performed essentially as described previously (39Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Google Scholar, 41Menguy T. Chenevois S. Guillain F. le Maire M. Falson P. Champeil P. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 141-148Google Scholar, 42Lenoir G. Picard M. Gauron C. Montigny C. Le Marechal P. Falson P. le Maire M. Moller J.V. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9156-9166Google Scholar), with minor changes described under the supplemental material. Data Analysis—The SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.) was used to prepare graphic representations of the data. The kinetic simulation software SimZyme (43Sørensen T.L. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Google Scholar, 44Andersen J.P. Sorensen T.L. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Google Scholar) was used to simulate the amount of phosphoenzyme formed as a function of time. Purification and Reconstitution of wild-type (WT) and D813A,D818A (ADA) SERCA Ca2+-ATPases Expressed in Yeast—WT and ADA-mutated Ca2+-ATPases were expressed in yeast and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as recently described (27Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thinès D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Google Scholar), except that the second affinity chromatography on a Reactive Red column was omitted, as the purity obtained after the first step was found sufficient for functional characterization of the purified enzymes. Starting from 400 mg of yeast, “light” membrane proteins containing 2% of expressed Ca2+-ATPase (lane Mb in Fig. 1), about 0.6 mg of WT or ADA ATPases, was partially purified, to about 50–60% homogeneity (lanes WT and ADA in Fig. 1), and detergent removal allowed us to form lipid vesicles of 100 to 300 nm diameter containing the reconstituted proteins (as shown by freeze fracture electron microscopy, see Fig. A in the supplemental material (82Duchesne L. Hubert J.F. Verbavatz J.M. Thomas D. Pietrantonio P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 422-429Google Scholar), courtesy from Jean-Marc Verbavatz, CEA Saclay). Ca2+-dependent ATPase Activity of Reconstituted or C12E8-solubilized WT and ADA-ATPases—In our previous work (19Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. de Gracia A.G. Soulié S. Centeno F. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Google Scholar, 20Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Google Scholar), to measure the activity of expressed Ca2+-ATPase, we found it necessary to add C12E8 at a solubilizing concentration to the ATPase assay medium, because this detergent reduced the background originating from contaminating ATPases or oxidases present in yeast membrane fractions. In the present work, as expressed SERCA was at least partially purified, the activity of reconstituted WT and ADA ATPases could be studied both in the presence and absence of detergent. In the presence of C12E8 (and at 20 °C), as can be seen from Fig. 2A, the WT enzyme (circles) and the ADA mutant (squares) displayed very different behaviors, as previously reported (20Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Google Scholar): the ADA mutant (squares) was only very weakly activated by increasing Ca2+ concentrations; activation by Ca2+ was also rather sluggish when DDM was used instead of C12E8 (not shown). In contrast, when ATPase measurements were performed in the absence of detergent, as shown in Fig. 2B, the ADA mutant now displayed full maximal velocity, with a Km for Ca2+ of 1–2 μm, i.e. only moderately higher than that of WT ATPase, 0.3 μm (for WT ATPase, the Km for Ca2+ was only slightly shifted toward higher affinity when detergent was omitted, as previously found for SR ATPase (36Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Google Scholar)). Similar results were obtained when the ATPase activity of the purified and reconstituted proteins was assayed with strontium (45Fujimori T. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18466-18474Google Scholar, 46Orlowski S. Champeil P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 296-300Google Scholar), as displayed in the inset of Fig. 2B: WT and ADA ATPases displayed Km values for Sr2+ of 15 and 35 μm, respectively, showing that the shift in cation affinity for ADA compared with WT was the same for Ca2+ and Sr2+. The data obtained in the absence of detergent (Fig. 2B) confirm the limited effect of the ADA mutation on the Km for Ca2+ previously described by Zhang et al. (22Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Google Scholar) for ATPases expressed in COS cells membranes. Conversely, the poor sensitivity to Ca2+ of the hydrolytic activity of the ADA mutant in the presence of detergent, shown in Fig. 2A, shows that the functional properties of the ADA mutant are markedly affected by solubilization with C12E8 (see Supplemental Materials for additional comments on reconstitution and the effect of detergents). Note that for both preparations, activities measured at very low free Ca2+ (and Sr2+) concentrations were similar, and probably arose from residual protein contaminants. Note also that the maximal Ca2+-dependent fraction of ATPase activity was about 1.2 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per mg of protein/min, a Vmax 3–4 times lower than that of rabbit SR Ca2+-ATPase (not shown): as previously discussed (27Lenoir G. Menguy T. Corre F. Montigny C. Pedersen P.A. Thinès D. le Maire M. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1560: 67-83Google Scholar), this reduced Vmax probably derives from the fact that part of the ATPase experiences irreversible inactivation during purification, whereas the remaining fraction behaves in a normal way. True Equilibrium Affinity for Ca2+(or Sr2+) of Unphosphorylated WT or ADA ATPase, as Revealed by the Conformational Changes Monitored by Intrinsic or Extrinsic Fluorescence—As a complement to the above ATPase measurements with the ADA mutant, which only reveal the apparent Km for Ca2+, we measured by an independent assay the true equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for Ca2+ of the ADA mutant, taking advantage of the relative purity of our reconstituted expressed ATPase to use intrinsic fluorescence to monitor Ca2+-dependent changes (47Dupont Y. Guillain F. Lacapère J.-J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 206-219Google Scholar), as was also recently done with WT purified SERCA1a Ca2+-ATPase expressed with the Sf9/baculovirus system (48Miras R. Cuillel M. Catty P. Guillain F. Mintz E. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 22: 299-306Google Scholar). Such measurements were performed at pH 7 in the absence of Mg2+ to maximize Ca2+-dependent fluorescence changes (49Guillain F. Gingold M.P. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7366-7371Google Scholar). As shown in panel A of Fig. 3, starting from a situation where the total Ca2+ concentration in the fluorometer cuvette was ∼55 μm it was indeed possible to monitor both with WT and ADA ATPases, first the decrease in Trp fluorescence expected when calcium dissociation was triggered by the addition of excess EGTA, and then its recovery when the free Ca2+ concentration was subsequently raised by sequential additions of Ca2+. For ADA ATPase, however, such recovery required higher Ca2+ concentrations. From the plot displayed in Fig. 3C, the Kd of WT Ca2+-ATPase was estimated to be about 0.3 μm, a value close to that of native SR in the same conditions (0.4 μm) and consistent with that reported previously at pH 7 in the absence of Mg2+ (50Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Google Scholar), whereas for the ADA mutant it was about 8 μm, i.e. the Kd was 20 to 30 times higher. A similar shift in the affinity of ADA compared with WT was also found when Sr2+ instead of Ca2+ was added to the Ca2+-free ATPases (Fig. 3B). Note that the relatively small amplitude of the observed changes in Trp fluorescence observed for our partially purified preparations, about 2 versus 5–6% for native SR (not shown), is consistent with the above mentioned presence of protein contaminants and/or inactive ATPase in these preparations. It obviously makes the experiments difficult but the results shown in Fig. 3 were nevertheless nicely reproducible. In addition, the difference between WT and ADA traces, as well as other experiments (not shown) with fully inactive mutants, provides an internal control that contaminants play no role in these Ca2+-dependent fluorescence signals, beyond reducing the relative amplitude of the observed ligand-dependent changes. Additional experiments performed after labeling purified and reconstituted WT or ADA ATPases with FITC, an extrinsic label that covalently binds to lysine 515 in the nucleotide-binding domain of ATPase, made it possible to"

A RanGDP-binding protein, NTF2, facilitates translocation of RanGDP through the nuclear pore complex and also acts to stabilize RanGDP against nucleotide exchange. Here, we identify a novel activity that stimulates release of GDP from Ran in the presence of NTF2. Hydrolyzable ATP enhances the GDP dissociation activity, and this enhancement is inhibited by nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues. In contrast, neither hydrolyzable ATP nor nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues affect GDP dissociation from Ran catalyzed by recombinant RCC1 or inhibition of GDP dissociation from Ran by recombinant NTF2. The ATP-dependent RanGDP dissociation activity therefore has the properties of a RanGDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) displacement factor (RanGDF) where the GDI is NTF2. A protein phosphatase inhibitor mixture stimulates the RanGDF activity, suggesting the activity is regulated by phosphorylation.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases, Ran exists in both GTPand GDP-bound states, abbreviated as RanGTP and RanGDP. These two forms of Ran interact differently with regulators and effectors (4Avis J.A. Clarke P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase activity of Ran is very low but is greatly stimulated by a GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) that is localized in the cytoplasm and on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (5Bischoff F.R.

The compartmentalized localization of these regulators maintains a high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus and a low concentration in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (11Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 12Görlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R.

Weis K. Heald R. Science. 2002; 295: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This gradient of RanGTP concentration across the nuclear envelope is critical for the directionality of transport of many macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm (15Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Unlike some small GTPases, where only the GTP-bound form has binding partners, both RanGTP and RanGDP interact with nuclear transport factors. In the context of this manuscript, the RanGDP-binding protein NTF2/p10 (16Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 17Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 18Paschal B.M. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is important. NTF2 exists as a homodimer and has two functions; one is to promote the import of RanGDP into the nucleus (19Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by facilitating diffusion through the NPC. Second, NTF2 interacts directly and specifically with RanGDP and stabilizes RanGDP against RCC1-mediated nucleotide exchange (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the NTF2-RanGDP complex (22Stewart M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) reveals direct contacts between the hydrophobic cavity of NTF2 and the switch II region of RanGDP. Independently of its binding to RanGDP, NTF2 also interacts with FG repeat-containing nucleoporins (17Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 23Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and is found concentrated at NPCs at steady state. The interactions between NTF2 and both RanGDP and FG repeats are essential for efficient nuclear import of RanGDP (24Clarkson W.D. Corbett A.H. Paschal B.M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. Gerace L. Silver P.A.

Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The recently solved crystal structure of the RCC1-Ran complex (28Renault L. Kuhlmann J. Henkel A. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2001; 105: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) indicates that NTF2 and RCC1 cannot bind simultaneously to RanGDP. Thus, RanGDP has to dissociate from NTF2 for RCC1-mediated nucleotide exchange to occur. The continuous regeneration of RanGTP from RanGDP is critical for all the known functions of Ran. Recently, the activities of the known components of the Ran system were analyzed by the construction of a mathematical model (13Görlich D. Seewald M.J. Ribbeck K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The model predicted that the functioning of the Ran system is particularly sensitive to two parameters. The first is the GTP:GDP ratio of the cell, in part a reflection of the fact that Ran has a significantly higher affinity for GDP than GTP (10Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 13Görlich D. Seewald M.J. Ribbeck K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The second is the delivery of RanGDP to the exchange factor RCC1 (13Görlich D. Seewald M.J. Ribbeck K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In interphase, the latter process involves facilitation of RanGDP diffusion through the NPC by NTF2 followed by its dissociation from NTF2. Both steps are necessary before RCC1-mediated nucleotide exchange can occur. The fact that NTF2 binds RanGDP tightly enough to inhibit RCC1-mediated nucleotide exchange on Ran (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that a factor might exist that would help dissociate the RanGDP-NTF2 complex. Here, we have identified a novel activity that releases RanGDP from NTF2 in an ATP-dependent manner. We propose that this activity plays a role in the function of the RanGDP/GTP cycle. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Wild-type Ran, RanT24N, RanQ69L, wild-type NTF2, and RCC1 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hetzer M. Bilbao-Cortes D. Walter T.C. Gruss O.J. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1013-1024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The pET 15b-W7A NTF2 mutant (27Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Murray Stewart. The protein, like wild-type NTF2, was expressed and purified as described previously (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were exchanged into transport buffer (TB) (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science)) using a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and then concentrated using Centricon YM3 (Amicon). Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Preparation and Fractionation of Mouse Ehrlich Ascites Tumor Cells Extract—Ehrlich ascites tumor cells extract was prepared and fractionated as described previously (30Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3617-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For fractionation, the clarified extract was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm cytochalasin B, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin) and eluted sequentially with potassium acetate-free transport buffer containing 200 mm, 350 mm, and 550 mm potassium chloride. The flow-through fraction and eluted fractions (termed QFT, Q200, Q350, and Q550, respectively) were dialyzed against TB and concentrated by collodion dialysis to a uniform protein concentration (10 mg/ml). Then the Q200 fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 20 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete EDTA-free buffer, concentrated by Centriprep YM3 (Amicon), and applied to a HiTrap SP column equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions (termed SP20, SP50, SP100, SP150, SP200, SP350 and SP500, respectively) were eluted stepwise in buffer containing 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 350, and 500 mm sodium chloride. Assay for Dissociation of [3H]GDP from Ran—[3H]GDP dissociation was assayed by a rapid filtration method as described previously (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of Endogenous RCC1 from Ehrlich Ascites Tumor Cells Extract—For depletion of endogenous RCC1 from the SP200, RanT24N coupled to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) was used as described previously (29Hetzer M. Bilbao-Cortes D. Walter T.C. Gruss O.J. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1013-1024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). RanQ69L or bovine serum albumin coupled to Affi-Gel-10 were used for control experiments. The ΔRCC1-SP200 was recovered and immediately used for the filter trap assay. Immunoblot Analysis—Fractions from the Ehrlich ascites tumor cells extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Anti-NTF2 monoclonal antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-histone H2A polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-histone H2B polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-RCC1 rabbit serum were used as primary antibodies. An ATP-dependent Ran GDP Dissociation Activity—The nucleotide exchange activity of Ran was assayed by measuring the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Ran-[3H]GDP. In this assay, 0.01 μm recombinant RCC1 catalytically induced the [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran (Fig. 1A) with a maximum efficiency in the presence of 0.67 μm of Ran-[3H]GDP (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [3H]GDP dissociation catalyzed by RCC1 was inhibited by wild-type NTF2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). 3.3 μm wild-type NTF2 completely inhibited the [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran under these conditions (Fig. 1A). Comparison with the endogenous situation is not straightforward. However, virtually all of the RanGDP that enters the cell nucleus, and thus might encounter RCC1, is bound to NTF2 dimers (13Görlich D. Seewald M.J. Ribbeck K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 19Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The W7A NTF2 mutant (27Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which binds poorly to XFXFG-repeat containing nucleoporins but retains binding affinity for RanGDP, inhibited [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran like wild-type NTF2 (Fig. 1A). We next investigated whether a factor that would stimulate NTF2 release from RanGDP could be detected. For the assay, we used a Q200 fraction prepared from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells extract (see “Experimental Procedures”). The Q200 fraction, but not the other Q fractions (QFT, Q350, and Q550), slightly stimulated [3H]GDP dissociation by RCC1 in the presence of wild-type NTF2 (17% stimulation of [3H]GDP dissociation) or the W7A NTF2 mutant (23% stimulation of [3H]GDP dissociation; Fig. 1B). These activities in the Q200 were greatly stimulated by the addition of an ATP regeneration system (60% stimulation of [3H]GDP dissociation in the case of wild-type NTF2 and 61% stimulation of [3H]GDP dissociation for the W7A NTF2 mutant; Fig. 1B). Recombinant RCC1 and NTF2 Are Not Affected by ATP— RCC1 and NTF2 were potential targets of ATP-dependent activity. To examine whether intrinsic RanGEF activity or RanGDI activity is affected by ATP, we examined the effects of ATP on [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran by recombinant RCC1 or the inhibition of the [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran by recombinant wild-type NTF2. As expected, recombinant RCC1 dissociated [3H]GDP from Ran in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). With each dose (3.3 or 6.6 nm) of RCC1, we examined the effects of the presence of an ATP regeneration system, two nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, or ATP alone. RCC1 at 3.3 or 6.6 nm induced 43 or 65% dissociation, respectively, of [3H]GDP from Ran. Neither the ATP regeneration system, ATPγS (3 mm), AMP-PNP (3 mm), nor ATP (3 mm) affected the activity of recombinant RCC1 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, neither the ATP regeneration system, ATPγS, AMP-PNP, nor ATP had an effect on the RanGDI activity of 1.7 μm of recombinant NTF2 (Fig. 2B). ATP-dependent GDP Dissociation from Ran Requires NTF2 and Is Not Mediated by RCC1—To investigate whether endogenous RCC1 is involved in inducing the ATP-dependent [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran, we further fractionated the activity. The Q200 was applied to a HiTrap SP column, and fractions (SP20, SP50, SP100, SP150, SP200, SP350, and SP500) were eluted stepwise (see “Experimental Procedures”). By immunoblot analysis, most endogenous RCC1 and NTF2 was present in the Q200 fractions (Fig. 3A and data not shown). After separation, NTF2 predominantly eluted in the SP20 fraction (Fig. 3A), whereas RCC1 was eluted mainly in SP20, SP350, and SP500, with minor amounts present in SP200. The [3H]GDP dissociation activity of each SP fraction and its stimulation by ATP were measured in the presence of recombinant RCC1 and the W7A NTF2 mutant (Fig. 3B). The ATP-dependent [3H]GDP dissociation activity was predominantly found in the SP20 (FT) and SP200 fractions. Although much stronger [3H]GDP dissociation activities were present in both the SP350 and the SP500 fractions, these were little affected by the presence of ATP, and therefore their presence was likely because of endogenous RCC1. Histones H2A and H2B, which have been shown to have a mild stimulatory effect on RCC1 activity (31Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), were also present mainly in the SP350 and 500 fractions (Fig. 3A). To more definitively rule out the participation of endogenous RanGEF in the ATP-dependent activity, we next depleted endogenous RCC1 from the SP200 using RanT24N coupled to Affi-Gel-10 beads (RanT24N-SP200). Most endogenous RCC1 (>90%) was depleted by this treatment (Fig. 4A), whereas control beads coupled to either RanQ69L or bovine serum albumin caused a less efficient depletion of RCC1 (Fig. 4A). Using these depleted SP200 fractions, the effects of the ATP regeneration system on the [3H]GDP dissociation in the presence of recombinant RCC1 and NTF2 were examined. As expected, total [3H]GDP dissociation activity was reduced by RCC1 depletion, with almost no ATP-independent stimulation remaining (Fig. 4B). However, the ATP-dependent activity of the SP200 fraction (28.7% dissociation) was recovered similarly in the Q69L-depleted (20.0%), the bovine serum albumin-depleted (22.8%), and the T24N-depleted (20.0%) fractions, indicating that it was not due to endogenous RCC1. Next we examined the effects of the ATP regeneration system on the intrinsic RanGEF activity in the Q200, SP20 and SP200 fractions in the absence of added recombinant RCC1 or NTF2. Endogenous NTF2 is present in the Q200 and SP20 fractions (see above). The ATP regeneration system enhanced [3H]GDP dissociation in the presence of the Q200 (58% stimulation) and the SP20 (54% stimulation) but not the SP200 fraction (9% stimulation; Fig. 3C). These results, in combination with those presented above, suggest that the stimulation of [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran by ATP depends on NTF2. In other words, ATP may regulate RanGDP release from NTF2 by a factor or factors present in the SP200 fraction. In fact, the SP200 fraction in the presence of ATP released NTF2 from RanGDP to a considerable extent (Fig. 5). ATP-dependent NTF2-releasing Activity Is Stimulated by Phosphatase Inhibitors—To further clarify the mechanism of the ATP-dependent GDI displacement activity, we tested the effects of two nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues (ATPγS or AMP-PNP) on [3H]GDP dissociation activity in the SP200 fraction. The ATP regeneration system significantly stimulated dissociation activity in the presence of NTF2 (Fig. 6). The two nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues did not affect the ATP-independent [3H]GDP dissociation activity of the SP200. However, stimulation of the activity by ATP was inhibited (Fig. 6). These results suggest that ATP hydrolysis is essential for ATP-dependent dissociation activity. To clarify whether the ATP-dependent [3H]GDP dissociation activity might be regulated by phosphorylation, we examined the effects of a protein phosphatase inhibitor mixture on the activity. The phosphatase inhibitor mixture significantly stimulated the [3H]GDP dissociation of the SP200 in the presence of NTF2 (24% stimulation; Fig. 7A). In the absence of recombinant NTF2, the phosphatase inhibitor mixture did not however stimulate [3H]GDP dissociation (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that the ATP-dependent [3H]GDP dissociation activity is probably regulated by phosphorylation and confirm that it requires NTF2. NTF2 has two functions. First, it mediates the facilitated translocation of RanGDP through NPCs. Although this is not an intrinsically directional process, the activities of other Raninteracting factors mean that this function of NTF2 acts to import RanGDP into the nucleus, in which RCC1, the RanGEF, is found (19Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Quimby B.B. Lamitina T. L'Hernault S.W. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28575-28582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Second, NTF2 interacts directly and specifically with the GDP-bound form of Ran and inhibits RCC1-mediated GDP release from Ran (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we reported NTF2 as a RanGDP dissociation inhibitor or RanGDI (21Yamada M. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1339-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the mechanism of release of NTF2 from RanGDP. The fact that in vitro NTF2 binds RanGDP tightly enough to inhibit RCC1-mediated nucleotide exchange on Ran suggested that a factor might exist that would help dissociate the RanGDP-NTF2 complex. We were able to detect such an activity in mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells extract. The activity functions in an ATP-dependent manner. We refer to this factor as a RanGDI (i.e. NTF2) displacement factor, or RanGDF for short, adopting the nomenclature from other small GTPase systems (e.g. Refs. 33Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and 34Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Hotta I. Takaishi K. Imamura H. Nakano K. Kodama A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3279-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ATP-dependent RanGDF activity is not specific for mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, since a similar activity was detected in fractions prepared from HeLa cells (data not shown). By a combination of methods, we were able to demonstrate that the ATP-dependent activity is distinct from endogenous RCC1, and that it requires NTF2. This suggests a possible mode of action for the RanGDF, to accelerate dissociation of RanGDP from NTF2 and thus to make RanGDP more readily available for RCC1-mediated nucleotide exchange. It has been proposed that the transfer of RanGDP from NTF2 to RCC1 might happen either at the NPC or in the nucleoplasm (35Kunzler M. Hurt E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3233-3241PubMed Google Scholar). NTF2 has been shown to bind to both RanGDP and XFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins, such as yeast Nsp1p and vertebrate p62 (17Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 23Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using the crystal structure of rat NTF2 in complex with RanGDP, Bayliss et al. (27Bayliss R. Ribbeck K. Akin D. Kent H.M. Feldherr C.M. Görlich D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) designed an NTF2 mutant, W7A, in which the affinity for XFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins is reduced but which retains wild-type binding to RanGDP. It was possible that an XFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporin, like p62, might be the RanGDF. However, GDF activity levels measured in the presence of the W7A mutant and wild-type NTF2, either alone or in the presence of SP200 (which does not contain endogenous NTF2 but which does contain the RanGDF), were identical (Figs. 1A and 3B). In addition, we prepared recombinant p62 and assayed its effect in the filter-binding assay. p62 did not affect [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran pretreated with wild-type NTF2 either in the presence or absence of ATP (data not shown). It has also been reported (36Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) that the nucleoporin Nup153, which is located on the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC, is a RanGDP-binding protein. The zinc-finger region of Nup153 mediates interaction between RanGDP and Nup153 (36Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We therefore prepared the zinc-finger domain of Nup153 in recombinant form. It, however, had no effect on [3H]GDP dissociation from Ran prebound to wild-type NTF2 (data not shown). Our preliminary data therefore suggest that neither p62 nor Nup153 functions as a RanGDF. Another candidate that interacts genetically with both Ran and NTF2 is MOG1. The temperature-sensitive phenotype caused by deletion of MOG1 from yeast was suppressed by over-expression of NTF2 (37Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although both Ntf2p and Mog1p are required for optimal nuclear protein import in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, over-expression of MOG1 does not rescue ntf2 mutants, indicating that the functions of the two proteins are distinct. Stewart and Baker (38Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have determined the crystal structure of Mog1p to 1.9 Å resolution and have suggested that Mog1p interacts with Ran through a site similar to that bound by NTF2. We therefore investigated whether Mog1 could function as a RanGDF using recombinant mouse Mog1 protein. However, there was no detectable effect of Mog1 on the RanGDI activity of NTF2 (data not shown). Our attempts to further purify the RanGDF have not met with success. Although further purification was sometimes achieved, this was not reproducibly the case. In addition, we failed to identify any protein bands within fractions separated by SDS-PAGE for which the presence was correlated with GDF activity. If, as our results suggest, a component of the RanGDF activity acts catalytically, as a kinase, the GDF may be present in active fractions in extremely small quantities. In any event, as summarized above, we have been unable to identify the GDF either by directed approaches or by further biochemical fractionation. Finally, we propose some possible models for RanGDF function (Fig. 8). A RanGDF might specifically bind to NTF2 (1Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) or to RanGDP (2Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and thereby dissociate the NTF2-RanGDP complex. In these models, RCC1 would interact with free RanGDP. There are two remaining formal possible modes of action for the activity. RanGDF might bind the NTF2-RanGDP complex and destabilize GDP binding to Ran directly (3Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in an NTF2-dependent manner, RanGDF could interact directly with RCC1 and enhance its catalytic activity (4Avis J.A. Clarke P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have not identified the ATP-dependent NTF2-releasing factor, the data presented provide the first evidence for the existence of a factor that releases RanGDP from NTF2. Our data further suggest that the function of the RanGDF is regulated by phosphorylation. Our future effort will be to continue the attempts to identify the factor and to characterize in detail its function in RanGTP-dependent processes.

The focus of this work is to dissect the roles of the carboxylate side chain of Asp274 in the Asp274–His32 dyad, where a short strong hydrogen bond (SSHB) was shown to exist based on NMR criteria. A regular hydrogen bond (HB) was observed in D274N, and no low field proton resonance was detected for D274E and D274A. Comparison of the activity of wild type, D274N, and D274A suggested that the regular HB contributes significantly (∼4 kcal/mol) to catalysis, whereas the SSHB contributes only an additional 2 kcal/mol. The mutant D274E displays high activity similar to wild type, suggesting that the negative charge is sufficient for the catalytic role of Asp274. To further support this interpretation and rule out possible contribution of regular HB or SSHB in D274E, we showed that the activity of D274G can be rescued by exogenous chloride ions to a level comparable with that of D274E. Comparison between different anions suggested that the ability of an anion to rescue the activity is due to the size and the charge of the anion not the property as a HB acceptor. In conclusion, a major fraction of the functional role of Asp274 in the Asp274–His32 dyad can be attributed to a negative charge (as in D274E and D274G-Cl–), and the SSHB in the wild type enzyme provides minimal contribution to catalysis.

These results represent novel insight for an Asp–His catalytic dyad and for the mechanism of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Metal-independent bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cs (PI-PLCs; EC 3.1.4.10) 1The abbreviations used are: PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; DHPC, diheptanolyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; H-bond, hydrogen bond; PI, phosphatidylinositol; sPLA2, secreted phospholipase A2; SSHB, short strong hydrogen bond; WT, wild type; HB, hydrogen bond; LBHB, low barrier hydrogen bond. catalyze the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (PI) to diacylglycerol and 1,2-cyclic inositol phosphate, as well as the subsequent hydrolysis of 1,2-cyclic inositol phosphate to inositol phosphate, a step that is 1000 times slower than the first one (1Volwerk J.J. Koke J.A. Wetherwax P.B. Griffith O.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 52: 237-241Google Scholar). Extensive mechanistic studies have led to the proposal of an elaborate mechanism involving a catalytic dyad Asp274–His32 and a novel catalytic triad His82–Asp33–Arg69, as summarized in Fig. 1. In this mechanism, the three residues in the triad function together to activate the phosphate group and protonate the leaving group in a highly cooperative manner, as established by the extensive use of mutagenesis and the study of thio effects. Several other studies have suggested that the function of the dyad Asp274–His32 is to serve as the general base (2Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Google Scholar, 3Gassler C.S. Ryan M. Liu T. Griffith O.H. Heinz D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12802-12813Google Scholar, 4Hondal R.J. Zhao Z. Kravchuk A.V. Liao H. Riddle S.R. Yue X. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4568-4580Google Scholar). The focus of this paper is to report our in-depth studies, which further dissect the roles of the dyad, as elaborated below: The three-dimensional structure of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC complexed with myo-inositol, a substrate analog, has been determined by x-ray crystallography (2Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Google Scholar). It was found that the Nϵ2 of His32 is optimally positioned (2.8 Å) for proton abstraction from the C2-hydroxyl group of myo-inositol, whereas its Nδ1 forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) (2.7 Å) with the Oδ1 of Asp274 (Fig. 2, left panel). A recent NMR study showed that the H-bond between Asp274 and His32 in the free enzyme fits into the NMR criteria for a short strong hydrogen bond (SSHB): a highly deshielded proton resonance, a bond length of 2.64 Å, a D/H fractionation factor significantly lower than 1.0, and a protection factor of >100 (5Ryan M. Liu T. Dahlquist F.W. Griffith O.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9743-9750Google Scholar). This type of H-bond has been postulated to play a crucial role in enzymatic reactions, particularly those involving the general acid/base catalytic mechanism, by providing substantial stabilization energy (10–20 kcal/mol) for the intermediate or transition state (6Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Google Scholar). However, we have shown that replacing Asp274 with an asparagine residue has a relatively mild effect (40-fold decrease) on catalysis (4Hondal R.J. Zhao Z. Kravchuk A.V. Liao H. Riddle S.R. Yue X. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4568-4580Google Scholar). In addition, x-ray structural analyses showed that the side chain of Asn274 in D274N is virtually unchanged when compared with Asp274 in WT, and Asn274 still forms a hydrogen bonding interaction with Nδ1 of His32 (3Gassler C.S. Ryan M. Liu T. Griffith O.H. Heinz D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12802-12813Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, right panel). These data led us to ask the following questions: (i) Does SSHB exist in mutants D274N and D274E and therefore account for the mild effect on catalysis? (ii) If the answer is no, what is the difference between a SSHB and a regular HB in their energetic contributions to catalysis? (iii) Can the role of Asp274 in the catalytic dyad be further dissected? Herein, we report the use of site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with 1H NMR spectroscopy and chemical rescue analyses to dissect the functional role of Asp274 in the catalytic dyad (Asp274–His32) of PI-PLC. Asp274 was substituted by asparagine, glutamate, alanine, and glycine. These mutant enzymes were analyzed by kinetic, NMR, and chemical rescue techniques. Our results suggest that the major functional role of Asp274 can be achieved by forming a regular HB (as in D274N) or by providing a negative charge (as in D274E and Cl– rescued D274G) and that the SSHB in the wild type enzyme provides only a modest additional contribution to catalysis. This work represents a novel insight for Asp–His catalytic dyads and for the mechanism of PI-PLC. Materials—Phosphatidylinositol from bovine liver and 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. l-α-[myo-Inositol-2-3H(N)]-phosphatidylinositol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 15NH4Cl (at 99% 15N) was from Isotech Inc. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The Escherichia coli strains XL1 Blue and BL21 (DE3) LysS used for gene manipulation and protein overexpression were from Stratagene. All DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs. 99.9% atom D2O was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Construction and Purification of WT and Mutant PI-PLC—Mutations were introduced by the double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers used are listed 5′ to 3′ with base substitutions underlined and codons of interest in italics. Only forward primer sequences are shown for each mutant oligonucleotide, and the mutation produced is in parentheses: 5′-C TGG GTA ATT CAA GAG TAC ATA AAT GAA AAG TG-3′ (D274E), 5′-C TGG GTA ATT CAA AAC TAC ATA AAT GAA AAG TG-3′ (D274N). 5′-C TGG GTA ATT CAA GGC TAC ATA AAT GAA AAG TG-3′ (D274G), and 5′-CTT TTC ATT TAT GTA AGC TTG AAT TAC CCA G-3′ (D274A). All of the mutations were verified by sequencing. All of the proteins were purified as described previously (4Hondal R.J. Zhao Z. Kravchuk A.V. Liao H. Riddle S.R. Yue X. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4568-4580Google Scholar, 7Hondal R.J. Riddle S.R. Kravchuk A.V. Zhao Z. Liao H. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6633-6642Google Scholar). NMR Methods—One-dimensional 1H NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DMX-600 spectrometer at 280 K using a jump-return sequence for solvent suppression (8Plateau P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Google Scholar). The NMR samples contained ∼0.5 mm protein. Unless otherwise stated, lyophilized protein was prepared in 90% H2O, 10% D2O with 20 mm Tris/maleic buffer at pH 4.0–9.0. To determine the pKa of His32 in both WT and mutant PI-PLC, one-dimensional 1H NMR experiments were conducted on PI-PLC samples upon pH titration (pH 5.0–9.0). Care was taken to minimize the loss of sample, and less than 10% volume changes were introduced. Activity Assay of PI-PLC with [3H]PI Substrate—The specific activities of mutants were measured according to the procedure reported earlier (9Kravchuk A.V. Zhao L. Kubiak R.J. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5433-5439Google Scholar) with minor modifications. l-α-[myo-Inositol-2-3H(N)]-phosphatidylinositol was mixed with unlabeled PI from bovine liver to obtain an overall PI concentration of 5 mm and a specific activity of ∼1.25 × 106 cpm/mol. In the pH dependence study, the reaction mixture contained 2 mm PI, 8 mm DHPC, 20 mm succinate (pKa = 4.2), 20 mm HEPES (pKa = 7.48), and 20 mm borate (pKa = 9.23), where the pH of the buffer was adjusted solely by NaOH to avoid introduction of chloride ions. Both pH adjustment and assays were performed at 25 °C. In the anion activation study, the reaction mixture contains 2 mm PI, 8 mm DHPC, 0–1 m NaX, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, where the pH of the buffer was adjusted solely by NaOH to avoid introduction of chloride ions (X stands for different anions tested in this studies: F–, Cl–, Br–, N3−, COO–, and Ac–). The assays were performed at 37 °C. Because of the low solubility of NaF (4.22 g/100 ml of H2O), 0–400 mm NaF was used in the F– activation study. An aliquot of 20 μl of PI-PLC solution was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min. The concentrations of enzymes were adjusted so that the substrate conversion does not exceed 10–30%. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH:HCl (66:33:1). The phases were separated by a brief centrifugation, and radioactivity of 50 μl of the aqueous phase was measured by scintillation counting (Beckman). Enzymatic activity was expressed in μmol × min–1 × (mg of enzyme)–1 or units/mg. Proton NMR Evidence for SSHB in WT and Normal HB in D274N Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC—A low field proton peak at 16.3 ppm at low pH (<6) that arose from Hδ1 of His32 has been observed for the WT but not for the mutant D274A B. cereus PI-PLC (5Ryan M. Liu T. Dahlquist F.W. Griffith O.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9743-9750Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, we were able to observe the same characteristic low field chemical shift of the SSHB proton at 16.3 ppm for the WT B. thuringiensis PI-PLC (Fig. 3B). Note that the amino acid sequence of B. thuringiensis PI-PLC is identical to that of B. cereus PI-PLC, except at eight nonconservative positions (1Volwerk J.J. Koke J.A. Wetherwax P.B. Griffith O.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 52: 237-241Google Scholar). Therefore, we did not further acquire other experimental parameters (D/H fractionation and factor protection factor) used as NMR criteria for assigning the SSHB between Nδ1 of His32 and Oδ1 of Asp274. However, we did perform a decoupling experiment to confirm that this proton is attached to nitrogen. In short, when uniformly 15N-labeled WT enzyme was used, a low field (16.3 ppm) splitting proton peak was observed for WT (Fig. 3A). The J-coupling is estimated to be ∼90 Hz, suggesting that this peak arises from the nitrogen-attached proton. The 15N chemical shift was determined to be 180 ± 10 ppm by a series of continuous wave decoupling experiments (spectra not shown). This 15N chemical shift value is close to the typical value for a = NH+ in model compounds (∼175 ppm) (10Bachovchin W.W. Mag. Reson. Chem. 2001; 39: S199-S213Google Scholar, 11Halkides C.J. Wu Y.Q. Murray C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15941-15948Google Scholar), suggesting that His32 is largely positively charged. The protonation state of His32 at pH 5.0 is consistent with its pKa value described in the next section. Under the same conditions, we found that this low field proton peak shifted to 13.6 ppm in D274N (Fig. 3C) and was missing in D274E (Fig. 3D). The crystal structures of WT and D274N have been determined at resolutions of 2.6 and 2.3 Å, respectively. The H-bond distance between Nδ1 of His32 and Oδ1 of Asp274 in the WT was estimated to be 2.7 Å, and the distance between Nδ1 of His32 and Oδ1 of Asn274 in the D274N mutant is estimated to be 2.5 Å (3Gassler C.S. Ryan M. Liu T. Griffith O.H. Heinz D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12802-12813Google Scholar). However, x-ray crystallographic results at a resolution of 2.3–2.6 Å are insufficient to distinguish between small changes in bond distances. On the basis of the NMR data, a SSHB exists between Asp274 and His32 in the WT enzyme, whereas a normal double-well H-bond forms between Asn274 and His32 in the D274N mutant. It should be noted that in the absence of structural information the negative result for D274E should not preclude a possible H-bond interaction (SSHB or regular HB) between Glu274 and His32. However, we will address this question through functional studies in the subsequent sections. Extensive studies and debates have appeared in the literature since the idea of low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB or SSHB) was first proposed (12Shan S.-O. Loh S. Herschlag D. Science. 1996; 272: 97-101Google Scholar, 13Ash E.L. Sudmeier J.L. De Fabo E.C. Bachovchin W.W. Science. 1997; 278: 1128-1132Google Scholar, 14Gerlt J.A. Kreevoy M.M. Cleland W.W. Frey P.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 259-267Google Scholar, 15Tobin J.B. Whitt S.A. Cassidy C.S. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6919-6924Google Scholar). Two of the key questions are the strength of the LBHB and its contribution to the rate enhancement of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. To address these issues for the SSHB in PI-PLC, we performed pH dependence studies on the hydrogen bonding and the catalytic activity of both WT and D274N. The different properties of the two mutants provide insight to these issues. pH Dependence of the Low Field Proton Resonance of D274N and WT PI-PLC—We examined the effects of pH on these low field proton peaks. The results from the pH titration of WT and D274N are shown in Fig. 4. For WT, the low field proton peak shifted from 16.3 ppm at pH 6.0 to 13.8 ppm at pH 9.0, and the calculated pKa is 7.4 at 7 °C (Fig. 5A). 2The pKa value of His32 in B. cereus PI-PLC derived from 1H NMR studies by Ryan et al. (5Ryan M. Liu T. Dahlquist F.W. Griffith O.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9743-9750Google Scholar) is 8.0 at 6 °C. The difference between the pKa values could be due to various causes including the experimental conditions. Because the pKa difference between WT and D274N is our major focus, this small discrepancy was not further emphasized. For D274N, the low field proton peak shifted from 13.5 ppm at pH 5.0 to 11.5 ppm at pH 8.0, and the calculated pKa is 6.4 at 7 °C. This result shows that the D274N mutation leads to a 1-pH unit decrease in the pKa of His32, which can be explained by the perception that the negatively charged carboxyl oxygen can better stabilize the positively charged imidazole ring.Fig. 5Comparison of the Asp–His catalytic dyad in PI-PLC and Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad in chymotrypsin.A, the free PI-PLC in which the Asp274–His32 dyad is protonated. B, the free chymotrypsin in which Asp102–His57 is protonated. C, the peptidyl adducts formed between Ser195 and trifluoro ketone (N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanyltrifluoromethyl ketone) in which the dyad is protonated. The chemical shifts for the SSHBs and information about the pKa values for the His residues from this and previous studies (17Cassidy C.S. Lin J. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4576-4584Google Scholar) are included.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Similarly, the LBHB exists in the protonated dyad His57–Asp102 of the free chymotrypsin, and the pKa of His57 was reported to be 7.5 at 3 °C (16Robillard G. Shulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 507-511Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 5B. However, pKa of His57 of chymotrypsin increases by ∼5 pKa units when complexed with transition state analogs (Fig. 5C), which indicates that the LBHB strengthens in the transition state complex (17Cassidy C.S. Lin J. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4576-4584Google Scholar). Although no transition state analog for PI-PLC catalysis is available to test this property, it is likely that the SSHB in the protonated dyad His32–Asp274 further strengthens in the transition state complex. The strength of the SSHB in the transition state of PI-PLC is not known. However, its contribution to catalysis can be estimated by comparing the activities of WT and D274N as described in the next section. The SSHB of PI-PLC Contributes Only Modestly to Catalysis—Kinetic data obtained previously (4Hondal R.J. Zhao Z. Kravchuk A.V. Liao H. Riddle S.R. Yue X. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4568-4580Google Scholar), show that the activity of D274N (21.0 units/mg) is only modestly reduced relative to that of WT PI-PLC (1300 units/mg). However, previous studies were performed at a fixed pH of 7.5. Because WT and the mutant showed different pH dependence in hydrogen bonding as described in the preceding section, it is likely that their activities have different pH optima. Here, we constructed the pH activity profiles for WT, D274N, and D274E PI-PLC (Fig. 6). The apparent pKa values of the general base obtained from the equation in the Fig. 6 legend are 4.91 ± 0.07 (WT), 3.98 ± 0.02 (D274N), and 4.67 ± 0.17 (D274E). Thus the D274N mutation lowers the apparent pKa value by 1 pH unit, whereas the D274E mutation does not affect the apparent pKa value (within the error range). Although the trend seems to be consistent with that from the NMR study, the exact values do not match. The apparent pKa values derived from pH activity profiles may not be a true reflection of the pKa values of His32 (in the enzyme-substrate complex), possibly because of the complexity of the ionizable catalytic residues around the active site as well as the stability of the protein as a function of pH. Under the optimal pH conditions, the Vmax values are 1345 ± 86 units/mg (WT), 33.3 ± 2.1 units/mg (D274N), and 446 ± 85 units/mg (D274E). Previously, WT and a series of mutant PI-PLC enzymes were shown to display the same Rp thio effect (kO/kRp) using 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophospho-1-myo-inositol as the substrate and DHPC as the detergent, suggesting that the chemistry step is rate-limiting under the assay conditions (9Kravchuk A.V. Zhao L. Kubiak R.J. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5433-5439Google Scholar, 18Kubiak R.J. Yue X. Hondal R.J. Mihai C. Tsai M.D. Bruzik K.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5422-5432Google Scholar). If the rate is limited by micelle exchanges, the thio effect should increase as the chemical step slows in the mutant. Thus the 40-fold decrease in activity caused by the D274N mutation corresponds to 2.0 kcal/mol energy loss in transition state stabilization (ΔG‡WT – ΔG‡D274N = RTln (kD274N/kWT) = 2.0 kcal/mol). This indicates that the contribution of the SSHB (relative to the normal HB) to catalysis is relatively small in comparison with that of serine proteases. The results of D274E and D274A are more difficult to interpret because their structures are not available. Although the D274A mutant retains only 0.005% of activity relative to that of WT (4Hondal R.J. Zhao Z. Kravchuk A.V. Liao H. Riddle S.R. Yue X. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4568-4580Google Scholar), D274E retains nearly 50% of the WT activity as indicated above. The significant loss of activity in D274A can be attributed to the loss of the SSHB and the negative charge. However, it is unclear whether the nearly complete retention of activity for D274E is contributed by the negative charge alone or by the regular HB and/or SSHB. As stated earlier, the absence of low field proton resonance does not necessarily mean the absence of a hydrogen bond. This issue is addressed in the next section. Dissecting the Roles of the H-bond and the Negative Charge of Asp274—To further dissect the roles of the H-bond and the negative charge, we performed anion rescue experiments. The rationale is to introduce anions that can provide negative charge but not hydrogen bonding. Asp274 in PI-PLC was first changed to alanine and glycine by the site-directed mutagenesis. The activities of the two cavity mutants (D274A and D274G) were tested in the presence of different anions (data not shown). The activity levels of D274A and D274G in the absence of rescuing anions at pH 7.5 were 0.033 ± 0.001 and 0.19 ± 0.03 units/mg, respectively. D274G, but not D274A, showed enhanced activity in the presence of exogenous anions. Further analyses demonstrated that the enhanced activity of D274G by these anions obeys saturation kinetics with respect to the anion concentration (Fig. 7). The magnitude of D274G activation by different anions is summarized in Table I. The maximal velocities of D274G in the presence of NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaN3, NaCOO, and NaAc at saturating substrate concentrations give a 13-, 67-, 54-, 71-, 24-, and 4-fold activation, respectively. Although the high Kappd values indicate the low binding affinity of D274G toward those exogenous anions, this is the first example in which a mutated Asp/His catalytic dyad is rescued by halide ions. The identical activation effect from NaCl and KCl suggests that counter cations have no effect on the rescued activity.Table IKinetic parameters of D274G PI-PLC by different anionsAnions testedVmaxKdappMolecular volumeaSolvent-excluded molecular volumes were calculated based on the Monte Carlo method, using Gaussian.μmol min-1 mg-1mmÅ3None0.19 ± 0.03F-2.39 ± 0.34575 ± 14628.20Cl- (as in KCl)12.7 ± 0.366.2 ± 7.134.24Cl- (as in NaCl)12.9 ± 0.366.4 ± 5.234.24Br-10.2 ± 0.3115 ± 1335.62N3-13.5 ± 0.352.8 ± 4.757.62HCOO-4.52 ± 0.27434 ± 8374.99CH3COO-0.73 ± 0.4193.18a Solvent-excluded molecular volumes were calculated based on the Monte Carlo method, using Gaussian. Open table in a new tab Shown in Fig. 8 is a plot of log (Vmax) versus solvent-excluded molecular volume for N–3 (pKa = 4.72), COO– (pKa = 3.751), and Ac– (pKa = 4.756). Although the pKa values of these chemicals vary, the plot shows a good linear relation (log k = (–0.0394 ± 0.0060 Å–3) × V (molecular volume Å3) + (3.45 ± 0.46)). This indicates that the steric factor is very important in determining rate constants for the anion rescued activity. Upon input of the log (Vmax) values of Cl– and Br– activation, we found that the experimental values were below theoretical predications. In addition, the Kappd values for Cl– and Br– activation are larger than that for N–3 activation. These data hint that the bound form of Cl– and Br– might be hydrated. Although F– is the smallest halide ion, it activates D274G to the least extent with a Kappd value of 575 ± 146 mm. A possible explanation is that F– forms big anionic clusters in aqueous solution because of the strong binding energy (23.3 kcal/mol) in the F–·H2O complex (19Yates B.F. Schaefer H.F.I. Lee T.J. Rice J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6327-6332Google Scholar). To explain at the chemical level the activation of D274G, but not D274A, by the exogenous anions, there are several mechanisms envisaged. (i) The cavity generated by D274A is small and hydrophobic, thus excluding water or anions from binding. In contrast, the cavity generated by D274G is large and hydrophilic, and water and anions can bind to this cavity. This bound water may account for the 6-fold higher activity demonstrated by D274G in the absence of rescuing anions. (ii) Cl– (pKa =–9) is very unlikely to be able to operate efficiently as a proton acceptor at pH 7.5, whereas N–3 (pKa = 4.72) might. Here, we showed that Cl–, like N–3, is capable of rescuing the activity of D274G by ∼70-fold. Therefore, it seems probable that a small anion, by implication the side chain of Asp274, offers a fixed negative charge in the active site. On the other hand, if the rescue by N–3 is attributed to its ability in accepting a proton, we would expect a higher activation by N–3 compared with that of Cl– at lower pH. This possibility is examined in the next section. pH Activity Dependence of the Rescue Effects of D274G by Cl–and N–3—Although the D274G can be successfully activated by exogenous anions, the maximal activity at the assay condition (pH 7.5) is still 3-fold lower than that of D274N and 60-fold lower than that of D274E. It is possible that the pH optimum of D274G has changed, thus maximal activities were not observed. To test this possibility and the role of N–3 (stated above), we examined the dependence of activity on the pH. As shown in Fig. 9, the pH activity profiles of D274G in the absence and presence of rescuing ions are both bell-shaped curves. The pH optimum changes from pH 5.0 to 6.0 in the presence of Cl– (or to pH 5.6 in the presence of N–3). This suggests that the general base in the Michaelis complex functions more efficiently at a higher pH in the presence of rescuing anions. It is striking that the activity of D274G at optimal pH increases from 1.75 to 100 units/mg in the presence of Cl– (98 units/mg in the presence of N3−). Note that this rescued activity of D274G (100 units/mg) is 3-fold higher than that of D274N (33 units/mg). As controls, the pH dependence of D274N, D274E, and WT in the presence of 1 m Cl– were examined. Within experimental errors, the activities of D274N and D274E are not affected by Cl–, and the pH profiles remain the same. For WT, the activities generally increased by ∼2–3-fold and the pH optimum became 7–8 instead of 6–9 in the presence of 1 m Cl–. Taken together, these findings suggest that anions with small radii can bind D274G by occupying the cavity created by the aspartate to glycine mutation and consequently stabilize the positive charge on the general base (His32) through electrostatic interaction (lacking directionality) and activate D274G. These findings also infer that Asp274 may play a trivial role in orienting the His32 side chain to abstract proton from the 2-OH from the inositol ring. We are not aware of any previous examples of a halide ion substituting for a carboxylate side chain in Asp/His dyad. This pattern suggests strongly that the role of Asp274 is a source of fixed charge rather than a proton acceptor in the catalysis by PI-PLC. Thus our results provide another clear example that the “charge relay mechanism” (20Blow D.M. Birktoft J.J. Hartley B.S. Nature. 1969; 221: 337-340Google Scholar, 21Hunkapiller M.W. Smallcombe S.H. Whitaker D.R. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4732-4743Google Scholar), which was proposed for catalytic dyad/triad in the past, is not operative for the Asp274–His32 dyad. Comparison with Serine Proteases and sPLA2—Both the NMR behavior and the structural conservation strongly suggest that the hydrogen bonding of Asp274–His32 in PI-PLC is closely related to the catalytic triad of serine proteases and catalytic triads/dyads in a growing list of other enzymes (5Ryan M. Liu T. Dahlquist F.W. Griffith O.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9743-9750Google Scholar). What are the differences between the Asp–His dyad in PI-PLC and that in the classic serine proteases? Previously, the contribution of LBHB in serine proteases to catalysis was often estimated from the decrease in kcat/Km (by a factor of ∼104) when the active site Asp was mutated to Asn (22Craik C.S. Largman C. Fletcher T. Roczniak S. Barr P.J. Fletterick R. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 228: 291-297Google Scholar, 23Corey D.R. Craik C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1784-1790Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that this loss cannot be attributed entirely to the loss of LBHB, for the tautomeric form of the His residue is reversed in the D102N mutant of trypsin (24Sprang S. Standing T. Fletterick R.J. Stroud R.M. Finer-Moore J. Xuong N.H. Hamlin R. Rutter W.J. Craik C.S. Science. 1987; 237: 905-909Google Scholar). A substantial fraction of the loss of activity is likely caused by the change in the tautomeric form of the histidine residue. Consistent with this interpretation, a recent study has shown that the LBHB (Asp32–His64) of subtilisin Bacillus protease N′ can be partially (2%) replaced by a normal strength hydrogen bond (Cys32–His64) of mutant enzyme D32C (25Stratton J.R. Pelton J.G. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10411-10416Google Scholar). For bovine pancreatic secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), the Asp99–His48 dyad functions similarly to the Asp274–His32 dyad of PI-PLC. A significant difference resides in the tautomeric form of the imidazole ring (in sPLA2, Asp99 H-bonds to the Nϵ2 of His48, whereas in PI-PLC, Asp274 H-bonds to the Nδ1 of His32) (26Noel J.P. Bingman C.A. Deng T.L. Dupureur C.M. Hamilton K.J. Jiang R.T. Kwak J.G. Sekharudu C. Sundaralingam M. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11801-11811Google Scholar). Unlike PI-PLC and serine proteases, the SSHB in PLA2 exists between the Nδ1 of His48 and one of the nonbridging phosphonate oxygen atoms in the transition state analog, whereas a normal H-bond is formed between the Nϵ2 of His48 and the Oδ1 of Asp99 at low pH or in the presence of the transition state analog (HK32). Similar to that has been observed for the mutant D274N PI-PLC, both the x-ray crystal structure and NMR experimental results suggest that a regular HB exists between Asn99 and protonated His48 in the D99N mutant of sPLA2, and D99N still preserves 5% of the catalytic activity compared with that of WT (27Kumar A. Sekharudu C. Ramakrishnan B. Dupureur C.M. Zhu H. Tsai M.D. Sundaralingam M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2082-2088Google Scholar, 28Poi M.J. Tomaszewski J.W. Yuan C. Dunlap C.A. Andersen N.H. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 997-1009Google Scholar). Conclusion—The detailed catalytic roles of the Asp–His catalytic dyad (or Asp–His–Ser triad) and the SSHB in this motif are subjects of active research and intense debate. Combination of detailed structural and enzymological analyses has allowed us to address this issue in depth for sPLA2 previously and for PI-PLC in this work. Although there may be multiple functional roles for a particular structural element, our results with PI-PLC suggest that a glycine residue along with a chloride ion, in the absence of a regular HB or a SSHB, suffice nearly the entire role of the aspartate residue in the Asp274–His32 dyad where a SSHB exists. The WT enzyme still does better overall in catalyzing the reaction and likely also in other factors, such as protein stability and substrate binding. However, dissection of the functional roles described here provides new insight into the structure-function relationship of enzymes.
