https://openalex.org/W2426081542,"Ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is an iron export protein found in mammals. FPN1 is important for the export of iron across the basolateral membrane of absorptive enterocytes and across the plasma membrane of macrophages. The expression of FPN1 is regulated by hepcidin, which binds to FPN1 and then induces its degradation. Previously, we demonstrated that divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) interacts with the intracellular iron chaperone protein poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2). Subsequently, PCBP2 receives iron from DMT1 and then disengages from the transporter. In this study, we investigated the function of PCBP2 in iron export. Mammalian genomes encode four PCBPs (i.e. PCBP1–4). Here, for the first time, we demonstrated using both yeast and mammalian cells that PCBP2, but not PCBP1, PCBP3, or PCBP4, binds with FPN1. Importantly, iron-loaded, but not iron-depleted, PCBP2 interacts with FPN1. The PCBP2-binding domain of FPN1 was identified in its C-terminal cytoplasmic region. The silencing of PCBP2 expression suppressed FPN1-dependent iron export from cells. These results suggest that FPN1 exports iron received from the iron chaperone PCBP2. Therefore, it was found that PCBP2 modulates cellular iron export, which is an important physiological process. Ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is an iron export protein found in mammals.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10775-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to readily accept or donate electrons, iron is a valuable cofactor that is used in oxygen transport, electron transfer, and DNA synthesis (2Netz D.J. Stith C.M. Stümpfig M.

However, iron is potentially toxic because it catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen species. The ensuing oxidative stress is associated with damage to cellular molecules, injury to tissues, and disease via processes including hydroxyl radical formation, glutathione depletion, protein aggregation, lipid peroxidation, and nucleic acid modification (4Wolozin B.

Despite its high abundance in nature, ferric iron is poorly bioavailable due to its exceedingly low solubility at physiological pH. Thus, the acquisition and usage of iron presents a considerable challenge to cells and organisms, which have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to satisfy their metabolic needs and concomitantly minimize the risk of toxicity. It has long been known that there is very little, yet potentially toxic, low-molecular-weight iron in rapidly metabolizing cells (6Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Vyoral D. Distribution of iron in reticulocytes after inhibition of heme synthesis with succinylacetone: examination of the intermediates involved in iron metabolism.Blood. 1996; 87: 3477-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in intracellular iron transport have remained elusive (7Richardson D.R. Ponka P. The molecular mechanisms of the metabolism and transport of iron in normal and neoplastic cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Recently, it was revealed that one of the mechanisms of iron transport and metabolism involves intracellular chaperone proteins (8Philpott C.C.

It was reported that poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), 3The abbreviations used are: PCBPpoly(rC)-binding proteinKHK-homologyDMTdivalent metal transporterTftransferrinTBItransferrin-bound ironNTBInon-Tf-bound ironFPN1ferroportin 1ERendoplasmic reticulumCPRcytochrome P450 reductaseFACferric ammonium citrateCDTA1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acidPDIprotein disulfide isomerasepAbpolyclonal antibodyFe-NTAferric nitrilotriacetate. also referred to as α-CP1 or hnRNP E1, is a cytosolic iron chaperone protein that delivers iron to ferritin (9Shi H.

PCBP1 binds to iron with micromolar affinity at a molar ratio of 3:1 Fe:PCBP1. Notably, PCBP1 has been shown previously to function as an RNA- and DNA-binding protein and has been identified as a member of a family of four homologous proteins containing three heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K-homology (KH) domains (10Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Characterisation of two major cellular poly(rC)-binding human proteins, each containing three K-homologous (KH) domains.Eur. J.

Mammalian genomes encode four PCBPs, and every PCBP has been found to exhibit iron chaperone activity (11Leidgens S. Bullough K.Z. Shi H. Li F. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Yabe T. Subramanian P. Hsu E. Natarajan N. Nandal A. Stemmler T.L. Philpott C.C. Each member of the poly-r(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP) family exhibits iron chaperone activity toward ferritin.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17791-17802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PCBP1 is an intronless gene (12Makeyev A.V. Chkheidze A.N. Liebhaber S.A. A set of highly conserved RNA-binding proteins, αCP-1 and αCP-2, implicated in mRNA stabilization, are coexpressed from an intronless gene and its intron-containing paralog.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24849-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that likely arose from the retrotransposition of a splice variant of PCBP2 mRNA. This became fixed in the genome, probably because the associated gene product performed a unique function not shared by the other PCBPs (13Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. The poly(C)-binding proteins: a multiplicity of functions and a search for mechanisms.RNA. 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The other members of the PCBP gene family undergo alternative splicing that results in greater diversity in the expression of PCBPs in mammals (13Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. The poly(C)-binding proteins: a multiplicity of functions and a search for mechanisms.RNA. 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). PCBP1 is specific to mammals, whereas PCBP2, PCBP3, and PCBP4 are present throughout vertebrates, flies, and worms (8Philpott C.C. Coming into view: eukaryotic iron chaperones and intracellular iron delivery.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that PCBP2, but not PCBP1, binds to the transmembrane iron importer, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) (14Yanatori I. Yasui Y. Tabuchi M. Kishi F. Chaperone protein involved in transmembrane transport of iron.Biochem. J. 2014; 462: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DMT1 has four isoforms, each of which exhibits specific subcellular localizations, namely in the plasma membrane (DMT1A-I), recycling endosomes (DMT1A-II and DMT1B-II), and/or late endosomes/lysosomes (DMT1B-I) (15Canonne-Hergaux F.

Tabuchi M. Kawai Y. Yasui Y. Akagi R. Kishi F. Heme and non-heme iron transporters in non-polarized and polarized cells.BMC Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PCBP2 receives iron directly from all four DMT1 isoforms (14Yanatori I. Yasui Y. Tabuchi M. Kishi F. Chaperone protein involved in transmembrane transport of iron.Biochem. J. 2014; 462: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Iron-loaded DMT1 binds to iron-depleted PCBP2, whereas iron-chelated DMT1 cannot (14Yanatori I. Yasui Y. Tabuchi M. Kishi F. Chaperone protein involved in transmembrane transport of iron.Biochem. J. 2014; 462: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Iron uptake into the cytoplasm in the form of either non-transferrin (Tf)-bound iron (NTBI) or Tf-bound iron (TBI) was dependent on both DMT1 and PCBP2 (14Yanatori I. Yasui Y. Tabuchi M. Kishi F. Chaperone protein involved in transmembrane transport of iron.Biochem. J. 2014; 462: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that PCBP2 might act as a “gateway keeper” for iron transport (19Lane D.J. Richardson D.R. Chaperone turns gatekeeper: PCBP2 and DMT1 form an iron-transport pipeline.Biochem. J. 2014; 462: e1-e3Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is an important cellular iron exporter, which is found on the plasma membranes of certain types of cells, especially duodenal enterocytes and macrophages (20Abboud S. Haile D.J.

Cell. 2000; 5: 299-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). One of the DMT1 isoforms is expressed specifically on the apical membrane of duodenal enterocytes (18Yanatori I. Tabuchi M. Kawai Y. Yasui Y. Akagi R. Kishi F. Heme and non-heme iron transporters in non-polarized and polarized cells.BMC Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas FPN1 is expressed on the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes (22McKie A.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7811-7819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). The major molecular target of hepcidin is FPN1, which transfers cellular iron to the plasma (26Drakesmith H. Nemeth E. Ganz T. Ironing out ferroportin.Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Hepcidin binds to the extracellular loop of FPN1, and this binding induces the endocytosis and proteolysis of FPN1, leading to a decrease in the export of iron to the plasma (27Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Hepcidin regulates cellular iron efflux by binding to ferroportin and inducing its internalization.Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3620) Google Scholar). This hepcidin-FPN1 binding interaction is an essential mechanism for the regulation of body iron stores; it is not yet clear how FPN1 receives cytoplasmic iron to export it from cells. However, the process of iron release is crucial to the regulation of systemic iron metabolism (28Ganz T. Systemic iron homeostasis.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1721-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 29Kalinowski D.S. Stefani C. Toyokuni S. Ganz T. Anderson G.J. Subramaniam N.V. Trinder D. Olynyk J.K. Chua A. Jansson P.J.

Acta. 2016; 1863: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a novel function of PCBP2 as an iron chaperone. We demonstrated that the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of FPN1 interacts specifically with PCBP2 but not with PCBP1, PCBP3, or PCBP4. We also determined that iron-depleted FPN1 interacts with iron-loaded PCBP2 but not with iron-depleted PCBP2. Silencing PCBP2 expression suppressed the iron export activity of FPN1. In addition, we showed that DMT1 binds to PCBP2 but not PCBP1, PCBP3, or PCBP4. This observation indicates that the interaction of DMT1 with these candidate iron chaperone proteins is highly specific to PCBP2. All four PCBPs exhibit iron binding activity, and their target molecules could potentially be different. The results of our study suggest that PCBP2 has important functions in both iron import and export and serves as a gateway keeper for the safe transport of iron. Our previous study showed that PCBP2 was identified as a binding partner of DMT1 using the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of DMT1 as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening (18Yanatori I. Tabuchi M. Kawai Y. Yasui Y. Akagi R. Kishi F. Heme and non-heme iron transporters in non-polarized and polarized cells.BMC Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). FPN1 contains three major cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 1A): an N-terminal region (FPN1-N; amino acids 1–22), an intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane regions (FPN1-M; amino acids 220–307) and a C-terminal region (FPN1-C; amino acids 534–572) (30Wallace D.F.

Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C75-C84Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that one of these regions might function as a PCBP-binding domain. To assess this possibility, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using these three regions of FPN1 as bait (Fig. 1). The PCBP family was reported to include four paralogues, PCBP1–4 (13Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. The poly(C)-binding proteins: a multiplicity of functions and a search for mechanisms.RNA. 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). All members of the PCBP family contain three KH domains (i.e. KH1, KH2, and KH3 (Fig. 1A)) and exhibit iron chaperone activity by binding to iron (11Leidgens S. Bullough K.Z. Shi H. Li F. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Yabe T. Subramanian P. Hsu E. Natarajan N. Nandal A. Stemmler T.L. Philpott C.C.

Chem. 2013; 288: 17791-17802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). PCBP2 displays 83, 71, and 53% amino acid sequence similarity with PCBP1, PCBP3, and PCBP4, respectively (11Leidgens S. Bullough K.Z. Shi H. Li F. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Yabe T. Subramanian P. Hsu E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24849-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, the full-length form of PCBP1 (amino acids 1–356, I-F) or PCBP2 (amino acids 1–366, II-F) was cloned into the prey vector and used for the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1A). We also cloned the full-length form of PCBP3 (amino acids 1–371, III-F) and PCBP4 (amino acids 1–403, IV-F) and made the recombinant yeast prey vectors in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1A). However, when we transformed the yeast with the prey vectors containing full-length PCBP3 or PCBP4, recombinant yeast clones could not be grown on selection plates. We repeatedly tried to isolate the recombinant yeast clones but were not successful. Hence, it was presumed that PCBP3 and PCBP4 in the prey vector were toxic for yeast cells. To identify which domain of PCBPs are functional for binding to FPN1 in yeast cells, each KH domain was cloned into the prey vector (Fig. 1A). This included the KH1 domains of PCBP1 (amino acids 12–80, I-1), PCBP2 (amino acids 12–80, II-1), PCBP3 (amino acids 44–112, III-1), and PCBP4 (amino acids 16–84, IV-1); the KH2 domains of PCBP1 (amino acids 94–193, I-2), PCBP2 (amino acids 94–192, II-2), PCBP3 (amino acids 126–220, III-2), and PCBP4 (amino acids 98–192, IV-2); and the KH3 domains of PCBP1 (amino acids 278–348, I-3), PCBP2 (amino acids 285–357, II-3), PCBP3 (amino acids 292–362, III-3), and PCBP4 (amino acids 240–310, IV-3) (Fig. 1A). As an appropriate positive control, P53 was used as bait and SV40-T implemented as prey, as this protein-protein interaction is well characterized (31Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. The two-hybrid system: a method to identify and clone genes for proteins that interact with a protein of interest.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of recombinant proteins and assess whether each of them was expressed at their expected molecular weight in yeast cells, whole yeast protein was extracted and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). The expected molecular sizes of the bait fusion proteins were obtained (Fig. 1B, left panel): vector (v), 23 kDa; FPN1-N, 25 kDa; FPN1-M, 31 kDa; and FPN1-C, 26 kDa. Of note, when bait proteins were examined using the anti-Myc mAb, an extra band in the bait vector alone was evident (Fig. 1B, left panel). When the same bait vector and yeast strain were used in a previous report by others, a similar extra band was detected by the anti-Myc mAb (32Alver R.C. Zhang T. Josephrajan A. Fultz B.L. Hendrix C.J. Das-Bradoo S. Bielinsky A.K. The N terminus of Mcm10 is important for interaction with the 9–1-1 clamp and in resistance to DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 8389-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The band in each lane indicated by an arrowhead (Fig. 1B, middle and right panels) was the expected molecular size of the prey fusion proteins, that is: vector (v), 23 kDa; I-F and II-F, 59 kDa (Fig. 1B, middle panel); I-1, II-1, III-1, and IV-1, 28 kDa; I-2, II-2, and III-2, 32 kDa; IV-2, 30 kDa; and I-3, II-3, III-3, and IV-3, 28 kDa (Fig. 1B, right panel). The KH2 domain is longer than KH1 or KH3, and thus the 28-kDa band was not observed in I-2, II-2, III-2, or IV-2. When prey proteins were examined by anti-HA mAb, multiple bands on the blots were evident, even using the prey vector alone (Fig. 1B, middle and right panels). Considering this finding, two other sources of anti-HA mAbs (from Wako Chemicals (Osaka Japan) and Covance Laboratories (Madison, WI)) were utilized for detection, and again, a similar pattern of multiple bands was detected (data not shown). Of interest, when the same prey vector and yeast strain were used in previous reports by others, similar multiple bands were detected by the anti-HA mAb (32Alver R.C. Zhang T. Josephrajan A. Fultz B.L. Hendrix C.J. Das-Bradoo S. Bielinsky A.K.

In summary, the band in each lane indicated by an arrowhead (Fig. 1B) was the expected molecular size of the fusion proteins. Hence, we demonstrated that all bait and prey constructs worked appropriately in yeast cells generating recombinant proteins of the correct size. These were then used for the studies below in Fig. 1C. When the N-terminal cytoplasmic region (FPN1-N) or the intracellular loop (FPN1-M) was expressed in yeast cells, these regions of FPN1 did not interact with PCBP1/PCBP2 or with any of the KH domains of PCBP1, PCBP2, PCBP3, and PCBP4 on SD-Leu-Trp-His-Ade-selective plates (Fig. 1C). In contrast, when the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of FPN1 (FPN1-C) was used as bait, we detected an interaction between FPN1 and the full-length form (II-F) or the KH2 domain (II-2) of PCBP2 (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the only other observed interaction under these conditions was the P53-SV40-T positive control. In summary, these findings suggest that the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of FPN1 interacts with PCBP2 and specifically the KH2 domain of PCBP2. As shown in Fig. 1, the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of FPN1 as bait interacted with PCBP2 in yeast cells. Next, we investigated the interactions between DMT1 and the PCBP family (Fig. 2) and further confirmed the interaction between FPN1 and PCBP2 by means of exchanging the bait and prey inserts. We used the same region of the KH domains in prey (Fig. 1A) and bait (Fig. 2A) constructs. Using cDNA segments corresponding to the KH1, KH2, and KH3 domains of PCBP1, PCBP2, PCBP3, and PCBP4 or full-length forms of PCBP1, PCBP2, PCBP3, and PCBP4 as bait (Fig. 2A) and DMT1 or FPN1 as prey, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 2). In this case, the full-length forms of PCBP3 and PCBP4 cloned into bait vectors could be isolated in yeast cells. To confirm the expression of recombinant proteins and ensure that each of them was expressed at its expected molecular weight in yeast cells, whole yeast protein was extracted and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). The expected molecular size of the bait fusion proteins was obtained: vector (v), 23 kDa; I-F and II-F, 59 kDa; III-F, 57 kDa; and IV-F, 61 kDa (Fig. 2B, top panel); I-1, II-1, III-1, and IV-1, 28 kDa; I-2, II-2, and III-2, 32 kDa; IV-2, 30 kDa; and I-3, II-3, III-3, and IV-3, 28 kDa (Fig. 2B, middle panel). The KH2 domain is longer than KH1 or KH3, and thus the 28-kDa band is not observed in I-2, II-2, III-2, or IV-2. Hence, the band in each lane was the expected molecular size (Fig. 2B). The band in each lane indicated by an arrowhead (Fig. 2B, bottom panel) was the expected molecular size of the prey fusion proteins, that is: vector (v), 23 kDa; FPN1-C, 26 kDa; and DMT1-N, 40 kDa. When FPN1-C or DMT1-N was expressed in yeast cells and detected by anti-HA mAb, multiple bands were again detected as shown in Fig. 1B. However, the band in each lane indicated by an arrowhead was the expected molecular size (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Hence, we determined that all bait and prey constructs worked appropriately in yeast cells generating the correct size fusion proteins. These were then used for the further studies described below. Notably, using SD-Leu-Trp-His-Ade-selective plates (Fig. 2C), the interactions of the KH2 domain and the full-length form of PCBP2 with the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of DMT1 and the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of FPN1 were detected in yeast cells along with the positive control (i.e. P53-SV40-T). However, other members of the PCBP family, or any of the KH domains of PCBP1, PCBP2, (except PCBP2 KH2), PCBP3, and PCBP4, were not demonstrated to interact with DMT1 or FPN1 (Fig. 2C). Considering the results in yeast cells described above, we then examined the interactions of FPN1/DMT1 with all members of the PCBP family in mammalian cells (Fig. 2D). Expression of all four PCBPs was clearly detected in both the total protein extraction and the membrane fraction using immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). It should be noted that multiple PCBP2 bands on the immunoblot were observed throughout the present study. When the expression of PCBP2 was silenced using siRNA, the intensities of these multiple bands were reduced (as shown later in Figs. 6A and 7D). Previous investigations have reported that the multiple PCBP2 bands on the immunoblots may represent alternative PCBP2 gene splice forms (34Toyoda H. Franco D. Fujita K. Paul A.V. Wimmer E.

Despite low implant failure levels, early loading protocols and simplified procedures necessitate the application of implants which promote bone formation, bone bonding and biomechanical stability. Here, screw-shaped, commercially pure titanium implants were selectively laser ablated within the thread valley using an Nd:YAG laser to produce a microtopography with a superimposed nanotexture and a thickened surface oxide layer. State-of-the-art machined implants served as controls. After eight weeks’ implantation in rabbit tibiae, resonance frequency analysis (RFA) values increased from insertion to retrieval for both implant types, while removal torque (RTQ) measurements showed 153% higher biomechanical anchorage of the laser-modified implants. Comparably high bone area (BA) and bone-implant contact (BIC) were recorded for both implant types but with distinctly different failure patterns following biomechanical testing. Fracture lines appeared within the bone ~30–50 μm from the laser-modified surface, while separation occurred at the bone-implant interface for the machined surface. Strong correlations were found between RTQ and BIC and between RFA at retrieval and BA. In the endosteal threads, where all the bone had formed de novo, the extracellular matrix composition, the mineralised bone area and osteocyte densities were comparable for the two types of implant. Using resin cast etching, osteocyte canaliculi were observed directly approaching the laser-modified implant surface. Transmission electron microscopy showed canaliculi in close proximity to the laser-modified surface, in addition to a highly ordered arrangement of collagen fibrils aligned parallel to the implant surface contour. It is concluded that the physico-chemical surface properties of laser-modified surfaces (thicker oxide, micro- and nanoscale texture) promote bone bonding which may be of benefit in situations where large demands are imposed on biomechanically stable interfaces, such as in early loading and in compromised conditions."

In China, approximately 20 percent of its population is rural-to-urban migrant workers and there are significant cultural differences between rural and urban societies, but no data are available regarding the acculturative stress of Chinese migrant workers. This study aimed to explore the forms and contexts of acculturative stress among Chinese migrant workers.Qualitative data were collected from four focus group discussions with 17 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant workers and three individual interviews with three medical professionals who provided mental health services for factory-workers in Shenzhen, China.The data in the current study showed that rural-to-urban migrant workers in China had experienced various forms of acculturative stress including difficulties in adapting to the environment, work-related stress, family-related stress, financial hardship, and lack of sense of belonging to cities.Rural-to-urban migration in China is a challenging transition with significant acculturative stress and demands for major adjustments among migrant workers. The assessment and management of acculturative stress is a necessary first step in providing mental health services to migrant workers."
https://openalex.org/W2440892874,"Agricultural operations generate large quantities of manure which must be eliminated in a manner that is consistent with public health guidelines. Meanwhile, construction and demolition waste makes up about 25% of total solid municipal waste. Co-composting of manure with construction and demolition waste offers a potential means to make manure safe for soil amendment and also divert construction and demolition waste from municipal landfills. Therefore, the archaeal, bacterial, and fungal microbiota of two different types of composted cattle manure and one co-composted with construction and demolition waste, were assessed over a 99-day composting period. The microbiota of the three compost mixtures did not differ, but significant changes over time and by sampling depth were observed. Bacillus and Halocella, however, were more relatively abundant in composted manure from cattle fed dried distillers' grains and solubles. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were enriched at day 0 and Firmicutes at day 99. The fungal genus Kernia was the most relatively abundant overall and was enriched at day 0. The concentration of 12 antimicrobial resistance determinants in the compost mixtures was also determined, and 10 of these determinants decreased significantly from days 0 to 99. The addition of construction and demolition waste did not affect the persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes or community structure of the compost microbiota and therefore co-composting construction and demolition waste with cattle manure offers a safe, viable way to divert this waste from landfills."

Membrane proteins are embedded in a lipid bilayer that covers a large percentage of their exposed surface. Lipid bilayers in typical human cells consist of hundreds of different lipid types that modulate cell signaling and protein function (1Janmey P.A. Kinnunen P.K. Biophysical properties of lipids and dynamic membranes.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 538-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Membrane lipid composition changes in several disease states and varies markedly over different cellular compartments. This influences the activity of transmembrane proteins by direct interactions with specific lipids or through changes in the biophysical properties of the membrane (e.g. fluidity, permeability, curvature, and lateral pressure) (2van Meer G.

The solute carriers (SLCs) consist of over 400 family members in humans. A quarter of these are associated with disease, making them excellent targets for clinical research (12César-Razquin A.

Elucidation of the lipid requirement for activity of mammalian solute carriers remains of paramount interest for drug discovery and general understanding of transport mechanisms. Members of the SLC2A family of facilitative hexose transporters are essential in regulating cellular metabolism by selectively transporting glucose down a concentration gradient without the use of energy. To date, 14 distinct human SLC2A isoforms (GLUTs) have been identified (13Thorens B. Mueckler M. Glucose transporters in the 21st century.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E141-E145Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and for several of these proteins the cellular function in health and disease has been established. Regulation of the insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 (SLC2A4), which is primarily responsible for mediating peripheral glucose disposal in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscle as well as adipose tissue (14James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Insulin-regulatable tissues express a unique insulin-sensitive glucose transport protein.Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), has been intensively studied in relation to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (15Bogan J.S. Regulation of glucose transporter translocation in health and diabetes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 507-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, the majority of GLUT4 remains sequestered within the cytosol in specialized membrane vesicles. Upon stimulation by insulin, a complex signaling cascade is initiated that results in the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface (16Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Insulin signalling and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar). In contrast, GLUT3 (SLC2A3), which has been classically defined as the neuronal glucose transporter due to the high level of expression and initial characterization in nervous tissue (17Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Glucose transporter proteins in brain: delivery of glucose to neurons and glia.Glia. 1997; 21: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), is constitutively present on the cell plasma membrane. GLUT3 is also highly expressed in other tissues with high energy needs, including sperm, embryonic tissue, and leukocytes (18Simpson I.A. Dwyer D. Malide D. Moley K.H. Travis A. Vannucci S.J. The facilitative glucose transporter GLUT3: 20 years of distinction.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295: E242-E253Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Despite the longstanding recognition of an association between changes in membrane lipid composition and glucose transport in human disease (19Weijers R.N. Lipid composition of cell membranes and its relevance in type 2 diabetes mellitus.Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2012; 8: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Field C.J. Ryan E.A. Thomson A.B.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11143-11150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the role of specific phospholipids on the functional activity of individual GLUT isoforms remains elusive. Although initial studies on the influence of lipids on the activity of GLUT1 isolated from erythrocyte membranes were performed nearly 30 years ago (21Tefft Jr., R.E. Carruthers A. Melchior D.L. Reconstituted human erythrocyte sugar transporter activity is determined by bilayer lipid head groups.Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3709-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), until recently it was not possible to isolate and reconstitute other GLUT isoforms in a functional form to allow comprehensive evaluation of membrane lipids, alone or in combination, at physiologically relevant levels. Here, for the first time we demonstrate that the glucose transport activity of GLUT4 and GLUT3 is controlled by the membrane phospholipid composition. Based on biochemical data and on crystal structures of GLUT3 and the close homologues GLUT1 and GLUT5 in multiple conformations, the currently accepted mechanism of action for these transporters is defined by interconversions between inward- and outward-facing conformations via a rocker-switch motion, governing the transport of solutes over the membrane barrier (22Nomura N. Verdon G. Kang H.J. Shimamura T. Nomura Y. Sonoda Y. Hussien S.A. Qureshi A.A. Coincon M. Sato Y. Abe H. Nakada-Nakura Y. Hino T. Arakawa T.

Hirata K. Yamamoto M. Fan S. Yan N. Molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport by glucose transporters.Nature. 2015; 526: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our findings expand the current model by introducing the modulation of transporter activity by specific phospholipids, thereby highlighting the importance of two classes of phospholipids that might regulate the activity of other members of the SLC family. To study the effect of different phospholipids at specific concentrations on the activity of GLUT4 and GLUT3, we developed an assay system allowing us to measure uptake of radiolabeled glucose into liposomes that contained purified transporter embedded in a tightly controlled lipid environment. Both transporters showed saturable uptake over seconds to minutes of their primary substrate d-glucose over the non-transportable l-glucose in liposomes containing 70% egg phosphatidylcholine (egg PC), 15% phosphatidic acid (PA), and 15% PE (mol/mol) (Fig. 1). Uptake was normalized to the amount of transporter in each uptake assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport could be completely abolished using the GLUT-specific inhibitor cytochalasin B (Fig. 1a). As expected for random insertion, the transporter incorporated into liposomes with roughly half in an outward-facing and half in an inward-facing orientation. Evidence for this conclusion was obtained from Western blotting analysis of the transporter using anti-FLAG antibody before and after tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage of an engineered N-terminal FLAG tag (Fig. 2). In detergent micelles, the protease has access to both faces of the transporter, although in liposomes, it can only access transporters that orient with their N terminus facing outward. We determined cleavage of the FLAG tag is ∼100% in micelles, whereas only ∼50% of all transporters in liposomes are cleaved by TEV protease. Interestingly, the immunoblot revealed that a fraction of GLUT4 in both detergent and liposomes ran as a dimer when tagged with FLAG but as a monomer when cleaved. All subsequent liposome experiments were carried out using tag-cleaved GLUT4 or GLUT3.FIGURE 2.GLUT4 is randomly inserted into liposomes. Western blotting analysis of FLAG-GLUT4 using anti-FLAG antibody before and after TEV protease cleavage of an engineered N-terminal FLAG tag. GLUT4 cleavage was carried out in LMNG detergent micelles or in 70% egg PC, 15% POPA, 15% POPE liposomes for 0, 3, and 24 h. FLAG-GLUT4 (sum of both monomer and dimer) was quantified using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We hypothesized that similar to several ion channels and receptor proteins, mammalian transporter function is regulated by its lipid environment. Several studies have shown that specific binding of annular lipids to various membrane proteins stabilize their structure and modulate their function (25Pliotas C. Dahl A.C. Rasmussen T.

For example, Laganowsky et al. (26Laganowsky A. Reading E. Allison T.M. Ulmschneider M.B. Degiacomi M.T. Baldwin A.J. Robinson C.V. Membrane proteins bind lipids selectively to modulate their structure and function.Nature. 2014; 510: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) demonstrated the stabilizing effect of lipids directly binding to several membrane proteins by preventing gas-phase unfolding in ion-mobility mass spectrometry experiments at increasing voltages. Similar to this approach, we devised a simple method to efficiently identify lipids that stabilize the transporter. Microgram amounts of lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) detergent-purified monomeric GLUT4 were incubated in the presence or absence of various lipids followed by thermal destabilization. The ability of specific lipids to stabilize the folded protein was assessed via size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We previously established that a single symmetrical peak in the SEC elution profile corresponds to monomeric, properly folded, active GLUT4, whereas multiple asymmetric peaks that elute earlier are an indicator of a heterogeneous population of destabilized, unfolded, or aggregated protein (28Kraft T.E. Hresko R.C. Hruz P.W. Expression, purification, and functional characterization of the insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4.Protein Sci. 2015; 24: 2008-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Monomeric GLUT4 eluted at 21.5 min (Fig. 3), near the predicted elution time of monomeric GLUT4 LMNG micelles (∼175 kDa = LMNG micelle (120 kDa) + GLUT4 (55 kDa)). The molecular mass standards of β-amylase (200 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) eluted at 20.6 and 24.7 min, respectively. In the presence of anionic phospholipids, a monomeric peak of folded GLUT4, comparable with unheated folded GLUT4 in LMNG micelles, was retained on the SEC profile (Fig. 3a), whereas zwitterionic and non-bilayer phospholipids did not stabilize the transporter, similar to heated GLUT4 in LMNG micelles (Fig. 3b). The observation that only anionic phospholipids stabilize the transporter structure prompts the question as to whether these lipids also modulate the function of GLUT4. We assessed the activity of the transporter in liposomes containing 100% egg PC or egg PC liposomes containing a second lipid at an 85:15, molar ratio. All glucose uptake data described in this study are presented as specific d-glucose uptake, calculated by subtracting nonspecific l-[3H]glucose from d-[3H]glucose uptake, to take into account the possibility of membrane leakage. No specific GLUT4-mediated uptake was observed in the zwitterionic phospholipids PC, PE, or sphingomyelin (SM) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the addition of the anionic phospholipids, PA or phosphatidylserine (PS), activated the transporter and resulted in specific d-glucose uptake (Fig. 4b). These results indicate a requirement for anionic phospholipids for transport activity and confirm our SEC results. To study the effect of the major naturally occurring anionic phospholipids in eukaryotic membranes in detail, we titrated palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA), palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylserine, palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) into PC liposomes and measured GLUT4-mediated uptake of d-glucose (Fig. 4c). All four anionic phospholipids led to a dose-dependent activation of GLUT4 with PA exhibiting the strongest effect, PS the second, followed by PI and phosphatidylglycerol. Anionic phospholipids also activated GLUT3 but with important differences (Fig. 4d). Unlike GLUT4, GLUT3 possessed measurable, albeit low, transport activity in the absence of anionic phospholipids. The addition of anionic phospholipids greatly enhanced GLUT3 activity, with PS having the most potent effect, followed by PA, and then phosphatidylglycerol and PI. The SEC and transport results suggest that anionic phospholipids interact directly with the transporter to stabilize its structure and are required for optimal GLUT4 and GLUT3 activity. Nonbilayer lipids like palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) have been shown to increase the activity of several membrane proteins in the presence of anionic phospholipids (6Kim K.-H.

To assess the effects of POPE on GLUT4 activity, we measured glucose transport in liposomes containing 10% POPA in egg PC, titrated with increasing amounts of POPE. POPE significantly increased glucose uptake reaching a maximum effect of 3-fold at 30% POPE (Fig. 5a). We next determined the effect of anionic phospholipids on GLUT4 activity in the presence of POPE. Glucose transport measured in liposomes containing 30% POPE in egg PC were titrated with POPA. As expected, POPA stimulated glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, and no specific uptake was observed in 30% POPE in the absence of anionic phospholipid (Fig. 5b). Unlike the other predominant mammalian zwitterionic lipids PC or SM, POPE is conically shaped with a small headgroup and one unsaturated acyl chain that occupies a larger volume than saturated chains. To determine whether the activating effect of POPE on GLUT4 is mediated by a specific interaction of the lipid to the transporter, as suggested for anionic phospholipids, or by altering the biophysical properties of the lipid bilayer, we compared the effect of the non-bilayer lipid palmitoyloleoyl glycerol (DAG) to POPE. Both lipids share the same aliphatic tails but significantly differ in their headgroup with DAG completely lacking the phosphate group and therefore exhibiting an even stronger conical shape than POPE (Fig. 5c). In the presence of DAG, GLUT4 activity was increased in a dose-dependent manner, similar to POPE (Fig. 5d). DAG showed a more pronounced effect on transporter activity with a maximal activation of >2-fold higher than POPE, correlating with its stronger conical shape. As the amount of DAG in the plasma membrane (PM) is a small fraction of PE (32Ingólfsson H.I. Melo M.N. van Eerden F.J. Arnarez C. Lopez C.A. Wassenaar T.A. Periole X. de Vries A.H. Tieleman D.P. Marrink S.J. Lipid organization of the plasma membrane.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 14554-14559Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that this lipid has a physiological role in activating GLUT4. Nevertheless, this experiment demonstrates that POPE and DAG activate GLUT4 not through a headgroup specific effect but through their conical shape via changes in the biophysical properties of the lipid bilayer (1Janmey P.A. Kinnunen P.K. Biophysical properties of lipids and dynamic membranes.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 538-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 3Bigay J. Antonny B.

Nonbilayer lipids affect peripheral and integral membrane proteins via changes in the lateral pressure profile.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This effect was also observed for GLUT3 (Fig. 5e). The addition of 15% conical lipids (POPE) increased transporter activity by 2.7-fold in the presence of anionic phospholipids. Similar to GLUT4, conical lipids did not significantly increase transporter activity of GLUT3 in the absence of anionic phospholipids. These results establish that conical lipids are necessary but not sufficient for optimal GLUT4 and GLUT3 transport activity. Like DAG, the levels of PA in mammalian PMs are quite low (∼1%), and therefore the more abundant anionic phospholipids PS and PI most likely contribute more significantly in terms of enhancing normal glucose transport activity. To determine whether the anionic and conical lipid effects are also observed in a more physiological environment, GLUT4 activity was measured in liposomes with a phospholipid composition comparable with that of a mammalian PM (Fig. 6a) (32Ingólfsson H.I. Melo M.N. van Eerden F.J. Arnarez C. Lopez C.A. Wassenaar T.A. Periole X. de Vries A.H. Tieleman D.P. Marrink S.J. Lipid organization of the plasma membrane.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 14554-14559Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Cell plasma membranes show trans-bilayer lipid asymmetry with anionic phospholipids being found exclusively and conical lipids preferentially on the cytoplasmic face (inner leaflet), a feature that distinguishes eukaryotic from prokaryotic membranes (1Janmey P.A. Kinnunen P.K. Biophysical properties of lipids and dynamic membranes.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 538-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Because of the technical challenge of generating asymmetric vesicles that recapitulate native mammalian cell membranes, characterization of the major phospholipids was carried out in liposomes composed of lipid levels found in either the PM inner leaflet (Fig. 6b) or the total PM membrane (Fig. 6c). To assess the contribution of each individual phospholipid on glucose transport, we determined transporter activity in liposomes after subsequent additions of lipids to the previous mix, starting with egg PC. From left to right, each bar represents an experiment in which an additional lipid was added to the previous lipid mix thereby reducing the molar amount of egg PC. The precise lipid compositions for each experiment can be found in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. As expected, in the presence of only the zwitterionic cylindrical lipid egg PC, no specific uptake was detected, although the addition of the anionic phospholipid PS significantly increased d-glucose uptake above background. Uptake was dramatically enhanced upon further addition of the conical lipid PE. Adding the other zwitterionic lipid SM to the system had no effect on glucose uptake, although the addition of physiological levels of PI to the lipid mixture containing PC, PS, PE, and SM further increased uptake. PA addition had no measurable effect on transport suggesting that the low level addition of PA was below the detection level for this assay. As anticipated, liposomes resembling the inner leaflet lead to higher GLUT4 activity due to the higher concentrations of anionic and conical lipids compared with liposomes composed of lipid compositions that approximate total PM. We used kinetic analysis to determine the mechanism of lipid-induced changes of glucose transporter function. The rate of zero-trans uptake of radiolabeled d-glucose into transporter-containing liposomes corrected for nonspecific uptake and normalized for the amount of transporter per assay was determined at increasing substrate concentrations with different amounts of POPA added to PC liposomes (Fig. 7, a and b) or different amounts of POPE added to PC liposomes that also contain 10% POPA (Fig. 7, c and d). From these data, we calculated the Michaelis constant Km and the turnover number kcat using non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism 6.0). For both GLUT3 and GLUT4, increasing concentrations of anionic or conical lipid increased the turnover number linearly but had no measurable effect on the Michaelis constant (Fig. 8). These data support a mechanism in which anionic and conical lipids increase the transporter interconversion rate and/or the fraction of active transporters without changing substrate binding affinity. Therefore, at saturating substrate concentration, anionic and conical lipids alter the rate-determining step in facilitative glucose transport. Similar to previous studies (34Augustin R. The protein family of glucose transport facilitators: It's not only about glucose after all.IUBMB Life. 2010; 62: 315-333PubMed Google Scholar), the reconstituted transporter GLUT3 showed higher affinity for d-glucose than GLUT4, although it transported its substrate with a lower turnover number than GLUT4.

Our previous studies have shown that BACE1 is degraded via the lysosomal pathway and that that depletion of the trafficking molecule Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing ARF-binding protein 3 (GGA3) results in increased BACE1 levels and activity because of impaired lysosomal degradation. We also determined that GGA3 regulation of BACE1 levels requires its ability to bind ubiquitin. Accordingly, we reported that BACE1 is ubiquitinated at lysine 501 and that lack of ubiquitination at lysine 501 produces BACE1 stabilization. Ubiquitin conjugation is a reversible process mediated by deubiquitinating enzymes. The ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8), an endosome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, regulates the ubiquitination, trafficking, and lysosomal degradation of several plasma membrane proteins. Here, we report that RNAi-mediated depletion of USP8 reduced levels of both ectopically expressed and endogenous BACE1 in H4 human neuroglioma cells. Moreover, USP8 depletion increased BACE1 ubiquitination, promoted BACE1 accumulation in the early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes, and decreased levels of BACE1 in the recycling endosomes. We also found that decreased BACE1 protein levels were accompanied by a decrease in BACE1-mediated amyloid precursor protein cleavage and amyloid-β levels. Our findings demonstrate that USP8 plays a key role in the trafficking and degradation of BACE1 by deubiquitinating lysine 501.

https://openalex.org/W2422850516,"Introduction Syndecan-1 (Sdc1; CD138) is a major transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on the extracellular, luminal surface of epithelial cells and syncytiotrophoblast, thus comprising a major component of the glycocalyx of these cells. The “soluble” (shed) form of Sdc1 has paracrine and autocrine functions and is normally produced in a regulated fashion. We compared plasma soluble Sdc1 concentrations, in relation to placental Sdc1 expression, in uncomplicated (control) and preeclamptic pregnancies. Methods We evaluated soluble Sdc1 across uncomplicated pregnancy, and between preeclamptic, gestational hypertensive and control patients at mid-pregnancy (20 weeks) and 3rd trimester by ELISA. Placental expression level of Sdc1 was compared between groups in relation to pre-delivery plasma soluble Sdc1. Participants were recruited from Magee-Womens Hospital. Results In uncomplicated pregnancy, plasma soluble Sdc1 rose significantly in the 1st trimester, and reached an approximate 50-fold increase at term compared to post pregnancy levels. Soluble Sdc1 was lower at mid-pregnancy in women who later developed preeclampsia (P<0.05), but not gestational hypertension, compared to controls, and remained lower at late pregnancy in preeclampsia (P<0.01) compared to controls. Sdc1 was prominently expressed on syncytiotrophoblast of microvilli. Syncytiotrophoblast Sdc1 immunostaining intensities, and mRNA content in villous homogenates, were lower in preeclampsia vs. controls (P<0.05). Soluble Sdc1 and Sdc1 immunostaining scores were inversely associated with systolic blood pressures, and positively correlated with infant birth weight percentile. Conclusion Soluble Sdc1 is significantly lower before the clinical onset of preeclampsia, with reduced expression of Sdc1 in the delivered placenta, suggesting a role for glycocalyx disturbance in preeclampsia pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2429558408,"Endocytic sorting and lysosomal degradation are integral to the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) function. Upon ligand binding, classical GPCRs are activated, internalized and recycled or sorted to lysosomes for degradation, a process that requires receptor ubiquitination. However, recent studies have demonstrated that numerous GPCRs are sorted to lysosomes independent of receptor ubiquitination. Here, we describe an ubiquitin-independent lysosomal sorting pathway for the purinergic GPCR P2Y1. After activation, P2Y1 sorts to lysosomes for degradation independent of direct ubiquitination that is mediated by a YPX3L motif within the second intracellular loop that serves as a binding site for the adaptor protein ALIX. Depletion of ALIX or site-directed mutation of the YPX3L motif inhibits P2Y1 sorting into the lumen of multivesicular endosomes/lysosomes and degradation. These findings confirm the function of YPX3L motifs as lysosomal targeting sequences for GPCRs and demonstrate that ALIX mediates the ubiquitin-independent degradation of certain GPCRs."

The survey explored the reasons, mechanisms, and emotions of such experiences. Memorable experiences linked with sad music typically occurred in relation to extremely familiar music, caused intense and pleasurable experiences, which were accompanied by physiological reactions and positive mood changes in about a third of the participants. A consistent structure of reasons and emotions for these experiences was identified through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses across the samples. Three types of sadness experiences were established, one that was genuinely negative (Grief-Stricken Sorrow) and two that were positive (Comforting Sorrow and Sweet Sorrow). Each type of emotion exhibited certain individual differences and had distinct profiles in terms of the underlying reasons, mechanisms, and elicited reactions. The prevalence of these broad types of emotional experiences suggested that positive experiences are the most frequent, but negative experiences were not uncommon in any of the samples. The findings have implications for measuring emotions induced by music and fiction in general, and call attention to the non-pleasurable aspects of these experiences."

A recurrent selection program was conducted to improve the drought tolerance and yield of bread wheat using drought tolerant advanced breeding lines from a drought tolerant x susceptible cross (HI 1500 x HUW 510). The parental lines were evaluated for yield, biomass and harvest index (HI) in addition to the drought adaptive traits like Canopy Temperature (CT), chlorophyll content and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI). After three rounds of recurrent selection, the half sib progenies exhibited a marked reduction in CT, chlorophyll content and biomass; whereas improvement was noted for yield, HI and NDVI. Drought tolerance of the half-sib population appeared enhanced as indicated by drought indices and grain yield. Compared to base population, half-sibs showed better HI, grain filling and a significant (17.1%) increase in grain yield under water stress conditions. Cooler canopies and increased early vigour might have contributed to drought tolerance. A favourable combination of gibberellin sensitive and insensitive Rhtalleles was observed in the recombinant progenies. However, increased yield under water stress had a negative trade off in reduction of biomass. The study also identified potential lines with high yield and drought tolerance for subsequent varietal development for water limited areas."
https://openalex.org/W2430370065,"Cattle temperament is an important factor that affects the profitability of beef cattle enterprises, due to its relationship with productivity traits, animal welfare and labor safety. Temperament is a complex phenotype often assessed by measuring a series of behavioral traits, which result from the effects of multiple environmental and genetic factors, and their interactions. The aims of this study were to perform a genome-wide association study and detect genomic regions, potential candidate genes and their biological mechanisms underlying temperament, measured by flight speed (FS) test in Nellore cattle.The genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using a single-step procedure (ssGBLUP) which combined simultaneously all 16,600 phenotypes from genotyped and non-genotyped animals, full pedigree information of 162,645 animals and 1,384 genotyped animals in one step. The animals were genotyped with High Density Bovine SNP BeadChip which contains 777,962 SNP markers. After quality control (QC) a total of 455,374 SNPs remained.Heritability estimated for FS was 0.21 ± 0.02. Consecutive SNPs explaining 1% or more of the total additive genetic variance were considered as windows associated with FS. Nine candidate regions located on eight different Bos taurus chromosomes (BTA) (1 at 73 Mb, 2 at 65 Mb, 5 at 22 Mb and 119 Mb, 9 at 98 Mb, 11 at 67 Mb, 15 at 16 Mb, 17 at 63 Kb, and 26 at 47 Mb) were identified. The candidate genes identified in these regions were NCKAP5 (BTA2), PARK2 (BTA9), ANTXR1 (BTA11), GUCY1A2 (BTA15), CPE (BTA17) and DOCK1 (BTA26). Among these genes PARK2, GUCY1A2, CPE and DOCK1 are related to dopaminergic system, memory formation, biosynthesis of peptide hormone and neurotransmitter and brain development, respectively.Our findings allowed us to identify nine genomic regions (SNP windows) associated with beef cattle temperament, measured by FS test. Within these windows, six promising candidate genes and their biological functions were identified. These results may contribute to a better comprehension into the genetic control of temperament expression in Nellore cattle."

Here, we introduce a simple tunable measure for analysing the similarity of nodes across different link weights. In particular, we use the measure to analyze homophily in a group of 659 freshman students at a large university. Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom data collection software, complemented by questionnaire-based data. The network of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face contacts. We find that even strongly connected individuals are not more similar with respect to basic personality traits than randomly chosen pairs of individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels of acquaintanceships."
https://openalex.org/W2433741332,"Even though the total SA American population is increasing rapidly, there is a paucity of information on the relationship between diet quality, acculturation and health outcomes such as Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in the low-income South Asian (SA) sub-population. Our goal was to examine diet quality, degree of acculturation and their potential influence on MetS in a diverse sample of SA Americans. A convenience sample of 401 adult SA men and women were studied using a cross-sectional study design. Volunteers from two low-income community health clinics in Maryland were interviewed by questionnaires. MetS, defined by the consensus harmonized definition by the presence of ≥ 3 of the 5 abnormal indicators, was studied. An interviewer obtained an automated self-administered 24-hour Recall (ASA24) and an acculturation index (using a previously validated (SL-ASIA). SA had a composite HEI2010 score of 68 suggesting an overall need for diet improvements. Males had a higher diet quality (mean HEI2010 score) than females. Males with MetS had lower diet quality (68) than males without MetS (73). The converse was true for females (68 vs. 65). Americanized (more acculturated) subjects had a higher diet quality compared to less acculturated SA. Small differences were found in diet quality scores among SA adults from different countries. Less acculturated females, had a higher percentage of MetS and lower diet quality compared to males. These results suggest that interventions are needed in males and females who were less acculturated because they may have greater MetS and lower diet quality compared to more Americanized SA."

Methods In a cross-sectional substudy within the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study, participants were examined for number of decayed teeth (DT), Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT), oral mucosal disease, and periodontal disease (PD). Covariates for oral health parameters were examined using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and ordinal logistic regression models. Results Eleven sites enrolled 209 PHIV and 126 PHEU. Higher DT scores were observed in participants who were PHIV [Adjusted Mean Ratio (aMR) = 1.7 (95% CI 1.2–2.5)], female [aMR = 1.4 (1.0–1.9)], had no source of regular dental care [aMR = 2.3 (1.5–3.4)], and had a high frequency of meals/snacks [≥5 /day vs 0–3, aMR = 1.9 (1.1–3.1)] and juice/soda [≥5 /day vs 0–3, aMR = 1.6 (1.1–2.4)]. Higher DMFT scores were observed in participants who were older [≥19, aMR = 1.9 (1.2–2.9)], had biological parent as caregiver [aMR = 1.2 (1.0–1.3)], had a high frequency of juice/soda [≥5 /day vs 0–3, aMR = 1.4 (1.1–1.7)] and a low saliva flow rate [mL/min, aMR = 0.8 per unit higher (0.6–1.0)]. Eighty percent had PD; no differences were seen by HIV status using the patient-based classifications of health, gingivitis or mild, moderate, or severe periodontitis. No associations were observed of CD4 count and viral load with oral health outcomes after adjustment. Conclusions Oral health was poor in PHIV and PHEU youth. This was dismaying since most HIV infected children in the U.S. are carefully followed at medical health care clinics. This data underscore the need for regular dental care. As PHIV youth were at higher risk for cavities, it will be important to better understand this relationship in order to develop targeted interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2421608912,"Obesity is a major risk factor predisposing to the development of peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Elevated food intake and/or decreased energy expenditure promotes body weight gain and acquisition of adipose tissue. Number of studies implicated phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes and their product, phosphatidic acid (PA), in regulation of signaling cascades controlling energy intake, energy dissipation and metabolic homeostasis. However, the impact of PLD enzymes on regulation of metabolism has not been directly determined so far. In this study we utilized mice deficient for two major PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, to assess the impact of these enzymes on regulation of metabolic homeostasis. We showed that mice lacking PLD1 or PLD2 consume more food than corresponding control animals. Moreover, mice deficient for PLD2, but not PLD1, present reduced energy expenditure. In addition, deletion of either of the PLD enzymes resulted in development of elevated body weight and increased adipose tissue content in aged animals. Consistent with the fact that elevated content of adipose tissue predisposes to the development of hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, characteristic for the pre-diabetic state, we observed that Pld1-/- and Pld2-/- mice present elevated free fatty acids (FFA) levels and are insulin as well as glucose intolerant. In conclusion, our data suggest that deficiency of PLD1 or PLD2 activity promotes development of overweight and diabetes."

This study aims to estimate the prevalence and to identify risk factors associated with HPV infection among women from Grand Tunis, Tunisia. We conducted a cross-sectional study, between December 2012 and May 2013. Eligible women for this study were those aged 18-65 years, sexually active, who sought medical attention at their primary health care centre or clinic in Grand Tunis, Tunisia and who gave written consent. A liquid-based Pap smear sample was obtained from all women using a cervical brush. Only women with betaglobin positive test were further analysed for HPV detection and typing. A nested-PCR of the L1 region was performed followed by reverse line blot hybridization to facilitate the specific detection of 31 HPV genotypes. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used for the analysis of associations between variables with some considered possible confounders after checking for interactions. A total of 391 women were enrolled in this study and 325 out of the 391 cervical samples were positive for the betaglobin test. Overall HPV prevalence was 13.2% [9.8%-17.5%], with the following most prevalent HPV genotypes: HPV6 (40%), HPV40 (14%), HPV16 (12%), HPV52 (9%), HPV31 and HPV59 (7%), followed by HPV68 (4%). Mean age of HPV positive women was 40.7±0.92 years. Independently associated risk factors of HPV infection were smoking (OR:2.8 [0.8-9.6]), low income (OR:9.6 [1.4-63.4), bad housing type (OR:2.5 [1-6.8]), partner with multiple sexual relationship (OR:4.5 [0.9-22.9]) and single women (widowed, divorced, separated, never married) (OR:6.9 [1.1-42.2]). This study provides the first national-based estimate of HPV prevalence in Tunisia. Our findings contribute to the evidence on the current burden of HPV infection, the critical role of sexual behaviour and socioeconomic status and call for increased support for the screening program in Tunisia to prevent cervical cancer. These results allow us to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccine program implementation in Tunisia in future."
https://openalex.org/W2436693928,"JJX12 is an engineered bispecific antibody against ricin, a member of the medically important A-B family of toxins that exploits retrograde transport as means to gain entry into the cytosol of target cells. JJX12 consists of RTA-D10, a camelid single variable domain (VHH) antibody directed against an epitope on ricin's enzymatic subunit (RTA), linked via a 15-mer peptide to RTB-B7, a VHH against ricin's bivalent galactose binding subunit (RTB). We previously reported that JJX12, but not an equimolar mixture of RTA-D10 and RTB-B7 monomers, was able to passively protect mice against a lethal dose ricin challenge, demonstrating that physically linking RTB-B7 and RTA-D10 is critical for toxin-neutralizing activity in vivo. We also reported that JJX12 promotes aggregation of ricin in solution, presumably through the formation of intermolecular crosslinking. In the current study, we now present evidence that JJX12 affects the dynamics of ricin uptake and trafficking in human epithelial cells. Confocal microscopy, as well as live cell imaging coupled with endocytosis pathway-specific inhibitors, revealed that JJX12-toxin complexes are formed on the surfaces of mammalian cells and internalized via a pathway sensitive to amiloride, a known inhibitor of macropinocytosis. Moreover, in the presence of JJX12, retrograde transport of ricin to the trans-Golgi network was significantly reduced, while accumulation of the toxin in late endosomes was significantly enhanced. In summary, we propose that JJX12, by virtue of its ability to crosslink ricin toxin, alters the route of toxin uptake and trafficking within cells."
https://openalex.org/W2427929400,"Background We performed a retrospective study to assess the clinicopathological characters, molecular alterations and multigene mutation profiles in colorectal cancer patients with signet-ring cell component. Methods Between November 2008 and January 2015, 61 consecutive primary colorectal carcinomas with signet-ring cell component were available for pathological confirmation. RAS/BRAF status was performed by direct sequencing. 14 genes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes were analyzed by targeted gene sequencing. Results A slight male predominance was detected in these patients (59.0%). Colorectal carcinomas with signet-ring cell component were well distributed along the large intestine. A frequently higher TNM stage at the time of diagnosis was observed, compared with the conventional adenocarcinoma. Family history of malignant tumor was remarkable with 49.2% in 61 cases. The median OS time of stage IV patients in our study was 14 months. RAS mutations were detected in 22.2% (12/54) cases with KRAS mutations in 16.7% (9/54) cases and Nras mutations in 5.4%(3/54) cases. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 3.7% (2/54) cases. As an exploration, we analyzed 14 genes by targeted gene sequencing. These genes were selected based on their biological role in association with hereditary cancer syndromes. 79.6% cases carried at least one pathogenic mutation. Finally, the patients were classified by the percentage of signet-ring cell. 39 (63.9%) cases were composed of ≥50% signet-ring cells; 22 (36.1%) cases were composed of <50% signet-ring cells. We compared clinical parameters, molecular and genetic alterations between the two groups and found no significant differences. Conclusions Colorectal adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell component is characterized by advanced stage at diagnosis with remarkable family history of malignant tumor. It is likely a negative prognostic factor and tends to affect male patients with low rates of RAS /BRAF mutation. Colorectal patients with any component of signet-ring cells, regardless of the extent, shared similar clinicopathological characteristics, molecular alterations and genetic profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2433798821,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), a Ser/Thr kinase, and PARKIN, a ubiquitin ligase, are causal genes for autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that PINK1 and PARKIN cooperatively control the quality of the mitochondrial population via selective degradation of damaged mitochondria by autophagy. Here, we report that PINK1 and PARKIN induce cell death with a 12-h delay after mitochondrial depolarization, which differs from the time profile of selective autophagy of mitochondria. This type of cell death exhibited definite morphologic features such as plasma membrane rupture, was insensitive to a pan-caspase inhibitor, and did not involve mitochondrial permeability transition. Expression of a constitutively active form of PINK1 caused cell death in the presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, irrespective of the mitochondrial membrane potential. PINK1-mediated cell death depended on the activities of PARKIN and proteasomes, but it was not affected by disruption of the genes required for autophagy. Furthermore, fluorescence and electron microscopic analyses revealed that mitochondria were still retained in the dead cells, indicating that PINK1-mediated cell death is not caused by mitochondrial loss. Our findings suggest that PINK1 and PARKIN play critical roles in selective cell death in which damaged mitochondria are retained, independent of mitochondrial autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2433992484,"Late-replicating domains (intercalary heterochromatin) in the Drosophila genome display a number of features suggesting their organization is quite unique. Typically, they are quite large and encompass clusters of functionally unrelated tissue-specific genes. They correspond to the topologically associating domains and conserved microsynteny blocks. Our study aims at exploring further details of molecular organization of intercalary heterochromatin and has uncovered surprising heterogeneity of chromatin composition in these regions. Using the 4HMM model developed in our group earlier, intercalary heterochromatin regions were found to host chromatin fragments with a particular epigenetic profile. Aquamarine chromatin fragments (spanning 0.67% of late-replicating regions) are characterized as a class of sequences that appear heterogeneous in terms of their decompactization. These fragments are enriched with enhancer sequences and binding sites for insulator proteins. They likely mark the chromatin state that is related to the binding of cis-regulatory proteins. Malachite chromatin fragments (11% of late-replicating regions) appear to function as universal transitional regions between two contrasting chromatin states. Namely, they invariably delimit intercalary heterochromatin regions from the adjacent active chromatin of interbands. Malachite fragments also flank aquamarine fragments embedded in the repressed chromatin of late-replicating regions. Significant enrichment of insulator proteins CP190, SU(HW), and MOD2.2 was observed in malachite chromatin. Neither aquamarine nor malachite chromatin types appear to correlate with the positions of highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNE) that are typically replete in intercalary heterochromatin. Malachite chromatin found on the flanks of intercalary heterochromatin regions tends to replicate earlier than the malachite chromatin embedded in intercalary heterochromatin. In other words, there exists a gradient of replication progressing from the flanks of intercalary heterochromatin regions center-wise. The peculiar organization and features of replication in large late-replicating regions are discussed as possible factors shaping the evolutionary stability of intercalary heterochromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2438395401,"Objective Diabetes prevalence among ethnic minorities and immigrants often differs from the majority indigenous population. We compared diabetes prevalence, incidence and risk among Ethiopian and non-Ethiopian Jews. Within these main groups, we controlled for the effect of migration on diabetes risk by comparing the subgroups of Ethiopian and former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants, and compared both with Israeli-born non-Ethiopian Jews. Methods The study cohort included adult Ethiopian (n = 8,398) and age-matched non-Ethiopian Jews (n = 15,977) and subgroups: Ethiopian immigrants (n = 7,994), FSU immigrants (n = 1,541) and Israeli-born non-Ethiopian Jews (n = 10,828). Diabetes prevalence, annual incidence, and hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for sex and metabolic syndrome (MetS)-components, were determined in three age groups (<50yrs, 50-59yrs, and ≥60yrs). Comparisons of body mass index (BMI) at diabetes incidence were made. Results Younger (<50yrs) Ethiopians had higher prevalence rates, 3.6% (95%CI: 3.1–4.1) and annual incidence, 0.9% (95%CI: 0.8–1.0) than non-Ethiopians, 2.7% (95%CI: 2.3–3.0) and 0.5% (95%CI: 0.4–0.6), respectively. These differences were particularly pronounced among Ethiopian women. Diabetes risk among Ethiopians was higher and adjustment for MetS-components was important only for BMI, which further increased hazard ratio (HR) estimates associated with Ethiopian ethnicity from 1.81 (95% CI:1.50–2.17) to 2.31 (95% CI:1.91–2.79). The same differences were seen when comparing Ethiopian to FSU immigrants. BMI before incident diabetes was lower among younger Ethiopian immigrants than younger FSU immigrants and Israeli-born. Conclusions Ethiopian ethnicity is associated with increased diabetes risk, which is age and BMI dependent. Young Ethiopians<50yrs, particularly women, had the greatest increase in risk. Lower BMI cut-offs should be defined to reflect diabetes risk among Ethiopians."
https://openalex.org/W2429696257,"Pod shattering resistance index (SRI) is a key factor affecting the mechanical harvesting of rapeseed. Research on the differences in pod shattering resistance levels of various rapeseed varieties can provide a theoretical basis for varietal breeding and application in mechanical harvesting. The indicators on pod shattering resistance including pod morphology and wall components were evaluated on eight hybrids and open pollinators, respectively, during 2012–2014. The results showed the following: (1) From the current study, SRI varied greatly with variety, and conventional varieties had stronger resistance than hybrid according to the physiological indexes. and (2) Under the experimental conditions, the SRI was linearly related to pod wall weight and the water content in pod walls, and the goodness-of-fit measurements for the regression model of the SRI based on pod wall weight and water content were 0.584** and 0.377*, respectively, reaching the significant level. This illustrated that pod wall weight and the water content in pod walls determined the SRI. (3) Compared with the relative contents of biochemical components in pod walls, the contents of particular biochemical components in pod walls had closer correlations with SRI. Among the biochemical components, the hemicellulose content was the decisive factor for the SRI."
https://openalex.org/W2431493752,"Hedgehog (Hh) signalling is a potent regulator of cell fate and function. While much is known about the events within a Hh-stimulated cell, far less is known about the regulation of Hh-ligand production. Drosophila Hyperplastic Discs (Hyd), a ubiquitin-protein ligase, represents one of the few non-transcription factors that independently regulates both hh mRNA expression and pathway activity. Using a murine embryonic stem cell system, we revealed that shRNAi of the mammalian homologue of hyd, Ubr5, effectively prevented retinoic-acid-induced Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression. We next investigated the UBR5:Hh signalling relationship in vivo by generating and validating a mouse bearing a conditional Ubr5 loss-of-function allele. Conditionally deleting Ubr5 in the early embryonic limb-bud mesenchyme resulted in a transient decrease in Indian hedgehog ligand expression and decreased Hh pathway activity, around E13.5. Although Ubr5-deficient limbs and digits were, on average, shorter than control limbs, the effects were not statistically significant. Hence, while loss of UBR5 perturbed Hedgehog signalling in the developing limb, there were no obvious morphological defects. In summary, we report the first conditional Ubr5 mutant mouse and provide evidence for a role for UBR5 in influencing Hh signalling, but are uncertain to whether the effects on Hedgehog signaling were direct (cell autonomous) or indirect (non-cell-autonomous). Elaboration of the cellular/molecular mechanism(s) involved may help our understanding on diseases and developmental disorders associated with aberrant Hh signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2951775826,"Magnetotactic bacteria are aquatic organisms that produce subcellular magnetic particles in order to orient in the earth's geomagnetic field. MamE, a predicted HtrA protease required to produce magnetite crystals in the magnetotactic bacterium Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1, was recently shown to promote the proteolytic processing of itself and two other biomineralization factors in vivo. Here, we have analyzed the in vivo processing patterns of three proteolytic targets and used this information to reconstitute proteolysis with a purified form of MamE. MamE cleaves a custom peptide substrate with positive cooperativity, and its autoproteolysis can be stimulated with exogenous substrates or peptides that bind to either of its PDZ domains. A misregulated form of the protease that circumvents specific genetic requirements for proteolysis causes biomineralization defects, showing that proper regulation of its activity is required during magnetite biosynthesis in vivo. Our results represent the first reconstitution of the proteolytic activity of MamE and show that its behavior is consistent with the previously proposed checkpoint model for biomineralization.

Cells with a catalytically inactive (EPD) allele of mamE show an intermediate biomineralization phenotype in which they produce small magnetite particles. Wild-type AMB-1 has a distribution of crystal sizes centered at 50–60 nm in diameter, but the size distribution in the EPD cells is centered at ∼20 nm. Interestingly, ∼97% of the crystals in the EPD strain are smaller than 35 nm, the point above which magnetite particles become paramagnetic and can hold a stable magnetic dipole. The correlation between mineral sizes in the EPD strain and the superparamagnetic to paramagnetic transition point lead to a model predicting that cells produce small superparamagnetic crystals until an unknown signal activates MamE, promoting maturation to paramagnetic particles (13Quinlan A.

Although MamO was also required for these proteolytic events, this effect did not require its predicted protease active site. Subsequent structural analysis showed that the protease domain of MamO was locked in an inactive state and incapable of catalysis, suggesting that it played a non-catalytic role in activating MamE (24Hershey D.M. Ren X. Melnyk R.A. Browne P.J. Ozyamak E. Jones S.R. Chang M.C.Y. Hurley J.H. Komeili A.

Despite the genetic evidence for the role of MamE in proteolysis, its activity has not been confirmed directly using purified components. Studies aimed at understanding the catalytic activity of MamE and its regulation have been hindered by an inability to obtain recombinant protein. Here, we have characterized MamE-dependent proteolysis in detail and identified a number of regulatory mechanisms. Developing a method to purify MamE and analyzing in vivo proteolytic patterns of each target facilitated reconstitution of MamE-dependent proteolysis in vitro. Detailed analysis of its catalytic activity suggests a switch-like model in which the basal state of the protein is an inactive form that can be turned on through a number of routes. A constitutively active allele of MamE disrupts biomineralization, confirming that properly regulated proteolysis is critical to magnetosome formation.

Lysozyme was added from 50 mg/ml stock to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 15 ml of lysis buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2) was added along with DTT to 2 mm and DNase to 5 μg/ml, and the suspension was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with agitation. The cells were sonicated twice for 10 s, and the suspension was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min to isolate the magnetite-associated material. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 5.5 ml of solubilization buffer (20 mm BisTris 2The abbreviations used are:BisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolDDMn-dodecyl β-d-maltosideNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidTEVtobacco etch virusMBPmaltose-binding protein. -HCl, pH 7.0, 75 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol), and CHAPS was added to 1% (w/v) from a 10% (w/v) stock solution. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 15min with agitation followed by an incubation for 15 min at 4 °C with agitation. The suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 5.5 ml of solubilization buffer, and the detergent extraction was repeated with 1% (w/v) FosCholine. The FosCholine-soluble material was loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap Q FF column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with solubilization buffer containing 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM). The column was washed with 10 ml of solubilization buffer with 0.03% (w/v) DDM and eluted with 4 ml of buffer Q1 (20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 275 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) with 0.03% (w/v) DDM followed by 4 ml of buffer Q2 (20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 400 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) with 0.03% (w/v) DDM. The Q1 fraction was added to 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C with agitation for 3 h. The resin was isolated by centrifuging at 4,000 × g and washed with sequential 1-ml washes of buffer Q2, buffer Q1, and solubilization buffer, each containing 0.03% (w/v) DDM. Bound proteins were eluted by three washes with 50 μl of 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, which were then pooled with 50 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid tobacco etch virus maltose-binding protein. The concentrated FLAG elution fraction was separated on a 12% (w/v) acrylamide gel and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. A ∼3 × 10-mm section of the gel corresponding to the processed MamO band was excised from the gel and chopped into small pieces. These were washed with 100 mm NH4HCO3 followed by reduction and alkylation of cysteines with DTT and iodoacetamide. The gel pieces were then dehydrated by washing with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in 100 mm NH4HCO3 and dried under vacuum. A 0.1 mg/ml solution of trypsin was used to re-swell the gel pieces, and they were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel slices with successive washes of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid solutions containing increasing concentrations of acetonitrile. The extracts were pooled in a fresh tube, concentrated under vacuum to remove the organic phase, and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Trypsin-digested protein samples were analyzed using a Thermo Dionex UltiMate3000 RSLCnano liquid chromatograph that was connected in-line with an LTQ-Orbitrap-XL mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The LC was equipped with a C18 analytical column (Acclaim® PepMap RSLC, 150-mm length × 0.075-mm inner diameter, 2-μm particles, 100-Å pores; Thermo) and a 1-μl sample loop. Acetonitrile (Fisher Optima grade, 99.9% (v/v)), formic acid (1-ml ampules, 99+% (v/v), Thermo Pierce), and water purified to a resistivity of 18.2 megaohms·cm (at 25 °C) using a Milli-Q Gradient ultrapure water purification system (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used to prepare mobile phase solvents. Solvent A was 99.9% water, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and solvent B was 99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The elution program consisted of isocratic flow at 2% B for 4 min, a linear gradient to 30% B over 38 min, isocratic flow at 95% B for 6 min, and isocratic flow at 2% B for 12 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Full-scan mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode over the range m/z = 350–1,800 using the Orbitrap mass analyzer, in profile format, with a mass resolution setting of 60,000 (at m/z = 400, measured at full width at half-maximum peak height), which provided isotopic resolution for singly and multiply charged peptide ions. Thus, an ion's mass and charge could be determined independently (i.e. the charge state was determined from the reciprocal of the spacing between adjacent isotope peaks in the m/z spectrum). In the data-dependent mode, the eight most intense ions exceeding an intensity threshold of 50,000 counts were selected from each full-scan mass spectrum for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis using collision-induced dissociation. MS/MS spectra were acquired using the linear ion trap, in centroid format, with the following parameters: isolation width, 3 m/z units; normalized collision energy, 30%; default charge state, 3+; activation Q, 0.25; and activation time, 30 ms. Real-time charge state screening was enabled to exclude unassigned and 1+ charge states from MS/MS analysis. Real-time dynamic exclusion was enabled to preclude reselection of previously analyzed precursor ions, with the following parameters: repeat count 2, repeat duration 10 s, exclusion list size 500, exclusion duration 90 s, and exclusion mass width 20 ppm. Data acquisition was controlled using Xcalibur software (version 2.0.7, Thermo). Raw data were searched against the M. magneticum AMB-1 FASTA protein database using Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.3, SEQUEST algorithm, Thermo). Peptide identifications were validated by manual inspection of MS/MS spectra (i.e. to check for the presence of y-type and b-type fragment ions that identify the peptide sequences) (27Roepstroff P. Fohlman J. Proposal for a common nomenclature for sequence ions in mass spectra of peptides.Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601PubMed Google Scholar). In the expression construct used to purify MamE, the N-terminal membrane anchor is replaced with the OmpA signal peptide to produce a soluble protein that can still undergo heme loading in the periplasm (28Londer Y.Y. Pokkuluri P.R. Orshonsky V. Orshonsky L. Schiffer M. Heterologous expression of dodecaheme “nanowire” cytochromes c from Geobacter sulfurreducens.Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Initial fractionations with an N-terminally His6-tagged form of the protein had significant contamination due to what appeared to be truncated fragments caused by autocleavage during expression. To eliminate this problem, a Strep-tag was added on the C terminus to allow for a sequential affinity isolation of full-length protein. Finally, MamE has a predicted region of 60–70 disordered residues downstream of the N-terminal membrane anchor and upstream of the trypsin-like domain. Removing this region dramatically improved the solubility. The plasmids pAK825 or pAK964 were transferred to C43 cells (Lucigen) that had been previously transformed with the pEC86 heme-loading plasmid (29Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Künzler P.

https://openalex.org/W2422615882,"Dialysis therapy for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) continues to be the readily available renal replacement option in developing countries. While the impact of rural/remote dwelling on mortality among dialysis patients in developed countries is known, it remains to be defined in sub-Saharan Africa.A single-center database of end-stage renal disease patients on chronic dialysis therapies treated between 2007 and 2014 at the Polokwane Kidney and Dialysis Centre (PKDC) of the Pietersburg Provincial Hospital, Limpopo South Africa, was retrospectively reviewed. All-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-related mortalities were assessed and associated baseline predictors determined.Of the 340 patients reviewed, 52.1% were male, 92.9% were black Africans, 1.8% were positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 87.5% were rural dwellers. The average distance travelled to the dialysis centre was 112.3 ± 73.4 Km while 67.6% of patients lived in formal housing. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis initiation was 7.1 ± 3.7 mls/min while hemodialysis (HD) was the predominant modality offered (57.1%). Ninety-two (92) deaths were recorded over the duration of follow-up with the majority (34.8%) of deaths arising from infection-related causes. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.62, CI: 1.07-2.46) and infection-related mortality (HR: 2.27, CI: 1.13-4.60). On multivariable cox regression, CAPD remained a significant predictor of all-cause mortality (HR: 2.00, CI: 1.29-3.10) while the risk of death among CAPD patients was also significantly modified by diabetes mellitus (DM) status (HR: 4.99, CI: 2.13-11.71).CAPD among predominantly rural dwelling patients in the Limpopo province of South Africa is associated with an increased risk of death from all-causes and infection-related causes."
https://openalex.org/W2441896160,"One of the main strategies to control the spread of infectious animal diseases is the implementation of movement restrictions. This paper shows a loss in efficiency of the movement restriction policy (MRP) when behavioral responses of farmers are taken into account. Incorporating the strategic behavior of farmers in an epidemiologic model reveals that the MRP can trigger premature animal sales by farms at high risk of becoming infected that significantly reduce the efficacy of the policy. The results are validated in a parameterized network via Monte Carlo simulations and measures to mitigate the loss of efficiency of the MRP are discussed. Financial aid to farmers can be justified by public health concerns, not only for equity. This paper contributes to developing an interdisciplinary analytical framework regarding the expansion of infectious diseases combining economic and epidemiologic dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W2428402152,"The vertical segments of Populus stems are an ideal experimental system for analyzing the gene expression patterns involved in primary and secondary growth during wood formation. Suitable internal control genes are indispensable to quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays of gene expression. In this study, the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes was evaluated in a series of vertical stem segments of Populus tomentosa. Analysis through software packages geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper showed that genes ribosomal protein (RP) and tubulin beta (TUBB) were the most unstable across the developmental stages of P. tomentosa stems, and the combination of the three reference genes, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), Actin (ACT6) and elongation factor 1-beta (EF1-beta) can provide accurate and reliable normalization of qRT–PCR analysis for target gene expression in stem segments undergoing primary and secondary growth in P. tomentosa. These results provide crucial information for transcriptional analysis in the P. tomentosa stem, which may help to improve the quality of gene expression data in these vertical stem segments, which constitute an excellent plant system for the study of wood formation."
https://openalex.org/W2423241189,"In this paper, we propose an automatic method of synthesizing panoramic radiographs from dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data for directly observing the whole dentition without the superimposition of other structures. This method consists of three major steps. First, the dental arch curve is generated from the maximum intensity projection (MIP) of 3D CBCT data. Then, based on this curve, the long axial curves of the upper and lower teeth are extracted to create a 3D panoramic curved surface describing the whole dentition. Finally, the panoramic radiograph is synthesized by developing this 3D surface. Both open-bite shaped and closed-bite shaped dental CBCT datasets were applied in this study, and the resulting images were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method. With the proposed method, a single-slice panoramic radiograph can clearly and completely show the whole dentition without the blur and superimposition of other dental structures. Moreover, thickened panoramic radiographs can also be synthesized with increased slice thickness to show more features, such as the mandibular nerve canal. One feature of the proposed method is that it is automatically performed without human intervention. Another feature of the proposed method is that it requires thinner panoramic radiographs to show the whole dentition than those produced by other existing methods, which contributes to the clarity of the anatomical structures, including the enamel, dentine and pulp. In addition, this method can rapidly process common dental CBCT data. The speed and image quality of this method make it an attractive option for observing the whole dentition in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2429250841,"Background & Objective Placental abruption, an ischemic placental disorder, complicates about 1 in 100 pregnancies, and is an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Metabolomics holds promise for improving the phenotyping, prediction and understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of complex clinical disorders including abruption. We sought to evaluate maternal early pregnancy pre-diagnostic serum metabolic profiles and abnormal vaginal bleeding as predictors of abruption later in pregnancy. Methods Maternal serum was collected in early pregnancy (mean 16 weeks, range 15 to 22 weeks) from 51 abruption cases and 51 controls. Quantitative targeted metabolic profiles of serum were acquired using electrospray ionization liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS/MS) and the Absolute IDQ® p180 kit. Maternal sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive history were abstracted from medical records. Stepwise logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the extent to which metabolites aid in the prediction of abruption. We evaluated the predictive performance of the set of selected metabolites using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC). Results Early pregnancy vaginal bleeding, dodecanoylcarnitine/dodecenoylcarnitine (C12 / C12:1), and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C 38:1 (PC ae C38:1) strongly predict abruption risk. The AUC for these metabolites alone was 0.68, for early pregnancy vaginal bleeding alone was 0.65, and combined the AUC improved to 0.75 with the addition of quantitative metabolite data (P = 0.003). Conclusion Metabolomic profiles of early pregnancy maternal serum samples in addition to the clinical symptom, vaginal bleeding, may serve as important markers for the prediction of abruption. Larger studies are necessary to corroborate and validate these findings in other cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2434556528,"Background 3D cell cultures are emerging as more physiologically meaningful alternatives to monolayer cultures for many biological applications. They are attractive because they more closely mimic in vivo morphology, especially when co-cultured with stromal fibroblasts. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the efficacy of 3 different 3D cell culture systems; collagen I, low attachment culture vessels and a modification of Fibrolife®, a specialised humanised cell culture medium devoid of animal-derived components, using breast cancer cell lines representative of the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, cultured alone or with human mammary fibroblasts with a view to developing matrix-free humanised systems. 3D collagen I culture supported the growth of a range of breast cancer cell lines. By modifying the composition of Fibrolife® to epiFL, matrix-free cell culture was possible. During sequential transfer to epiFL breast cancer cells gradually detached from the flask, growing progressively as spheroids. Phenotype was stable and reversible with cells remaining actively proliferating and easily accessible throughout culture. They could also be revived from frozen stocks. To achieve co-culture with fibroblasts in epiFL required use of low attachment culture vessels instead of standard plastic as fibroblasts remained adherent in epiFL. Here, cancer cell spheroids were allowed to form before adding fibroblasts. Immunohistochemical examination showed fibroblasts scattered throughout the epithelial spheroid, not dissimilar to the relationship of tumour stroma in human breast cancer. Conclusions Because of its ease of handling, matrix-free 3D cell culture may be a useful model to study the influence of fibroblasts on breast cancer epithelial cells with use of epiFL culture medium taking this a step further towards a fully humanised 3D model. This methodology could be applied to other types of cancer cell lines, making this a versatile technique for cancer researchers wishing to use in vitro systems that better reflect cancer in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2438587318,"Cross-cultural investigation of psychopathy measures is important for clarifying the nomological network surrounding the psychopathy construct. The Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R) is one of the most extensively researched self-report measures of psychopathic traits in adults. To date however, it has been examined primarily in North American criminal or student samples. To address this gap in the literature, we examined PPI-R's reliability, construct validity and factor structure in non-criminal individuals (N = 227) in Sweden, using a multimethod approach including psychophysiological correlates of empathy for pain. PPI-R construct validity was investigated in subgroups of participants by exploring its degree of overlap with (i) the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV), (ii) self-rated empathy and behavioral and physiological responses in an experiment on empathy for pain, and (iii) additional self-report measures of alexithymia and trait anxiety. The PPI-R total score was significantly associated with PCL:SV total and factor scores. The PPI-R Coldheartedness scale demonstrated significant negative associations with all empathy subscales and with rated unpleasantness and skin conductance responses in the empathy experiment. The PPI-R higher order Self-Centered Impulsivity and Fearless Dominance dimensions were associated with trait anxiety in opposite directions (positively and negatively, respectively). Overall, the results demonstrated solid reliability (test-retest and internal consistency) and promising but somewhat mixed construct validity for the Swedish translation of the PPI-R."
https://openalex.org/W2440592897,"Although deficits in facial affect processing have been reported in schizophrenia as well as in borderline personality disorder (BPD), these disorders have not yet been directly compared on facial affect labeling. Using degraded stimuli portraying neutral, angry, fearful and angry facial expressions, we hypothesized more errors in labeling negative facial expressions in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Patients with BPD were expected to have difficulty in labeling neutral expressions and to display a bias towards a negative attribution when wrongly labeling neutral faces. Patients with schizophrenia (N = 57) and patients with BPD (N = 30) were compared to patients with somatoform disorder (SoD, a psychiatric control group; N = 25) and healthy control participants (N = 41) on facial affect labeling accuracy and type of misattributions. Patients with schizophrenia showed deficits in labeling angry and fearful expressions compared to the healthy control group and patients with BPD showed deficits in labeling neutral expressions compared to the healthy control group. Schizophrenia and BPD patients did not differ significantly from each other when labeling any of the facial expressions. Compared to SoD patients, schizophrenia patients showed deficits on fearful expressions, but BPD did not significantly differ from SoD patients on any of the facial expressions. With respect to the type of misattributions, BPD patients mistook neutral expressions more often for fearful expressions compared to schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, and less often for happy compared to schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest that although schizophrenia and BPD patients demonstrate different as well as similar facial affect labeling deficits, BPD may be associated with a tendency to detect negative affect in neutral expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2433099156,"Lynch Syndrome (LS) is caused by pathogenic germline variants in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. However, up to 60% of MMR-deficient colorectal cancer cases are categorized as suspected Lynch Syndrome (sLS) because no pathogenic MMR germline variant can be identified, which leads to difficulties in clinical management. We therefore analyzed the genomic regions of 15 CRC susceptibility genes in leukocyte DNA of 34 unrelated sLS patients and 11 patients with MLH1 hypermethylated tumors with a clear family history.Using targeted next-generation sequencing, we analyzed the entire non-repetitive genomic sequence, including intronic and regulatory sequences, of 15 CRC susceptibility genes. In addition, tumor DNA from 28 sLS patients was analyzed for somatic MMR variants.Of 1979 germline variants found in the leukocyte DNA of 34 sLS patients, one was a pathogenic variant (MLH1 c.1667+1delG). Leukocyte DNA of 11 patients with MLH1 hypermethylated tumors was negative for pathogenic germline variants in the tested CRC susceptibility genes and for germline MLH1 hypermethylation. Somatic DNA analysis of 28 sLS tumors identified eight (29%) cases with two pathogenic somatic variants, one with a VUS predicted to pathogenic and LOH, and nine cases (32%) with one pathogenic somatic variant (n = 8) or one VUS predicted to be pathogenic (n = 1).This is the first study in sLS patients to include the entire genomic sequence of CRC susceptibility genes. An underlying somatic or germline MMR gene defect was identified in ten of 34 sLS patients (29%). In the remaining sLS patients, the underlying genetic defect explaining the MMRdeficiency in their tumors might be found outside the genomic regions harboring the MMR and other known CRC susceptibility genes."
https://openalex.org/W2427851317,"There is a need for a better understanding of transdiagnostic psychiatric symptoms that relate to neurophysiological abnormalities following rewarding and aversive feedback in order to inform development of novel targeted treatments. To address this need, we examined a transdiagnostic sample of 44 adults (mean age: 35.52; 57% female), which consisted of individuals with broadly-defined schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (n = 16), bipolar disorders (n = 10), other mood and anxiety disorders (n = 5), and no history of a psychiatric disorder (n = 13). Participants completed a Pavlovian monetary reward prediction task during 32-channel electroencephalogram recording. We assessed the event-related potentials (ERPs) of feedback-related negativity (FRN), feedback-related positivity (FRP), and the late positive potential (LPP), following better and worse than expected outcomes. Examination of symptom relationships using stepwise regressions across the entire sample revealed that an increase in the clinician-rated Negative Symptoms factor score from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, was related to a decreased LPP amplitude during better than expected (i.e., rewarding) outcomes. We also found that increased self-reported scores on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (Brief-Revised) Disorganized factor related to an increased FRN amplitude during worse than expected (i.e., aversive) outcomes. Across the entire sample, the FRP component amplitudes did not show significant relationships to any of the symptoms examined. Analyses of the three diagnostic groups of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, bipolar disorders, and nonpsychiatric controls did not reveal any statistically significant differences across the ERP amplitudes and conditions. These findings suggest relationships between specific neurophysiological abnormalities following rewarding and aversive outcomes and particular transdiagnostic psychiatric symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2501594743,"Lumen formation of breast epithelium is rapidly lost during tumorigenesis along with expression of cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1. CEACAM1 induces lumena in a three-dimensional culture of MCF7/CEACAM1 cells that otherwise fail to form lumena. We hypothesized miRNAs may be involved because >400 genes were up- or down-regulated in MCF7/CEACAM1 cells and miRNAs may modify global expression patterns. Comparative analysis of miRNA expression in MCF7 versus MCF7/CEACAM1 cells revealed two miRNAs significantly down-regulated (hsa-miR-30a-3p by 6.73-fold and hsa-miR-342–5p by 5.68-fold). Location of miR-342 within an intron of the EVL gene, hypermethylated and involved in tumorigenesis, suggested that miR-342 overexpression may block lumen formation. In fact, overexpression of miR-342 in MCF7/CEACAM1 cells significantly blocked lumen formation (p < 0.001). ID4, a dominant-negative inhibitor of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, up-regulated in MCF7/CEACAM1 cells, down-regulated in breast cancer, and containing a miR-342 binding site, was tested as a potential target of miR-342. The ratio of ID4 to miR-342 increased from 1:2 in MCF7 cells to 30:1 in MCF7/CEACAM1 cells and a miR-342 inhibitor was able to induce 3′-UTR ID4 reporter activity in MCF7 cells. Because 5-methylcytosine methyltransferase DNMT1 is also a potential target of miR-342, we inhibited miR-342 in MCF7 cells and found DNMT1 was up-regulated with no change in EVL expression, suggesting that miR-342 regulates DNMT1 expression but DNMT1 does not affect the EVL expression in these cells. We conclude that the regulation of lumen formation by miR-342 involves at least two of its known targets, namely ID4 and DNMT1.

https://openalex.org/W2420824719,"An important feature of a potential vaccine against HIV is the production of broadly neutralising antibodies (BrNAbs) capable of potentially blocking infectivity of a diverse array of HIV strains. BrNAbs naturally arise in some HIV infected individuals after several years of infection and their serum IgG can neutralise various HIV strains across different subtypes. We previously showed that vaccination of cows with HIV gp140 AD8 trimers resulted in a high titre of serum IgG against HIV envelope (Env) that had strong BrNAb activity. These polyclonal BrNAbs concentrated into the colostrum during the late stage of pregnancy and can be harvested in vast quantities immediately after calving. In this study, we investigated the effect of prolonged HIV gp140 vaccination on bovine colostrum IgG HIV Env-binding and BrNAb activity over subsequent pregnancies. Repeated immunisation led to a maintained high titre of HIV Env specific IgG in the colostrum batches, but this did not increase through repeated cycles. Colostrum IgG from all batches also strongly competed with sCD4 binding to gp140 Env trimer and with human-derived monoclonal VRC01 and b12 BrNAbs that bind the CD4 binding site (CD4bs). Furthermore, competition neutralisation assays using RSC3 Env gp120 protein core and a derivative CD4bs mutant, RSC3 Δ371I/P363N, showed that CD4bs neutralising antibodies contribute to the neutralising activity of all batches of purified bovine colostrum IgG. This result indicates that the high IgG titre/avidity of anti-CD4bs antibodies with BrNAb activity was achieved during the first year of vaccination and was sustained throughout the years of repeated vaccinations in the cow tested. Although IgG of subsequent colostrum batches may have a higher avidity towards the CD4bs, the overall breadth in neutralisation was not enhanced. This implies that the boosting vaccinations over 4 years elicited a polyclonal antibody response that maintained the proportion of both neutralising and non-neutralising CD4bs antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2440949731,"The rice gene seed dormancy 4 (OsSdr4) functions in seed dormancy and is a major factor associated with pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). Although previous studies of this protein family were reported for rice and other species, knowledge of the evolution of genes homologous to OsSdr4 in plants remains inadequate. Fifty four Sdr4-like (hereafter designated Sdr4L) genes were identified in nine plant lineages including 36 species. Phylogenetic analysis placed these genes in eight subfamilies (I-VIII). Genes from the same lineage clustered together, supported by analysis of conserved motifs and exon-intron patterns. Segmental duplications were present in both dicot and monocot clusters, while tandemly duplicated genes occurred only in monocot clusters indicating that both tandem and segmental duplications contributed to expansion of the grass I and II subfamilies. Estimation of the approximate ages of the duplication events indicated that ancestral Sdr4 genes evolved from a common angiosperm ancestor, about 160 million years ago (MYA). Moreover, diversification of Sdr4L genes in mono and dicot plants was mainly associated with genome-wide duplication and speciation events. Functional divergence was observed in all subfamily pairs, except IV/VIIIa. Further analysis indicated that functional constraints between subfamily pairs I/II, I/VIIIb, II/VI, II/VIIIb, II/IV, and VI/VIIIb were statistically significant. Site and branch-site model analyses of positive selection suggested that these genes were under strong adaptive selection pressure. Critical amino acids detected for both functional divergence and positive selection were mostly located in the loops, pointing to functional importance of these regions in this protein family. In addition, differential expression studies by transcriptome atlas of 11 Sdr4L genes showed that the duplicated genes may have undergone divergence in expression between plant species. Our findings showed that Sdr4L genes are functionally divergent and positively selected. These may contribute to further functional analysis and molecular evolution of Sdr4L gene families in land plants."

Ten-day old mice carrying one copy of human rhodopsin with the P23H mutation and both copies of wild-type mouse rhodopsin (hP23H RHO+/-,mRHO+/+) were injected into the quadriceps with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) carrying either enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or EpoR76E. Visual function (electroretinogram) and retina structure (optical coherence tomography, histology, and immunohistochemistry) were assessed at 7 and 12 months of age.


Results 
The outer nuclear layer thickness decreased over time at a slower rate in rAAV.EpoR76E treated as compared to the rAAV.eGFP injected mice. There was a statistically significant preservation of the electroretinogram at 7, but not 12 months of age.


Conclusions 
Systemic EPO-R76E slows death of the photoreceptors and vision loss in hP23H RHO+/-,mRHO+/+ mice. Treatment with EPO-R76E may widen the therapeutic window for retinal degeneration patients by increasing the number of viable cells. Future studies might investigate if co-treatment with EPO-R76E and gene replacement therapy is more effective than gene replacement therapy alone."
https://openalex.org/W2433224280,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a multifunctional cytokine that exerts potent context specific immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects. We have investigated the mechanism by which PEGylated rIL-10 regulates plasma cholesterol in mice and humans. In agreement with previous work on rIL-10, we report that PEGylated rIL-10 harnesses the myeloid immune system to control total plasma cholesterol levels. We have discovered that PEG-rMuIL-10's dramatic lowering of plasma cholesterol is dependent on phagocytotic cells. In particular, PEG-rHuIL-10 enhances cholesterol uptake by Kupffer cells. In addition, removal of phagocytotic cells dramatically increases plasma cholesterol levels, suggesting for the first time that immunological cells are implicitly involved in regulating total cholesterol levels. These data suggest that treatment with PEG-rIL-10 potentiates endogenous cholesterol regulating cell populations not currently targeted by standard of care therapeutics. Furthermore, we show that IL-10's increase of Kupffer cell cholesterol phagocytosis is concomitant with decreases in liver cholesterol and triglycerides. This leads to the reversal of early periportal liver fibrosis and facilitates the restoration of liver health. These data recommend PEG-rIL-10 for evaluation in the treatment of fatty liver disease and preventing its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In direct confirmation of our in vivo findings in the treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice with PEG-rMuIL-10, we report that treatment of hypercholesterolemic cancer patients with PEG-rHuIL-10 lowers total plasma cholesterol by up to 50%. Taken together these data suggest that PEG-rIL-10's cholesterol regulating biology is consistent between mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2437830392,"Meniscal lesions are common and may contribute to the development of knee arthrosis. A few case-control and cross-sectional studies have identified knee-straining work as risk factors for meniscal lesions, but exposure-response relations and the role of specific exposures are uncertain, and previous results may be sensitive to reporting and selection bias. We examined the relation between meniscal lesions and cumulative exposure to heavy lifting in a prospective register-based study with complete follow-up and independent information on exposure and outcome. We established a cohort of unskilled men employed at Copenhagen Airport or in other companies in the metropolitan Copenhagen area from 1990 to 2012 (the Copenhagen Airport Cohort). The cohort at risk included 3,307 airport baggage handlers with heavy lifting and kneeling or squatting work tasks and 63,934 referents with a similar socioeconomic background and less knee-straining work. Baggage handlers lifted suitcases with an average weight of approximately 15 kg, in total approximately five tonnes during a 9-hour workday. The cohort was followed in the National Patient Register and Civil Registration System. The outcome was a first time hospital diagnosis or surgery of a meniscal lesion. Baggage handlers had a higher incidence of meniscal lesions than the referents. Within baggage handlers spline regression showed that the incidence rate ratio was 1.91 (95% confidence interval: 1.29–2.84) after five years as a baggage handler and then decreased slowly to reach unity after approximately 30 years, adjusted for effects of potential confounders. This relation between baggage handling and meniscal lesions was present for work on the apron which involves lifting in a kneeling or squatting position, but not in the baggage hall, which only involves lifting in standing positions. The results support that long-term heavy lifting in a kneeling or squatting position is a risk factor for the development of symptomatic meniscal lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2423677387,"PA subunit of influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase deserves constantly increasing attention due to its essential role in influenza life cycle. N-terminal domain of PA (PA-Nter) harbors endonuclease activity, which is indispensable in viral transcription and replication. Interestingly, existing literature reports on in vitro ion preferences of the enzyme are contradictory. Some show PA-Nter activity exclusively with Mn2+, whereas others report Mg2+ as a natural cofactor. To clarify it, we performed a series of experiments with varied ion concentrations and substrate type. We observed cleavage in the presence of both ions, with a slight preference for manganese, however PA-Nter activity highly depended on the amount of residual, co-purified ions. Furthermore, to quantify cleavage reaction rate, we applied fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), providing highly sensitive and real-time monitoring of single molecules. Using nanomolar ssDNA in the regime of enzyme excess, we estimated the maximum reaction rate at 0.81± 0.38 and 1.38± 0.34 nM/min for Mg2+ and Mn2+, respectively. However, our calculations of PA-Nter ion occupancy, based on thermodynamic data, suggest Mg2+ to be a canonical metal in PA-Nter processing of RNA in vivo. Presented studies constitute a step toward better understanding of PA-Nter ion-dependent activity, which will possibly contribute to new successful inhibitor design in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2426780716,"Objective To measure Met protein content in prostate biopsies guided by fused magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging, and to measure soluble Met (sMet) protein concentration in plasma samples from patients presenting evidence of prostate cancer. Patients and Methods 345 patients had plasma samples drawn prior to image-guided biopsy of the prostate. Of these, 32% had benign biopsies. Of the 236 that were positive for prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa), 132 treated by total prostatectomy had Gleason scores of 6 (17%), 7, (55%), 8 (16%), or 9–10 (12%). 23% had evidence of local invasion. Plasma samples were also obtained from 80 healthy volunteers. Tissue Met and plasma sMet were measured by two-site immunoassay; values were compared among clinically defined groups using non-parametric statistical tests to determine significant differences or correlations. Results PCa tumor Met correlated significantly with plasma sMet, but median values were similar among benign and malignant groups. Median plasma sMet values were also similar among those groups, although both medians were significantly above normal. Median Met content in primary PCa tumors and sMet concentrations were independent of Gleason score, final pathologic stage and age. Conclusion Plasma sMet is not predictive of PCa or its severity in patients with organ-confined or locally invasive disease. Quantitative analysis of Met protein content and activation state in PCa tumor biopsy samples was highly feasible and may have value in follow-up to genomic and/or transcriptomic-based screens that show evidence of oncogenically relevant MET gene features that occur at relatively low frequency in non-metastatic PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2436706729,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with a broad range of frontal lobe dysfunctions. However, no study has investigated action monitoring, a crucial domain of frontal cognitive functions, in patients with OSA. By using the modified Flanker task, we tested the hypothesis that patients with OSA have an impaired action monitoring function. We recruited 25 untreated patients with moderate-severe OSA and 12 control participants who were matched for age, sex, apolipoprotein E4, and education level. Every enrolled participant underwent a standard overnight laboratory-based polysomnography and completed a modified Flanker task. Compared with the controls, the patients with OSA presented a significantly lower correct response rate in all trials (78.9% vs 95.9%, P = .008), congruent trials (84.7% vs 98.3%, P = .016), and incongruent trials (77.4% vs 94.7%, P = .009). The post-error correction rate was significantly lower in the patients with OSA than in the controls (74.9% vs 93.8%, P = .005). Furthermore, strong significant correlations were observed between the arousal index and correct rate in all trials (r = -0.390, P < .05) and in the incongruent trials (r = -0.429, P < .01), as well as between the arousal index and rate of post-error correction (r = -0.435, P < .01). We concluded that the action monitoring function was impaired in the patients with OSA. Sleep fragmentation was a major determinant of impaired action monitoring in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2442389477,"Concomitant loss of lumen formation and cell adhesion protein CEACAM1 is a hallmark feature of breast cancer. In a three-dimensional culture model, transfection of CEACAM1 into MCF7 breast cells can restore lumen formation by an unknown mechanism. ID4, a transcriptional regulator lacking a DNA binding domain, is highly up-regulated in CEACAM1-transfected MCF7 cells, and when down-regulated with RNAi, abrogates lumen formation. Conversely, when MCF7 cells, which fail to form lumena in a three-dimensional culture, are transfected with ID4, lumen formation is restored, demonstrating that ID4 may substitute for CEACAM1. After showing the ID4 promoter is hypermethylated in MCF7 cells but hypomethylated in MCF/CEACAM1 cells, ID4 expression was induced in MCF7 cells by agents affecting chromatin remodeling and methylation. Mechanistically, CaMK2D was up-regulated in CEACAM1-transfected cells, effecting phosphorylation of HDAC4 and its sequestration in the cytoplasm by the adaptor protein 14-3-3. CaMK2D also phosphorylates CEACAM1 on its cytoplasmic domain and mutation of these phosphorylation sites abrogates lumen formation. Thus, CEACAM1 is able to maintain the active transcription of ID4 by an epigenetic mechanism involving HDAC4 and CaMK2D, and the same kinase enables lumen formation by CEACAM1. Because ID4 can replace CEACAM1 in parental MCF7 cells, it must act downstream from CEACAM1 by inhibiting the activity of other transcription factors that would otherwise prevent lumen formation. This overall mechanism may be operative in other cancers, such as colon and prostate, where the down-regulation of CEACAM1 is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2428189527,"Fracture mechanisms of an enamel-like hydroxyapatite-collagen composite model are elaborated by means of molecular and coarse-grained dynamics simulation. Using fully atomistic models, we uncover molecular-scale plastic deformation and fracture processes initiated at the organic-inorganic interface. Furthermore, coarse-grained models are developed to investigate fracture patterns at the μm-scale. At the meso-scale, micro-fractures are shown to reduce local stress and thus prevent material failure after loading beyond the elastic limit. On the basis of our multi-scale simulation approach, we provide a molecular scale rationalization of this phenomenon, which seems key to the resilience of hierarchical biominerals, including teeth and bone."
https://openalex.org/W2429015988,"Antigen-antibody complexes are central players in an effective immune response. However, finding those interactions relevant to a particular disease state can be arduous. Nonetheless many paths to discovery have been explored since deciphering these interactions can greatly facilitate the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. In silico B cell epitope mapping approaches have been widely pursued, though success has not been consistent. Antibody mixtures in immune sera have been used as handles for biologically relevant antigens, but these and other experimental approaches have proven resource intensive and time consuming. In addition, these methods are often tailored to individual diseases or a specific proteome, rather than providing a universal platform. Most of these methods are not able to identify the specific antibody's epitopes from unknown antigens, such as un-annotated neo antigens in cancer. Alternatively, a peptide library comprised of sequences unrestricted by naturally-found protein space provides for a universal search for mimotopes of an antibody's epitope. Here we present the utility of such a non-natural random sequence library of 10,000 peptides physically addressed on a microarray for mimotope discovery without sequence information of the specific antigen. The peptide arrays were probed with serum from an antigen-immunized rabbit, or alternatively probed with serum pre-absorbed with the same immunizing antigen. With this positive and negative screening scheme, we identified the library-peptides as the mimotopes of the antigen. The unique library peptides were successfully used to isolate antigen-specific antibodies from complete immune serum. Sequence analysis of these peptides revealed the epitopes in the immunized antigen. We present this method as an inexpensive, efficient method for identifying mimotopes of any antibody's targets. These mimotopes should be useful in defining both components of the antigen-antibody complex."
https://openalex.org/W2427184700,"Genetic pathways that regulate nascent neurite formation play a critical role in neuronal morphogenesis. The core planar cell polarity components VANG-1/Van Gogh and PRKL-1/Prickle are involved in blocking inappropriate neurite formation in a subset of motor neurons in C. elegans. A genetic screen for mutants that display supernumerary neurites was performed to identify additional factors involved in this process. This screen identified mutations in fntb-1, the β subunit of farnesyltransferase. We show that fntb-1 is expressed in neurons and acts cell-autonomously to regulate neurite formation. Prickle proteins are known to be post-translationally modified by farnesylation at their C-terminal CAAX motifs. We show that PRKL-1 can be recruited to the plasma membrane in both a CAAX-dependent and CAAX-independent manner but that PRKL-1 can only inhibit neurite formation in a CAAX-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2438373046,"While the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain by controlling the access of solutes and toxic substances to brain, it also limits drug entry to treat central nervous system disorders. Many drugs are substrates for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters at the BBB that limit their entry into the brain. The role of those transporters in limiting the entry of the widely prescribed therapeutic, benzylpenicillin, has produced conflicting results. This study investigated the possible potential involvement of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), two ABC transporters, in benzylpenicillin transport at BBB in human using MDCKII cells overexpressing those transporters as well as pharmacological inhibition. MDCKII cells overexpressing human BCRP (MDCKII-BCRP) but not those overexpressing human P-gp (MDCKII-MDR cells) had reduced [3H]benzylpenicillin uptake. Similarly, inhibiting BCRP increased [3H]benzylpenicillin uptake in MDCKII-BCRP cells, while inhibiting P-gp in MDCKII-MDR cells had no effect on uptake although there was evidence that benzylpenicillin is a substrate for canine P-gp. While inhibiting BCRP affected [3H]benzylpenicillin cell concentrations it did not affect transepithelial flux in MDCKII-BCRP cells. In summary, the results indicate that human BCRP and not human P-gp is involved in benzylpenicillin transport. However, targeting BCRP alone was not sufficient to alter transepithelial flux in MDCKII cells. Whether it would be sufficient to alter blood-to-brain flux at the human BBB remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2428358966,"Neurological examination, including visual fixation and tracking of a target, is routinely performed in the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit postnatal care units on the Thailand-Myanmar border. We aimed to evaluate a simple visual newborn test developed in Italy and performed by non-specialized personnel working in neonatal care units. An intensive training of local health staff in Thailand was conducted prior to performing assessments at 24, 48 and 72 hours of life in healthy, low-risk term singletons. The 48 and 72 hours results were then compared to values obtained to those from Italy. Parents and staff administering the test reported on acceptability. One hundred and seventy nine newborns, between June 2011 and October 2012, participated in the study. The test was rapidly completed if the infant remained in an optimal behavioral stage (7 ± 2 minutes) but the test duration increased significantly (12 ± 4 minutes, p < 0.001) if its behavior changed. Infants were able to fix a target and to discriminate a colored face at 24 hours of life. Horizontal tracking of a target was achieved by 96% (152/159) of the infants at 48 hours. Circular tracking, stripe discrimination and attention to distance significantly improved between each 24-hour test period. The test was easily performed by non-specialized local staff and well accepted by the parents. Healthy term singletons in this limited-resource setting have a visual response similar to that obtained to gestational age matched newborns in Italy. It is possible to use these results as a reference set of values for the visual assessment in Karen and Burmese infants in the first 72 hours of life. The utility of the 24 hours test should be pursued."
