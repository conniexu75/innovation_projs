https://openalex.org/W4238642012,"Liquid water consists of a macroscopically connected, random network of hydrogen bonds, with frequent strained and broken bonds, that is continually undergoing topological reformation. Anomalous properties of water arise from the competition between relatively bulky ways of connecting molecules into local patterns characterized by strong bonds and nearly tetrahedral angles and more compact arrangements characterized by more strain and bond breakage. However, these alternatives constitute virtually a continuum of architectural possibilities rather than a discrete pair of options. The singular behavior of supercooled water near –45°C and the ""hydrophobic"" attraction between nonpolar entities are due to the same underlying phenomenon, namely, the clumping tendency of relatively strain-free convex cages or polyhedra."

https://openalex.org/W2051234317,"A new bioassay for comparing the palatability to avian predators of monarch butterflies reared on various asclepiadaceous food plants containing cardiac glycosides indicates a palatability spectrum. The monarchs reared on one plant species are six times as emetic as those fed another, while those raised on an asclepiad which lacks cardiac glycosides are not emetic at all."

The bulk chemical composition, mineralogy, and mineral chemistry indicate that this chondritic material has properties intermediate between those of the H-group chondrites and those of the enstatite chondrites."
https://openalex.org/W2055640341,"The rates of oxygenation and deoxygenation of a series of iridium complexes increase and decrease, respectively, with increasing electron-releasing tendency of the anionic ligands (A) attached to the metal atom in the oxygencarrying compounds, [IrA(CO)(Ph(3)P)(2)]. Calculated heats of oxygenation (-DeltaH(2)(0)), related to Ir-O(2) bond energies, are proportional to the previously reported O-O bond lengths in the oxygen adducts, [O(2)IrA(CO)(Ph(3)P)(2)]."
https://openalex.org/W2062016474,"Fission-track dating of basaltic glass from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge gives results which are consistent with the proposal of ocean-floor spreading. Solidification ages from ~10,000 years to ~300,000 years were measured. Correlation is also possible between the magnetic anomaly patterns over the Crest Mountains at 45 degrees N and the geochronology of the outcropping basalts. Renewed volcanic activity well removed from the axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has been demonstrated to have taken place in recent times."

https://openalex.org/W2041399971,The distribution of magnesium and iron over the M1 and M2 positions in Bamle enstatite shocked at 1 megabar is highly disordered. It corresponds to an equilibrium distribution of at least 1000 degrees C. The distribution in samples shocked at 450 kilobars or less is undisturbed.

https://openalex.org/W2073108707,"If, as seems likely, a comprehensive law-of-the-sea treaty is successfully concluded, minerals of the continental margins would be almost entirely controlled by coastal nations, and the right to produce minerals of the deep ocean floor would be licensed by an International Seabed Authority. Mineral production from the continental margins is likely to increase and diversify with time. The only minerals from the deep ocean floor for which there are reasonably good prospects of production within the next decade are the metalliferous muds from some of the deeps in the Red Sea (which lie within what is likely to be the jurisdiction of Saudi Arabia and Sudan) and nodules in the northeastern equatorial Pacific that contain recoverable metals, namely nickel, copper, cobalt, and possibly manganese, molybdenum, and vanadium."
https://openalex.org/W1964956972,"Potassium-argon dates obtained from extrusives collected on a traverse across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 45 degrees N are consistent with the hypothesis of ocean-floor spreading. The dates suggest a spreading rate in the range of 2.6 to 3.2 centimeters per year near the axis of the ridge; the rate agrees with that computed from fission-track dating of basalt glasses. Additional data for a basalt collected 62 kilometers west of the axis gives a spreading rate of 0.8 centimeter per year, which is similar to the rate inferred from magnetic anomaly patterns in the area. Reasons for the difference in calculated spreading rates are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2054169052,Ancient mosaic patterns tend to be certain absolute sizes (mosaic units). There is evidence that the mosaicists had these lengths marked on rulers. A ruler such as one which an ancient mosaicist might have used has been reconstructed. It is possible that an original may still exist.
