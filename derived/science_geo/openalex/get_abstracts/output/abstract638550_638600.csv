In plants, disease resistance is often conferred by nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, intracellular immune receptors that recognize pathogen proteins and their effects on the host. Consistent with extensive balancing and positive selection, NLRs are encoded by one of the most variable gene families in plants, but the true extent of intraspecific NLR diversity has been unclear. Here, we define a nearly complete species-wide pan-NLRome in Arabidopsis thaliana based on sequence enrichment and long-read sequencing. The pan-NLRome largely saturates with approximately 40 well-chosen wild strains, with half of the pan-NLRome being present in most accessions. We chart NLR architectural diversity, identify new architectures, and quantify selective forces that act on specific NLRs and NLR domains. Our study provides a blueprint for defining pan-NLRomes.

Plant immunity relies critically on a repertoire of immunity receptors whose diversity has been shaped by eons of plant-microbe coevolution. Two classes of receptors can activate immune signaling: cell-surface proteins that recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and intracellular proteins that detect pathogen effectors (Dangl et al., 2013Dangl J.L. Horvath D.M. Staskawicz B.J. Pivoting the plant immune system from dissection to deployment.Science. 2013; 341: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). A large portion of the latter class comprises nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). These are encoded by highly polymorphic genes that represent the majority of genetically defined disease-resistance loci (Jones et al., 2016Jones J.D.G. Vance R.E. Dangl J.L.

Most plant NLRs contain a central nucleotide-binding domain shared by Apaf-1, resistance proteins, and CED4 (NB-ARC, hereafter NB for simplicity), and either a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) or coiled-coil (CC) domain at the N terminus (Jones et al., 2016Jones J.D.G.

Proteins with similar arrangements of functional domains are involved in host defenses of animals and fungi (Jones et al., 2016Jones J.D.G. Vance R.E. Dangl J.L.

Do fungi have an innate immune response? An NLR-based comparison to plant and animal immune systems.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13: e1006578Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similar to animal NLRs, plant NLRs appear to form inflammasome-like structures, or resistosomes, that control cell death following pathogen recognition (Wang et al., 2019aWang J. Wang J. Hu M. Wu S. Qi J. Wang G. Han Z. Qi Y. Gao N.

Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity.Science. 2019; 364: eaav5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Pathogen recognition by plant NLRs generally involves one of at least three main mechanisms (Kourelis and van der Hoorn, 2018Kourelis J. van der Hoorn R.A.L. Defended to the Nines: 25 Years of Resistance Gene Cloning Identifies Nine Mechanisms for R Protein Function.Plant Cell. 2018; 30: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NLRs can detect pathogen effectors indirectly by monitoring how they modify host targets, known as NLR guardees. Alternatively, direct detection of pathogen effectors occurs either through interaction of effectors with any of the three canonical NLR domains or through interaction of effectors with integrated domains (IDs) that resemble bona fide host targets and act as target decoys. Because of their importance in ecology and breeding, there has been much interest in defining inventories of NLR genes at different taxonomic levels. These efforts have revealed that the number of NLR genes across species varies from fewer than a hundred to over a thousand (Yue et al., 2012Yue J.-X. Meyers B.C. Chen J.-Q. Tian D. Yang S.

While there has been substantial progress at higher taxonomic levels, a thorough understanding of NLR diversity within species has unfortunately been hindered by the extraordinarily polymorphic nature of the gene family, and its extensive pervasive presence-absence polymorphic variation even between closely related individuals. Early intraspecific diversity studies revealed patterns of allelic and structural variation consistent with adaptive evolution and balancing selection for subsets of NLR genes (Bakker et al., 2008Bakker E.G. Traw M.B. Toomajian C. Kreitman M. Bergelson J. Low levels of polymorphism in genes that control the activation of defense response in Arabidopsis thaliana.Genetics. 2008; 178: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), fitting a model of co-evolution of host and pathogens. Some loci can have many different haplotypes, in some instances even reflecting true allelic series (Allen et al., 2004Allen R.L. Bittner-Eddy P.D. Grenville-Briggs L.J. Meitz J.C. Rehmany A.P.

A further complication is that many NLR genes are arranged in clusters with extensive copy-number variation (Chae et al., 2014Chae E. Bomblies K. Kim S.T. Karelina D. Zaidem M. Ossowski S.

Together with ubiquitous presence-absence polymorphisms, this implies that reference genomes likely include only a fraction of distinct NLR genes within a species, which in turn has made it impossible to obtain a clear picture of NLR diversity based on resequencing efforts. To remedy this gap in our knowledge of NLR gene evolution, resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq) has been developed, which is especially powerful when combined with long read technology (Witek et al., 2016aWitek K. Jupe F. Witek A.I. Baker D. Clark M.D. Jones J.D.G. Accelerated cloning of a potato late blight-resistance gene using RenSeq and SMRT sequencing.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we present a substantial step toward defining the full NLR repertoire, or pan-NLRome, and its variability in the reference species Arabidopsis thaliana, by analyzing a highly curated diversity panel of 64 accessions. Despite the extreme diversity of NLR complements when comparing only a few individuals, discovery of the pan-NLRome of this species approached saturation with about 40 well-chosen accessions. The sequences we obtained allow us to define the core NLR complement, chart integrated domain diversity, describe new domain architectures, assess presence-absence polymorphisms in non-core NLRs, and map uncharacterized NLRs onto the A. thaliana Col-0 reference genome. Together, our work provides a foundation for the identification and functional study of disease-resistance genes in agronomically important species with more complex genomes. We selected 64 A. thaliana accessions for RenSeq analysis. Of those, 46 were from the 1001 Genomes Project collection (1001 Genomes Consortium, 20161001 Genomes Consortium1,135 Genomes Reveal the Global Pattern of Polymorphism in Arabidopsis thaliana.Cell. 2016; 166: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), with 26 representing non-relict accessions, several of which have informative disease-resistance phenotypes, and 20 belonging to relict populations characterized by an unusually high amount of genetic diversity. A further 18 of the accessions are founders of multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) lines (Kover et al., 2009Kover P.X. Valdar W. Trakalo J. Scarcelli N. Ehrenreich I.M. Purugganan M.D. Durrant C. Mott R. A Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross to fine-map quantitative traits in Arabidopsis thaliana.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000551Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A; Table S1). One MAGIC accession was sampled twice due to a mislabeled seed stock (total number of datasets was thus 65). RenSeq baits were designed to hybridize with 736 NLR-coding genes from multiple Brassicaceae, including A. thaliana, A. lyrata, Brassica rapa, Aethionema arabicum, and Eutrema parvulum. RenSeq was combined with single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to reconstruct 65 NLR complements, resulting in 13,167 annotated NLR genes, with a range of 167 to 251 genes per accession (Figure 1B). We report the annotated RenSeq sequences and identifiers also for the reference accession Col-0, but for downstream analyses, we used TAIR10 and Araport 11 identifiers and sequences for Col-0 (Cheng et al., 2017Cheng C.-Y. Krishnakumar V. Chan A.P. Thibaud-Nissen F. Schobel S. Town C.D.

Adopting a definition of NLR clusters as genes within 200 kb of each other in the genome (Holub, 2001Holub E.B. The arms race is ancient history in Arabidopsis, the wildflower.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 516-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), 47%–71% of NLR genes in each accession were located in such clusters. A particularly interesting subset of NLR genes are those in head-to-head orientation, termed paired NLRs (Narusaka et al., 2009Narusaka M. Shirasu K. Noutoshi Y. Kubo Y. Shiraishi T. Iwabuchi M.

Commun. 2015; 6: 6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We found 10–34 such NLRs per accession. NLRs were grouped into the four classes: TIR-NLR (TNL), CC-NLR (CNL), CCR-NLR (RNL), and NB-and-LRR-only proteins (NL), based on canonical NLR domains TIR, CC, RPW8-like coiled-coil (CCR), NB, and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Most NLR genes in each accession were TNLs, which also were the most variable in overall gene number, followed by NLs, CNLs, and RNLs (Figures 1C and S1). Of the 13,167 NLR genes, 663 encoded at least one non-canonical NLR domain, or ID, representing 36 distinct Pfam domains (Figures 2A–2C; Tables S2A and S3A). Individual accessions had 5–17 IDs distributed across 4–16 NLR genes, including several IDs not reported before in A. thaliana or other Brassicaceae. Of the 36 IDs, 29 were already known from other Brassicaceae including the A. thaliana reference accession Col-0 (Figures 2A and 2B; Tables S2A–S2C and S3B). Nine had been reported concordantly in two major genome-wide NLR-ID surveys (Kroj et al., 2016Kroj T. Chanclud E. Michel-Romiti C. Grand X. Morel J.-B.

Rediscovery of these nine IDs is of particular relevance, since they are enriched for domains similar to known effector targets (Kroj et al., 2016Kroj T. Chanclud E. Michel-Romiti C. Grand X.

Note that singleton IDs, defined as those that were found in only one NLR gene model in one accession, were not considered further, to minimize the effects of potential annotation artifacts on our analyses. A hallmark of NLRome diversity across species is the variation in the relative fraction of different domain architectures (Li et al., 2015Li X. Kapos P. Zhang Y. NLRs in plants.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2015; 32: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, Sarris et al., 2016Sarris P.F. Cevik V. Dagdas G. Jones J.D.G. Krasileva K.V.

Evol. 2016; 33: 2692-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We identified 97 distinct architectures in the A. thaliana pan-NLRome, of which only 22 were found in the Col-0 reference genome and only 48 had been reported in Col-0 or other Brassicaceae (Figures 2D and S2; Table S2D). Fewer than a third of architectures, 27, corresponded to different configurations of the canonical TIR, CC, CCR, NB, and LRR domains, even though they accounted for the vast majority, 95%, of NLRs. The remaining 5% of NLRs had all at least 1 of 36 different IDs, with most of the ID-containing architectures not seen before in A. thaliana (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2C). Half of the new A. thaliana architectures, 38 out of 75, were represented by more than one gene (Figure S2C). Many of these, 17, comprised paired NLRs with at least one ID (Figure 2E). All but 1 of the 175 NLR genes with new architectures contained an ID, and together they made up 1.3% of the pan-NLRome (Figures 2D and 2E; Tables S2D–S2F). Finally, 12 IDs were found in more than one new architecture (Figure 2F; Tables S2E and S2F), reflecting the recycling of a limited set of IDs into new domain arrangements. Coincidentally, since it is likely that IDs are derived from proteins repeatedly targeted by pathogen effectors, their identification provides leads for the identification of new pathogen effector targets, even though only the TCP domain has been found in a large interaction screen with diverse pathogen effectors (Weßling et al., 2014Weßling R. Epple P. Altmann S. He Y. Yang L. Henz S.R. McDonald N. Wiley K. Bader K.C.

To understand both the variation in NLR content and diversity of NLR alleles, we clustered NLRs from different accessions into orthogroups (OGs) based on sequence similarity. Only a little more than 10% of all NLRs, 1,663, were singletons, with the rest, 11,497, falling into 1 of 464 OGs. The OG size distribution of these 464 non-singleton OGs is shown in Figure 3A. Of the OGs, 95% could be discovered with 38 randomly chosen accessions (Figure 3B). Additional sampling only recovered OGs with three or fewer members, indicating that the pan-NLRome we describe is largely saturated. OGs were classified according to size, domain architecture, and structural features. The core NLRome could be defined with merely 106 OGs (23%), comprising 6,080 (53%) genes, that were found in at least 52 accessions. A slightly higher number, 143 (31%) OGs, with 3,932 (34%) genes, were found in at least 13 but fewer than 52 accessions, a class that we considered the shell NLRome. Finally, 46% of all OGs, 215, which included 1,485 (13%) genes, were found in 12 or fewer accessions, constituting the cloud NLRome (Figure 3A). The majority of OGs, 58%, were TNLs, in agreement with TNLs being the prevalent NLR class in the Brassicaceae (Guo et al., 2011Guo Y.-L. Fitz J. Schneeberger K. Ossowski S. Cao J. Weigel D.

Specific TNLs were missing from accessions on average less often than CNLs, reflected in CNL OGs being much more likely to be part of the cloud pan-NLRome (Figures 3C and 3E). 64 OGs included genetically paired NLRs, and 28 contained members with an ID, with almost all belonging to the shell or core NLRome (Figures 3D, 3G, and 3H). In general, NLR clusters and pairs as well as ID-containing NLRs were not only widely distributed in the population, but both were also on average more conserved than unpaired NLRs or those without IDs (Figures 3D–3H). We tested for each shell or core OG whether the topology of its phylogeny could be linked to available metadata, such as subclass membership or expression across accessions. With stringent filtering criteria, we found 56 such associations for 68 OGs, with 16 OGs having multiple associations (Table S4I). The most frequently associated metadata types were relic classification (50; e.g., OG40.1), domain architecture (11; e.g., OG172.1), NLR subclass (10; e.g., OG174.1), and the pattern of surrounding transposable elements (10; e.g., OG160.1). An association with resistance to Albugo candida (AcEx1) was found twice (OG16.10 and OG284.1). None of the OGs showed a strong association with expression pattern, population classification, or geographic origin of accessions. Previous studies, such as the one of Kuang and colleagues (Kuang et al., 2004Kuang H. Woo S.S. Meyers B.C. Nevo E. Michelmore R.W. Multiple genetic processes result in heterogeneous rates of evolution within the major cluster disease resistance genes in lettuce.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2870-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), found that some NLR loci feature signs of frequent sequence exchange between paralogs (type I), whereas others have a more obvious allelic pattern (type II). We could identify clear allelic series for 86% of OGs, but 14% of OGs appeared initially as overclustered (i.e., including non-allelic genes). Such overclustering could reflect high sequence similarity because of frequent exchange between paralogs or recent duplication events, or in other words, being consistent with potential type I loci. Among these initially overclustered loci, we found the RPP8/RCY1/HRT, RPP4/5, and RPP7/TuNI OGs. These loci constitute all three known examples in A. thaliana, where different paralogs confer resistance to different classes of pathogens, or distinct effectors from the same pathogen, a sign of neo-functionalization (Asai et al., 2019Asai S.

https://openalex.org/W2969843240,"TRPA1 is a chemosensory ion channel that functions as a sentinel for structurally diverse electrophilic irritants. Channel activation occurs through an unusual mechanism involving covalent modification of cysteine residues clustered within an amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Here, we describe a peptidergic scorpion toxin (WaTx) that activates TRPA1 by penetrating the plasma membrane to access the same intracellular site modified by reactive electrophiles. WaTx stabilizes TRPA1 in a biophysically distinct active state characterized by prolonged channel openings and low Ca2+ permeability. Consequently, WaTx elicits acute pain and pain hypersensitivity but fails to trigger efferent release of neuropeptides and neurogenic inflammation typically produced by noxious electrophiles. These findings provide a striking example of convergent evolution whereby chemically disparate animal- and plant-derived irritants target the same key allosteric regulatory site to differentially modulate channel activity. WaTx is a unique pharmacological probe for dissecting TRPA1 function and its contribution to acute and persistent pain."
https://openalex.org/W2969552557,"Accumulating evidence suggests that constitutively active Nrf2 has a pivotal role in cancer as it induces pro-survival genes that promote cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance. The mechanisms of Nrf2 dysregulation and functions in cancer have not been fully characterized. Here, we jointly analyzed the Broad-Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics data in order to identify cancer types where Nrf2 activation is present. We found that Nrf2 is hyperactivated in a subset of glioblastoma (GBM) patients, whose tumors display a mesenchymal subtype, and uncover several different mechanisms contributing to increased Nrf2 activity. Importantly, we identified a positive feedback loop between SQSTM1/p62 and Nrf2 as a mechanism for activation of the Nrf2 pathway. We also show that autophagy and serine/threonine signaling regulates p62 mediated Keap1 degradation. Our results in glioma cell lines indicate that both Nrf2 and p62 promote proliferation, invasion and mesenchymal transition. Finally, Nrf2 activity was associated with decreased progression free survival in TCGA GBM patient samples, suggesting that treatments have limited efficacy if this transcription factor is overactivated. Overall, our findings place Nrf2 and p62 as the key components of the mesenchymal subtype network, with implications to tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. Thus, Nrf2 activation could be used as a surrogate prognostic marker in mesenchymal subtype GBMs. Furthermore, strategies aiming at either inhibiting Nrf2 or exploiting Nrf2 hyperactivity for targeted gene therapy may provide novel treatment options for this subset of GBM."

However, the mechanisms by which MuV infection impairs male fertility and Sertoli cell function remain unclear. The present study elucidated the effect of MuV infection on the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The transepithelial electrical resistance of MuV-infected mouse Sertoli cells was monitored, and the expression of major proteins of the BTB was examined. We demonstrated that MuV infection disrupted the BTB by reducing the levels of occludin and zonula occludens 1. Sertoli cells derived from Tlr2-/- and Tnfa-/- mice were analyzed for mediating MuV-induced impairment. TLR2-mediated TNF-α production by Sertoli cells in response to MuV infection impaired BTB integrity. MuV-impaired BTB was not observed in Tlr2-/- and Tnfa-/- Sertoli cells. Moreover, an inhibitor of TNF-α, pomalidomide, prevents the disruption of BTB in response to MuV infection. FITC-labeled biotin tracing assay confirmed that BTB permeability and spermatogenesis were transiently impaired by MuV infection in vivo. These findings suggest that the disruption of the BTB could be one of the mechanisms underlying MuV-impaired male fertility, in which TNF-α could play a critical role.-Wu, H., Jiang, X., Gao, Y., Liu, W., Wang, F., Gong, M., Chen, R., Yu, X., Zhang, W., Gao, B., Song, C., Han, D.

Remarkable skills such as fluent speech or virtuosic musicianship involve rapid sequences of more elementary movements or gestures, controlled with millisecond (ms) precision. Learning such rapid and precise sequences requires extensive practice and sensory feedback-dependent performance evaluation (Jabusch et al., 2009Jabusch H.C. Alpers H. Kopiez R. Vauth H.

Furthermore, practice and evaluation can be used to modify individual gestures within a previously learned sequence, ultimately generating new behaviors. How the brain enables such temporally precise learning is a mystery, but it must depend on both premotor and evaluative computations. Resolving whether the brain circuits mediating these computations are largely segregated or more distributed and possibly overlapping presents a daunting experimental challenge, especially for rapid behavioral sequences where motor learning can occur with millisecond precision, the premotor and sensory feedback signals are separated by only tens of milliseconds, and the central neurons important to behavioral learning often display both premotor and sensory properties (Hessler and Doupe, 1999Hessler N.A.

Moreover, an adult male can learn to modify the fundamental frequency (pitch) of a single syllable within this motif in response to syllable-triggered noise bursts, a process referred to as pitch learning (Tumer and Brainard, 2007Tumer E.C.

The brain of the male finch contains a well-delineated network for singing and song learning, including an anterior forebrain pathway with clear homologies to mammalian cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry (Brainard and Doupe, 2013Brainard M.S.

The output of this CBG circuit, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), plays a central role in song learning (Andalman and Fee, 2009Andalman A.S. Fee M.S.

Doupe A.J. Interruption of a basal ganglia-forebrain circuit prevents plasticity of learned vocalizations.Nature. 2000; 404: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Whether this role is evaluative or premotor or some combination of both has engendered substantial debate. The finding that LMAN neurons can respond selectively to auditory presentation of the bird’s own song, as well as the tutor song from which it was copied, raised the possibility that LMAN evaluates song performance (Solis and Doupe, 1997Solis M.M. Doupe A.J. Anterior forebrain neurons develop selectivity by an intermediate stage of birdsong learning.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6447-6462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Solis et al., 2000Solis M.M.

USA. 2000; 97: 11836-11842Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, LMAN neurons display singing-related activity that is insensitive to auditory feedback perturbation, which is suggestive of a purely premotor function (Leonardo, 2004Leonardo A. Experimental test of the birdsong error-correction model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 16935-16940Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, LMAN activity is a source of acute song variability and, following exposure to pitch-contingent noise, biases the pitch of the target syllable to escape noise playback (Andalman and Fee, 2009Andalman A.S. Fee M.S. A basal ganglia-forebrain circuit in the songbird biases motor output to avoid vocal errors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 12518-12523Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Warren et al., 2011Warren T.L. Tumer E.C. Charlesworth J.D. Brainard M.S.

Consequently, the role of LMAN may be premotor rather than evaluative, but the inactivation methods used to explore its role in pitch learning are too slow to make this distinction, and causal tests of a premotor learning role are lacking. Furthermore, if LMAN serves solely a premotor role in pitch learning, then which circuits enable performance evaluation? The songbird CBG includes projections from dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to a song-specialized BG region (area X) that is essential to juvenile song copying and adult pitch learning (Figure 1F; Hisey et al., 2018Hisey E.

Furthermore, in adult finches chronically exposed to syllable-triggered noise, the firing rates of VTA and SNc neurons that project to area X (referred to collectively as VTAX neurons) decrease on renditions that trigger noise and increase when noise is withheld, demonstrating that these neurons learn to bidirectionally encode reward prediction error (Gadagkar et al., 2016Gadagkar V.

This variation in VTAX neuron activity is causally linked to vocal learning, as pitch-contingent optogenetic excitation or inhibition of VTAX terminals is sufficient to drive syllable-specific pitch learning in adult finches (Hisey et al., 2018Hisey E.

These studies advance a model in which VTAX neurons transmit a bidirectional reinforcement signal that guides vocal learning. A crucial issue is how evaluative information reaches the VTA to compute a reinforcement signal. The songbird VTA receives major inputs from the ventral intermediate arcopallium (Aiv) and the ventral pallidum (VP) (Gale et al., 2008Gale S.D. Person A.L. Perkel D.J. A novel basal ganglia pathway forms a loop linking a vocal learning circuit with its dopaminergic input.J. Comp.

Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 840-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), providing points of entry to address this issue. Aiv receives input from auditory cortical regions, and the firing rates of VTA-projecting Aiv (AivVTA) neurons increase when the bird sings a syllable that triggers a noise burst, but do not change when noise is withheld (Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2014Mandelblat-Cerf Y. Las L. Denisenko N. Fee M.S. A role for descending auditory cortical projections in songbird vocal learning.eLife. 2014; 3: e02152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that AivVTA neurons evaluate auditory feedback to detect vocal errors and could suppress VTAX neuron activity in response to syllable-triggered noise, while also raising the question of what drives increased VTA firing on renditions when noise is withheld. The VP also receives inputs from auditory cortical regions, but unlike Aiv, it also receives direct input from area X, and thus may receive both auditory and premotor signals related to song performance. Moreover, the VP in mammals is implicated in hedonic pleasure and reward, suggesting that songbird VPVTA neurons could encode positive evaluations of song performance (Richard et al., 2016Richard J.M.

Ventral pallidum encodes relative reward value earlier and more robustly than nucleus accumbens.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In fact, a recent study of VP neurons reveals that a small number selectively respond to syllable renditions accompanied by normal feedback (Chen et al., 2019Chen R. Puzerey P.A. Roeser A.C. Riccelli T.E. Podury A. Maher K. Farhang A.R. Goldberg J.H. Songbird Ventral Pallidum Sends Diverse Performance Error Signals to Dopaminergic Midbrain.Neuron. 2019; 103: 266-276.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations support a model in which both AivVTA and VPVTA neurons process singing-related auditory feedback but provide different types of evaluative information that enable the VTA to compute a bidirectional reinforcement signal. Despite the appeal of this model, whether feedback-related variation in the activity of either of these projections is necessary for vocal learning remains untested, and whether pitch-contingent variation in AivVTA and VPVTA activity can drive either similar or opposing effects on learning remains unknown. Here, we combined closed-loop behavioral and optogenetic manipulations to distinguish evaluative from premotor circuits important to pitch learning. Then we used functional, anatomical, and molecular methods to determine how evaluative circuits bidirectionally modulate VTA activity to enable temporally precise learning. We used online syllable detection methods to deliver a brief (50 ms) burst of white noise (WN) contingent upon rendition-to-rendition changes in the frequency (pitch) of a target syllable (Figure 1B) (Tumer and Brainard, 2007Tumer E.C. Brainard M.S. Performance variability enables adaptive plasticity of ‘crystallized’ adult birdsong.Nature. 2007; 450: 1240-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Delivering WN on low pitch syllable renditions over the course of 1 day drove birds to significantly increase the pitch of the targeted syllable (Figures 1C and 1D; n = 14 syllables, n = 14 birds, p = 0.00017, paired t test). Confirming that this method is sufficient to drive syllable-specific pitch learning provided us with a means for systematically probing the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie such temporally precise learning. We reasoned that if AivVTA and VPVTA neurons play a role in evaluating song performance, then imposing stereotyped patterns of activity on their synapses in the VTA should interfere with their ability to encode differences in performance quality across syllable renditions and thus impair pitch learning. Moreover, this “interference” with pitch learning should be restricted in time to when auditory feedback is being evaluated, rather than earlier (premotor) time windows before syllable onset. To test this idea, we optogenetically interfered with AivVTA terminal activity either during the auditory feedback or premotor window of a syllable targeted for learning via pitch-contingent noise (Figures 2A–2D). We injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing a Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) gene and a fluorescent reporter (AAV2/1.CAG-ChR2.mCherry, n = 4, or AAV2/9.CAG-NRXN.ChR2.YFP, n = 1) bilaterally into the Aiv of young adult male zebra finches, waited to achieve functional ChR2 expression in AivVTA terminals, and implanted optical fibers bilaterally over the VTA and SNc (referred throughout simply as the VTA) (Figure 2E; n = 5 animals, mean age at viral injection: 121.6 ± 24.0 days post hatch (dph), mean interval between viral injections in Aiv and fiber implantation in VTA: 131.2 ± 22.1 days, mean age at implantation: 252.8 ± 15.2 dph). We then applied pitch-contingent noise to a target syllable in the motif of the bird to establish control learning values for each bird (Figures 2F and 2G). After allowing the pitch of the target syllable to recover to baseline, we again exposed the bird to pitch-contingent noise while optogenetically stimulating AivVTA terminals on all of the renditions of the target syllable (see Method Details for absolute hit rates; laser wavelength = 473 nm, power = 5–15 mW). The optogenetic stimulation of AivVTA terminals was precisely timed to target the time window when auditory feedback related to that syllable is processed in the brain (mean onset of stimulation was ∼10 ms after the mean noise onset and extended for the duration of the noise burst [50 ms]; see Method Details for a discussion of auditory latencies in the brain of the songbird). Pairing syllable-triggered noise with AivVTA terminal stimulation strongly reduced the amount of noise-evoked pitch learning, such that pitch distributions measured after 1 day of pairing noise and optogenetic stimulation were not significantly different from baseline values (Figures 2F and 2G; n = 5 syllables, n = 5 birds, p = 0.0146, paired t test feedback laser + noise versus noise alone; p = 0.2374 feedback laser + noise versus baseline). In contrast, normal levels of pitch learning occurred when the timing of AivVTA terminal stimulation was shifted earlier in time, to a 50-ms window just before syllable onset, when premotor signals for a given syllable are detectable within various forebrain song nuclei (Figures 2F and 2G; n = 5 syllables, n = 5 birds, p = 0.7211, paired t test premotor laser + noise versus noise alone; p = 0.0235 premotor laser + noise versus baseline; see Method Details for a discussion of vocal premotor latencies in singing birds). Moreover, AivVTA terminal stimulation in ChR2-expressing birds during either the premotor or evaluative window exerted no acute effects on the spectral features of the target syllable (Figure S1). Therefore, optogenetically stimulating AivVTA terminals on all of the renditions of a target syllable interferes with noise-evoked pitch learning, but only if this interference occurs during evaluative rather than premotor time windows associated with the target syllable. We used a similar approach to determine whether variation in VPVTA terminal activity encodes evaluative information important to pitch learning (Figure 2H; n = 4 animals injected bilaterally in VP with AAV2/1.CAG-ChR2.mCherry, mean age at injection: 103.5 ± 27.3 days, mean age at fiber implantation: 435.3 ± 25.1 dph). After establishing control pitch learning values (Figures 2I and 2J), we exposed the bird to pitch-contingent noise while optogenetically stimulating VPVTA terminals on all of the detected renditions of the target syllable during the auditory feedback or premotor window related to that syllable (see Method Details). Pairing pitch-contingent noise with syllable-triggered VPVTA terminal stimulation during the auditory feedback window strongly reduced the amount of pitch learning, and pitch values measured after 1 day of such pairing did not differ from baseline values (Figures 2I and 2J; n = 4 syllables, n = 4 birds, p = 0.0329, paired t test feedback laser + noise versus noise alone; p = 0.4812 feedback laser + noise versus baseline). In contrast, normal pitch learning occurred when VPVTA terminal stimulation was applied during the premotor window (Figures 2I and 2J; n = 4 syllables, n = 4 birds, p = 0.9041, paired t test premotor laser + noise versus noise alone; p = 0.0077 premotor laser + noise versus baseline). Therefore, optogenetically stimulating VPVTA terminals on all target syllable renditions interferes with noise-evoked pitch learning, but only when stimulation occurs during the auditory feedback window rather than the premotor window associated with the target syllable. Finally, VPVTA terminal stimulation in ChR2-expressing birds exerted no acute effects on the spectral features of the target syllable (Figure S2). These findings support the idea that AivVTA and VPVTA neurons encode a feedback-dependent evaluation of song performance and transmit this evaluation to the VTA to drive syllable-specific learning. A remaining issue is whether other parts of the song system also contribute to performance evaluation, or instead serve solely as premotor components that are guided by the outcome of this evaluation. In songbirds, LMAN is the sole cortical output of the CBG loop, extending axons to the song motor nucleus robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and axon collateral projections into area X (Figure 3A; Nixdorf-Bergweiler et al., 1995Nixdorf-Bergweiler B.E.

Electrophysiological and morphological evidence for a new projection of LMAN-neurones towards area X.Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Vates and Nottebohm, 1995Vates G.E. Nottebohm F. Feedback circuitry within a song-learning pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5139-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These divergent anatomical projections along with the mixed sensorimotor properties of LMAN neurons have made a causal distinction between the role of LMAN in performance and its role in evaluation difficult. To make this distinction, we injected AAV2/1.CAG-ChR2.mCherry bilaterally in LMAN of young adult male zebra finches and implanted optical fibers bilaterally over LMAN (Figures 3A–3D; n = 5 animals; mean age at injection: 86 ± 31.3 days; mean age at implantation: 181.4 ± 42.9 dph). Single unit extracellular recordings in anesthetized birds revealed that the optogenetic stimulation of LMAN neurons drove highly reliable high-frequency (>400 Hz) action potential bursts, similar to firing rates recorded in singing birds (Figures 3D and 3E; Kao et al., 2005Kao M.H. Doupe A.J. Brainard M.S. Contributions of an avian basal ganglia-forebrain circuit to real-time modulation of song.Nature. 2005; 433: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). After establishing control noise-evoked pitch-learning values, we exposed the bird to pitch-contingent noise while optogenetically stimulating LMAN cells on all of the detected renditions of the target syllable during the auditory feedback or premotor window associated with that syllable. Pitch learning proceeded normally when optogenetic stimulation was applied in the auditory feedback window; in contrast, there was no learning when stimulation was applied during the premotor window (Figures 3F and 3G; no laser versus premotor laser p = 0.0276, paired t test; no laser versus feedback laser, p = 0.9366, paired t test). We noted a slight reduction in the coefficient of variability in syllable pitch on stimulated trials, which is consistent with the premotor role of LMAN in sculpting motor output (Figure S3). In summary, optogenetically stimulating LMAN neurons on all of the renditions of a target syllable reduced noise-evoked pitch learning, but only if this interference occurred during premotor rather than auditory feedback time windows associated with the target syllable. Therefore, the role of LMAN in pitch learning is premotor and not evaluative, in direct contrast to the evaluative roles played by AivVTA and VPVTA neurons. We reasoned that if Aiv provides evaluative signals to the VTA necessary to pitch learning, then artificially elevating AivVTA terminal activity in a pitch-dependent manner should drive pitch learning in the absence of noise. To test this idea, we injected AAV2/1.CAG-ChR2.mCherry bilaterally into the Aiv of young adult male zebra finches and implanted optical fibers bilaterally over the VTA (Figures 4A, 4B, S5A and S5C; n = 4 birds, mean age at injection = 77 ± 7.4 dph, mean age at implantation: 205.3 ± 9.5 dph). Following recovery from fiber implantation (mean = 17.5 ± 4.1 days), we optogenetically stimulated AivVTA terminals when the target syllable pitch fell above (or below) a specified threshold (Figure 4C; pulse duration, 50 ms; pulse wavelength, λ = 473 nm; threshold was set to deliver stimulation to either the upper [n = 4 syllables] or lower [n = 2 syllables] ∼65% of the pitch distribution of the syllable, measured during baseline recordings). Pitch-contingent stimulation of Aiv terminals applied over several days was sufficient to drive significant changes in the pitch of the targeted syllable, as measured on unstimulated “catch” renditions (Figures 4C–4G and S6A; n = 6 syllables, n = 4 birds; p = 0.000032, paired t test). Similar to pitch learning induced by noise, the pitch of the target syllable shifted away from the frequency region receiving optogenetic stimulation, and the change in pitch was temporally restricted to the target syllable (Figures 4D–4F, S6C, and S6E; n = 6 syllables from n = 4 birds; n = 4 syllables before target p = 0.7592, one-sample t test; n = 13 syllables after targe"
https://openalex.org/W2969732675,"Assembly of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) begins at a bacteriophage-like portal complex that nucleates formation of an icosahedral capsid with capsid-associated tegument complexes (CATCs) and facilitates translocation of an ∼150-kb dsDNA genome, followed by acquisition of a pleomorphic tegument and envelope. Because of deviation from icosahedral symmetry, KSHV portal and tegument structures have largely been obscured in previous studies. Using symmetry-relaxed cryo-EM, we determined the in situ structure of the KSHV portal and its interactions with surrounding capsid proteins, CATCs, and the terminal end of KSHV's dsDNA genome. Our atomic models of the portal and capsid/CATC, together with visualization of CATCs' variable occupancy and alternate orientation of CATC-interacting vertex triplexes, suggest a mechanism whereby the portal orchestrates procapsid formation and asymmetric long-range determination of CATC attachment during DNA packaging prior to pleomorphic tegumentation/envelopment. Structure-based mutageneses confirm that a triplex deep binding groove for CATCs is a hotspot that holds promise for antiviral development."
https://openalex.org/W2970080925,"Several lifetime distributions have played an important role to fit survival data. However, for some of these models, the computation of maximum likelihood estimators is quite difficult due to presence of flat regions in the search space, among other factors. Several well-known derivative-based optimization tools are unsuitable for obtaining such estimates. To circumvent this problem, we introduce the AdequacyModel computational library version 2.0.0 for the R statistical environment with two major contributions: a general optimization technique based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method (with a minor modification of the original algorithm) and a set of statistical measures for assessment of the adequacy of the fitted model. This library is very useful for researchers in probability and statistics and has been cited in various papers in these areas. It serves as the basis for the Newdistns library (version 2.1) published in an impact journal in the area of computational statistics, see https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Newdistns. It is also the basis of the Wrapped library (version 2.0), see https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Wrapped. A third package making use of the AdequacyModel library can be found in https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sglg. In addition, the proposed library has proved to be very useful for maximizing log-likelihood functions with complex search regions. The library provides a greater control of the optimization process by introducing a stop criterion based on a minimum number of iterations and the variance of a given proportion of optimal values. We emphasize that the new library can be used not only in statistics but in physics and mathematics as proved in several examples throughout the paper."
https://openalex.org/W2970837826,"To assess awareness of cytomegalovirus (CMV); attitudes towards screening; and frequency of behaviors that could increase the risk of prenatal infection.We conducted a survey among 726 women at the 2017 Minnesota State Fair. Minnesota residents aged 18-44 were eligible if they had never been pregnant or had been pregnant within the past 10 years. We compared responses between never-pregnant and recently-pregnant women.Only 20% of study participants had previously heard of CMV. Remarkably, recently-pregnant women were no more likely to be aware of CMV than never-pregnant women after adjusting for potential confounders. After receiving information about CMV, nearly all participants indicated they believed prenatal (96%) or newborn (96%) screening should be offered.Although baseline awareness of CMV was low (even among recently-pregnant women), after learning more about the risks, women supported screening. Several states have passed or proposed legislation promoting CMV education and/or screening programs. We identified important gaps in knowledge about CMV among women who may benefit from education about how to reduce their risk of exposure and who may need to decide whether they would be willing to screen for CMV in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2971066263,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a well-recognized hepatic manifestation of metabolic disease in adults and has been associated with the development of gestational diabetes (GDM). Hepatic insulin resistance can result in increased release of glucose (from gluconeogenesis) and free fatty acids (due to enhanced lipolysis), which can lead in turn to fetal overgrowth. However, the relationship between maternal metabolic factors (such as circulating levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids [FFA], or adipokines) and excessive fetal birthweight in NAFLD has not been carefully examined. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and the subsequent risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birthweight.Singleton nondiabetic pregnant women were evaluated for the presence of fatty liver at 10-14 weeks of gestation by abdominal ultrasound. The degree of fatty liver was classified as Grade 0-3 steatosis. At the time of liver ultrasound, maternal blood was taken after fasting and measured for adiponectin and FFA. LGA was defined as birthweight >90th percentile for gestational age.A total of 623 women were included in the analysis. The frequency of LGA was 10.9% (68/623), and the frequency of NAFLD was 18.9%. The risk of LGA increased significantly in patients with Grade 2-3 steatosis in the first trimester. The relationship between Grade 2-3 steatosis and LGA remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM, and maternal serum triglyceride levels. The concentration of maternal blood adiponectin at 10-14 weeks was significantly lower in cases with LGA than non-LGA, but the maternal blood FFA concentrations were not different between the groups.The presence of Grade 2-3 steatosis on ultrasound in early pregnancy was associated with the increased risk of delivering an LGA infant, even after adjustment for multiple confounding factors including GDM. Adiponectin may be the linking biomarker between NAFLD and LGA."

For the hardest-to-reach facilities in Zambia, we compared the cost of placing point of care (POC) viral load instruments at or near facilities to the cost of an expanded sample transportation network (STN) to deliver samples to centralized laboratories.We extended a previously described geospatial model for Zambia that first optimized a STN for centralized laboratories for 90% of estimated viral load volumes. Amongst the remaining 10% of volumes, facilities were identified as candidates for POC placement, and then instrument placement was optimized such that access and instrument utilization is maximized. We evaluated the full cost per test under three scenarios: 1) POC placement at all facilities identified for POC; 2)an optimized combination of both on-site POC placement and placement at facilities acting as POC hubs; and 3) integration into the centralized STN to allow use of centralized laboratories.For the hardest-to-reach facilities, optimal POC placement covered a quarter of HIV-treating facilities. Scenario 2 resulted in a cost per test of $39.58, 6% less than the cost per test of scenario 1, $41.81. This is due to increased POC instrument utilization in scenario 2 where facilities can act as POC hubs. Scenario 3 was the most costly at $53.40 per test, due to high transport costs under the centralized model ($36 per test compared to $12 per test in scenario 2).POC VL testing may reduce the costs of expanding access to the hardest-to-reach populations, despite the cost of equipment and low patient volumes. An optimal combination of both on-site placement and the use of POC hubs can reduce the cost per test by 6-35% by reducing transport costs and increasing instrument utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2970107653,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis and is an attractive therapeutic target for combating obesity and related diseases. Human BAT activity has been evaluated by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18FDG-PET/CT) under acute cold exposure, but the method has some serious limitations, including radiation exposure. Infrared thermography (IRT) may be a simple and less-invasive alternative to evaluate BAT activity. In the present study, to establish an optimal condition for IRT, using a thermal imaging camera, skin temperature was measured in the supraclavicular region close to BAT depots (Tscv) and the control chest region (Tc) in 24 young healthy volunteers. Their BAT activity was assessed as the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) by 18FDG-PET/CT. Under a warm condition at 24–27°C, no significant correlation was found between the IRT parameters (Tscv, Tc,, and the difference between Tscv and Tc,, Δtemp) and SUVmax, but 30–120 min after cold exposure at 19°C, Tscv and Δtemp were significantly correlated with SUVmax (r = 0.40–0.48 and r = 0.68–0.76). Δtemp after cold exposure was not affected by mean body temperature, body fatness, and skin blood flow. A lower correlation (r = 0.43) of Δtemp with SUVmax was also obtained when the participant’s hands were immersed in water at 18°C for 5 min. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that Δtemp after 30–60 min cold exposure can be used as an index for BAT evaluation with 74% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and 79% diagnostic accuracy. Thus, IRT may be useful as a simple and less-invasive method for evaluating BAT, particularly for large-scale screening and longitudinal repeat studies."
https://openalex.org/W2970948834,"Vegetation is a key determinant of wildfire behaviour at field scales as it functions as fuel. Past studies in the laboratory show that plant flammability, the ability of plants to ignite and maintain combustion, is a function of their traits. However, the way the traits of individual plants combine in a vegetation community to affect field flammability has received little attention. This study aims to bridge the gap between the laboratory and field by linking plant traits to metrics of field-scale flammability. Across three prescribed burns, in Eucalyptus-dominated damp and dry forest, we measured pre-burn plant species abundance and post-burn field flammability metrics (percentage area burnt, char and scorch height). For understory species with dominant cover-abundance, we measured nine traits that had been demonstrated to influence flammability in the laboratory. We used fourth-corner ordination to evaluate covariation between the plant traits, species abundance and flammability. We found that several traits covaried at the species level. In some instances, these traits (e.g. specific leaf area and bulk density) could have cumulative effects on the flammability of a species while in other instances (e.g. moisture and specific leaf area) they may have counteractive effects, assuming trait effects on flammability are akin to previous research. At field scales, species with similar traits tended to co-occur, suggesting that the effects of individual traits accumulate within a plant community. Fourth-corner analyses found the trait-field flammability relationship to be statistically significant. Traits significantly associated with increasing field flammability metrics were: bulk density (negatively associated) and hydrocarbon quantity, specific leaf area and surface area to volume ratio (all positively associated). Our study demonstrates that some traits known to influence flammability in the laboratory can be associated with field-scale flammability metrics. Further research is needed to isolate the contributions of individual traits to understand how species composition drives forest flammability."

This study aimed to externally validate three international prediction models using JNTDB data: Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH), and International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT). We also aimed to validate the applicability of these models in the Japanese population. Of 1,091 patients registered in the JNTDB from July 2009 to June 2011, we analyzed data for 635 patients. We examined factors associated with mortality in-hospital and unfavorable outcomes 6 months after TBI by applying the TRISS, CRASH, and IMPACT models. We also conducted an external validation of these models based on these data. The patients' mean age was 60.1 ±21.1 years, and 342 were alive at the time of discharge (53.9%). Univariate analysis revealed eight major risk factors for mortality in-hospital: age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, mydriasis, acute epidural hematoma (AEDH), and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. A similar analysis identified five risk factors for unfavorable outcomes at 6 months: age, GCS, ISS, mydriasis, and AEDH. For mortality in-hospital, the TRISS had a satisfactory area under the curve value (0.75). For unfavorable outcomes at 6 months, the CRASH (basic and computed tomography) and IMPACT (core and core extended) models had satisfactory area under the curve values (0.86, 0.86, 0.81, and 0.85, respectively). The TRISS, CRASH, and IMPACT models were suitable for application to the JNTDB population, indicating these models had high value in Japanese patients with neurotrauma."
https://openalex.org/W2969523710,"The human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) contains a complex disulfide bond (Dsb) catalytic machinery. This machinery encompasses multiple Dsb thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that mediate oxidative protein folding and a less-characterized suppressor of copper sensitivity (scs) gene cluster, associated with increased tolerance to copper. To better understand the function of the Salmonella Scs system, here we characterized two of its key components, the membrane protein ScsB and the periplasmic protein ScsC. Our results revealed that these two proteins form a redox pair in which the electron transfer from the periplasmic domain of ScsB (n-ScsB) to ScsC is thermodynamically driven. We also demonstrate that the Scs reducing pathway remains separate from the Dsb oxidizing pathways and thereby avoids futile redox cycles. Additionally, we provide new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying Scs-mediated copper tolerance in Salmonella. We show that both ScsB and ScsC can bind toxic copper(I) with femtomolar affinities and transfer it to the periplasmic copper metallochaperone CueP. Our results indicate that the Salmonella Scs machinery has evolved a dual mode of action, capable of transferring reducing power to the oxidizing periplasm and protecting against copper stress by cooperating with the cue regulon, a major copper resistance mechanism in Salmonella. Overall, these findings expand our understanding of the functional diversity of Dsb-like systems, ranging from those mediating oxidative folding of proteins required for infection to those contributing to defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and copper toxicity, critical traits for niche adaptation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2970489283,"Inflammation plays an important role in atherosclerosis and its complications. Since a dysregulated inflammatory response is associated with early neurological deterioration (END), serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could be a marker of END as well.In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the serum NLR and END in patients with ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA).We evaluated consecutive patients with ischemic stroke due to LAA between January 2010 and December 2015. END was defined as an increase ≥ 2 on the total NIHSS score or ≥ 1 on the motor NIHSS score within the first 72 hours of admission. The NLR was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count.Of the 349 included patients, 18.1% (n = 63) had END events. In multivariate analysis, serum NLR was independently associated with END (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [1.00-1.16], P = 0.043). Time to admission, and in-situ thrombosis and artery-to-artery embolization mechanisms were also significantly associated with END events. In an analysis of the relationship between serum NLR and vascular lesion burden, serum NLR was positively correlated with both the degree of stenotic lesions (P for trend = 0.006) and the number of vessel stenosis (P for trend = 0.038) in a dose-response manner. We also compared serum NLR by the stroke mechanisms: patients with hypoperfusion or in-situ thrombosis had the highest levels of NLR: however, only those with in-situ thrombosis had significantly higher NLR in the END group compared to the non-END group (P = 0.005).Serum NLR levels were associated with END events in patients with ischemic stroke due to LAA. Since NLR was also closely correlated with the underlying vascular lesions, our results indicated clues for mechanisms of END events."
https://openalex.org/W2969966279,"Genomic amplification of the oncogene MYCN is a major driver in the development of high-risk neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer with poor prognosis. Given the challenge in targeting MYCN directly for therapy, we sought to identify MYCN-dependent metabolic vulnerabilities that can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we report that the gene encoding glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in glycine breakdown with the production of the one-carbon unit 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN. As a result, GLDC expression is markedly elevated in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines. This transcriptional upregulation of GLDC expression is of functional significance, as GLDC depletion by RNA interference inhibits the proliferation and tumorigenicity of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines by inducing G1 arrest. Metabolomic profiling reveals that GLDC knockdown disrupts purine and central carbon metabolism and reduces citrate production, leading to a decrease in the steady-state levels of cholesterol and fatty acids. Moreover, blocking purine or cholesterol synthesis recapitulates the growth-inhibitory effect of GLDC knockdown. These findings reveal a critical role of GLDC in sustaining the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells with high-level GLDC expression and suggest that MYCN amplification is a biomarker for GLDC-based therapeutic strategies against high-risk neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2969571672,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft-tissue sarcomas that frequently arise in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most of these tumors are unresectable at diagnosis and minimally responsive to conventional treatment, lending urgency to the identification of new pathway dependencies and drugs with potent antitumor activities. We therefore examined a series of candidate agents for their ability to induce apoptosis in MPNST cells arising in nf1/tp53-deficient zebrafish. In this study, we found that DNA topoisomerase I-targeted drugs and mTOR kinase inhibitors were the most effective single agents in eliminating MPNST cells without prohibitive toxicity. In addition, three members of these classes of drugs, either AZD2014 or INK128 in combination with irinotecan, acted synergistically to induce apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. In mechanistic studies, irinotecan not only induces apoptosis by eliciting a DNA damage response, but also acts synergistically with AZD2014 to potentiate the hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1, a downstream target of mTORC1. Profound hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by this drug combination causes an arrest of protein synthesis, which potently induces tumor cell apoptosis. Our findings provide a compelling rationale for further in vivo evaluation of the combination of DNA topoisomerase I-targeted drugs and mTOR kinase inhibitors against these aggressive nerve sheath tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2969957392,"The nuclear export receptor CRM1 is an important regulator involved in the shuttling of various cellular and viral RNAs between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. HIV-1 Rev interacts with CRM1 in the late phase of HIV-1 replication to promote nuclear export of unspliced and single spliced HIV-1 transcripts. However, other cellular factors involved in the CRM1-dependent viral RNA nuclear export remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ANP32A and ANP32B mediate the export of unspliced or partially spliced viral mRNA via interactions with Rev and CRM1. We found that a double, but not single, knockout of ANP32A and ANP32B significantly decreased the expression of gag protein. Reconstitution of either ANP32A or ANP32B restored the viral production equally. Disruption of both ANP32A and ANP32B expression led to a dramatic accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA in the nucleus. We further identified that ANP32A and ANP32B interact with both Rev and CRM1 to promote RNA transport. Our data strongly suggest that ANP32A and ANP32B play an important role in the Rev–CRM1 pathway, which is essential for HIV-1 replication, and our findings provide a candidate therapeutic target for host defense against retroviral infection."

Previously, our group showed that A20 promotes tumor metastasis through multi-monoubiquitylation of SNAIL1 in basal-like breast cancer. Here, we investigated survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer according to A20 expression.We retrospectively collected tumor samples from patients with breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an A20-specific antibody was performed, and survival outcomes were analyzed.A20 expression was evaluated in 442 patients. High A20 expression was associated with advanced anatomical stage and young age. High A20 expression showed significantly inferior recurrence-free-survival and overall-survival (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that A20 was an independent prognostic marker for RFS (HRs: 2.324, 95% CIs: 1.446-3.736) and OS (HRs: 2.629, 95% CIs: 1.585-4.361). In human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes, high A20 levels were associated with poor OS.We found that A20 expression is a poor prognostic marker in breast cancer. The prognostic impact of A20 was pronounced in aggressive tumors, such as HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes. Our findings suggested that A20 may be a valuable target in patients with aggressive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2970084540,"Coronary stents for treating atherosclerosis are traditionally manufactured from metallic alloys. However, metal stents permanently reside in the body and may trigger undesirable immunological responses. Bioresorbable polymer stents can provide a temporary scaffold that resorbs once the artery heals but are mechanically inferior, requiring thicker struts for equivalent radial support, which may increase thrombosis risk. This study addresses the challenge of designing mechanically effective but sufficiently thin poly(L-lactic acid) stents through a computational approach that optimises material properties and stent geometry. Forty parametric stent designs were generated: cross-sectional area (post-dilation), foreshortening, stent-to-artery ratio and radial collapse pressure were evaluated computationally using finite element analysis. Response surface methodology was used to identify performance trade-offs by formulating relationships between design parameters and response variables. Multi-objective optimisation was used to identify suitable stent designs from approximated Pareto fronts and an optimal design is proposed that offers comparable performance to designs in clinical practice. In summary, a computational framework has been developed that has potential application in the design of high stiffness, thin strut polymeric stents."

There is no cure, and patients are predominantly managed by methionine-restricted diet (MRD) to limit the production of Hcy. In this study, we used the I278T mouse model of HCU to evaluate the long-term impact of a novel enzyme replacement therapy [truncated human CBS C15S mutant modified with linear 20-kDa N-hydroxysuccinimide ester polyethylene glycol (OT-58)] on clinical end points relevant to human patients with HCU. In addition, we compared its efficacy on a background of either MRD or normal methionine intake [regular diet (REG)] to that of MRD alone. We found that, compared with untreated I278T mice, OT-58 treatment of I278T mice fed with the REG diet resulted in a 90% decrease in plasma Hcy concentrations and correction of learning/cognition, endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis, bone mineralization, and body composition. On background of the MRD, OT-58 performed equally well with plasma Hcy entirely normalized. The MRD alone decreased plasma Hcy by 67% and corrected the HCU phenotype in I278T mice. However, the MRD increased anxiety and reduced bone mineral content in both I278T mice and wild-type controls. This study shows that OT-58 is a highly efficacious novel treatment for HCU on the background of either normal or restricted methionine intake.-Majtan, T., Park, I., Cox, A., Branchford, B.

RecQ-like helicase 1 (RECQ1), a DNA repair helicase, is critical for genome stability, and loss-of-function mutations in the RECQ1 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to breast cancer. In this study, using a CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell-based model, we show that the genetic or functional loss of RECQ1 sensitizes MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog used in chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer. RECQ1 loss led to defective ATR Ser/Thr kinase (ATR)/checkpoint kinase 1 (ChK1) activation and greater DNA damage accumulation in response to gemcitabine treatment. Dual deficiency of MUS81 structure-specific endonuclease subunit (MUS81) and RECQ1 increased gemcitabine-induced, replication-associated DNA double-stranded breaks. Consistent with defective checkpoint activation, a ChK1 inhibitor further sensitized RECQ1-deficient cells to gemcitabine and increased cell death. Our results reveal an important role for RECQ1 in controlling cell cycle checkpoint activation in response to gemcitabine-induced replication stress.

When a replication fork stalls, the uncoupling of replicative helicase from the polymerase complexes leads to the generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is coated by RPA (replication protein A) (26Cortez D.

The RPA-coated ssDNA acts as a scaffold and recruits the key kinases ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and RAD3-related) that activate the downstream effectors ChK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1) to facilitate DNA repair and cell survival (28Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. ATR-mediated checkpoint pathways regulate phosphorylation and activation of human Chk1.Mol.

Failure in this protective cascade results in the irreversible collapse of the replication fork, which can result in a DNA double-stranded break, which is the most potent form of DNA lesions (25Lambert S. Froget B. Carr A.M. Arrested replication fork processing: interplay between checkpoints and recombination.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6 (17412649): 1042-106110.1016/j.dnarep.2007.02.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these protective systems are severely challenged by exogenous sources of DNA damage, such as cancer therapeutics that block replication (29Hengel S.R. Spies M.A. Spies M.

In this study, we investigated how the genetic or functional loss of RECQ1 in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells impacts the cellular response to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as camptothecin and gemcitabine, which are known to interfere with DNA replication. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that disrupts replication by incorporating into DNA and inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in the depletion of the dNTP pool (30Plunkett W. Huang P.

SNP in RECQ1 has been associated with the overall survival of patients who received gemcitabine-based therapy (2Li D. Frazier M. Evans D.B. Hess K.R. Crane C.H. Jiao L. Abbruzzese J.L.

To understand the molecular functions of RECQ1 in DNA repair and how the mutations in this gene promote tumorigenesis, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate an isogenic pair of RECQ1 WT and RECQ1 knockout (KO) MDA-MB-231 cell lines.

We used the CRISPR-Cas9 technique to generate an isogenic pair of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines that either expressed (RECQ1-WT) or lacked (RECQ1-KO) RECQ1 expression. We designed single guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the RECQ1 gene on exon 3, cloned the gRNA into the pENTR221 gRNA cloning vector, and confirmed the correct insertion of the target sites by DNA sequencing. The efficiency of the gRNA to generate indels was validated by SURVEYOR assay. After co-transfection of the MDA-MB-231 cells by RECQ1-gRNA and the corresponding vectors, followed by puromycin selection, the isolated clones were screened for RECQ1 expression at the protein level by Western blotting analysis, using a specific antibody against RECQ1. The results confirmed the complete loss of RECQ1 protein in the RECQ1-KO cell line (Fig. 1A). The results of the Sanger sequencing revealed that in the WT clones, the RECQ1 genomic sequence at the target site was intact and the same as that of the unedited parental MDA-MB-231 control. In the KO clones, RECQ1 genomic sequences at the target site showed insertions and deletions compared with the unedited control (Fig. S1A). In the KO clones obtained, each clone had distinct genome sequences at the target site. All the genomic sequences in the KO clones contained indels that resulted in the nonfunctional gene products, which eventually led to the loss of the protein. To compare the functions of the WT RECQ1 protein with those of the RECQ1 variant in an isogenic background, we reconstituted the RECQ1-KO cell line using engineered pCB6 vectors that stably expressed either the empty vector or the full-length WT RECQ1 or RECQ1 variants with individual missense mutations (A195S, R215Q, R455C, M458K, and T562I), which were reported to increase breast cancer susceptibility.

https://openalex.org/W2971002032,"Practitioners of strength and conditioning are increasingly using vibration and unstable environments to enhance training effects. However, little evidence has been found comparing the use of suspension devices and vibratory platforms used in the Bulgarian squat. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the effect of suspension devices (TRX®), unstable surfaces (BOSU®), and vibration plates on muscle activity and force during the Bulgarian squat. Twenty physically active male students (age = 24.40 ± 3.63 years) performed a set of five repetitions of Bulgarian squats, suspended lunges, suspended lunges-BOSU, suspended lunges-Vibro30, and suspended lunges-Vibro40 (vibration 30 Hz or 40 Hz and 4 mm of amplitude). A randomized within-subject design was used to compare leg muscle activity, vertical ground reaction forces, and force exerted on the strap across the five exercises. Results showed no significant differences in muscle activity between the Bulgarian squat and suspended lunge (p = 0.109, d = 2.84). However, the suspended lunge significantly decreased muscle activation compared to the suspended lunge-BOSU (p = 0.012, d = 0.47), suspended lunge-Vibro30 (p = 0.001, d = 1.26), and suspended lunge-Vibro40 (p = 0.000, d = 1.51). Likewise, the Bulgarian squat achieved lower activity than the suspended lunge-Vibro40 (p = 0.010, d = 0.96). The force on the strap significantly decreased in the suspended lunge-BOSU compared to the suspended lunge-Vibro30 (p = 0.009, d = 0.56). The suspended lunge achieved higher front leg force production than the Bulgarian squat (p = 0.006, d = 0.48). In conclusion, leaning the rear leg on a suspension device does not provoke an increase in the activation of the front leg during the Bulgarian squat but increases the vertical ground reaction forces. Thus, the use of unstable surfaces or vibration plates for the front leg increased muscular activity when performing a suspended lunge."
https://openalex.org/W2971104168,"The Yellow Sea features unique characteristics due to strong tides and nutrient-enriched freshwater outflows from China and Korea. The coupling of archaeal and bacterial assemblages associated with environmental factors at two bay areas in the Yellow Sea was investigated. Temporal variations of the archaeal and bacterial assemblages were shown to be greater than the spatial variations based on an analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences. Distinct temporal dynamics of both planktonic archaeal and bacterial assemblages was associated with temperature, NO2-, and chlorophyll a ([chl-a]) concentrations in the bays of the Yellow Sea. The [chl-a] was the prime predictor of bacterial abundance, and some taxa were clearly correlated with [chl-a]. Bacteroidetes and Alpha-proteobacteria dominated at high [chl-a] stations while Gamma-proteobacteria (esp. SAR86 clade) and Actinobacteria (Candidatus Actinomarina clade) were abundant at low [chl-a] stations. The archaeal abundance was comparable with the bacterial abundance in most of the October samples. Co-dominance of Marine Group II (MGII) and Candidatus Nitrosopumilus suggests that the assimilation of organic nitrogen by MGII could be coupled with nitrification by ammonia-oxidizing archaea. The distinct temporal dynamics of the archaeal and bacterial assemblages might be attributable to the strong tides and the inflow of nutrient-rich freshwater."

Blood, urine, wound and sputum samples were cultured and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. We examined factors associated with resistance and compared hospital outcomes for participants with and without resistant isolates.We screened 19,178 patient-days, and enrolled 647 unique participants with suspected infection. We obtained 942 culture specimens, of which 357 were culture-positive specimens. Of these positive specimens, 155 (43.4%) were wound, 83 (23.2%) urine, 64 (17.9%) blood, and 55 (15.4%) sputum. Gram-negative bacteria comprised 323 (88.7%) of all isolates. Of 241 Gram-negative isolates tested for ceftriaxone, 183 (75.9%) were resistant. Of 92 Gram-negative isolates tested for the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive phenotype, 66 (71.7%) were ESBL positive phenotype. Transfer from another facility, recent surgery or antibiotic exposure, and hospital-acquired infection were each associated with resistance. Mortality was 19.6% for all enrolled participants.This is the first published prospective hospital-wide antibiogram of multiple specimen types from East Africa with ESBL testing. Our study suggests that low-resource settings with limited and inconsistent access to the full range of antibiotic classes may bear the highest burden of resistant infections. Hospital-acquired infections and recent antibiotic exposure are associated with a high proportion of resistant infections. Efforts to slow the development of resistance and supply effective antibiotics are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2970262822,"Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations whose formation requires caveolin-1 (Cav1), the adaptor protein polymerase I, and the transcript release factor (PTRF or CAVIN1). Caveolae have an important role in cell functioning, signaling, and disease. In the absence of CAVIN1/PTRF, Cav1 forms non-caveolar membrane domains called scaffolds. In this work, we train machine learning models to automatically distinguish between caveolae and scaffolds from single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data. We apply machine learning algorithms to discriminate biological structures from SMLM data. Our work is the first that is leveraging machine learning approaches (including deep learning models) to automatically identifying biological structures from SMLM data. In particular, we develop and compare three binary classification methods to identify whether or not a given 3D cluster of Cav1 proteins is a caveolae. The first uses a random forest classifier applied to 28 hand-crafted/designed features, the second uses a convolutional neural net (CNN) applied to a projection of the point clouds onto three planes, and the third uses a PointNet model, a recent development that can directly take point clouds as its input. We validate our methods on a dataset of super-resolution microscopy images of PC3 prostate cancer cells labeled for Cav1. Specifically, we have images from two cell populations: 10 PC3 and 10 CAVIN1/PTRF-transfected PC3 cells (PC3-PTRF cells) that form caveolae. We obtained a balanced set of 1714 different cellular structures. Our results show that both the random forest on hand-designed features and the deep learning approach achieve high accuracy in distinguishing the intrinsic features of the caveolae and non-caveolae biological structures. More specifically, both random forest and deep CNN classifiers achieve classification accuracy reaching 94% on our test set, while the PointNet model only reached 83% accuracy. We also discuss the pros and cons of the different approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2970477064,"Risk models (RM) need external validation to assess their value beyond the setting in which they were developed. We validated a RM combining mpMRI and clinical parameters for the probability of harboring significant prostate cancer (sPC, Gleason Score ≥ 3+4) for biopsy-naïve men.The original RM was based on data of 670 biopsy-naïve men from Heidelberg University Hospital who underwent mpMRI with PI-RADS scoring prior to MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsy 2012-2015. Validity was tested by a consecutive cohort of biopsy-naïve men from Heidelberg (n = 160) and externally by a cohort of 133 men from University College London Hospital (UCLH). Assessment of validity was performed at fusion-biopsy by calibration plots, receiver operating characteristics curve and decision curve analyses. The RM`s performance was compared to ERSPC-RC3, ERSPC-RC3+PI-RADSv1.0 and PI-RADSv1.0 alone.SPC was detected in 76 men (48%) at Heidelberg and 38 men (29%) at UCLH. The areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.86 for the RM in both cohorts. For ERSPC-RC3+PI-RADSv1.0 the AUC was 0.84 in Heidelberg and 0.82 at UCLH, for ERSPC-RC3 0.76 at Heidelberg and 0.77 at UCLH and for PI-RADSv1.0 0.79 in Heidelberg and 0.82 at UCLH. Calibration curves suggest that prevalence of sPC needs to be adjusted to local circumstances, as the RM overestimated the risk of harboring sPC in the UCLH cohort. After prevalence-adjustment with respect to the prevalence underlying ERSPC-RC3 to ensure a generalizable comparison, not only between the Heidelberg and die UCLH subgroup, the RM`s Net benefit was superior over the ERSPC`s and the mpMRI`s for threshold probabilities above 0.1 in both cohorts.The RM discriminated well between men with and without sPC at initial MRI-targeted biopsy but overestimated the sPC-risk at UCLH. Taking prevalence into account, the model demonstrated benefit compared with clinical risk calculators and PI-RADSv1.0 in making the decision to biopsy men at suspicion of PC. However, prevalence differences must be taken into account when using or validating the presented risk model."
https://openalex.org/W2971311195,"The impact of a rider's and saddle's mass on saddle thermal pattern distribution was evaluated using infrared thermography (IRT). Eighteen racehorses were ridden by four riders with their own saddle. Images of the saddle panels were captured at each of six thermographic examinations. On each image, six regions of interest (ROIs) were marked on the saddle panels. The mean temperature for each ROI was extracted. To evaluate the influence of load on saddle fit, 4 indicators were used: ΔTmax (difference between the mean temperature of the warmest and coolest ROI); standard deviation of the mean temperature of the six ROIs; right/left; bridging/rocking and front/back thermal pattern indicator. Incorrect saddle fit was found in 25 measurements (23.1%) with ΔTmax greater than 2°C. The relationships between rider and saddle fit as well as saddle fit and horse were significant (p<0.001). An average ΔTmax in rider A was significantly higher than in other riders (p<0.001). The right/left thermal pattern differed significantly from the optimal value for riders A and B; while the bridging/rocking thermal pattern differed significantly from this value for riders A, C and D (p<0.05). Front saddle thermal pattern was most frequent for rider A (41.5%), whereas back saddle thermal pattern was most frequent for rider C (85.7%). Measurement of the mean temperature in 6 ROIs on saddle panels after training was helpful in assessing the influence of rider and saddle mass on saddle fit. IRT offered a non-invasive, rapid and simple method for assessing load on thermal pattern distribution in race saddles."

CK19 prevention of Rab7A-mediated lysosomal degradation was a key mechanism in apical CFTR stabilization. Unexpectedly, CK19 expression was decreased by ∼40% in primary HBE cells from homogenous F508del patients with CF relative to non-CF controls.

https://openalex.org/W2970814972,"With the exponential increase in malware, homology analysis has become a hot research topic in the malware detection field. This paper proposes MHAS, a malware homology analysis system based on ensemble learning and multifeatures. MHAS generates grayscale images from malware binary files and then uses the opcode tool IDA Pro to extract opcode sequences and system call graphs. Thus, RGB images and M-images are generated on the image matrix. Then, MHAS uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as base learners to perform bagging ensemble learning to learn features from the grayscale images, RGB images and M-images. Next, MHAS integrates the nine base learners using voting, learning and selective ensemble (in that order) and maps the integration results to the result matrix. Finally, the result matrix is again integrated using the learning method to obtain the final malware classification result. To verify the accuracy of MHAS, we performed a malware family classification experiment, that included samples of 10 malware families. The results showed that MHAS can reach an accuracy rate of 99.17%, meaning that it can effectively analyze and identify malware families."
https://openalex.org/W2970395461,"The prevalence of maternal and child malnutrition in Nepal is among the highest in the world, despite substantial reductions in the last few decades. One effort to combat this problem is Suaahara II (SII), a multi-sectoral program implemented in 42 of Nepal’s 77 districts to improve dietary diversity (DD) and reduce maternal and child undernutrition. Using cross-sectional data from SII’s 2017 annual monitoring survey, this study explores associations between exposure to SII and maternal and child DD. The study sample included 3635 mothers with at least one child under the age of five. We focused on three primary SII intervention platforms: interpersonal communication (IPC) by frontline workers, community mobilization (CM) via events, and mass media through a weekly radio program (Bhanchhin Aama); and also created an exposure scale to assess the dose-response relationship. DD was measured both as a continuous score and as a binary measure of meeting the recommended minimum dietary diversity of consuming foods from at least 5 of 10 food groups for mothers and at least 4 of 7 food groups for children. We used linear and logistic regression models, controlling for potentially confounding factors at the individual and household level. We found a positive association between any exposure to SII platforms and maternal DD scores (b = 0.09; p = 0.05), child (aged 2–5 years) DD scores (b = 0.11; p = 0.03), and mothers meeting minimum dietary diversity (OR = 1.16; p = 0.05). There were significant, positive associations between both IPC and CM events and meeting minimum DD (IPC: OR = 1.31, p = 0.05; CM: OR = 1.37; p<0.001) and also between CM events and DD scores (b = 0.14; p = 0.03) among mothers. We found significant, positive associations between mass media and meeting minimum DD (OR: 1.38; p = 0.04) among children aged 6–24 months and between mass media and DD scores (b = 0.15; p = 0.01) among children aged 2–5 years. We also found that exposure to all three platforms, versus fewer platforms, had the strongest association with maternal DD scores (b = 0.45; p = 0.01), child (aged 2–5 years) DD scores (b = 0.41; p<0.001) and mothers meeting MDD (OR = 2.33; p<0.001). These findings suggest that a multi-pronged intervention package is necessary to address poor maternal and child dietary practices and that the barriers to behavior change for maternal diets may differ from those for child diets. They also highlight the importance of IPC and CM for behavior change and as a pre-requisite to mass media programs being effective, particularly for maternal diets."
https://openalex.org/W2970739467,"Atonal homolog 8 (Atoh8) is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family, which is expressed in the cartilaginous elements of endochondral bones. To analyze its function during chondrogenesis we deleted Atoh8 in mice using a chondrocyte- (Atoh8flox/flox;Col2a1-Cre) and a germline- (Atoh8flox/flox;Prx1-Crefemale) specific Cre allele. In both strains, Atoh8 deletion leads to a reduced skeletal size of the axial and appendicular bones, but the stages of phenotypic manifestations differ. While we observed obviously shortened bones in Atoh8flox/flox;Col2a1-Cre mice only postnatally, the bones of Atoh8flox/flox;Prx1-Crefemale mice are characterized by a reduced bone length already at prenatal stages. Detailed histological and molecular investigations revealed reduced zones of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes. In addition, Atoh8 deletion identified Atoh8 as a positive regulator of chondrocyte proliferation. As increased Atoh8 expression is found in the region of prehypertrophic chondrocytes where the expression of Ihh, a main regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, is induced, we investigated a potential interaction of Atoh8 function and Ihh signaling. By activating Ihh signaling with Purmorphamine we demonstrate that Atoh8 regulates chondrocyte proliferation in parallel or downstream of Ihh signaling while it acts on the onset of hypertrophy upstream of Ihh likely by modulating Ihh expression levels."
https://openalex.org/W2969892561,"This research aimed to associate for the first time in the literature Regulatory Focus and Self-Determination theories to understand the dynamics of physical activity practice in the health context.

The main results of structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that across the two studies, health promotion focus was positively associated with intrinsic motivation (.44 < β < .74, p < .001), integrated regulation (.47 < β < .72, p < .001), identified regulation (.40 < β < .69, p < .001) and introjected regulation (.41 < β < .53, p < .001), whereas health prevention focus was positively related with external regulation (.31 < β < .45, p < .001) and amotivation (.32 < β < .38, p < .001). Bootstrapping analyses main results in Study 2 showed that health promotion focus was indirectly associated with physical activity through intrinsic motivation (95% CI [.02 to .11]), integrated regulation (95% CI [.00 to .08]), identified regulation (95% CI [.00 to .09]) and introjected regulation (95% CI [.04 to .12]), whereas health prevention focus was indirectly associated with physical activity through external regulation (95% CI [.00 to .12]).

https://openalex.org/W2970500916,"In many beef and some dairy production systems, crossbreeding is used to take advantage of breed complementarity and heterosis. Admixed animals are frequently identified by their coat color and body conformation phenotypes, however, without pedigree information it is not possible to identify the expected breed composition of an admixed animal and in the presence of selection, the actual composition may differ from expectation. As the roles of DNA and genotype data become more pervasive in animal agriculture, a systematic method for estimating the breed composition (the proportions of an animal’s genome originating from ancestral pure breeds) has utility for a variety of downstream analyses including the estimation of genomic breeding values for crossbred animals, the estimation of quantitative trait locus effects, and heterosis and heterosis retention in advanced generation composite animals. Currently, there is no automated or semi-automated ancestry estimation platform for cattle and the objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of extant public software for ancestry estimation and determine the effects of reference population size and composition and number of utilized single nucleotide polymorphism loci on ancestry estimation. We also sought to develop an analysis pipeline that would simplify this process for members of the livestock genomics research community. We developed and tested a tool, “CRUMBLER”, to estimate the global ancestry of cattle using ADMIXTURE and SNPweights based on a defined reference panel. CRUMBLER, was developed and evaluated in cattle, but is a species agnostic pipeline that facilitates the streamlined estimation of breed composition for individuals with potentially complex ancestries using publicly available global ancestry software and a specified reference population SNP dataset. We developed the reference panel from a large cattle genotype data set and breed association pedigree information using iterative analyses to identify purebred individuals that were representative of each breed. We also evaluated the numbers of markers necessary for breed composition estimation and simulated genotypes for advanced generation composite animals to evaluate the precision of the developed tool. The developed CRUMBLER pipeline extracts a specified subset of genotypes that is common to all current commercially available genotyping platforms, processes these into the file formats required for the analysis software, and predicts admixture proportions using the specified reference population allele frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2970621831,"Worldwide, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. Ukraine is one of 30 countries with the highest burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Global literature shows that social support (SS) is important in improving TB treatment adherence, reducing lost to follow up rates and improving treatment outcomes. There are several models of SS available, and the literature provides little information on what aspects of SS are most important to TB patients in improving their adherence.We used qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews (IDI) with 21 TB patients and 15 SS providers and coordinators in Ukraine in August-September 2016 to understand how the SS program promoted treatment adherence among patients. We examined the aspects of outpatient TB treatment that made adherence particularly difficult for patients in at-risk groups and aspects of the SS programs that worked best for addressing those barriers. Interviews were transcribed and analysis was performed to derive emergent themes.Main barriers included side effects from medicine, the amount of time required daily for transportation and waiting in lines at the health facility, transportation expenses, risks of being identified when visiting a TB facility and lack of motivation to seek treatment. Features of the SS program most valued by patients were convenience of not having to visit facility and support provided by nurses. These two features directly addressed most of the barriers identified. The commitment and qualities of the nurses that provided the SS was an important element of the program.This qualitative study suggests that the SS program in Ukraine was successful in reducing treatment default among patients at high risk of default because it directly addressed most of the major barriers they faced to treatment adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2970080790,"Children and young people with neuromuscular disorders (NMD), such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), develop progressive respiratory muscles weakness and pulmonary restriction. Pulmonary function monitoring of the decline in lung function allows for timely intervention with cough assist techniques and nocturnal non-invasive ventilation (NIV). NMD may find the measurement of lung function difficult using current techniques. Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) has been proposed as a novel, non-contact, self-calibrating, non-invasive method of assessing lung function. The overarching aim of this study was to investigate the use of SLP as a novel method for monitoring respiratory function in children with neuromuscular disease.SLP thoraco-abdominal (TA) displacement was correlated with forced vital capacity measurements recorded by spirometry and the repeatability of the measurements with both methods examined. SLP tidal breathing parameters were investigated to assess the range and repeatability of regional right and left side TA displacement and rib cage and abdominal wall displacement.The comparison of the FVC measured with SLP and with spirometry, while having good correlation (R = 0.78) had poor measurement agreement (95% limits of agreement: -1.2 to 1.2L) The mean relative contribution of right and left TA displacement in healthy controls was 50:50 with a narrow range. Repeatability of this measure with SLP was found to be good in healthy controls and moderate in NMD children with/without scoliosis but with a wider range. The majority of the control group displayed a predominant rib cage displacement during tidal breathing and those who displayed predominant abdominal wall displacement showed displacement of both regions close to 50:50 with similar results for the rib cage and abdomen. In comparison, children with NMD have a more variable contribution for all of these parameters. In addition, SLP was able to detect a reduction in abdominal contribution to TA displacement with age in the DMD group and detect paradoxical breathing in children with NMD. Using SLP tracings during tidal breathing we were able to identify three specific patterns of breathing amongst healthy individuals and in children with NMD.SLP is a novel method for measuring lung function that requires limited patient cooperation and may be especially useful in children with neuromuscular disorders. Measuring the relative contributions of the right and left chest wall and chest versus abdominal movements allows a more detailed assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2970094016,"Objectives Changes in treatment choice of therapy and size of treated population that can lead to under- or overestimate of payer’s budget are less likely to be reassured after reimbursement adoption of a new drug. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of febuxostat introduction and the modifications in its insurance coverage on the utilization and expenditure of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). Methods Electronic medical records for adults patients prescribed any ULT during 2010–2015 was derived from the largest medical organization in Taiwan. Aggregated estimates of ULT use and costs were assessed per 3-month and per patient per month (PPPM). Factors associated with total ULT expenditure were assessed using a time series design with factored Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Results ULT prevalent users increased 34.1% from 2010 to 2015 and a 123% increase in total ULT expenditure. Numbers on allopurinol and sulfinpyrazone both declined 31%, and on benzbromarone and febuxostat gradually increased to 38.21% and 22.89% of all users in 2015. Insurance payments PPPM ($4.44 to $9.22) and total monthly ULT cost ($32,946 to $ 85,732) growth more than doubled in 6 years, trend changes generated mostly by individuals switching to febuxostat. Conclusions ULT use moved to favor benzbromarone and febuxostat; greater expensive uptake for febuxostat led to a rapid rise in ULT cost. Marginal values of increasing access to febuxostat for asymptomatic hyperuricemia should be focus on future studies to facilitate drug prices negotiation and ensure appropriate ULT use."
https://openalex.org/W2970440727,"Background Hepatocelluar cancer (HCC) is the leading cause of death among people with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis. Our aim was to determine the optimal surveillance frequency for patients with HCV-related compensated cirrhosis. Methods We developed a decision analytic Markov model and validated it against data from the Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated with Liver Disease (VOCAL) study group and published epidemiologic studies. Four strategies of different surveillance intervals were compared: no surveillance and ultrasound surveillance every 12, 6, and 3 months. We estimated lifetime survival, life expectancy, quality adjusted life years (QALY), total costs associated with each strategy, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. We applied a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000. Analysis was conducted for two scenarios: a scenario reflecting current HCV and HCC surveillance compliance rates and treatment use and an aspirational scenario. Results In the current scenario the preferred strategy was 3-month surveillance with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $7,159/QALY. In the aspirational scenario, 6-month surveillance was preferred with an ICER of $82,807/QALY because treating more people with HCV led to a lower incidence of HCC. Sensitivity analyses suggested that surveillance every 12 months would suffice in the particular circumstance when patients are very likely to return regularly for testing and when appropriate HCV and HCC treatment is readily available. Compared with the current scenario, the aspirational scenario resulted in a 1.87 year gain in life expectancy for the cohort because of large reductions in decompensated cirrhosis and HCC incidence. Conclusions HCC surveillance has good value for money for patients with HCV-related compensated cirrhosis. Investments to improve adherence to surveillance should be made when rates are suboptimal. Surveillance every 12 months will suffice when patients are very likely to return regularly for testing and when appropriate HCV and HCC treatment is readily available."
https://openalex.org/W2971047588,"Cesky Fousek is considered to be one of the oldest pointing dog breeds in Europe and has been appreciated for its versatile working skills. Because it faced extinction in the past, the Cesky Fousek was restored from German Wirehaired and Shorthaired Pointers. Additionally, the breed was recently used in the USA with the initial intent of improvement of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon (synonymous with Korthals Griffon) by the Bohemian Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Club of America. This study evaluates genetic diversity parameters of Cesky Fousek and compares them to the other continental pointing dogs that played a role in the formation of its gene pool. DNA from buccal swab and blood samples (n = 405) were analyzed using 18 microsatellite markers. Parameters of genetic polymorphism show that the Cesky Fousek breed has a comparable rate of variation as other hunting breeds despite the low population size and severe historical bottlenecks. Clustering analyses reveal a unique genetic status as a distinct pointing dog breed and the relatedness of the breeds is in good concordance with historical data. The present study demonstrates that despite historical admixture among lineages, separate pointing breeds constitute genetically differentiated units, mirroring unique breeding stocks and pedigree isolation among specific breed clubs, reflecting differences in breeding programs under each association."
https://openalex.org/W2970415348,"The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) has risen 35% since 2012 and over two-thirds of Americans exhibit features characterizing this condition (obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and/or endothelial dysfunction). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a novel dietary supplemental organic mineral complex (OMC) on these risk factors in a rodent model of MetSyn. Six-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either standard chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) composed of 60% kcal from fat for 10 weeks. Rats were also treated with OMC in their drinking water at either 0 mg/mL (control), 0.6 mg/mL, or 3.0 mg/mL. The HFD-treated rats exhibited significantly increased body mass (p<0.05), epididymal fat pad mass (p<0.001), waist circumference (p = 0.010), in addition to elevations in plasma endotoxins (p<0.001), ALT activity (p<0.001), fasting serum glucose (p = 0.025) and insulin concentrations (p = 0.009). OMC did not affect body weight or adiposity induced by the HFD. At the higher dose OMC significantly blunted HFD-induced hyperglycemia (p = 0.021), whereas both low and high doses of OMC prevented HFD-induced endotoxemia (p = 0.002 and <0.001, respectively) and hepatocyte injury (ALT activity, p<0.01). Despite evidence of oxidative stress (elevated urinary H2O2 p = 0.032) in HFD-fed rats, OMC exhibited no demonstrable antioxidative effect. Consistent with prior studies, mesenteric arteries from HFD rats had more uncoupled eNOS (p = 0.006) and iNOS protein expression (p = 0.027) in addition to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation that was abrogated by the high dose of OMC (p<0.05). This effect of OMC may be attributed to the high nitrate content of the supplement. These findings suggest that the OMC supplement, particularly at the higher dose, ameliorated several risk factors associated with MetSyn via a non-antioxidant-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2970927494,"To test the reliability of the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) and Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS) between sessions and raters in the adult spinal deformity (ASD) population.Up to now evaluation in ASD was mainly based on static radiographic parameters. Recently literature showed that dynamic balance was a better predictor of health-related quality of life than radiographic parameters, stressing the importance of balance assessment. However, to the best of our knowledge, reliability of balance assessment tools has not yet been investigated in the ASD population.Twenty ASD patients participated in this study. Ten patients were included in the test-retest study, including repeated measurements. Ten patients were measured once, simultaneously but independently by three raters. Each participant performed two balance scales, namely the BESTest and the TCMS. Statistical analysis consisted of intra class correlations (ICC) on scale- and subscale level, and kappa scores on item-level. Cronbach's alpha on total scores, standard errors of measurement (SEM), smallest detectable differences and percentages of agreement were also calculated. Bland-altman plots were created to investigate systematic bias.ICC scores between sessions and raters for TCMS (0.76 and 0.88) and BESTest (0.90 and 0.94) total scores were good to excellent. SEM's between sessions and raters were also low for total scores on TCMS (1.66 and 2.35) and BESTest (2.99 and 2.32). However, on subscale- and item-level reliability decreased and ceiling effects were observed. No systematic bias was observed between sessions and raters.BESTest and TCMS showed to be reliable tools to measure balance in ASD on scale-level. However, on subscale- and item-level reliability decreased and ceiling effects were observed. Therefore, the question arises if there is need for an ASD-specific balance scale."
https://openalex.org/W2971030416,"Computer-assisted navigation (CAN) may guide spinal instrumentation, and requires alignment of patient anatomy to imaging. Iterative closest-point (ICP) algorithms register anatomical and imaging surface datasets, which may fail in the presence of geometric symmetry (congruence), leading to failed registration or inaccurate navigation. Here we computationally quantify geometric congruence in posterior spinal exposures, and identify predictors of potential navigation inaccuracy.Midline posterior exposures were performed from C1-S1 in four human cadavers. An optically-based CAN generated surface maps of the posterior elements at each level. Maps were reconstructed to include bilateral hemilamina, or unilateral hemilamina with/without the base of the spinous process. Maps were fitted to symmetrical geometries (cylindrical/spherical/planar) using computational modelling, and the degree of model fit quantified based on the ratio of model inliers to total points. Geometric congruence was subsequently assessed clinically in 11 patients undergoing midline exposures in the cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine for posterior instrumented fusion.In cadaveric testing, increased cylindrical/spherical/planar symmetry was seen in the high-cervical and subaxial cervical spine relative to the thoracolumbar spine (p<0.001). Extension of unilateral exposures to include the ipsilateral base of the spinous process decreased symmetry independent of spinal level (p<0.001). In clinical testing, increased cylindrical/spherical/planar symmetry was seen in the subaxial cervical relative to the thoracolumbar spine (p<0.001), and in the thoracic relative to the lumbar spine (p<0.001). Symmetry in unilateral exposures was decreased by 20% with inclusion of the ipsilateral base of the spinous process.Geometric congruence is most evident at C1 and the subaxial cervical spine, warranting greater vigilance in navigation accuracy verification. At all levels, inclusion of the base of the spinous process in unilateral registration decreases the likelihood of geometric symmetry and navigation error. This work is important to allow the extension of line-of-sight based registration techniques to minimally-invasive unilateral approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2970064529,"It remains unclear what is the real safe limit of torque magnitude during Bilateral Apical Vertebral Derotation (BAVD) in thoracic curve correction. Up to author's knowledge there is no study except this one, to reproduce in-vivo real measurements and intraoperative conditions during BAVD maneuver. The objective of this study was to evaluate the torsional strength of the instrumented thoracic spine under axial rotation moment as well as to define safety limits under BAVD corrective maneuver in scoliosis surgery. 10 fresh, full-length, young and intact human cadavers were tested. After proper assembly of the apparatus, the torque was applied through its apical part, simulating thoracic curve derotation. During each experiment the torque magnitude and angular range of derotation were evaluated. For more accurate analysis after every experiment the examined section of the spine was resected from the cadaver and evaluated morphologically and with a CT scan. The average torque to failure during BAVD simulation was 73,3 ± 5,49Nm. The average angle of BAVD to failure was 44,5 ± 8,16°. The majority of failures were in apical area. There was no significant difference between the fracture occurrence of left or right side of lateral wall of the pedicle. There was no spinal canal breach and/or medial wall failure in any specimen. The safety limits of thoracic spine and efficacy of BAVD for axial plane correction in the treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) were established. It provided qualitative and quantitative information essential for the spinal derotation under safe loading limits."
https://openalex.org/W2970553650,"Streptococcus agalactiae(GBS) is a seriously threat to the farmed tilapia, and oral vaccination was considered to be the most desirable means which requires deep understanding of virulence mechanism of the fish-derived GBS. Our previous genome study of the fish-derived attenuated strain YM001 showed that there were two large deletions in YM001 compared to its parental virulent strain HN016. In this study, a combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was performed on YM001 and HN016 strains, and the important genes were verified by RT-qPCR in bacteria strains and infected-tilapia tissues. Overall, we have shown that a total of 958 genes and 331 proteins were significantly differential expressed between YM001 and HN016. By functional annotation of these DEGs and DEPs, genes that were enriched in pentose phosphate pathway(pgm, ptsG, pgi pfkA, fbaA and FBP3) and pyruvate metabolism pathway(pdhA, pdhB, pdhC and pdhD) were identifed as important candidate genes for leads low growth ability in attenuated strain, which may be an important reasons leading virulence attenuation in the end. The expression levels the candidate genes in pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate metabolism pathway were significant differential expressed in tilapia' brain and spleen when infected with YM001 and HN016. Our study indicated that the pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate metabolism pathway that affecting the growth of the strain may be one of the important reasons for the virulence attenuation in HN016."

https://openalex.org/W2969769574,"Insulin and glucagon are well-known peptide hormones that keep glucose levels within a healthy range in the body. But they are only part of a complex network that controls concentrations of this ubiquitous sugar in blood and tissues. Other molecules regulate glucose by controlling insulin secretion from the pancreas or protecting pancreatic β cells against stresses that lead to cellular dysfunction or cell death (1Fu Z. Gilbert E.R. Liu D. Regulation of insulin synthesis and secretion and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in diabetes.Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2013; 9 (22974359): 25-5310.2174/157339913804143225Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). One of these protective regulators is glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a 30-amino-acid-long peptide produced in specialized epithelial cells of the intestine, called L cells, and also in the brain and other organs and tissues (2Drucker D.J. Habener J.F. Holst J.J. Discovery, characterization, and clinical development of the glucagon-like peptides.J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 (29202475): 4217-422710.1172/JCI97233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). GLP-1 belongs to a group of peptides that mediate the “incretin effect,” an endocrine response to glucose arising from food digestion in the intestines (2Drucker D.J. Habener J.F. Holst J.J. Discovery, characterization, and clinical development of the glucagon-like peptides.J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 (29202475): 4217-422710.1172/JCI97233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 3Holst J.J. The physiology of glucagon-like peptide-1.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87 (17928588): 1409-143910.1152/physrev.00034.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). This response helps regulate food intake and the fate of dietary glucose. Specifically, GLP-1 is released from the intestinal cells when food is ingested and then binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein–coupled receptor on many cell types, including β cells in which GLP-1R signaling stimulates insulin synthesis and secretion (3Holst J.J. The physiology of glucagon-like peptide-1.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87 (17928588): 1409-143910.1152/physrev.00034.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Notably, the incretin effect stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells more strongly than exposure to glucose alone. An article published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry (4Li Y. Hansotia T. Yusta B. Ris F. Halban P.A. Drucker D.J. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor signaling modulates β cell apoptosis.J. Biol.

This finding was significant for preventing or managing type 2 diabetes, in which β-cell apoptosis occurs (5Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Pancreatic islet cell toxicity of amylin associated with type-2 diabetes mellitus.Nature. 1994; 368 (8152488): 756-76010.1038/368756a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and may contribute to insufficient pancreatic insulin production (6Prentki M. Nolan C.J. Islet beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116 (16823478): 1802-181210.1172/JCI29103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Yazhou Li and Daniel Drucker at Toronto General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, along with colleagues exposed WT and GLP-1R–knockout mice to the compound streptozotocin, which induces β-cell death, in the presence and absence of the specific GLP-1R agonist exendin-4. The authors then assessed the effect of the GLP-1R stimulation on glucose tolerance, blood and pancreatic insulin levels, and pancreatic cell viability and proliferation. To find out what spurred this seminal paper and to learn more about its findings, JBC reached out to Drucker, now at the Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mt. Sinai Hospital, in Toronto. GLP-1 had previously been shown to expand β-cell mass by stimulating β-cell proliferation. We wondered whether GLP-1 might also contribute to the control of β-cell mass by reducing cell death. We were also aware that cell-survival pathways were activated by cAMP, an important downstream messenger that is increased by GLP-1R activation. We made several interesting discoveries. First, pharmacological activation of the GLP-1R with exendin-4 reduced β-cell death we had produced by experimental pancreatic injury with streptozotocin in mice. We noted that this reduction in β-cell apoptosis is associated with preservation of β-cell function and glucose homeostasis in the mice. Second, we found that basal GLP-1R signaling is physiologically essential for β-cell survival, as the GLP-1R–knockout mice exhibited enhanced β-cell injury when challenged with streptozotocin. Third, we saw that GLP-1's anti-apoptotic activities are direct, and we, that is, our collaborator Philippe Halban, could also demonstrate them ex vivo in purified rat β cells exposed to cytotoxic cytokines, a model of tissue inflammation. We also discovered that GLP-1's anti-apoptotic properties are not unique to β cells and can be conferred to heterologous cells transfected with the gene encoding GLP-1R. We used exendin-4 because it is a highly stable, degradation-resistant GLP-1R agonist that is more biologically potent in animals and humans than is GLP-1. It was also the lead GLP-1R agonist in clinical trials and became the first GLP-1 drug approved for the management of diabetes. In most tissues, there is little evidence that continuous GLP-1R activation by agonists down-regulates this receptor. This fortuitous finding enables the development of long-acting GLP-1R agonists for managing diabetes and obesity. This has always been a theoretical concern, but there's no evidence that would support it. The first GLP-1R agonist (exenatide, the common drug name for exendin-4, used in diabetes management) was approved for clinical use as an antidiabetic medication in April, 2005. After 14 years of clinical use, with multiple drugs and millions of patients taking the medication, we have not seen an increase in cancer rates due to exenatide or GLP-1R agonist use. Both GLP-1 and another peptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), are important naturally occurring incretin hormones. GIP is likely the more important incretin under physiological conditions. And, yes, most peptide ligands that, like GLP-1, increase cAMP levels in β cells—such as pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptide (PACAP), GIP, and fatty acids—also reduce β-cell apoptosis. Before our study, I do not think anyone had clearly addressed the question of whether GLP-1R signaling can inhibit β-cell death. Since our JBC publication, GLP-1R signaling has been shown to reduce cell death in many cell types, from β cells to neurons, to endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. As for progress in the field, research into both the basic science and clinical relevance of GLP-1 has expanded tremendously since 2003. GLP-1R agonists are approved for treating patients with diabetes or obesity and are under investigation for managing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and neurological disorders. We continue to explore the mechanisms underlying GLP-1 action in numerous cells and tissues. In 2002, only 196 published studies of GLP-1 were listed in PubMed. In 2018 alone, there were 1461, and the field continues to grow. This is a little difficult to appreciate. The paper has been widely cited [author's note: at this writing, it has been cited 712 times in Google Scholar], and it was one of the first studies to highlight a cytoprotective role and not just an insulin-secretory role for GLP-1. It's also noteworthy that GLP-1 has recently shown some promise in clinical trials investigating its therapeutic role in human neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and it continues to be explored for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease. So the concept that GLP-1 might generally protect vulnerable cells continues to have high clinical relevance."
