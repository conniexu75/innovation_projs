https://openalex.org/W2159168998,"A gene, ATM, that is mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT) was identified by positional cloning on chromosome 11q22-23. AT is characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, cancer predisposition, radiation sensitivity, and cell cycle abnormalities. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, with four complementation groups that have been suspected to represent different genes. ATM, which has a transcript of 12 kilobases, was found to be mutated in AT patients from all complementation groups, indicating that it is probably the sole gene responsible for this disorder. A partial ATM complementary DNA clone of 5.9 kilobases encoded a putative protein that is similar to several yeast and mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3â€² kinases that are involved in mitogenic signal transduction, meiotic recombination, and cell cycle control. The discovery of ATM should enhance understanding of AT and related syndromes and may allow the identification of AT heterozygotes, who are at increased risk of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2005275397,"A transcriptional transactivator was developed that fuses the VP16 activation domain with a mutant Tet repressor from Escherichia coli. This transactivator requires certain tetracycline (Tc) derivatives for specific DNA binding. Thus, addition of doxycycline to HeLa cells that constitutively synthesized the transactivator and that contained an appropriate, stably integrated reporter unit rapidly induced gene expression more than a thousandfold. The specificity of the Tet repressor-operator-effector interaction and the pharmacological characteristics of Tc's make this regulatory system well suited for the control of gene activities in vivo, such as in transgenic animals and possibly in gene therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2085936836,"Deficiency in monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), an enzyme that degrades serotonin and norepinephrine, has recently been shown to be associated with aggressive behavior in men of a Dutch family. A line of transgenic mice was isolated in which transgene integration caused a deletion in the gene encoding MAOA, providing an animal model of MAOA deficiency. In pup brains, serotonin concentrations were increased up to ninefold, and serotonin-like immunoreactivity was present in catecholaminergic neurons. In pup and adult brains, norepinephrine concentrations were increased up to twofold, and cytoarchitectural changes were observed in the somatosensory cortex. Pup behavioral alterations, including trembling, difficulty in righting, and fearfulness were reversed by the serotonin synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Adults manifested a distinct behavioral syndrome, including enhanced aggression in males."

https://openalex.org/W2079924875,"Electron coupling through a beta strand has been investigated by measurement of the intramolecular electron-transfer (ET) rates in ruthenium-modified derivatives of the beta barrel blue copper protein Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin. Surface histidines, introduced on the methionine-121 beta strand by mutagenesis, were modified with a Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)2(imidazole)2+ complex. The Cu+ to Ru3+ rate constants yielded a distance-decay constant of 1.1 per angstrom, a value close to the distance-decay constant of 1.0 per angstrom predicted for electron tunneling through an idealized beta strand. Activationless ET rate constants in combination with a tunneling-pathway analysis of the structures of azurin and cytochrome c confirm that there is a generally efficient network for coupling the internal (native) redox center to the surface of both proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1987063642,"The crystal structure of the tryptic core fragment of the lac repressor of Escherichia coli (LacR) complexed with the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside was determined at 2.6 A resolution. The quaternary structure consists of two dyad-symmetric dimers that are nearly parallel to each other. This structure places all four DNA binding domains of intact LacR on the same side of the tetramer, and results in a deep, V-shaped cleft between the two dimers. Each monomer contributes a carboxyl-terminal helix to an antiparallel four-helix bundle that functions as a tetramerization domain. Some of the side chains whose mutation reduce DNA binding form clusters on a surface near the amino terminus. Placing the structure of the DNA binding domain complexed with operator previously determined by nuclear magnetic resonance onto this surface results in two operators being adjacent and nearly parallel to each other. Structural considerations suggest that the two dimers of LacR may flexibly alter their relative orientation in order to bind to the known varied spacings between two operators."

https://openalex.org/W2029749772,"In plants, the growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is found both free and conjugated to a variety of amino acids, peptides, and carbohydrates. IAA conjugated to leucine has effects in Arabidopsis thaliana similar to those of free IAA. The ilr1 mutant is insensitive to exogenous IAA-Leu and was used to positionally clone the Arabidopsis ILR1 gene. ILR1 encodes a 48-kilodalton protein that cleaves IAA-amino acid conjugates in vitro and is homologous to bacterial amidohydrolase enzymes. DNA sequences similar to that of ILR1 are found in other plant species."

https://openalex.org/W2006726587,"A soluble adenylyl cyclase was constructed by linkage of portions of the cytosolic domains of the mammalian type I and type II enzymes. The soluble enzyme was stimulated by both forskolin and the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) Gs (Gs alpha). Expression of the construct complemented the catabolic defect in a strain of Escherichia coli that is deficient in adenylyl cyclase activity. The active, approximately 60-kilodalton enzyme accumulated in the cytoplasmic fraction of E. coli to yield activities in excess of 1 nanomole per minute per milligram of protein. The two sets of transmembrane helices of mammalian adenylyl cyclases are thus not necessary for the catalytic or the most characteristic regulatory activities of the enzyme. This system may be useful for both genetic and biochemical analysis of G protein-regulated adenylyl cyclases."

https://openalex.org/W1550544725,"Abstract The human beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) (SiaT-1) gene is localized to human chromosome 3 (q21-q28) by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes. Comparative analysis between the human and the previously reported rat SiaT-1 genomic sequences demonstrates precise conservation of the intron/exon boundaries throughout the coding domains. Furthermore, there is extensive inter-species sequence similarity in some of the exons that contain information only for the 5'-leader regions. Human genomic sequences were also analyzed to reconcile reported differences in the 5'-untranslated region in SiaT-1 mRNAs. In cultured cell lines of the B-lineage, Reh, Nalm-6, Jok-1, Ball-1, Daudi, and Louckes, the study demonstrates that three upstream exons, Exons(Y+Z) and Exon(X), are mutually exclusively utilized, resulting in at least two distinct populations of SiaT-1 mRNA being synthesized. None of these exons is present in the SiaT-1 mRNA isotype expressed in HepG2 human hepatoma cells. In all B-lymphoblastoid cell lines examined, the basal level SiaT-1 mRNA is maintained by the expression of an isotype containing the Exons(Y+Z) sequence. The slightly smaller SiaT-1 mRNA, which contains the Exon(X) sequence but not Exons(Y+Z) sequence, is synthesized at a high level and found only in Jok-1, Daudi, and Louckes, the cell lines with mature B-cell phenotype. The study also provides further evidence that induced SiaT-1 expression accompanies the appearance of CDw75, a putatively sialylated cell surface epitope and a marker of human mature B-lymphocytes. The SiaT-1 induction is the result of the appearance of a novel form of SiaT-1 mRNA isotype."

https://openalex.org/W2060049336,"The rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals is catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a four-electron oxidoreductase that converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The crystal structure of HMG-CoA reductase from Pseudomonas mevalonii was determined at 3.0 angstrom resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement. The structure reveals a tightly bound dimer that brings together at the subunit interface the conserved residues implicated in substrate binding and catalysis. These dimers are packed about a threefold crystallographic axis, forming a hexamer with 23 point group symmetry. Difference Fourier studies reveal the binding sites for the substrates HMG-CoA and reduced or oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD(H)] and demonstrate that the active sites are at the dimer interfaces. The HMG-CoA is bound by a domain with an unusual fold, consisting of a central alpha helix surrounded by a triangular set of walls of beta sheets and alpha helices. The NAD(H) is bound by a domain characterized by an antiparallel beta structure that defines a class of dinucleotide-binding domains."
