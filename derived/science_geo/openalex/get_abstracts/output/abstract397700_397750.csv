Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) activity reflected experimental changes in self-location that also depended on the first-person perspective due to visuo-tactile and visuo-vestibular conflicts.

What are the brain mechanisms involved in this process? Extending earlier data from neurological patients (Critchley, 1953Critchley M. The Parietal Lobes.

Masson, Paris1952Google Scholar, Schilder, 1935Schilder P. The image and appearance of the human body. K. Paul, Trench, Trubner & co., London1935Google Scholar), recent neurological theories stress the importance of bodily processing for the self and self-consciousness. These theories highlight the importance of interoceptive, proprioceptive, and motor signals and their multisensory and sensorimotor integration with other bodily signals (Damasio, 1999Damasio A.R.

Metzinger T. Full-body illusions and minimal phenomenal selfhood.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2009; 13: 7-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Data from neurological patients suffering from out-of-body experiences (OBEs) provide such evidence, showing that focal brain damage may lead to pathological changes of the first-person perspective and self-location (Blanke et al., 2002Blanke O.

Med. 2007; 357: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), due to interference with the integration of multisensory bodily information at the TPJ. It was argued that such changes in first-person perspective and self-location are due to a double disintegration of bodily signals, a disintegration between somatosensory (proprioceptive and tactile) and visual signals combined with an additional visuo-vestibular disintegration (Blanke et al., 2004Blanke O.

Moreover, there is a low number of investigated cases, and OBEs have been associated with many different brain structures: the right and left TPJ (Blanke et al., 2002Blanke O. Ortigue S. Landis T.

Autoscopic phenomena with seizures.Arch. Neurol. 1989; 46: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is not clear which of these structures are involved in abnormal conscious states of first-person perspective and self-location and the significance of these clinical findings for self-consciousness under normal conditions. Recent behavioral and physiological work, using video-projection and various visuo-tactile conflicts, showed that self-location can also be manipulated experimentally in healthy participants (Ehrsson, 2007Ehrsson H.H. The experimental induction of out-of-body experiences.Science. 2007; 317: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, Lenggenhager et al., 2007Lenggenhager B. Tadi T. Metzinger T. Blanke O. Video ergo sum: manipulating bodily self-consciousness.Science. 2007; 317: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Thus, synchronous stroking of the participant's back and the back of a visually presented virtual body led to changes in self-location (toward a virtual body at a position outside the participant's bodily borders) and self-identification with the virtual body (Lenggenhager et al., 2007Lenggenhager B. Tadi T. Metzinger T. Blanke O. Video ergo sum: manipulating bodily self-consciousness.Science. 2007; 317: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). So far, these experimental findings and techniques have not been integrated with neuroimaging, such as fMRI, probably because the above-mentioned experimental setups require participants to sit, stand, or move, and it is difficult to apply and film the visuo-tactile conflicts on the participant's body in a well-controlled manner during standard fMRI acquisitions. The neural mechanisms of a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness, self-location, under normal and pathological conditions have therefore remained elusive and are addressed here. In the present fMRI study, we adapted a previous research protocol to the MR-environment: the “Mental Ball Dropping” (MBD) task (Lenggenhager et al., 2009Lenggenhager B. Mouthon M. Blanke O. Spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness.Conscious. Cogn. 2009; 18: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We manipulated the synchrony between the stroking of the participant's back and the back of a visually presented virtual human body to induce changes in self-location. In the MBD task, participants were asked to estimate the time that a ball they were holding in their hands would take to hit the ground if they were to release it, providing repeated quantifiable measurements of self-location (height above the ground) during scanning (see Supplemental Information available online). We expected longer response times (RTs) for higher self-location and shorter RTs for lower self-location (Lenggenhager et al., 2009Lenggenhager B. Mouthon M. Blanke O. Spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness.Conscious. Cogn. 2009; 18: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The visual stimuli in the experimental conditions (Supplemental Information), presented through video goggles, consisted of short movies showing a back view of the virtual body filmed from an elevated position (Lenggenhager et al., 2009Lenggenhager B. Mouthon M. Blanke O. Spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness.Conscious. Cogn. 2009; 18: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (body conditions) being stroked by a sphere positioned at the end of a rod and moving vertically along the midline of the virtual person's back (Figure 1A ). The video during the control conditions only showed the moving rod and stimulator without the person's body (no-body conditions; Figure 1B). A custom-built robotic device (Figures 1C and 1D) allowed us to control the trajectory of tactile stimulation of the participant's back in both body and control conditions (using the same movement profile). This trajectory either matched (synchronous) or did not match (asynchronous) the applied tactile stimuli to the visually displayed position of the virtual rod (Supplemental Information). Thus, we precisely controlled the spatial and temporal aspects of the stimulation sphere's movement during scanning within and across participants (Supplemental Information). Participants performed the MBD task under four different conditions according to a 2 × 2 factorial design with Object (body; no-body) and Stroking (synchronous; asynchronous) as main factors. Immediately after the fMRI session (before the acquisition of the anatomical images), participants completed a six-items questionnaire (Supplemental Information) to measure the experienced direction of the first-person perspective and illusory self-identification with the virtual body (Lenggenhager et al., 2007Lenggenhager B. Tadi T. Metzinger T. Blanke O. Video ergo sum: manipulating bodily self-consciousness.Science. 2007; 317: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) (Table S1). To define the structures that are involved in abnormal states of first-person perspective and self-location, we also studied a large group of neurological patients suffering from OBEs (Blanke et al., 2002Blanke O. Ortigue S. Landis T. Seeck M. Stimulating illusory own-body perceptions.Nature. 2002; 419: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, Blanke et al., 2004Blanke O. Landis T. Spinelli L.

Feldmann E. Burrowes K. Bromfield E. Autoscopic phenomena with seizures.Arch. Neurol. 1989; 46: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Maillard et al., 2004Maillard L. Vignal J.P. Anxionnat R. Taillandier L. Vespignani H. Semiologic value of ictal autoscopy.Epilepsia. 2004; 45: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We performed quantitative lesion analysis (Rorden et al., 2007Rorden C. Karnath H.O. Bonilha L. Improving lesion-symptom mapping.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2007; 19: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) and compared the distribution of brain lesions in nine OBE-patients with those of eight other patients showing complex hallucinations involving people or faces, but without abnormal self-location, self-identification, or first-person perspective (control group; Table S3). This allowed us to determine the anatomical sub-regions of maximal lesion overlap and to perform statistical comparisons contrasting the lesions of OBE and control patients (voxel-based lesion symptom mapping; VLSM) (Bates et al., 2003Bates E. Wilson S.M. Saygin A.P. Dick F. Sereno M.I. Knight R.T. Dronkers N.F. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Based on previous data in patients with OBEs, we predicted to find maximal involvement of the TPJ. Based on these clinical data, we also predicted that the BOLD response of this structure in healthy subjects would reflect changes in self-location that are dependent on the experimental factors Stroking and Object. Importantly, we further predicted that TPJ activity should also reflect changes in self-location that depend on the direction of the first-person perspective because (1) such changes are a key element of OBEs and because (2) we were able to manipulate the experienced direction of the first-person perspective and its influence on self-location with our robotic stroking setup (interaction between Stroking, Object, and Perspective; see next section). Earlier pilot questionnaire data revealed that, next to self-location and self-identification, we were also able to manipulate the experienced direction of the first-person perspective. In the pilot study, several participants mentioned spontaneously that they felt as if they were looking down at the virtual body (even though they were physically in a supine position and facing upward). Thus, for the present study, we added a related question (question 1; Q1) to the questionnaire (Table S1). To answer Q1, while being still within the MR-scanner, our participants were asked to indicate the direction of their experienced first-person perspective by placing a cursor on one out of three possible answers (up, not sure, down). After the fMRI session, all participants were, in addition, asked to write a free report about their experience during the stroking (Table 1; Table S4). With respect to Q1, participants who chose the “not sure” response were also interviewed after the experiment and asked to estimate which perspective they used most of the time. On the basis of both written free reports and interviews, the most frequent perspective across conditions was determined for these participants and allowed us to assign all participants to either the Up- or the Down-group. As in the pilot study, in the present study we found that many participants reported looking always upward (n = 10) or looking for most of the time upward (n = 1) at the virtual body located above them (i.e., congruent with their physical perspective: Up-group, n = 11). Selected experiences of the Up-group participants during the synchronous and asynchronous body conditions are listed in Table 1A. The remaining participants reported that they had the impression that they were always looking down (n = 6) or were for most of the time looking down (n = 5) at the virtual body located below them (i.e., incongruent with their physical perspective: Down-group, n = 11). Selected experiences of the Down-group participants during the synchronous and asynchronous body conditions are listed in Table 1B. In summary, whereas several participants felt as if they were looking upward at the virtual body “above them” (Up-group), the remaining participants had the impression that they were looking down at the virtual body “below them” (Down-group). This was found despite somatosensory, motor, and cognitive cues from our participants about their body position (they were lying on their back, facing upward, and were head-constrained in the head coil; Figure 1E; Supplemental Information). Based on these findings, we carried out data analysis considering each group of participants. This led to a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design with Perspective (up; down) as in-between factor, and Object (body; no-body) and Stroking (synchronous; asynchronous) as within factors that were applied to the analysis of self-location, self-identification, and the fMRI data.Table 1Free Reports during Robotic Visuo-Tactile StrokingAConditionUp-GroupS3S“This time the only thing that made me doubt that the filmed body was not me, is that I could not see the hands.

I had the impression of feeling the impact of a surface on my back as if I was touching the roof.”Participants were asked to write down what they experienced during synchronous (S) and asynchronous (AS) visuo-tactile stroking conditions. Selected responses are listed for participants from the Up-group (A) and the Down-group (B).See also Table S4. Open table in a new tab Participants were asked to write down what they experienced during synchronous (S) and asynchronous (AS) visuo-tactile stroking conditions. Selected responses are listed for participants from the Up-group (A) and the Down-group (B). See also Table S4. Statistical analysis of RTs in the MBD task showed that self-location depended on Object, Stroking, and Perspective [significant three-way interaction; F(1,20) = 4.4; p < 0.05]. Post hoc comparisons showed that in the body conditions, the participants of the Up-group (participants experiencing themselves to be looking upward at the visually presented body) estimated self-location as higher (longer RTs) during the synchronous (1071 ms) compared with the asynchronous stroking (991 ms; p < 0.01; Figure 2A ). The opposite pattern was found in the Down-group (participants experiencing that they were looking downward at the visually presented body): lower self-location and shorter RTs during the synchronous stroking (1047 ms) with respect to the asynchronous stroking while viewing the body (1138 ms; p < 0.03; Figure 2B). No significant differences were found between synchronous and asynchronous stroking in the control conditions in both groups (all p > 0.2; see Figures 2A and 2B). Notably, RTs in the body conditions are modulated, within each group, as a function of stroking and the experienced direction of the first-person perspective. Thus, self-location changes for the Up-group were characterized by a generally lower self-location that was further modulated by stroking in the upward direction (toward the seen virtual body), whereas self-location changes for the Down-group were characterized by a generally higher self-location that was further modulated by stroking in the downward direction (toward the seen virtual body) (see Figure 2). For other effects see Supplemental Information. Our questionnaire results showed that predictable changes in self-identification and illusory touch, depending on the factors Object and Stroking, can be induced using robotic stroking in the fMRI environment. As predicted, and in accordance with previous work (Ehrsson, 2007Ehrsson H.H. The experimental induction of out-of-body experiences.Science. 2007; 317: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, Lenggenhager et al., 2007Lenggenhager B. Tadi T. Metzinger T. Blanke O.

Spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness.Conscious. Cogn. 2009; 18: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), statistical analysis of the questionnaires (Supplemental Information) showed that, regardless of Perspective, responses to Q3 (“How strong was the feeling that the body you saw was you?”) indicated stronger self-identification [F(4,80) = 13.5; p < 0.01] with the virtual body during synchronous (4.1) than asynchronous stroking (2.3), and that responses to Q5 (“How strong was the feeling that the touch you felt was located where you saw the stroking?”) indicated stronger illusory touch [F(4,80) = 13.5; p < 0.001] during the synchronous (8.1) than the asynchronous stroking (2.8; Figure 3; Supplemental Information). To summarize these findings, participants from the Up-group experienced themselves to be looking up at the body above them (Q1), self-identified with that body during synchronous stimulation (Q3), and experienced themselves to be spatially closer to the seen virtual body during synchronous stimulation (free reports). We argue that this was associated—at least partly—with compatible changes in self-location (mental ball dropping task): a low position or level of self-location (comparable to those indicated during the control conditions; see blue line in Figure 2A) and a drift in self-location characterized by an elevation during synchronous versus asynchronous stroking (difference between the two gray bodies in Figure 2A). This was different in participants from the Down-group. They felt themselves to be looking down at the body below them (different from participants from the Up-group), self-identified with that body during synchronous stimulation (as participants from the Up-group), and experienced themselves to be spatially closer with the virtual body during synchronous stimulation (as participants from the Up-group). We note that some free reports also suggested that they experienced themselves to be floating and to be elevated during asynchronous stroking. This was associated—at least partly—with compatible changes in self-location (mental ball dropping task): a high position or level of self-location during asynchronous stroking (comparable to those indicated during the control conditions; see blue lines in Figure 2B) and a drift in self-location characterized by a descent during synchronous versus asynchronous stroking (difference between the two gray bodies in Figure 2B that is opposite in direction with respect to the drift-related change in self-location in the Up-group; black arrows in Figure 2). We next analyzed whether changes in illusory self-location—based on the experimental factors of Stroking, Object, and Perspective—were reflected in the fMRI data. Group-level whole-brain analysis indicated seven cortical regions where the BOLD signal was significantly different during any of the eight conditions compared to the baseline condition (Figure 4). These regions (Table S2) were located at the left and right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), left and right postcentral gyrus (Figures 4A–4C), left and right temporo-occipital cortex (posterior middle and inferior temporal gyri, or extrastriate body area; EBA), and bilateral occipital lobe (Figure 4D). To target brain regions reflecting self-location (as measured by the MBD task; Figure 2) we searched for activity that could not be accounted for by the summation of the effects of seeing the body, feeling synchronous stroking, and the spontaneously reported perspective. Based on our subjective and behavioral data on self-location, we searched for BOLD responses that reflected changes in self-location (i.e., BOLD responses that depend on Stroking and Object), and that also differed for the two perspective groups. Only brain regions revealing a Stroking by Object by Perspective interaction may reflect the induced changes in self-location, whereas brain activity revealing a Stroking by Object interaction may reflect self-identification with the seen virtual body. Such activity was only found in the left and right TPJ. No other brain region revealed BOLD signal changes that reflected such illusory changes in self-location. Although activity in right and left EBA and occipital cortex also revealed a three-way interaction, activity in these regions did not reflect self-location (see the Supplemental Information). The left TPJ activation was centered on the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). Mimicking behavioral changes in self-location and the reported first-person perspective, left TPJ activation in the Up- and Down-groups differed between synchronous and asynchronous stroking only during the body conditions (Figure 4A). In the Up-group, the BOLD response during the synchronous-body condition (−0.14%) was lower than in the asynchronous-body condition [0.73%; F(1,20) = 6.1; p < 0.02]. The opposite effect was found in the Down-group, where the BOLD response during the synchronous-body condition (1.22%) was higher than in the asynchronous-body condition (0.42%; p < 0.03). The difference between synchronous and asynchronous stroking in the control conditions was not significant in both groups (all p > 0.15; Supplemental Information). We also found a significant Perspective by Stroking interaction (Supplemental Information). No other main effect or interaction was significant in this region (Supplemental Information). The cluster at the right TPJ was also centered on the pSTG, and the BOLD response in this region also differed between synchronous and asynchronous stroking during the body conditions for both groups (Figure 4C). In the Up-group we found a lower BOLD response during synchronous (0.11%) than asynchronous stroking [1.14%; F(1, 20) = 7; p < 0.016], whereas in the Down-group we found the opposite trend with a higher BOLD response during the synchronous (1.03%) than the asynchronous stroking condition (0.34%; p = 0.09). The BOLD response was not significantly different between synchronous and asynchronous stroking in the control conditions in both groups (all p > 0.32). No other main effect or interaction was significant in this region (Supplemental Information). To target brain regions reflecting self-identification (as measured by the questionnaire; question Q3; Figure 3) we searched for activity that could not be accounted for by"

A combination of genetic and environmental risk factors probably contributes to MD. We present data from a genome-wide association study revealing a neuron-specific neutral amino acid transporter (SLC6A15) as a susceptibility gene for MD. Risk allele carrier status in humans and chronic stress in mice were associated with a downregulation of the expression of this gene in the hippocampus, a brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of MD. The same polymorphisms also showed associations with alterations in hippocampal volume and neuronal integrity. Thus, decreased SLC6A15 expression, due to genetic or environmental factors, might alter neuronal circuits related to the susceptibility for MD. Our convergent data from human genetics, expression studies, brain imaging, and animal models suggest a pathophysiological mechanism for MD that may be accessible to drug targeting.

It is not only a potentially fatal disease with about 2% of patients committing suicide (Bostwick and Pankratz, 2000Bostwick J.M. Pankratz V.S.

Psychiatry. 2000; 157: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) but also one of the leading causes worldwide for loss in work productivity (Ebmeier et al., 2006Ebmeier K.P. Donaghey C.

Current treatments are indispensable but their clinical efficacy is still unsatisfactory, as reflected by high rates of treatment resistance and side effects (Fava and Rush, 2006Fava M. Rush A.J.

The heritability of this disorder has been estimated to range from 34%–42% (95% CI) (Ebmeier et al., 2006Ebmeier K.P. Donaghey C. Steele J.D.

In candidate gene studies, BDNF, SLC6A4, ACE, P2RX7, TPH2, PDE9A, PDE11A, DISC1, and GRIK3 have been reported to be associated with the disease (Levinson, 2006Levinson D.F.

Only a few of these initial reports have been confirmed by subsequent studies or in meta-analyses. In the last years, the first genome-wide association (GWA) case-control studies in MD were published. None reported genome-wide significant results, and their top hits were difficult to replicate (Lewis et al., 2010Lewis C.M. Ng M.Y. Butler A.W. Cohen-Woods S. Uher R. Pirlo K. Weale M.E. Schosser A.

Phenotypic diversity and genetic heterogeneity as well as a considerable environmental contribution inherent to MD have been considered to represent major obstacles for the identification of causative variants.

The herein reported association results are based on an overall sample size of 15,089 unrelated individuals. To further characterize the functional relevance of the identified locus, we analyzed genotypic influences of associated SNPs on premortem human hippocampus and lymphoblastoid cell line expression profiles. We also employed in vivo high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR) with a focus on the hippocampal formation. We selected this brain region based on our gene expression results and because decreased neuronal integrity in this brain region had previously been identified as a risk factor for major depression (Frodl et al., 2002Frodl T. Meisenzahl E.M. Zetzsche T. Born C. Groll C. Jäger M. Leinsinger G. Bottlender R. Hahn K. Möller H.J. Hippocampal changes in patients with a first episode of major depression.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2002; 159: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Moreover, we investigated a possible role of the candidate locus in mediating stress vulnerability by interrogating its hippocampal expression in a well-established mouse model of chronic social stress (Schmidt et al., 2007Schmidt M.V. Sterlemann V. Ganea K. Liebl C. Alam S. Harbich D. Greetfeld M. Uhr M. Holsboer F. Müller M.B.

Work stress as a risk factor for major depressive episode(s).Psychol. Med. 2005; 35: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We performed a GWA study in a sample of 353 unipolar depressed German inpatients from the MARS study (Hennings et al., 2009Hennings J.M. Owashi T. Binder E.B. Horstmann S. Menke A. Kloiber S. Dose T.

Messer T. et al.Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome in a representative sample of depressed inpatients - findings from the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature (MARS) project.J.

After applying stringent quality-control criteria (see Experimental Procedures), 365,676 SNPs entered association analysis. Neither genomic controls nor Eigenstrat showed evidence for population stratification in this sample (Figure S1). The common SNP rs1545843 (MAF = 0.41 in controls) on chr12q21.31 showed experiment-wide significance in a recessive mode of inheritance (AA versus AG+GG) after applying the permutation-based minimum p method for multiple comparison correction over all tested SNPs and genetic models (Table 1, Figure 1B , and Figure S2; n = 353/366, nominal p = 5.53e-08; OR = 2.84 [95% CI 1.92–4.21]). Seven additional common SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1545843 located in a region spanning about 450 kb gave nominal p values smaller than 5.0e-04 applying the recessive model (Table 1, Figure 1B, and Figure S2). The pairwise r2 values ranged from 0.40 to > 0.99 in controls (Figure 2A and Figure S2A), suggesting that all eight SNPs might tag the same underlying causative variant. In fact, rs1545843 and rs1031681 can be used as tagging SNPs for the associated variants within this locus in Europeans and fall into two separate bins, with an interbin r squared of 0.67.Table 1Association Results of the Discovery GWAS and the First Round of ReplicationSNP (Position on chr12, hg18)AllelesaThe allele shown in bold confers greater odds that the carrier is a case (risk allele for depression).

We then genotyped the genome-wide significant SNP (rs1545843) of the GWA study together with seven to nineteen SNPs in LD within this locus in five independent samples. These comprised three German case-control samples, including two samples for which GWA data have been published (Muglia et al., 2010Muglia P. Tozzi F. Galwey N.W. Francks C. Upmanyu R. Kong X.Q.

The German samples consist of patients with recurrent MD and matched controls screened for the absence of lifetime anxiety and mood disorders recruited in Southern Germany (n = 920/1024) (Muglia et al., 2010Muglia P. Tozzi F. Galwey N.W. Francks C. Upmanyu R. Kong X.Q. Antoniades A. Domenici E. Perry J. Rothen S. et al.Genome-wide association study of recurrent major depressive disorder in two European case-control cohorts.Mol. Psychiatry. 2010; 15: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), patients with major depression and controls recruited around the German city of Bonn (n = 292/1155), as well as patients and controls recruited as a follow-up of the discovery sample (n = 300/236). In addition, the association was tested in a sample from the Netherlands. In the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study subsample (n = 1160) (Choy et al., 2009Choy W.C. López-León S. Aulchenko Y.S. Mackenbach J.P. Oostra B.A. van Duijn C.M. Janssens A.C. Role of shared genetic and environmental factors in symptoms of depression and body composition.Psychiatr. Genet. 2009; 19: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), symptoms of depression during the past week were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D). To create a proxy for case/control status, we compared the individuals rating in the upper depression scale quartile (CES-D ≥ 16.0: cases, indicative of a depressive disorder [Luijendijk et al., 2008Luijendijk H.J. van den Berg J.F. Dekker M.J. van Tuijl H.R. Otte W. Smit F. Hofman A. Stricker B.H. Tiemeier H. Incidence and recurrence of late-life depression.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2008; 65: 1394-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar]) with those rating in the lower quartile (CES-D ≤ 3: controls). Finally, we tested for association of the identified locus in a cross-sectional study of African-American subjects with significant levels of trauma recruited in the waiting rooms of an urban public hospital in Atlanta (n = 991) (Binder et al., 2008Binder E.B. Bradley R.G. Liu W. Epstein M.P. Deveau T.C. Mercer K.B. Tang Y. Gillespie C.F. Heim C.M. Nemeroff C.B. et al.Association of FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood abuse with risk of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults.JAMA. 2008; 299: 1291-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Depression was rated by using the quantitative Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In contrast to populations of European descent these SNPs displayed much less LD among each other (Figure 2B). For this study, we also created a proxy for case-control status. As BDI scores higher than 16 are equated to clinically relevant symptoms of current MD (Viinamäki et al., 2004Viinamäki H. Tanskanen A. Honkalampi K. Koivumaa-Honkanen H. Haatainen K. Kaustio O. Hintikka J. Is the Beck Depression Inventory suitable for screening major depression in different phases of the disease?.Nord. J. Psychiatry. 2004; 58: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we divided the sample at this cutoff for a case-control analysis. Table 1 shows the results of the association in all six samples for rs1545843 as well as two SNPs in moderate LD with it, rs1031681 and rs7975057. Testing the recessive model of rs1545843, we observed nominally significant association in four of the five replication samples, with the same direction of the effect in all samples. A meta-analysis conducted across all samples resulted in a genome-wide significant association with a p value of 2.34e-08 (4.37e-08 corrected for three tested genetic models) for the recessive model of rs1545843 (see Table 1). Homozygote carriers of the A-allele of this SNP had a 1.42-fold-higher risk to suffer from depression and depressive symptoms compared to carriers of the two other genotypes. To replicate the genome-wide significant association of increased risk for depression in homozygous carriers of the A-allele of rs1545843, we performed an additional replication study with the UK cases and controls of the RADIANT study (Lewis et al., 2010Lewis C.M. Ng M.Y. Butler A.W. Cohen-Woods S. Uher R. Pirlo K. Weale M.E. Schosser A. Paredes U.M. Rivera M. et al.Genome-wide association study of major recurrent depression in the U.K. population.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2010; 167: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and added the WTCCC2 control cohorts. This resulted in a cohort of 1636 cases with recurrent unipolar depression and 7246 controls. An analysis using logistic regression showed significant evidence both for an effect of the AA genotype on risk in the same direction as in the other studies (OR = 1.344, 95% CI 1.080-1.672, p = 0.008) as well as for an interaction of sex with this effect (p = 0.0150). The RADIANT/WTCCC2 study was the only study showing such sex × genotype interaction on depression. A more detailed description of this association is given in the Supplemental Information section. Finally, when combining the corrected estimate for the genotypic effect of AA on depression in the RADIANT/WTCCC2 study with the effects in the previous studies, we arrive at an estimate of an OR = 1.398 (95% CI 1.254–1.557) with a combined two-sided p value of 1.41e-09 (Figure 3). Considering only the replication studies (thus excluding MARS), we have an estimate of 1.315 for the OR (95% CI 1.172–1.477) with a two-sided p value of 3.19e-06. While the association with major depression and depressive symptoms thus was consistent in samples across different ethnicities, this did not hold true for incident late-life depression. The association did not replicate in the Rotterdam study (n = 3512) (Hofman et al., 2007Hofman A. Breteler M.M. van Duijn C.M. Krestin G.P. Pols H.A. Stricker B.H. Tiemeier H. Uitterlinden A.G. Vingerling J.R. Witteman J.C. The Rotterdam Study: Objectives and design update.Eur. J. Epidemiol. 2007; 22: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), where subjects older than 55 years of age and free of dementia were screened with the CES-D at baseline and two follow-up time points (Luijendijk et al., 2008Luijendijk H.J. van den Berg J.F. Dekker M.J. van Tuijl H.R. Otte W. Smit F. Hofman A. Stricker B.H. Tiemeier H. Incidence and recurrence of late-life depression.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2008; 65: 1394-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A case-control analysis was performed by comparing subjects who developed depressive disorders and depressive syndromes at follow up time points (n = 438) with individuals without clinically relevant depressive symptoms (n = 3074) (mean age ± standard deviation [SD] of cases: 72.7 ± 7.4 years and controls: 73.9 ± 8.3 years). None of the investigated SNPs reached significant association. The average age of 72 years at which the index depressive episode in the Rotterdam sample was diagnosed is substantially older than the average age in the combined German discovery sample and recurrent depression sample (50.4 ± 13.9 years), the Dutch ERF sample (48.7 ± 15.0 years), and the African-American sample (39.3 ± 13.7 years). In fact, in the other samples significant associations with rs1545843 were only observed when individuals ≤ 55 years were selected but not in the older age group. A series of studies indicate that late-life depression is pathophysiologically distinct from earlier onset MD being more strongly related to vascular disease and future cognitive impairment (Alexopoulos, 2006Alexopoulos G.S. The vascular depression hypothesis: 10 years later.Biol. Psychiatry. 2006; 60: 1304-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In summary, as shown in the forest plot in Figure 3, the initial GWAS revealed a SNP (rs1545843) on chr12q21.31 to be associated with MD with experiment-wide significance. This could be confirmed in a meta-analysis across six additional independent samples, including one sample of African-American heritage, with the recessive model of rs1545843 reaching genome-wide significance. The associated SNP lies within a region of SNPs in moderate LD that span a gene desert of about 450 kb in size on 12q21.31 mapping neither to any annotated gene nor to predicted human mRNAs with the exception of some small human expressed sequence tags (EST, Figure 1A and Table S1). The closest RefSeq annotated gene is SLC6A15 (NM_182767), which ends 287 kb further distal to the region of association. It belongs to the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) gene family and codes for a sodium-dependent branched-chain amino acid transporter (Bröer, 2006Bröer S. The SLC6 orphans are forming a family of amino acid transporters.Neurochem. Int. 2006; 48: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SLC6A15 gene expression is highest in the human brain as well as the brain of other vertebrate species (UniGene, 2009UniGene.

In rodents and humans, SLC6A15 expression has been shown to be restricted to neurons with strong expression in many brain regions including the hippocampus (Farmer et al., 2000Farmer M.K.

In a separate study, additional biophysical characterization was performed to arrange these aggregates into a classification system (Joubert, M. K., Luo, Q., Nashed-Samuel, Y., Wypych, J., and Narhi, L. O. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 25118–25133). Here, we report that different aggregates possessed different types and levels of chemical modification. For chemically treated samples, metal-catalyzed oxidation using copper showed site-specific oxidation of Met246, His304, and His427 in the Fc portion of the antibody, which might be attributed to a putative copper-binding site. For the hydrogen peroxide-treated sample, in contrast, four solvent-exposed Met residues in the Fc portion were completely oxidized. Met and/or Trp oxidation was observed in the mechanically stressed samples, which is in agreement with the proposed model of protein interaction at the air-liquid interface. Heat treatment resulted in significant deamidation but almost no oxidation, which is consistent with thermally induced aggregates being generated by a different pathway, primarily by perturbing conformational stability. These results demonstrate that chemical modifications are present in protein aggregates; furthermore, the type, locations, and severity of the modifications depend on the specific conditions that generated the aggregates.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibodies represent a rapidly growing drug class in the biopharmaceutical industry for the treatment and prevention of disease (1Brekke O.H. Sandlie I. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 2Schrama D. Reisfeld R.A. Becker J.C. Nat. Rev.

Although antibodies are relatively stable, they can undergo a variety of degradations during manufacturing, formulation, and storage. Protein aggregates, one of the most common degradants in the preparation of high concentration protein therapeutics, have been proposed to cause adverse effects, such as reduced efficacy and immunological reactions (4Braun A. Kwee L. Labow M.A. Alsenz J. Pharm. Res. 1997; 14: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 5Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G.

Pediatr. 1996; 35: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although direct evidence supporting these effects in humans is not currently available. It is therefore very important to characterize the biophysical and biochemical properties of aggregates to better assess their safety and efficacy. It is also very important to understand the underlying mechanisms of protein aggregation, which requires thorough characterization of different aggregate species. Chemical modifications may play a role in protein aggregation (8Mahler H.C. Friess W. Grauschopf U. Kiese S. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 2909-2934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), which includes reactions such as isomerization, deamidation, oxidation, and peptide bond cleavage (8Mahler H.C. Friess W. Grauschopf U. Kiese S. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 2909-2934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Z. Pan H. Chen X. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2009; 28: 147-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Deamidation can cause structurally and biologically important alterations in peptides and proteins through the introduction of unfavorable negative charge (10Huang L. Lu J. Wroblewski V.J. Beals J.M. Riggin R.M. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Flynn G.C. Biologicals. 2009; 37: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of a specific Asn to deamidation is a function of neighboring amino acids, tertiary structure, and solution conditions, including pH, temperature, and ionic strength (11Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12409-12413Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 12Kosky A.A. Razzaq U.O. Treuheit M.J. Brems D.N. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2519-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The primary sequence is one of the main contributions to deamidation rates with the amino acid residues adjacent to Asn being especially significant. Gly in the C-terminal position in model proteins has been found to result in the most deamidation of Asn (10Huang L. Lu J. Wroblewski V.J. Beals J.M. Riggin R.M. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Oxidation is one of the major degradation pathways for protein therapeutics under stress conditions (15Men L. Wang Y. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Pan H. Chen K. Chu L. Kinderman F. Apostol I. Huang G.

Cys, Met, Trp, and His are all prone to oxidation. The thiol group in the exposed Cys residues is a highly reactive functional group (19Ji J.A. Zhang B. Cheng W. Wang Y.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 4485-4500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Oxidation reactions can be promoted by light exposure, transition metals, peroxide from or induced by excipients, or simply the presence of oxygen during the manufacturing and storage process (20Bee J.S.

Metal-catalyzed oxidation occurs in the presence of oxygen, transition metals (iron and copper, in particular) (24Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15514-15525Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and a reducing agent that can convert oxygen to a reactive oxygen species (O2⋅¯ or OH·) and the transition metal to its reduced form (25Lim J. Vachet R.W. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A unique feature observed during the metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins is that only a few amino acid residues located in close proximity to each other are modified (25Lim J. Vachet R.W. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Li S. Nguyen T.H. Schöneich C. Borchardt R.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9019-9029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This site specificity is dependent on the metal-binding site where the reactive oxygen species are generated and also the half-life of reactive oxygen species. The reactive oxygen species are hindered from diffusing into the surrounding medium because they react quickly with amino acid residues near the site of generation (26Li S. Nguyen T.H. Schöneich C. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5762-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Zhao F. Ghezzo-Schöneich E. Aced G.I. Hong J. Milby T. Schöneich C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 25118-25133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we applied various stress conditions to generate different populations of IgG2 aggregates. These stresses varied from very mild to harsh and were chosen as accelerated conditions based on the types of stress that might be encountered during the manufacturing process and to result in a wide range of different aggregate populations. The stress conditions used to generate IgG2 aggregates can also induce chemical modifications in proteins, and indeed, chemical modification could contribute to aggregation of the protein. Therefore, it is essential to determine whether chemical modifications are present in these different aggregate types, which can provide clues as to the underlying mechanism of aggregate formation and the potential impact of chemical modifications on specific characteristics of the aggregates. In this study, we use LC-MS/MS to characterize the chemical modifications of the aggregates of an IgG2 formed under different conditions, including mechanical, chemical, and thermal stress treatment. The recombinant IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb1) used in this study was produced at Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA) and consisted of two human γ HCs and two human κ LCs. The antibody was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and highly purified using well established chromatographic procedures developed at Amgen (29Shukla A.A. Hubbard B. Tressel T. Guhan S. Low D.J. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2007; 848: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The Tm of the mAb1 was assessed using differential scanning calorimetry, and the sample in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, showed a Tm at ∼74.2 °C. Trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C (Glu-C) were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and urea were obtained from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Dithiothreitol, iodoacetic acid sodium salt, ascorbic acid, EDTA, and Tris base were obtained from Sigma. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was from Pierce. NAPTM-5 columns were from GE Healthcare. As described in the accompanying article (28Joubert M.K. Luo Q. Nashed-Samuel Y. Wypych J. Narhi L.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25118-25133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), mAb1 aggregates were generated under various conditions. Briefly, for syringe stress, the protein samples were pumped 50 times through a disposable 18-gauge × 1.5-inch needle (VWR Scientific) attached to either a 3-ml disposable syringe containing silicone oil (Fisher) (syringe-so+), or through a Daikyo Crystal Zenith syringe that is silicone oil-free (West Pharmaceutical Services) (syringe-so−). For stirring stress, 2 ml of the protein sample was stirred with a 6 × 6-mm Teflon stir bar at ∼700 rpm in a glass vial capped and placed vertically on a magnetic stir plate over 20 h (stir-20h) or for 3 days (stir-3d). For thermal stress, the protein solution (1 mg/ml) was either incubated at 90 °C overnight (90C) or diluted to 1 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate, pH 8.5, followed by incubation at 65 °C for 1 h (65C/pH 8.5). For hydrogen peroxide oxidation, 0.1% H2O2 was added to the protein, and the solution was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C and quenched with 80 mm Met aqueous solution. For metal-catalyzed oxidation, protein solution (1 mg/ml) was oxidized with 5 mm CuSO4 and 4 mm ascorbic acid overnight at 37 °C and then the reaction was quenched with 5 mm EDTA. After quenching, H2O2 and metal samples were dialyzed overnight into 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0. To compare the chemical modifications in supernatant and pellet fractions, the total stressed samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant and pellet were separated by carefully removing the supernatant using a pipette. The supernatant fractions of the stressed samples were subjected to SE-HPLC analysis. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a binary pump was equipped with a UV detector and an autosampler. The proteins were injected onto a Tosoh Bioscience TSK-Gel G3000SWxl column (7.8 × 300 mm, 5-μm particles) operated at room temperature. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the eluted proteins were monitored by UV absorption (280 nm wavelength). The mobile phase contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, 250 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.8. mAb1 total stressed samples and their supernatant and pellet fractions were dissolved in GdnHCl and 0.1 m Tris buffer to achieve a final concentration of 6.5 m GdnHCl. Reduction was conducted with 10 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration), followed by alkylation with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. NAPTM-5 columns were then used to exchange the reduced and alkylated samples into 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The proteolytic enzyme (trypsin or Glu-C) was added to the samples of the reduced and alkylated protein to achieve a protein:enzyme ratio of ∼20:1 (w/w) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Met was added (∼12 mm final concentration) to the sample to inhibit method-induced oxidation. The mixture was acidified with 5% TFA to quench the digestion. Two complementary peptide maps, generated by trypsin and Glu-C, were performed to characterize the chemical modifications in the stressed samples. The trypsin peptide map was employed as the primary map. A complementary Glu-C peptide map was performed to obtain full sequence coverage.

The antibody digests were separated using a RP-HPLC column (Phenomenex Jupiter C5, 2 × 250 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size), with the column temperature maintained at 50 °C. The mobile phase A was 0.1% (v/v) TFA in water, and the mobile phase B was 0.1% TFA and 90% acetonitrile in water. A gradient (hold at 2% B for 5 min, 2–22% B for 25 min, and then 22–42% B within 95 min) was used to separate the digested peptides at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The eluted peptides were monitored by both UV absorption (214 nm wavelength) and mass spectrometry. The solvent peaks were diverted to the waste before the flow entered the ESI source. The ESI source voltage of the LTQ was set at 4.5 kV and the capillary temperature at 275 °C. For MS experiments, mass spectra were acquired from 300 to 2000 m/z in the positive mode, followed by a data-dependent ultra zoom scan to determine the charge state of the most intense ion and a MS/MS scan to identify the sequence of the peptide precursor ion. In the MS/MS scan, the precursor ions were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID) with 35% relative collision energy. Peptides were identified using Mass Analyzer (30Zhang Z. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 6374-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), an in-house developed software, which correlates the experimental tandem mass spectra against the theoretical tandem mass spectra generated of known peptide sequences.

A molecular model was generated of the mAb1 variable domain, combining framework and complementarity determining region (CDR) structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The Antibody Modeler component of the MOE software was used to build the model. The framework structure was chosen from the PDB based on percent of amino acid identity and conservation, a structure rating factor, and the combination of the light chain variable domain and heavy chain variable domain scores. CDR structures were first limited by length and then chosen based on percent identity and conservation, with structural outliers being removed. The final model was structurally refined and energy-minimized with MMFF94 force field parameters and checked for allowed Ramachandran ϕ-ψ angles, bond angles and lengths, and conserved positive ϕ angles (31Halgren T.A.

Solvent accessibility calculations were performed by MOE software, using a 1.4-Å solvent radius consistent with H2O, on the homology-derived computational molecular model for the variable domain, PDB code 2QSC for constant region one of the heavy chain domain, and PDB code 1T89 for the Fc region. The theoretical maximum solvent accessibility was calculated on the Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Gly sequence, where Xaa-Xaa-Xaa is the residue of interest, extracting the three residues and their actual dihedral angles. The percentage of solvent accessibility was calculated by dividing the actual solvent accessibility in the context of the entire structure by the theoretical maximum in its particular environment. Individual models and structures for separate domains were chosen based on sequence homology for the most accurate data. Full-length human antibody IgG1 b12, PDB entry 1HZH (34Saphire E.O.

As described in the accompanying article (28Joubert M.K. Luo Q. Nashed-Samuel Y. Wypych J. Narhi L.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25118-25133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), various stress conditions were used to generate aggregates of mAb1. Table 1 shows how sample treatment results in different aggregates, which were thoroughly biochemically characterized in this study. The supernatant fractions of the stressed samples were evaluated by SE-HPLC to quantify the amount of monomer, oligomers, and fragments. A TSK-Gel G3000SWxl column, which provides a calibration range of 10,000–500,000 for globular proteins, was used for the analysis such that oligomers and fragments can be clearly resolved from the monomers. Oligomers were detected in the stir-20h (11.1 ± 0.7%) and 65C/pH 8.5 (3.3 ± 0.4%) samples. Fragments were only detected in the 65C/pH 8.5 (1.1 ± 0.3%) and 90C (100.0 ± 0.0%) samples, indicating that peptide bond cleavage occurred under the chosen thermal stress conditions. For untreated, syringe-so−, syringe-so+, and H2O2-treated samples, very low amounts of oligomers (0.4 ± 0.1%), but no fragments, were detected. The stir-3d sample was not characterized because the amounts of protein remaining in the supernatant fraction were below the detection limit of SE-HPLC. Because of the interference of the UV absorbance of copper, the supernatant fraction of the metal-stressed sample was not analyzed by SE-HPLC.TABLE 1The analyzed mAb1 aggregates stressed under different conditionsStress treatmentaFor detailed stress conditions see our accompanying article (28).Mechanical stressSyringe-so−Syringe-so+Stir-20hStir-3dChemical treatmentMetalH2O2Thermal stress65 °C/pH 8.590 °Ca For detailed stress conditions see our accompanying article (28Joubert M.K.

Open table in a new tab In this study, we focused on the syringe- and stirring-stressed samples as those mimic the “real life” mechanical stresses that biopharmaceuticals may experience during manufacturing and injection. No oxidation of Cys residues was detected in this study, indicating that the intramolecule disulfide bonds might be completely formed and not affected by the stress treatments used in this study. mAb1 contains six Met, nine Trp, and eight His residues on each of the heavy chains and three Trp and three His residues on each of the light chains. Among them, one Met (Met34 in the Fab of the heavy chain), two Trp (Trp104 in the Fab of the heavy chain and Trp98 in the Fab of the light chain), and one His (His94 in the Fab of the light chain) are located in the CDR of mAb1, as highlighted in Fig. 1. The locations of all the Met (red), Trp (blue), and His (charcoal) residues of the mAb1 as well as their corresponding tryptic peptides containing the labile amino acids are shown in Fig. 1. Oxidation at Met, Trp, and His sites was characterized through peptide mapping. The diluted samples before stress treatment were used as negative controls. Chemical modifications in the total stressed samples as well as the supernatant and pellet fractions were calculated by comparing the peak area under the SIC of the modified and unmodified peptides in a single LC/MS analysis. Thus, the protein concentration in pellet and supernatant should not affect the results. As an example, six Met-containing peptides, H3 (Met34), H9 (Met82), H20 (Met246), H32–33 (Met352), H36 (Met391), and H39 (Met422) were identified by MS/MS in the peptide map of the negative control sample (top panel in Fig. 2), and no modified forms of the peptides were detected. The fact that no oxidation was detected in the control suggests that the analytical process does not create oxidation artifacts. In the sample that was stirred for 20 h, six new peptides with a mass increase of 16 Da were observed in the peptide map of the total stressed sample. The MS/MS analysis revealed that the +16-Da species are the oxidized forms, with Met being oxidized to the sulfoxide form (bottom trace in Fig. 2). Oxidized Met is more polar and less hydrophobic, which leads to decreased retention relative to the corresponding parent peptides on the RP-HPLC column. For certain peptides containing Met residues, the oxidized products resolved sufficiently from the parent counterparts and other unrelated peptides such that the UV signal could be used to quantify the levels of oxidation. Fig. 3 shows a region of the peptide map of the total unfractionated stir-20h sample and focuses on the profile changes occurring for the Met34-containing peptide H3. UV and SIC traces are provided for comparison. Met34 was oxidized at 12.5% as measured using UV integration, which is consistent with the value (11.4%) obtained by using the SIC approach. Because the SIC approach was in good agreement with the UV-based quantitation (14Liu Y.D. van Enk J.Z. Flynn G.C. Biologicals. 2009; 37: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it was used to quantify chemical modifications at all labile amino acid residues, which allowed quantitation of modifications that were not sufficiently resolved from other peptides in the UV chromatogram or for which the modification level was too low to be quantified by UV. The modifications in the total stressed samples as well as the supernatant and pellet fractions were calculated by comparing the peak area under the SIC of the modified and unmodified peptides in a single LC/MS analysis. Thus, the protein concentration in pellet and supernatant should not affect the results.FIGURE 2Trypsin peptide maps of untreated and mechanically stressed mAb1 by mild stirring (stir-20h).

Human IgG1 and IgG2 sequences are highly conserved in the Fc domain, with ∼94% sequence identity. Because the overall tertiary fold in this region is likely to be very similar as well, the human IgG1 Fc structure could serve as a reasonable surrogate for the human IgG2 Fc structure. The calculated solvent accessibility reflects the percent of the residue that is on the surface of the folded protein based on the molecular model. Residues that are more surface-exposed are expected to be more available for oxidation and other chemical modifications. The SAS of the Met residues in the IgG2 Fc portion, Met246, Met352, and Met422, were calculated from the crystal structure of the IgG1 Fc, and the levels are 30, 33, and 7%, respectively. Met391, which is also in the Fc portion of IgG2, corresponds to Val397 in the IgG1 structure, and the SAS level of Val397 in the IgG1 structure is 19%. The SAS of the two Met residues in the IgG2 Fab portion, Met34 and Met82, are calculated based on the homology model built on structures in the PDB, and they are completely buried in the molecule. The SAS of the Trp residues are calculated in the same way, and all five modified out of a total of twelve Trp residues show low solvent accessibility (1–8%).TABLE 2Met and Trp oxidation (%) in mechanically stressed mAb1 samplesUntreatedSyringe-so+Syringe-so−Stir-20hStir-3dSASaSAS is of the modified amino acid residue.TotalPelletSupernatantTotalPelletSupernatantTotalPelletSupernatantTotalPelletSupernatant%Met34 (HC)bHC means heavy chain.–c– means not detected.–17.1––9.1–11.412.710.541.035.540.3<0.1Met82 (HC)––18.0––––15.011.412.236.437.733.4<0.1Met246 (H"
https://openalex.org/W1997078443,"In cerebral cortex there is a developmental switch from NR2B- to NR2A-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) driven by activity and sensory experience. This subunit switch alters NMDAR function, influences synaptic plasticity, and its dysregulation is associated with neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms driving the subunit switch are not known. Here, we show in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons that the NR2B to NR2A switch driven acutely by activity requires activation of NMDARs and mGluR5, involves PLC, Ca(2+) release from IP(3)R-dependent stores, and PKC activity. In mGluR5 knockout mice the developmental NR2B-NR2A switch in CA1 is deficient. Moreover, in visual cortex of mGluR5 knockout mice, the NR2B-NR2A switch evoked in vivo by visual experience is absent. Thus, we establish that mGluR5 and NMDARs are required for the activity-dependent NR2B-NR2A switch and play a critical role in experience-dependent regulation of NMDAR subunit composition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2008456025,"Two families of Ca(2+)-binding proteins have been proposed as Ca(2+) sensors for spontaneous release: synaptotagmins and Doc2s, with the intriguing possibility that Doc2s may represent high-affinity Ca(2+) sensors that are activated by deletion of synaptotagmins, thereby accounting for the increased spontaneous release in synaptotagmin-deficient synapses. Here, we use an shRNA-dependent quadruple knockdown of all four Ca(2+)-binding proteins of the Doc2 family to confirm that Doc2-deficient synapses exhibit a marked decrease in the frequency of spontaneous release events. Knockdown of Doc2s in synaptotagmin-1-deficient synapses, however, failed to reduce either the increased spontaneous release or the decreased evoked release of these synapses, suggesting that Doc2s do not constitute Ca(2+) sensors for asynchronous release. Moreover, rescue experiments revealed that the decrease in spontaneous release induced by the Doc2 knockdown in wild-type synapses is fully reversed by mutant Doc2B lacking Ca(2+)-binding sites. Thus, our data suggest that Doc2s are modulators of spontaneous synaptic transmission that act by a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism."

Optimizing fMRI protocols yields additional face areas in macaque temporal lobe Macaques possess potential FFA and OFA homologs Faces activate MTL under passive viewing The face-selective network is nearly identical in awake and anesthetized monkeys Face recognition is a critically important cognitive ability for primates, who often communicate with facial expressions and gaze directions and use these cues to determine appropriate behavioral responses. The importance of face processing for social function is illustrated by the effects of prosopagnosia in humans, which can be debilitating (Damasio et al., 1982Damasio A.R. Damasio H. Van Hoesen G.W. Prosopagnosia: Anatomic basis and behavioral mechanisms.Neurology. 1982; 32: 331-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the importance of faces, primates have an extensive network of brain areas devoted to face processing (Haxby et al., 2000Haxby J.V. Hoffman E.A. Gobbini M.I.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), lesion studies, and electrophysiological studies in humans and monkeys have discovered numerous face-processing areas. In electrophysiological studies in macaques, neurons responding to facial expressions and gaze direction were found in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) (De Souza et al., 2005De Souza W.C. Eifuku S.

USA. 2008; 105: 19514-19519Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) show correspondence between face-selective activation in monkeys and humans, but substantial differences remain. Differences are particularly pronounced in ventral temporal areas: for instance, little face selectivity has been found in the ventral temporal lobe in macaques and homologs of the FFA or occipital face area (OFA) have not yet been identified. To date, the degree of overall similarity in face-processing areas between humans and macaques is not clear. Although it is entirely possible that this lack of similarity between humans and macaques is due to species differences, a factor that complicates the question is that fMRI of the temporal lobe is problematic because of the large susceptibility artifacts from the ear canal. In addition, in humans the anterior temporal lobe is often not included in the imaging volume, while the use of surface coils in macaque fMRI can lead to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in ventral areas that are furthest away from the coil. Thus, it is likely that the discrepancy arises because face-selective areas have been missed in humans, macaques, or in both species. In our earlier work, we showed that by using high-field spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals can be obtained with high sensitivity in ventral temporal areas despite the presence of susceptibility gradients from the ear canal and that SE-based fMRI outperforms gradient echo (GE) fMRI in these regions (Goense et al., 2008Goense J.B.M.

Here, our goal was to map the face-selective network in macaques, particularly in the ventral temporal lobe. As stimuli we used monkey faces with different views, expressions, and gaze directions to activate areas that respond to identity as well as areas that respond to social cues like facial expression. Faces were contrasted against fruit, houses, and fractals. In addition, we repeated the experiment in anesthetized monkeys to eliminate possible confounding effects of motion and to identify those areas that depend on awake processing. We found face-selective patches in STS, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala in agreement with earlier fMRI studies in the macaque (Logothetis et al., 1999Logothetis N.K. Guggenberger H. Peled S. Pauls J. Functional imaging of the monkey brain.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Pinsk et al., 2005Pinsk M.A. DeSimone K. Moore T. Gross C.G. Kastner S.

Patches of face-selective cortex in the macaque frontal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). But we also found face selectivity in several additional locations: ventral V4, anterior TE, and the parahippocampal cortex in the ventral temporal lobe and the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The face-selective pattern was largely similar in awake and anesthetized monkeys, suggesting that most of this network is not dependent on the awake state of the animal. Our results show that the face-processing network in the macaque brain is more extensive than reported previously and includes several additional areas in MTL and the ventral temporal cortex, including potential FFA homologs. fMRI data from two awake and three anesthetized monkeys were acquired while the animals were shown visual stimuli belonging to different categories (faces, fruit, fractals, and houses for awake animals and faces and fruit for anesthetized animals). Data were acquired at 7T by using a vertical primate scanner (see Goense et al., 2008Goense J.B.M. Ku S.P. Merkle H. Tolias A.S. Logothetis N.K. fMRI of the temporal lobe of the awake monkey at 7 T.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar for technical details). Figure 1 shows examples of the stimuli (Figure 1A) and the timing of the behavioral paradigm used for awake monkeys (Figures 1B and 1C). We used an SE-based functional imaging protocol that was optimized to perform fMRI in the ventral temporal lobe and was previously shown not to suffer from signal loss near the ear canal (Goense et al., 2008Goense J.B.M. Ku S.P. Merkle H. Tolias A.S. Logothetis N.K. fMRI of the temporal lobe of the awake monkey at 7 T.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Figures 1D–1G show that by using this protocol we were able to reliably record functional activation in the ventral temporal lobe. Figures 1E–1G show visually induced functional activation in an awake animal in response to static images. Visual responses were found in the early visual cortex (V1–V4) and in a large portion of the temporal cortex, including the STS and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). In addition, the ventral temporal cortex was also clearly activated (Figure 1G), including ventral TE and the parahippocampal region (area TF). The pattern of visually elicited activation agrees well with the known visual areas based on electrophysiological and anatomical data (Gattass et al., 2005Gattass R. Nascimento-Silva S. Soares J.G.

Sci. 2005; 360: 709-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We examined face-selective areas in the STS and ITG of awake monkeys (Figure 2) with the purpose of comparing the functional activation measured with the high-field SE-BOLD method to data reported in the literature with the more common GE-BOLD method (Pinsk et al., 2005Pinsk M.A. DeSimone K. Moore T. Gross C.G. Kastner S. Representations of faces and body parts in macaque temporal cortex: A functional MRI study.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 6996-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the contrast agent-based cerebral blood volume (CBV) method (Tsao et al., 2003Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Knutsen T.A. Mandeville J.B. Tootell R.B. Faces and objects in macaque cerebral cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, Tsao et al., 2008aTsao D.Y. Moeller S.

The comparison of faces versus the other three object categories yielded significant bilateral face-selective BOLD activation in the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the STS (Figure 2 and Figure S1, available online). All animals showed strong and extensive face-selective activation in the STS (Table 1) in agreement with previous studies in macaques (Logothetis et al., 1999Logothetis N.K. Guggenberger H. Peled S.

Although in cases of strong activation the STS middle patch appeared to be contiguous, single-subject analysis showed that in several animals it actually consisted of two separate patches. Figures 2E and 2F show the time courses of the signals in the anterior and middle face patches in the STS of monkey B04. The face patches showed significantly higher responses to faces than to the other categories, but they showed nonzero responses to the other object categories. These results indicate that the face areas in the STS do not exclusively respond to faces, consistent with previous literature in humans and monkeys (Bell et al., 2009Bell A.H. Hadj-Bouziane F.

Because STS neurons respond selectively to different categories, including faces and other objects (Logothetis and Sheinberg, 1996Logothetis N.K. Sheinberg D.L. Visual object recognition.Annu. Rev.

By using the same criteria as for face-selective regions, we found that fruit evoked higher BOLD responses than the other categories in several brain regions across all subjects (Figure 3 and Table S1). Fruit-selective activation was found in V3, the posterior STS (TEO), and anterior STS (IPa). Fruit-selective activation in the STS was located at AP 12 to 20 and AP –5 to –1, just posterior to the face-selective patches. The distribution of house- and fractal-selective voxels was not consistent across animals, which suggests that only biologically relevant objects such as faces and fruit evoke sufficiently strong and clustered functional activation in the monkey temporal cortex.Table 1Face-Selective Areas in Awake and Anesthetized MonkeysAwakeAnesthetizedB04G03N08L04C06Known Face AreasAMTS (TEav)aAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.RBABABABAaSTSaAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.BABALBABAmSTSaAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.BABABABABAAmygdalaBALBA––OF∗∗LBABAPF∗∗BABABAUnknown Face AreasvV4aAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.LBABABARmTFaAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.BARBALBAEntorhinal cortexaAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.RLRBABAaInsula (or LS)aAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.BABALBALpCingulate (area 23/24)aAreas where face-selective activity was found in all animals.BABABABABAvTE (TEpd)bAn area was activated in four out of five monkeys.RLBAL–TGabAn area was activated in four out of five monkeys.RLBABA–pInsulabAn area was activated in four out of five monkeys.RRRR–aCingulate (area 32)bAn area was activated in four out of five monkeys.∗BABABABAaHippocampusBABAR––mHippocampusBABAL––Claustrum∗∗BABALvaTE (TEad)L–RBA–Included in the table are all areas that showed significantly higher responses to faces than to the other categories in at least three monkeys (p < 0.001 uncorrected; cluster-level ≥ 5 voxels).

Although many electrophysiological studies have shown face- and object-selective cells in the anterior temporal pole in macaques (i.e., area TGa, the area around the anterior medial temporal sulcus [AMTS], and the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices; Nakamura and Kubota, 1996Nakamura K.

This is probably due to signal loss caused by the strong susceptibility gradients in the ventral temporal lobe. The susceptibility artifacts from the ear canal can potentially obscure face-selective areas in the ventral temporal lobe in both humans and monkeys. Hence, a goal of the present study was to examine whether there are possibly additional face-selective areas in this region. By using our SE fMRI protocol, we found multiple face-selective areas in the ventral temporal cortex and MTL in both awake monkeys (Figure 4 and Figure S2). We considered an area face selective if it was significantly activated in four or all five animals (see Table 1); although activation was often bilateral, bilateral activation was not required for inclusion. We found face-selective areas around the AMTS (labeled AMTS) at AP 17–21 (Figure 4B), which for four animals was localized in TEav, and for one at the border of TEav and TEad. Furthermore, a face-selective area was found in anterior ventral TE (AP 13–21) corresponding to TEad and another patch was found in the most anterior part of the temporal cortex, area TGa (Table 1). In addition, we also observed face-selective activation in ventral V4 near TF (Figure 4C, Figures S2C and S5, and Table 1), and a face-selective area located in the parahippocampal cortex (area TF) at AP 2–10 (Figure 4D, Figures S2D and S5, and Table 1). The location and size of the latter two activated areas are given in Table S2. Our results indicate that the ventral temporal cortex contains multiple additional face-selective patches. Although the monkeys were only required to fixate, we found face-selective activation in the medial temporal lobe in the entorhinal cortex (Figure 4E and Figure S2E) and two patches in the hippocampus (anterior and posterior) (Figure 4G and Figure S2G), areas usually associated with memory (Squire et al., 2004Squire L.R. Stark C.E. Clark R.E. The medial temporal lobe.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Face-selective activation was also identified in the amygdalae in both awake monkeys (Figure 4F and Figure S2F) in agreement with previous fMRI and neurophysiology studies (Hadj-Bouziane et al., 2008Hadj-Bouziane F. Bell A.H. Knusten T.A. Ungerleider L.G. Tootell R.B. Perception of emotional expressions is independent of face selectivity in monkey inferior temporal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurons in the amygdala of the monkey with responses selective for faces.Behav. Brain Res. 1985; 15: 159-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Outside the temporal lobe, face-selective patches were found in the anterior insula (Figure 4H and Figure S2H) and posterior cingulate cortex (Figure 4I and Figure S2I). Three monkeys were scanned anesthetized, with the goal of identifying whether activation of these face-selective areas depends on processes that require the animal to be awake, like processes involving attention or memory. Because even minor animal motion can potentially lead to artifactual activation (Goense et al., 2010Goense J.B.M. Whittingstall K. Logothetis N.K. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of awake behaving macaques.Methods. 2010; 50: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), anesthetized experiments have an additional advantage in that they provide a control, which allowed us to verify that areas found in awake monkeys were not contaminated by motion artifacts. Figure 5 shows that face-selective responses in most areas were retained under anesthesia and the pattern of activity was largely similar for awake and anesthetized animals. Figure S3 shows the other two anesthetized animals and Table 1 provides a summary of the areas that were activated in the two awake and three anesthetized monkeys. Face-selective functional activity was preserved under anesthesia in the STS (Figure S4), in the ventral temporal lobe, around the AMTS, and i"

IL-6 expression can be regulated at both a transcriptional and a post-transcriptional level. We used a combination of bioinformatics and experimental techniques to demonstrate that the miR-365 is a direct negative regulator of IL-6. Overexpression of miR-365 mimics decreased activity of a luciferase reporter containing the IL-6 3′-UTR and led to repression of IL-6 protein. In contrast, ectopic expression of a miR-365 inhibitor elevated IL-6 expression. The negative regulation of miR-365 was strictly dependent on a microRNA binding element in the 3′-UTR of IL-6 mRNA. Deletion mutant analysis of the miR-365 promoter showed that two transcription factors, Sp1 and NF-κB, are essential for the transcriptional regulation of miR-365. We also demonstrate that the MAPK/ERK pathway contributes to the regulation of miR-365. Furthermore, miR-365 exhibited a greater negative regulatory effect on IL-6 than hsa-let-7a, a previously identified microRNA negatively regulating IL-6.

IntroductionMicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) 3The abbreviations used are: miRNAsmicroRNAMREmiRNA recognition elementsTSStranscription start site. are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (1Ambros V. Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (8921) Google Scholar). In mammals, miRNAs are initially transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and the primary miRNA transcripts are sequentially cut by RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer (2Lee Y. Jeon K. Lee J.T. Kim S. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4663-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 3Yi R. Qin Y. Macara I.G. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3011-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). The resulting ∼23-nucleotide double-stranded mature miRNA molecules load into RNA-induced silencing complexes (4Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Rådmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3925) Google Scholar, 5Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29004) Google Scholar), where they act to repress mRNA translation or reduce mRNA stability by interacting with miRNA recognition elements (MRE) within 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of target genes (6Kiriakidou M. Nelson P.T. Kouranov A. Fitziev P. Bouyioukos C. Mourelatos Z. Hatzigeorgiou A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The specificity of miRNAs is thought to be primarily mediated by residues 2–8 at the 5′ end of miRNA, also known as the seed region (7Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar).Growing evidence exists indicating that miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of inflammation. For example, miR-146a has been characterized as a negative regulator of the inflammatory response by targeting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor 6 (8Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3454) Google Scholar). Xiao et al. (9Xiao B. Liu Z. Li B.S. Tang B. Li W. Guo G. Shi Y. Wang F. Wu Y. Tong W.D. Guo H. Mao X.H. Zou Q.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2009; 200: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) reported that miR-155 is involved in negative regulation of Heliobacter pylori-induced inflammation, and miR-155 was further identified as targeting myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) (10Tang B. Xiao B. Liu Z. Li N. Zhu E.D. Li B.S. Xie Q.H. Zhuang Y. Zou Q.M. Mao X.H. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). miRNAs regulate inflammation not only by targeting adapter proteins involved in the signaling pathway but also inflammatory mediators. Many interleukins have been found to be targets of miRNAs. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been identified as the target of hsa-miR-106a (11Sharma A. Kumar M. Aich J. Hariharan M. Brahmachari S.K. Agrawal A. Ghosh B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5761-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-7 up-regulate IL-10 and IL-6 levels in murine macrophages and human myelomonocytic cells (12Qin Z. Kearney P. Plaisance K. Parsons C.H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2010; 87: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). miR-466l elevates IL-10 expression by preventing IL-10 mRNA degradation (13Ma F. Liu X. Li D. Wang P. Li N. Lu L. Cao X. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 6053-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). IL-13, a cytokine essential for expression for allergic lung disease, was recently found to be regulated by mmu-let-7a (14Polikepahad S. Knight J.M. Naghavi A.O. Oplt T. Creighton C.J. Shaw C.

Immunol. 2009; 182: 5088-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of the immune response, hematopoiesis, and inflammation (16Akira S. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). It was previously considered to be a regulator of acute-phase responses and a lymphocyte-stimulatory factor (17Hirano T. Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol.

Immunol. 2005; 23: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). However, recent advances have documented a series of IL-6 activities that are critical for resolving innate immunity and promoting acquired immunity (20Jones S.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3463-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). IL-6 expression can be regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (21Rambaldi A. Bettoni S. Rossi V. Tini M.L. Giudici G. Rizzo V. Bassan R. Mantovani A. Barbui T. Biondi A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 83: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Clark A. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but whether and how IL-6 is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by miRNA has so far been incompletely understood.In this study we establish that miR-365 is a novel miRNA regulator of human IL-6. miR-365 regulates the expression of IL-6 by classic interaction with the MRE in the 3′-UTR of IL-6 and further represses mRNA translation, although mRNA degradation is not involved. We also investigated the transcriptional regulation mechanism of miR-365.DISCUSSIONIn this study we established that miR-365 is a direct negative regulator of IL-6. We found that IL-6 protein expression is modulated by miR-365, and this regulatory effect is driven by miR-365 through conserved seed matches within the 3′-UTR of IL-6. The stability of IL-6 mRNA is not affected by miR-365, and it appears regulation of the target gene may be achieved by repressing mRNA translation. We further showed that the promoter region of miR-365 possesses several consensus Sp1 and NF-κB binding sites, that overexpression of NF-κB p65 or Sp1 leads to a significant up-regulation of miR-365 transcription, and co-expression of Sp1 and NF-κB p65 is required for the maximal induction of miR-365.We provide multiple pieces of evidence to identify miR-365 as a regulator of IL-6. 1) A miR-365 response element was predicted in the IL-6 3′-UTR with a seed sequence match. (2) miR-365 and its seed region are strictly conserved across species. The putative binding site of miR-365 to the IL-6 3′-UTR is broadly (although not strictly) conserved among vertebrates. 3) The activity of a luciferase reporter in which the IL-6 3′-UTR was fused to the downstream of the reporter gene was repressed by miR-365 overexpression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a luciferase reporter with MRE deletion or mutation in the IL-6 3′-UTR was no longer repressed by miR-365. And 4) the negative regulation of IL-6 at the protein level was further confirmed by ELISA.Previous studies have suggested the possibility that IL-6 could be regulated by miRNAs. For example, miR-146a modulates IL-6 expression in response to rising IL-6 levels to restrain excessive senescence associated secretory phenotype activity (37Bhaumik D. Scott G.K. Schokrpur S. Patil C.K. Orjalo A.V. Rodier F. Lithgow G.J. Campisi J. Aging. 2009; 1: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and miR-155 was shown to negatively regulate the induction of IL-6 expression in monocytes exposed to tumor culture supernatants (38He M. Xu Z. Ding T. Kuang D.M. Zheng L. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 6: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, no evidence exists to support the direct regulation of IL-6 by miR-146a or miR-155. Instead, it appears that miR-146a and miR-155 represses the expression of IL-6 indirectly by targeting upstream molecules IRAK1 and CEBP-β, respectively (37Bhaumik D. Scott G.K. Schokrpur S. Patil C.K. Orjalo A.V. Rodier F. Lithgow G.J. Campisi J. Aging. 2009; 1: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 38He M. Xu Z. Ding T. Kuang D.M. Zheng L. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 6: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that miR-365 directly regulates IL-6 level by classic interaction with its 3′-UTR. We further identified the MRE for miR-365 by using mutant reporters of IL-6 3′-UTR. More recently, Iliopoulos et al. (36Iliopoulos D. Hirsch H.A. Struhl K. Cell. 2009; 139: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) reported hsa-let-7a as a miRNA regulator of IL-6 that functions by direct interaction with 3′-UTR of IL-6. However, the MRE for let-7a is located in 316–322 bp of IL-6 3′-UTR, which is different from the region that occupied by miR-365 (Fig. 6A). Our data showed that, compared with let-7a, miR-365 exhibits a stronger inhibitory effect on IL-6 expression, as demonstrated by IL-6 3′-UTR luciferase reporter assay and IL-6 ELISA. Furthermore, the observation that the concentration of let-7a in a mixture of miR-365 and let-7a negatively correlated with the inhibitory effect on IL-6 expression further supported this conclusion (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, the result also showed that certain miRNA seems to exert function independently, and there is no synergistic or antagonistic action between the two miRNAs even they have the same target.As the importance of miRNA activity in gene regulation becomes increasingly evident, interest has focused on the mechanisms by which miRNAs are governed (8Taganov K.D.

In this study we investigated the transcriptional regulation of miR-365 and demonstrated that NF-κB and Sp1 are involved in miR-365 transcription. Overexpression of the NF-κB subunit p65 significantly induced activity of the miR-365 promoter, whereas pretreatment with an NF-κB-specific inhibitor inhibited the transcription of miR-365. Furthermore, the NF-κB transcription factor binding sites in the promoter of miR-365 were required for the transcription of miR-365, collectively suggesting that NF-κB plays a critical role in the biological processes of miR-365. Indeed, in addition to miR-365, miR-146a (8Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chen X.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3222-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have all also been found to be under the control of NF-κB. Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor and is indispensable for the development and survival of animals (43Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

Lafuse W.P. Zwilling B.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6924-6932Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 51Liu S. Wu L.C. Pang J. Santhanam R. Schwind S. Wu Y.Z. Hickey C.J. Yu J. Becker H. Maharry K.

Considering that our data show that both Sp1 and NF-κB contribute to the transcription of miR-365 and two NF-κB binding sites and one Sp1 binding site were found to be indispensable for miR-365 transcription, we speculated that cooperation between Sp1 and NF-κB in the transcriptional regulation of miR-365 might exist. The synergistic increase in the miR-365 promoter activity induced by co-expression of Sp1 and NF-κB p65 partly supported our hypothesis, but further studies are needed to test these possibilities.In addition to the NF-κB pathway, previous studies have revealed that the MAPK signaling pathway also plays a regulatory role in the generation of some miRNAs (35Paroo Z. Ye X. Chen S. Liu Q. Cell. 2009; 139: 112-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 52Cardinali B. Castellani L. Fasanaro P. Basso A. Alemà S. Martelli F. Falcone G.

In our study, pretreatment with ERK inhibitor significantly inhibited miR-365 promoter activity, indicating a regulatory role for ERK in the transcription of miR-365. Although p38 and JNK have been demonstrated to regulate the expression of other miRNAs, for example JNK regulating miR-155 and p38 regulating miR-34c (54O'Connell R.M. Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P.

Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (8921) Google Scholar). With the exception of IL-6, bioinformatics analyses have indicated other molecules, such as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 48 (USP48), heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8), zinc finger protein 148 (ZNF-148), and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK-1), are potential targets of miR-365 (Table 3). Interestingly, a very close correlation between these targets and NF-κB activation has been reported (56Tzimas C. Michailidou G. Arsenakis M. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Hatzivassiliou E.G. Cell.

These molecules regulate NF-κB by several mechanisms, including specific promoter binding activity as well as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. For example, SGK-1 facilitates NF-κB activation by phosphorylation of IKKα, which in turn leads to the degradation of IκBα (59Tai D.J. Su C.C. Ma Y.L. Lee E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4073-4089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). NF-κB has been shown to play a major role in LPS-induced expression of IL-6 or other inflammatory cytokines (30Kim B.H. Lee K.H. Chung E.Y. Chang Y.S. Lee H. Lee C.K. Min K.R. Kim Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 543: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is possible that, in addition to negative regulation of IL-6 expression by direct binding to the 3′-UTR of IL-6, miR-365 may also affect the activation of NF-κB and thereby indirectly inhibit IL-6 expression. Interestingly, we observed that overexpression of miR-365 significantly attenuated NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells (data not shown). Certainly, additional experiments should be performed to demonstrate the indirect regulation of IL-6 by miR-365.TABLE 3List of putative target genes of miR-365Target geneGene nameConserved sitesPoorly conserved sitesTotal context scoreAggregate PCTTotal8-Mer7-Mer-m87-Mer-1ATotal8-Mer7-Mer-m87-Mer-1ALPAR5Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 511002110−0.930.11NFIBNuclear factor I/B21101001−0.630.56ZNF148Zinc finger protein 14821101001−0.530.36TMOD3Tropomodulin 3 (ubiquitous)11000000−0.530.24SGK1Serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 111000000−0.520.42USP33Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 3311000000−0.480.53ZNF644Zinc finger protein 64411000000−0.470.47USP48Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 4811000000−0.470.51ARRDC3Arrestin domain containing 310011010−0.470.43LOC283514Similar to seven in absentia 211000000−0.470.55PIK3R3Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, regulatory subunit 3 (γ)10101100−0.430.24SGK3Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase family, member 310100000−0.290.24MAPK1IP1LMitogen-activated protein kinase 1 interacting protein 1-like10100000−0.290.24PRKAR2AProtein kinase, cAMP-dependent, regulatory, type II, α10100000−0.270.24HSPA8Heat shock 70-kDa protein 810100000−0.260.24 Open table in a new tab In conclusion, our studies identified miR-365 as a novel negative regulator of IL-6. In addition to direct negative regulation, miR-365 may regulate IL-6 expression indirectly. In vitro evidence indicated that miR-365 functions as a more powerful regulator of IL-6 than let-7a. NF-κB, Sp1, and ERK are involved in the expression of miR-365, suggesting that miR-365 is controlled by a complex network to exert its function in an appropriate manner.

Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (8921) Google Scholar). In mammals, miRNAs are initially transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and the primary miRNA transcripts are sequentially cut by RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer (2Lee Y. Jeon K. Lee J.T. Kim S.

The specificity of miRNAs is thought to be primarily mediated by residues 2–8 at the 5′ end of miRNA, also known as the seed region (7Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar).Growing evidence exists indicating that miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of inflammation. For example, miR-146a has been characterized as a negative regulator of the inflammatory response by targeting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor 6 (8Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3454) Google Scholar). Xiao et al. (9Xiao B. Liu Z. Li B.S. Tang B. Li W. Guo G. Shi Y.

FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). miRNAs regulate inflammation not only by targeting adapter proteins involved in the signaling pathway but also inflammatory mediators. Many interleukins have been found to be targets of miRNAs. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been identified as the target of hsa-miR-106a (11Sharma A. Kumar M. Aich J. Hariharan M. Brahmachari S.K.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-7 up-regulate IL-10 and IL-6 levels in murine macrophages and human myelomonocytic cells (12Qin Z. Kearney P. Plaisance K. Parsons C.H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2010; 87: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). miR-466l elevates IL-10 expression by preventing IL-10 mRNA degradation (13Ma F. Liu X. Li D. Wang P. Li N. Lu L. Cao X. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 6053-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). IL-13, a cytokine essential for expression for allergic lung disease, was recently found to be regulated by mmu-let-7a (14Polikepahad S. Knight J.M. Naghavi A.O. Oplt T. Creighton C.J. Shaw C.

Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). It was previously considered to be a regulator of acute-phase responses and a lymphocyte-stimulatory factor (17Hirano T. Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol.

However, recent advances have documented a series of IL-6 activities that are critical for resolving innate immunity and promoting acquired immunity (20Jones S.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3463-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). IL-6 expression can be regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (21Rambaldi A. Bettoni S. Rossi V.

Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but whether and how IL-6 is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by miRNA has so far been incompletely understood.In this study we establish that miR-365 is a novel miRNA regulator of human IL-6. miR-365 regulates the expression of IL-6 by classic interaction with the MRE in the 3′-UTR of IL-6 and further represses mRNA translation, although mRNA degradation is not involved. We also investigated the transcriptional regulation mechanism of miR-365.

Epithelial CCL20 mRNA increased 19-fold at 3 h, and protein increased ∼ 16-fold at 6 h after injury. Systemic or topical treatment of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with anti-CCL20 reduced γδ T-cell accumulation in the cornea by >50% with a concomitant decrease in epithelial healing and stromal inflammation. In addition to CCR6 and IL-17, corneal γδ T cells stained positively for RORγt, IL-23R, and IL-22. Anti-IL-22 reduced peak cell division of the healing epithelium by 52%. Treatment of TCRδ(-/-) mice with rIL-22 significantly promoted wound closure, with peak epithelial cell division increased >3-fold. In addition, rIL-22 restored neutrophil and platelet influx in the TCRδ(-/-) mice to wild-type levels and increased CXCL1 production by wounded corneal explants >2-fold. These results indicate that an important aspect of the healing response to corneal epithelial abrasion includes CCL20-dependent influx of CCR6(+) IL-17(+) IL-22(+) γδ T cells and that IL-22 contributes to the inflammatory response and promotes epithelial healing."

However, the mechanism underlying MST1 activation by H₂O₂ remains unknown. Here we show that peroxiredoxin-I (PRX-I) is an essential intermediate in H₂O₂-induced MST1 activation and cisplatin-induced cell death through p53. Cell stimulation with H₂O₂ resulted in PRX-I oxidation to form homo-oligomers and interaction with MST1, leading to MST1 autophosphorylation and augmentation of kinase activity. In addition, RNA interference knockdown experiments indicated that endogenous PRX-I is required for H₂O₂-induced MST1 activation. Live-cell imaging showed H₂O₂ generation by cisplatin treatment, which likewise caused PRX-I oligomer formation, MST1 activation and cell death. Cisplatin-induced PRX-I oligomer formation was not observed in embryonic fibroblasts obtained from p53-knockout mice, confirming the importance of p53. Indeed, ectopic expression of p53 induced PRX-I oligomer formation and cell death, both of which were cancelled by the antioxidant NAC. Moreover, we succeeded in reconstituting H₂O₂-induced MST1 activation in vitro, using purified PRX-I and MST1 proteins. Collectively, our results show a novel PRX-I function to cause cell death in response to high levels of oxidative stress by activating MST1, which underlies the p53-dependent cytotoxicity caused by anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2035663812,"Longitudinal axon fascicles within the Drosophila embryonic CNS provide connections between body segments and are required for coordinated neural signaling along the anterior-posterior axis. We show here that establishment of select CNS longitudinal tracts and formation of precise mechanosensory afferent innervation to the same CNS region are coordinately regulated by the secreted semaphorins Sema-2a and Sema-2b. Both Sema-2a and Sema-2b utilize the same neuronal receptor, plexin B (PlexB), but serve distinct guidance functions. Localized Sema-2b attraction promotes the initial assembly of a subset of CNS longitudinal projections and subsequent targeting of chordotonal sensory afferent axons to these same longitudinal connectives, whereas broader Sema-2a repulsion serves to prevent aberrant innervation. In the absence of Sema-2b or PlexB, chordotonal afferent connectivity within the CNS is severely disrupted, resulting in specific larval behavioral deficits. These results reveal that distinct semaphorin-mediated guidance functions converge at PlexB and are critical for functional neural circuit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2143718101,"The nematode C. elegans senses head and nose touch using multiple classes of mechanoreceptor neurons that are electrically coupled through a network of gap junctions. Using in vivo neuroimaging, we have found that multidendritic nociceptors in the head respond to harsh touch throughout their receptive field but respond to gentle touch only at the tip of the nose. Whereas the harsh touch response depends solely on cell-autonomous mechanosensory channels, gentle nose touch responses require facilitation by additional nose touch mechanoreceptors, which couple electrically to the nociceptors in a hub-and-spoke gap junction network. Conversely, nociceptor activity indirectly facilitates activation of the nose touch neurons, demonstrating that information flow across the network is bidirectional. Thus, a simple gap-junction circuit acts as a coincidence detector that allows primary sensory neurons to integrate information from neighboring mechanoreceptors and generate somatosensory perception."

TRAF7 promotes Lys-29-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO and p65 that results in lysosomal degradation of both proteins and altered activation. TRAF7 also influences p65 nuclear distribution.

Functionally, TRAF proteins act both as cytoplasmic regulatory molecules and as signal transducers for receptors involved in innate and adaptive humoral immune responses. There are seven known mammalian TRAF proteins (TRAF1–7), of which TRAF1–3 and -5–7 have been shown to interact directly or indirectly with members of the TNF receptor superfamily (1Bradley J.R.

The domain organization of TRAF proteins is made of a modular structure characteristic of adaptor proteins whose function is to link structurally dissimilar factors. TRAF proteins present a conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domain, the TRAF domain, which is involved in both homo- and heterodimerization (1Bradley J.R. Pober J.S.

However, TRAF7 lacks the conserved C-terminal domain found in TRAF1–6, and instead it has several WD40 repeats in its C-terminal domain (3Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G.

TRAF7 also binds to c-Myb and stimulates its sumoylation, thereby inhibiting its trans-activation activity (8Morita Y. Kanei-Ishii C. Nomura T. Ishii S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that TRAF7 is involved in the signal transduction pathway that links Toll-like receptor 2 stimulation to activation of NF-κB transcription factor (9Yoshida H. Jono H.

In fact, among the TRAF family of proteins, TRAF2, -5, and -6 are activators of the canonical NF-κB pathway, which involves activation of the IκB kinase complex, leading to the degradation of IκBα, nuclear translocation of the predominant p50/p65 transcription complex, and activation of genes with pleiotropic roles in cell survival and immune and inflammatory responses (10Ghosh S.

In an effort to discover proteins that interact with NEMO, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified TRAF7 as a NEMO-interacting protein. Here, we report a negative role for TRAF7 in NF-κB signaling. The two-hybrid screening was performed using the Matchmaker system (Clontech) as described previously (12Stilo R. Leonardi A. Formisano L. Di Jeso B. Vito P. Liguoro D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strain AH109 GAL4−/− was first transformed with pGBKT7 plasmids carrying a cDNA bait fused with DNA binding domain of GAL4 using the lithium acetate/PEG3000 procedure. Transformant colonies were selected on synthetic dropout plates lacking tryptophan. Expression of bait fusion proteins was assessed by immunoblot analysis. For library screening, yeast AH109 expressing GAL4DBD-NEMO(1–339) was transformed with a human cDNA library cloned in pACT2 vector (Clontech) in fusion with GAL4TAD. 2 × 106 clones were screened for interaction with GAL4DBD-NEMO(1–339) using selective growth on minimal medium lacking nutrients whose biosynthesis is mediated by genes under control of GAL4 transcriptional activity. HEK293 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Lentiviral vectors expressing shTRAF7 RNAs were obtained from Sigma and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids encoding mutant ubiquitins were a kind gift of Dr. C. Sasakawa, University of Tokyo. Sources of antisera and monoclonal antibodies were as follows: anti-TRAF7, Imgenex; anti-FLAG and anti-β-actin, Sigma; anti-NEMO, anti-HA, anti-p65, anti-ubiquitin (P4D1), anti-β tubulin, and anti-acetyl-histone H3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TNFα, IL1β, LPS, MG132, LPA, leupeptin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, ionomycin, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Cell lysates were made in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and immunocomplexes were bound to protein A/G (Roche Applied Science), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot assay. To analyze NEMO interaction with TRAF7, NEMO-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was generated in Escherichia coli DH5α cells using pGEX-5x-1 as plasmid (GE Healthcare). Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. NEMO-GST fusion protein expression was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Cells were lysed with five freeze-thaw cycles followed by 1 min of sonication. After centrifugation, soluble fraction was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in an EconoPac chromatography column (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates obtained from HEK293 cells were mixed with Sepharose-bound GST-NEMO (2 μg) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were spun down, washed three times with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors, and resuspended in Laemmli Buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting and incubation with TRAF7 antibody. To assess NF-κB and AP-1 activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmidic DNAs together with pNF-κB-luc or pAP-1-luc (Clontech) in 6-well plates. Silenced HeLa cells were transfected with Attractene reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, luciferase activity was determined with Luciferase assay system (Promega). Plasmids expressing RSV-β-galactosidase or TK-Renilla were used in transfection mixtures to normalize efficiency of transfection. HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown and transfected in chamber slides. 24 h later, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies in PBS followed by three washes with PBS and a second incubation with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, nuclei were stained with DAPI for 5 min. Chamber slides were dried and analyzed with fluorescence microscopy. All steps were done at room temperature. Single strand biotinylated cDNA was generated as follows; 100 ng of total RNA were subjected to two cycles of cDNA synthesis with the Ambion WT expression kit (Applera). The first cycle was performed using an engineered set of random primers that excludes rRNA-matching sequences and includes the T7 promoter sequence. After second strand synthesis, the resulting cDNA was transcribed in vitro with the T7 RNA polymerase to generate a cRNA. This cRNA was subjected to a second cycle-first strand synthesis in the presence of dUTP in a fixed ratio relative to dTTP. Single strand cDNA was then purified and fragmented with a mixture of uracil DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Affymetrix) that break the DNA strand specifically at the unnatural dUTP residues. DNA fragments were then terminally labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Affymetrix) with biotin. The biotinylated DNA was hybridized to the Human GeneChip Gene 1st Arrays (Affymetrix), containing almost 29,000 genes selected from Homo sapiens genome databases RefSeq, ENSEMBL, and GenBankTM. Chips were washed and scanned on the Affymetrix Complete GeneChip Instrument System, generating digitized image data files. Digitized image data files were analyzed by expression console (Affymetrix Inc.). The full data set was normalized by using the Robust Multialignment Algorithm. The expression values obtained were analyzed by using GeneSpring 10.3 (Agilent Technologies). Further normalization steps included a per chip normalization to the 50th percentile and a per gene normalization to the median. Results were filtered for fold change of >1.4. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance, using a p value cutoff of 0.05. Real time PCRs were performed in triplicate (primer sequences are detailed in supplemental data S2) by using the SYBR Green PCR master mix (Qiagen) in a 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The relative transcription level was calculated by using the ΔΔCt method. HEK293 cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, and lysed in lysis buffer (0,5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm KCl, 100 μm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and an antiprotease mixture). After centrifugation, the supernatant was used as a cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was first washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 100 μm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and antiprotease) and then extracted with Nuclear Extraction Buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 100 μm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and antiprotease). After centrifugation, the supernatant was used as nuclear fraction. All steps were done at 4 °C. At the end of each testing time, the culture supernatants were removed, and MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The MTT solution was removed, and isopropyl alcohol was added to dissolve formazan crystals. The absorbance at 570 nm was read on a microplate spectrophotometer (Applied Biosystem). The percentage of viability was calculated as (AT/AC) × 100, where AT and AC are the absorbance of treated and control cells, respectively. By using a yeast two-hybrid-based screening assay with NEMO(1–339) as a bait and a target human fetal brain cDNA library, we identified a total of 20 NEMO-positive unique interacting clones. One of them encoded a portion of TRAF7 spanning amino acidic residues 266–670 (TRAF(266–670)), thus consisting of a polypeptide containing a portion of the zinc finger domain, the coiled-coil domain, and the seven WD40 repeats. When tested in a bait/interactor format, NEMO was shown to interact with TRAF(266–670) in yeast (Table 1).TABLE 1Yeast AH109 was transformed with TRAF7(266–670) fused to the GAL4-TAD together with the indicated cDNAs fused to GAL4-DBDInteraction of NEMO with TRAF7 in the yeast two-hybrid assayProtein fused to GAL4 domainYeast growth on selective mediaDNA bindingActivatingTRAF7(266–670)−VectorTRAF7(266–670)−FADDTRAF7(266–670)−NEMO(1–339)TRAF7(266–670)+ Open table in a new tab To verify association of TRAF7 with NEMO in mammalian cells, lysates from HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF7, and coprecipitating proteins were analyzed for the presence of NEMO by the immunoblotting assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoprecipitation of endogenous TRAF7 revealed association with NEMO in HEK293 cell lysates. In the reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation of endogenous NEMO revealed the presence of coprecipitated TRAF7 (Fig. 1B). In both experiments, cell stimulation with TNFα induced TRAF7/NEMO interaction, which peaked at 20 min following stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Based on pulldown assays, GST-fused recombinant NEMO bound to the endogenous TRAF7 in HEK293 cell extracts (Fig. 1C). No pulldown was detectable using GST alone, indicating that NEMO specifically binds TRAF7 in vitro as well as in intact mammalian cells. In this experimental system, cellular stimulation with TNFα, LPA, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin did not increase association of recombinant NEMO with endogenous TRAF7 (Fig. 1C). Overall, this set of experiments demonstrates that there is a physical interaction between NEMO and TRAF7, which is induced, in vivo, by TNFα stimulation. To define the region of TRAF7 involved in the association with NEMO, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged TRAF7 polypeptides (Fig. 2A). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for endogenous NEMO, and the presence of coprecipitating TRAF7 polypeptides was assessed by immunoblots probed with anti-FLAG antibody. The results of these experiments, shown in Fig. 2B, indicated that in mammalian cells TRAF7(1–670), TRAF7(165–385), TRAF7(293–548), TRAF7(1–385a0, and TRAF7(165–670) associated with NEMO, whereas TRAF7(1–230) and TRAF7 (506–670) did not. Collectively, these experiments indicated that the coiled-coil domain of TRAF7 is required for association with NEMO. Similar experiments performed using deletion mutants of NEMO indicated that residues 1–230 of NEMO are required for binding to TRAF7 (Fig. 2C). Recently, we and others have shown that ubiquitination events play a key role in regulating the function of NEMO (4Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 13Stilo R. Varricchio E. Liguoro D. Leonardi A. Vito P. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether TRAF7 was able to influence the ubiquitination state of NEMO. For this, we transfected HEK293 cells with TRAF7 and assessed the ubiquitination state of NEMO by immunoblot experiments. As shown in Fig. 3A, TRAF7 promoted endogenous ubiquitination of NEMO in a dose-dependent manner. The NEMO ubiquitinating activity was retained in a TRAF7 deletion mutant that contains the ring finger domain, which was lost in a TRAF7 deletion mutant that lacks that domain (Fig. 3B). As ubiquitin possesses seven lysines (Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-27, Lys-29, Lys-33, Lys-48, and Lys-63) and the fate of ubiquitinated proteins depends on the Lys-type of linkage, we used a series of ubiquitin mutants possessing single lysine residues to investigate the nature of TRAF7-mediated ubiquitination of NEMO. NEMO was only ubiquitinated by the Lys-29-Ub (K29-Ub) mutant to a similar extent as by wild-type ubiquitin (Fig. 3C). In the same experimental condition, TRAF6 promoted Lys-63 ubiquitination of NEMO (Fig. 3D), thus validating the specificity of Lys-29-ubiquitination mediated by TRAF7. As ubiquitination of NEMO regulates activation of the IκB kinase complex (4Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), we tested whether expression of TRAF7 modulates activation of the NF-κB transcription factor using an NF-κB-luciferase reporter assay. In all the experimental conditions tested, TRAF7 was unable to activate NF-κB (data not shown). However, we noted that TRAF7 expression dramatically reduces NF-κB activation induced by either exogenous stimuli, such as TNFα, IL-1β, LPS, and LPA treatments, or by transfection of expression vectors encoding for well known activators of NF-κB (Fig. 4, A and B). In the same experimental system, TRAF7 expression induced AP-1 activity at least 9–10-fold compared with empty vector, which is higher than the AP-1 activity elicited by TNFα stimulation (Fig. 4C). We also measured the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRAF7 on the expression of an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter construct. For this, we used a lentiviral expression vector encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to target human TRAF7 for degradation by the RNAi pathway. Lentivirus infection of HeLa cells resulted in reduced TRAF7 protein expression (Fig. 4D). When assayed in the NF-κB-luciferase reporter tests, this construct produced a higher NF-κB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained when HEK293 cells were used for these experiments (data not shown). Inhibition of NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells expressing TRAF7 was also assessed by monitoring degradation of the inhibitory subunit I-κBα following TNFα stimulation. Immunoblot assays indicate that TRAF7 partially suppresses degradation of the inhibitory subunit I-κBα and delays p65 entry into the nucleus following TNFα treatment (supplemental data S1). Overall, these experiments indicated that TRAF7 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB and functions as a positive regulator of AP-1. Surprisingly, TRAF7 expression also inhibited activation of NF-κB induced by transfection of a plasmid encoding for the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 5A). This observation prompted us to investigate whether TRAF7 expression alters the ubiquitination state of p65, thereby influencing its transcriptional activity. For this, we transfected HEK293 cells with exogenous HA-tagged ubiquitin and assessed the ubiquitination state of endogenous p65 by immunoblot experiments. As shown in Fig. 5B, TRAF7 promoted ubiquitination on p65. The same result was obtained when we monitored both p65 and ubiquitin endogenous proteins (Fig. 5C). Also, experiments done using mutated ubiquitins indicated that, similarly to NEMO, TRAF7 promotes Lys-29-linked ubiquitination of p65 (Fig. 5D). It is well known that a variety of coregulators influence NF-κB signaling, and most of these can physically associate with NF-κB family proteins (14Gao Z. Chiao P. Zhang X. Zhang X. Lazar M.A. Seto E. Young H.A. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21091-21098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether TRAF7 can physically bind to p65. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous TRAF7 revealed a strong association with endogenous p65 in HeLa and HEK293 cells upon TNFα stimulation (Fig. 5E). In addition, cell fractionation experiments revealed that, following TNFα stimulation, the cytoplasmic levels of p65 and TRAF7 association increase, whereas the nuclear association follows an opposite kinetic (Fig. 5F). In similar fractionation experiments, p65 appears ubiquitinated by TRAF7 in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments (Fig. 5G). As Lys-29 ubiquitination has been linked to lysosomal degradation (20Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we monitored the expression levels of endogenous NEMO and p65 in the presence of TRAF7 in cells untreated or treated with lysosomal (leupeptin + NH4Cl) or proteasomal (MG132) inhibitors. In untreated cells, TRAF7 expression lowered the protein levels of both NEMO and p65 (Fig. 5H, 1st and 2nd lanes). Treatment with MG132 does not restore NEMO and p65 expression (Fig. 5H, 9th and 10th lanes), thus excluding the possibility of a TRAF7-mediated proteasomal degradation of these proteins. However, in cells exposed to the lysosomal inhibitors, the expression levels of NEMO and p65 are not significantly different in cells transfected with empty vector or TRAF7 (Fig. 5H, 5th to 8th lanes). We next tested whether TRAF7 influences the cellular distribution of p65. For this, we transfected HEK293 cells with a vector encoding for p65, either alone or in the presence of an excess of TRAF7, and determined the cellular localization of p65. The results in Fig. 6A show that whereas p65 alone exhibits a uniform pattern of cytosolic and nuclear distribution, in the presence of TRAF7 it localizes in discrete and punctate nuclear structures. We also determined the localization of endogenous p65 in HeLa cells expressing a shRNA targeting TRAF7 or expressing a scramble shRNA. These experiments, shown in Fig. 6B, indicate that TRAF7 knockdown results in increased nuclear localization of endogenous p65 in unstimulated cells. To assess the role of TRAF7 in global transcriptome, finally we compared TRAF7-silenced versus nonspecific siRNA-infected cells on Affymetrix microarrays. Analysis was conducted in triplicate, and significant gene expression variation was considered for a fold change ≥1.4, corresponding to the average reduction of TRAF7 gene expression in silenced cells. Data analysis identified 55 varying genes, of which 14 were up-regulated (25.4%) and 41 were down-regulated (74.6%) in silenced cells with respect to control cells. A selection of these genes was confirmed by real time PCR (Fig. 7 and data not shown). Genes up-regulated in TRAF7-silenced cells included the NF-κB regulated gene serine protease inhibitor serpin2E and the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 and -7, and α-synuclein (Table 2). Among genes down-regulated in TRAF7-silenced cells, there are several stress-related genes, and cell cycle-related genes (Table 3).TABLE 2Up-regulated genes in TRAF7-silenced cellsiTRAF7 versus WTUp-regulated genesCluster IDGene symbolGenBankTM17919627HIST2H4ABC10826027931097HTRA1D8725837975390SMOC1AK28998847987315ACTC1BC00997857991335ANPEPBC05892867995681MMP2BC00257678007100IGFBP4BC01604188035829RPL34|LOC342994CR54224298056860WIPF1BX640870108059376SERPINE2BC042628118100541IGFBP7BC017201128101762SNCABC108275138134257GNG11BC009709148141016TFPI2AK129833 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Down-regulated genes in TRAF7-silenced cellsiTRAF7 versus* WTDown-regulated genesCluster IDGene symbolGenbankTM17898693ALPLBC09086127919856LASS2BC00135737925929AKR1C3BC00147947927964SRGNBC01551657931832AKR1C2BC06357467942123CCND1BC02362077942957PRSS23BC00127887948229SLC43A3AB02892797953291CD9AY966455107956076CDK2BC003065117960340FOXM1U74612127960933M6PRBC024206137983650SLC27A2D88308147992529TRAF7AY569455158005475TRIM16LDQ232882|AK056026168018975LGALS3BPL13210178025672SLC44A2BC040556188034940NOTCH3U97669198049670GPC1X54232208065637COMMD7BC022073218067652EEF1A2BC110409228072577YWHAHS80794238072610FBXO7BC008361248074856PRAMEBC022008258080184ALAS1AY260745268080714FLNBAF043045278090214SLC12A8|ZNF148AF345197288090433MGLLBC006230298090823SLCO2A1U70867308096704NPNTAK290029318110408THOC3|LOC728554BC006849328110569SQSTM1BC001874338114920DPYSL3BC077077348115234ANXA6BC017046358115886THOC3|LOC728554BC006849368116780DSPM77830378134869PCOLCEAB008549388135990FLNCAF089841398138773EIF4HBC021214408143684PDIA4BC011754418144669FDFT1BC009251 Open table in a new tab Because NF-κB transcription factor has a beneficial effect on cell survival and proliferation, we predicted that expression of TRAF7 has a negative effect on cell viability. In fact, the result of the MTT assay shown in Fig. 8A indicates that TRAF7 expression by itself reduces cellular viability, and in addition, it potentiates the cytotoxic effect of TNFα. Conversely, TRAF7-silenced cells exhibit higher resistance to TNFα-induced cell death. Similar results were obtained when cell viability was measured using the ATPlite assay (data not shown). Microscopy data confirmed this observation. Micrographs shown in Fig. 8B demonstrate that TRAF7 expression caused cellular condensation, roundup, and detachment of cells from the dish, all characteristics of apoptotic cell death. In this study, we have identified TRAF7 as a protein that physically interacts with NEMO and with the p65 member of the NF-κB transcription factor family. This finding is consistent with the work by Bouwmeester et al. (3Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G. Drewes G. Gavin A.C. Jackson D.B. Joberty G. Neubauer G. Rick J. Kuster B. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), which led to the identification of TRAF7 as a molecule participating with an interaction network of signaling proteins of the TNF receptor I. TRAF7 was also identified as a protein interacting with MEKK3 and potentiating MEKK3-induced AP-1 activation (7Xu L.G. Li L.Y. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17278-17282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The study by Bouwmeester et al. (3Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G. Drewes G. Gavin A.C. Jackson D.B. Joberty G. Neubauer G. Rick J. Kuster B. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that TRAF7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase capable of self-ubiquitination. We have now identified at least two substrates, namely NEMO and p65, whose ubiquitination status is, directly or indirectly, influenced by TRAF7. It is generally accepted that nondegradative Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of signaling molecules, including NEMO, represents a mechanism for IκB kinase recruitment and activation (4Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have shown that the deubiquitinating enzymes CYLD and A20 suppress NF-κB activation by targeting Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains on NF-κB signaling factors (13Stilo R. Varricchio E. Liguoro D. Leonardi A. Vito P. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R.

We now report that TRAF7 effectively promotes Lys-29-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO and p65, targeting these two proteins for lysosomal degradation. Lys-29-linked ubiquitination has been recently implicated in the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinases. AMP-activated protein kinase family member 5 and MAPK/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 are polyubiquitinated in vivo through Lys-29/Lys-33-coupled chains (19Al-Hakim A.K. Zagorska A. Chapman L. Deak M. Peggie M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This event blocks kinase activation by interfering with phosphorylation of the activation-loop residues (19Al-Hakim A.K. Zagorska A. Chapman L. Deak M. Peggie M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). More importantly, Lys-29-linked polyubiquitin chains formed by the E3 ligase Itch/AIP4 have been implicated in lysosomal degradation of proteins (20Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the already described mechanisms (21Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 22Saccani S. Marazzi I. Beg A.A. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Geng H. Wittwer T. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Schmitz M.L. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we propose that Lys-29 ubiquitination and the consequent lysosomal degradation of NEMO and p65 may represent an additional mechanism to control NF-κB activity. The experiments done using lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors clearly support this evidence. However, as cells exposed to lysosomal inhibitors express lower levels of NEMO and p65 (Fig. 5H), it is possible that other proteasomal-independent mechanisms regulate NEMO and p65 protein levels. In addition to lysosomal degradation, the TRAF7-dependent Lys-29 ubiquitination of p65 might also influence the transcriptional activity of p65. Ubiquitination has in fact emerged as a crucial mechanism that controls activity of transcription factors, including p53, c-Jun, and NF-κB (22Saccani S. Marazzi I. Beg A.A. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M.

Our experiments clearly show that TRAF7 induces compartmentalization of p65 into morphologically distinct structures resembling the nuclear bodies (27Zimber A. Nguyen Q.D. Gespach C. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1085-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and it is well known that certain nuclear bodies influence various cellular activities, including apoptosis and transcriptional regulation (28Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Thus, given our results, we speculate that TRAF7 may also regulate the transcriptional activity of p65 by influencing its nuclear distribution. Our data indicate that p65/TRAF7 interaction can take place both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. This is in agreement with previous works showing that TRAF7 has both a cytosolic and nuclear localization (8Morita Y. Kanei-Ishii C. Nomura T. Ishii S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Yoshida H. Jono H. Kai H. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41111-41121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the interaction in different cell compartments may have different biological implications. The microarray analysis conducted in this work provides some valuable information on the transcriptional regulation modulated by TRAF7. Among the genes up-regulated in TRAF7-deficient cells, there are two direct targets of NF-κB, namely serpin2A (29Hampson L. Hampson I.N. Babichuk C.K. Cotter L. Bleackley R.C. Dexter T.M. Cross M.A. Hematol. J. 2001; 2: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) (30Liu L.P. Liang H.F. Chen X.P. Zhang W.G. Yang S.L. Xu T. Ren L. Cancer Invest. 2010; 28: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and two genes, IGFBP4 and IGFBP7, that belong to a family of proteins (31Ruan W. Lai M. Acta Diabetol. 2010; 47: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) of which two members are direct targets of NF-κB (32Cazals V. Nabeyrat E. Corroyer S. de Keyzer Y. Clement A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Lang C.H. Nystrom G.J. Frost R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G719-G727PubMed Google Scholar). However, TRAF7-deficient cells show, among others, down-regulation of the stress-related genes ceramide synthase 2 (LASS2), the ubiquitin-binding protein p62 (SQSMT1), and the apoptosis-related gene serglycin (SRGN) (34Metkar S.S.

Overall, these expression data are consistent with an inhibitory role for TRAF7 on NF-κB activation and a positive control of AP-1 transcription factor. Clearly, our work opens many interesting questions concerning TRAF7 function that require further investigation. In this context, the generation of animal models genetically modified in the locus encoding for TRAF7 will be certainly of enormous value to finally define the physiological role of this protein.

https://openalex.org/W1983438616,"P73 is important in drug-induced apoptosis in some cancer cells, yet its role in the regulation of chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer (OVCA) is poorly understood. Furthermore, if and how the deregulation of p73-mediated apoptosis confers resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) treatment is unclear. Here we demonstrate that TAp73α over-expression enhanced CDDP-induced PARP cleavage and apoptosis in both chemosensitive (OV2008 and A2780s) and their resistant counterparts (C13* and A2780cp) and another chemoresistant OVCA cells (Hey); in contrast, the effect of ΔNp73α over-expression was variable. P73α downregulation attenuated CDDP-induced PUMA and NOXA upregulation and apoptosis in OV2008 cells. CDDP decreased p73α steady-state protein levels in OV2008, but not in C13*, although the mRNA expression was identical. CDDP-induced p73α downregulation was mediated by a calpain-dependent pathway. CDDP induced calpain activation and enhanced its cytoplasmic interaction and co-localization with p73α in OV2008, but not C13* cells. CDDP increased the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in OV2008 but not C13* whereas cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, caused this response and calpain activation, p73α processing and apoptosis in both cell types. CDDP-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase in OV2008 cells was not effected by the elimination of extracellular Ca(2+), but this was attenuated by the depletion of internal Ca(2+) store, indicating that mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+]) stores was potentially involved. These findings demonstrate that p73α and its regulation by the Ca(2+)-mediated calpain pathway are involved in CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA cells and that dysregulation of Ca(2+)/calpain/p73 signaling may in part be the pathophysiology of CDDP resistance. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance will direct the development of effective strategies for the treatment of chemoresistant OVCA."
https://openalex.org/W2011507021,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is one of the few evolutionarily conserved focal adhesion proteins involved in diverse cell adhesion-dependent physiological and pathological responses. Despite more than a decade of studies and extensive literature, the kinase function of ILK is controversial. ILK contains a highly degraded kinase active site but it has been argued that ILK may be an unusual manganese (Mn)-dependent serine-threonine kinase that targets specific substrates such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). In this study, we have tackled this issue by a systematic bottom-up biochemical, proteomic, structural, and thermodynamic analysis of ILK. We show that recombinant ILK from either bacteria or mammalian cells exhibits no kinase activity on GSK-3β in the presence of either Mn2+ or the conventional kinase co-factor Mg2+. A comprehensive and unbiased whole cell-based kinase assay using entire mammalian CG-4 and C2C12 cell lysate did not identify any specific ILK substrates. High resolution crystallographic structure analysis further confirmed that the Mn-bound ILK adopts the same pseudo active site conformation as that of the Mg-bound ILK. More importantly, thermodynamic analysis revealed that the K220M mutation, previously thought to inactivate ILK by disrupting ATP binding, significantly impairs the structural integrity and stability of ILK, which provides a new basis for understanding how this mutation caused renal agenesis, a failure of fetal kidney development. Collectively, our data provide strong evidence that ILK lacks intrinsic kinase function. It is a bona fide pseudokinase that likely evolved from an ancestral catalytic counterpart to act as a distinct scaffold to mediate protein-protein interactions during focal adhesion assembly and many other cellular events.

Upon activation, the integrin extracellular domain adheres to the ECM by binding to numerous ligands such as fibronectin and fibrinogen. However, for cells to firmly adhere to the ECM, integrins must connect to the backbone of the cell, the actin cytoskeleton, via its cytoplasmic tails (CTs) (1Hynes R.O.

Such connection is mediated by the supramolecular focal adhesion (FAs) complex. The reassembly/disassembly of FAs can lead to dynamic cell adhesion processes such as cell migration and spreading, which are fundamental for a variety of physiological responses. Over the past decades, major effort has been made to search for proteins involved in FA assembly and regulation. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) was discovered in 1996 as a binding partner of integrin β CTs (3Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3121-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, ILK has some significant variations in the putative catalytic site, suggesting that ILK may be a pseudokinase (16Boudeau J. Miranda-Saavedra D. Barton G.J. Allesi D.R.

Approximately 10% of the human kinome encodes for proteins that lack one or more catalytic residues, suggesting a class of pseudokinases (16Boudeau J. Miranda-Saavedra D. Barton G.J. Allesi D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 466-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (413) Google Scholar). While multiple laboratories have independently confirmed some representative pseudokinases such as STRADα (28Zeqiraj E. Filippi B.M. Goldie S. Navratilova I. Boudeau J. Deak M.

Structure. 2009; 17: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a few previously proposed pseudokinases have been recently shown to still exhibit kinase activity possibly by some alternative structural mechanisms (30Zeqiraj E. van Aalten D.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, WNK kinase lacks a conserved catalytic lysine residue that is spatially compensated for by another nearby lysine that promotes catalysis (31Min X. Lee B.H. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 1303-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, combined structural and functional analyses should be performed to definitively define a pseudokinase. In the case of ILK, a high resolution structural analysis has recently shown that its catalytic site is highly degraded, which cannot be compensated for by any alternative residues (14Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterizations further demonstrated that either bacteria-purified recombinant ILK or endogenous ILK was incapable of phosphorylating integrin β CTs, parvin, AKT, and the generic kinase substrate myelin basic protein, and it was suggested that the ILK purported activity might be due to heterogeneous components present in the partially purified ILK materials or indirect effects from cell-based experiments (14Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Consensus seems to emerge from the perspective of both ILK function (18Wickström S.A. Lange A. Montanez E. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and enzymology (30Zeqiraj E. van Aalten D.M. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Sci. 2011; 36: 65-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) that ILK is a pseudokinase. Nevertheless, controversy continues with growing studies still indicating that ILK is a kinase (26Maydan M. McDonald P.C. Sanghera J. Yan J. Rallis C. Pinchin S. Hannigan G.E. Foster L.J.

Sanghera J. Yan J. Rallis C. Pinchin S. Hannigan G.E. Foster L.J. Ish-Horowicz D. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported that ILK is a manganese (Mn)-dependent serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates GSK-3β. This is completely inconsistent with the recent genetic and mutagenesis studies, which showed that ILK harboring a putative hyperactive mutation (S343D) or a putative kinase inactive mutation (K220A; K220M) had no effect on GSK-3β phosphorylation (21Lange A. Wickström S.A. Jakobson M. Zent R. Sainio K. Fässler R. Nature. 2009; 461: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It also contradicts the structural data that revealed a severely degraded catalytic core in ILK incapable of conferring the phosphor-transfer reaction, as is required for a bona fide GSK-3 kinase such as AKT (37Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To gain a clear insight into the function of ILK, we have undertaken a rigorous investigation of ILK by using a multidisciplinary approach. Here we show that either ILK expressed in bacteria or mammalian cells did not exhibit kinase activity on GSK-3β. Moreover, a comprehensive whole cell-based search did not identify any potential substrates for ILK. Using structural and thermodynamic approaches, we also found that the conserved ATP-binding lysine 220, which was previously thought to perform a catalytic function, plays a vital role in the structural integrity and stability of ILK, which explains why the mutation caused a defect in kidney development (21Lange A.

Our results thus provide conclusive evidence that ILK is a bona fide pseudokinase and points to a new direction for elucidating the role of ILK in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9) and anti-AKT antibodies, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused GSK-3 α/β (Ser-21/9) crosstide protein were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-ILK and anti-GST antibodies and anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (Gibbstown, NJ). Recombinant GST-fused active full-length AKT1 was purchased from SignalChem (Richmond, BC, Canada). Recombinant affinity purified Myc-tagged human full-length ILK was purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD). Recombinant p38α kinase was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). The bicistronic coexpression plasmid for the human ILK KD (residues 183–452)/α-parvin CH2 complex (residues 248–372) was generated using a pST39 vector (38Tan S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as previously described (14Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Two surface-exposed cysteine residues of ILK KD (Cys-346 and Cys-422) were substituted by serine residues (Ser-346 and Ser-422) to increase the protein solubility for x-ray structural analysis. The His-tagged recombinant ILK KD/CH2 complex was expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein complex was purified from the bacterial cell lysate by Ni-affinity column, followed by HiLoad 16/60 Superdex75 gel filtration and Resource-S cation-exchange chromatography columns (all from GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), as previously described (14Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ILK KD mutant (K220M or K220A)/CH2 complex was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with appropriate primer sets. The mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified as for the wild type. The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. The coexpression plasmid for full-length ILK (residues 1–452)/maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused PINCH LIM1–2 (residues 1–127) complex was also generated as previously described (14Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ILK/MBP-PINCH LIM1–2 complex was expressed in E. coli, and the protein complex was purified by MBPTrap affinity column, followed by HiLoad 16/60 Superdex200 gel filtration chromatography column (both from GE Healthcare). The hexahistidine-tagged α-parvin CH2 protein (residues 248–372) was expressed and purified as previously described (39Wang X. Fukuda K. Byeon I.J. Velyvis A. Wu C. Gronenborn A. Qin J. J. Biol.

The α-parvin CH2 gene was also subcloned into a pGEX4T1 vector, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused CH2 protein was expressed in E. coli, and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PINCH LIM1–2 (residues 1–127) was also subcloned into a pGEX4T1 vector, and the GST-fused PINCH LIM1–2 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin according to the manufacturer's protocol. All the DNA constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. Each purified GST-fused α-parvin CH2 or GST (5 μg each) was immobilized on 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated in pull-down binding buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The mammalian Myc-tagged ILK was added in each affinity bead by concentration-dependent addition (1 μg or 3 μg), and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C by a rotor for 2 h. The beads were extensively washed three times using binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 20 mm reduced glutathione in binding buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) for Western blot analysis. The bound proteins were probed with appropriate antibodies and detected using Pierce ECL Western blotting Substrate (Thermo SCIENTIFIC). Non-radioactive in vitro phosphorylation assay of GSK-3β was performed according to a previous report (26Maydan M. McDonald P.C. Sanghera J. Yan J. Rallis C. Pinchin S. Hannigan G.E. Foster L.J. Ish-Horowicz D. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by Western blot analysis with phospho-specific antibody. Briefly, the kinase assay was carried out in 50 μl of kinase reaction mixture consisting of 2 μg of GST-fused GSK-3 α/β crosstide, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2), Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (Roche), 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 85 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The bacterial or Myc-tagged mammalian ILK proteins were added in the reaction mixtures in a dose-dependent manner from 0.8 to 8 μg or from 0.1 to 2.5 μg, respectively. For the kinase inhibition studies by CH2, the quantity of mammalian ILK was set to 0.5 μg for each reaction. For the positive control for phosphorylation of GSK-3β, GST-fused active AKT protein (0.1 μg) was used. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and blocked by blocking buffer containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylated GSK-3β proteins were detected by anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9)-specific antibody according to the manufacturer's instruction. Each kinase assay was repeated at least two times. Kinase-inactive CG-4 (and C2C12) cell lysate for the kinase assays was prepared as follows. Briefly, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The cell lysate was treated at a concentration of 2 mg/ml with 20 mm 5′-4-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) solubilized in DMSO for 1 h at 30 °C to inactivate endogenous kinases, and designated as kinase-inactive cell lysate. The lysate was then diluted 1:5 with Nonidet P-40 buffer without protease inhibitors and desalted using Millipore Amicon Ultra filtration columns with a 10 kDa molecular mass cutoff. Following concentration, the lysate concentration was adjusted to 4 mg/ml with Nonidet P-40 buffer and diluted 1:2 with 2× kinase assay buffer (40 mm MOPS pH 7.2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 50 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2), 400 μm cold ATP, 2.5 μCi of [32P]ATP). Each kinase assay was performed in kinase assay buffer containing 100 μg of kinase-inactive lysate and each kinase, as indicated in the legend of Fig. 3. The kinase reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h, terminated by addition of 5× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. ATP-binding to ILK KD was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry with an iTC200 instrument from MicroCal (Northampton, MA). Typically, 300 μm of ATP solution containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 was titrated into 30 μm solution of the purified ILK KD/CH2 complex. The experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, and 0.5 mm tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride. All solutions were degassed before being loaded into the cell and the titration syringe. The mixing speed was set at 800 rpm. The reference power was set to 6 μcal/s. The binding experiment was carried out in duplicate. The isothermal titration curves were recorded and analyzed using the ORIGIN software, as implemented in the iTC200 instrument, with a one site binding model. Fluorescence measurements were made using a QM-6SE (PTI, London, Ontario) spectrofluorometer. Sample temperature was controlled by a Peltier cell holder maintaining the heating rate of 60 °C/h. All intrinsic tryptophan residue fluorescence measurements were performed with excitation at 290 nm, emission at 335 nm and Glan polarizers at magic angle conditions. CD measurements were performed with a Jasco model J-715 (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) spectropolarimeter equipped with a computer controlled Peltier sample holder. All measurements were taken in a 1 mm pathlength cell and corrected for solvent signal. The thermal stability of proteins was monitored at 222 nm by heating samples at a rate of 60 °C/h over the range 10–70 °C. The ellipticity was recorded at 0.5 °C intervals with time constant of 16 s. Co-crystals of the ILK KD/CH2 in complex with manganese and ATP were grown at 4 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in drops containing a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of protein solution (∼0.2 mm) and reservoir solution consisting of 50 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.8, 12.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 5000 mono methyl ether, and 5% (v/v) 1-propyl alcohol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K using a Rigaku MicroMax-007HF microfocusing rotating anode generator (λ = 1.5418 Å), a Saturn 944+ CCD detector, and X-stream 2000 cooling system (The Case Pharmacology x-ray Facility, Cleveland, OH). The co-crystals of the MnATP bound form of the ILK KD/CH2 complex were isomorphous to those of the MgATP-bound form (14Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and contained one ILK KD/CH2 complex bound to each manganese and ATP per asymmetric unit. The data were processed and scaled using the d*TREK (40Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of the ILK KD/CH2 in complex with magnesium/ATP (Protein Data Bank code 3KMW) were used after omitting ATP, magnesium, and solvent molecules as the starting model for the refinement. The initial model was subjected to rigid-body refinement, followed by simulated annealing, positional and B-factor refinement, supplemented in CNS (41Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L.

https://openalex.org/W2097543455,"Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) is a plasma membrane scavenger and signaling receptor, composed of a large ligand-binding subunit (515-kDa α-chain) linked to a shorter transmembrane subunit (85-kDa β-chain). LRP-1 cell-surface level and function are controlled by proteolytic shedding of its ectodomain. Here, we identified ectodomain sheddases in human HT1080 cells and demonstrated regulation of the cleavage by cholesterol by comparing the classical fibroblastoid type with a spontaneous epithelioid variant, enriched ∼ 2-fold in cholesterol. Two membrane-associated metalloproteinases were involved in LRP-1 shedding: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-12 (ADAM-12) and membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Although both variants expressed similar levels of LRP-1, ADAM-12, MT1-MMP, and specific tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), LRP-1 shedding from epithelioid cells was ∼4-fold lower than from fibroblastoid cells. Release of the ectodomain was triggered by cholesterol depletion in epithelioid cells and impaired by cholesterol overload in fibroblastoid cells. Modulation of LRP-1 shedding on clearance was reflected by accumulation of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in the medium. We conclude that cholesterol exerts an important control on LRP-1 levels and function at the plasma membrane by modulating shedding of its ectodomain, and therefore represents a novel regulator of extracellular proteolytic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2037710041,"Sialyl Lewis antigens, sialyl Lewis a and sialyl Lewis x, are utilized as tumor markers, and their increase in cancer is associated with tumor progression by enhancement of cancer cell adhesion to endothelial E-selectin. However, regulation mechanisms are not fully understood. We previously demonstrated that NEU4 is the only sialidase efficiently acting on mucins and it is down-regulated in colon cancer. To elucidate the significance of NEU4 down-regulation, we investigated sialyl Lewis antigens as endogenous substrates for the sialidase. NEU4 was found to hydrolyze the antigens <i>in vitro</i> and decrease cell surface levels much more effectively than other sialidases. Western blot, thin layer chromatography, and metabolic inhibition studies of desialylation products revealed NEU4 to preferentially catalyze sialyl Lewis antigens expressed on <i>O-</i>glycans. Cell adhesion to and motility and growth on E-selectin were significantly reduced by NEU4. E-selectin stimulation of colon cancer cells enhanced cell motility through activation of the p38/Hsp27/actin reorganization pathway, whereas NEU4 attenuated the signaling. On immunocytochemical analysis, some NEU4 molecules were localized at cell surfaces. Under hypoxia conditions whereby the antigens were increased concomitantly with several sialyl- and fucosyltransferases, NEU4 expression was markedly decreased. These results suggest that NEU4 plays an important role in control of sialyl Lewis antigen expression and its impairment in colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2003087616,"Caloric restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention known to enhance cardiovascular health. The glucose analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) mimics CR effects in several animal models. However, whether 2-DG is beneficial to the heart remains obscure. Here, we tested the ability of 2-DG to reduce cardiomyocyte death triggered by doxorubicin (DOX, 1 μm), an antitumor drug that can cause heart failure. Treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with 0.5 mm 2-DG dramatically suppressed DOX cytotoxicity as indicated by a decreased number of cells that stained positive for propidium iodide and reduced apoptotic markers. 2-DG decreased intracellular ATP levels by 17.9%, but it prevented DOX-induced severe depletion of ATP, which may contribute to 2-DG-mediated cytoprotection. Also, 2-DG increased the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Blocking AMPK signaling with compound C or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the catalytic subunit markedly attenuated the protective effects of 2-DG. Conversely, AMPK activation by pharmacological or genetic approach reduced DOX cardiotoxicity but did not produce additive effects when used together with 2-DG. In addition, 2-DG induced autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway whose activation could be either protective or detrimental depending on the context. Paradoxically, despite its ability to activate autophagy, 2-DG prevented DOX-induced detrimental autophagy. Together, these results suggest that the CR mimetic 2-DG can antagonize DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death, which is mediated through multiple mechanisms, including the preservation of ATP content, the activation of AMPK, and the inhibition of autophagy.

CR was first reported to extend life span in rats 93 years ago (1Osborne T.B. Mendel L.B. Ferry E.L. Science. 1917; 45: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This result has since been reproduced in diverse model systems, including yeast, nematode worms, flies, fish, mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys (2Martin B. Golden E. Egan J.M. Mattson M.P. Maudsley S.

Not surprisingly, enhancing cardiovascular health and preventing tumorigenesis or inhibiting tumor growth appear to be the major mechanisms by which CR retards aging and extends life span (6Mattson M.P.

Indeed, CR was shown to slow aging in Rhesus monkeys by delaying the onset of age-associated pathologies, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (5Colman R.J. Anderson R.M. Johnson S.C. Kastman E.K. Kosmatka K.J. Beasley T.M. Allison D.B. Cruzen C. Simmons H.A. Kemnitz J.W. Weindruch R. Science. 2009; 325: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Despite the extraordinary ability of CR to prolong life, it is difficult to implement and sustain a CR regimen in humans. Thus, increasing research interest has focused on identifying agents that can mimic CR health-promoting effects without the need to reduce calorie intake. Several compounds have shown potential as a CR mimetic that can improve cardiovascular health and inhibit tumor growth, such as 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) and resveratrol (12Ingram D.K. Zhu M.

The glucose analog 2-DG can enter cells and be phosphorylated but not further metabolized, thus competitively blocking glucose utilization presumably mimicking CR effects at the cellular level. In support of this notion, 2-DG has been shown to produce beneficial effects reminiscent of CR in several animal models (12Ingram D.K. Zhu M. Mamczarz J. Zou S. Lane M.A. Roth G.S. deCabo R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 14Ingram D.K. Anson R.M. de Cabo R. Mamczarz J. Zhu M. Mattison J. Lane M.A. Roth G.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Specifically, 2-DG can decrease insulin levels and body temperature, two changes that typically occur in animals subjected to CR (15Ingram D.K. Roth G.S. Exp. Gerontol. 2011; 46: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It can also decrease resting blood pressure and heart rate and markedly enhance cardiovascular adaptation to stress (16Wan R. Camandola S. Mattson M.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1186-H1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, 2-DG was shown to substantially reduce ischemic brain injury (17Yu Z.F. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, long term use of high dose 2-DG in rats can cause cardiac injury, casting doubt on the potential of 2-DG being used as a CR mimetic to prolong life in animals (18Minor R.K. Smith Jr., D.L. Sossong A.M. Kaushik S. Poosala S. Spangler E.L. Roth G.S. Lane M. Allison D.B. de Cabo R. Ingram D.K. Mattison J.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2010; 243: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) despite evidence that 2-DG can significantly extend the life span in Caenorhabditis elegans (19Schulz T.J. Zarse K. Voigt A. Urban N. Birringer M. Ristow M. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Regardless of this discrepancy, it remains formally possible that 2-DG may produce beneficial effects on the heart under more acute conditions such as ischemia/reperfusion and chemotherapy-induced cardiac damage. The anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin (DOX) is a highly effective antitumor agent with a remarkably wide spectrum of activity in human cancers. However, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity of DOX that culminates in congestive heart failure has limited its use in cancer patients (20Minotti G. Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Cairo G. Gianni L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 185-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar, 21Singal P.K. Iliskovic N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 22Swain S.M. Whaley F.S. Ewer M.S. Cancer. 2003; 97: 2869-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remain incompletely understood, but most studies suggest oxidative stress as a convergent mechanism responsible for its pathogenesis. In animal studies, several compounds with antioxidant properties have been shown to reduce DOX cardiotoxicity to some degree (23Sun X. Zhou Z. Kang Y.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3382-3387PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Yu A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Epstein P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12610-12616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, clinical trials have failed to reproduce these results in humans (26Ladas E.J. Jacobson J.S. Kennedy D.D. Teel K. Fleischauer A. Kelly K.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), suggesting that mechanisms other than oxidative stress might also contribute to DOX-induced heart failure. Thus, a comprehensive therapy that targets multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress, may be more efficacious to attenuate DOX cardiotoxicity. In this respect, CR triggers drastic changes in multiple signaling pathways that modulate diverse fundamental physiological processes (3Masoro E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1040-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Spindler S.R. Ageing Res. Rev. 2010; 9: 324-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to induce a general attenuation of oxidative damage (28Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar), inflammation (29Chung H.Y. Kim H.J. Kim J.W. Yu B.P. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (30Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Remarkably, CR has demonstrated an ability to eliminate the mortality and cardiac dysfunction in DOX-treated rats (31Mitra M.S. Donthamsetty S. White B. Latendresse J.R. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2007; 225: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the anticancer effect of CR, this result suggests that CR could be incorporated into a DOX-containing therapeutic regimen to increase the anticancer efficacy and at the same time to reduce cardiotoxicity in cancer patients. It is exactly in this context that a CR mimetic may be more feasible because cancer patients, at least those who are diagnosed late, may already suffer from malnutrition and cannot tolerate CR well. Expectedly, 2-DG has been shown to mimic the antitumor effects of CR. Indeed, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG was toxic to various tumor cells (32Zhang X.D. Deslandes E. Villedieu M. Poulain L. Duval M. Gauduchon P. Schwartz L. Icard P. Anticancer Res. 2006; 26: 3561-3566PubMed Google Scholar, 33Aft R.L. Zhang F.W. Gius D. Br. J.

Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004; 53: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). 2-DG can also enhance the anticancer efficacy of chemotherapy or radiotherapy and at the same time protect normal cells (35Dwarakanath B.S.

Jain V. Strahlenther Onkol. 2005; 181: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, chemotherapeutic regimens with 2-DG as a component have entered phase I/II clinical trials (36Dwarakanath B.S. Singh D. Banerji A.K. Sarin R. Venkataramana N.K. Jalali R. Vishwanath P.N.

Future Oncol. 2009; 5: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Importantly, 2-DG has been shown to enhance the antitumor activity of DOX in cell culture (42Zhang F. Aft R.L. J. Cancer Res. Ther. 2009; 5: S41-S43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in tumor-bearing mice (43Maschek G. Savaraj N. Priebe W. Braunschweiger P. Hamilton K. Tidmarsh G.F. De Young L.R. Lampidis T.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Given the potential cardiovascular benefits of 2-DG (15Ingram D.K. Roth G.S. Exp. Gerontol. 2011; 46: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Wan R. Camandola S. Mattson M.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1186-H1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), these data collectively suggest a viable chemotherapy strategy that uses 2-DG together with other anticancer drugs that have cardiotoxicity such as DOX. It would have a significant clinical impact if the combined use of 2-DG and DOX is proven to selectively destroy tumors while concurrently limiting cardiac damage. As an important step toward this end, we examined the ability of 2-DG to impact DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in cultured cardiomyocytes and explored the potential underlying mechanisms. Our results clearly established the proof-of-principle that the caloric restriction mimetic 2-DG can be used together with DOX to reduce cardiomyocyte injury. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRC) were cultured as described previously (44Kobayashi S. Volden P. Timm D. Mao K. Xu X. Liang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 793-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, NRC were isolated from 0- to 2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat neonates using trypsin and DNase. NRC were cultured on gelatinized dishes overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 15% bovine serum. The following day the media were switched to DMEM containing 2% bovine serum unless otherwise indicated. All media contain penicillin and streptomycin (100 units/ml) as well as 100 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma). BrdU was used to inhibit the growth of contaminating nonmyocytes, including fibroblasts. 2-DG, DOX, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), compound C (Cpd C), and propidium iodide (PI) were obtained from Sigma. Rapamycin and bafilomycin A1 (BFA) were obtained from LC laboratories. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. The following primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: cleaved caspase 3; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), AMPKα1, AMPKα2, phospho-AMPKα (Thr-172), AMPKβ1/2, phospho-AMPKβ1 (Ser-108); acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), phospho-ACC (Ser-79); Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-Akt (Thr-308); FoxO1, phospho-FoxO1(Thr-24)FoxO/3a (Thr-32); glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9); mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448); p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), phospho-p70S6K (Thr-389), S6 ribosomal protein (S6), phospho-S6 (Ser-235/236); microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3); autophagy-related 5 (Atg5), Atg7, Atg12; β-actin; elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2k), and phospho-eEF2k (Ser-366). We purchased primary antibodies against GATA4, Bcl2 and Beclin 1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The level of intracellular ATP was measured by using a colorimetric/fluorometric assay kit (Abcam, San Francisco). Briefly, cells were lysed in the ATP assay buffer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min to pellet insoluble materials. The supernatant was added to a 96-well plate and followed by the addition of 50 μl of the Reaction Mix to each well. The absorbance was read at 550 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader from Molecular Devices. The ATP content was calculated based on a standard curve generated at the same time. Constitutively active AMPKα2 (AdAMPK-CA) recombinant adenovirus was obtained from Eton Bioscience (San Diego). Adenovirus encoding GFP-LC3 (AdGFP-LC3) was kindly provided by Dr. Tolkovsky (45Bampton E.T. Goemans C.G. Niranjan D. Mizushima N. Tolkovsky A.M. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting rat beclin 1 mRNA (AdshBCN1) was created as described previously (44Kobayashi S. Volden P. Timm D. Mao K. Xu X. Liang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 793-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Control shRNA adenovirus (AdshCon) was generated by cloning a small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequence not having any predicted sequence matches to coding regions in mouse or rat genomes (46Kobayashi S. Lackey T. Huang Y. Bisping E. Pu W.T. Boxer L.M. Liang Q. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, cardiomyocytes were infected with each adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100 plaque-forming units for 2 hours (h). Following infection, cardiomyocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 2% bovine serum for an additional 24 h in the case of AdAMPK-CA and AdGFP-LC3, and 48 h in the case of AdshBCN1 and AdshCon before treatment with 2-DG and other drugs. The silencer select siRNAs targeting rat AMPKα1/AMPKα2 (catalog no. 4390815) and a silencer negative control siRNA 1 (catalog no. AM4635) were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). For transfection, cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at 0.7 × 106 cells per dish, grown for 24 h, and then transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and Opti-MEM in serum-free and antibiotic-free medium, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To concurrently knock down both α1 and α2 subunits of AMPK, cells were transfected with a mixture of the two siRNA with a final concentration of 50 nm for each. The concentrations of siRNAs were chosen based on dose-response studies. The media were replaced 24 h later with fresh 2% serum containing DMEM, and the cells were then treated with 2-DG or other drugs. Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer as described previously (47Kobayashi S. Mao K. Zheng H. Wang X. Patterson C. O'Connell T.D. Liang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21945-21952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The lysates (40–50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare), which was incubated with the primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Specific proteins were detected by chemiluminescent detection using an ECL Advanced Western blotting kit (GE Healthcare). Protein abundance on Western blots was quantified by densitometry with the Quantity One program from Bio-Rad. Cardiomyocyte death was measured by staining with PI (1 μg/ml) that was added directly to the culture media. PI enters dead cells through disrupted membranes to bind to DNA. Cardiomyocytes were photographed under both phase contrast and fluorescent conditions. The PI-positive cells (stained red) were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells (200–250 counted under phase contrast). DOX-induced apoptosis was determined by a DNA laddering assay and the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. For the DNA laddering assay, the cells were harvested, and DNA was extracted. A semiquantitative PCR-based DNA laddering kit from Maxim Biotech, Inc. (San Francisco), was used to assess the degree of apoptosis. Cleaved caspase 3 and PARP were determined by Western blot analysis. When autophagy was induced, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), an 18-kDa mammalian homolog of autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8), was processed from LC3-I to LC3-II and conjugated to the nascent autophagosome membrane. LC3-II remained associated with autophagic vacuoles (AVs) until degraded by lysosomal proteases (48Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). Therefore, autophagy can be measured by the amount of LC3-II formed. For detection of LC3-II, cells lysates were prepared, and 30 μg of total proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-LC3 antibody. To determine whether the accumulation of LC3-II was caused by an enhanced autophagosome formation rather than an impaired degradation, we measured the difference in LC3-II protein levels in the absence and presence of the lysosomal inhibitor BFA (50 nm). This difference is referred to as autophagic flux that reflects the number of AVs that are delivered to and degraded in the lysosome (49Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Additionally, autophagy has been routinely visualized by fluorescence imaging of the GFP-LC3 fusion protein that is transfected into cells (50Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). We infected cardiomyocytes with AdGFP-LC3 and performed the indicated experiments 24 h later. GFP-LC3 images were captured at ×600 using an FV1000 Olympus confocal microscope. For population analysis, cells were inspected at ×200 magnification, and the positive cells were expressed as the percentage of cells that have >25 GFP-LC3 dots (representing AVs) over the number of total GFP-expressing cells examined. At least 200 cells were scored in each of five or more independent experiments. BFA was also used in GFP-LC3 related experiments to assess autophagic flux. Quantitative data were presented as the means ± S.E. Differences between experimental groups were examined by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post test using Prism software (GraphPad). For all analyses, p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Numerous studies have suggested cardiomyocyte death, including both apoptosis and necrosis as one of the most prominent features of DOX-induced cardiac toxicity (51Zhang Y.W. Shi J. Li Y.J. Wei L. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 2009; 57: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here, we evaluated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death by using PI staining, which estimates the number of dead cells regardless of the cause of death, and apoptosis, which was determined by DNA laddering and cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. 2-DG reproduced the beneficial effects of CR in several animal models (12Ingram D.K. Zhu M. Mamczarz J. Zou S. Lane M.A. Roth G.S. deCabo R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 14Ingram D.K. Anson R.M. de Cabo R. Mamczarz J. Zhu M. Mattison J. Lane M.A. Roth G.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and was able to attenuate DOX induced apoptosis in the mouse small intestinal epithelium (52Thakkar N.S. Potten C.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2057-2060PubMed Google Scholar). To test if 2-DG can affect DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death, we pretreated NRC (cultured in DMEM with 2% bovine serum) with 500 μm 2-DG (an effective dose determined in pilot studies) for 24 h. DOX (1 μm) was then added, and the cells were cultured for another 16 h. As expected, DOX treatment led to increased PI-positive cells (Fig. 1, A and B), enhanced DNA laddering (Fig. 1C), and increased cleavage of caspase 3 (cCasp3) and PARP (Fig. 1D). Although 500 μm 2-DG did not have any effect at base line, it substantially attenuated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death as indicated by reduced PI-positive cells (from 36.8 ± 5.4 to 14.8 ± 2.7, n = 4, p < 0.01, Fig. 1, A and B), attenuated DNA laddering (Fig. 1C), and decreased cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 1D). These results confirmed the ability of 2-DG to reduce DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. 2-DG mimics CR by competitively inhibiting glucose usage, thereby affecting cellular energy metabolism. We assessed the impact of 500 μm 2-DG on intracellular ATP levels. As shown in Fig. 2A, 2-DG treatment resulted in a 17.9% reduction in ATP content compared with saline control (from 3.66 ± 0.15 to 3.01 ± 0.22, n = 6, p < 0.05), consistent with its role as a CR mimetic. DOX cardiotoxicity has been attributed at least partly to ATP depletion (53Pointon A.V. Walker T.M. Phillips K.M. Luo J. Riley J. Zhang S.D. Parry J.D. Lyon J.J. Marczylo E.L. Gant T.W. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12733Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and CR is able to mitigate DOX-induced cardiac damage and ATP depletion (31Mitra M.S. Donthamsetty S. White B. Latendresse J.R. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2007; 225: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that similar to CR, 2-DG may antagonize DOX cardiotoxicity through improved ATP homeostasis. To test this possibility, we treated cardiomyocytes with DOX and 2-DG either individually or in combination, and then measured the ATP contents. As shown in Fig. 2B, despite its ability to moderately reduce ATP concentration (by 17.9%), 2-DG completely prevented DOX-induced ATP depletion (DOX 36.7% versus 2-DG + DOX 17.1%, n = 6, p < 0.01). This result is in line with an earlier study in which 2-DG-induced reduction in ATP levels protected renal proximal tubule cells against a more severe ATP depletion during ischemia (54Lee H.T. Emala C.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2753-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In summary, one mechanism by which 2-DG reduces DOX cardiotoxicity may be attributable to its ability to prevent DOX-induced ATP depletion. To further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of 2-DG, we determined if 2-DG can mimic CR to affect several important signaling pathways in cultured NRC. Cardiomyocytes were treated with 2-DG for 40 h and then harvested for Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, 2-DG reduced the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473 and Thr-308) and its downstream effectors FoxO1 (Thr-24) and GSK3β (Ser-9), suggesting that 2-DG largely inhibited Akt signaling. Similarly, 2-DG suppressed mTOR signaling as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of mTOR downstream targets S6K (Thr-389) and S6 (Ser-235). Given the pro-survival nature of Akt and mTOR, the inhibition of these two pathways may not be directly responsible for 2-DG-induced cardioprotective effects. By contrast, 2-DG markedly enhanced the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as shown by the increased phosphorylation of AMPKα (Thr-172), AMPKβ (Ser-108), and its downstream target ACC (Ser-79). AMPK is a highly conserved heterotrimeric protein kinase composed of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits (β and γ). AMPK is an energy sensor that can be activated by reduced ATP or increased AMP content. Importantly, AMPK has been shown to protect the heart under various conditions such as ischemia (55Matsui Y. Takagi H. Qu X. Abdellatif M. Sakoda H. Asano T. Levine B. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 56Nagata D. Hirata Y. Hypertens.

Thus, the fact that 2-DG activates AMPK suggests that AMPK may mediate 2-DG-induced cardioprotection. To test if AMPK plays a role in 2-DG-induced survival, we treated NRC with 5 μm compound C (Cpd C), a commonly used AMPK inhibitor"
https://openalex.org/W2079014348,"The extracellular effect of fibroblast growth factor-12 (FGF12) remains unknown because FGF12 cannot activate any fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and FGF12 is not currently thought to be released from cells. We reported previously that FGF12 plays an intracellular role in the inhibition of radiation-induced apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that recombinant FGF12 was able to be internalized into the cytoplasm of a rat intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC6, and this process was dependent on two novel cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) domains (CPP-M and CPP-C). In particular, CPP-C, composed of ∼10 amino acids, was identified as a specific domain of FGF12 and its subfamily in the C-terminal region (residues 140-149), although CPP-M was a common domain in the internal region of the FGF family. The absence of CPP-C from FGF12 or a mutation (E142L) in the CPP-C domain drastically reduced the internalization of FGF12 into cells. Therefore, CPP-C played an essential role in the internalization of FGF12. In addition, CPP-C was able to deliver other polypeptides into cells as a CPP because an FGF1/CPP-C chimeric protein was internalized into IEC6 cells more efficiently than wild-type FGF1. Finally, intraperitoneally added FGF12 inhibited radiation-induced apoptosis in the intestinal epithelial cells of BALB/c mice, and deletion of the CPP-C domain decreased the inhibition of the apoptosis. These findings suggest that exogenous FGF12 can play a role in tissues by translocating into cells through the plasma membrane, and the availability of this novel CPP provides a new tool for the intracellular delivery of bioactive molecules."

Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Plasminogen receptors and activators are expressed by group A, C, and G streptococci (18Lähteenmäki K. Kuusela P. Korhonen T.K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 531-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). GAS interact with plasminogen either by direct binding with specific surface proteins or indirectly by sequential binding of fibrinogen and plasminogen (19Lottenberg R. Broder C.C. Boyle M.D. Kain S.J. Schroeder B.L. Curtiss 3rd, R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5204-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific GAS surface proteins involved in plasminogen-binding are glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH (20Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. von Mering G.O. Johnston K.H. Boyle M.D. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)), and extracellular protein factor (Epf (26Kreikemeyer B. Nakata M. Köller T. Hildisch H. Kourakos V. Standar K. Kawabata S. Glocker M.O. Podbielski A. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5698-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Moreover, the GAS-secreted nephritogenic plasminogen-binding protein is able to interact with plasminogen (27Poon-King R. Bannan J. Viteri A. Cu G. Zabriskie J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Another secreted protein, streptokinase, enables GAS to cleave plasminogen to plasmin (18Lähteenmäki K. Kuusela P. Korhonen T.K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 531-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), which degrades connective tissue, extracellular matrix (ECM), and fibrin clots (16Danø K. Andreasen P.A.

Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The redundancy of these secreted and surface-associated GAS plasminogen receptors implies a crucial role of plasminogen binding in GAS pathogenesis. This is underlined by the fact that GAS-plasminogen interaction promotes tissue invasion (28Boyle M.D. Lottenberg R. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29Khil J. Im M. Heath A. Ringdahl U. Mundada L. Cary Engleberg N. Fay W.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The exploitation of the human plasminogen systems plays a critical role in GAS systemic disease initiation (30Cole J.N. McArthur J.D. McKay F.C. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Cork A.J. Ranson M. Rohde M. Itzek A. Sun H. Ginsburg D. Kotb M. Nizet V. Chhatwal G.S. Walker M.J.

FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), most likely by allowing GAS to circumvent host defense fibrin networks (32McArthur J.D. McKay F.C. Ramachandran V. Shyam P. Cork A.J. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Cole J.N. Ringdahl U. Sjöbring U. Ranson M. Walker M.J. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3146-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been shown that coating of GAS with plasminogen enhances adherence to Detroit laryngeal epithelial cells and allows transwell penetration through the monolayers by mechanisms not well defined yet (33Pancholi V. Fontan P. Jin H. Microb. Pathog. 2003; 35: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, also a direct binding of SDH to urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR/CD87) on the surface of Detroit cells has been described (22Jin H. Song Y.P. Boel G. Kochar J. Pancholi V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Together, these data strongly suggested plasminogen binding to be important for GAS infections through the naso-pharyngeal route. At least the expression of one bacterial receptor, PAM, was found associated with skin infection (34McKay F.C. McArthur J.D. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Gardam S. Currie B.J. Sriprakash K.S. Fagan P.K. Towers R.J. Batzloff M.R. Chhatwal G.S. Ranson M. Walker M.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This leaves the major questions how GAS use surface bound plasminogen/plasmin to adhere to and internalize into skin keratinocytes, a primary event during the skin infection route, what is the nature of the host cell receptor for plasminogen/plasmin on keratinocytes, and which intracellular signaling pathways are exploited for these processes. To address these open questions we used chemical inhibitors and siRNA silencing to characterize the observed high level keratinocyte invasion by GAS once they are coated with plasminogen/plasmin. These effects can be achieved by intact surface-bound plasminogen as shown with a streptokinase-negative GAS mutant. If, under physiological conditions, plasminogen is cleaved into active plasmin on the bacterial surface, the increased internalization is independent of the serine protease activity of plasmin as we were able to show by aprotinin and α2-antiplasmin inhibition experiments. Because we cannot completely rule out conversion of plasminogen into active plasmin once it is bound to the bacterial surface, we refer to the surface-bound material as plasminogen/plasmin throughout this work. Integrins were identified as binding partners on the keratinocyte surface for plasminogen/plasmin interaction. Inhibition of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics and genetic knock-down of ILK impaired plasminogen/plasmin-mediated GAS keratinocyte invasion. GAS surface-bound plasminogen/plasmin enhanced bacterial blood survival and protected against macrophage killing. Human plasminogen was purchased from Chromogenix and was detected using a monoclonal murine Anti-PLG antibody (Sigma). Cytocalasin D, Wortmannin, Latrunculin B, Akt 1/2 kinase inhibitor, aprotinin, and heparin (sodium salt) were obtained from Sigma. α2-antiplasmin was purchased from antikoerper-online.de. Highly purified whole human integrins αvβ5, α1β1, and α5β1 were obtained from Millipore. SignalSilence ILK1 siRNA, SignalSilence Control siRNA, PI3 Kinase Class III (D4E2) XP Rabbit mAb, Phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody, ILK1 antibody, GAPDH (14C10) Rabbit mAb, and anti-rabbit IgG AP-linked antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. CSPD ready to use was obtained from Roche. LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity kit for mammalian cells was purchased from Invitrogen. In transfection experiments Transpass R2 reagent (NEB) was used. GAS serotype M49 strain 591 was obtained from R. Lütticken (Aachen, Germany). The GAS wild-type strain was cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (THY; Invitrogen) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2-20% O2 atmosphere. A streptokinase-deficient mutant in the GAS M49 chromosomal background was generated by insertional inactivation of the ska gene (data not shown). After plasminogen binding to the mutant surface no plasmin activity above background could be detected (data not shown). The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (Deutsches Krebsforschungszemtrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg) was used for standard adherence and internalization assays. The keratinocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) GlutaMAXTM-I, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) in tissue culture flasks (Greiner) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2-20% O2 atmosphere (35Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). The mouse monocytes-macrophages J-774A.1 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DMSZ), DMSZ no.: ACC170) were used for quantitative phagocytosis assays. The cells were routinely maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Invitrogen) in tissue culture flasks (Greiner) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2-20% O2 atmosphere. For all experiments investigating the effects of plasminogen/plasmin human and murine cells were cultured and subsequently infected with bacteria under serum-free conditions. This prevented the potential presence of exogenous plasminogen and other plasma and matrix proteins (particularly fibronectin) in the assays and allowed investigation of the behavior of plasminogen/plasmin-coated bacteria. Transfections of HaCaT cells with siRNA were promoted with Transpass R2 reagent according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Adherence to and internalization into HaCaT cells was performed in serum-free conditions and quantified using the antibiotic protection assay (36Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F. Fässler R. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). 24-well plates were inoculated with 2.5 × 105 cells per well in DMEM medium without antibiotics. Cells were allowed to grow to confluence. For the assay, cells were washed with DMEM, and infected with GAS M49 at a multiplicity of infection of 1:10 in DMEM. Two hours after infection, cells were washed extensively with PBS, detached from the wells by trypsin treatment, and lysed with sterile distilled water. The viable counts of GAS (colony forming units (CFU)) released from the lysed cells were determined by serial dilution in PBS and plating on THY agar. For the assessment of bacterial internalization, 2 h after infection the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with DMEM supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (5 mg/ml) for additional 2 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed and lysed and the GAS viable counts were determined as described above. The percentage of attached or internalized bacteria was calculated by relation to the initial inoculum. To elucidate the effect of bacteria-bound plasminogen/plasmin on adherence and internalization, GAS were incubated for 30 min with human plasminogen (2 μg/ml) at room temperature prior to the adherence and internalization assay. Unbound plasminogen/plasmin was removed by washing the bacteria once with PBS. In inhibition experiments, the plasminogen precoated bacteria were additionally incubated with 2 μg/ml of purified integrins (αvβ5, α1β1, and α5β1) for 15 min or with heparin at room temperature. Unbound integrins or heparin were removed by washing the bacteria once with PBS. To rule out effects of plasmin serine protease activity, the adherence and internalization assay was additionally performed in the presence of plasmin inhibitors aprotinin and α2-antiplasmin (2 μg/ml). The pharmacological inhibitors used to study the impact of the cytoskeleton or signaling molecules were solved in DMSO. The HaCaT cells were preincubated with the inhibitors for 30 min prior to the infection with GAS. The assay was performed in the presence of the inhibitors. As a control, the cells were preincubated with DMSO at the same concentrations and infected with the bacteria (37Bergmann S. Lang A. Rohde M. Agarwal V. Rennemeier C. Grashoff C. Preissner K.T. Hammerschmidt S. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All inhibition experiments were performed in DMEM without FBS supplementation. The quantitative phagocytosis assay was carried out as described by Hampton and Winterbourn (38Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures of GAS were inoculated into fresh THY medium and grown to exponential growth phase. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and set to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.0, followed by opsonization of 1 × 107/ml of the bacteria in HBSS (10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose) containing 10% (v/v) human serum. The opsonized bacteria were incubated with monocytes/macrophages at a ratio of 1:1 for 30 min at 37 °C and slight shaking. The suspension was then harvested by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min, and the cell sediment was washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The supernatants were collected. For lysis of the moncytes/macrophages the final pellet was suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing saponin (0.05% (w/v)) and homogenized until no visible aggregates remained. Finally, the viable counts of inoculated bacteria, supernatants (extracellular bacteria), and homogenized phagocyte solution (intracellular bacteria) were determined by plating serial dilutions and related to the initial inoculum, which was set to 100%. The blood survival assay was performed as described by Nakata et al. (39Nakata M. Köller T. Moritz K. Ribardo D. Jonas L. McIver K.S. Sumitomo T. Terao Y. Kawabata S. Podbielski A. Kreikemeyer B. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures of GAS were inoculated into fresh THY medium and grown to exponential growth phase. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, set to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.25, and further diluted 1:10,000 in PBS. The viable counts of this suspension were determined by plating serial dilutions on THY agar plates. 20 μl of the suspension were incubated with 480 μl of heparinized blood for 3 h at 37 °C with rotation. After this incubation, the remaining CFU were determined by plating and related to the initial inoculum. The plasminogen binding assays with intact bacteria were performed by using a method adapted from Ringdahl et al. (40Ringdahl U. Svensson M. Wistedt A.C. Renné T. Kellner R. Müller-Esterl W. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6424-6430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures grown in THY medium were washed in PBS and suspended in one-tenth of the original volume using PBS. 100 μl of cells, equivalent to 108 CFUs, were added to 4 ml of PBS (negative control) or to 4 ml of PBS supplemented with human plasminogen (2 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 4 °C. The bacterial pellets were washed in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and placed on ice. Plasmin activity associated with the bacteria was measured using a method adapted from Kulisek et al. (41Kulisek E.S. Holm S.E. Johnston K.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Each pellet was incubated in 100 μl of plasmin substrate solution (2 volumes of chromogenic substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-ρ-nitroanilide (Sigma) stock solution (0.5 mg/ml in water) and 3 volumes of 32 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.77 m NaCl solution) for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by absorbance measurement at 405 nm. To show the ability of the bacteria to bind plasminogen, GAS M49 were incubated for 30 min with human plasminogen (2 μg/ml) at room temperature prior to the washing step with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The untreated and treated bacteria, plasminogen and fibronectin were transferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. After drying, the membrane was blocked with 5% (v/v) skim milk prior to antibody incubations. Antibody incubations were performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Host cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, pH 7.4 containing protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). Lysis was performed on ice for 30 min. Protein lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The amount of protein in the samples was determined using the Bradford protein quantification method (Bio-Rad). Lysates were normalized to equal amounts of protein and boiled in sample buffer consisting of 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. As molecular mass marker, prestained protein standards were used (Bio-Rad). The protein lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% (v/v) skim milk prior to antibody incubations. Antibody incubations were performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The significance of differences between samples in plasminogen/plasmin binding, adherence, and internalization assays was determined using the two-tailed U test. p < 0.05 was defined as marginally significant. p < 0.01 was defined as significant, and p < 0.001 was defined as highly significant. Results are demonstrated as averages and S.D. (n ≥ 5). To investigate a possible link between plasminogen/plasmin-binding capacity and serotypes of S. pyogenes, different clinical isolates from invasive diseases and uncomplicated infections were tested. We determined the streptococcal surface plasmin (serine protease) activity after pretreatment of the bacteria with Glu-plasminogen as a measure for the surface-bound plasminogen. Serine protease activity of untreated GAS was measured as background control. Not unexpected, a considerable level of protease activity was noted due to the expression of several other GAS proteases. Plasminogen-coated serotypes M1, M2, M4, M28, and M49 bacteria showed a high level of plasmin activity on their surface (Fig. 1A). This assay revealed that the tested GAS serotypes are capable of binding plasminogen, which, once bound on the bacterial surface, can be converted to plasmin within the 4 h of incubation (coating time plus plasmin-assay time). This conversion is most likely achieved by streptokinase, thus it cannot be ruled out that the determined values rather reflect different amounts of secreted streptokinase in the different GAS serotypes. To prove and detect surface localization of the plasminogen/plasmin recruited by GAS, we performed dot blot analysis with serotype M49 bacteria. The detection of surface-bound plasminogen was performed with a monoclonal anti-PLG antibody (Fig. 1B). Plasminogen/plasmin-binding is important for adherence of GAS to Detroit laryngeal epithelial cells, suggesting a role in the nasopharyngeal infection route (33Pancholi V. Fontan P. Jin H. Microb. Pathog. 2003; 35: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To study the effect of plasminogen/plasmin on the adherence to and internalization into human keratinocytes, a relevant step during GAS skin infection, HaCaT cells were infected with different plasminogen/plasmin-coated and uncoated GAS serotypes. Supplemental Fig. S1, A and B show the results. All tested serotypes showed increased adherence to HaCaT cells. The interesting result was that serotypes M4 and M49 showed also an increased internalization into human keratinocytes. Of note, the S. pyogenes serotype M49, derived from a skin infection, exhibited the highest plasmin activity on its surface and showed an increased adherence to keratinocytes (Fig. 1C). More important, a 50% increase in keratinocyte internalization was noted for pretreated bacteria compared with untreated controls (Fig. 1D). From this knowledge, we decided to use this serotype for further studies. To exclude the possibility that these observations resulted from activation of plasminogen to plasmin, the adherence and internalization assay was performed in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and the specific plasmin inhibitor α2-antiplasmin. Again, plasminogen/plasmin-treated GAS M49 showed increased adherence to and internalization into human HaCaT cells (Fig. 1, C and D). To ask whether intact plasminogen was able to mediate this effect, we performed the adherence and internalization assay with a streptokinase deficient mutant of GAS M49 (ska−). Again, the same effects could be observed (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). In addition, the supernatants of untreated and treated HaCaT cells, the bacteria alone and in co-cultivation showed no plasmin activity (supplemental Fig. S1E). This suggested lack of any secreted products which can activate plasminogen into plasmin under our experimental conditions. These experiments indicate that plasminogen/plasmin-binding of GAS M49 leads to an enhanced host cell adherence and internalization. This effect is based on the surface bound plasminogen/plasmin molecules, and is independent of putative plasminogen cleavage into plasmin and the presence of active serine protease activity in the assays. To investigate the specificity of the GAS surface-bound plasminogen/plasmin-host cell interaction we performed inhibition experiments. Serrano et al. (42Serrano R.L. Rodriguez P. Pizzo S.V. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) described heparin as a potential inhibitor of plasminogen. Thus, we next tested heparin for the ability to inhibit (I) the development of plasmin activity after GAS surface plasminogen binding, and (II) the attachment on and internalization into HaCaT cells of coated GAS. Again, without plasminogen/plasmin-coating GAS M49 showed only background levels of plasmin activity on their surface, which was not further inhibited by heparin treatment (white bars, Fig. 2A). The plasmin activity on the surface of plasminogen-coated GAS M49 was completely (100%) blocked by heparin (gray bars, Fig. 2A). Heparin treatment of plasminogen-free GAS M49 did not influence HaCaT cell adherence and internalization (white bars, Fig. 2, B and C). However, pretreated GAS M49 adherence to HaCaT cells was noticeably decreased (gray bars, Fig. 2B), and HaCaT cell internalization was almost abolished by heparin inhibition (gray bars, Fig. 2C). These results allowed two conclusions. First, other non-plasminogen/plasmin binding-related and heparin-inhibited internalization mechanisms contribute to the overall capacity of GAS M49 to invade into HaCaT cells. Second, a significant proportion of GAS HaCaT cell adherence and internalization is dependent on plasminogen recruited to the bacterial surface. Next we sought to identify the HaCaT cell receptor, which recognizes the GAS surface-bound plasminogen. It is known that immobilized plasminogen supports cell adhesion by interacting with integrins on the surface of monocytoid U937 cells, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK), and also neutrophiles (43Chavakis T. Preissner K.T. Hamostaseologie. 2005; 25: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 44Lishko V.K. Novokhatny V.V. Yakubenko V.P. Skomorovska-Prokvolit H.V. Ugarova T.P. Blood. 2004; 104: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is also known that the kringle domain of the urokinase-like plasminogen activator (uPA) interacts with cell adhesion receptors of the integrin superfamily, including subfamilies α1, α5, and β1 subunit (45Wei Y.

https://openalex.org/W2025439263,"The tumor microenvironment is emerging as an important target for cancer therapy. Fibroblasts (Fbs) within the tumor stroma are critically involved in promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis through secretion of soluble factors, synthesis of extracellular matrix and direct cell-cell interaction. In this work, we aim to alter the biological activity of stromal Fbs by modulating the Notch1 signaling pathway. We show that Fbs engineered to constitutively activate the Notch1 pathway significantly inhibit melanoma growth and tumor angiogenesis. We determine that the inhibitory effect of 'Notch-engineered' Fbs is mediated by increased secretion of Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1) as the effects of Notch1 activation in Fbs are reversed by shRNA-mediated blockade of WISP-1. When 'Notch-engineered' Fbs are co-grafted with melanoma cells in SCID mice, shRNA-mediated blockade of WISP-1 reverses the tumor-suppressive phenotype of the 'Notch-engineered' Fbs, significantly increases melanoma growth and tumor angiogenesis. Consistent with these findings, supplement of recombinant WISP-1 protein inhibits melanoma cell growth in vitro. In addition, WISP-1 is modestly expressed in melanoma-activated Fbs but highly expressed in inactivated Fbs. Evaluation of human melanoma skin biopsies indicates that expression of WISP-1 is significantly lower in melanoma nests and surrounding areas filled with infiltrated immune cells than in the adjacent dermis unaffected by the melanoma. Overall, our study shows that constitutive activation of the Notch1 pathway confers Fbs with a suppressive phenotype to melanoma growth, partially through WISP-1. Thus, targeting tumor stromal Fbs by activating Notch signaling and/or increasing WISP-1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to combat melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2027792462,"The transfer of ubiquitin (Ub) to a substrate protein requires a cascade of E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligating enzymes. E3 Ub ligases containing U-box and RING domains bind both E2∼Ub conjugates and substrates to facilitate transfer of the Ub molecule. Although the overall mode of action of E3 ligases is well established, many of the mechanistic details that determine the outcome of ubiquitination are poorly understood. CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) is a U-box E3 ligase that serves as a co-chaperone to heat shock proteins and is critical for the regulation of unfolded proteins in the cytosol. We have performed a systematic analysis of the interactions of CHIP with E2 conjugating enzymes and found that only a subset bind and function. Moreover, some E2 enzymes function in pairs to create products that neither create individually. Characterization of the products of these reactions showed that different E2 enzymes produce different ubiquitination products, i.e. that E2 determines the outcome of Ub transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis on the E2 enzymes Ube2D1 and Ube2L3 (UbcH5a and UbcH7) established that an SPA motif in loop 7 of E2 is required for binding to CHIP but is not sufficient for activation of the E2∼Ub conjugate and consequent ubiquitination activity. These data support the proposal that the E2 SPA motif provides specificity for binding to CHIP, whereas activation of the E2∼Ub conjugate is derived from other molecular determinants."
https://openalex.org/W2089036615,"Although both the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and the activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) have been shown to promote cell survival of transformed cells but not survival of non-transformed cells, the relationship of the two molecules is unknown. Here we show that HSP70 and ATF5 are concomitantly up-regulated upon transient but down-regulated over prolonged cellular stress and apoptotic stimulation in the rat C6 glioma and human U87 glioma cells. HSP70 interacts strongly with the N-terminal activation domain of ATF5, which is expected to be rigid and uniquely structured under physiological conditions because of extraordinary high concentration (over 25%) of proline residues. Binding of HSP70 to ATF5 is an ATP-driven process and requires functional ATPase on the nucleotide binding domain of the HSP70 molecule. Overexpression of HSP70 dramatically stabilizes the ATF5 protein, which is otherwise subject to rapid degradation, facilitated by both proteasome-dependent and caspase-dependent processes, whereas HSP70 depletion leads to acceleration of ATF5 degradation and transcription repression of Bcl-2 and Egr-1, which are downstream targets of ATF5 in C6 and U87 glioma cells. Our data reveal an essential role for HSP70 in maintaining high levels of ATF5 expression in glioma cells and support the conclusion that ATF5 is an important substrate protein of HSP70 that mediates HSP70-promoted cell survival in glioma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2128175377,"Reduced axonal mitochondrial transport has been observed in major neurodegenerative diseases, including fALS patients and SOD1G93A mice. However, it is unclear whether this defect plays a critical role in axonal degeneration or simply reflects sequelae of general transport alteration. Using genetic mouse models combined with time-lapse imaging of live neurons, we previously discovered that axon-targeted syntaphilin (SNPH) acts as a docking receptor specific for axonal mitochondria. Deletion of the snph gene in mice results in a substantially higher proportion of axonal mitochondria in the mobile state without any effect on the transport of other axonal organelles. Here we address whether increased (rescued) axonal mitochondrial mobility changes the disease course by crossing fALS-linked transgenic SOD1G93A and snph−/− knock-out mice. We found that a 2-fold increase in axonal mitochondrial mobility in SOD1G93A/snph−/− mice did not affect the onset of ALS-like symptoms. Both SOD1G93A and SOD1G93A/snph−/− mice exhibit similar weight loss, deterioration in motor function and motor neuron loss, significant gliosis, and a lifespan of 152–154 days. Thus, for the first time, our study provides genetic and pathological evidence that the impairment of mitochondrial transport seen in SOD1G93A mice plays a minimal role in the rapid-onset of fALS-linked pathology. Reduced axonal mitochondrial transport has been observed in major neurodegenerative diseases, including fALS patients and SOD1G93A mice. However, it is unclear whether this defect plays a critical role in axonal degeneration or simply reflects sequelae of general transport alteration. Using genetic mouse models combined with time-lapse imaging of live neurons, we previously discovered that axon-targeted syntaphilin (SNPH) acts as a docking receptor specific for axonal mitochondria. Deletion of the snph gene in mice results in a substantially higher proportion of axonal mitochondria in the mobile state without any effect on the transport of other axonal organelles. Here we address whether increased (rescued) axonal mitochondrial mobility changes the disease course by crossing fALS-linked transgenic SOD1G93A and snph−/− knock-out mice.

Here, we use a Drosophila tumor model to identify genes, which are specifically required for tumor growth. We found that reduction of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity resulted in very small tumors while only slightly affecting growth of wild-type tissue. The observed inhibition on tumor growth occurred at the level of cell-cycle progression. We conclude that tumor cells become dependent on PI3K function and that reduction of PI3K activity synthetically interferes with tumor growth. The results presented here broaden our insights into the intricate mechanisms underling tumorigenesis and illustrate the power of Drosophila genetics in revealing weak points of tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2055866442,"Reversible modulation of integrin-regulated cell-matrix adhesion and epithelial (E)-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion plays a critical role in the establishment of ovarian cancer metastases. In contrast to most epithelial cell-derived tumors that down-regulate E-cadherin expression during progression, acquisition of E-cadherin expression accompanies malignant transformation of the ovarian surface epithelium and is maintained in peritoneal metastases. Metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer cells are disseminated intraperitoneally and preferentially adhere via integrins to interstitial collagens in the peritoneal cavity. This study was undertaken to determine whether integrin engagement influences E-cadherin and β-catenin localization and function. The data demonstrate that multivalent integrin engagement results in increased internalization of E-cadherin, inhibition of GSK-3β, elevated levels of nuclear β-catenin, increased β-catenin-regulated promoter activation, and transcriptional activation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Blocking β-catenin transcriptional control with inhibitor of β-catenin and Tcf-4 reduces cellular invasion, suggesting a key role for β-catenin nuclear signaling in EOC invasion and metastasis. These studies support a model wherein cell-matrix engagement regulates the functional integrity of cell-cell contacts, leading to increased β-catenin nuclear signaling and enhanced cellular invasive activity. Furthermore, these results provide a mechanism for activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the absence of activating mutations in this pathway."

Hepatocytes from MKP-1-deficient mice exhibited reduced PPARγ-induced lipid droplet formation. Mechanistically, loss of MKP-1 inhibited PPARγ function by increasing MAPK-dependent phosphorylation on PPARγ at its inhibitory residue of serine 112. These results demonstrate that in addition to inhibiting hepatic fatty acid oxidation, MKP-1 promotes hepatic lipogenic gene expression through PPARγ.

However, KLF8-interacting proteins remain largely unidentified. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), mass spectrometry, and GST pulldown assays, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a novel KLF8-interacting protein. Co-IP and Western blotting indicated that KLF8 is also a PARP-1 substrate. Mutation of the cysteines in the zinc finger domain of KLF8 abolished PARP-1 interaction. Surprisingly, immunofluorescent staining revealed a cytoplasmic mislocalization of KLF8 in PARP-1(-/-) cells or when the interaction was disrupted. This mislocalization was prevented by either PARP-1 re-expression or inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Interestingly, co-IP indicated competition between PARP-1 and CRM1 for KLF8 binding. Cycloheximide chase assay showed a decrease in the half-life of KLF8 protein when PARP-1 expression was suppressed or KLF8-PARP-1 interaction was disrupted. Ubiquitination assays implicated KLF8 as a target of ubiquitination that was significantly higher in PARP-1(-/-) cells. Promoter reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that KLF8 activation on the cyclin D1 promoter was markedly reduced when PARP-1 was deleted or inhibited or when KLF8-PARP-1 interaction was disrupted. Overall, this work has identified PARP-1 as a novel KLF8-binding and -regulating protein and provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of KLF8 nuclear localization, stability, and functions."

https://openalex.org/W2028943315,"Corin is a cardiac serine protease that activates natriuretic peptides. It consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region with a C-terminal trypsin-like protease domain. The transmembrane domain anchors corin on the surface of cardiomyocytes. To date, the function of the corin cytoplasmic tail remains unknown. By examining the difference between human and mouse corin cytoplasmic tails, analyzing their gene sequences, and verifying mRNA expression in hearts, we show that both human and mouse corin genes have alternative exons encoding different cytoplasmic tails. Human corin isoforms E1 and E1a have 45 and 15 amino acids, respectively, in their cytoplasmic tails. In transfected HEK 293 cells and HL-1 cardiomyocytes, corin isoforms E1 and E1a were expressed at similar levels. Compared with isoform E1a, however, isoform E1 was more active in processing natriuretic peptides. By cell surface labeling, glycosidase digestion, Western blotting, and flow cytometry, we found that corin isoform E1 was activated more readily as a result of more efficient cell surface targeting. By mutagenesis, we identified a DDNN motif in the cytoplasmic tail of isoform E1 (which is absent in isoform E1a) that promotes corin surface targeting in both HEK 293 and HL-1 cells. Our data indicate that the sequence in the cytoplasmic tail plays an important role in corin cell surface targeting and zymogen activation."

The crystallographic structure of PEB4 at 2.2-Å resolution reveals a dimer with distinct SurA-like chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) domains encasing a large central cavity. Unlike SurA, the chaperone domain is formed by interlocking helices from each monomer, creating a domain-swapped architecture. PEB4 stimulated the rate of proline isomerization limited refolding of denatured RNase T(1) in a juglone-sensitive manner, consistent with parvulin-like PPIase domains. Refolding and aggregation of denatured rhodanese was significantly retarded in the presence of PEB4 or of an engineered variant specifically lacking the PPIase domain, suggesting the chaperone domain possesses a holdase activity. Using bioinformatics approaches, we identified two other SurA-like proteins (Cj1289 and Cj0694) in C. jejuni. The 2.3-Å structure of Cj1289 does not have the domain-swapped architecture of PEB4 and thus more resembles SurA. Purified Cj1289 also enhanced RNase T(1) refolding, although poorly compared with PEB4, but did not retard the refolding of denatured rhodanese. Structurally, Cj1289 is the most similar protein to SurA in C. jejuni, whereas PEB4 has most structural similarity to the Par27 protein of Bordetella pertussis. Our analysis predicts that Cj0694 is equivalent to the membrane-anchored chaperone PpiD.

We report here that ADAM12 expression in cultured mammalian cells is up-regulated by Notch signals. Expression of a constitutively active form of Notch1 in murine fibroblasts, myoblasts, or mammary epithelial cells or activation of the endogenous Notch signaling by co-culture with ligand-expressing cells increases ADAM12 protein and mRNA levels. Up-regulation of ADAM12 expression by Notch requires new transcription, is activated in a CSL-dependent manner, and is abolished upon inhibition of IκB kinase. Expression of a constitutively active Notch1 in NIH3T3 cells increases the stability of Adam12 mRNA. We further show that the microRNA-29 family, which has a predicted conserved site in the 3'-untranslated region of mouse Adam12, plays a critical role in mediating the stimulatory effect of Notch on ADAM12 expression. In human cells, Notch up-regulates the expression of the long form, but not the short form, of ADAM12 containing a divergent 3'-untranslated mRNA region.

https://openalex.org/W1991177719,"CD38 catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a Ca(2+) messenger responsible for regulating a wide range of physiological functions. It is generally regarded as an ectoenzyme, but its intracellular localization has also been well documented. It is not known if internal CD38 is enzymatically active and contributes to the Ca(2+) signaling function. In this study, we engineered a novel soluble form of CD38 that can be efficiently expressed in the cytosol and use cytosolic NAD as a substrate to produce cADPR intracellularly. The activity of the engineered CD38 could be decreased by mutating the catalytic residue Glu-226 and increased by the double mutation E146A/T221F, which increased its cADPR synthesis activity by >11-fold. Remarkably, the engineered CD38 exhibited the ability to form the critical disulfide linkages required for its enzymatic activity. This was verified by using a monoclonal antibody generated against a critical disulfide, Cys-254-Cys-275. The specificity of the antibody was established by x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. The engineered CD38 is thus a novel example challenging the general belief that cytosolic proteins do not possess disulfides.

Heldin C.H. Development. 2009; 136: 3699-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Given their multifunctional nature, it is not surprising that TGF-β family activity is regulated at many levels, including the level of proteolytic activation (2Sopory S. Christian J.L. Whitman M. Sater A. Methods in Signal Transduction. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006: 37-60Google Scholar). All family members are synthesized as inactive precursor proteins consisting of an amino (N)-terminal prodomain followed by a carboxyl-terminal mature ligand domain. Precursor proteins dimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are cleaved by members of the proprotein convertase (PC) family of serine proteases. Cleavage occurs during transit through the biosynthetic pathway or outside of cells, and is required to generate a mature ligand that can bind and activate its cognate receptor.TGF-β ligands bind to a complex of transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, which activate signaling by phosphorylating receptor-regulated Smad proteins (R-Smads) (1Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Development. 2009; 136: 3699-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated R-Smads bind to the common mediator Smad, Smad4, and this protein complex then moves into the nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes. Although TGF-β ligands bind their receptors at the cell surface, endocytosis of activated receptors is required in most cases for intracellular signal transduction (3Chen Y.G. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 58-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Receptor-mediated endocytosis is not only required for TGF-β signal transduction, but it also plays an important role in signal termination by targeting the receptor and/or bound ligand to the lysosome for degradation (3Chen Y.G. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 58-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Several accessory proteins involved in targeting receptors for degradation have been identified. For example, Dapper 2, a late-endosomal protein, binds and facilitates lysosomal degradation of certain TGF-β type I receptors, leading to down-regulation of activin/nodal signaling in zebrafish, Xenopus, and mouse (4Zhang L. Zhou H. Su Y. Sun Z. Zhang H. Zhang L. Zhang Y. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Science. 2004; 306: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The antagonistic Smad, Smad7, can also promote lysosomal targeting of some TGF-β type I receptors by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 and inducing ubiquitination (5Ebisawa T.

Finally, the extracellular protein Bmper (BMP-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator, also known as crossveinless2) binds BMP4 and stimulates receptor-dependent internalization and lysosomal degradation of BMP4 and its receptor (7Kelley R. Ren R. Pi X. Wu Y. Moreno I. Willis M. Moser M. Ross M. Podkowa M. Attisano L. Patterson C. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).TGF-β family precursor proteins and cleavage products can also be targeted for degradation independent of receptor binding. For example, the BMP4 precursor protein is sequentially cleaved at two sites within the prodomain and this regulates ligand stability (8Cui Y. Hackenmiller R. Berg L. Jean F. Nakayama T. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage at the first site generates a non-covalently associated ligand-prodomain complex that is targeted for lysosomal degradation (9Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas subsequent cleavage at the second site, which occurs in a tissue-specific fashion (10Goldman D.C. Hackenmiller R. Nakayama T. Sopory S. Wong C. Kulessa H. Christian J.L. Development. 2006; 133: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), releases the ligand from the prodomain and thus stabilizes it. The prodomain of the zebrafish nodal-related protein, cyclops, contains a lysosomal targeting signal that destabilizes the precursor and thus restricts the signaling range of the mature ligand (11Tian J. Andrée B. Jones C.M. Sampath K. Development. 2008; 135: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). By contrast, the prodomain of mouse nodal functions in cis to stabilize the precursor (12Le Good J.A. Joubin K. Giraldez A.J. Ben-Haim N. Beck S. Chen Y. Schier A.F. Constam D.B. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 31-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas PC-mediated cleavage generates a mature ligand that is delivered to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies (13Blanchet M.H. Le Good J.A. Oorschot V. Baflast S. Minchiotti G. Klumperman J. Constam D.B. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: ra13Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The intrinsic instability of mature nodal is dependent on the prodomain because ligand generated from a chimeric precursor containing a dorsalin prodomain is substantially stabilized (14Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these soluble proteins are targeted for lysosomal degradation has not been investigated, but the observation that precursor proteins can be destabilized by elements in the prodomain prior to cleavage and receptor binding suggests the involvement of alternate trafficking receptors.Sortilin is a good candidate for an intracellular sorting receptor involved in lysosomal targeting of TGF-β family members (15Willnow T.E.

Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The luminal portion of sortilin is composed almost entirely of the Vps10p domain, a 10-bladed β-propeller fold involved in ligand binding (19Quistgaard E.M. Madsen P. Groftehauge M.K. Nissen P. Petersen C.M. Thirup S.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This is followed by a transmembrane-spanning region and a short cytoplasmic tail that is homologous to that of the cation independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, the major protein that routes soluble hydolases to the lysosome. The cytoplasmic tail of sortilin contains motifs that mediate rapid endocytosis and Golgi body to endosome trafficking (20Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized sortilin moves to the cell surface, is internalized and shuttles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomal compartments, and the plasma membrane thereafter. Only a small fraction of sortilin (∼10%) is found at the cell surface, and yet sortilin has been shown to direct trafficking of substrates not only in the biosynthetic pathway but also during endocytic retrieval from the cell surface (20Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 21Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).In addition to sorting a subset of soluble hydrolases to the lysosome, sortilin modulates trafficking of a variety of non-lysosomal proteins, either restricting or facilitating their function (16Hermey G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2677-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For example, within the biosynthetic pathway, sortilin facilitates secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins, thereby regulating plasma cholesterol levels (22Kjolby M. Andersen O.M. Breiderhoff T. Fjorback A.W. Pedersen K.M. Madsen P. Jansen P. Heeren J. Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It also controls sorting of brain-derived neurotrophic factor to the regulated secretory pathway in neurons (23Chen Z.Y. Ieraci A. Teng H. Dall H. Meng C.X. Herrera D.G. Nykjaer A. Hempstead B.L. Lee F.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6156-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and enhances anterograde transport of Trk family receptors (24Vaegter C.B. Jansen P. Fjorback A.W. Glerup S. Skeldal S. Kjolby M. Richner M. Erdmann B. Nyengaard J.R. Tessarollo L. Lewin G.R. Willnow T.E. Chao M.V. Nykjaer A. Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, sortilin negatively regulates progranulin levels by facilitating their endocytosis and degradation (25Hu F. Padukkavidana T. Vaegter C.B. Brady O.A. Zheng Y. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H.H. Nykjaer A. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 2010; 68: 654-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sortilin forms a tripartite complex with the nerve growth factor (NGF) precursor, pro-NGF, and its receptor p75NTR to induce rapid internalization and activate a signaling pathway that leads to neuronal apopotosis (26Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Kliemannel M. Schwarz E. Willnow T.E. Hempstead B.L. Petersen C.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar).In the present study, we asked whether sortilin plays a role in intracellular trafficking of TGF-β family proteins. Our results demonstrate that sortilin is a novel inhibitor of TGF-β family signaling that can bind precursor proteins in the biosynthetic pathway and promote their trafficking to the lysosome for degradation.DISCUSSIONThe current studies suggest that sortilin functions as a novel negative regulator of TGF-β family activity. Specifically, our data demonstrate that overexpressed sortilin facilitates trafficking of TGF-β precursor proteins to the lysosome for degradation. The physiological relevance of this negative regulatory mechanism is supported by our data showing that depletion of endogenous sortilin leads to enhanced BMP pathway activation, whereas enhancement of sortilin levels leads to a decrease in endogenous TGF-β signaling.Although our studies support a role for endogenous sortilin as a negative regulator of TGF-β family activity, mice mutant for Sortilin are grossly normal (37Jansen P. Giehl K. Nyengaard J.R. Teng K. Lioubinski O. Sjoegaard S.S. Breiderhoff T. Gotthardt M. Lin F. Eilers A. Petersen C.M. Lewin G.R. Hempstead B.L. Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas mice carrying mutations in critical negative regulators of TGF-β activity show a variety of defects, in some cases leading to lethality (38Walsh D.W. Godson C. Brazil D.P. Martin F. Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 244-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These phenotypic differences raise the possibility that sortilin functions primarily as a buffer to fine-tune the activity of its many substrates rather than providing an on-off switch for activity. Alternatively, other members of the VPS10 protein family may function redundantly to complement sortilin function in vivo. Consistent with either possibility, mice lacking Sortilin do not phenocopy mice mutant for other known sortilin substrates, although defects can often be uncovered on a sensitized background. For example, Sortilin nullizygous mice do not exhibit signs of lysosomal pathologies despite evidence that sortilin functions as a trafficking receptor for several soluble lysosomal proteins (39Zeng J. Racicott J. Morales C.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although sortilin is recognized as a crucial component of the proneurotrophin-p75NTR signaling complex that controls apoptotic cell death during neurogenesis (26Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Kliemannel M. Schwarz E. Willnow T.E. Hempstead B.L. Petersen C.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), Sortilin-deficient mice show reduced apoptosis in only a small subset of neurons known to undergo developmentally regulated, p75NTR-dependent apoptosis (37Jansen P. Giehl K. Nyengaard J.R. Teng K. Lioubinski O. Sjoegaard S.S. Breiderhoff T. Gotthardt M. Lin F. Eilers A. Petersen C.M. Lewin G.R. Hempstead B.L. Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). As a final example, sortilin facilitates hepatic export of lipoproteins in vivo, which is required to prevent hypercholesterolemia. This function is only apparent in Sortilin mutants, however, when plasma low-density lipoprotein levels are elevated above physiological levels by either diet or genetic background (22Kjolby M. Andersen O.M. Breiderhoff T. Fjorback A.W. Pedersen K.M. Madsen P. Jansen P. Heeren J. Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Further in-depth analysis in mice mutant for multiple members of the VPS10 protein family is needed to document whether redundancy accounts for the relatively minor defects present in Sortilin mutant mice.Mechanisms that regulate intracellular trafficking, stability, and proteolytic maturation of TGF-β family precursor proteins are poorly understood. Cleavage of pro-BMP4 is proposed to occur within the TGN and/or endosomes as the precursor traverses the biosynthetic pathway (9Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By contrast, the nodal precursor arrives at the cell surface intact via a pathway that bypasses the TGN, but then undergoes rapid endocytic uptake, prodomain removal, and delivery to lysosomes (13Blanchet M.H. Le Good J.A. Oorschot V. Baflast S. Minchiotti G. Klumperman J. Constam D.B. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: ra13Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Blanchet M.H. Le Good J.A. Mesnard D. Oorschot V. Baflast S. Minchiotti G. Klumperman J. Constam D.B. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The receptor involved in cell surface retrieval and lysosomal targeting of nodal is unknown. Interestingly, the precursor form of NGF is also secreted intact and must undergo endocytic uptake and intracellular cleavage to generate the mature ligand (40Boutilier J. Ceni C. Pagdala P.C. Forgie A. Neet K.E. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sortilin binds to the NGF precursor at the cell surface, which results in its rapid internalization and cleavage (26Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Kliemannel M. Schwarz E. Willnow T.E. Hempstead B.L. Petersen C.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 41Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M. Fainzilber M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that sortilin might function in a similar manner to direct endocytic retrieval and lysosomal targeting of nodal. Contrary to this prediction, however, we found that ectopic sortilin did not enhance uptake of nodal from the cell surface, but instead appeared to divert and/or retain nodal within the TGN as it trafficked through the biosynthetic pathway. This function is analogous to the role of the sortilin family member, SorLA, in intracellular trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (15Willnow T.E. Petersen C.M. Nykjaer A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specifically, SorLA does not affect retrograde trafficking of APP from the cell surface, but instead acts as a retention factor to prolong residence time for nascent APP molecules in the TGN, and may also shuttle APP back to the TGN from endosomes (42Spoelgen R. von Arnim C.A. Thomas A.V. Peltan I.D. Koker M. Deng A. Irizarry M.C. Andersen O.M. Willnow T.E. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 43Schmidt V. Sporbert A.

In the case of APP, this prevents release of the precursor into pathways that promote proteolytic processing into disease causing, amyloidogenic peptides (reviewed in Ref. 15Willnow T.E. Petersen C.M. Nykjaer A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Collectively, our results are consistent with a role for endogenous sortilin in enhancing trafficking of nodal and other TGF-β precursors through the TGN to the lysosome. It is possible that assays of endogenous nodal trafficking, which are not currently feasible, and/or analysis of trafficking in cells that express nodal receptors and co-receptors will show that sortilin has a role in endocytic uptake of precursors as well.Our data showing that deletion mutant forms of sortilin lacking most of the VPS10 ligand-binding domain are able to co-immunopurify with TGF-β precursor proteins are unexpected but not unprecedented. For example, following the initial demonstration that SorLA and APP interact directly via the luminal domain of each protein (44Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P. Wu X. Bales K.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Gliemann J. Mufson E.J. Hyman B.T. Paul S.M. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13461-13466Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), subsequent studies demonstrated a secondary binding site between the cytoplasmic domains of each protein (42Spoelgen R. von Arnim C.A. Thomas A.V. Peltan I.D. Koker M. Deng A. Irizarry M.C. Andersen O.M. Willnow T.E. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similarly, although it has been show that sortilin interacts directly with glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) and plays a major role in the formation of GLUT4-containing insulin responsive vesicles (45Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), more recent structure-function studies have revealed that this is not a direct binary interaction but instead requires formation of a protein complex consisting of multiple additional partners (46Shi J. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9008-9016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 47Bogan J.S. Kandror K.V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our data, which show that deletion mutant forms of sortilin lacking complimentary regions of the luminal domain are able to co-immunopurify with TGF-β family precursors, suggest a similar model in which additional binding partners function as a scaffold to mediate interactions between different domains of sortilin and TGF-β precursor proteins.In overexpression assays, deletion mutant forms of sortilin that lack the cytoplasmic tail and its attendant trafficking signals retain the ability to accelerate degradation of TGF-β precursor proteins. There are several potential explanations for this seemingly anomalous result. First although chimeric analysis shows that signals in the sortilin tail domain are sufficient to direct Golgi to endosome transport and retrieval, additional intrinsic targeting signals appear to be present within the luminal domain because truncated forms of sortilin that lack either specific sorting signals or the entire cytoplasmic domain localize to the late Golgi rather than reaching the plasma membrane (20Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 48Lefrancois S. Zeng J. Hassan A.J. Canuel M. Morales C.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6430-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our observation that SortN is enriched in the Golgi suggests that the extreme N terminus of sortilin contains information sufficient to direct Golgi localization independent of signals in the cytoplasmic tail. Using similar functional assays, previously published studies have shown that a wide range of deletion mutant forms of sortilin, or SorLA, retain function in mediating assembly of GLUT4-containing vesicles and in trafficking of APP (42Spoelgen R. von Arnim C.A. Thomas A.V. Peltan I.D. Koker M. Deng A. Irizarry M.C. Andersen O.M. Willnow T.E. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 46Shi J. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9008-9016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings have been interpreted to suggest the involvement of additional accessory proteins in directing intracellular trafficking and other functions of sortilin containing protein complexes. As one example of this, the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR has been shown to function as a trafficking switch that impairs lysosomal sorting of sortilin and its cargo, pro-NGF, and instead diverts trafficking to the cell surface (49Kim T. Hempstead B.L. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1612-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A second possible explanation for the ability of the deletion mutants to induce degradation of TGF-β precursors is that these mutants are misfolded and aggregate in the ER, leading to ER stress and protein degradation. Sortilin-dependent degradation is selective for TGF-β proteins, however, and is not dependent on proteosomal function for the subset of the proteins that we have tested, demonstrating that the ER-associated degradation pathway has not been activated. Alternatively, it is possible that sortilin mutants aggregate in post-ER compartments, leading to lysosmal targeting similar to that observed for the PC family member, furin. Signals within the cytoplasmic tail of furin direct localization predominantly to the TGN, but in the absence of these signals, determinants in the luminal domain induce aggregation in the TGN followed by lysosomal targeting (50Wolins N. Bosshart H. Küster H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is possible that similar signals function to direct aggregation and lysosomal trafficking of TGF-β family proteins bound to sortilin mutants. If so, ectopically expressed deletion mutant forms of sortilin may mediate degradation of TGF-β family members through a distinct mechanism (aggregation induced lysosomal targeting) than that used by wild type sortilin (targeting mediated by signals in the cytoplasmic tail). Further studies will be required to determine whether ER-associated degradation, ER stress-induced autophagy (51Lamark T. Johansen T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), or aggregation contribute to degradation induced by individual sortilin mutants.Taken together with previously published studies, our results are most consistent with a model in which a trafficking complex, consisting of TGF-β family precursor proteins and multiple other binding partners, assembles and escorts precursor proteins to the cell surface. We propose that sortilin is one component of this trafficking complex that can dominantly route a subset of precursor proteins to the lysosome for degradation. Our results suggest that the level of lysosomal degradation depends on the relative level of sortilin expressed by a given cell type. An alternate model is that TGF-β proteins normally associate with an endogenous trafficking complex that escorts precursors to the cell surface via a TGN-independent route. Sortilin may compete with components of this complex for binding to TGF-β precursors, thereby diverting trafficking through the TGN to the lysosome. This scenario is consistent with our observation that ectopic sortilin can divert trafficking of TGF-β precursor proteins even when expressed at substoichiometric ratios. Future studies will be required to definitively test these models and identify additional components of TGF-β trafficking complexes.

MDSCs infiltrate into tumors and promote tumor invasion and metastasis. To identify the mediator responsible for the prometastatic property of MDSCs, we used proteomics. We found neutrophilic granule protein (NGP) was decreased > 2-fold in MDSCs from metastatic 4T1 tumor-bearing mice compared to nonmetastatic 67NR controls. NGP mRNA levels were decreased in bone marrow and in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs by 45 and 66%, respectively, in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice compared to 67NR controls. Interestingly, 4T1-conditioned medium reduced myeloid cell NGP expression by ~40%, suggesting that a secreted factor mediates gene reduction. Sequence analysis shows a putative cystatin domain in NGP, and biochemical analysis confirms NGP a novel cathepsin inhibitor. It inhibited cathepsin B activity by nearly 40% in vitro. NGP expression in 4T1 tumor cells suppressed cell invasion, delayed primary tumor growth, and greatly reduced lung metastasis in vivo. A 2.8-fold reduction of cathepsin activity was found in tumors expressing NGP compared to controls. NGP significantly reduced tumor angiogenesis to 12.6 from 19.6 and lymphangiogenesis to 4.6 from 9.1 vessels/field. Necrosis was detectable only in NGP-expressing tumors, and the number of apoptotic cells increased to 22.4 from 8.3 in controls. Taken together, this study identifies a negative regulator of tumor metastasis in MDSCs, NGP, which is down-regulated in metastatic conditions. The finding suggests that malignant tumors promote invasion/metastasis not only through up-regulation of proteases but also down-regulation of protease inhibitors.—Boutté, A. M., Friedman, D.

IntroductionG protein coupled receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins are the predominant components through which cells receive and transduce extracellular signals. G protein signal transduction is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, haploid a-type cells secrete an a-factor pheromone that binds to receptors on the surface of α-type cells, whereas α-type cells secrete an α-factor that acts exclusively on a-type cells (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Consequently, the haploid cells fuse to form an a/α diploid cell.As with other G protein systems, activation of the yeast pheromone receptor stimulates exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein α subunit (Gpa1), 2The abbreviations used are: Gpa1G protein α subunitSCFSkp1/Cullin/F-boxPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidUDubiquitination domain. which promotes its dissociation from the Gβγ (Ste4/18) heterodimer (1Dohlman H.G.

In yeast, Gβγ is primarily responsible for transmission and amplification of the signal to effector proteins, whereas the Gα subunit serves primarily to regulate the levels of free Gβγ. As a consequence, cells are highly sensitive to small changes in the stoichiometry of Gα and Gβγ (3Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Cappell S.D. Baker R. Skowyra D. Dohlman H.G. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25435-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The signal is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on the Gα subunit, which promotes reassociation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. Further regulation is imposed by accelerating the GTPase activity of Gα via regulators of G protein signaling proteins (6Hepler J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Propagation of the G protein signal requires components of a MAPK cascade (Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, Fus3, or Kss1), a MAPK scaffold (Ste5), as well as a transcription factor (Ste12) (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Consequently, the pheromone initiates changes in gene expression and cell morphology that prepare the cell to undergo cell-cell and nuclear fusion. Critical to this process is the initiation of cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, which ensures that each haploid cell contains exactly one copy of every chromosome before fusion (7Wittenberg C. La Valle R. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pheromone-induced G1 arrest necessarily prevents fusion during DNA replication (S phase) or before mitosis (M phase), during which nuclear fusion could lead to missegregation of genetic material, aneuploidy, and other proliferative disadvantages (8Torres E.M.

Genetics. 2008; 179: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Consequently, yeast mating and cell cycle progression must be highly coordinated processes.The mating pathway is well known to regulate the cell cycle by stimulating expression of Far1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that arrests cells at START in late G1 phase (10McKinney J.D.

Degradation of Far1 is initiated in G1 by cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation, which promotes its ubiquitination by the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box) ubiquitin ligase (13Oehlen L.J. Cross F.R.

Sci. 1999; 354: 1533-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), as yet the kinase that phosphorylates Gpa1 has not been identified.Here we identify a novel G protein kinase, Elm1. We show that the G protein is phosphorylated directly by Elm1 and that phosphorylation occurs in coordination with Elm1 expression during the cell cycle. G protein phosphorylation in G2/M phase leads to ubiquitination during the following G1 phase. In the absence of Elm1, the G protein is neither phosphorylated nor ubiquitinated. Taken together, these findings show how G proteins can simultaneously regulate, and become regulated by, progression through the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONIt is now well established that the G protein α subunit Gpa1 is ubiquitinated. Here we have begun to discern how this ubiquitination event is regulated. Our investigation began by showing that Gpa1 is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation results in an electrophoretic mobility shift of the protein. This property allowed us to determine that a single kinase (Elm1) is necessary for proper phosphorylation in vivo. Using purified components, we showed that Elm1 is also sufficient for Gpa1 phosphorylation in vitro. Elm1 is expressed primarily in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Correspondingly, we found that the G protein is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Gpa1 is polyubiquitinated by SCF, and phosphorylation is typically required for SCF-mediated ubiquitination. Thus, we investigated whether phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination of Gpa1 and whether ubiquitination also occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Indeed, although Gpa1 phosphorylation peaks in G2/M phase, ubiquitination occurs in the subsequent G1 phase. These findings establish that G proteins can be regulated by progression through the cell cycle. More broadly, they raise the possibility that other pathway components may also be subject to cell cycle regulation.The participation of Elm1 in G protein signaling was unexpected. Elm1 is best known as a protein kinase that coordinates events leading to cell division, including bud emergence, mitosis, and cytokinesis (33Asano S. Park J.E. Yu L.R. Zhou M. Sakchaisri K.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another kinase that phosphorylates and deactivates the morphogenesis checkpoint protein Swe1 (Hsl1) (40Szkotnicki L. Crutchley J.M.

Cell. 2009; 20: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and a fourth kinase that inhibits the mitotic exit network when the spindle position checkpoint is activated (Kin4) (56Caydasi A.K. Kurtulmus B. Orrico M.I. Hofmann A. Ibrahim B. Pereira G. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that Gpa1 is regulated by any of these Elm1 substrates, given that deletion of those genes has no effect on Gpa1 phosphorylation or pheromone responsiveness. Thus, Gpa1 represents a new target of Elm1.Whereas elm1Δ was the only mutant that exhibited a loss of Gpa1 phosphorylation, some residual phosphorylation could still be detected in vivo (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we speculate that Gpa1 is phosphorylated by another kinase. Possibilities include kinases that are absent from the gene deletion array, kinases essential for cell viability, and kinases that have functions related to Elm1. Elm1 is one of three closely related kinases, including Tos3 and Sak1. All three proteins are known to phosphorylate and activate Snf1 (the yeast homolog of human AMPK (5′ AMP-activated protein kinase), primarily under conditions of glucose starvation (57Hedbacker K. Carlson M. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2408-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Under the normal growth conditions used to assess mating pheromone responses however, deletion of TOS3, SAK1, or SNF1 does not appear to affect Gpa1 phosphorylation or pheromone signaling (supplemental Fig. 1A). Taken together, our findings indicate that Elm1 is largely responsible for Gpa1 phosphorylation, is uniquely able to regulate the pheromone response pathway, and does so in a cell cycle-dependent manner.Other lines of evidence support the model that Elm1 phosphorylates Gpa1. First, Gpa1 is neither phosphorylated nor ubiquitinated when Elm1 is absent. In contrast, we did not observe any such differences in the absence of 108 other kinases. Second, we did not observe any differences in the absence of 31 different protein phosphatases. Thus it is unlikely that Elm1 acts indirectly by inhibiting the function of a Gpa1-phosphatase. Third, we detected a substantial accumulation of phosphorylated Gpa1 in the absence of the SCF function. Finally, we detected a substantial enrichment of Gpa1 polyubiquitination in G1-arrested cells as compared with S or G2/M-arrested cell cultures. These data confirm that phosphorylation and ubiquitination occur in a cell cycle-dependent manner and that phosphorylation precedes ubiquitination.As the primary negative regulator of the mating pathway, Gpa1 is a logical target for regulation by posttranslational modifications. We have shown that pheromone-dependent gene transcription is diminished in cells that lack Elm1 function. Similarly, pheromone-dependent gene transcription is diminished in cells expressing Gpa1ΔUD. Gpa1ΔUD lacks a domain (UD, residues 129–236) that is required for ubiquitination by SCF as well as phosphorylation by Elm1 (4Cappell S.D. Baker R. Skowyra D. Dohlman H.G. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 746-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y. Marotti Jr., L.A. Lee M.J. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 284-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Gpa1 ubiquitination domain cannot be the only target of phosphorylation, however, because mutation of all 15 serine and threonine residues within this region failed to diminish phosphorylation in vitro (data not shown) or ubiquitination in vivo (supplemental Fig. 4). Thus, alternate phosphorylation sites are likely to exist, and these may likewise target the protein for polyubiquitination, at least under some circumstances. Taken together, these data indicate that phosphorylation can occur at multiple sites throughout the protein, whereas ubiquitination is restricted to a specific subdomain of the protein.We have now identified the primary components necessary for Gpa1 phosphorylation (Elm1) and polyubiquitination (SCF). While much has been learned, substantive questions remain. For instance, we have yet to establish how Elm1 and SCF work together to modulate G protein function. All existing data indicate redundancy within this process because perturbations to phosphorylation or ubiquitination have modest effects on G protein stability. Selective pressure in yeast may have instilled this property because cells lacking Gpa1 cannot grow as a result of G1 cell cycle arrest. Alternatively phosphorylation and ubiquitination may affect G protein signaling in other ways. For example, ubiquitination could affect G protein catalytic activity. Ubiquitination could also serve to restrict Gpa1 localization to specific signal transduction complexes. Considering that Elm1 is localized predominately to the bud neck between dividing cells, Gpa1 phosphorylation and subsequent polyubiquitination may occur only during cell division or within a specialized subdomain of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). Indeed, Gpa1 was recently shown to concentrate to the bud neck during G2/M phase, where Elm1 is located (58Suchkov D.V. DeFlorio R. Draper E. Ismael A. Sukumar M. Arkowitz R. Stone D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1737-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The yeast mating response is perhaps the best-characterized of any signal transduction system, yet it continues to reveal new mechanisms of signal regulation. It has long been known that pheromone stimulation activates the G protein and promotes cell cycle arrest in G1. We now find that the G protein α subunit is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in a manner that is contingent on cell cycle progression. The abundance of phosphorylated Gpa1 increases as cells progress through the S and G2/M phases and decreases rapidly after cells divide and enter G1 phase. Taken together, these data show that the G protein can be dynamically regulated. More broadly, these findings reveal a previously unsuspected degree of coordination between G protein signaling and cell division. IntroductionG protein coupled receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins are the predominant components through which cells receive and transduce extracellular signals. G protein signal transduction is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, haploid a-type cells secrete an a-factor pheromone that binds to receptors on the surface of α-type cells, whereas α-type cells secrete an α-factor that acts exclusively on a-type cells (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Consequently, the haploid cells fuse to form an a/α diploid cell.As with other G protein systems, activation of the yeast pheromone receptor stimulates exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein α subunit (Gpa1), 2The abbreviations used are: Gpa1G protein α subunitSCFSkp1/Cullin/F-boxPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidUDubiquitination domain. which promotes its dissociation from the Gβγ (Ste4/18) heterodimer (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In yeast, Gβγ is primarily responsible for transmission and amplification of the signal to effector proteins, whereas the Gα subunit serves primarily to regulate the levels of free Gβγ. As a consequence, cells are highly sensitive to small changes in the stoichiometry of Gα and Gβγ (3Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Cappell S.D. Baker R. Skowyra D. Dohlman H.G. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25435-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The signal is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on the Gα subunit, which promotes reassociation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. Further regulation is imposed by accelerating the GTPase activity of Gα via regulators of G protein signaling proteins (6Hepler J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Propagation of the G protein signal requires components of a MAPK cascade (Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, Fus3, or Kss1), a MAPK scaffold (Ste5), as well as a transcription factor (Ste12) (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Consequently, the pheromone initiates changes in gene expression and cell morphology that prepare the cell to undergo cell-cell and nuclear fusion. Critical to this process is the initiation of cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, which ensures that each haploid cell contains exactly one copy of every chromosome before fusion (7Wittenberg C. La Valle R. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1992312576,"The nature of inflammatory signals determines the outcome of T cell responses. However, little is known about how inflammatory cytokines provided to human CD8 T cells during activation affects their susceptibility to post-activation cell death. We have examined and compared the effects of the inflammatory cytokine IL-12, as well as the combination of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23 (IL-1/6/23) on the susceptibility of primary human CD8 T cells to post-activation cell death. Human CD8 T cells activated in the presence of IL-1/6/23 underwent significantly less cell death after activation as compared with those activated in IL-12. This was due to reduced susceptibility to Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD). Mechanistically, the reduced level of cell death in CD8 T cells activated in IL-1/6/23 was a result of a low level of FasL expression and high level of c-FLIP(S) expression. When the effect of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23 individually was examined, IL-1 or IL-6 alone was sufficient to inhibit CD8 T cell death that occurs after activation in IL-12. IL-1, but not IL-6, inhibited expression of FasL, whereas IL-6, but not IL-1, increased c-FLIP(S) expression. Our findings show that the presence of IL-1 and/or IL-6 during activation of human CD8 T cells attenuates Fas-mediated AICD, whereas IL-12 increases the susceptibility of activated CD8 T cells to this form of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1972727377,"Sumoylation regulates a wide range of cellular processes. However, little is known about the regulation of the SUMO machinery. In this study, we demonstrate that two lysine residues (Lys-153 and Lys-157) in the C-terminal region of the yeast E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 are the major and minor autosumoylation sites, respectively. Surprisingly, mutation of Lys-157 (ubc9(K157R)) significantly stimulates the level of Ubc9 autosumoylation at Lys-153. The functional role of Ubc9 autosumoylation is exemplified in our findings that cell cycle-dependent sumoylation of cytoskeletal septin proteins is inversely correlated with the Ubc9 autosumoylation level and that mutation of the Ubc9 autosumoylation sites results in aberrant cell morphology. Our study elucidates a regulatory mechanism that utilizes automodification of the E2 enzyme of the sumoylation machinery to control substrate sumoylation."

The interplay between LAP*, LAP, and LIP in regulating cellular processes is largely unknown, and LIP has been largely regarded to repress transcription through a passive heterodimerization-dependent mechanism. Recently, we have shown that p300/GCN5 and mSin3A/HDAC1 differentially regulate the ability of C/EBPβ to stimulate preadipocyte differentiation through activation of C/ebpα transcription. Here, we have mapped requirements for binding of mSin3A/HDAC1 to LAP/LAP* and LIP to a 4-amino acid motif in the central region of LAP/LAP* (residues 153–156) and the N terminus of LIP. Reducing mSin3A/HDAC1 binding to LAP/LAP* and LIP through deletion of this motif reduced the recruitment of HDAC1 to the C/ebpα promoter and increased preadipocyte differentiation stimulated by insulin and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Additional studies showed that the interaction of HDAC1 with LIP provides for active repression of C/ebpα transcription and is largely responsible for the ability of LIP and HDAC1 to repress preadipocyte differentiation. Thus, although mSin3A/HDAC1 interacted readily with LAP/LAP* in addition to LIP and that expression of LAP/LAP* was sufficient to recruit HDAC1 to the C/ebpα promoter, mutations in C/ebpβ that abrogated HDAC1 association to LAP/LAP* in the absence of LIP provided no additional stimulation of differentiation or transcription beyond the deletion of LIP alone.

https://openalex.org/W2153621609,"We describe a novel transgenic system for tissue-specific and inducible control of gene expression in mice. The system employs a tetracycline-responsive CMV promoter that controls transcription of a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) that remains nonfunctional until an interrupting reporter cassette is excised by Cre recombinase. Insertion of Dicer and Drosha RNase processing sites within the shRNA allows generation of siRNA to knock down a target gene efficiently. Tissue-specific shRNA expression is achieved through the use of appropriate inducer mice with tissue-specific expression of Cre. We applied this system to regulate expression of junctophilins (JPs), genes essential for maintenance of membrane ultrastructure and Ca(2+) signaling in muscle. Transgenic mice with skeletal muscle-specific expression of shRNA against JP mRNAs displayed no basal change of JP expression before treatment with doxycycline (Dox), while inducible and reversible knockdown of JPs was achieved by feeding mice with Dox-containing water. Dox-induced knockdown of JPs led to abnormal junctional membrane structure and Ca(2+) signaling in adult muscle fibers, consistent with essential roles of JPs in muscle development and function. This transgenic approach can be applied for inducible and reversible gene knockdown or gene overexpression in many different tissues, thus providing a versatile system for elucidating the physiological gene function in viable animal models."

GdDOTA-CTB was injected into the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) or the olfactory pathway of rats. High-resolution MR images were collected at a range of time points at 11.7T and 7T. The transported GdDOTA-CTB was visible for at least 1 month post-injection, clearing within 2 months. Control injections of non-conjugated GdDOTA into S1 were not transported and cleared within 1-2 days. Control injections of Gd-Albumin were not transported either, clearing within 7 days. These MR results were verified by classic immunohistochemical staining for CTB, in the same animals. The GdDOTA-CTB neuronal transport was target specific, monosynaptic, stable for several weeks, and reproducible."

There is at least a 25% sequence identity among all TIMPs, including 12 conserved Cys residues that form 6 disulfide bridges resulting in 6 loop regions. There are two domains, N-terminal and C-terminal, in TIMPs. An N-terminal domain (NT-TIMP) binds the CAT, carries the MMP-inhibitory activity, and encompasses the three first loops. A non-inhibitory C-terminal domain (CT-TIMP) binds, albeit with distinct affinities, the PEX of MMPs. TIMP-1 forms a stoichiometric complex with the MMP-9 proenzyme via the binding of its CT-TIMP with the PEX (9Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In turn, TIMP-2 forms a complex with the MMP-2 proenzyme (10Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S. He C.S.

The inhibitory NT-TIMP alone and the individual CAT of MMPs were predominantly used in these studies. Differences in contacts and chemistry of the interfaces of TIMP·MMP complexes provide a basis for re-engineering of the inhibitory selectivity. Because of its exceedingly poor association constant, TIMP-1 is incapable of efficiently inhibiting the full-length MT1-MMP enzyme, albeit a certain level of inhibition was observed with the individual catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (21Will H.

A single point mutation of Thr98 to Leu (T98L) at a distal site from the inhibitory loop, however, increased the association constant and transformed the NT-TIMP of TIMP-1 into a tight-binding inhibitor of MT1-MMP (14Grossman M. Tworowski D. Dym O. Lee M.H. Levy Y. Murphy G. Sagi I. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 6184-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Lee M.H. Atkinson S. Rapti M. Handsley M. Curry V. Edwards D. Murphy G. Cancer Lett. 2010; 290: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There are, however, additional important structural elements, which are outside of the inhibitory and catalytic domains of the inhibitor and the proteinase, respectively. Thus, the contacts of the CT-TIMP of TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 are required with the C-terminal, non-catalytic domain to achieve an efficient inhibition of a disintegrin and metalloprotease-10 (ADAM10). The NT-TIMP alone is insufficient for the inhibition of ADAM10 (28Rapti M. Atkinson S.J. Lee M.H. Trim A. Moss M. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Conversely, the full-length TIMP-4 is a week inhibitor of ADAM17 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme; TACE), whereas the C-terminal truncation significantly increases the inhibitor's potency (29Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15967-15975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Overall, both the CT-TIMP and its counterpart, the C-terminal non-catalytic PEX in MMPs, play a likely important, albeit unidentified, role in the mechanisms of inhibition of MMPs by TIMPs. To highlight the effect of the PEX on the interactions of MT1-MMP with the full-length TIMPs, we designed and characterized the MT1-MMP mutants with the truncated domains and also the MT1-MMP chimeras. In these chimeras the original PEX was substituted in the MT1-MMP molecule by the PEX derived from MMP-2 and MMP-9. We specifically selected MMP-2 and MMP-9 because of their contrasting proenzyme complex formations with TIMP-2 and TIMP-1, respectively. In addition, we specifically selected TIMP-1 for our experiments because of its exceedingly low ability to interact with MT1-MMP and because any improvement of the affinity of TIMP-1 would be readily recorded. Based on our experiments, we now suggest that the interactions between the PEX of the full-length MT1-MMP and the CT-TIMP also contribute to the inhibitory efficacy of TIMPs. As it appears now, the global fold of the PEX, the interdomain dynamics, and the intrinsic protein flexibility of both MMPs and TIMPs play a role in defining the binding interface in the course of inhibition of the full-length cellular MMPs by the full-length TIMPs. From the practical perspectives, it is likely that constraining the specificity of TIMPs toward the individual full-length MMPs also requires the modification in the non-inhibitory CT-TIMP and that the modifications in the inhibitory NT-TIMP alone are insufficient for the re-design of the inhibitor specificity.

The C-end-truncated MT1-MMP (ΔCYTO) mutant lacking the 563–582 CYTO sequence was described earlier (38Rozanov D.V. Ghebrehiwet B. Ratnikov B. Monosov E.Z. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y.

The inert mutant lacking the 112–284 sequence of the CAT (ΔCAT) and the mutant lacking the 319–508 sequence of the PEX (ΔPEX) were described earlier (39Remacle A.G. Rozanov D.V. Baciu P.C.

Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate double transfectants, the parental MCF-7 cells were first transfected with the full-length β3 integrin chain cDNA in the pcDNA3.1-neo plasmid (MCF7-β3 cells) as described earlier (40Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Jungwirth K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). MCF7-β3 cells were next transfected with the original pcDNA3.1-zeo vector or the pcDNA3.1-zeo plasmid encoding for the WT, E240A, ΔCAT, ΔPEX, ΔCYTO, PEX/MMP-2, and PEX/MMP-9 constructs to generate the respective stably transfected cell lines. Routinely, transfected cell lines were maintained in DMEM-10% FBS supplemented with G418 and/or Zeocin (0.2 mg/ml each). In addition, to quantitatively assess the inhibitory potency of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 against the WT and PEX/MMP-9 constructs, we employed MCF7-β3 cells transiently transfected with the pcDNA3.1-zeo plasmid encoding for WT and PEX/MMP-9. The cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX and the Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were used in our inhibitory experiment in 48 h post-transfection. Cells were grown in wells of a 6-well plate in the presence of GM6001 (50 μm). Cell were then surface-biotinylated using non-cleavable membrane-impermeable EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.3 mg/ml in Sorensen phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 14.7 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm Na2HPO4, and 120 mm sorbitol) (41Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cells were next lysed using 50 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture set III (N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside buffer). The biotin-labeled plasma membrane proteins were pooled down using streptavidin beads (42Remacle A.G. Chekanov A.V. Golubkov V.S. Savinov A.Y. Rozanov D.V. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

The precipitates were dissolved in SDS sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.005% Bromphenol Blue) with 100 mm DTT and analyzed by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP antibody followed by the secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and a SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit. For the uptake experiments, cells were surface-biotinylated using the cleavable membrane-impermeable EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Immediately following the biotinylation procedure, cells were incubated for 25 min at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium to allow the internalization of biotin-labeled MT1-MMP (41Remacle A.

To remove the residual cell surface biotin, cells were incubated for 25 min on ice in Sorensen phosphate buffer containing membrane-impermeable MESNA (150 mm). Cells were next extensively washed using Sorensen phosphate buffer and lysed, and the lysates were precipitated using streptavidin beads and analyzed as above. Cells (2 × 105) were grown in DMEM-10% FBS for 18 h. Where indicated, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing TIMP-1 (100 nm), TIMP-2 (100 nm), A-TIMP-2 (100 nm), or GM6001 (50 μm). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in the N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside buffer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g; 15 min). The supernatant aliquots (3 μg of total protein) were analyzed under reducing conditions by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP antibodies as above. Cells (2 × 105) were seeded for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS in wells of a 24-well plate. The medium was then replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM (0.225 ml/well) supplemented with pro-MMP-2 (0.5 nm). Where indicated, TIMP-1 (1–1,000 nm), TIMP-2 (1–1,000 nm), A-TIMP-2 (100 nm), or GM6001 (50 μm) was added to the samples. In 24 h the medium aliquots (20 μl) were analyzed by gelatin zymography in 0.1% gelatin-10% acrylamide gels. Alternatively, to concentrate the samples 3- to 4-fold and, as a result, to increase the sensitivity of the procedure (e.g. with the MT1-MMP chimeras), the 150-μl medium aliquots were precipitated at 4 °C for 16 h using gelatin-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl of a 50% slurry), eluted using 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, and a half of the eluted material was analyzed by gelatin zymography. MMP activity was measured in triplicate in wells of a 96-well plate in 0.2 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 50 μm ZnCl2. Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2 (10 μm) was used as a fluorescent substrate. The concentration of MT1-MMP and MT6-MMP in the reactions was 5 nm. The steady-state rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored continuously (λex = 320 nm and λem = 400 nm) at 37 °C for 3–25 min using a fluorescent spectrophotometer. Where indicated, TIMP-1 (25–125 nm) and TIMP-2 (25–125 nm) were co-incubated for 30 min at 20 °C with the MMP samples prior to adding the substrate. Cells grown on 15-mm glass coverslips were fixed for 20 min with 4% formaldehyde. Where indicated, cells were permeabilized for 4 min using 0.1% Triton X-100 or left untreated. Cells were then blocked for 1 h at ambient temperature using 10% BSA in PBS and then stained overnight at 4 °C with the MT1-MMP 3G4 antibody (dilution 1:1000) or the polyclonal rabbit MT1-MMP AB815 antibody (dilution 1:200) followed by a 1-h incubation with the secondary species-specific antibody (dilution 1:200) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594. The slides were mounted in the Vectashield medium containing DAPI for the nuclear staining. The slides were analyzed using an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope equipped with a MagnaFire digital camera. FITC-gelatin was prepared as described earlier (33Radichev I.A. Remacle A.G.

The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 16 min, permeabilized for 4 min using 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained for MT1-MMP as described above.

The structures were analyzed and superimposed using PyMOL. The images were prepared also in PyMOL. Like all of the other members of the MMP family, the active MT1-MMP proteinase is regulated by TIMPs. The association constant of TIMP-1 with the MT1-MMP enzyme, however, is exceedingly poor. This association constant is significantly less efficient compared with those of TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 (23Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2113695349,"Spindle cell sarcomas consist of tumors with different biological features, of which distant metastasis is the most ominous sign for a poor prognosis. However, metastasis is difficult to predict on the basis of current histopathological analyses. We have identified actin filament-associated protein 1-like 1 (AFAP1L1) as a candidate for a metastasis-predicting marker from the gene expression profiles of 65 spindle cell sarcomas. A multivariate analysis determined that AFAP1L1 was an independent factor for predicting the occurrence of distant metastasis (P=0.0001), which was further confirmed in another set of 41 tumors by a quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Immunohistochemical staining using paraffin-embedded tumor tissues revealed that the metastasis-free rate was significantly better in tumors negative for AFAP1L1 (P=0.0093 by log-rank test). Knocking down the AFAP1L1 gene in sarcoma cells resulted in inhibition of the cell invasion, and forced expression of AFAP1L1 in immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells induced anchorage-independent growth and increased cell invasiveness with high activity levels of matrix metallopeptidase. Furthermore, tumor growth in vivo was accelerated in AFAP1L1-transduced sarcoma cell lines. These results suggest that AFAP1L1 has a role in the progression of spindle cell sarcomas and is a prognostic biomarker."

We show here that the bulged adenosine in domain VI of RmInt1 is required for splicing via the branching pathway, but branch site mutants produce small numbers of RNA molecules in which the first G residue of the intron is linked to the last C residue. Mutations in the coordination loop in domain I reduced splicing efficiency, but branched templates clearly predominated among splicing products. We also found that a single substitution at the EBS3 position (G329C), preventing EBS3-IBS3 pairing, resulted in the production of 50 to 100 times more RNA molecules in which the 5′ and 3′ extremities were joined. We provide evidence that these intron molecules may correspond to both, intron circles linked by a 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond, and tandem, head-to-tail intron copies.

Group II introns are large catalytic RNAs with a conserved secondary structure consisting of six domains arranged around a central wheel (1Pyle A.M. Ribozymes and RNA Catalysis. RCS Publishing, Cambridge, UK2008: 201-228Google Scholar). Group II introns may self-splice via several different pathways (Fig. 1). The main splicing pathway in group II introns involves two sequential trans-esterification reactions. In the first, the 2′-hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine near the end of the intron, in domain VI, triggers a nucleophilic attack on the 5′ splice site. In the second reaction, the 2′–5′ branched product is released as a lariat when the free 3′-OH at the end of the 5′ exon attacks the 3′ splice junction joining the two exons (2van der Veen R.

Recent studies have reported the presence, within domain I of group IIB introns, of a branch site receptor known as a coordination loop (9de Lencastre A. Hamill S. Pyle A.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 626-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is required for trans-esterification (8Hamill S. Pyle A.M. Mol.

Sci. 2009; 34: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This coordination loop has been identified as a key element for exon ligation, as it positions the exon and intron binding sequences, the EBS3-IBS3 base pair and the EBS1-IBS1 helix, in an appropriate conformation for reaction (9de Lencastre A. Hamill S. Pyle A.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 626-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is also an alternative splicing pathway, the first step of which involves hydrolysis. The ligated exons and linear intron are then generated in a standard second step (11van der Veen R. Kwakman J.H. Grivell L.A.

An additional excision reaction, in which the intron is excised as a putative circle, has also been proposed for some group II introns (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F.

In this case, prior release of the 3′ exon from the precursor molecules, presumably via a trans-splicing mechanism, seems to be required for the generation of a putative 2′-5′ ligated circular intron. The origin and function of such intron circles in vivo remains unknown. RmInt1 is a mobile subclass IIB3 intron (17Toro N. Environ.

Sinorhizobium meliloti RMO17 was used to characterize the in vivo activities of RmInt1 because this rhizobial strain has no copy of RmInt1 in its genome (20Nisa-Martínez R. Jiménez-Zurdo J.I. Martínez-Abarca F. Muñoz-Adelantado E. Toro N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for the construction of mutants and cloning. S. meliloti was cultured in TY medium at 28 °C, whereas E. coli strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. For plasmid maintenance, we added the following antibiotics as required: 200 μg/ml kanamycin for rhizobia and 50 μg/ml kanamycin for E. coli; 200 μg/ml ampicilin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline, for both types of bacteria. pKGEMA4T7 is a construct similar to pKGEMA4 (20Nisa-Martínez R.

The dVI-ΔA764, dVI-A764C, dVI-pU, EBS3C, EBS3U, EBS3A, and CL2 point mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the Altered Sites II in Vitro Mutagenesis pAlter-1 System (Promega), with the changes introduced into pALΔORFT7. We generated pALΔORFT7 by inserting the SacI fragment containing ΔORFT7 from pKGEMA4T7 into pAlter-1. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are listed in supplemental Table 1. The final constructs were generated by replacing the ΔORF in pKGEMA4 with a ΔORFT7-containing fragment generated by SacI digestion of the mutated pALΔORFT7 plasmids. pKG4CL1T7 was constructed by two-step PCR (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with the Triple MasterTM PCR system (Eppendorf). Two pairs of primers were designed for amplification of the 5′ and 3′ sections of the ribozyme: the SacBbr and CL/DN primers were used to generate the 270-bp upstream fragment; the 435-bp downstream fragment was generated by amplification with the CL/UP and pT7R primers. The mutagenic primers contained an overlapping region of 27 bp and introduced the AGCCC sequence in place of GAGGA at ribozyme positions 222–226. The second PCR step was performed with SacBbr and pT7R primers and generated a 678-bp fragment. The PmlI/XhoI-digested PCR product was inserted in place of the wild-type fragment in pKGEMA4T7. The double mutant was obtained with the same protocol as for pKG4CL2T7, but with pALΔORF-CL1T7 used as the template for mutagenesis. All six γ-γ′ mutants were obtained by PCR with the AccuprimeTM PCR System (Invitrogen). γ′G was generated by one round of PCR with the 5Q_CAT and γ′G primers. The γC mutant was generated by a two-step PCR in which the 5Q_CAT and γC-rv primers were used to amplify the 5′ region of the ribozyme and the 3′ region was obtained by amplification with the γC-fw and 6QR_LACZ primers. In the second round of PCR, a mixture of these two PCR products was subjected to amplification with the 5Q_CAT and 6QR_LACZ primers. The exchanged γC-γ′G mutant was generated by two-step PCR with the 5Q_CAT and γC-rv primers (5′ region) and the γC-fw and γ′G primers (3′ region). The next round of PCR was performed with the 5Q_CAT and γ′G primers. The EBS3C+γC-γ′G combined mutant was obtained by using an EBS3C mutant ribozyme as the PCR template. All of the mutated ribozymes were then inserted, as PmlI-BlnI fragments, into pICGter-E1E2, which consists of short flanking exons (−20/+5, exon 1 and exon 2, respectively) fused in-frame with the N terminus of the lacZ gene under the control of a constitutive promoter and capped with a custom-designed Rho-independent transcription terminator (21Chillón I. Martínez-Abarca F. Toro N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutants derived from pICG required IEP trans-complementation, so we produced this protein constitutively from pKGIEP (22Muñoz-Adelantado E. San Filippo J. Martínez-Abarca F. García-Rodríguez F.M. Lambowitz A.M. Toro N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from cultures of free-living S. meliloti strain RMO17 containing plasmids carrying the wild-type or mutant RmInt1, as described previously (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The bacterial cells present in 10 ml of a culture with an A600 of 0.6 units were lysed in the presence of proteinase K (in 1.4% SDS, 4 mm EDTA, 125 μg proteinase K) for 10 min at 65 °C. DNA was eliminated by incubation with 50 units of RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) and subsequent phenol (pH 4.5)/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction. Finally, the RNA was precipitated and resuspended in 25 μl of nuclease-free water. We minimized the amount of DNA present in the RNA samples by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNeasy technology makes it possible to purify high quality RNA rapidly, due to the combination of the stringency of guanidine-isothiocyanate lysis and the efficiency of silica-membrane purification. RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biological samples were lysed and homogenized. Ethanol was added, and the lysate was loaded onto the RNeasy silica membrane, which efficiently binds RNA, making it possible to wash off all the other contaminants. High quality RNA was eluted in 30 μl of water. This technology efficiently removes most of the DNA without the need for DNase treatment, but certain applications are sensitive to very small amounts of DNA. We therefore removed any residual trace amounts of DNA by RNase-free DNase I digestion (Qiagen) followed by subsequent silica-membrane purification and elution in 30 μl of nuclease-free water. The absence of DNA was verified by PCR. Primer extension reactions were performed as described previously (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We annealed 15 μg of total RNA with 0.2 pmol (300,000 cpm) of (5′-32P)-labeled P primer in 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.5), 400 mm NaCl. This mixture was heated at 85 °C for 5 min, rapidly cooled to 60 °C, and then allowed to cool slowly to 45 °C, over a period of 10 min. Extension reactions were carried out by reverse transcription with AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) at 42 °C for 60 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis in a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel and quantified with the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad). The excision efficiency was normalized to the WT levels and calculated according to the intensity of the 97-nt product to compare the results between the different plasmid construct used along the experiment. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA synthesis was initiated by annealing 6.5 μg of total cellular RNA and 25 pmol of a specific primer in the presence of 12.5 mmol dNTPs. We used Ect1 or ICI oligonucleotides for cDNA synthesis. We then added 5× first strand buffer, 0.2 mol DTT, 30 units of RNAguardTM RNase inhibitor (GE Healthcare), and 400 units of SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 120 min. We used one-fifteenth of the products of this reaction as a template for PCR with 15 pmol of LL primer, which was designed to be complementary to a sequence 59 nt from the 3′ end of RmInt1, 15 pmol of 5′-radiolabeled P primer (∼150,000 cpm), 6.25 mmol dNTP mix, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a final volume of 25 μl. The RT-PCR products (1 μl) were resolved by electrophoresis in a denaturing 6% polycrylamide gel. The bands subsequently were analyzed by sequencing at least eight different clones. Before sequencing, cloned PCR products derived from templates in which the intron extremities were linked together were selected by PCR with the Iq3′ and P primers. We generated the first-strand cDNA from 10 μg of S. meliloti RMO17 total RNA carrying various plasmids, with 12.5 pmol of ICI oligonucleotide used as the primer and 300 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase RNase H− (Invitrogen), in a final volume of 10 μl (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We carried out qPCR in the iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad). We used a 1:10 dilution of the cDNA product, with the addition of 0.2 mm of each specific oligonucleotide primer, SYBR Green I (dilution of 1:10,000) and 0.5 units of Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following real-time PCR cycling conditions were used for all quantifications: 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 68 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C and a final extension phase for 3 min at 72 °C. The templates in which the 5′ and 3′ extremities of the intron were joined together were amplified with the Ect1 and Iq3′ primers. Iq3′ contains the last six nucleotides of the RmInt1 ribozyme, resulting in the amplification principally of the above molecules, with branched (lariat) molecules amplified much less efficiently (additional information in supplemental Fig. 1). Standard dilutions of known quantities of plasmid DNA were included in each run for the generation of quantification curves and the evaluation of amplification efficiency. RNA samples that had not been treated with reverse transcriptase were included to check for DNA contamination. Negative controls in which the template was omitted were also included. In some experiments, amplification was also carried out with the 5Q_CAT and P primers, demonstrating the presence of similar precursor levels in each RNA sample (data not shown). Template amplification was assayed in duplicate in each PCR run, for at least three RNA preparations. A melting curve analysis was performed in all PCR runs to check that there were no primer dimers (data not shown). We evaluated the role of the predicted coordination loop, including the EBS3, and the branch site adenosine (Fig. 2A), in RmInt1 excision reaction in vivo, by constructing a series of mutants in pKGEMA4T7. This plasmid contains an RmInt1-ΔORF intron and short flanking exons −20/+5, with a phage T7 promoter inserted in domain IV and the IEP expressed from a position upstream from the 5′ exon. Three mutations were introduced into the branch site: deletion of the adenosine (ΔA764), its replacement by a C residue, and the pairing of this residue with a uridine residue inserted on the other strand of DVI (Fig. 2B), hereafter referred to as ΔA, A764C, and pU, respectively. We also introduced mutations into the coordination loop: one mutation affecting either side of the loop sequence and a third mutation affecting both sides (Fig. 2C), equivalent to the coordination loop mutants generated for in vitro studies in ai5γ (8Hamill S. Pyle A.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 831-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 5′ side loop mutation (CL1) includes nucleotides 222–226 and results in the replacement of a GAGGA sequence with AGCCC. This mutation prevents base pairing between the two sides of the loop. The mutation on the 3′ side of the loop sequence (CL2) involved the replacement of the A in position 330 with a C residue. A combined mutant (CL3) in which both sides of the loop were affected was also generated. Finally, G329 (EBS3) was replaced separately with C, U, and A residues, preventing EBS3-IBS3 base pairing. None of these mutations altered the identity of nucleotide δ′ (C227) that presumably form a canonical pair with nucleotide δ (G266), immediately 5′ of EBS1, interaction that facilitate base pairing between the 5′ exon and the intron (23Costa M. Michel F. Westhof E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5007-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We assessed the efficiency of the intron excision reaction by carrying out primer extension analyses with an oligonucleotide sequence (see supplemental Table 1) complementary to a sequence located 80–97 nt from the 5′ end of the intron (Fig. 3A). Assays with total RNA from S. meliloti RMO17 expressing the RmInt1 intron from pKGEMA4T7 showed a major, strong 97-nt extension product corresponding to excised intron RNA (Fig. 3A, lane 8). This 97-nt band was not detected with RNA from cells harboring pKG4dVT7 (Fig. 3A, lane 9), in which the ribozyme carries mutations affecting the critical conserved AGC-GUU pairing of the intron RNA domain V (GUU→CGA). Similarly, all of the branch site point mutations (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3) resulted in a lack of detectable excision, even after long periods of exposure, suggesting an inability of the intron to branch efficiently and to form a lariat. These branch site substitutions are known to prevent branching and lead to the relatively inefficient production of linear intron molecules in other introns (6Podar M. Chu V.T. Pyle A.M. Perlman P.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, no linear intron RNA was detected in RmInt1 branch site mutants by primer extension, 5′-RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA 5′ ends (RLM-RACE) or cRT-PCR. By contrast to branch point mutants, some of the putative branch site receptor mutants gave a band corresponding to the excision product. The CL2 mutant, in which the 3′ side of the loop was affected, displayed ∼8% wild-type splicing activity (Fig. 3A, lane 5), whereas the 5′-loop mutant CL1 (Fig. 3A, lane 4) displayed a stronger splicing defect (∼4% wild-type). The band generated on intron excision was not detected in the combined mutant, CL3 (Fig. 3A, lane 6). These results are consistent with those reported for similar mutations in the coordination loop of ai5γ in vitro (8Hamill S. Pyle A.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 831-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the branch site receptor mutations have effects on the structure of the ribozyme leading to the splicing defect observed in vivo for RmInt1, rather than specifically affecting the branching reaction. The EBS3-IBS3 interaction stabilizes and aligns the 3′ exon during the second step of splicing. Substitutions affecting EBS3, the binding site for the 3′ exon, have been shown to have minimal effects on the structure of the loop but strongly inhibit the second step of the splicing reaction (23Costa M. Michel F. Westhof E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5007-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been suggested that the branch site and the 3′ exon bind the coordination loop independently (8Hamill S. Pyle A.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 831-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The EBS3C, U, and A mutations (Fig. 3A, lane 7 and data not shown) resulted in significantly lower levels of excision product (∼30–40% wild-type), which nonetheless remained higher than those for the other loop mutants. According to previous observations, our results would involve a different type of impairment of lariat formation in the EBS3 mutant. Although the CL mutants could derivate from structural destabilization that reduces the efficiency of the first step of the splicing reaction, the EBS3 mutants presumably display inhibition of the second step. Branching reaction is highly reversible (24Augustin S. Müller M.W. Schweyen R.J. Nature. 1990; 343: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Chin K. Pyle A.M. RNA. 1995; 1: 391-406PubMed Google Scholar), which requires that the second step of splicing serve as a kinetic trap (25Chin K. Pyle A.M. RNA. 1995; 1: 391-406PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the impairment in the second step of splicing in the EBS3 mutant could contribute to the reversibility in the first step giving rise to a reduction of excision product detected by primer extension. In a previous work, we demonstrated, by RT-PCR, the existence in vivo of RmInt1 RNA molecules compatible with circular intron forms in which the first G residue of the intron is linked to its last C residue (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RT-PCR assays (Fig. 3B) were carried out to determine the ability of the mutants to generate these intron forms. Two major RT-PCR products of 156 and 150 nt were observed in cells expressing the wild-type intron from pKGEMA4T7 (Fig. 3B, lane 16), but not in cells expressing the splicing-defective mutant pKG4dVT7 (Fig. 3B, lane 18). The more slowly migrating 156-nt band corresponds to the amplification of templates in which the 5′and 3′ extremities of the intron are joined together, whereas the 150-nt RT-PCR product is derived from a substrate consisting of an intron lariat in which the branch point is the bulged adenosine in domain VI (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The intron lariat and putative intron circles molecules seem to have different hydrodynamic properties that may be influenced by both the type of folding of the different excised intron molecules and a distinctive interaction of these forms with the IEP (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the degradation rate of both intron molecules is currently unknown, we observed that the amount of putative circles decreased when cells were collected at stationary phase, whereas the levels of lariat were unchanged or slightly raised (data not shown). For this reason, our experiments were carried out at early logarithmic phase. Thus, the conclusions in the current work rest on the assumption that degradation rates are unchanged. RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of the larger RT-PCR product in the three branch-site mutants (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 4, and 6), whereas the product derived from the lariat was barely detectable only in the A764C mutant (lane 4), consistent with the low efficiency of cytosine as the branch point nucleotide demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo in other introns (6Podar M. Chu V.T. Pyle A.M. Perlman P.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Query C.C. Strobel S.A. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1392-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Liu Q. Green J.B. Khodadadi A. Haeberli P. Beigelman L. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The larger RT-PCR products of ΔA, A764C, and pU mutants were cloned and sequenced. All the clones displayed the expected linkage between the first and last residue of the intron. Therefore, we conclude that the production of RNA molecules with joined 5′ and 3′ intron ends is independent of the branching reaction. By contrast to what was observed for the branch-site mutations, RT-PCR assays showed the product of the lariat to be present in all coordination loop mutants (Fig. 3B, lanes 8, 10, and 12) at different levels, consistent with the amount of product detected on primer extension analysis. In addition, the product derived from RNA molecules with joined intron extremities was detectable only in the CL2 mutant, suggesting that these intron species may be produced inefficiently by these mutants. PCR and RT-PCR assays revealed the presence of both DNA (Fig. 3B, lane 13) and RNA (Fig. 3B, lane 14) templates with linked 5′ and 3′ intron extremities in the EBS3C mutant, whereas the product derived from the intron lariat is no longer detectable. All cloned 156 nt RT-PCR products displayed the expected linkage between the first G residue of the intron and its last C residue. These results are particularly striking because the extension product (Fig. 3A, lane 7) is thought to be mostly derived from intron lariat molecules. We have shown previously that primer extension assays using RNA and RNP particles from S. meliloti cells expressing the wild-type intron revealed two extension products that differ by one nucleotide (97–98 nt) relative to the position expected for the 5′ end of the intron, with the shorter product as the major one (16Molina-Sánchez M.D. Martinez-Abarca F. Toro N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, primer extension performed on a circular intron has been reported to result in two extension products that differ by one nucleotide, with the longer product as the major one (14Murray H.L. Mikheeva S. Coljee V.W. Turczyk B.M. Donahue W.F. Bar-Shalom A. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reverse transcriptase is known to pause after reading through the 2′–5′ linkage in a nonlariat RNA (28Lorsch J.R. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Nucleic Acids Re"
https://openalex.org/W2047996862,"A plethora of peptides are generated intracellularly, and most peptide-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I interactions are of a transient, unproductive nature. Without a quality control mechanism, the HLA-I system would be stressed by futile attempts to present peptides not sufficient for the stable peptide-HLA-I complex formation required for long term presentation. Tapasin is thought to be central to this essential quality control, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that the N-terminal region of tapasin, Tpn(1-87), assisted folding of peptide-HLA-A*02:01 complexes according to the identity of the peptide. The facilitation was also specific for the identity of the HLA-I heavy chain, where it correlated to established tapasin dependence hierarchies. Two large sets of HLA-A*02:01 binding peptides, one extracted from natural HLA-I ligands from the SYFPEITHI database and one consisting of medium to high affinity non-SYFPEITHI ligands, were studied in the context of HLA-A*02:01 binding and stability. We show that the SYFPEITHI peptides induced more stable HLA-A*02:01 molecules than the other ligands, although affinities were similar. Remarkably, Tpn(1-87) could functionally discriminate the selected SYFPEITHI peptides from the other peptide binders with high sensitivity and specificity. We suggest that this HLA-I- and peptide-specific function, together with the functions exerted by the more C-terminal parts of tapasin, are major features of tapasin-mediated HLA-I quality control. These findings are important for understanding the biogenesis of HLA-I molecules, the selection of presented T-cell epitopes, and the identification of immunogenic targets in both basic research and vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2043633549,"Mammalian glycosphingolipid (GSL) precursor monohexosylceramides are either glucosyl- or galactosylceramide (GlcCer or GalCer). Most GSLs derive from GlcCer. Substitution of the GSL fatty acid with adamantane generates amphipathic mimics of increased water solubility, retaining receptor function. We have synthesized adamantyl GlcCer (adaGlcCer) and adamantyl GalCer (adaGalCer). AdaGlcCer and adaGalCer partition into cells to alter GSL metabolism. At low dose, adaGlcCer increased cellular GSLs by inhibition of glucocerebrosidase (GCC). Recombinant GCC was inhibited at pH 7 but not pH 5. In contrast, adaGalCer stimulated GCC at pH 5 but not pH 7 and, like adaGlcCer, corrected N370S mutant GCC traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes. AdaGalCer reduced GlcCer levels in normal and lysosomal storage disease (LSD) cells. At 40 μM adaGlcCer, lactosylceramide (LacCer) synthase inhibition depleted LacCer (and more complex GSLs), such that only GlcCer remained. In Vero cell microsomes, 40 μM adaGlcCer was converted to adaLacCer, and LacCer synthesis was inhibited. AdaGlcCer is the first cell LacCer synthase inhibitor. At 40 μM adaGalCer, cell synthesis of only Gb(3) and Gb(4) was significantly reduced, and a novel product, adamantyl digalactosylceramide (adaGb(2)), was generated, indicating substrate competition for Gb(3) synthase. AdaGalCer also inhibited cell sulfatide synthesis. Microsomal Gb(3) synthesis was inhibited by adaGalCer. Metabolic labeling of Gb(3) in Fabry LSD cells was selectively reduced by adaGalCer, and adaGb(2) was produced. AdaGb(2) in cells was 10-fold more effectively shed into the medium than the more polar Gb(3), providing an easily eliminated ""safety valve"" alternative to Gb(3) accumulation. Adamantyl monohexosyl ceramides thus provide new tools to selectively manipulate normal cellular GSL metabolism and reduce GSL accumulation in cells from LSD patients."
