https://openalex.org/W3048538582,"The outbreak of COVID-19 across the world has posed unprecedented and global challenges on multiple fronts. Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases and main protease for viral replication. Using the bioinformatics and structural modelling approach, we modelled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H+ ions. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. Additionally, two distinct “core” structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for vaccine development and generating therapeutic interventions against the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3048458853,"To enter a cell and establish infection, HIV must first fuse its lipid envelope with the host cell plasma membrane. Whereas the process of HIV membrane fusion can be tracked by fluorescence microscopy, the 3D configuration of proteins and lipids at intermediate steps can only be resolved with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET). However, cryoET of whole cells is technically difficult. To overcome this problem, we have adapted giant plasma membrane vesicles (or blebs) from native cell membranes expressing appropriate receptors as targets for fusion with HIV envelope glycoprotein-expressing pseudovirus particles with and without Serinc host restriction factors. The fusion behavior of these particles was probed by TIRF microscopy on bleb-derived supported membranes. Timed snapshots of fusion of the same particles with blebs were examined by cryo-ET. The combination of these methods allowed us to characterize the structures of various intermediates on the fusion pathway and showed that when Serinc3 or Serinc5 (but not Serinc2) were present, later fusion products were more prevalent, suggesting that Serinc3/5 act at multiple steps to prevent progression to full fusion. In addition, the antifungal amphotericin B reversed Serinc restriction, presumably by intercalation into the fusing membranes. Our results provide a highly detailed view of Serinc restriction of HIV-cell membrane fusion and thus extend current structural and functional information on Serinc as a lipid-binding protein."

The ATF6 and IRE1/XBP1 pathways are separate ER stress-response effectors important to beta cell health and function. ATF6α. and XBP1 direct overlapping transcriptional responses in some cell types. However, the signaling dynamics and interdependence of ATF6α and XBP1 in pancreatic beta cells have not been explored. To assess pathway-specific signal onset, we performed timed exposures of primary mouse islet cells to ER stressors and measured the early transcriptional response. Comparing the time course of induction of ATF6 and XBP1 targets suggested that the two pathways have similar response dynamics. The role of ATF6α in target induction was assessed by acute knockdown using islet cells from Atf6αflox/flox mice transduced with adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Surprisingly, given the mild impact of chronic deletion in mice, acute ATF6α knockdown markedly reduced ATF6-pathway target gene expression under both basal and stressed conditions. Intriguingly, although ATF6α knockdown did not alter Xbp1 splicing dynamics or intensity, it did reduce induction of XBP1 targets. Inhibition of Xbp1 splicing did not decrease induction of ATF6α targets. Taken together, these data suggest that the XBP1 and ATF6 pathways are simultaneously activated in islet cells in response to acute stress and that ATF6α is required for full activation of XBP1 targets, but XBP1 is not required for activation of ATF6α targets. These observations improve understanding of the ER stress transcriptional response in pancreatic islets.

Understanding the normal beta cell response to stress is critical to learning more about how beta cells fail. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is the primary mechanism of cellular adaptation to ER stress. The UPR is an elegant multipathway stress-response initiated when unfolded peptides recruit chaperone GRP78 away from ER transmembrane proteins PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, allowing them to activate downstream signals (7Back S.H. Kaufman R.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and type 2 diabetes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 (22443930): 767-79310.1146/annurev-biochem-072909-095555Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). PERK activation results in phosphorylation of eIF2α, which slows translation of certain proteins to decrease new peptide translocation into the ER (7Back S.H. Kaufman R.J.

ATF6 pathway members are bZip transcription factors, the most studied of which is ATF6α. When released from GRP78, ATF6α, a single-pass ER transmembrane protein, translocates to the Golgi where a cleavage event releases a cytoplasmic domain which is a potent but short-lived transcription factor (6Sharma R.B.

The dynamics of ATF6 and XBP1 pathway activation in beta cells following stress are currently unknown; similarly, whether these pathways cooperatively regulate genes in beta cells has not been tested. The goals of this study were to define how pancreatic islet cells activate known ATF6α and XBP1 pathway transcriptional targets in response to ER stress, focusing on the time course of induction and any interdependence of the pathways. Primary mouse islet cells were tested using two parallel chemical stressor paradigms with subtly different onset of action to sensitively probe ATF6 and XBP1 stress-response dynamics. The results suggest that the transcriptional response to the ATF6 and XBP1 pathways occurs simultaneously in islet cells. XBP1 target induction depended upon ATF6α, whereas the converse was not true. Taken together, these results clarify the molecular dynamics and interdependence of the ATF6 and XBP1 pathways in mouse islet cells. To assess the time frame of activation of the ATF6 and XBP1 pathways, we designed experiments to capture the early response after acute stress induction. Building on our prior work (2Sharma R.B. O'Donnell A.C. Stamateris R.E. Ha B. McCloskey K.M. Reynolds P.R. Arvan P. Alonso L.C. Insulin demand regulates β cell number via the unfolded protein response.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 (26389675): 3831-384610.1172/JCI79264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we isolated pancreatic islets from normal healthy adult male and female C57BL/6J mice, allowed them to recover from the stress of isolation, and then dispersed and plated the islet cells on plastic. Because we consistently observe an unexplained integrated stress response suggesting nutrient depletion when we plate dispersed islet cells in 5 mm glucose (Ref. 2Sharma R.B. O'Donnell A.C. Stamateris R.E. Ha B. McCloskey K.M. Reynolds P.R. Arvan P. Alonso L.C. Insulin demand regulates β cell number via the unfolded protein response.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 (26389675): 3831-384610.1172/JCI79264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and data not shown), these experiments were performed in nutrient-replete conditions with 15 mm glucose for 72 h (Fig. 1a). In separate experiments, we determined that culture media glucose concentration does not meaningfully decline during 72 h of islet cell culture (Fig. S1). To assess whether islet dispersion impacts the stress response, we performed parallel experiments in whole islets. Two different stress paradigms were studied: thapsigargin, which causes ER calcium depletion stress, and tunicamycin, which causes ER glycosylation stress. Both chemicals were applied in relatively high doses to achieve robust acute activation. To confirm ER stress, we quantified splicing of the Xbp1 transcript, an early event in activation of the XBP1 pathway. Following thapsigargin exposure, spliced Xbp1 (sXbp1) levels increased rapidly within 1 h, accompanied by an equally rapid decrease in unspliced Xbp1 (uXbp1) (Fig. 1, b and c). However, following tunicamycin exposure, the increase in sXbp1 and decrease in uXbp1 levels were slower, not reaching maximal activation until 4–6 h (Fig. 1, d and e). Quantification of band intensity confirmed that thapsigargin exposure activated Xbp1 splicing earlier than tunicamycin (Fig. 1, f–i). The relative ratio of spliced/unspliced Xbp1 (s/uXbp1) also demonstrated this pattern (Fig. 1, j and k). Perhaps surprisingly, the time course of Xbp1 splicing was quite similar in whole islets and dispersed islet cells. The abundance of Grp78 transcript, a sensitive readout of ER stress response that is induced by both ATF6 and XBP1 pathways (30Shoulders M.D. Ryno L.M. Genereux J.C. Moresco J.J. Tu P.G. Wu C.

In sum, these conditions allowed a sensitive mapping of the early response to ER stress in mouse islet cells using two different stresses with onset ranging from 1 to 4 h.Figure 1A sensitive system to detect the time course and intensity of islet cell response to ER stress. a, mouse islet dispersed cells (left panels) or whole islets (right panels) were plated, allowed to recover for 1 day, and then cultured in 15 mm glucose medium for 2 days before addition of 1000 nm Tg (black lines in f–m) or 2000 ng/ml Tm (green lines in f–m) for 1–24 h before RNA isolation. b–e, a gel-based assay was used to quantify the time course of Xbp1 splicing over 24 h of stress induced by Tg (b and c) or Tm (d and e). f–m, unspliced Xbp1 (uXbp1; f and g) or spliced Xbp1 (sXbp1; h and i) were quantified relative to Actin abundance or as the ratio of s/uXbp1 (j and k).

Similar to Grp78, induction of ATF6 targets by tunicamycin was delayed relative to induction by thapsigargin. This difference was more evident in dispersed islet cells than in whole islets, but the results were statistically similar between the two, possibly related to subtle differences in drug responses in whole islets in the early time points (Fig. S2). One target, Herpud1, consistently rose earlier than the others, suggesting a different mechanism of activation (Fig. 2, c and d). All three XBP1 targets tested were also increased in islet cells and whole islets by ER stressors; induction of all three were slightly earlier for thapsigargin than tunicamycin (Fig. 2, i–n). Intriguingly, although some ATF6 target induction was slower (Fig. 2, a and b) or faster (Fig. 2, c and d), on the whole the timing of XBP1 target increase was very similar to the timing of ATF6 target increase. Taken together, the ATF6 and XBP1 pathways seem to be simultaneously activated during acute ER stress in mouse islet cells. ATF6 pathway members include a family of ER transmembrane proteins that are activated in SREBP1-like fashion by cleavage in the Golgi, leading to release of a transcription factor (38Kondo S.

Transducing Atf6αflox/flox islet cells with an adenovirus expressing Cre (Fig. 3a) markedly reduced Atf6α mRNA levels relative to control LacZ-transduced cultures (Fig. 3b), suggesting successful knockdown. ATF6α knockdown modestly reduced mRNA abundance of ATF6 pathway targets Grp78, Hyou1, Herpud1, and Pdia4 under basal conditions (Fig. 3c), suggesting tonic ATF6 pathway activation, mediated by ATF6α, in glucose-replete culture conditions. Abundance of mRNA of PERK pathway members Atf4 and Chop were unchanged by Atf6α knockdown (Fig. 3d), confirming selectivity of the response. Intriguingly, contrary to our expectation that knockdown of Atf6α might induce a compensatory increase in expression of Atf6β, levels actually decreased (Fig. 3e). To assess the role of ATF6α in the islet cell response to acute stress, the early induction of ATF6 pathway targets was quantified after ATF6α knockdown. Although Atf6α itself was strongly induced by thapsigargin in control islet cells, it remained low in Cre-transduced cultures, confirming ongoing effective knockdown (Fig. 4a). Induction of ATF6 pathway targets over the first 6 h of ER stress was markedly blunted by ATF6α knockdown (Fig. 4, b–e). When the duration of stress was extended to 24 h, the impact of ATF6α knockdown was still evident, although most genes showed some continued increase for both thapsigargin and tunicamycin (Fig. 4, f–m). This was despite lack of meaningful recovery of Atf6α transcript abundance (Fig. 4, n and o). Atf6β levels were found to increase after ER stress, in a strong"

Medical students are one of the high-risk groups for suicide. This increased risk may begin during medical school and leads to premature death. But, there is a paucity of epidemiologically reliable data on the issue. Therefore, the current study was aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideations and attempt among undergraduate medical students of Haramaya University.An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 13 to June 12, 2019 at College of Health and Medical Science, Haramaya University. Stratified sampling technique was used and a total of 757 participants were selected by using simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Suicidal ideation and attempt were assessed by using suicidal module of world mental health survey initiative version of the World Health Organization, composite international diagnostic interview. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science Version 20. Descriptive results were presented by tables and graphs. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and the strength of association was presented by an adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.The study showed that the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt were 23.7% (95%CI, 20.5-26.8) and 3.9% (95%CI, 2.6-5.5), respectively. Cumulative grade point average (AOR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.18-0.49), current alcohol use (AOR = 2.26, 95%CI: 1.45-3.55), depression (AOR = 3.58, 95%CI: 2.23-5.76), anxiety (AOR = 3, 95%CI: 1.88-4.77), and poor social support (AOR = 2.57, 95%CI: 1.41-4.68) were the factors statistically associated with the suicidal ideation. Depression (AOR = 5.4, 95%CI: 1.45-20.14) and anxiety (AOR = 3.19, 95%CI: 1.01-10.18) were associated with the suicidal attempts.This study showed that the high prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt as compared to the prevalence of suicidal behavior among other university students who were studying in other fields. Cumulative Grade Point Average, current alcohol use, depression, anxiety and poor social support were the factors statistically associated with the suicidal ideation. Depression and anxiety were the ones associated with the suicidal attempt. Early screening, detection and management of suicidal behavior and associated mental health problems were recommended for undergraduate medical students."
https://openalex.org/W3048622688,"Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) is a putative biomarker of oxidative stress and biological aging. Modifiable factors, including physical activity (PA), avoidance of heavy alcohol use and smoking, and maintaining good mental health, may reduce oxidative stress and promote healthy aging. Yet, limited data exist regarding how these factors are associated with mtDNAcn or whether age, sex or race/ethnicity moderate associations. In this cross-sectional study, we selected 391 adults (183 non-Hispanic White, 110 Black and 98 Hispanic; mean = 67 years) from the VITAL-DEP (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL-Depression Endpoint Prevention) ancillary to the VITAL trial. We estimated associations between lifestyle and behavioral factors (PA, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and depression) and log-transformed mtDNAcn using multivariable linear regression models. MtDNAcn was not correlated with chronological age; women had ~17% higher mtDNAcn compared to men. There were no significant associations between PA measures (frequency, amount or intensity) or alcohol consumption with mtDNAcn. Cigarette smoking (per 5 pack-years) was significantly associated with mtDNAcn (percent difference = -2.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = -5.4%, -0.4%)); a large contrast was observed among heavy vs. non-smokers (≥30 vs. 0 pack-years): percent difference = -28.5% (95% CI = -44.2%, -8.3%). The estimate of mtDNAcn was suggestively different for past vs. no depression history (percent difference = -15.1% 95% CI = -30.8%, 4.1%), but this difference was not statistically significant. The association between smoking and log-mtDNAcn varied by sex and race/ethnicity; it was stronger in men and Black participants. While chance findings cannot be excluded, results from this study support associations of smoking, but not chronological age, with mtDNAcn and suggest nuanced considerations of mtDNAcn as indicative of varying oxidative stress states vs. biological aging itself."
https://openalex.org/W3048466163,"Mineral precipitation via microbial activity is a well-known process with applications in various fields. This relevance of microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has pushed researchers to explore various naturally occurring MICP capable bacterial strains. The present study was performed to explore the efficiency of microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) via locally isolated bacterial strains and role of guar gum, which is a naturally occurring polymer, on the MICP process. The strains were isolated from local soil and screened for urease activity Further, the urease positive strain was subjected to urea and calcium chloride based medium to investigate the efficacy of isolated strain for microbial induced precipitation. Among screened isolates, the soil bacterium that showed urease positive behaviour and precipitated calcium carbonate was subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This strain was identified as Bacillus velezensis. Guar gum—a natural polymer, was used as a sole carbon source to enhance the MICP process. It was observed that the isolated strain was able to breakdown the guar gum into simple sugars resulting in two-fold increase in calcium carbonate precipitate. Major bio-chemical activities of isolated strain pertaining to MICP such as ammonium ion concentration, pH profiling, and total reducing sugar with time were explored under four different concentrations of guar gum (0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1% w/v). Maximum ammonium ion concentration (17.5 μg/ml) and increased pH was observed with 1% guar gum supplementation, which confirms augmented MICP activity of the bacterial strain. Microstructural analysis of microbial precipitation was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, which confirmed the presence of calcium carbonate in different phases. Further, XRD and SEM based studies corroborated that guar gum supplemented media showed significant increase in stable calcite phase as compared to media without guar gum supplementation. Significant diverse group of nitrogenous compounds were observed in guar gum supplemented medium when subjected to Gas Chromatography–Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) profiling."
https://openalex.org/W3048509884,"Hybrid performance during wheat breeding can be improved by analyzing genetic distance (GD) among wheat genotypes and determining its correlation with heterosis. This study evaluated the GD between 16 wheat genotypes by using 60 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to classify them according to their relationships and select those with greater genetic diversity, evaluate the correlation of the SSR marker distance with heterotic performance and specific combining ability (SCA) for heat stress tolerance, and identify traits that most influence grain yield (GY). Eight parental genotypes with greater genetic diversity and their 28 F1 hybrids generated using diallel crossing were evaluated for 12 measured traits in two seasons. The GD varied from 0.235 to 0.911 across the 16 genotypes. Cluster analysis based on the GD estimated using SSRs classified the genotypes into three major groups and six sub-groups, almost consistent with the results of principal coordinate analysis. The combined data indicated that five hybrids showed 20% greater yield than mid-parent or better-parent. Two hybrids (P2 × P4) and (P2 × P5), which showed the highest performance of days to heading (DH), grain filling duration (GFD), and GY, and had large genetic diversity among themselves (0.883 and 0.911, respectively), were deemed as promising heat-tolerant hybrids. They showed the best mid-parent heterosis and better-parent heterosis (BPH) for DH (-11.57 and -7.65%; -13.39 and -8.36%, respectively), GFD (12.74 and 12.17%; 12.09 and 10.59%, respectively), and GY (36.04 and 20.04%; 44.06 and 37.73%, respectively). Correlation between GD and each of BPH and SCA effects based on SSR markers was significantly positive for GFD, hundred kernel weight, number of kernels per spike, harvest index, GY, and grain filling rate and was significantly negative for DH. These correlations indicate that the performance of wheat hybrids with high GY and earliness could be predicted by determining the GD of the parents by using SSR markers. Multivariate analysis (stepwise regression and path coefficient) suggested that GFD, hundred kernel weight, days to maturity, and number of kernels per spike had the highest influence on GY."
https://openalex.org/W3048591595,"Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most prevalent illness encountered by deployed military personnel and has a major impact on military operations, from reduced job performance to lost duty days. Frequently, the etiology of TD is unknown and, with underreporting of cases, it is difficult to accurately assess its impact. An increasing number of ailments include an altered or aberrant gut microbiome. To better understand the relationships between long-term deployments and TD, we studied military personnel during two nine-month deployment cycles in 2015-2016 to Honduras. To collect data on the prevalence of diarrhea and impact on duty, a total of 1173 personnel completed questionnaires at the end of their deployment. 56.7% reported reduced performance and 21.1% reported lost duty days. We conducted a passive surveillance study of all cases of diarrhea reporting to the medical unit with 152 total cases and a similar pattern of etiology. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 52/152), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC, 50/152), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC, 35/152) were the most prevalent pathogens detected. An active longitudinal surveillance of 67 subjects also identified diarrheagenic E. coli as the primary etiology (7/16 EPEC, 7/16 EAEC, and 6/16 ETEC). Eleven subjects were recruited into a nested longitudinal substudy to examine gut microbiome changes associated with deployment. A 16S rRNA amplicon survey of fecal samples showed differentially abundant baseline taxa for subjects who contracted TD versus those who did not, as well as detection of taxa positively associated with self-reported gastrointestinal distress. Disrupted microbiota was also qualitatively observable for weeks preceding and following the incidents of TD. These findings illustrate the complex etiology of diarrhea amongst military personnel in deployed settings and its impacts on job performance. Potential factors of resistance or susceptibility can provide a foundation for future clinical trials to evaluate prevention and treatment strategies."

The aim of this study was to investigate factors influencing prescription of systemic treatments for patients with psoriasis with a special focus on socioeconomic factors.This was a non-interventional, cross-sectional study, conducted in 18 Italian University and/or hospital centers with psoriasis-specialized units. Questionnaires evaluating demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were administered to participants. Overall, 1880 consecutive patients affected by mild-to-severe psoriasis were recruited. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses of systemic therapy prescription, with a special focus on biologics, accounting for the above mentioned characteristics were performed. Our analysis showed that all analyzed patients' characteristics were significantly associated with biological therapy compared to non-biological systemic one. Particularly, women were less likely to receive biologics than men (OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.77). Elderly patients (≥65 years) and subjects with a BMI ≥30 had lower odds to receive biologics respect to adults (≥35-64 years) (OR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25-0.40), and subjects with BMI≥25<30 (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.77), respectively. Northern and Southern patients were both less likely to receive biologics than Central patients (OR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.89, and OR = 0.56; 95% CI,0.47-0.68, respectively). Lower economic profile and never reading books were both associated with decreased odds of receiving biological therapy.This study shows that sex, age, comorbidities, and socioeconomic characteristics influence the prescription of systemic treatments in psoriasis, highlighting that there are still unmet needs influencing the therapeutic decision-making process that have to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W3048959948,"Social media has made it possible to manipulate the masses via disinformation and fake news at an unprecedented scale. This is particularly alarming from a security perspective, as humans have proven to be one of the weakest links when protecting critical infrastructure in general, and the power grid in particular. Here, we consider an attack in which an adversary attempts to manipulate the behavior of energy consumers by sending fake discount notifications encouraging them to shift their consumption into the peak-demand period. Using Greater London as a case study, we show that such disinformation can indeed lead to unwitting consumers synchronizing their energy-usage patterns, and result in blackouts on a city-scale if the grid is heavily loaded. We then conduct surveys to assess the propensity of people to follow-through on such notifications and forward them to their friends. This allows us to model how the disinformation may propagate through social networks, potentially amplifying the attack impact. These findings demonstrate that in an era when disinformation can be weaponized, system vulnerabilities arise not only from the hardware and software of critical infrastructure, but also from the behavior of the consumers."
https://openalex.org/W3048562479,"Cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a widely expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein. Scrapie prion protein is a misfolded and aggregated form of PrPC responsible for prion-induced neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the function of the nonpathogenic PrPC monomer is an important objective. PrPC may be shed from the cell surface to generate soluble derivatives. Herein, we studied a recombinant derivative of PrPC (soluble cellular prion protein, S-PrP) that corresponds closely in sequence to a soluble form of PrPC shed from the cell surface by proteases in the A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM) family. S-PrP activated cell-signaling in PC12 and N2a cells. TrkA was transactivated by Src family kinases and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was activated downstream of Trk receptors. These cell-signaling events were dependent on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), which functioned as a cell-signaling receptor system in lipid rafts. Membrane-anchored PrPC and neural cell adhesion molecule were not required for S-PrP-initiated cell-signaling. S-PrP promoted PC12 cell neurite outgrowth. This response required the NMDA-R, LRP1, Src family kinases, and Trk receptors. In Schwann cells, S-PrP interacted with the LRP1/NMDA-R system to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and promote cell migration. The effects of S-PrP on PC12 cell neurite outgrowth and Schwann cell migration were similar to those caused by other proteins that engage the LRP1/NMDA-R system, including activated α2-macroglobulin and tissue-type plasminogen activator. Collectively, these results demonstrate that shed forms of PrPC may exhibit important biological activities in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system by serving as ligands for the LRP1/NMDA-R system."

However, the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear.We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the presence of tumor-infiltrating FoxP3⁺ T-cells and CTLA-4⁺ cells in four distinct histological compartments (tumor parenchyma and stroma at the tumor center, and parenchyma and stroma at the invasive front) and assessed the association between the prevalence of these cells and the histopathological status of 137 patients with OSCC.Five-year overall survival, disease-specific survival, and recurrence-free survival were favorable in patients with high numbers of FoxP3⁺ T-cells in the parenchyma of the invasive front. Recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival were decreased in patients with high numbers of CTLA-4⁺ cells in the parenchyma of the invasive front.The presence of FoxP3⁺ T-cells in the parenchyma of the invasive front may be a useful prognostic factor. Our results indicate that FoxP3⁺ T-cells may exert site-specific anti-tumor effects but may not play an immunosuppressive role in OSCC. In addition, our results suggest that CTLA-4+ cells suppress the function of FoxP3+ T-cells and promote anti-tumor immunity in OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3048711029,"Podocyte injury is the primary cause of glomerular injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), the triggers and markers of oxidative stress in DN, have been linked to podocyte damage. However, the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we investigated the potential role of FOXO3a, a key transcription factor in the response to stress, in mediating AOPPs-induced podocyte injury. We found that FOXO3a expression was increased in the glomeruli of kidney biopsies from patients with DN and it was positively correlated with proteinuria. The serum from patients with DN significantly increased FOXO3a and its downstream genes FasL and Bim, thereby inducing the high level of cleaved caspase3 and the loss of nephrin and podocin expressions in podocytes. Blockade of AOPPs signaling by a neutralizing antibody against the receptor of advanced glycation end products (αRAGE) abolished the effect of DN serum on podocytes, confirming the pathogenic role of AOPPs in DN serum. Downregulation of FOXO3a decreased AOPPs-induced podocyte apoptosis and restored the levels of podocyte markers nephrin and podocin, and upregulation of FOXO3a exacerbated these changes in podocytes after AOPPs treatment. Furthermore, FOXO3a specifically activated proapoptotic genes in podocytes only in the presence of AOPPs. Mechanistically, AOPPs increased the FOXO3a protein levels by inhibiting their autophagic degradation in a ROS/mTOR-dependent manner. Moreover AOPPs activated the accumulated FOXO3a by maintaining FOXO3a in the nucleus, and this process was dependent on ROS-mediated AKT signaling deactivation. These studies suggest that FOXO3a plays a critical role in mediating AOPPs-induced podocyte injury and reveal a new mechanistic linkage of oxidative stress, FOXO3a activation and podocyte injury in DN."
https://openalex.org/W3048721146,"Airborne spatial repellency (SR) is characterized and distinguished from other chemical actions including contact locomotor excitation and toxicity. The use of volatile spatial repellents is a potential new intervention class for combatting mosquito-borne pathogen transmission; therefore, continuing investigations on the actions of these chemicals that modify mosquito host-seeking behavior (i.e., bite prevention) is needed. The objective of this study is to characterize the key behavioral avoidance actions of transfluthrin (TFT) to advance spatial repellent development into practical products. Behavioral avoidance responses were observed for adult laboratory strains of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles minimus and An. dirus, and two field populations of An. harrisoni and Ae. aegypti, respectively. Established TFT sublethal (LC50 and LC75), lethal concentrations (LC99) and discriminating concentrations (DCs) were selected corresponding to each mosquito test species. Spatial repellency and contact excitation ('irritancy') responses on adult mosquitoes to TFT were assessed using an excito-repellency assay system. At LC50, TFT exhibited strong avoidance with An. minimus (60.1% escape) and An. dirus (80% escape) laboratory strains, showing between 12 and 16x greater escape response than Ae. aegypti (5% escape). Repellency responses for field collected Ae. aegypti and An. harrisoni were 54.9 and 47.1% escape, respectively. After adjusting the initial contact escape response (a measure of combined irritancy and repellency) to estimate only escape due to contact, the LC50 and LC99 showed moderate escape irritancy with laboratory Ae. aegypti (41.4% escape) and no contact activity against the field population. Adjustment showed only weak contact activity (16.1% escape) in laboratory An. minimus at LC50. Spatial repellency is the predominant mode of action of TFT among colonized and field mosquitoes used in this study. Established baseline (susceptible) dose-response curves assist in optimizing SR products for mosquito control and pathogen transmission prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3048644983,"Both costs and benefits must be considered when implementing marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly those associated with fishing effort displaced by potential closures. The Southern Ocean offers a case study in understanding such tradeoffs, where MPAs are actively being discussed to achieve a range of protection and sustainable use objectives. Here, we evaluated the possible impacts of two MPA scenarios on the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and krill-dependent predators in the Scotia Sea, explicitly addressing the displacement of fishing from closed areas. For both scenarios, we employed a minimally realistic, spatially explicit ecosystem model and considered three alternative redistributions of displaced fishing. We projected both MPAs to provide positive outcomes for many krill-dependent predators, especially when closed areas included at least 50–75% of their foraging distributions. Further, differences between the scenarios suggest ways to improve seal and penguin protection in the Scotia Sea. MPA scenarios also projected increases in total fishery yields, but alongside risks of fishing in areas where relatively low krill densities could cause the fishery to suspend operations. The three alternatives for redistributing displaced fishing had little effect on benefits to predators, but did matter for the fishery, with greater differences in overall catch and risk of fishing in areas of low krill density when displaced fishing was redistributed evenly among the open areas. Collectively, results suggest a well-designed MPA in the Scotia Sea may protect krill-dependent predators, even with displaced fishing, and preclude further spatial management of the krill fishery outside the MPA. More broadly, outcomes denote the importance of delineating fishing and predator habitat, spatial scales, and the critical trade-offs inherent in MPA development."
https://openalex.org/W3048673213,"Objective To determine which county-level social, economic, demographic, epidemiologic and access to care factors are associated with Latino/non-Latino White disparities in prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection. Methods and findings We used 2016 county-level prevalence rates of diagnosed HIV infection rates for Latinos and non-Latino Whites obtained from the National HIV Surveillance System and factors obtained from multiple publicly available datasets. We used mixed effects Poisson modeling of observed HIV prevalence at the county-level to identify county-level factors that explained homogeneous effects across race/ethnicity and differential effects for Latinos and NL-Whites. Overall, the median Latinos disparity in HIV prevalence is 2.4; 94% of the counties have higher rates for Latinos than non-Latinos, and one-quarter of the counties’ disparities exceeded 10. Of the 41 county-level factors examined, 24 showed significant effect modification when examined individually. In multi-variable modeling, 11 county-level factors were found that significantly affected disparities. Factors that increased disparity with higher, compared to lower values included proportion of HIV diagnoses due to injection drug use, percent Latino living in poverty, percent not English proficient, and percent Puerto Rican. Latino disparities increased with decreasing percent severe housing, drug overdose mortality rate, percent rural, female prevalence rate, social association rate, percent change in Latino population, and Latino to NL-White proportion of the population. These factors while significant had minimal effects on diminishing disparity, but did substantially reduce the variance in disparity rates. Conclusions Large differences in HIV prevalence rates persist across almost all counties even after controlling for county-level factors. Counties that are more rural, have fewer Latinos, or have lower NL-White prevalence rates tend to have higher disparities. There is also higher disparity when community risk is low."
https://openalex.org/W3048592358,"Bacterial pore-forming toxin aerolysin-like proteins are widely distributed in animals and plants. Emerging evidence supports their roles in host innate immunity, but their direct actions in adaptive immunity remain elusive. In this study, we found that βγ-CAT, an aerolysin-like protein and trefoil factor complex identified in the frog Bombina maxima, modulated several steps of endocytic pathways during dendritic cell antigen presentation. The protein augmented the antigen uptake of dendritic cells and actively neutralized the acidification of cellular endocytic organelles to favor antigen presentation. In addition, the release of functional exosome-like extracellular vesicles was largely enhanced in the presence of βγ-CAT. The cellular action of βγ-CAT increased the number of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-ovalbumin and MHC II molecules on dendritic cell surfaces and the released exosome-like extracellular vesicles. An enhanced antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cell for priming of naive T cells was detected in the presence of βγ-CAT. Collectively, these effects led to strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and antigen-specific antibody responses. Our findings provide evidence that a vertebrate-secreted pore-forming protein can augment antigen presentation by directly modulating cellular endocytic and exocytic pathways, leading to robust activation of adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3048422919,"Estimating incidence from cross-sectional data sources is both important to the understanding of the HIV epidemic and challenging from a methodological standpoint. We develop a new incidence estimator that measures the size of the undiagnosed population and the amount of time spent undiagnosed in order to infer incidence and transmission rates. The estimator is calculated using commonly collected information on testing history and HIV status and, thus, can be deployed in many HIV surveys without additional cost. If ART biomarker status and/or viral load information is available, the estimator can be adjusted for biases in self-reported testing history. The performance of the estimator is explored in two large surveys in Kenya, where we find our point estimates to be consistent with assay-derived estimates, with much smaller standard errors."
https://openalex.org/W3048663643,"Troll internet messages, especially those posted on Twitter, have recently been recognised as a very powerful weapon in hybrid warfare. Hence, an important task for the academic community is to provide a tool for identifying internet troll accounts as quickly as possible. At the same time, this tool must be highly accurate so that its employment will not violate people's rights and affect the freedom of speech. Though such a task can be effectively fulfilled on purely linguistic grounds, as of yet, very little work has been done that could help to explain the discourse-specific features of this type of writing. In this paper, we suggest a quantitative measure for identifying troll messages which is based on taking into account certain sociolinguistic limitations of troll speech, and discuss two algorithms that both require as few as 50 tweets to establish the true nature of the tweets, whether 'genuine' or 'troll-like'."
https://openalex.org/W3048368303,"Iron Overload Disorder (IOD) is a syndrome developed by captive browsing rhinoceroses like black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis), in which hemosiderosis develops in vital organs while free iron accumulates in the body, potentially predisposing to various secondary diseases. Captive grazing species like white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) do not seem to be affected. The authors hypothesized that inflammation and oxidative stress may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IOD in captive black rhinoceroses, making this syndrome a potential common denominator to various diseases described in captivity in this species. In this prospective study, 15 black (BR) and 29 white rhinoceroses (WR) originating from 22 European zoos were blood-sampled and compared for their iron status (serum iron), liver/muscle biochemical parameters (AST, GGT, cholesterol), inflammatory status (total proteins, protein electrophoresis) and oxidative stress markers (SOD, GPX, dROMs). Results showed higher serum iron and liver enzyme levels in black rhinoceroses (P < 0.01), as well as higher dROMs (P < 0.01) and a trend for higher GPX (P = 0.06) levels. The albumin/globulin ratio was lower in black rhinoceroses (P < 0.05) due to higher α2-globulin levels (P < 0.001). The present study suggests a higher inflammatory and oxidative profile in captive BR than in WR, possibly in relation to iron status. This could be either a consequence or a cause of iron accumulation. Further investigations are needed to assess the prognostic value of the inflammatory and oxidative markers in captive black rhinoceroses, particularly for evaluating the impact of reduced-iron and antioxidant-supplemented diets."
https://openalex.org/W3048461103,"Active learning pedagogies decrease failure rates in undergraduate introductory biology courses, but these practices also cause anxiety for some students. Classroom anxiety can impact student learning and has been associated with decreased student retention in the major, but little is known about how students cope with anxiety caused by active learning practices. In this study, we investigated student coping strategies for various types of active learning (clickers, volunteering to answer a question, cold calling, and group work) that were used in 13 introductory Biology courses at a large public university in 2016-2017. A survey asked students to rate their anxiety regarding the four active learning practices and over half of the students explained the coping strategies they used to manage their active learning anxieties. Coping responses from 880 students were sorted into pre-defined categories of coping strategies: problem solving, information seeking, self-reliance, support seeking, accommodation, helplessness, escape, delegation, and isolation. We found that a different category of coping was dominant for each type of active learning. The dominant coping strategies for anxiety associated with clickers, cold calling, and group work were adaptive coping strategies of information seeking, self-reliance, and support-seeking, respectively. The dominant coping strategy for volunteering to answer a question was escape, which is a maladaptive strategy. This study provides a detailed exploration of student self-reported coping in response to active learning practices and suggests several areas that could be foci for future psychosocial interventions to bolster student regulation of their emotions in response to these new classroom practices."
https://openalex.org/W3048469593,"Angptl7 is a secreted and circulating cytokine that belongs to Angiopoietin-like family. The current knowledge about the function of Angptl7 is still limited, and its biological role is only marginally known, such as in the promotion of angiogenesis and inflammation. Here, we demonstrated that Angptl7 promotes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We found that the circulating Angptl7 levels in T2DM patient and mouse models were significantly elevated. Artificial overexpression of Angptl7 in hepatic cells inhibited glucose uptake and impaired insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, in vivo overexpression of Angptl7 in experimental healthy mice also caused insulin resistance-like characteristics. Mechanistic studies revealed that Angptl7 can upregulate SOCS3 expression, leading to the IRS1 degradation in proteasome. Furthermore, over-expressed Angptl7 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which was known to be associated with insulin resistance. Taken together, our study provided strong evidence that Angptl7 promotes insulin resistance and T2DM by multiple mechanisms, which made Angptl7 a new potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin resistance and T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3048591444,"Quantifying the association between lifetime exposures and the risk of developing a chronic disease is a recurrent challenge in epidemiology. Individual exposure trajectories are often heterogeneous and studying their associations with the risk of disease is not straightforward. We propose to use a latent class mixed model (LCMM) to identify profiles (latent classes) of exposure trajectories and estimate their association with the risk of disease. The methodology is applied to study the association between lifetime trajectories of smoking or occupational exposure to asbestos and the risk of lung cancer in males of the ICARE population-based case-control study. Asbestos exposure was assessed using a job exposure matrix. The classes of exposure trajectories were identified using two separate LCMM for smoking and asbestos, and the association between the identified classes and the risk of lung cancer was estimated in a second stage using weighted logistic regression and all subjects. A total of 2026/2610 cases/controls had complete information on both smoking and asbestos exposure, including 1938/1837 cases/controls ever smokers, and 1417/1520 cases/controls ever exposed to asbestos. The LCMM identified four latent classes of smoking trajectories which had different risks of lung cancer, all much stronger than never smokers. The most frequent class had moderate constant intensity over lifetime while the three others had either long-term, distant or recent high intensity. The latter had the strongest risk of lung cancer. We identified five classes of asbestos exposure trajectories which all had higher risk of lung cancer compared to men never occupationally exposed to asbestos, whatever the dose and the timing of exposure. The proposed approach opens new perspectives for the analyses of dose-time-response relationships between protracted exposures and the risk of developing a chronic disease, by providing a complete picture of exposure history in terms of intensity, duration, and timing of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3048476707,"Background It is known that bioenergetics of aerobic and resistance exercise are not the same but both can effectively improve depression. However, it is not clear whether and how different types of exercise can influence depression through the same metabolic regulatory system. Metabolomics provides a way to study the correlation between metabolites and changes in exercise and/or diseases through the quantitative analysis of all metabolites in the organism. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of aerobic and resistance training on urinary metabolites by metabolomics analysis in a rodent model of depression. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for eight weeks. The validity of the modeling was assessed by behavioral indices. After four weeks of CUMS, the rats that developed depression were randomly divided into a depression control group, an aerobic training group and a resistance training group. There was also a normal control group. From week 5, the rats in the exercise groups were trained for 30 min per day, five days per week, for four weeks. The urine samples were collected pre and post the training program, and analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy. Results Both types of training improved depression-like behavior in CUMS rats. Compared with normal control, 21 potential biomarkers were identified in the urine of CUMS rats, mainly involved in energy, amino acids and intestinal microbial metabolic pathways. Common responses to the training were found in the two exercise groups that the levels of glutamine, acetone and creatine were significantly recalled (all P<0.05) Aerobic training also resulted in changes in pyruvate and trigonelline, while resistance training modified α-Oxoglutarate, citric acid, and trimethylamine oxide (all P<0.05). Conclusions Aerobic and resistance training resulted in common effects on the metabolic pathways of alanine-aspartate-glutamate, TCA cycle, and butyric acid. Aerobic training also had effects on glycolysis or gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism, while resistance training had additional effect on intestinal microbial metabolism."

Regulation of apoptotic cell death is an important component in the coral stress response. Although cnidaria are known to contain complex apoptotic signaling pathways, similar to those in vertebrates, the mechanisms leading to cell death are largely unexplored. We identified and characterized two caspases each from Orbicella faveolata, a disease-sensitive reef-building coral, and Porites astreoides, a disease-resistant reef-building coral. The caspases are predicted homologs of the human executioner caspases-3 and -7, but OfCasp3a (Orbicella faveolata caspase-3a) and PaCasp7a (Porites astreoides caspase-7a), which we show to be DXXDases, contain an N-terminal caspase activation/recruitment domain (CARD) similar to human initiator/inflammatory caspases. OfCasp3b (Orbicella faveolata caspase-3b) and PaCasp3 (Porites astreoides caspase-3), which we show to be VXXDases, have short pro-domains, like human executioner caspases. Our biochemical analyses suggest a mechanism in coral which differs from that of humans, where the CARD-containing DXXDase is activated on death platforms but the protease does not directly activate the VXXDase. The first X-ray crystal structure of a coral caspase, of PaCasp7a determined at 1.57 Å resolution, reveals a conserved fold and an N-terminal peptide bound near the active site that may serve as a regulatory exosite. The binding pocket has been observed in initiator caspases of other species.

Basal metazoans, which appear to have a full complement of apoptotic signaling molecules, may therefore be more relevant to the evolutionary pathways of vertebrate apoptotic networks. Cnidarians including reef-building corals from the genus Scleractinia are ecologically important organisms that are on the decline (15Hughes T.P. Barnes M.L. Bellwood D.R. Cinner J.E. Cumming G.S.

The two primary drivers of coral declines are marine diseases affecting reef-building corals (17Maynard J. Van Hooidonk R. Eakin C.M. Puotinen M. Garren M. Williams G. Heron S.F. Lamb J. Weil E.

Coral possess an innate immune system that both defends the animals against pathogenic organisms and also serves as general stress responses (18Mansfield K.M. Gilmore T.D.

Therefore, the coral immune system is critical in the response of these organisms to both coral diseases and bleaching. Activation of the innate immune system activates apoptotic pathways (19Fuess L.E. Pinzón C J.H. Weil E. Grinshpon R.D. Mydlarz L.D. Life or death: Disease-tolerant coral species activate autophagy following immune challenge.Proc. R. Soc. Biol.

Traylor-Knowles N. Towards an integrated network of coral immune mechanisms.Proc. R. Soc. B Biol.

There are several examples pointing to the importance of apoptotic pathways and caspases in coral survival to both disease and temperature stress. An increase in expression of apoptosis-related genes was detected in a diseased Caribbean soft coral resulting in a visible inflammatory response (black-melanized appearance) (21Fuess L.E. Mann W.T.

Also, executioner caspase genes were up-regulated in the branching coral Acropora infected with white band disease (22Libro S. Kaluziak S.T. Vollmer S.V.

Specifically, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in Acropora millepora is up-regulated during temperature stress (26Pernice M. Dunn S.R. Miard T. Dufour S. Dove S. Hoegh-Guldberg O.

Interestingly, it was shown that application of caspase inhibitors can prevent the death of bleached coral (10Tchernov D. Kvitt H. Haramaty L. Bibby T.S. Gorbunov M.Y. Rosenfeld H. Falkowski P.G. Apoptosis and the selective survival of host animals following thermal bleaching in zooxanthellate corals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Collectively, the data show the potential for complex apoptotic signaling pathways in coral but data on activation and control mechanisms, and how they compare with those in vertebrates, are lacking because of a dearth of biochemical characterization. To gain insight into caspase activity and regulation in coral, we expressed and characterized two caspases each from two species of Caribbean reef-building corals, Orbicella faveolata and Porites astreoides. The two coral species are found on opposite ends of the stress-tolerance spectrum where the disease-susceptible O. faveolata activates caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways upon immune challenge, whereas the disease-tolerant P. astreoides activates an adaptive autophagic response (19Fuess L.E. Pinzón C J.H. Weil E. Grinshpon R.D. Mydlarz L.D. Life or death: Disease-tolerant coral species activate autophagy following immune challenge.Proc. R. Soc. Biol.

These findings indicate that understanding the apoptotic machinery in corals likely has significant implication in understanding species stress tolerance. In this investigation we describe the structural composition of each species' caspase repertoire, and we use these data to functionally characterize both initiator and effector caspases from both species. Two proteins referred to as PaCasp7a and OfCasp3a based on sequences similarity to human caspases contain CARD motifs at the N terminus, an unusual combination that has not been observed in caspases-3 or -7 enzymes from higher eukaryotes, and indeed these proteins function as initiator caspases. Additionally, two proteins PaCasp3 and OfCasp3b show canonical caspase-3/7 structural organization, with short pro-domains, and possess effector caspase function. We describe the first biochemical characterization of coral caspases and show that the PaCasp3 and OfCasp3b enzymes are not activated directly by the CARD-containing PaCasp7a and OfCasp3a, respectively. We also report the first X-ray crystal structure of a coral caspase, that of PaCasp7a determined at 1.57 Å resolution, which reveals an N-terminal peptide bound near the active site that may serve as a regulatory exosite. Overall, we find support for complex apoptotic mechanisms in these early metazoans, where the cellular machinery for both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis has ancient evolutionary origins. We examined seven caspase genes from O. faveolata based on sequences obtained from previous transcriptomic and genomic data (Fig. S1 and Table S1) (19Fuess L.E. Pinzón C J.H. Weil E. Grinshpon R.D. Mydlarz L.D. Life or death: Disease-tolerant coral species activate autophagy following immune challenge.Proc. R. Soc. Biol. Sci. 2017; 284 (28592676): 2017077110.1098/rspb.2017.0771Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The caspases were named based on the E-value from BLAST as well as the sequence similarity to the human orthologs. Results from examining the sequence homology and domain organization suggest that three of the caspases are apoptotic initiators and four are apoptotic effectors in O. faveolata (Fig. 1A). The sequence identities of the seven caspases compared with most human caspases are low, only ∼35% (Table 1), so it is difficult to determine the nature of each coral caspase based solely on sequence comparisons with human orthologs. In addition, two caspases from O. faveolata contain an N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) motif, similar to those in HsCasp2 and HsCasp9, and one caspase contains tandem death effector domain (DED) motifs, similar to that found in HsCasp8 (Fig. 1A). The remaining four proteins show domain organization similar to the human effector caspases, with short pro-domains (Fig. 1A).Table 1Protein sequence identity/similarity (%) with human caspasesHsCasp3HsCasp7HsCasp6HsCasp2HsCasp8HsCasp10HsCasp9OfCasp737/5438/5232/4928/4334/5033/5334/50OfCasp3c36/5835/5635/5232/4837/5337/5433/49OfCasp3b35/6032/5733/5232/4937/5533/5334/50OfCasp3a47/6945/6538/5429/4839/5439/5528/46OfCasp237/5341/5535/4633/5234/5235/5232/48OfCasp8a39/5639/5334/4835/5332/5830/4934/51OfCasp8b33/5631/5031/4932/5235/5134/5232/46PaCasp336/5837/5936/5633/4937/5434/5435/50PaCasp7a43/6544/6036/5328/4637/5337/5328/44PaCasp7b38/5437/5234/4929/4631/4830/5033/48PaCasp239/5338/5233/4833/5035/5335/5232/49 Open table in a new tab In the case of P. astreoides, four caspase sequences consisted of two initiator-like caspases (called PaCasp7a and PaCasp2) and two effector-like caspases (called PaCasp7b and PaCasp3) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Similar to the results for O. faveolata, the caspase sequences from P. astreoides also have only ∼35% identity with human caspases, regardless of comparisons to initiator or effector caspases (Table 1). The sequences from the two coral species displayed much higher identity to putative homologs in the other coral species. For example, PaCasp7a has a 77% sequence identity with OfCasp3a, whereas PaCasp3 has 71 and 73% sequence identity, respectively, with OfCasp3b and OfCasp3c. Likewise, PaCasp2 demonstrates 76% sequence identity with OfCasp2, and PaCasp7b shares 60% identity with OfCasp7 (Fig. 1B). A phylogenetic analysis of cnidarian and vertebrate caspases demonstrated that cnidarian caspases cluster in separate groups (Fig. 2A). All of the short pro-domain caspases, including PaCasp3 and OfCasp3b, cluster together between vertebrate effector (caspases-3/7) and initiator (caspases-8/10) caspases. Interestingly, the comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses suggest that short cnidarian caspases, that is, those lacking a CARD or DED, share a common ancestor with vertebrate effector caspases-3 and -7 and with initiator caspases-8 and -10 (Fig. 2A). Homologs of caspase-8 in coral share the same clade with vertebrate caspases-8 and -10 and the CARD-containing OfCasp2 and PaCasp2 clustered with vertebrate caspase-2. With the exceptions of OfCasp2 and PaCasp2, the other CARD-containing coral caspases cluster with OfCasp3a and PaCasp7a and segregate into a different clade, although they share a common ancestor with vertebrate caspases-2 and -9. We analyzed the CARD motifs of cnidarian caspases independently of the protease domains and compared them to the CARD motifs of vertebrate caspases-2 and -9 as well as that of caspase-2 and RIPK1 domain containing adaptor with death domain (CRADD) motifs, which recruit caspase-2 to the PIDDosome (27Park H.H. Structural features of caspase-activating complexes.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012; 13 (22606010): 4807-481810.3390/ijms13044807Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The CARD motifs of coral caspases-3 and -7 cluster together but are more closely related to the CARD of caspase-2 than those of caspase-9 or CRADD. Based on this analysis, there appear to be many CARD-containing caspase-3–like proteins in cnidaria. At present, it is not clear why CARD-containing caspase-3–like proteins provide an advantage for coral development and/or symbiosis because the animals also contain initiator caspases that presumably activate the short pro-domain effector caspases. CARD-containing caspase-3–like proteins are rarely observed in vertebrate effector caspases. Fish-specific caspases have been found, such as the CARD-containing caspase-8 for example (28Sakamaki K. Satou Y. Caspases: Evolutionary aspects of their functions in vertebrates.J. Fish Biol. 2009; 74 (20735596): 727-75310.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02184.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but caspase-2 is, at present, the only characterized DXXDase with a CARD. We chose two caspases from each species to characterize further, based on the sequence comparisons with human effector caspases-3, -6, or -7. In the case of O. faveolata, we chose two caspase-3–like proteins that showed 47 and 35% sequence identity, respectively, with HsCasp3, and we named the two proteins OfCasp3a and OfCasp3b, respectively (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Interestingly, despite predicted similarity to HsCasp3, OfCasp3a also has an N-terminal CARD motif. One caspase from P. astreoides demonstrated the highest sequence identity with HsCasp7 (44%) and was named PaCasp7a, even though it also contains a CARD motif (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The second protein from P. astreoides showed similar sequence identity to human caspases-3, -6, -7, and -8 (36–37%) (Fig. 1A and Table 1), but the protein does not have a DED motif like caspase-8 and the domain organization is more similar to that of caspase-3. Consequently, we named the protein PaCasp3. Overall, the low sequence identity between the vertebrate and invertebrate caspases show that the classification is somewhat arbitrary without further biochemical characterizations of the proteins. Together, the phylogenetic analysis shows that the caspases from P. astreoides and O. faveolata have relatively low sequence identity (∼40%) to mammalian caspases as well as other vertebrate families, but the proteins had much higher sequence identities to caspases from other cnidarian species, such as Pocillopora damicornis, Stylophora pistillata, and Nematostella vectensis. An analysis of the coral caspase sequences shows that the proteins contain all of the conserved features that define a caspase. For example, each protein contains the catalytic dyad, histidine (CP-075) and cysteine (CP-117) (Fig. 3), where “CP” refers to the common position defined previously for caspases (29Grinshpon R.D. Williford A. Titus-McQuillan J. Clay Clark A. The CaspBase: A curated database for evolutionary biochemical studies of caspase functional divergence and ancestral sequence inference.Protein Sci. 2018; 27 (30076665): 1857-187010.1002/pro.3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The conserved sequence that contains the catalytic histidine (CP-115)-QACRG-(CP-119) is found in the four coral caspases, although PaCasp7a and OfCasp3a contain QACQG as in human caspase-8. One of the most highly variable regions, the intersubunit linker (IL) is the same length in OfCasp3b and PaCasp3 compared with that of HsCasp3, whereas those of PaCasp7a and OfCasp3a have one and two amino acids fewer than HsCasp3, respectively (Fig. 3). We examined the four coral caspases by size exclusion chromatography because CARD-containing human caspases are monomers or mixtures of weak protomer-dimer (30Clark A.C. Caspase allostery and conformational selection.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116 (26750439): 6666-670610.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00540Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because the IL of the procaspase monomer is cleaved during activation, the protomer is defined as a single unit that contains a large and small subunit and a single active site. Thus, the dimer consists of two protomers, or is more formally considered a dimer of heterodimers. The data show that the CARD containing coral caspases, PaCasp7a and OfCasp3a, elute in a single peak with molecular mass of 42.6 and 44 kDa, respectively. The sizes are larger than that of a protomer but smaller than a dimer (Fig. S2 and Table S5), suggesting that the proteins form weak dimers similar to the human initiator caspases. In contrast, the short pro-domain containing caspases, PaCasp3 and OfCasp3b, are dimers similar to the human effector caspases, with molecular mass of 64.5 and 69.2 kDa, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S5). We also determined the mass of the large and small subunits by MS. Caspase zymogens are cleaved in the IL, and the N-terminal CARD or pro-domain is removed during activation (30Clark A.C. Caspase allostery and conformational selection.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116 (26750439): 6666-670610.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00540Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The proteins also autoprocess during overexpression in Escherichia coli. The molecular size of the large and small subunits of each caspase, determined by MS, are shown in Table S5. When compared with the sequences for each protein (Fig. 3), the data show that OfCasp3a and PaCasp7a are cleaved in the intersubunit linker after (CP-127)-DVTD-(CP-130), whereas OfCasp3b and PaCasp3 are cleaved after (CP-127)-VESD-(CP-130). The actual amino acid positions, in addition to the common position number, are shown in Fig. 1A, and the cleavage sites are indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3. In addition, the first 20 or 31 amino acids, respectively, in the pro-domains of OfCasp3b and PaCasp3 are removed following cleavage after VIGD (Asp20) (OfCasp3b) or SSTD (Asp31) (PaCasp3). The CARD motifs of OfCasp3a and of PaCasp7a are removed following cleavage after DEAD (Asp123) and DQAD (Asp119), respectively (Figs. 1A and 3). We note that there are potentially other cleavage sites in the CARD motifs, but in our assays the CARD motif was completely removed. We characterized the substrate specificity for each of the four coral caspases using substrate-phage display assays, as described previously (31Tucker M.B. MacKenzie S.H. Maciag J.J. Dirscherl Ackerman H. Swartz P. Yoder J.A. Hamilton P.T. Clay Clark A. Phage display and structural studies reveal plasticity in substrate specificity of caspase-3a from zebrafish.Protein Sci. 2016; 25 (27577093): 2076-208810.1002/pro.3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In these assays, we utilize two substrate-phage libraries that determine the P5-P1′ substrate preferences, with either aspartate fixed at the P1 position (P5-XXXXDX-P1′) or random (called 6×), and the results were the same for both libraries. The data show that PaCasp7a and OfCasp3a have Group II specificity, with a preference for aspartate in the P4 position (DXXDase) (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, PaCasp3 and OfCasp3b prefer valine in the P4 position (VXXDase) (Fig. 4, C and D), which is defined as Group III specificity like HsCasp6. The activities of PaCasp7a and of OfCasp3a were also examined using DEVD-AFC and VEID-AFC substrates. In all cases, however, the activity against the tetrapeptide substrates was very low because of Km values >500 μm, so we could not reliably determine the steady-state catalytic parameters kcat or Km from the small peptide activity assays. In caspases, the Km is thought to correlate with substrate binding (KD), so the high Km suggests poor binding of the small peptide. Because of the low activity in small peptide assays, we tested the coral caspases for their ability to hydrolyze full-length human procaspases-3 and -6, which were made catalytically inactive"
https://openalex.org/W3048959941,"Global climate change is driving the redistribution of marine species and thereby potentially restructuring endemic communities. Understanding how localised conservation measures such as protection from additional human pressures can confer resilience to ecosystems is therefore an important area of research. Here, we examine the resilience of a no-take marine reserve (NTR) to the establishment of urchin barrens habitat. The barrens habitat is created through overgrazing of kelp by an invading urchin species that is expanding its range within a hotspot of rapid climate change. In our study region, a multi-year monitoring program provides a unique time-series of benthic imagery collected by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) within an NTR and nearby reference areas. We use a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal modelling approach to estimate whether the NTR is associated with reduced formation of urchin barrens, and thereby enhances local resilience. Our approach controls for the important environmental covariates of depth and habitat complexity (quantified as rugosity derived from multibeam sonar mapping), as well as spatial and temporal dependence. We find evidence for the NTR conferring resilience with a strong reserve effect that suggests improved resistance to the establishment of barrens. However, we find a concerning and consistent trajectory of increasing barrens cover in both the reference areas and the NTR, with the odds of barrens increasing by approximately 32% per year. Thus, whereas the reserve is demonstrating resilience to the initial establishment of barrens, there is currently no evidence of recovery once barrens are established. We also find that depth and rugosity covariates derived from multibeam mapping provide useful predictors for barrens occurrence. These results have important management implications as they demonstrate: (i) the importance of monitoring programs to inform adaptive management; (ii) that NTRs provide a potential local conservation management tool under climate change impacts, and (iii) that technologies such as AUVs and multibeam mapping can be harnessed to inform regional decision-making. Continuation of the current monitoring program is required to assess whether the NTR can provide long term protection from a phase shift that replaces kelp with urchin barrens."

We create a mathematical model of a cold sensing neuron that has been formulated to understand the variety of ionic channels involved. In particular this model showcases the role of TRPM8 and voltage gated potassium channels in setting the temperature dependent activation and inactivation threshold level. Bifurcation analysis of the model demonstrates that a Hodgkin-Huxley type model with additional TRPM8 channels is sufficient to replicate observable experimental features of when different threshold level cold thermosensors turn on. Additionally, our analysis gives insight into what is happening at the temperature levels at which these neurons shut off and the role sodium and leak currents may have in this. This type of model construction and analysis provides a framework moving forward that will help tackle less well understood neuronal classes and their important ionic channels."

Although nitrogen limitation is the canonical inducer of autophagy, recent studies have revealed several other nutrients important to this process. In this study, we used a quantitative, high-throughput assay to identify potassium starvation as a new and potent inducer of autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that potassium-dependent autophagy requires the core pathway kinases Atg1, Atg5, and Vps34, and other components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex. Transmission EM revealed abundant autophagosome formation in response to both stimuli. RNA-Seq indicated distinct transcriptional responses: nitrogen affects transport of ions such as copper, whereas potassium targets the organization of other cellular components. Thus, nitrogen and potassium share the ability to influence molecular supply and demand but do so in different ways. Both inputs promote catabolism through bulk autophagy, but result in distinct mechanisms of cellular remodeling and synthesis.

To support these changes, cellular components are recycled into useable building blocks by two distinct and complementary mechanisms. Whereas the ubiquitin proteasome system breaks down specific short-lived proteins into their constituent amino acids, autophagy targets a wider variety of cytoplasmic cargo for degradation (5Dikic I. Proteasomal and autophagic degradation systems.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86 (28460188): 193-22410.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-044908Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of proteostasis comes from genetic studies conducted in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As first shown in yeast, and later in animals, autophagy can be induced by diverse nutritional and pharmacological signals that converge at the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) (6Takeshige K.

In nutrient-rich environments, TORC1 remains active and inhibits autophagy via phosphorylation. Under pro-autophagy conditions, deactivation of TORC1 promotes assembly of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins (such as Atg1) and lipid chains.

Activation of Vps34 leads to increased levels of PI 3-phosphate, which enables downstream proteins such as Atg5 to assemble into a functional complex and catalyze the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 (LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 in animal cells) to phosphatidylethanolamine (19Ichimura Y.

In addition to removing cytoplasmic proteins, autophagy helps to replenish the cellular pool of biologically important metals, which are required in large abundance (calcium, potassium, and sodium) or in trace amounts (iron, copper, and zinc) to maintain physiological parameters such as cell volume, pH, and protein synthesis (27Merchan S.

Under basal conditions, iron is recycled through the vacuolar transport and degradation of iron-containing cargo (30Mancias J.D. Pontano Vaites L. Nissim S. Biancur D.E. Kim A.J. Wang X. Liu Y.

Nitrogen limitation results in the release of calcium ions from lysosomes and the subsequent induction of autophagy through the activation of the transcription factor EB (31Medina D.L. Ballabio A. Lysosomal calcium regulates autophagy.Autophagy. 2015; 11 (26000950): 970-97110.1080/15548627.2015.1047130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Medina D.L. Di Paola S. Peluso I. Armani A.

In addition, the availability of certain ions influences basal and stress-induced autophagy. For example, zinc starvation promotes autophagic targeting of zinc-binding proteins in yeast (33Kawamata T. Horie T. Matsunami M. Sasaki M. Ohsumi Y. Zinc starvation induces autophagy in yeast.J.

Therefore, autophagy and ion homeostasis share a complex reciprocal relationship that is only beginning to be appreciated. Here we describe a new and important regulator of autophagy. Using a panel of independent and complementary methods, we show that short-term potassium starvation induces bulk autophagy. Using RNA-Seq, we demonstrate that nitrogen limitation and potassium starvation result in substantially different transcriptional profiles. Whereas nitrogen affects genes important to ion transport, potassium is less specific and regulates genes related to cellular organization. Taken together, our findings point to converging mechanisms for autophagic recycling of cellular materials in conjunction with distinct and complementary routes to transcriptional adaptation. Nitrogen limitation has long been the canonical inducer of autophagy. However, recent reports suggest that other salts, amino acids, and micronutrients are also important (33Kawamata T. Horie T. Matsunami M. Sasaki M. Ohsumi Y. Zinc starvation induces autophagy in yeast.J. Biol.

Autophagy may indeed be up-regulated to compensate for limited external availability of essential nutrients. We hypothesized that a quantitative and parallel analysis of growth medium components might reveal new pro-autophagy regulatory pathways. To enable high-throughput comparison of autophagy responses across diverse nutritional conditions, we used Rosella, a fluorescent reporter of autophagy (Fig. 1A) (37Rosado C.J. Mijaljica D. Hatzinisiriou I. Prescott M. Devenish R.J. Rosella: a fluorescent pH-biosensor for reporting vacuolar turnover of cytosol and organelles in yeast.Autophagy. 2008; 4 (18094608): 205-21310.4161/auto.5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 38Rangarajan N.

Rosella is composed of super-ecliptic pHluorin (green, pH-sensitive) fused with DsRed.T3 (red, pH stable). Upon induction of autophagy, the reporter is transported to the lumen of the vacuole where the acidic pH lowers green fluorescence, whereas red fluorescence remains unaffected. Rosella response is presented as a ratio of red and green fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1B, cells transferred to nitrogen limitation conditions exhibited a large increase in Rosella response as compared with control cells in standard medium. Next, we used Rosella to test other nutrients important for proper cellular growth and homeostasis. As described in Table 1, synthetic complete medium with 2% dextrose (SCD) is composed of a nitrogen source (ammonium sulfate), sugar (dextrose), amino acids, nucleotides, and a base mixture (yeast nitrogen base, or YNB) composed of vitamins, trace elements, and salts. YNB does not provide nitrogen, which is included separately as ammonium sulfate. Other investigators have shown that sugar starvation does not lead to completion of autophagy (39Lang M.J. Martinez-Marquez J.Y. Prosser D.C. Ganser L.R. Buelto D. Wendland B. Duncan M.C. Glucose starvation inhibits autophagy via vacuolar hydrolysis and induces plasma membrane internalization by down-regulating recycling.J. Biol.

Therefore, we turned our attention to other nutrients, and in particular, components of yeast nitrogen base. As shown in Fig. 1B, in the absence of YNB, cells displayed an increase in response that was similar in magnitude and substantially faster (t1/2 ∼ 1.25 h) than that observed in nitrogen limitation media (t1/2 ∼ 4 h). To identify the component(s) of YNB that individually contributed to the Rosella response (Fig. 1B) we supplemented SCD(-YNB) medium with each individual vitamin, trace element, or salt (Table 2 and Fig. 1C) and monitored fluorescence over time. As shown in Fig. 1D, Rosella response was significantly diminished upon addition of potassium phosphate (+KH2PO4) alone, whereas re-addition of other salts had no effect (Fig. 1D, inset). We note the comparatively small response to zinc sulfate. Depletion for Zn2+ ions was reported to induce autophagy, but over longer timescales of >16 h (33Kawamata T. Horie T. Matsunami M. Sasaki M. Ohsumi Y. Zinc starvation induces autophagy in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28264932): 8520-853010.1074/jbc.M116.762948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We conclude that, by this measure, potassium is the primary driver of autophagy observed in the absence of YNB.Table 1Components of synthetic complete medium with 2% dextrose (SCD)NutrientNameAmount (g/l, unless specified otherwise)SugarDextrose20NitrogenAmmonium sulfate5Nucleotides + Amino acidsCSM dropout mixture (CSM-Ura)0.69Uracil20 mgAdenine30 mgNaOH1 pelletVitamins, compounds supplying trace elements, and saltsYNB without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate1.7CSM, Complete Supplement Mixture.

To distinguish between the contributions of the constituent ions (K+ and H2PO4−), we measured autophagy in cells exposed to growth medium in which potassium phosphate (in the YNB) was replaced with ammonium phosphate SCD(-potassium). As shown in Fig. 1E, Rosella signal was elevated in these conditions, indicating that autophagy is specifically regulated by potassium cations. The response was recovered by the addition of 0.1–3 mm KCl, which has been used by others to replenish extracellular K+ ions (41Primo C. Ferri-Blázquez A. Loewith R. Yenush L. Reciprocal regulation of target of rapamycin complex 1 and potassium accumulation.J. Biol.

In complete SCD medium, K+ ions are present at a concentration of ∼7 mm. As shown in the time profiles in Fig. 1E, the response at 2 h was similar for both nitrogen and potassium but diverged substantially at later time points. The Rosella response at 2 h showed an EC50 of 1.2 mm KCl (Fig. 1F), which was substantially lower than that required to activate the Hog1 kinase (>50 mm), which is crucial for cellular adaptation to external osmotic changes (43Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C.

We observed substantial differences when comparing the response to SCD(-YNB) (Fig. 1B) with SCD(-potassium) (Fig. 1E). Although KH2PO4 appears to have a predominant role in mediating the autophagic response in SCD(-YNB), we infer that the lack of additional components in SCD(-YNB) contributes in some way, perhaps in a synergistic or cooperative fashion, to the kinetics and magnitude of the differences when comparing these conditions. The differences are not due to specific anions, given that autophagy is absent in SCD(-potassium) medium supplemented with KCl (Fig. 1E) or SCD(-YNB) medium supplemented with KH2PO4 (Fig. 1D, inset). Potassium ions are highly abundant within yeast cells (∼150–300 mm) and regulate ionic strength, turgor pressure, and enzyme function (28Page M.J. Di Cera E. Role of Na+ and K+ in enzyme function.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86 (17015484): 1049-109210.1152/physrev.00008.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 45Yenush L. Merchan S. Holmes J.

In accordance with these requirements and as shown previously, cell growth is slowed by the lack of extracellular potassium (47Lauff D.B. Santa-Maria G.E. Potassium deprivation is sufficient to induce a cell death program in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Yeast Res. 2010; 10 (20491936): 497-50710.1111/j.1567-1364.2010.00628.xPubMed Google Scholar). Addition of 0.3 mm KCl to SCD(-potassium) medium resulted in partial recovery of growth (Fig. 1G). At 1.0 and 3.0 mm KCl, long-term recovery of growth was near complete. The growth response at 20 h showed an EC50 of 0.9 mm KCl (Fig. 1H). To ensure that cells remained viable, we monitored propidium iodide fluorescence (48Deere D. Shen J. Vesey G. Bell P. Bissinger P. Veal D. Flow cytometry and cell sorting for yeast viability assessment and cell selection.Yeast. 1998; 14 (10.1002/(SICI)1097-0061(19980130)14:2<147::AID-YEA207>3.0.CO;2-L): 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) from individual cells in microplate wells exposed to the same growth media as in Fig. 1G. As shown in Fig. 1I, propidium iodide fluorescence remained low under potassium starvation conditions and was elevated upon nitrogen limitation. Thus, potassium is required for proper cell growth and autophagy. The autophagy response to potassium starvation is ∼30% of that seen in response to nitrogen limitation. In contrast to nitrogen, however, potassium is not required to maintain cell viability, at least in the short term. Our findings presented in Fig. 1 indicate that the potassium-dependent autophagy response is lower than that for nitrogen. The magnitude of autophagy is regulated by many factors that control the number or size of autophagosomes (49Du Toit A. Hofmeyr J.S. Gniadek T.J. Loos B. Measuring autophagosome flux.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29909716): 1060-107110.1080/15548627.2018.1469590PubMed Google Scholar, 50Backues S.K. Chen D. Ruan J. Xie Z. Klionsky D.J.

To further compare potassium starvation and nitrogen limitation, we examined the accumulation of autophagosomes in individual cells using transmission EM (TEM). For these experiments, we used cells lacking the vacuolar protease Pep4, which is required for breakdown of autophagosomes within the vacuole (6Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119 (1400575): 301-31110.1083/jcb.119.2.301Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). We first grew the cells for 6 h in SCD(-nitrogen) or SCD(-potassium) medium, harvested the cells by centrifugation, and prepared the cells for TEM imaging (fixed, dehydrated, embedded, cut, and stained). As expected, nitrogen limitation resulted in the formation of multiple autophagosomes in ∼95% of the cells. On average, we observed 6.9 ± 0.9 autophagosomes/cell with a cross-sectional area of 0.102 ± 0.042 μm2 (Fig. 2, A and B). In potassium-starved samples, autophagosomes were evident in only ∼10% of the cells, far fewer than that observed in nitrogen-limited cells. However, when present, the number (6.5 ± 1 per cell) and size (0.089 ± 0.037 μm2) of autophagosomes were similar under both conditions. The presence of autophagosomes is a hallmark of macroautophagy, as opposed to other types of autophagy, in particular microautophagy. In both conditions, we observed accumulation of glycogen granules (G) and lipid droplets (L) in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A and C). These features are characteristic of bulk autophagy (6Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119 (1400575): 301-31110.1083/jcb.119.2.301Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Although most of the autophagosomes observed in our TEM images were already engulfed by the vacuole, we also observed some that were fused to the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 2C) prior to engulfment. From these results, we conclude that potassium starvation leads to autophagosome formation but does so in only a subset of cells. Whereas Rosella reports on the transport of cytoplasmic cargo to the vacuole, other methods directly monitor components of the autophagy machinery such as autophagosomes and vacuolar proteins. To confirm the pro-autophagy effect of potassium starvation, we monitored the spatial localization of the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8. Upon induction of autophagy, Atg8 conjugates with phosphatidylethanolamine to form autophagosomes, which deliver cytoplasmic contents to the vacuole (19Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y.

During this process, Atg8 assembles into autophagosomal clusters, which are observed as bright puncta within the cell (52Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H.

As shown in Fig. 2D, we observed a substantial increase in GFP-Atg8 clusters under potassium starvation. This response was greater than that for nitrogen-limited cells, as is evident from the frequency distribution plots. These results indicate that autophagy is initiated in a majority of the cells but that the process is completed in only a subset of those cells.

These factors, combined with risks of antibiotic resistance, have led to interest in bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as natural food preservatives and as potential protein therapeutics. We previously reported the discovery of plantacyclin B21AG, a circular bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum B21. Here, we describe the cloning and functional expression of the bacteriocin gene cluster in the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. Genome sequencing demonstrated that the bacteriocin is encoded on a 20 kb native plasmid, designated as pB21AG01. Seven open reading frames (ORFs) putatively involved in bacteriocin production, secretion and immunity were cloned into an E. coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vector, pTRKH2. The resulting plasmid, pCycB21, was transformed into L. plantarum WCFS1. The cell free supernatants (CFS) of both B21 and WCFS1 (pCycB21) showed an antimicrobial activity of 800 AU/mL when tested against WCFS1 (pTRKH2) as the indicator strain, showing that functional expression of plantacyclin B21AG had been achieved. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the relative copy number of pB21AG01 was 7.60 ± 0.79 in L. plantarum B21 whilst pCycB21 and pTRKH2 was 0.51 ± 0.05 and 25.19 ± 2.68 copies respectively in WCFS1. This indicates that the bacteriocin gene cluster is located on a highly stable low copy number plasmid pB21AG01 in L. plantarum B21. Inclusion of the native promoter for the bacteriocin operon from pB21AG01 results in similar killing activity being observed in both the wild type and recombinant hosts despite the lower copy number of pCycB21."

We aimed to broadly characterize the ARD at Ely Brook, which drains the Ely Copper Mine Superfund site in Vermont, USA, using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to assess the metabolic potential and seasonal ecological roles of microorganisms in water and sediment. Using Centrifuge against the NCBI “nt” database, ~25% of reads in sediment and water samples were classified as acid-tolerant Proteobacteria (61 ± 4%) belonging to the genera Pseudomonas (2.6–3.3%), Bradyrhizobium (1.7–4.1%), and Streptomyces (2.9–5.0%). Numerous genes (12%) were differentially expressed between seasons and played significant roles in iron, sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. The most abundant RNA transcript encoded the multidrug resistance protein Stp, and most expressed KEGG-annotated transcripts were involved in amino acid metabolism. Biosynthetic gene clusters involved in secondary metabolism (BGCs, 449) as well as metal- (133) and antibiotic-resistance (8501) genes were identified across the entire dataset. Several antibiotic and metal resistance genes were colocalized and coexpressed with putative BGCs, providing insight into the protective roles of the molecules BGCs produce. Our study shows that ecological stimuli, such as metal concentrations and seasonal variations, can drive ARD taxa to produce novel bioactive metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W3048622106,"Actin's interactions with myosin and other actin-binding proteins are essential for cellular viability in numerous cell types, including muscle. In a previous high-throughput time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET) screen, we identified a class of compounds that bind to actin and affect actomyosin structure and function. For clinical utility, it is highly desirable to identify compounds that affect skeletal and cardiac muscle differently. Because actin is more highly conserved than myosin and most other muscle proteins, most such efforts have not targeted actin. Nevertheless, in the current study, we tested the specificity of the previously discovered actin-binding compounds for effects on skeletal and cardiac α-actins as well as on skeletal and cardiac myofibrils. We found that a majority of these compounds affected the transition of monomeric G-actin to filamentous F-actin, and that several of these effects were different for skeletal and cardiac actin isoforms. We also found that several of these compounds affected ATPase activity differently in skeletal and cardiac myofibrils. We conclude that these structural and biochemical assays can be used to identify actin-binding compounds that differentially affect skeletal and cardiac muscles. The results of this study set the stage for screening of large chemical libraries for discovery of novel compounds that act therapeutically and specifically on cardiac or skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3048636178,"The induction of general plant defense responses following the perception of external elicitors is now regarded as the first level of the plant immune response. Depending on the involvement or not of these molecules in pathogenicity, this induction of defense is called either Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) Triggered Immunity or Pattern Triggered Immunity-both abbreviated to PTI. Because PTI is assumed to be a widespread and stable form of resistance to infection, understanding the mechanisms driving it becomes a major goal for the sustainable management of plant-pathogen interactions. However, the induction of PTI is complex. Our hypotheses are that (i) the recognition by the plant of PAMPs vs non-PAMP elicitors leads to specific defense profiles and (ii) the responses specifically induced by PAMPs target critical life history traits of the pathogen that produced them. We thus analyzed, using a metabolomic approach coupled with transcriptomic and hormonal analyses, the defense profiles induced in potato foliage treated with either a Concentrated Culture Filtrate (CCF) from Phytophthora infestans or two non-PAMP preparations, β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) and an Ulva spp. Extract, used separately. Each elicitor induced specific defense profiles. CCF up-regulated sesquiterpenes but down-regulated sterols and phenols, notably α-chaconine, caffeoyl quinic acid and rutin, which decreased spore production of P. infestans in vitro. CCF thus induces both defense and counter-defense responses. By contrast, the Ulva extract triggered the synthesis of a large-spectrum of antimicrobial compounds through the phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathways, while BABA targeted the primary metabolism. Hence, PTI can be regarded as a heterogeneous set of general and pathogen-specific responses triggered by the molecular signatures of each elicitor, rather than as a uniform, non-specific and broad-spectrum set of general defense reactions."

Additionally, by using area under the curve (AUC) analysis of the parameters of interest during the graded test, we studied the effects of music at two physiological moments-before and after anaerobic threshold (iAT)-in men and women. Twenty (men = 10; women = 10) healthy and active participants completed four visits to the laboratory. The first and second sessions were used for sample characterization. In the third and fourth sessions, participants performed an incremental running test (started at 7 km.h-1 with increments of 1 km.h-1 at each 3-minute stage) under preferred music and non-music conditions. Blood ([Lac]), heart rate (HR), and perceived exertion were measured by two scales (RPEBorg and the estimation of time limit ‒ ETL) during all tests, and the total time of effort (TT) was considered as performance. Individual curves of the intensity vs blood lactate analyzed by the bissegmentation method provide the iAT and the AUC of [Lac], HR, RPEBorg, and ETL before and after the iAT attainment were calculated. The iAT for men (non-music: 11.5±0.9km.h-1 vs music: 11.6±1.1km.h-1) and women (non-music: 9.8±0.7km.h-1 vs music: 9.7±0.7km.h-1) was not affected by music, and for both sexes, there was no difference between non-music and music conditions in all variables obtained at iAT. The AUC of all variables were not affected by music before the iAT attainment. However, [Lac], HR, and RPEBorg presented higher values of AUC after iAT for the female group with preferred music. This may be due to the fact that 70% of women have increased TT under music conditions. Overall, preferred music did not affect the iAT determination in an incremental running test. However, some physiological responses and perceived exertion after iAT of female subjects seems to be influenced by preferred music."
https://openalex.org/W3048603482,"Many sleep and circadian studies require participants to adhere to structured sleep-wake schedules designed to stabilize sleep outcomes and circadian phase prior to in-laboratory testing. The effectiveness of this approach has not been rigorously evaluated, however. We therefore investigated the differences between participants' unstructured and structured sleep over a three-week interval.Twenty-three healthy young adults completed three weeks of sleep monitoring, including one week of unstructured sleep and two weeks of structured sleep with consistent bed and wake times. Circadian phase was assessed via salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) during both the unstructured and structured sleep episodes.Compared to their unstructured sleep schedule, participants' bed- and wake times were significantly earlier in their structured sleep, by 34 ± 44 mins (M ± SD) and 44 ± 41 mins, respectively. During structured sleep, circadian phase was earlier in 65% of participants (40 ± 32 mins) and was later in 35% (41 ± 25 mins) compared to unstructured sleep but did not change at the group level. While structured sleep reduced night-to-night variability in sleep timing and sleep duration, and improved the alignment (phase angle) between sleep onset and circadian phase in the most poorly aligned individuals (DLMO < 1h or > 3h before sleep onset time; 25% of our sample), sleep duration and quality were unchanged.Our results show adherence to a structured sleep schedule results in more regular sleep timing, and improved alignment between sleep and circadian timing for those individuals who previously had poorer alignment. Our findings support the use of structured sleep schedules prior to in-laboratory sleep and circadian studies to stabilize sleep and circadian timing in healthy volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W3048648085,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) that cause severe disease predominantly carry the toxin gene variant stx2a. However, the role of Shiga toxin in the ruminant reservoirs of this zoonotic pathogen is poorly understood and strains that cause severe disease in humans (HUSEC) likely constitute a small and atypical subset of the overall STEC flora. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of stx2a in samples from cattle and to isolate and characterize stx2a-positive E. coli. In nationwide surveys in Sweden and Norway samples were collected from individual cattle or from cattle herds, respectively. Samples were tested for Shiga toxin genes by real-time PCR and amplicon sequencing and stx2a-positive isolates were whole genome sequenced. Among faecal samples from Sweden, stx1 was detected in 37%, stx2 in 53% and stx2a in 5% and in skin (ear) samples in 64%, 79% and 2% respectively. In Norway, 79% of the herds were positive for stx1, 93% for stx2 and 17% for stx2a. Based on amplicon sequencing the most common stx2 types in samples from Swedish cattle were stx2a and stx2d. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 39 stx2a-positive isolates collected from both countries revealed substantial diversity with 19 different sequence types. Only a few classical LEE-positive strains similar to HUSEC were found among the stx2a-positive isolates, notably a single O121:H19 and an O26:H11. Lineages known to include LEE-negative HUSEC were also recovered including, such as O113:H21 (sequence type ST-223), O130:H11 (ST-297), and O101:H33 (ST-330). We conclude that E. coli encoding stx2a in cattle are ranging from strains similar to HUSEC to unknown STEC variants. Comparison of isolates from human HUS cases to related STEC from the ruminant reservoirs can help identify combinations of virulence attributes necessary to cause HUS, as well as provide a better understanding of the routes of infection for rare and emerging pathogenic STEC."
https://openalex.org/W3048657183,"Blood was collected from wild captured green and Kemp's ridley turtles off the west coast of Florida, USA. Blood gases and biochemical values were analyzed using a point of care (POC) device in the field. Analytes include pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess (BE), oxygen saturation (sO2), lactate, sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), anion gap, ionized calcium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Crea), hematocrit (Hct), and hemoglobin (Hb). These are novel data for wild healthy Kemp's ridley turtles, and results for green turtles were generally consistent with past studies of green turtles with exceptions primarily in blood gas values. Ninety percent of the green turtles had fibropapillomatosis (FP), but none of the blood analytes were correlated with disease severity. Only BUN was correlated with weight of green turtles, and there was no correlation between blood parameters and weight of Kemp's ridley turtles. This study provides data that are useful in understanding the physiologic status of sea turtles specific to this region, allowing for comparisons to other populations, life stages, and disease states."
https://openalex.org/W3048673677,"Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome are life-threatening diseases. Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine, the mortality is still as high as 50%, which stems from our insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the diseases. The roles of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have been extensively investigated in LPS- and IgG immune complexes-stimulated acute lung injury. However, the effect of C/EBPγ, belonging to the same family as C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, on ALI has not been elucidated. Our previous data have shown that during LPS-/IgG immune complexes-induced ALI, the DNA binding activities of C/EBPγ are obviously reduced. In the present study, we determine whether ALI induced by LPS and IgG immune complexes is affected by C/EBPγ. We find that adenovirus-mediated C/EBPγ expression in the lung tissue alleviates LPS-/IgG immune complexes-stimulated acute pulmonary damage through reducing vascular permeability changes and recruitment of neutrophils into alveolar spaces, which might be linked to a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, our data obtained from macrophages in vitro are consistent with the in vivo results. In terms of mechanisms, C/EBPγ might inhibit LPS-/IgG immune complexes-mediated inflammation via alleviating C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ transcription activities as reflected by luciferase assays. However, the NF-κB-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators is not affected by C/EBPγ. Taken together, C/EBPγ suppresses LPS- and IgG immune complexes-induced pro-inflammatory mediators' production through the downregulation of C/EBP but not NF-κB activation, leading to the subsequent attenuation of ALI. Collectively, our data provide an insight into the critical role of C/EBPγ in acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W3048707128,"Vaccine hesitancy-the reluctance to receive recommended vaccination because of concerns and doubts about vaccines-is recognized as a significant threat to the success of vaccination programs and has been associated with recent major outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, the association between complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and vaccine hesitancy and/or refusal has been frequently reported in the literature. To date, significant gaps persist in our understanding of contemporary Canadian CAM providers' beliefs regarding vaccination and how socio-professional influences may shape their vaccine-related attitudes and behaviours. To address the latter gap, the current study aims to explore the content of professional guidelines, recommendations and other discourses among CAM providers as they concern vaccination by analyzing both academic, peer-reviewed literature and Canadian organizational webpages prepared by and/or for practicing chiropractors, naturopaths and homeopaths. In the academic literature, we identified a number of complex and diverging views on vaccination that spanned topics of effectiveness; safety; theoretical, empirical, and ethical soundness; political justifiability; and compatibility with CAM philosophy and professional boundaries. However, in its current state the CAM literature cannot be described in broad strokes as being either pro- or anti-vaccination without considering finer areas of disagreement. Compared to the academic literature, which focuses more on the conceptual and evidentiary basis of vaccination, a greater proportion of vaccine-related content on Canadian CAM organizations' webpages seems to be dedicated to offering specific directives and prescriptions to providers. Guidelines and standards of practice address a number of issues, including vaccine administration, counsel, education and marketing. As CAM organizations further evolve in Canada and elsewhere as part of a broader ""professionalization"" initiative, greater attention will need to be directed at their role in shaping providers' beliefs and practices that both support and undermine vaccine promotion efforts."

The shock-and-kill pharmacological ap-proach aims to reactivate provirus expression in the presence of antiretroviral therapy and target virus-expressing cells for elimination. However, no latency reversal agent (LRA) to date effectively clears viral reservoirs in humans, suggesting a need for new LRAs and LRA combinations. Here, we screened 216 compounds from the pan-African Natural Product Library and identified knipholone anthrone (KA) and its basic building block anthralin (dithranol) as novel LRAs that reverse viral latency at low micromolar concentrations in multiple cell lines. Neither agent's activity depends on protein kinase C; nor do they inhibit class I/II histone deacetylases. However, they are differentially modulated by oxidative stress and metal ions and induce distinct patterns of global gene expression from established LRAs. When applied in combination, both KA and anthralin synergize with LRAs representing multiple functional classes. Finally, KA induces both HIV RNA and protein in primary cells from HIV-infected donors. Taken together, we describe two novel LRAs that enhance the activities of multiple shock-and-kill agents, which in turn may inform ongoing LRA combination therapy efforts."

The dynamic impact mechanical characteristics of structural anisotropic coal under low and medium strain rates were studied by using self-made vertical Split Hopkinson Bar (SHPB) equipment. The peak stress, the strain rate, dynamic elastic modulus and failure characteristics of raw coal with three coring directions were analyzed under the influence of five impact loads and structural anisotropy. The peak stress increases linearly with impact load, and the maximum strain rate and the dynamic elastic modulus increase exponentially with impact load. The coal samples display anisotropic mechanical characteristics. The values of maximum strain rate, peak stress and dynamic elastic modulus are ranked with directions by the perpendicular to bedding direction (Z direction), the parallel to bedding direction (X direction), and the oblique 45° to bedding direction (Y direction). Dynamic mechanical properties of structural anisotropic coal provide a theoretical basis for gas seepage in far-blasting field."
https://openalex.org/W3048472708,"High-quality three-dimensional structural data is of great value for the functional interpretation of biomacromolecules, especially proteins; however, structural quality varies greatly across the entries in the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). Since 2008, the wwPDB has required the inclusion of structure factors with the deposition of x-ray crystallographic structures to support the independent evaluation of structures with respect to the underlying experimental data used to derive those structures. However, interpreting the discrepancies between the structural model and its underlying electron density data is difficult, since derived sigma-scaled electron density maps use arbitrary electron density units which are inconsistent between maps from different wwPDB entries. Therefore, we have developed a method that converts electron density values from sigma-scaled electron density maps into units of electrons. With this conversion, we have developed new methods that can evaluate specific regions of an x-ray crystallographic structure with respect to a physicochemical interpretation of its corresponding electron density map. We have systematically compared all deposited x-ray crystallographic protein models in the wwPDB with their underlying electron density maps, if available, and characterized the electron density in terms of expected numbers of electrons based on the structural model. The methods generated coherent evaluation metrics throughout all PDB entries with associated electron density data, which are consistent with visualization software that would normally be used for manual quality assessment. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to derive units of electrons directly from electron density maps without the aid of the underlying structure factors. These new metrics are biochemically-informative and can be extremely useful for filtering out low-quality structural regions from inclusion into systematic analyses that span large numbers of PDB entries. Furthermore, these new metrics will improve the ability of non-crystallographers to evaluate regions of interest within PDB entries, since only the PDB structure and the associated electron density maps are needed. These new methods are available as a well-documented Python package on GitHub and the Python Package Index under a modified Clear BSD open source license."

Here, extending studies on the role of the H2 α-helix C terminus of PrP, we found that deletion of the highly conserved 190HTVTTTT196 segment of ovine PrP led to spontaneous prion formation in the RK13 rabbit kidney cell model. On long-term passage, the mutant cells stably produced proteinase K (PK)–resistant, insoluble, and aggregated assemblies that were infectious for naïve cells expressing either the mutant protein or other PrPs with slightly different deletions in the same area. The electrophoretic pattern of the PK-resistant core of the spontaneous prion (ΔSpont) contained mainly C-terminal polypeptides akin to C1, the cell-surface anchored C-terminal moiety of PrP generated by natural cellular processing. RK13 cells expressing solely the Δ190–196 C1 PrP construct, in the absence of the full-length protein, were susceptible to ΔSpont prions.

Prions can emerge spontaneously as in sporadic cases of human Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), that is, without evidence of infection or contamination. In this context, prion generation requires at first the formation of nuclei stable enough to initiate the polymerization process, which is expected to be a slow and rate-limiting step (15Cobb N.J.

Indeed, spontaneous prion disease is a rare event, the prevalence of sporadic CJD being of ∼1.5 cases per million per year worldwide. Mutations in PrP can favor PrP spontaneous conversion into prions. Indeed, more than 30 mutations responsible for inherited human prion diseases, including genetic CJD, Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome (GSS), or fatal familial insomnia, were identified, and these dominant allelic mutations usually show a high penetrance (16Mead S. Lloyd S. Collinge J. Genetic factors in mammalian prion diseases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2019; 53 (31537104): 117-14710.1146/annurev-genet-120213-092352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Disease-causing mutations might favor partial unfolding or transient denaturation of PrPC, which are required for refolding into PrPSc, and might also increase stability of initial PrPSc seeds. The cellular and molecular processes underpinning or preventing spontaneous prion generation remain poorly understood. Transgenic mouse models of spontaneous prion formation have proven difficult to obtain. This was achieved for human or mouse PrP bearing some mutations (17Jackson W.S. Borkowski A.W. Watson N.E.

We now show that specific deletion of the larger H2 C-terminal segment HTVTTTT, which removes three additional residues, causes the spontaneous conversion of the mutant ovine PrP into a new type of prion. This prion exhibits a main protease-resistant core shorter than usual, of C1 size, which was able to infect naïve RK13 cells expressing the mutant C1 segment alone. The potential importance of H2 C terminus for maintenance of normal PrPC conformation in the cell, the specificities of the new mutant prion, and the surprising conversion of the homologous mutant C1 fragment into a prion entity are discussed. We focused here on Δ190–196 ovine PrP (VRQ allelic variant), a mutant PrP with a specific deletion of seven amino acids at the end of helix H2 (Fig. 1). We previously reported that a larger deletion of the H2 C terminus (Δ190–197) did not have a major impact on the structure of the protein, leaving intact the spatial organization of the three α-helices in the globular domain of PrP (23Munoz-Montesino C.

As with Δ190–197 PrP, structural analysis of recombinant Δ190–196 PrP by CD indicated a conservation of the overall α-helical content compared with WT PrP (Fig. 2A). This is in agreement with NMR analysis of the segment 113–214 of Δ190–196 PrP (C1113), which contains the entire sequence of the structured domain and is an equivalent to the natural C1 fragment studied hereinafter. The large dispersion of amide chemical shifts observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N13C-labeled mutant C1113 indicated that it maintained a globular core, in addition to its unstructured N-terminal region (Fig. 2B). Moreover, comparison with the spectra of Δ193–196 and Δ190–197 mutant PrPs previously obtained (23Munoz-Montesino C. Sizun C. Moudjou M. Herzog L. Reine F. Chapuis J. Ciric D. Igel-Egalon A. Laude H.

However, the deletion of the other residues might also impact the thermodynamic stability of the protein. We thus tested whether the deletion affected the stability using a thermal shift assay to determine the melting temperature of WT and mutant PrP. The melting temperature of Δ190–196 PrP (49.9 °C) was reduced by 7 °C compared with the WT PrP in sodium acetate buffer (10 mm, pH 5.0) (Fig. 2D). A marked reduction of 8 °C was also observed in these assays, using a different condition, sodium phosphate buffer (250 mm, pH 5.1), that increases the thermal stability of both WT and Δ190–196 recombinant PrPs (Fig. S2). Altogether these observations indicate that Δ190–196 mutant PrP conserves the overall structure of WT PrP but loses some stability. Ovine Δ190–196 PrP was stably transfected in RK13 cells to generate sublines and clones referred to as Δ190–196 Rov. Mutant PrP was efficiently expressed as a glycoprotein in Rov cells. Western blotting showed that unglycosylated forms of Δ190–196 PrPC were underrepresented compared with WT or Δ193–197 PrPs generated previously (23Munoz-Montesino C. Sizun C. Moudjou M. Herzog L.

Deglycosylation by PNGase F treatment corroborated the high glycosylation level of Δ190–196 PrP and indicated that the mutant protein was smaller than WT PrPC by ∼1 kDa, as expected (Fig. 3B). Using an antibody with an epitope in the C-terminal part of PrP rather than in the N-terminal region allowed us to identify both the full-length protein and its natural C-terminal C1 fragment. PNGase treatment was required for accurate identification of PrPC and C1, because they are both highly glycosylated. The relative proportion of the full-length PrP versus the C1 fragment was roughly similar for the WT and the mutant protein (Fig. 3C). Immunofluorescence showed co-localization of Δ190–196 PrP with WGA, a lectin marker of plasma membrane glycoconjugates, indicating that the mutant protein was correctly addressed to the Δ190–196 Rov cell surface (Fig. 3D) as with the WT protein (27Vilette D.

These observations indicate that Δ190–196 PrP has correct post-translational modifications and cell trafficking. The expression of Δ190–196 PrP was turned on by addition of doxycycline, and we followed the fate of the protein over cell passaging by Western blotting, checking for the appearance of PK-resistant forms. Although Δ190–196 PrP was sensitive to PK digestion during the first passages, a PK-resistant form systematically appeared, usually after the fourth or fifth passage (Fig. 4A). This protease-resistant form termed Δ190–196 PrPres persisted for >1 year of continuous culture (Fig. 5A). The electrophoretic profile of Δ190–196 PrPres was characterized by a large smear of glycosylated species and the presence of a well-individualized faint band migrating at 14 kDa (Fig. 4A). A second weaker band migrating at 15.5–16 kDa was detected upon overexposure of the blots or when enough material was loaded on the gel (Fig. 5A). Treatment with PNGase F allowed resolving the whole emerging PK-resistant species in two major bands: a main 14-kDa species that had the same size than the C1 fragment and a larger less represented peptide above the 15-kDa molecular mass marker that will be further referred to as 16-kDa PrPres (Fig. 4B). This indicated that the 14- and 16-kDa bands identified without PNGase treatment (Figs. 4A and 5A) were nonglycosylated native forms of Δ190–196 PrPres.Figure 5Persistence of the PK-resistant form in cultures, insolubility of PrPres, and reproducibility of spontaneous conversion. Immunoblots of PK-treated samples are shown. A, Δ190–196 PrPSc was produced persistently up to 1 year of continuous cell culture passage (1 per week). PrPres at 20, 30, and 52 weeks of culture are shown: 10 µg of total protein in 10 µl of cell lysate were digested and loaded (lanes 2–4). In lane 1 (P20+), the equivalent of 100 µg of protein from the passage at 20 weeks was loaded after PK digestion and concentration of insoluble material at 22,000 × g, to improve detection of the 14- and 16-kDa unglycosylated bands (Sha31 mAb).

C, individual clones isolated from two independent transfections. Five clones (lanes 1–5) with roughly similar Δ190–196 PrP expression levels (upper panel, 4F2 mAb) are shown.

Individual Δ190–196 Rov clones obtained by limiting dilution spontaneously produced Δ190–196 PrPres, except for one clone, clone 12, despite expression of the mutant PrP to levels similar to those of other clones (Fig. 5C). This “resistant” clone was useful for the infection studies described in the following section, and its existence suggested that currently unrecognized cellular factors are key for the spontaneous generation of Δ190–196 PrPres. Δ190–196 Rov cells could be frozen and thawed, without affecting the generation of PK-resistant PrP species. This characteristic together with persistence in cell culture recalled that of prion-infected cells. We next examined whether the biochemical properties of Δ190–196 PrPSc resembled those of prions passaged in WT Rov cells. Δ190–196 Rov lysates were treated with increasing PK concentrations and analyzed by Western blotting. Δ190–196 PrPSc resisted to higher concentration of PK (Fig. 6, A and B) than 127S prions propagated in WT Rov (Fig. 6C). Δ190–196 PrPres was recovered by centrifugation at 20,000 × g after PK digestion, indicating that it was insoluble and aggregated (Fig. 5A). The aggregation size of Δ190–196 PrPSc was determined by sedimentation velocity. Δ190–196 PrPSc formed assemblies with a size in the range of PrPSc assemblies formed by subfibrillar prions (Fig. 6D) according to previous reports (29Tixador P. Herzog L. Reine F. Jaumain E.

Whether the difference is due to the number of PrP-mers composing the assemblies or to the density of their main core remains to be determined. To summarize, introduction of the 190–196 deletion in RK13 cells favored the spontaneous and persistent production of PK-resistant PrPSc species with an atypical electrophoretic pattern. Δ190–196 PrP spontaneously adopted a conformation that showed hallmarks of a prion: insolubility, aggregation, protease resistance and cell perpetuation. We thus called this e"

The molecular mechanism has been subject to surprisingly few studies. Analysis of gene expression level has become an important means to study gene function and its regulation mechanism. But identification of reference genes (RGs) stability under cold stress have not been reported in famous medicinal mushroom-forming fungi Cordyceps militaris. Herein, 12 candidate RGs had been systematically validated under cold stress in C. militaris. Three different algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper were applied to evaluate the expression stability of the RGs. Our results showed that UBC and UBQ were the most stable RGs for cold treatments in short and long periods, respectively. 2 RGs (UBC and PP2A) and 3 RGs (UBQ, TUB and CYP) were the suitable RGs for cold treatments in short and long periods, respectively. Moreover, target genes, two-component-system histidine kinase genes, were selected to validate the most and least stable RGs under cold treatment, which indicated that use of unstable expressed genes as RGs leads to biased results. Our results provide a good starting point for accurate reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction normalization by using UBC and UBQ in C. militaris under cold stress and better support for understanding the mechanism of response to cold stress and fruiting body formation in C. militaris and other mushroom-forming fungi in future research."

Still, the functional substrates of the brain associated with behavioral traits of eating disorder are underexplored. Existing neuroimaging studies have explored the association between eating disorder and brain function without using all the information provided by the eating disorder related questionnaire but by adopting summary factors. Here, we aimed to investigate the multivariate association between brain function and eating disorder at fine-grained question-level information. Our study is a retrospective secondary analysis that re-analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of 284 participants from the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample database. Leveraging sparse canonical correlation analysis, we associated the functional connectivity of all brain regions and all questions in the eating disorder questionnaires. We found that executive- and inhibitory control-related frontoparietal networks showed positive associations with questions of restraint eating, while brain regions involved in the reward system showed negative associations. Notably, inhibitory control-related brain regions showed a positive association with the degree of obesity. Findings were well replicated in the independent validation dataset (n = 34). The results of this study might contribute to a better understanding of brain function with respect to eating disorder."

NIR spectral signatures of biogenic aggregates, root-aggregates, and non-aggregated soil were obtained together with soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] determinations. The concentrations of C, N and C:N ratio in the three types of soil aggregates identified were not statistically significant (ANOVA, p>0.05) although non-macroaggregated soil had slightly higher C concentrations (66.3 g kg-1 dry soil) than biogenic aggregates (earthworm- and root-aggregates, 64.9 and 63.5 g kg-1 dry soil, respectively), while concentrations of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were highest in the root-attached aggregates (3.3 and 0.31 mg kg dry soil-1). Total earthworm density and biomass in the sampled area was 137.6 ind. m-2, and 55.2 g fresh weight m-2, respectively. The biomass of aggregates attached to roots and non-macroaggregated soil was 122.3 and 134.8 g m-2, respectively, while biomass of free (particulate) organic matter and invertebrate biogenic aggregates was 62.9 and 41.7 g m-2, respectively. Multivariate analysis of NIR spectra signals of field aggregates separated root aggregates with high concentrations of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (41.5% of explained variance, axis I) from those biogenic aggregates, including root aggregates, with large concentrations of C and high C:N ratio (21.6% of total variability, axis II). Partial Least Square (PLS) regressions were used to compare NIR spectral signals of samples (casts and soil) and develop calibration equations relating these spectral data to those data obtained for chemical variables in the lab. After a derivatization process, the NIR spectra of field aggregates were projected onto the PLS factorial plane of the NIR spectra from the lab incubation. The projection of the NIR spectral signals onto the PLSR models for C, N, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] from casts produced and incubated in the lab allowed us to identify the species and the age of the field biogenic aggregates. Our hypothesis was to test whether field aggregates would match or be in the vicinity of the NIR signals that corresponded to a certain species and the age of the depositions produced in the lab. A NIRS biogenic background noise (BBN) is present in the soil as a result of earthworm activity. This study provides insights on how to analyse the role of these organisms in important ecological processes of soil macro-aggregation and associated organic matter dynamics by means of analyzing the BBN in the soil matrix."
https://openalex.org/W3048657167,"In some athletic races, such as cycling and types of speed skating races, athletes have to complete a relatively long distance at a high speed in the presence of direct opponents. To win such a race, athletes are motivated to hide behind others to suppress energy consumption before a final moment of the race. This situation seems to produce a social dilemma: players want to hide behind others, whereas if a group of players attempts to do so, they may all lose to other players that overtake them. To support that speed skaters are involved in such a social dilemma, we analyzed video footage data for 14 mass start skating races to find that skaters that hid behind others to avoid air resistance for a long time before the final lap tended to win. Furthermore, the finish rank of the skaters in mass start races was independent of the record of the same skaters in time-trial races measured in the absence of direct opponents. The results suggest that how to strategically cope with a skater's dilemma may be a key determinant for winning long-distance and high-speed races with direct opponents."

Using 3-dimensional reconstruction, the maximal distance between the planned trajectory and actual lead location was measured. When the distance exceeded the lead body diameter, the lead was considered bent. The distance between the bending point and planned trajectory, and the relative direction between the bending point and lead securing site were analyzed. Changes over time in the range of lead bending and depth were analyzed when possible.A total of 190 implanted leads in 102 patients were analyzed; 104 leads (54.7%) were bent. The average deviation of bent leads was 2.3 mm (range, 1.3-7.1 mm). Thirty-five (18.4%) and seven leads (3.7%) had deviations exceeding twice and three times the lead body diameter, respectively. Angles between the deviation point and securing site at the skull ranged from 135-180° in 83 leads (53.2%), 45-135° in 58 (37.2%), and 0-45° in 15 (9.6%).

https://openalex.org/W3048742530,"The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the neonatal diagnosis-related group scheme in patients affected by respiratory distress syndrome. The variable costs of individual patients in the same group are examined. This study uses the data of infants (N = 243) hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Gaslini Children’s Hospital in Italy in 2016. The care unit’s operating and management costs are employed to estimate the average cost per patient. Operating costs include those related to personnel, drugs, medical supplies, treatment tools, examinations, radiology, and laboratory services. Management costs relate to administration, maintenance, and depreciation cost of medical equipment. Cluster analysis and Tobit regression are employed, allowing for the assessment of the total cost per patient per day taking into account the main cost determinants: birth weight, gestational age, and discharge status. The findings highlight great variability in the costs for patients in the same diagnosis-related group, ranging from a minimum of €267 to a maximum of €265,669. This suggests the inefficiency of the diagnosis-related group system. Patients with very low birth weight incurred costs approximately twice the reimbursement set by the policy; a loss of €36,420 is estimated for every surviving baby with a birth weight lower than 1,170 grams. On the contrary, at term, newborns cost about €20,000 less than the diagnosis-related group reimbursement. The actual system benefits hospitals that mainly treat term infants with respiratory distress syndrome and penalizes hospitals taking care of very low birth weight patients. As a result, strategic behavior and “up-coding” might occur. We conduct a cluster analysis that suggests a birth weight adjustment to determine new fees that would be fairer than the current costs."

Of 295 CHB patients initially treated with LdT, 102 of them who subsequently receiving either adding-on adefovir (group A, n = 58) or switching to TDF (group B, n = 44) for more than 24 months were enrolled. Serial eGFR and qHBsAg levels (3 to 6 monthly) in both LdT monotherapy and rescue therapy periods were analyzed retrospectively. Subsequent decline of qHBsAg especially in rescue therapy period were noted (p<0.001 and p = 0.068 in group A and B). However, patients in group B achieved a significant increase of eGFR (p = 0.010) in LdT monotherapy period but had a significant decline of eGFR (p<0.001) in rescue therapy period. In contrast, patients in group A maintained eGFR levels in both periods. Meanwhile, switch to TDF (hazard ratio: 3.036; 95% confidence interval: 1.040–8.861; p = 0.042) was the sole factor related to the decrease of eGFR>20% from baseline. Both rescue therapies achieved subsequent declines of qHBsAg over time but caused different changes in eGFR. LdT-based rescue therapy maintained eGFR but TDF switching therapy descended eGFR. Therefore, it is essential to monitor patient’s renal function intensively when switching from LdT to TDF as a rescue strategy."
