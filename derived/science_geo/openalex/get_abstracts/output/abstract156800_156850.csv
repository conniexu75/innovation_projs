https://openalex.org/W2165608602,Induced overexpression of AID in CH12F3-2 B lymphoma cells augmented class switching from IgM to IgA without cytokine stimulation. AID deficiency caused a complete defect in class switching and showed a hyper-IgM phenotype with enlarged germinal centers containing strongly activated B cells before or after immunization. AID−/− spleen cells stimulated in vitro with LPS and cytokines failed to undergo class switch recombination although they expressed germline transcripts. Immunization of AID−/− chimera with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP) chicken γ-globulin induced neither accumulation of mutations in the NP-specific variable region gene nor class switching. These results suggest that AID may be involved in regulation or catalysis of the DNA modification step of both class switching and somatic hypermutation.
https://openalex.org/W2002043709,"The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center B cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. We herein report mutations in the human counterpart of AID in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2). Three major abnormalities characterize AID deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. The phenotype observed in HIGM2 patients (and in AID-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for AID in several crucial steps of B cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses."
https://openalex.org/W2092617311,"The small ribosomal subunit performs the decoding of genetic information during translation. The structure of that from Thermus thermophilus shows that the decoding center, which positions mRNA and three tRNAs, is constructed entirely of RNA. The entrance to the mRNA channel will encircle the message when a latch-like contact closes and contributes to processivity and fidelity. Extended RNA helical elements that run longitudinally through the body transmit structural changes, correlating events at the particle's far end with the cycle of mRNA translocation at the decoding region. 96% of the nucleotides were traced and the main fold of all proteins was determined. The latter are either peripheral or appear to serve as linkers. Some may assist the directionality of translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2034804054,"Processing of integral membrane proteins in order to liberate active proteins is of exquisite cellular importance. Examples are the processing events that govern sterol regulation, Notch signaling, the unfolded protein response, and APP fragmentation linked to Alzheimer's disease. In these cases, the proteins are thought to be processed by regulated intramembrane proteolysis, involving site-specific, membrane-localized proteases. Here we show that two homologous yeast transcription factors SPT23 and MGA2 are made as dormant ER/nuclear membrane-localized precursors and become activated by a completely different mechanism that involves ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent processing. SPT23 and MGA2 are relatives of mammalian NF-kappaB and control unsaturated fatty acid levels. Intriguingly, proteasome-dependent processing of SPT23 is regulated by fatty acid pools, suggesting that the precursor itself or interacting partners are sensors of membrane composition or fluidity."
https://openalex.org/W2008721781,"Amphoterin is a protein enhancing process extension and migration in embryonic neurons and in tumor cells through binding to receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multiligand transmembrane receptor. S100 proteins, especially S100B, are abundantly expressed in the nervous system and are suggested to function as cytokines with both neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects. However, the cell surface receptor for the cytokine function of S100B has not been identified. Here we show that two S100 family proteins, S100B and S100A1, activate RAGE in concert with amphoterin inducing neurite outgrowth and activation of transcription factor NF-κB. Furthermore, activation of RAGE by amphoterin and S100B promotes cell survival through increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. However, whereas nanomolar concentrations of S100B induce trophic effects in RAGE-expressing cells, micromolar concentrations of S100B induce apoptosis in an oxidant-dependent manner. Both trophic and toxic effects are specific for cells expressing full-length RAGE since cells expressing a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of RAGE are unresponsive to these stimuli. These findings suggest that activation of RAGE by multiple ligands is able to promote trophic effects whereas hyperactivation of RAGE signaling pathways promotes apoptosis. We suggest that RAGE is a signal-transducing receptor for both trophic and toxic effects of S100B.

Whereas AGE and amyloid-β peptide are known to induce cellular perturbation through their interaction with RAGE, amphoterin and S100 proteins are considered to be physiological ligands of RAGE in migratory and inflammatory cellular responses. However, mechanistically it is not understood how RAGE-mediated cellular responses can change from trophic to toxic. Amphoterin is a heparin-binding, neurite outgrowth-promoting protein that is highly expressed in embryonic and transformed cells (5Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Laitinen J. Wartiovaara J. Rauvala H. J.

Furthermore, amphoterin and RAGE co-localize at the leading edge of advancing neurites in the developing central nervous system (3Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M.

Our previous results suggesting that amphoterin might be a more general regulator of cell migration (reviewed in Ref. 9Rauvala H. Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Kaksonen M. Kinnunen T. Imai S. Raulo E.

Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). S100B is a member of a multigenic family of Ca2+-regulated proteins of the EF-hand type that has been implicated in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, the dynamics of cytoskeleton constituents, the cell cycle, and some enzymes (11Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 12Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). S100B is abundant in the nervous system where it is mainly expressed in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells. S100B has been shown to be released by astrocytes to the extracellular space and to affect astrocytes in an autocrine manner and neurons in a paracrine manner (13Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3063-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Once released, effects of S100B on target cells depend on its concentration. At nanomolar concentrations S100B is trophic in that the protein stimulates neurite outgrowth (13Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moore B.W. Brackenbury R. Ratner N. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), prevents motor neuron degeneration in newborn rats after sciatic nerve section (18Barger S.W. Van Eldik L.J. Mattson M.P. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and local administration of S100B stimulates regeneration of injured rat sciatic nerve in vivo (19Iwasaki Y. Shiojima T. Kinoshita M. J. Neurol. Sci. 1997; 151: 7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All these observations point to a physiological role of secreted S100B as a neurotrophic factor, which could be important during both development and nerve regeneration. However, at micromolar concentrations S100B causes astrocytic and neuronal death via enhanced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in astrocytes and secretion of nitric oxide (20Hu J. Castets F. Guevara J.L. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2543-2547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Owing to these effects, S100B is currently viewed as a brain cytokine (21Griffin W.S. Sheng J.G. Royston M.C. Gentleman S.M. McKenzie J.E. Graham D.I. Roberts G.W. Mrak R.E. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 22Mariggio M.A. Fulle S. Calissano P. Nicoletti I. Fano G. Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Until now, however, the cell surface receptor mediating the cytokine function of S100B has remained unidentified. Recently, nanomolar concentrations of extracellular S100B have been shown to enhance neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth via nuclear translocation of NF-κB (23Alexanian A.R. Bamburg J.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to increase the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in astrocytes (24Goncalves D.S. Lenz G. Karl J. Goncalves C.A. Rodnight R. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that S100B acts on neurons and astrocytes by interacting with a cell surface receptor activating the Ras/MAP kinase/NF-κB signaling pathway. RAGE has been reported to bind both amphoterin (3Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S. Nitecki D. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25752-25761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) and S100B (4Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A.

On the other hand, RAGE ligation has been shown to activate multiple signaling pathways, such as activation of the transcription factor NF-κB through a redox-dependent activation Ras-ERK1/2 pathway (25Lander H.M. Tauras J.M. Ogiste J.S. Hori O. Moss R.A. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17810-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In addition, RAGE ligation is known to activate Cdc42/Rac pathway (8Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), p38, and SAPK/JNK MAP kinase pathways (10Taguchi A. Blood D.C. Del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M. Lu A. Tanaka H. Hori O. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that two S100 family proteins, S100B and S100A1, interact with RAGE on the cell surface in concert with amphoterin inducing neurite outgrowth and increased cell survival. Furthermore, RAGE ligation by amphoterin or S100 proteins results in activation of NF-κB and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. However, when RAGE expressing cells are exposed to micromolar concentrations of S100 proteins cell viability is decreased in an oxidant- and MAP kinase-dependent manner. These results identify RAGE as a receptor capable of mediating both trophic and toxic effects of S100 proteins, and Bcl-2 as a RAGE-induced gene target capable of regulating cellular susceptibility to RAGE-mediated toxic effects. N18 mouse neuroblastoma cells and C6 rat glioma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 10% fetal calf serum. N18 neuroblastoma cells were transfected with Fugene 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To obtain stably transfected clones the cells were first incubated with 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks. Then single cell clones were picked, seeded on 96-well plates, and incubated in the presence of G418 for another 2 weeks. High expression clones were then selected based on mRNA expression levels detected on Northern blots as described previously (8Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The production and purification of baculovirus-expressed rat amphoterin has been described previously (26Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant S100B was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 using the S100B expression vector pVUSB-1 plasmid containing the bovine brain S100B sequence (15Winningham-Major F. Staecker J.L. Barger S.W. Coats S. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3063-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recombinant S100A1 or a truncated form of S100A1 lacking the last six residues (Phe88-Ser93) (S100A1Δ88–93) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-pLysS (Novagen) transformed with an expression plasmid containing the humanS100A1 gene (27Osterloh D. Ivanenkov V.V. Gerke V. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified from bacterial extracts as described (28Donato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 106-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of individual S100s was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% acrylamide). The S100B construct was kindly supplied by Linda J. Van Eldik (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL) and the S100A1 and S100A1Δ88–93 constructs by Volker Gerke (Institute for Medical Biochemistry, University of Münster, Münster, Germany). The peptide TRTKIDWNKILS (TRTK-12), derived from the S100A1- and S100B-binding region of the α-subunit of actin capping protein CapZ, was custom synthesized by Genosys. 96-Well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with the indicated amounts of recombinant amphoterin or one of the S100 proteins in PBS for 30–60 min. The wells were then washed twice with PBS and blocked with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Stably transfected N18 cells were serum-starved for 16–24 h before the assays and then detached with PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, pretreated for 30 min with recombinant proteins in solution, and plated either on plates coated with recombinant proteins or regular tissue culture-treated 96-well plates in the presence of the recombinant proteins. After 20 h in culture the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.5% toluidine blue (Sigma), and the proportions of neurite-bearing cells (processes longer than one diameter of the cell soma) of all cells were counted under an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope. Photomicrographs were taken with Olympus DP-10 CCD camera. Path-Detect Luciferase cis-Reporter-Plasmid system (Promega) was used to detect activation of NF-κB. C6 rat glioma cells were used in order to reach high levels of transfection efficiency in a transient transfection assay. Briefly, cells were transfected (in a 4:2:4 proportion) with a plasmid encoding luciferase cDNA under an enhancer element containing five NF-κB-binding sites, a plasmid containing β-galactosidase and a plasmid containing either wild-type RAGE or a dominant negative RAGE mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain. Cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (8Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). After a 6-h recovery in the presence of serum the cells were serum-starved for 16 h. The cells were then detached with PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, pretreated for 30 min with recombinant S100B in solution in the case of S100B stimulation, and plated either on non-tissue culture-treated plates coated with recombinant amphoterin or regular tissue culture-treated plates in the presence of recombinant S100B. After 24 h in culture the cells were lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were quantitated with either β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System or Luciferase Assay System (Promega) using Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Stably transfected N18 neuroblastoma cells were treated and plated similarly as in the neurite outgrowth assays and cultured for up to 6 days. The viability of cells was assessed by staining with 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) before plating and after 2, 4, or 6 days in culture. The variation in total cell numbers was monitored and was less than 8% between different groups. To visualize intracellular localization of cytochrome c similarly treated RAGE-transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained first with monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen) followed by tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Nuclear morphology was visualized by staining the same cells with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were examined with an Olympus Provis AX-70 fluorescence microscope and photomicrographs were obtained with Photometrics SenSys CCD camera. Caspase-3 activity was measured from cell lysates using EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) based on the fluorometric detection of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin after proteolytic cleavage of the synthetic substrate Z-DEVD-amino-4-methyl coumarin (Z-DEVD-AMC) with Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter. Cells were treated as above and lysed after 48 h. In inhibition assays the cells were pretreated for 30 min with the antioxidants ascorbic acid (Sigma), α-tocopherol (Calbiochem), or a specific MEK-inhibitor U0126 (Calbiochem) before stimulation with 5 μm S100B. Stably transfected N18 neuroblastoma cells were treated as above. After 2 days in culture the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and protein concentrations were measured with a modified Bradford assay as described previously (29Pande S.V. Murthy M.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and electrotransferred on nitrocellulose filters. Bcl-2 was detected with an antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Filters were reprobed with anti-β-tubulin antibodies (Sigma) to confirm equal protein loading. The bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and densitometric analysis was used to measure relative band intensities. RAGE has been previously shown to mediate neurite outgrowth on amphoterin-coated matrices (3Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S. Nitecki D. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25752-25761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth can be abolished by deleting the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE (8Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Since RAGE was recently shown to be a receptor for S100 family proteins in leukocytes and endothelial cells (4Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) and on the other hand S100B has been shown to be a potent activator of neurite extension (13Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 15Winningham-Major F. Staecker J.L. Barger S.W. Coats S. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3063-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), it seemed plausible that RAGE could be the receptor responsible for S100B-induced neurite outgrowth. In order to investigate this we stimulated N18 mouse neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with either full-length human RAGE or a cytoplasmic deletion mutant of RAGE (8Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) with amphoterin and S100B or another S100 family protein S100A1. Serum-starved N18 cells were stimulated with either substrate-bound amphoterin or S100B or S100A1 in solution. Different combinations of the proteins were also tested. RAGE expressing N18 cells grew few neurites on plates coated with 300 nm amphoterin (approximately 6% neurite bearing cells; Fig. 1 A) in comparison to the cells grown on plates coated with 600 nm amphoterin (approximately 20% neurite bearing cells; Fig. 1 D). However, when either S100B (Fig. 1 B) or S100A1 (Fig. 1 C) was added to the medium, neurite outgrowth was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner (black barsin Fig. 1, I and J). This effect seems to be strictly RAGE-dependent as cells expressing the cytoplasmic deletion mutant of RAGE grew hardly any neurites (<3% neurite bearing cells; Fig. 1, E-H, and gray bars in Fig. 1,I and J). Both S100B and S100A1 were capable of inducing RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth when either coated or applied in solution without the presence of amphoterin. Thus it seems that RAGE can mediate neurite outgrowth induced by amphoterin or S100 proteins alone but is also able to promote neurite outgrowth in an additive manner when both amphoterin and S100B or S100A1 are present. Interestingly, S100B and S100A1 at concentrations above 1 μm did not enhance neurite outgrowth but rather led to the decline of morphology of the cells suggesting that these molecules can exert also toxic effects on the cells.Figure 1Coregulation of neurite outgrowth by amphoterin and S100 proteins through RAGE activation.Serum-starved N18 neuroblastoma cells expressing either wild-type RAGE (A-D) or cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of RAGE (E-H) were grown on amphoterin-coated (300 nm inA-C and E-G; 600 nm in Dand H) surfaces with two S100 family proteins, S100B or S100A1 (1 μm). Morphological quantitation of S100B (I) and S100A1 (J)-stimulated cells reveals an additive nature of amphoterin and S100 treatment. The effect of these stimuli on average neurite length (K) is also shown. An average of three replicate experiments plus standard deviation is shown. Statistical significance was determined by Student'st test and p values are shown in the graphs.Bar = 40 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Amphoterin and S100 proteins had also a stimulating effect on neurite length. The average length of neurites in cells grown on plates coated with 600 nm amphoterin or in the presence of either S100B or S100A1 was approximately 40 μm whereas the neurites in cells grown on 300 nm amphoterin-coated plates were only 15 μm long on average (Fig. 1 K). The results showing that both S100B or S100A1 are capable of inducing neurite outgrowth in a RAGE-dependent manner suggest that different S100 proteins share a similar structure involved in RAGE binding. Previously it has been shown that the C-terminal extension of S100 members is responsible for binding of many intracellular ligands of S100 proteins such as annexin I, annexin II, GFAP, tubulin, p53, and the α-subunit of actin capping protein CapZ (27Osterloh D.

To investigate the role of the C-terminal extension of S100A1 in RAGE binding we used a deletion mutant of S100A1 lacking the last six residues (Phe88-Ser93). As shown in Fig. 2, S100A1Δ88–93 displayed similar capability to induce neurite outgrowth on RAGE expressing cells as the wild-type S100A1. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide TRTK-12, derived from the S100A1- and S100B-binding region of actin capping protein CapZ (31Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson G.A.J. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V. J. Biol.

A hallmark of RAGE ligation is activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (4Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T.

Cells were transfected with full-length RAGE or the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of RAGE together with the NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid. Also a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Non-treated mock-transfected cells were used as a control of basal transcriptional activity. RAGE expressing cells grown on amphoterin-coated (300 nm) matrix showed an activation to 147.1 ± 3.0% of the control level in NF-κB-dependent transcription. The corresponding values in the cells treated with 100 nm S100B, 100 nmS100A1, 300 nm coated amphoterin with 100 nmS100B, 300 nm coated amphoterin with 100 nmS100A1, and 600 nm coated amphoterin were 186.8 ± 4.0%, 180.9 ± 4.8%, 206.1 ± 10.9%, 203.9 ± 13.4%, and 199.4 ± 11.3%, respectively (black bars, Fig. 3). Cells expressing the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant did not show significant changes in NF-κB-dependent transcription in response to any of these stimuli (gray bars in Fig. 3). These results show that both S100B and S100A1 are able to activate NF-κB either alone or in a noncompetitive manner together with amphoterin through binding to RAGE on the cell surface. In addition to neurite outgrowth, S100B has also been shown to promote cell survival in specific neuronal populations (16Van Eldik L.J. Christie-Pope B. Bolin L.M. Shooter E.M. Whetsell Jr., W.O.

Src, the product of the first characterized proto-oncogene and the first identified protein tyrosine kinase, plays a critical role in the signal transduction of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the mechanism of biochemical regulation of Src by G proteins is not known. Here we demonstrate that Galphas and Galphai, but neither Galphaq, Galpha12 nor Gbetay, directly stimulate the kinase activity of downregulated c-Src. Galphas and Galphai similarly modulate Hck, another member of Src-family tyrosine kinases. Galphas and Galphai bind to the catalytic domain and change the conformation of Src, leading to increased accessibility of the active site to substrates. These data demonstrate that the Src family tyrosine kinases are direct effectors of G proteins."

Proteins containing the Dbl homology (DH) domain are responsible for activating Rho GTPases by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP. Receptor-initiated stimulation of Dbl protein Vav exchange activity involves tyrosine phosphorylation. We show through structure determination that the mVav1 DH domain is autoinhibited by an N-terminal extension, which lies in the GTPase interaction site. This extension contains the Tyr174 Src-family kinase recognition site, and phosphorylation or truncation of this peptide results in stimulation of GEF activity. NMR spectroscopy data show that the N-terminal peptide is released from the DH domain and becomes unstructured upon phosphorylation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation relieves autoinhibition by exposing the GTPase interaction surface of the DH domain, which is obligatory for Vav activation."

Despite the wealth of in vitro data, convincing evidence for any functional repercussion of the phosphorylation of protein tau by GSK-3β in vivo is lacking and the requirement of protein tau phosphorylation for PHF formation is still a matter of debate. We generated transgenic mice that overexpress a constitutively active form of the human kinase, i.e. GSK-3β(S9A) with serine at position 9 replaced by alanine to prevent its inactivation by phosphorylation (40Stambolic V.

Interestingly, protein tau hyperphosphorylation correlates with a strong reduction in the number of axonal dilations and with a nearly complete alleviation of the motoric problems observed in htau40 transgenic mice. A 2-fold increase in GSK-3β activity, relative to the endogenous enzymatic activity, thereby rescues nearly all neuropathological symptoms of the single htau40 transgenic mice (42Spittaels K.

Four htau40-1 and htau40-1 × GSK-3β transgenic mice were used, quantitative Western blot analysis was carried out using Tau-5 antibody and the amount of protein tau in the different buffers was determined, with the total transgenic human protein tau taken as 100%. The GSK-3β(S9A) protein levels in brain and spinal cord extracts were estimated by Western blotting with the monoclonal antibody TPK-I/GSK-3β (Affinity, Nottingham, United Kingdom). The GSK-3β enzymatic activity was measured in brain homogenates after immunoprecipitation and fractionation by cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (56Van Lint J.

The blots for tubulin were developed with an antibody specific for neuronal β-III anti-N-tubulin (Promega, Madison, WI). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate the differences. Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with paraformaldehyde (4% in phosphate-buffered saline). Brain and spinal cord were immersion-fixed overnight and cut sagitally into two hemispheres or transversally into four tissue blocks of 9 mm, respectively. Vibratome sections (40 μm) were cut from the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere was dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and used for microtome sectioning (6 μm). Likewise, vibratome sections were cut from the thoracal part of the spinal cord, whereas the thoracolumbal part was embedded in paraffin. Primary antibodies used were monoclonal antibodies for protein tau (HT-7) and for GSK-3β (TPK-I) (Affinity), a polyclonal antiserum against synaptophysin (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), the monoclonal antibody SMI-32 for detection of neurofilament proteins (Affinity), and an antiserum to GFAP (Dako).

The pathogenesis of this complex disease is poorly understood, and no efficient therapy or prevention exists to date. A precondition for AMD appears to be the accumulation of the age pigment lipofuscin in lysosomes of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. In AMD, these cells seem to die by apoptosis with subsequent death of photoreceptor cells, and light may accelerate the disease process. Intracellular factors leading to cell death are not known. Here we show that the lipophilic cation N-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine (A2E), a lipofuscin component, induces apoptosis in RPE and other cells at concentrations found in human retina. Apoptosis is accompanied by the appearance of the proapoptotic proteins cytochromec and apoptosis-inducing factor in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Biochemical examinations show that A2E specifically targets cytochrome oxidase (COX). With both isolated mitochondria and purified COX, A2E inhibits oxygen consumption synergistically with light. Inhibition is reversed by the addition of cytochrome c or cardiolipin, a negatively charged phospholipid that facilitates the binding of cytochrome c to membranes. Succinate dehydrogenase activity is not altered by A2E. We suggest that A2E can act as a proapoptotic molecule via a mitochondria-related mechanism, possibly through site-specific targeting of this cation to COX. Loss of RPE cell viability through inhibition of mitochondrial function might constitute a pivotal step toward the progressive degeneration of the central retina. 10–20% of individuals over the age of 65 suffer from age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of severe visual impairment in humans living in developed countries.

It is generally believed that the accumulation of the autofluorescent age pigment lipofuscin in RPE cell phagolysosomes constitutes a predicament for the development of the disease. Lipofuscin accumulation and the formation of drusen and other deposits in the region of Bruch's membrane, which separates the pigment epithelium from the underlying choroid are considered initial steps in the pathogenesis of AMD. Drusen formation may be the result of progressive death and/or exocytosis of RPE cells in the central retina (14Eldred G.E.

Lipofuscin harbors two unusual retinoids, the lipophilic cationsN-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine (A2E) and its isoform, iso-A2E, first isolated from the eyes of old individuals (16Eldred G.E.

During AMD, RPE cells may be lost by apoptosis as evidenced with human autopsy eyes (18Xu G.Z. Li W.W. Tso M.O. Trans. Am. Ophthalmol. Soc. 1996; 94: 411-430PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a form of cell death that, in addition to its physiological importance in tissue development and homeostasis (19Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar), plays a major role in diseases such as cancer, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, autoimmune diseases, and tissue degeneration (for a review, see Ref. 20Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are important control centers of apoptosis (21Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat.

When they are destabilized, for example by oxidative stress, they release apoptosis-inducing proteins. One is cytochrome c, which in the cytoplasm often but not always (23Leist M. Single B. Naumann H. Fava E. Simon B. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) activates caspases, apoptosis-specific proteases. Another protein is apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which induces nuclear apoptosis independently of caspase activation (24Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G.

Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Present knowledge suggests that mitochondria function as cellular sensors of stress into which different apoptosis induction pathways converge and that mitochondria act as central executioners of apoptosis (26Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). We show here that A2E induces apoptosis in cultures of various mammalian cell types, including RPE cells. A2E-induced apoptosis is preceded by a decline in mitochondrial activity and is accompanied by translocation of cytochrome c and AIF into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Biochemical experiments suggest that A2E targets directly the function of COX, whereas respiratory chain activity upstream of cytochrome c is not affected by A2E. We propose that A2E can induce apoptosis by mobilizing cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria. Our findings give insight into the molecular mechanism underlying A2E's cytotoxicity and suggest strategies to retard or overcome AMD. 8-Day-old specific pathogen free BALB/c mice were obtained from the Animal Unit of the University of Constance, and female Wistar rats were from the Animal Unit of the Institute of Biochemistry (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich).

RPE cells were prepared from porcine eyes obtained from a local slaughterhouse essentially as described previously (27Esser P. Grisanti S. Kociok N. Abts H. Hueber A. Unfried K. Heimann K. Weller M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 2852-2856PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the culture was verified by immunohistochemical staining with anti-cytokeratin antibodies (Sigma c-2931). Experiments were performed with passage 1–2 RPE cells that were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin. Murine cerebellar granule cells (CGC) were isolated from 8-day-old BALB/c mice and cultured as described (28Schousboe A. Meier E. Dreijer J. Hertz L. Sahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. A. R. Liss, New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). Contamination with nonneuronal cells (β-III-tubulin-negative) was <5%. Dissociated neurons were plated on 100 μg/ml (250 μg/ml for glass surfaces) poly-l-lysine ( > 300 kDa)-coated dishes at a density of about 0.25 × 106 cells/cm2(800,000 cells/ml; 500 μl/well, 24-well plate) and cultured in Eagle's basal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 20 mm KCl, 2 mml-glutamine plus penicillin/streptomycin, and cytosine arabinoside (10 μm; added 48 h after plating). CGC were used without further medium changes after 5 days in culture. The cells were exposed to A2E in their original medium in the presence of 2 μm(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK801; Biotrend Chemikalien GmbH) and 2 mmMg2+ to preventN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and excitotoxicity (29Leist M.

Med. 1999; 5: 477-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis and secondary lysis were routinely quantified by double staining of neuronal cultures with 1 μg/ml H-33342 (membrane-permeant, blue fluorescent chromatin stain; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 0.5 μm SYTOX (non-membrane-permeant, green fluorescent chromatin stain; Molecular Probes) as described previously (31Leist M. Fava E. Montecucco C. Nicotera P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1488-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were characterized by scoring typically condensed nuclei. About 200–300 cells were counted in two or three different culture wells, and experiments were repeated with at least three different preparations. In addition, mitochondrial activity was quantified by the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrasodium bromide (MTT) (incubation for 60 min with 0.5 mg MTT/ml). CGC were grown on glass-bottomed culture dishes, fixed after the experiment with 4% paraformadehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (for cytochrome c) or 0.1% SDS (for AIF). Staining of cytochrome c(anti-cytochrome c antibody; clone 6H2.B4, Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany) was performed as described (33Single B. Leist M. Nicotera P. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Latta M. Kunstle G. Leist M. Wendel A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1975-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-AIF serum (24Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) was used at a dilution of 1:500. AlexaTM-568 coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:300; Molecular Probes) served as secondary antibody. CGC were embedded in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol and 0.5 μg/ml H-33342 and imaged by confocal microscopy (TCS-4D UV/VIS confocal scanning system; Leica AG, Benzheim, and Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg, Germany). A2E shows a strong green and red fluorescence when excited at 488 or 568 nm. The red fluorescence is very photolabile and can be eliminated by short illumination with a 50-watt lamp. Thereafter A2E fluorescence in the green channel was easily distinguished from the fluorescence of red-emitting fluorophores used for co-staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential in CGC was monitored as described (23Leist M. Single B. Naumann H. Fava E. Simon B. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Leist M. Volbracht C. Fava E. Nicotera P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) after loading cells with 5 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethylester (TMRE; Molecular Probes) on a coverslip-bottomed cell culture dish. The images were obtained with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS-4D; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) and a × 63, NA 1.32 lens. For dissipation of the membrane potential, carbonylcyanide-3-chlorophenylhydrazone was added to the cultures. The decay of TMRE fluorescence (excitation, 568 nm; emission, > 586 nm) and of A2E fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, >515 nm) was monitored individually in control experiments or simultaneously with A2E fluorescence (A2E emission filter set to 520 ± 10 nm). A2E and iso-A2E were synthesized from all-trans-retinal and ethanolamine as described (17Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and purified chromatographically on silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates using the primary developing system (35Eldred G.E. Katz M.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A2E andiso-A2E, the former being the faster moving band, were detected on the plates by their fluorescence upon illumination with 366-nm light. The material containing A2E and iso-A2E was scraped off, eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (30/25/4), dried, and rechromatographed. Stock solutions of A2E and iso-A2E were stored in Me2SO at −20 °C in the dark. Total A2E diluted into methanol was quantified using a molar extinction coefficient of 36,900 at 439 nm (17Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). For HPLC, total A2E was loaded onto a reversed phase column (Nucleosil 100–5 C18; 150 × 4.6 mm; Macherey-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) and eluted with a gradient of methanol (plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in water (86–100% in 20 min). A2E and iso-A2E were detected at 436 nm with a peak maximum at 16 and 19 min, respectively. Photoisomerization was induced by illuminating purified A2E or iso-A2E with white light (70 watts, at 14-cm distance). The extent of isomerization was analyzed by HPLC analysis (see above). The isomers reached equilibrium in about 10 min. A2E was diluted into the RPE cell culture medium to a concentration of 25 μm A2E and 0.5% Me2SO. Control incubations were done with 0.5% Me2SO in the absence of A2E as negative control and with 0.5 μm staurosporine as positive control. Incubation was at 37 °C with 5% CO2for 24 h in darkness. For TUNEL staining (TUNEL assay; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), formaldehyde-fixed cells were equilibrated in 30 mm Tris, 140 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, treated with terminal transferase (0.25 units/μl) and biotin-dUTP (20 μm) in the above buffer containing 1 mmcobalt chloride for 60–90 min at 37 °C, washed in 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, for 15 min, rinsed twice in H2O, blocked for 10 min with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:500 in 100 mmTris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, rinsed five times in H2O, and developed using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a substrate. The slides were not counterstained. After incubation with A2E (50 μm; 0.5% Me2SO; 16 h; 5% CO2; 37 °C; darkness), cells were scraped from the plates, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaCl. SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and proteins were digested with proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 h. Fresh proteinase K was added (0.2 mg/ml), and incubation was continued for 4 h at 50 °C. The mixture was extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) and twice with chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1). NaCl (final concentration 300 mm) and ethanol (2.5 volumes) were added, and DNA was precipitated overnight at −20 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 × g (4 °C), DNA was washed once with 70% ethanol and air-dried for 1 h at room temperature. 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, were added, and DNA was allowed to rehydrate for 2 days at 4 °C. RNA was digested by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with 20 μg of RNase A. DNA concentration was determined by A260reading. 15 μg of total DNA were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with SybrGreen (Molecular Probes). Liver mitochondria were obtained from overnight-starved rats weighing 200 g by differential centrifugation (36Schlegel J. Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). COX was isolated from rat liver as described (37Aldez I.Z. Cascarano J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1977; 9: 237-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured at 28 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH) under continuous stirring. Mitochondria were diluted to 1 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml in a buffer containing 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin/ml. A2E was added to the mitochondrial suspension before rotenone (5 μm) and succinate (0.4–1.2 mm). The reaction time was normally 4 min or as indicated. Cytochromec (1 μm) or cardiolipin (1 μg/ml) was added as indicated. COX (263 μg/ml) assays were performed in 40 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 50 μm EDTA with 1 mm ascorbate and 0.4 mmtetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine.

Sci. 2000; 41: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular details of A2E toxicity, we isolated and cultured pig RPE cells and exposed them to increasing concentrations of A2E. Application of as little as 25 μmA2E, which results in an intracellular content of A2E found in human eyes (40Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar), induces apoptosis in PRE cells within 24 h as evidenced by the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of genomic DNA (Fig. 1 A) and positive TUNEL staining (Fig. 1 B). The latter was comparable with the staining caused by staurosporine, a known apoptosis-inducing agent (Fig. 1 C), and was not detected in cells exposed to solvent alone (Fig. 1 D). Mitochondria participate in the execution of apoptosis induced by many agents, including lipophilic cations (29Leist M. Volbracht C. Fava E. Nicotera P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and can release proapoptotic proteins. This is often but not always followed by activation of proteases known as caspases. Because we suspected an involvement of mitochondria in cell death induced by the lipophilic cation A2E, we also investigated cerebellar granule cells (CGC), in which mitochondria abound. Significant apoptotic death was induced in these cells at A2E concentrations of >10 μm. Interestingly, already lower A2E concentrations decreased mitochondrial function as measured by the MTT assay (Fig. 2) or a decrease in TMRE fluorescence (not shown). The decline in mitochondrial activity precedes the death of CGC (Fig. 2). These cells accumulate A2E in mitochondria as shown by comparison of the localization of A2E with the mitochondrial marker TMRE (Fig. 3 A). We found that after deenergization of mitochondria in CGC A2E is for presently unknown reasons retained much longer than TMRE in the organelles (Fig. 3 B), an observation confirmed with isolated rat liver mitochondria. 2C. Richter, unpublished result. The cells release in response to A2E the proapoptotic proteins cytochromec (Fig. 4, A–F) and AIF (Fig. 4, G–M) from mitochondria into the cytoplasm and nucleus. The two other cell types tested, the neuroblastoma lines CHP-100 and SH-SY5Y, also underwent apoptosis when exposed to A2E in a similar concentration range (data not shown). In none of the cell types investigated was death induced by A2E apparently related to caspase activation, since death was not preventable by 100 μmbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone or other established caspase inhibitors (data not shown). Similarly, A2E treatment did not activate caspase-3 in cultured RPE cells (data not shown).Figure 3A2E is localized in mitochondria. CGC cultures were exposed to A2E (20 μm) for 6 h. Solvent (A) or carbonylcyanide-3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 100 μm) (B) was added, and live neurons were stained with TMRE and H-33342 and imaged by multichannel confocal microscopy.

To gain insight into the mechanism by which A2E induces apoptosis, we investigated the response of isolated mitochondria and COX to A2E. Fig. 5 shows that oxygen consumption by mitochondria respiring on succinate is suppressed by A2E in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A), A2E being more potent in the light than in the dark (Fig. 5, B andC). In contrast to A2E, iso-A2E inhibits respiration only marginally (Fig. 5 B), most of the observed inhibition being attributable to the conversion by light ofiso-A2E to A2E. The A2E-induced inhibition is apparently due to detachment of cytochrome c from mitochondria, because inhibition can be overcome by added cytochrome c or cardiolipin (Fig. 5, C and D). When cardiolipin is added before A2E, the latter is slightly less effective than when the order of addition is reversed (Fig. 5 D, trace a versus trace b). Although the difference is not very pronounced, it was observed in every experiment (n = 4). Succinate-ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity, which reflects electron flow from succinate via its dehydrogenase to cytochrome bc1, was not affected by A2E, nor was the reduction of cytochrome c by the artificial electron donor dithionite (data not shown). Cardiolipin facilitates the binding of cytochrome c to COX-containing membranes (43Salamon Z. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 858-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The above results strongly suggest that A2E inhibits mitochondrial respiration because it prevents cytochromec binding to the inner mitochondrial membrane and thereby interrupts electron flow between cytochrome bc1and COX. To substantiate this, we measured oxygen consumption of isolated COX. This is possible when electrons are provided by ascorbate and mediated to cytochrome c by the dye tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Fig. 6 A shows that also in this well defined system, comprising besides the electron donor/mediator only two proteins and COX-bound cardiolipin, A2E inhibits oxygen consumption dose-dependently. Again, inhibition is counteracted by cardiolipin addition (Fig. 6 B,trace a versus trace b). When cardiolipin is added before A2E in this system, A2E is totally ineffective (Fig. 6, B, trace c versus trace d). As with mitochondria, iso-A2E inhibited COX only marginally (data not shown).

We have found a number of human breast cancer cell lines with elevated c-Src specific activity that also possess elevated phosphatase activity directed against the carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory domain of Src family kinases. To identify this phosphatase, cell extracts from MDA-MB-435S cells were chromatographed and the fractions were assayed for phosphatase activity. Four peaks of phosphatase activity directed against the nonspecific substrate poly(Glu/Tyr) were detected. One peak also dephosphorylated a peptide modeled against the c-Src carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory domain and intact human c-Src. Immunoblotting and immunodepletion experiments identified the phosphatase as protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Examination of several human breast cancer cell lines with increased c-Src activity showed elevated levels of PTP1B protein relative to normal control breast cells.In vitro c-Src reactivation experiments confirmed the ability of PTP1B to dephosphorylate and activate c-Src. In vivo overexpression of PTP1B in 293 cells caused a 2-fold increase of endogenous c-Src kinase activity.

When activated, c-Src is capable of phosphorylating a variety of intracellular substrates, with consequent effects on downstream signaling pathways affecting cell division, cell differentiation, and cell mobility. Because of its potent ability to influence cellular functions, c-Src is normally maintained in an inactive state. Within the cell, CSK1 and CSK-homologous kinase phosphorylates Tyr-530 within the carboxyl-terminal tail of human c-Src (Tyr-530 of human c-Src is equivalent to Tyr-527 of chicken c-Src) (2Nada S.

These mutants have typically been identified by their ability to cause cellular transformation, and it appears that constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src is a potent transforming signal. Because c-Src has the potential to transform cells when activated, investigators have examined whether c-Src might contribute to the transformed phenotype of human cancers. Elevations in c-Src kinase activity have been noted in a variety of human cancers, particularly in colon and breast cancers (20Cartwright C.A. Kamps M.P. Meisler A.I. Pipas J.M. Eckhart W. J. Clin.

Several mechanisms have been implicated in causing these elevations in c-Src kinase activity in tumors, including elevations in Src protein levels, elevations in Src specific activity, and mutations within c-Src that disrupt normal regulation (20Cartwright C.A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have recently reported elevations in Src kinase activity in 30–40% of human breast cancer cell lines tested (29Egan C. Pang A. Durda D. Cheng H.C. Wang J.H. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These increases in activity were attributable, in most cases, to increases in both Src specific activity and protein levels. Interestingly, the breast cancer cell lines exhibiting elevated c-Src activity were also found to possess high levels of PTPase activity capable of dephosphorylating a synthetic peptide (FCP) modeled against the negative regulatory region of Src family members. When the FCP phosphatase activity was quantitated, we found 4.8–9.6-fold higher activity in the transformed cells as compared with normal control cells. Because this tyrosine phosphatase activity might play an important role in c-Src regulation and activation in breast cancer, we have extended these studies by partially purifying and identifying the phosphatase responsible for the Src dephosphorylation activity as PTP1B. We demonstrate that PTP1B has the potential to activate c-Src by dephosphorylation of its negative regulatory site and suggest that PTP1B and c-Src might act together to contribute to the development and/or progression of human breast cancer. pJ3H vector containing full-length human PTP1B was a kind gift of Dr. J. Chernoff. The pFLAG-CMV-2 mammalian expression vector was from Eastman Kodak Co. pBluescript vector was from Stratagene. Anti-PTP1B antibody was from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. 2-17 and 327 anti-Src monoclonal antibodies were from Quality Biotech and from a hybridoma provided by Dr. Joan Brugge, respectively. Recombinant human c-Src and CSK were expressed and purified as described previously (30Bjorge J.D. Bellagamba C. Cheng H.C. Tanaka A. Wang J.H. Fujita D.J. J. Biol.

Recombinant GST-PTP1B consisting of glutathione S-transferase fused to the first 321 amino acids of human PTP1B was expressed and purified as described previously (32Jung E.J. Kang Y.S. Kim C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Poly(Glu/Tyr) was from Sigma. FCP and cdc2 synthetic peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) and have been previously described (30Bjorge J.D. Bellagamba C. Cheng H.C. Tanaka A. Wang J.H. Fujita D.J. J.

Thin layer cellulose chromatography plates were from Kodak. The human breast cell lines and 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All the breast cancer cell lines and the 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Both the peptide substrates poly(Glu/Tyr) (348 μg/ml) and FCP (830 μm) were labeled in 115 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 2.2 μm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, and 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). For labeling poly(Glu/Tyr), 2.5 μg of purified recombinant c-Src, and for labeling FCP, 1.0 μg of purified recombinant CSK, were added to the tubes containing reaction buffer and the corresponding peptide and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Following the phosphorylation reaction, the labeled peptides were separated from unincorporated ATP by chromatography on 5-ml gel filtration columns. The column running buffer consisted of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl. Poly(Glu/Tyr) was chromatographed on Sephadex G-50 and FCP on Sephadex G-25 (set up in disposable plastic 5-ml pipettes). The peak fractions containing the labeled peptides were pooled and stored frozen at −20 °C until use. Recombinant c-Src for use as a phosphatase substrate was prepared as follows; 2 μg of purified recombinant c-Src was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 2 μg of purified recombinant CSK in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 μm ATP, and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). After the phosphorylation reaction, free ATP was separated from the labeled c-Src by chromatography on a 5.0-ml plastic disposable column containing Sephadex G-50 in buffer composed of 50 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Batches of 10 15-cm plastic tissue culture plates of cells at 75% confluence were washed two times with PBS. The cells were then scraped into 40 ml of ice-cold PTPase lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The scraped cell extract was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 8,000 ×g. The extract was then filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter prior to loading on the Q-Sepharose column. Cell extracts were chromatographed on a 2.6 × 9-cm Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10% glycerol. After sample loading, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmDTT). The bound proteins were eluted with a 700-ml 0–0.5 mNaCl gradient, followed by 100 ml of 0.5–1.0 m NaCl (NaCl solutions were made up in low salt buffer). 40 fractions consisting of 20-ml volumes each were collected and assayed for protein content, phosphatase activity, and the presence of various specific tyrosine phosphatases by immunoblot analysis. 20-μl samples to be tested for phosphatase activity were combined with buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5.0 mm EDTA, 5.0 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 5.0 mm NaK-tartrate, 1.0 mm tetramisole, 1 mm DTT, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μl final reaction volume). Phosphatase substrates (FCP, poly(Glu/Tyr), or recombinant c-Src) were added and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μl of 50% (v/v) acetic acid. 50 μl from each reaction tube was spotted onto 1.5 × 2.0-cm pieces of either 3MM filter paper (poly(Glu/Tyr) substrate) or P-81 phosphocellulose paper (FCP or recombinant c-Src substrates). The filter papers were then washed five times with either 10% trichloroacetic acid (poly(Glu/Tyr) substrate) or 0.43% (v/v) phosphoric acid (FCP or recombinant c-Src substrates), rinsed once with acetone, and air-dried before quantitation by scintillation counting. PTP1B or control rabbit antibody was preimmobilized on protein G-agarose by first incubating the antibody with protein G-agarose. 3 μg of PTP1B or control antibody/20-μl portion of packed protein G-agarose beads was incubated for 1 h at 20 °C on a rotator. The antibody beads were then washed two times with buffer containing 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The beads were then aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes such that each immunodepletion tube contained 3 μg of antibody bound to 20-μl beads, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 s, and all supernatant was removed. Cell extracts or column fractions to be tested for the presence of PTP1B were initially quantitated by the FCP dephosphorylation assay. The samples were then diluted with Q-Sepharose low salt buffer supplemented to contain 150 mm NaCl such that (a) their activities fell within a quantifiable region of the assay and (b) their activities were approximately equal. The diluted samples were then added to tubes containing PTP1B or control rabbit IgG antibody beads and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant removed, a portion of the supernatant saved for the FCP phosphatase assay, and the remainder transferred to a tube containing a new antibody bead pellet. The incubation, centrifugation, and transfer of supernatant to a fresh tube containing immobilized antibody was repeated twice more for a total of three cycles over the antibody beads. Three cycles of immunodepletion under these conditions was found to quantitatively remove greater than 95% of the PTP1B in test samples. For the inactivation step of the assay, 40 ng of purified recombinant c-Src was incubated with 1 μg of purified recombinant CSK in a 35-μl final volume of kinase buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm DTT, and 50 μm ATP. In experiments where the phosphorylation status of c-Src was examined, 35 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was also added to label the c-Src. This reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped and the c-Src immunoprecipitated by the addition of 35 μl of SDB buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) that also contained 20 mm EDTA and 1.5 μg of 2–17 anti-Src antibody. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, 15 μl of protein G-agarose was added and further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads containing the immune complexes were then washed three times with SDB buffer and all the supernatant aspirated. For the reactivation step of the assay, GST-PTP1B was diluted in SDB buffer, added to the bead pellets containing inactivated c-Src, and incubated 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with SDB buffer containing 200 μm sodium orthovanadate and 4 mg/ml p-nitrophenolphosphate, and c-Src kinase activity was measured. Cells in tissue culture dishes were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. They were then lysed in 0.80 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0% sodium deoxycholate), supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 3 mg/mlp-nitrophenolphosphate, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). c-Src was immunoprecipitated by the addition of 1 μg of 327 anti-Src antibody to 300 μg of cell extract for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 15 μl of protein G-agarose on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complexes were washed four times with RIPA buffer (supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors) and once with SDB buffer. c-Src kinase activity was measured in the immmunoprecipitates by the addition of 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 30 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 100 μmsynthetic peptide substrate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 4 mg/ml p-nitrophenolphosphate. Following incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, 25 μl of 50% (v/v) acetic acid was added to each tube, after which 50 μl was spotted onto a 1.5 × 2.0-cm square of P-81 phosphocelluose paper. The filter papers were then washed with dilute phosphoric acid as described in the dephosphorylation assay. Samples to undergo phosphopeptide mapping were initially resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed and washed on a orbital shaker for 1 h each in three solutions containing, respectively, 250 ml of 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid, 250 ml of 20% methanol and 5% acetic acid, and 250 ml of 10% methanol and 2.5% acetic acid. The gel was then dried between two sheets of clear cellulose, exposed to x-ray film, and the radioactive bands excised from the dried gel. The gel slices were rehydrated in 10% methanol, tweezers were used to remove the cellulose, and the 10% methanol was pipetted from the acrylamide slices and discarded. The slices were then dried on a SpeedVac. To generate chymotryptic fragments of the c-Src protein, 500 μl of 0.05 mNH4HCO3 containing 3 μg of chymotrypsin was added to each tube and the tubes were incubated at 35 °C for 4 h in a shaking water bath. 100 μl of 0.05 mNH4HCO3 containing 1 μg of chymotrypsin was further added to each tube, incubated for 2 h, and repeated once. The supernatant containing the majority of the chymotryptic peptide fragments was then collected. Complete elution of the digested peptides from the gel slices was facilitated by further incubation of the gel slices for 2 h with 0.5 ml of 0.05 mNH4HCO3, followed by two incubations with 0.75 ml of water for 2 h each at 35 °C in a shaking water bath. After each incubation, the supernatants containing eluted peptides were pooled with the original supernatant and dried on the SpeedVac. This procedure ensured complete recovery of the chymotryptic protein fragments (recovery, as measured by transfer of radioactivity from the gel slices to the pooled supernatants was typically greater than 95%). Each digested sample was then resuspended in 500 μl of water, and redried. This was repeated three times to ensure efficient removal of the NH4HCO3. The samples were resuspended in 5–10 μl of water and were applied to a 20 × 20-cm cellulose thin layer chromatography plate. The peptides were separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis at pH 4.72 in a buffer containing n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (2/1/1/36) for 1 h at 800 V using a Savant thin layer electrophoresis apparatus. The peptides were then separated in the second dimension by chromatography in buffer containingn-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (15/10/3/12). The plates were then dried in a fume hood overnight and subjected to autoradiography. In situations where quantitation of the phosphopeptides was necessary, imaging of the thin layer plates was carried out with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The identification of the phosphopeptide spots was made by comparison with phosphorylated synthetic peptides containing Tyr-419 and Tyr-530, by comparison with recombinant c-Src that had been subjected to either autophosphorylation or CSK phosphorylation (Tyr-419 and Tyr-530, respectively), and by phosphoamino acid analysis and mobility during electrophoresis/chromatography (Ser-17) (results not shown). Mammalian expression vectors expressing FLAG-tagged human PTP1B were constructed. pJ3H containing either full-length wild-type human PTP1B or a catalytically inactive mutant form of full-length PTP1B possessing a point mutation (C215S) (34Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were digested with BamHI to release a 1.4-kilobase pair fragment containing the entire human PTP1B coding region. The BamHI fragment was ligated into BamHI-digested pFLAG-CMV-2 mammalian expression vector. This expression vector produces amino-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length PTP1B under the control of the CMV promoter. 293 human embryonal kidney cells in 3.5-cm dishes at approximately 50% confluence were transiently transfected with 4 μg of purified plasmid containing of the FLAG-tagged constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. All plasmids used in transfection protocols were purified using a Qiagen endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell culture medium was changed once 24 h after transfection, and the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer 48 h after transfection. 293 cells to be labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were grown to approximately 75% confluence in 6-cm tissue culture dishes. The cells were rinsed once with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 8 h in 3 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 9% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl), and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. The cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer (supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors), c-Src was immunoprecipitated, and the immune complex resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Our laboratory has previously reported elevated levels of Src tyrosine kinase activity in approximately 30–40% of the human breast cancer cell lines examined (29Egan C. Pang A. Durda D. Cheng H.C. Wang J.H. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The increase in kinase activity was due to both elevations in Src specific activity as well as protein levels. These increases in c-Src activity were correlated with elevations in the activity of an unknown phosphatase that was capable of dephosphorylating a synthetic peptide modeled against the negative regulatory carboxyl terminus of Src family members. We have now extended these investigations by carrying out experiments to purify and identify from human breast cancer cell lines the phosphatase responsible for this activity. Chromatography of crude cell extracts from MDA-MB-435S cells, a human breast cancer cell line that exhibited elevated c-Src kinase activity, on a Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column revealed that the PTPase activity capable of dephosphorylating the nonspecific phosphatase substrate poly(Glu/Tyr) was broadly spread over four peaks (Fig. 1, upper panel, ♦). The first (fractions 11 and 12) and second (fractions 14–17) peaks possessed the majority of the phosphatase activity, whereas the third (fractions 19–21) and fourth (fraction 23) peaks possessed lower amounts of activity. The same column fractions were then assayed for their ability to dephosphorylate a synthetic peptide, FCP, modeled against the carboxyl-terminal regulatory region of Src-family members (Fig. 1, lower panel, ▴). Virtually all of the PTPase activity capable of dephosphorylating the FCP peptide was found to elute in fractions corresponding to the second peak of poly(Glu/Tyr) phosphatase activity (fractions 14–17). Next, we wanted to confirm that the second peak of phosphatase activity would also be capable of dephosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal regulatory tyrosine (Tyr-530) in the intact c-Src molecule. The c-Src protein, when phosphorylated on Tyr-530, is folded such that its carboxyl terminus interacts with its SH2 domain, and as a result, a peptide might behave differently than the intact c-Src protein. Recombinant c-Src was phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of radioactive ATP and an excess amount of recombinant CSK, a tyrosine kinase that specifically targets Tyr-530 in c-Src. This phosphorylated c-Src product was then used as a substrate for the phosphatase activity in the column fractions (Fig. 1, lower panel, ●). In"

Here we describe a microtubule guidance mechanism that orients microtubules in the intracellular space along the long axis of the cell, guiding them to their target region at the cell ends. This mechanism involves tip1p, a CLIP170-like protein that localizes to distal tips of cytoplasmic microtubules. In the absence of tip1p, microtubular catastrophe is no longer restricted to cell ends but occurs when microtubules reach any region of the cellular cortex. Thus, tip1p enables microtubules to discriminate different cortical regions and regulates their dynamics accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2131007513,"Regulation of eukaryotic gene expression requires ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, such as SWI/SNF, and histone acetyltransferases, such as Gcn5p. Here we show that SWI/SNF remodeling controls recruitment of Gcn5p HAT activity to many genes in late mitosis and that these chromatin remodeling enzymes play a role in regulating mitotic exit. In contrast, interphase expression of GAL1, HIS3, PHO5, and PHO8 is accompanied by SWI/SNF-independent recruitment of Gcn5p HAT activity. Surprisingly, prearresting cells in late mitosis imposes a requirement for SWI/SNF in recruiting Gcn5p HAT activity to the GAL1 promoter, and GAL1 expression also becomes dependent on both chromatin remodeling enzymes. We propose that SWI/SNF and Gcn5p are globally required for mitotic gene expression due to the condensed state of mitotic chromatin."

TGFβ stimulates the gene coding for human α2(I)-collagen (COL1A2) by inducing binding of an Sp1-containing complex to an upstream promoter element (TGFβ responsive element or TbRE) that contains a CAGA box. Here we report that the CAGA box of the TbRE is the binding site of the Smad3/Smad4 complex, and that the binding of the complex is required for TGFβ-induced COL1A2 up-regulation. Recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 bind in vitro to the CAGA box of COL1A2; TGFβ treatment of cultured fibroblasts induces Smad3/Smad4 binding to the TbRE; transient overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 in fibroblasts transactivates TbRE-driven transcription; and COL1A2 gene up-regulation by TGFβ is abolished in cells stably transfected with plasmids that express dominant negative forms of Smad3 or Smad4.

The analysis also emphasized the requirement of both Sp1- and Smad-binding sites for optimal promoter transactivation. In cells stably transfected with a plasmid expressing a dominant negative form of Sp1, the synergy was shown to be promoter-specific and dependent on the binding of Sp1 to the TbRE.

Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991: 419-462Crossref Google Scholar). The balance between deposition and degradation of the ECM is also a critical aspect of wound healing, tissue repair, and homeostasis (1Hay E.D. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991: 419-462Crossref Google Scholar). It follows that deregulated ECM remodeling is the pathological hallmark of numerous fibrotic and degenerative conditions (2Diegelmann R.F. Lindblad W.J. Cohen I. Nimni E.M. Collagen. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 113-131Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ) is a key regulator of ECM assembly and remodeling (2Diegelmann R.F. Lindblad W.J. Cohen I. Nimni E.M. Collagen. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 113-131Google Scholar, 3Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 4Slack J.L. Liska D.J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This action is exerted through two complementary pathways, one which reduces matrix degradation and the other which stimulates matrix accumulation (2Diegelmann R.F. Lindblad W.J. Cohen I. Nimni E.M. Collagen. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 113-131Google Scholar, 3Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 4Slack J.L. Liska D.J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In mechanistic terms, TGFβ inhibits the synthesis of extracellular proteinases while up-regulating the production of their inhibitors and structural ECM components (2Diegelmann R.F. Lindblad W.J. Cohen I. Nimni E.M. Collagen. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 113-131Google Scholar, 3Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 4Slack J.L. Liska D.J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The combined action of TGFβ on the genes implicated in the formation and degradation of the ECM is mostly exerted at the transcriptional level through ill defined intracellular pathways. Elucidating the molecular nature of these pathways is therefore relevant to the understanding of morphogenesis, homeostasis, and tissue repair, as well as of a wide variety of pathologies. The genes coding for the plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 (PAI-1) and for the α2 chain of type I collagen (COL1A2) are thus far the best characterized experimental models to study the intracellular pathway responsible for TGFβ stimulation of ECM accumulation (5Westerhausen D.R. Hopkins W.E. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1092-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kähäri V.M. Chen Q.Y. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 86: 1489-1495Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is the major structural component of the ECM and consequently, the main contributor to connective tissue physiology and pathology (4Slack J.L. Liska D.J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 1814-1823Crossref Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Indirect lines of evidence have established a causal relationship between TGFβ activity and type I collagen production. First, expression of the type I collagen genes correlates with the extracellular distribution of TGFβ during mouse embryogenesis (8Niederreither K. D'Souza R.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, levels of TGFβ and type I collagen are elevated in activated cells from patients with fibrotic diseases (9Broekelmann T.J. Limper A.H. Colby T.V. McDonald J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Third, TGFβ stimulates type I collagen mRNA accumulation in cultured cells, independently of de novo protein synthesis (10Ignotz R.A. Endo T. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6443-6446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, TGFβ activates transcription of type I collagen promoter/reporter constructs in transient transfection assays (6Kähäri V.M. Chen Q.Y. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 86: 1489-1495Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Using a combination of cell transfection and protein DNA binding assays, we have located the TGFβ-responsive element (TbRE) of the human COL1A2 gene between nucleotides 313 and 250, relative to the start site of transcription (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TbRE sequence consists of two nearly juxtaposed footprints (boxes 3A and B), the most distal of which represents the 3′ half of a larger footprinted area (box A) (Fig. 1). The analyses have also demonstrated that binding of the ubiquitous activator Sp1 to box 3A (−313/−286) is required for TbRE activity (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) has documented that TGFβ treatment of cultured fibroblasts translates into increased intensity of the TbRE-bound complex (TbRC) (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TGFβ-induced increase appears to involve Sp1 co-factor(s) since it is not observed when only box 3A is used as a probe in the EMSA (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At variance with our data, other investigators have reported that CTF/NF-I or AP1, and not Sp1, mediate TGFβ stimulation of the mouse or human COL1A2 promoter (13Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). As a result of this controversy, the intracellular pathway that mediate TGFβ induction of ECM accumulation remains undefined.Figure 1Schematic representation of the TbRE. The −340 to −235 nucleotide sequence of the COL1A2 gene is shown along the with the location of boxes A, 3A, and B. The boundaries of the TbRE and the Sp1-, Smad-, and C/EBP-binding sites are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Smad proteins have emerged as essential components of the TGFβ signaling pathways (15Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). They are generally divided into pathway-restricted (Smads 1–3, 5, 8, and 9), common mediator (Smad4) and inhibitory (Smads 6 and 7) Smads (15Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar, 16Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 17Raftery L.A. Sutherland D.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad3 are specific mediators of the TGFβ and activin pathways (15Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar, 16Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 17Raftery L.A. Sutherland D.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 19Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). TGFβ binds to the type II receptor and this in turn leads to interaction with and phosphorylation of the type I receptor, and activation of its kinase activity. The ligand-bound transmembrane receptor complex then activates the Smad2 or Smad3 proteins which form alternative hetero-oligomers with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus (15Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting Smad complexes can regulate transcription by binding directly to defined DNA sequence complexes or without binding directly to DNA (16Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 19Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cooperativity between Smad complexes and other transcription factors at distinct DNA-binding sites has been identified within several TGFβ-responsive elements as well (20Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar, 21Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comer A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Song C.Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 24Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The modular arrangement of distinct DNA-binding sites within a given TGFβ-responsive element is therefore believed to direct binding specificity, as well as cooperativity between other transcription factors and Smad complexes (15Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has linked TGFβ inducibility of the PAI-1 gene to the binding of Smad3/Smad4 to cis-acting elements that contain the sequence AG(G/A)CAGACA, a.k.a.: CAGA box (20Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The authors of that report also noted that single or multiple CAGA boxes are present in the TGFβ-responsive elements of several other genes, including COL1A2, thus raising the possibility that the Smad3-Smad4 complex might be the common mediator of the TGFβ signaling for ECM accumulation (20Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The putative Smad-binding site (ATGCAGACA) of COL1A2 lies within box B (−271/−250) immediately 3′ of the Sp1 recognition sequence (Fig. 1); consequently, a Smad complex may represent the alleged Sp1 co-factor involved in COL1A2 transactivation (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, transient overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 has been recently shown to transactivate the −772 COL1A2 promoter (25Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, this preliminary observation did not link the transactivation to Smad binding to box B, or evaluate the possibility of a functional interaction between the Smads and Sp1 (25Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to further characterize TGFβ up-regulation of COL1A2 and more generally, to increase our understanding of the TGFβ signaling pathway that controls ECM accumulation. To this end, we examined whether the Smad proteins are indeed components of the TbRC and if so, what their functional interaction with Sp1 might be. Our results indicate that Sp1 and Smad3/Smad4 cooperate synergistically in transactivating the COL1A2 promoter after binding to the TbRE. Furthermore, they provide additional evidence for the critical role of Sp1 in constitutive COL1A2 expression, and in integrating the transcriptional responses of the gene to antagonistic cytokines. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Inc. Logan, UT) and antibiotics (penicillin, 50 units/ml, and streptomycin, 50 μg/ml) (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ and TNFα were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) and added at final concentrations of 7.5 and 20 ng/ml, respectively, 8 h after the cells were placed in medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum (26Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Schneider cells were grown in Drosophila Schneider cell medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (27Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression plasmids (pGEX-Smad2 and pGEX-Smad2dMH2) were generous gifts of Dr. P. ten Dijke (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden), or were derived from the pRK5F-Smad3 and pRKF5-Smad4 plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. R. Derynck, University of California in San Francisco) (18Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) by subcloning the inserts into the pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Deletion of the MH2 coding domain of pGEX-Smad3 led to the generation of pGEX-Smad3ΔMH2. Similarly, the inserts of pRK5F-Smad3 and pRKF5-Smad4 were resubcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) along with the Flag-tag sequence at the 3′ end. The pcDNA3.1 vector was also used to subclone the inserts of the dominant negative Smads, pRK5F-Smad3ΔC and pRKF5-Smad4ΔC (generously provided by Dr. R. Derynck) (18Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). To generate the plasmid expressing the dominant negative version of Sp1, the sequence coding for the zinc finger domain of the protein was amplified using specific primers and the pfu Taq polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using as a template the DNA of pSp1778cDNA (a kind gift of Dr. J. Kadonaga, University of California in San Diego) (28Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The inserts from pRK5F-Smad3 and pRKF5-Smad4 were subcloned into the pPac vector to generate pPacSmad3 and pPacSmad4 (27Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pPacSp1 construct was generously provided by Dr. D. A. Brenner (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) (27Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas Sp1mut-LUC was generated from an analogous construct kindly provided by Dr. M. Trojanowska (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston) (29Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) by subcloning the mutant promoter into the pXP (1Hay E.D. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991: 419-462Crossref Google Scholar) vector (30Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). Other promoter reporter gene constructs have been described elsewhere (18Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The −800PAI/LUC construct and the PAI-1 cDNA were kind gifts of Dr. D. Rifkin (New York University School of Medicine) (31Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sp1 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), whereas nuclear factor-specific antibodies and anti-GST antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells of the XL1-Blue bacterial strain were transformed with the expression vectors, grown and induced according to standard protocols (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). After induction, cells were lysed by sonication and 150 μl of gluthathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the supernatant. After 1 h incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking, the beads were collected and washed and the bound proteins were eluted in 300 μl of the manufacturer's recommended buffer. Protein concentration was estimated using a commercial protein detection kit (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were purified from control and TGFβ-treated cells as described previously (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In some EMSAs, 20 ng of recombinant GST fusion proteins were incubated under previously described conditions together with ∼10,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In other EMSAs, the incubation included 0.5 footprint unit of recombinant Sp1 protein or 5 μg of crude nuclear extracts. When appropriate, samples were preincubated for 1 h with antibodies or unlabeled oligonucleotides. DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound material in 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Conditions for the preparation and transfection of plasmids into mammalian and insect cells by the calcium phosphate procedure have been detailed before (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 24–36 h and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% fetal calf serum for 8 h followed by addition of TGFβ for an additional 0.5 or 12 h for nuclear extract preparation or gene expression assays, respectively (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the various reporter genes was measured according to the standard protocol and normalized against co-transfected control plasmids (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); they include the reporter genes luciferase (pSVLUC), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (pSVCAT), and β-galactosidase (HspLacZ) which are under the control of the SV40 (SV) or heat-shock protein promoter. Schneider cells were harvested and processed 3 days after transfections following the published protocol (27Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed multiple times and in duplicate. The statistical value of the data was evaluated by the Mann-WhitneyU test. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the cells for about 3 weeks in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (33Greenwel P. Tanaka S. Penkov D. Zhang W. Olive M. Moll J. Vinson C. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Total RNA purified according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62897) Google Scholar) was used for Northern blot hybridization as probes for α2(I)-collagen, PAI-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Rates of COL1A2 and GAPDH transcription were determined and quantified as described previously (35Greenwel P. Hu W. Kohanski R.A. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6813-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); experiments were performed in triplicate. For Western analysis, cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with the anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a final dilution of 1:2,000, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as per the manufacturer's recommendations. It has been reported that TGFβ stimulates PAI-1 gene transcription through the binding of Smad3/Smad4 hetero-oligomers to three promoter sites containing the so-called CAGA box (20Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The same study also noted that a single CAGA box is present in the TbRE of the COL1A2 promoter, immediately 3′ of the Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 1). Based on this evidence, we tested whether or not the CAGA box in the TbRE is indeed an authentic Smad-binding site. To this end, purified recombinant Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4-GST fusion proteins were incubated with (CAGA)3, an oligonucleotide that contains three copies of the CAGA box of COL1A2. The GST fusion products included the full-length Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 proteins, and truncated versions of Smad2 and Smad3 without MH2 domains. The MH2 domain mediates protein multimerization of activated Smads, in addition to inhibiting DNA binding by the MH1 domain of inactive Smad proteins (21Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comer A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 36Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Deletion of the MH2 domains was therefore required to test the ability of the MH1 domains of Smad2 and Smad3 to bind to (CAGA)3. The EMSA documented that only the samples that contain recombinant Smad4 and truncated Smad3 proteins yield retarded bands which, in addition, are supershifted by the respective antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Competition with the unlabeled (CAGA)3 oligonucleotide, but not an unrelated sequence, further documented the binding specificity (Fig. 2 A). Another EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts purified from untreated and TGFβ-treated fibroblasts in order to confirm the relationship between intracellular activation of Smads and Smad3/Smad4 binding to (CAGA)3. This second EMSA documented the appearance of a new retarded band in the TGFβ-treated sample, whose specificity was documented by the supershift with the anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Incidentally, none of the other bands were affected by the antibodies in the sample without TGFβ treatment (data not shown). Altogether, the results indicated that Smad3 and Smad4, but not Smad2, bind to the CAGA motif of the TbRE, and that the binding is inducible by TGFβ. The next set of EMSAs employed the natural TbRE sequence in place of the multimerized CAGA motif, and recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 proteins with or without recombinant Sp1. Like the previous test, recombinant Smad3 did not contain the MH2 domain. Incubation of the TbRE probe with recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 yielded no visible complex even in the presence of 400 ng of each protein (data not shown). Similarly, recombinant Sp1 alone yielded only a smear suggesting that stabilization of the complex may depend on the presence of all three proteins (Fig. 3 A). Indeed, incubation of the TbRE probe together with recombinant Sp1, Smad3, and Smad4 yielded two retarded bands whose specificity was documented by being affected by the anti-Sp1 and anti-Smad3 antibodies, but not by the anti-Smad4 antibody (Fig. 3 A). This last result is at variance with the observed binding of recombinant Smad4 to the (CAGA)3 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A). One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that binding of Smad3 may be favored over Smad4 when a single CAGA motif is available, and/or in the presence of Sp1 bound to the cognate site in the TbRE. Assuming that this interpretation is correct, the finding would imply that binding of the Smad3-Smad4 complex to the TbRE is mediated by Smad3. To further confirm the combined participation of Smad and Sp1 proteins in the formation of the TbRE-bound complex, we employed nuclear extracts from untreated and TGFβ-treated cells that were transfected with Smad3 and Smad4 expression plasmids. The EMSA revealed that the patterns of nuclear extracts from untreated and TGFβ-treated cells are identical, and that the retarded bands are equally affected by antibodies against the Smad or Sp1 proteins (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, preincubation with anti-Sp1 or anti-Smads antibodies decreased the intensity of the same bands without an apparent supershift (Fi"

To study its protein sequence, we isolated the agglutinin from human parotid saliva. After trypsin digestion, a portion was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), which gave the molecular mass of 14 unique peptides. The remainder of the digest was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography, and the separated peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/post-source decay; the spectra gave the sequences of five peptides. The molecular mass and peptide sequence information showed that salivary agglutinin peptides were identical to sequences in lung (lavage) gp-340, a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein family. Immunoblotting with antibodies that specifically recognized either lung gp-340 or the agglutinin confirmed that the salivary agglutinin was gp-340. Immunoblotting with an antibody specific to the sialyl Lexcarbohydrate epitope detected expression on the salivary but not the lung glycoprotein, possible evidence of different glycoforms. The salivary agglutinin also interacted with Helicobacter pylori, implicated in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease,Streptococcus agalactiae, implicated in neonatal meningitis, and several oral commensal streptococci. These results identify the salivary agglutinin as gp-340 and suggest it binds bacteria that are important determinants of either the oral ecology or systemic diseases.

Several studies have related the levels of agglutinin in saliva to the numbers of S. mutans in dental plaque (19Carlen A. Olsson J. Ramberg P. Arch.

Despite a potentially important role of agglutinin in regulating the composition of the oral flora, very little is known about the chemical nature of the molecule. When isolated from parotid saliva, it behaves as a 5 × 106-Da oligomeric complex that contains a major 440-kDa glycoprotein (20Ericson T. Rundegren J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting experiments show that this protein is recognized by the same mAb that blocks S. mutans adherence and its parotid saliva-induced aggregationin vitro (20Ericson T. Rundegren J. Eur. J.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) shows that the complex contains other proteins, including secretory IgA, and minor, as yet unidentified, components (20Ericson T.

In the absence of additional structural information about the salivary agglutinin, we isolated the glycoprotein and analyzed its peptide portion by using mass spectrometry techniques. The results showed identity with gp-340 discovered in airway secretions by virtue of its affinity for surfactant protein D (31Holmskov U. Lawson P. Teisner B. Tornoe I. Willis A.C. Morgan C. Koch C.

We also obtained additional interesting information about its glycosylation and bacterial binding properties. All chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were obtained from Sigma. Nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, 0.45 μm) were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Human lung gp-340 was purified from a lavage pellet as described (33Tino M.J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognized a synthetic peptide of gp-340 (anti-gp-340-1) and a purified human lung gp-340 (anti-gp-340-3) were prepared as described (31Holmskov U. Lawson P.

A mAb that recognized human purified lung gp-340 (anti-gp-340-2 (Hyb 213–6)) was prepared as described (31Holmskov U. Lawson P. Teisner B. Tornoe I. Willis A.C. Morgan C. Koch C. Reid K.B. J. Biol.

We used two mAbs that specifically reacted with salivary agglutinin: mAb 143 and mAb 303 (34Takano K. Malamud D. Hand A.R. Okajimas Folia Anat. Jpn. 1992; 69: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The latter two antibodies were from Dr. Daniel Malamud (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The anti-sLex mAb was prepared by culturing the hybridoma cell line CSLEX-1, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. The culture supernatant containing the desired mouse IgM was collected after 48 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chains) was purchased from Bio-Rad and DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Goat anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chains) and goat anti-mouse IgM, both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, were purchased from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). High purity trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Fast-stain® (Coomassie Blue) was from Zoion Biotech (Shrewsbury, MA). Brucella agar and yeast extract were from Difco. IsoVitalex, trypticase soy broth, and Columbia-II-agar were from Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems (Cockeysville, MD). Chemiluminescence detection reagents (SuperSignal® substrate) were purchased from Pierce. Human parotid and submandibular/sublingual (SM/SL) salivas were collected as the ductal secretions as described previously (11Gillece-Castro B.L. Prakobphol A. Burlingame A.L. Leffler H. Fisher S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17358-17368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bratt P. Borén T. Strömberg N. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The samples were either used immediately or mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer and stored at −20 °C before the experiment. Parotid and SM/SL saliva samples, purified salivary agglutinin preparations, and purified lung gp-340 were electrophoretically separated on polyacrylamide gels (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207858) Google Scholar). Three types of gels were used. One had a 3% stacking gel and 10% running gel, and the others were gradient gels, either 4–15% or 10–20% (Bio-Rad). Protein bands were visualized by staining with either Fast-stain® or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Four hundred μl of fresh parotid saliva from one donor was concentrated to 25 μl by using a Centricon Plus 20 filter (Millipore, Marlborough, MA) then mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer. The concentrated sample was electrophoretically separated; the stacking gel contained 3% acrylamide, and the running gel contained 10% acrylamide. After electrophoresis, the protein bands were visualized with Fast-stain®. Under these conditions the salivary agglutinin was well separated from other proteins. This allowed excision of the ∼ 350-kDa band. Agglutinin was purified from fresh parotid or SM/SL saliva using published methods (20Ericson T. Rundegren J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Oho T., Yu, H. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, S. mutans strain Ingbritt was maintained as described below. The cultures were harvested in exponential phase, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, 0.15m NaCl), pH 6.8, and suspended at a concentration of 5 × 109 cells/ml. Equal volumes (100 ml) of bacterial suspension and parotid or SM/SL saliva (diluted 1:1 in PBS, pH 6.8) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The aggregated bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. After the supernatant was discarded, agglutinin was released by adding 6 ml of 20 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 6.8, at room temperature. Then the sample was centrifuged (30,000 ×g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The EDTA extraction and centrifugation steps were repeated once. The two supernatants were pooled and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which was eluted with 10 mmPBS, pH 6.8. The agglutinin-containing void volume (40 ml) was concentrated to a final volume of 600 μl by using Centriprep-10 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The protein concentration was estimated by using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay with bovine albumin as a standard. The void volume fraction was also analyzed by gradient SDS-PAGE (4–15% acrylamide). The excised agglutinin band was macerated in a solution of high purity trypsin (0.05 μg/μl in 25 mmammonium bicarbonate). The proteolytic digestion was allowed to continue at 37 °C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were eluted from the gel with a solution of 50% acetonitrile and 5% trifluoroacetic acid in distilled water and concentrated in a SpeedVac. First, the eluate was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Portions of unseparated tryptic digests were cocrystallized in a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and analyzed by using a PerSeptive Biosystems DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with delayed extraction operated in the reflector mode. Alternatively, peptide samples were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation before mass spectrometry. The apparatus was fitted with a Michrom Bioresources MagicMS C18 column (0.2 × 50 mm; 5-μm particle size; 200 Å pore size) that was equilibrated with 7% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. A flow rate of 1 μl/min was established by using an Eldex Micropro pump. Peptides were eluted isocratically for 10 min followed by a linear gradient (0.875%/min) to a final mobile phase composition of 63% acetonitrile, 0.082% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. 1–2-μl HPLC fractions were spotted directly onto a MALDI target with 1.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Post-source decay (PSD) sequencing was done as described previously (37Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). MS/MS sequencing was by quadrapole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The peptide mass and peptide fragment-ion data were used with the MS-Fit and MS-Tag programs, which are available on the Internet to search data bases to determine peptide identity. The analyses were performed essentially as described previously (38Spahr H. Beve J. Larsson T. Bergstrom J. Karlsson K.A. Gustafsson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1351-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). First, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A single band was visible near the origin of the gel. This band was excised and digested with trypsin. The peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a TofSpec E instrument (Micromass) with delayed extraction and in reflectron mode using a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. For MS/MS, the sample was analyzed on a quadrapole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrument (Micromass), and the m/z 1459 ion was selected for fragmentation analysis. The results were used to search sequence data bases using the MS-Fit and MS-Tag programs as described above. After SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P membranes as described previously (39Prakobphol A. Leffler H. Fisher S.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating blots for 1 h in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% Carnation nonfat dried milk (T-blotto). The blot was then incubated for 2 h with 1 of 5 antibodies that specifically recognized either gp-340 or salivary agglutinin. Anti-gp-340-1 was raised against a synthetic peptide that corresponds to a region of gp-340 (33Tino M.J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Anti-gp-340-2 and anti-gp-340-3 were raised against a gp-340 preparation purified from lung (31Holmskov U. Lawson P. Teisner B.

A. 1999; 96: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). mAbs 143 and 303 were raised against a salivary agglutinin preparation purified from saliva. An earlier study showed that mAb 143 recognizes the agglutinin protein core, whereas mAb 303 recognizes the Ley epitope in the context of the agglutinin protein core (34Takano K. Malamud D. Hand A.R. Okajimas Folia Anat. Jpn. 1992; 69: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All the antibodies were diluted in T-blotto (v:v) as indicated: anti-gp-340-1, 1:1,000; anti-gp 340-2, 1:10,000; anti-gp-340-3, 1:2,000; mAb143, 1:60,000; and mAb303, 1:60,000. The blots were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min each time. Binding of primary polyclonal antibodies was detected after incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:2,000 (v:v) in T-blotto. Binding of mAbs was detected after incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:2,000 (v:v) in T-blotto. After washing, bands were detected either by staining the blots with 3,3′-aminobenzidine (6 mg in 100 ml of PBS containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide) or chemiluminescence detection reagents (SuperSignal®Substrate). Proteins that carried the sLex determinant were identified by staining nitrocellulose transfers with mouse monoclonal anti-sLex IgM (diluted 1:5 (v:v) in T-blotto) essentially as described above. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, isotype-specific secondary antibody used for detection of the IgM was diluted 1:2,000 (v:v) in T-blotto. The origin of S. mutans strain Ingbritt was as described previously (24Carlen A. Bratt P. Stenudd C. Olsson J. Strömberg N. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All other streptococcal strains (see Table II) were from Dr. Mogens Kilian (Aarhus University, Denmark). The streptococcal cells were grown as described previously (24Carlen A. Bratt P. Stenudd C. Olsson J. Strömberg N. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cultures were harvested at exponential phase, washed two times in PBS, and suspended at a concentration of either 2 × 109 or 5 × 109 cells/ml in PBS, pH 6.8. Helicobacter pylori strain CCUG17875 was grown as described previously (40Ilver D. Arnqvist A. Ögren J. Frick I.M. Kersulyte D. Incecik E.T. Berg D.E. Covacci A. Engstrand L. Borén T.

Open table in a new tab The affinity-purified salivary agglutinin sample was incubated with a bacterial cell suspension, and aggregation was recorded by measuring, at 1-min intervals for 1 h, the A700 using a spectrophotometer. The ability of affinity-purified parotid agglutinin to agglutinate a panel of streptococci (Table II) and H. pylori strain CCUG17875 was assessed as described earlier (20Ericson T. Rundegren J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of purified agglutinin (∼2 μg/ml) in PBS, pH 6.8, was mixed with 1 ml of bacteria suspended at a concentration of 5 × 109cells/ml in PBS, pH 6.8. Aggregation was recorded by measuring, at 1-min intervals for 1 h, the A700 using a Beckman® DU-50 series spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). 4 ml of either anH. pylori strain CCUG17875 or an S. mutansIngbritt cell suspension (2 × 109 cells/ml PBS) was incubated with an equal volume of fresh parotid saliva diluted 1:1 in PBS (experimental) or PBS alone (control). Binding took place at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in 150 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After 30 min, the cells were pelleted. An aliquot of the supernatant (∼25 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-gp-340-1 as described above. The salivary agglutinin was isolated by two methods. The first was biochemical. Whole parotid saliva was electrophoretically separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the band corresponding to the molecular mass of the salivary agglutinin was excised (Fig. 1 A, arrowhead). The second method exploited the known biological properties of the molecule. Specifically, the glycoprotein was purified by selective adsorption from whole parotid saliva to S. mutans bacteria followed by release of bound proteins with EDTA-containing buffer and then fractionation of the released proteins on a Superdex 200 column. SDS-PAGE of the void volume fraction showed only a single band of ∼350 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1 B, lane 1, arrowhead), which had a slightly lower molecular mass under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Finally, we also purified agglutinin from SM/SL saliva by selective adsorption to S. mutans cells. SDS-PAGE of the SM/SL agglutinin showed a single band with the same electrophoretic properties as the parotid agglutinin under both nonreducing (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) and reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Initially, both agglutinin preparations were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. An aliquot of each unseparated digest was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, which yielded a peptide mass fingerprint. A total of 15 peptides and 14 unique sequences was obtained from the biochemically purified sample (TableI). The sequence of five of these peptides was determined by MALDI-TOF/PSD (bold italic typeface in TableI). As an example, the MALDI-TOF spectrum of one of the digests is shown in Fig. 2 A. A PSD spectrum and fragmentation of the peptide m/z1459.8 is shown in Fig. 2 B together with the interpretation and deduced amino acid sequence. The peptide mass fingerprint and PSD fragment ions (Table I) were used for data base searching. The results showed that the peptides were identical to regions found within both gp-340 and its splice variant DMBT1, both members of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein family.Table ISummary of MS analyses of tryptic peptides from salivary agglutininPeptide sequenceStart–end 1-aPosition of the amino acid residue in the deduced peptide sequence of gp-340.Monoisotopic mass ± 0.05 Dagp-340 domainVEVLYR247–252, 376–381, 507–512, 615–620, 746–751, 875–880, 1135–1140, 1264–1269, 1393–1398, 1653–1658778.4SRCR2, SRCR3, SDSR4, SRCR5, SRCR6, SDCR7, SRCR9, SRCR10, SRCR11, SRCR13VEILYR115–120792.5SRCR1MTIHFR1855–1860804.4CUB1FPSVYLR2353–2359881.5ZPAFHFLNR2346–2352904.5ZPGRVEVLYR245–252, 1651–1658991.6SRCR2, SRCR13FISDHSITR2099–21071075.6CUB2qIFTSSYNR 1-bq, pyro-glutamic acid.1846–18541098.5CUB1QIFTSSYNR 1-cPeptide masses that were also detected in the affinity-purified agglutinin sample.1846–18541115.5CUB1GSFTSSSNFMSIR2086–20981420.7CUB2DDTYGPYSSPSLR2326–23381457.7ZPFGQGSGPIVLDDVR 1-cPeptide masses that were also detected in the affinity-purified agglutinin sample.418–431, 549–562, 657–670, 788–801, 917–930, 1048–1061, 117"
https://openalex.org/W1967288647,"TFIIH is a multiprotein complex required for both transcription and DNA repair. Single particles of human TFIIH were revealed by electron microscopy and image processing at a resolution of 3.8 nm. TFIIH is 16 x 12.5 x 7.5 nm in size and is organized into a ring-like structure from which a large protein domain protrudes out. A subcomplex assembled from five recombinant core subunits also forms a circular architecture that can be superimposed on the ring found in human TFIIH. Immunolabeling experiments localize several subunits: p44, within the ring structure, forms the base of the protruding protein density which includes the cdk7 kinase, cyclin H, and MAT1. Within the ring structure, p44 was flanked on either side by the XPB and XPD helicases. These observations provide us with a quartenary organizational model of TFIIH."
https://openalex.org/W2135130294,"Kv voltage-gated potassium channels share a cytoplasmic assembly domain, T1. Recent mutagenesis of two T1 C-terminal loop residues implicates T1 in channel gating. However, structural alterations of these mutants leave open the question concerning direct involvement of T1 in gating. We find in mammalian Kv1.2 that gating depends critically on residues at complementary T1 surfaces in an unusually polar interface. An isosteric mutation in this interface causes surprisingly little structural alteration while stabilizing the closed channel and increasing the stability of T1 tetramers. Replacing T1 with a tetrameric coiled-coil destabilizes the closed channel. Together, these data suggest that structural changes involving the buried polar T1 surfaces play a key role in the conformational changes leading to channel opening."

FabI is a distant member of an extended superfamily of proteins termed the short-chain alcohol reductases/dehydrogenases (7Baker M.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1029-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Members of this family are small (∼30 kDa) proteins with ∼20–30% overall identity and utilize nicotinamide cofactors (7Baker M.E.

Most short-chain alcohol reductases/dehydrogenases contain a conserved catalytic triad of Ser-Xaa10-Tyr-Xaa4-Lys (9Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D.

FabI is an atypical short-chain alcohol reductase/dehydrogenase in that the key residues are a diad consisting of the motif Tyr-Xaa6-Lys (7Baker M.E. Biochem.

The hydroxyl of triclosan forms a strong hydrogen bond with the catalytic Tyr156 and the 2′-hydroxyl of NAD+; the hydroxychlorophenyl ring stacks with the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor; and the 4′-chlorine accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of Ala95. A key feature of the interaction is that there is a conformational change in the protein that brings the hydrophobic residues Ile200 and Phe203 in the flexible substrate-binding loop close enough to the drug to form additional van der Waals interactions, further stabilizing the complex. Mutations in the active site of FabI that lead to triclosan resistance sterically interfere with the ability of the drug to optimally interact with the protein and cofactor (11Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T.

The genome ofBacillus subtilis also contains a gene with very high similarity to the E. coli and S. aureus FabI proteins. We cloned this open reading frame (yjbW, B. subtilis fabI) to determine if the NADPH cofactor preference was a common feature of Gram-positive enoyl-ACP reductases. Furthermore, S. aureus and B. subtilis display a 10-fold difference in their susceptibilities to triclosan, and we wished to establish if this difference in drug sensitivity was an intrinsic property of the FabI proteins. We also discovered a new gene that encodes an NADPH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase. This unique protein product is termed FabL, and its expression confers triclosan resistance to type II fatty-acid synthases. trans-2-Enoyl-NAC derivatives were the generous gift of Rocco Gogliotti and John Domagala (Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research). Sigma supplied ACP, NADH, NAD+, NADPH, NADP+, and crotonoyl-CoA. Triclosan (2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether) was the gift of KIC Chemicals (Aramonk, NJ). [2-14C]Malonyl-CoA (specific activity of 55 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of the highest available quality. The entire predicted open reading frame (yjbW, GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number Z99110) for the B. subtilis fabIgene was amplified from genomic DNA using primers bs-xho (5′-CTCGAGATGTCTTTATTAAATATAGGAGGC) and bs-bam (5′-GGATCCTGCTTAGCGGGCAGTGATATGGAA) and cloned into theXhoI and BamHI sites of the pET-15b vector (Novagen). The resultant plasmid, pET-YjbW, was then digested withNdeI and religated to remove the coding region for the first 11 residues of non-homologous sequences and to fuse the His tag to the proposed initiator methionine (Met12 of accession number Z99110). This plasmid, pETbsFabI, expresses the predicted bsFabI protein with an NH2-terminal His tag. The ygaAopen reading frame was amplified from B. subtilischromosomal DNA with primers ygaa-nde (5′-CCATATGGAACAAAATAAATGTGCACTCGTAAC) and ygaa-bam (5′-GGATCCTTAAACGAGCAGTGAGCGTCCGCCGTC). The gene fragment was cloned, using NdeI and BamHI, into pET-15b to form pAN9. Plasmids pET-YjbW, pETbsFabI, and pAN9 were each transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and the proteins were expressed and purified by Ni2+ chelation chromatography as described previously (3Heath R.J.

Next, 95 μl of a cell suspension (5 × 104 cells/ml) in LB medium was added to the plates, which were incubated for 48 h.

Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Briefly, two sets of oligonucleotide primers were designed to PCR-amplify ∼1 kilobase of sequence immediately upstream and downstream of the target gene (see Table I). PCR amplification was carried out using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two primers, B/C, anneal to just outside of the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the target gene's coding sequence and catalyze DNA polymerization away from the target gene in PCR. The remaining primers in each set, A/D, anneal to ∼1 kilobase upstream and downstream of primers B/C, respectively, and allow polymerization toward the target gene. In initial PCRs with strain PY79 genomic DNA as the template, products are formed using the A/B and C/D primer combinations. Because primers B/C also contain “tails” that anneal to a variety of antibiotic resistance cassettes (see below), the A/B and C/D PCR products can be used as primers in a secondary PCR with an antibiotic resistance cassette. The resulting second PCR product thus encodes sequence upstream of the target gene, an antibiotic resistance gene in place of the target gene, and sequence downstream of the target gene. These PCR products were used to transform B. subtilis strain PY79 to antibiotic resistance by standard techniques (25Cutting S.M. Vander Horn P.B. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 67Google Scholar). Nonessential genes can be replaced in this way with the antibiotic resistance marker by double crossover recombination. Typical transformations yielded at least 20 antibiotic-resistant colonies. The genotypes of transformants were verified by PCR of genomic DNA from candidate clones.Table ISequences of PCR primers used in the construction of the B. subtilis knockout strainsPrimer namePrimer sequences (5′ → 3′)Cm-UpCACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTAAACTAAAGCACCCATTAGTTCACm-DnCATTCAAATACAGATGCATTTTATTTCCTCATATTATAAAAGCCAGTCATTSpc-UpCATTCAAATACAGATGCATTTTATTTCCCATTTTTTCAATTTTTTTATAATTTTTTTAATCSpc-DnCACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTAGGCGAATGGCGATTTTCGTTCGYgaA-ACGTCGGCCCTTATACAAAGYgaA-BTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTGTCTTCCTGTTACGAGTGCACATYgaA-CGAAATAAAATGCATCTGTATTTGAATGTAATGACCGTGGAGGTGATAYgaA-DCAGATTGCGGGCTCTCTYrpB-ACCAGGCCATCATTCTCAATAAYrpB-BTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTGTCCATACCGAATCCTCCCGTTAAYrpB-CGAAATAAAATGCATCTGTATTTGAATGTAGGCGCACCTCATTGATAGAYrpB-DGAGCCCGATCCTTTACCAAGYjbW-AAAACGAGCGGTCAGAAGTYjbW-BTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTGTGAAAAGCGCATACCGTAGCYjbW-CGAAATAAAATGCATCTGTATTTGAATGYjbW-DGAAATGTCGGCGAACTC Open table in a new tab Antibiotic resistance cassettes were synthesized in PCRs using universally “tailed” primers and the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). These 5′- and 3′-tails are complementary to the tails of primers B and C, respectively, and allow the AB and CD PCR products to act as primers for amplification of the cassette. Two different cassettes were used: spectinomycin resistance (the spc gene, GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number U46203) and chloramphenicol resistance (cat, accession number V01277). Spectinomycin was used at 150 μg/ml and chloramphenicol at 5 μg/ml (both from Sigma) in LB medium. A BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar) using the ecFabI sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number P29132) as the bait revealed an open reading frame (yjbW, GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number Z99110) that was predicted to encode a FabI homolog (bsFabI). The predicted protein product was 51% identical to FabI fromE. coli and 48% identical to FabI from the Gram-positiveS. aureus (20Heath R.J. Li J. Roland G.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two potential start codons were present in yjbW, the second of which (encoding Met12 of the predicted YjbW protein) aligned with that of other FabI proteins (Fig. 1). The open reading frame encoding both the long and shorter (first 11 codons deleted) versions of the protein were fused to the pET-15b vector for expression as NH2-terminal 6-His-tagged proteins, which were purified to homogeneity by metal chelation affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The two proteins had identical activities in the spectrophotometric assay with 8:1-NAC as substrate (specific activities of 0.08 and 0.14 ± 0.004 nmol/min/μg for the long and short versions, respectively), and we have utilized the short version of the protein for our studies on bsFabI. The second highest score to ecFabI in the B. subtilis genome was an open reading frame termed ygaA(GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number Z82044). The predicted YgaA protein displayed 25% identity to ecFabI (Fig. 1), which is too low to classify it as a FabI homolog. For example, short-chain alcohol reductase/dehydrogenase family members that carry out the unrelated reactions such as reduction of a keto group (E. coli 7-α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AE000257) and β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG; GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AE000210)) were 28 and 24% identical, respectively, to ecFabI. However, YgaA possessed a Tyr-Xaa6-Lys motif, suggesting that it may be an enoyl reductase rather than a short-chain alcohol reductase/dehydrogenase. FabI also contains a flexible substrate-binding loop delimited by two prolines, one of which was present in YgaA (Fig. 1). Based on these similarities to FabI, we cloned the ygaA gene to determine if it encodes an enoyl-ACP reductase. The protein was expressed and purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both bsFabI and YgaA possessed enoyl reductase activity. The bsFabI protein selectively utilized NADH and was inactive with NADPH (Fig. 2). YgaA, on the other hand, did not utilize NADH and catalyzed the reduction of the 8:1-NAC substrate only in the presence of NADPH. The apparent Km value of bsFabI for NADH was 7 μm, whereas YgaA had aKm of 16 μm for NADPH. Neither protein exhibited the cooperative binding characteristic of S. aureus FabI for NADPH (20Heath R.J. Li J. Roland G.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The proteins were further characterized by measuring their specific activities with the 8:1-NAC substrate (Fig. 3 A). The bsFabI and YgaA proteins had activities of 0.14 ± 0.004 and 0.18 ± 0.01 nmol/min/μg, respectively. Under identical assay conditions, ecFabI was more active (1.02 ± 0.006 nmol/min/μg). These data establish that both bsFabI and YgaA are enoyl reductases.Figure 3Specific activity of the enoyl-ACP reductases. The ecFabI (○), bsFabI (●), and FabL (YgaA) (▪) proteins were assayed spectrophotometrically with the substrate analog 8:1-NAC (A) or in a coupled assay system with the physiological substrate 4:1-ACP (B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intermediates in fatty acid biosynthesis are carried in the cell as thioesters of ACP. The 8:1-NAC is thus an analog of the true substrate for FabI, and so we also tested the ability of the bsFabI and YgaA proteins to reduce a trans-2-enoyl-ACP. 4:1-ACP was generated in situ by incubating purified E. colienzymes of fatty acid synthesis with acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, E. coli ACP, and cofactors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enoyl reductase protein was added to initiate the reaction, and the products were separated by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis. Using these assay conditions (Fig. 3 B), bsFabI was as active as ecFabI (2.3 ± 0.4 and 2.9 ± 0.6 nmol/min/μg), whereas the YgaA protein was somewhat less active (0.3 ± 0.02 nmol/min/μg). These data clearly demonstrate that both bsFabI and YgaA have enoyl-ACP reductase activity. We next determined whether bsFabI and YgaA are inhibited by triclosan, a drug known to target ecFabI (11Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Initial rate measurements showed that bsFabI was ∼8-fold more resistant to triclosan than ecFabI (IC50 = 16 and 2 μm, respectively) (Fig. 4). bsFabI contains an Ala at the position equivalent to Gly93in E. coli (Fig. 1), and substitutions at this position are known to increase resistance to this inhibitor due to steric interference with drug binding in the substrate pocket (11Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T.

YgaA also contains an Ala at a position equivalent to Gly93 in ecFabI (Fig. 1) and exhibited the same IC50 (16 μm) as bsFabI (Fig. 4). The key to the effectiveness of triclosan as an antibacterial agent lies in its ability to form a stable ternary complex with the protein and the oxidized cofactor (13Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether this complex forms with bsFabI and YgaA proteins. First, we monitored the consumption of the cofactor over an extended time course using drug concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of the initial rate and initiated the reaction with the protein (Fig. 5 A). The rate of reaction with bsFabI slowed after several minutes and eventually ceased. This is the behavior of a slow, tight-binding inhibitor (30Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar) and is due to the time-dependent formation of a stable bsFabI·NAD+·triclosan ternary complex. This kinetic pattern is the same as observed previously for ecFabI and S. aureus FabI (13Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 20Heath R.J. Li J. Roland G.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Time-dependent complex formation was not observed with YgaA, although the reaction proceeded at a reduced rate (compared with the uninhibited control) until all of the substrate was exhausted (Fig. 5 B). Thus, triclosan behaves as a simple, reversible inhibitor of YgaA. Next, enzyme, drug, and oxidized cofactor were preincubated for 15 min prior to initiating the reaction with substrate. All other factors (enzyme, drug, and substrate concentrations and temperature) were constant. The stable ternary complex formed with the bsFabI enzyme during this preincubation, inactivating the enzyme such that virtually no reaction was observed following addition of substrate (Fig. 5 A). With YgaA, the preincubated sample catalyzed the reaction at the same rate as the reaction initiated with enzyme (Fig. 5 B), confirming the absence of ternary complex formation. Thus, triclosan inhibited bsFabI by the formation of a stable bsFabI·NAD+·drug ternary complex, but was a reversible inhibitor of the YgaA enoyl-ACP reductase. The ability of bsFabI and YgaA to function as enoyl-ACP reductases in vivo was assessed by transforming constitutive expression plasmids into the temperature-sensitive E"

Although the genes responsible for the synthesis of IPS have been identified, the gene(s) for the degradation of IPS has not been reported. Here we show thatISC1 (YER019w), which has homology to bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase), encodes IPS phospholipase C (IPS-PLC). First, we observed that overexpression ofISC1 greatly increased neutral SMase activity, and this activity was dependent on the presence of phosphatidylserine. Cells deleted in ISC1 demonstrated negligible neutral SMase activity. Because yeast cells have IPS instead of SM, we investigated whether IPS are the physiologic substrates of this enzyme. Lysates ofISC1-overexpressing cells demonstrated very high PLC activities on IPS. Deletion of ISC1 eliminated endogenous IPS-PLC activities.

Ceramide has been proposed to be involved in stress responses induced by serum deprivation, heat shock, irradiation, or anticancer drugs.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism have been identified, and the genes involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids such as LCB1/LCB2 are essential for growth (11Dickson R.C.

S. cerevisiae possesses inositol phosphosphingolipids (IPS) (inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide (MIPC), and mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide (M(IP)2C)) as its complement of complex sphingolipids instead of choline phosphorylceramide (SM) and glycosphingolipids of mammals (13Steiner S.

Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AUR1, which encodes IPC synthase, is also essential for the growth of S. cerevisiae, indicating that IPS may play a crucial role in yeast (15Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, the gene(s) involved in degradation of IPS in yeast have not been elucidated. Interestingly, the existence of N-SMase activity in S. cerevisiae was recently reported, although SM does not appear to exist in S. cerevisiae (16Ella K.M. Qi C. Dolan J.W. Thompson R.P. Meier K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that N-SMase activity may be an in vitroactivity of yeast IPS phospholipase C (IPS-PLC). Therefore, we investigated YER019w, a yeast homolog of bacterial N-SMase (7Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), to test this hypothesis. Here we report that YER019w indeed encodes IPS-PLC. We named this gene ISC1 forIPS-PLC. Overexpression ofISC1 in S. cerevisiae dramatically increased N-SMase as well as IPC-, MIPC-, and M(IP)2C-PLC activities. Interestingly, these activities demonstrated a strict requirement for phosphatidylserine (PS) or other acidic phospholipids in the assay. Furthermore, all of these activities were completely eliminated in the deletion mutant cells of ISC1. Radiolabeling experiments showed an increase of M(IP)2C and IPC in the deletion mutant cells. Therefore, these results identify the first enzyme ofS. cerevisiae involved in the catabolism of complex sphingolipids.

Yeast cells were suspended in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. Cells were disrupted with glass beads as described (17Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The activity of N-SMase was examined as described (24Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cell lysates (2–10 μl) were incubated in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 nmol (6.7 mol %) of PS, 2.5 nmol (1.7 mol %) of unlabeled SM, and 100,000 dpm of [choline-methyl-14C]SM at 30 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, 0.8 ml of chloroform, 0.4 ml of methanol, and 0.2 ml of water were added according to the method of Folch et al. (25Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity in a portion (400 μl) of the upper phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting. PLC activities on IPC, MIPC, M(IP)2C, PC, and PI were examined as described for the N-SMase assay using the respective lipids (IPS labeled with [3H]inositol were used) instead of SM. For the separation of phases in assays using IPS, 0.2 ml of 1% perchloric acid was used instead of water. For M(IP)2C, lipid extraction by the method of Folch et al. (25Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was repeated three times. Lyso-PAF-PLC and lyso-PC-PLC activities were determined as described (24Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described (26Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y.

For Western blot analysis, anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:5000 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively. Lysates of ISC1-overexpressing cells were prepared as described above. The lysates were then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), washed with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl), and eluted with 0.1 mglycine (pH 3.5). The eluate was immediately neutralized with 0.025 volume of 1 m Tris (pH 8.0). Yeast cells (2 × 107) were labeled with 2.5 μm NBD-C6-SM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in SC medium for 1 h. Lipids were extracted by the method of Folchet al. (25Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by TLC with solvent C (chloroform, methanol, and 15 mm CaCl2 (60:35:8)). Yeast cells (1–2 × 107) were labeled with [3H]dihydrosphingosine in SC medium for the indicated times. Lipids were extracted with solvent A, base-hydrolyzed with monomethylamine reagent, and separated by TLC with solvent B. The plate was treated with ENHANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 2 days. The bands for IPS were scraped and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Recently, it was reported that the amino acid sequence of the Isc1p shares slight homology (∼10% identity) with that of bacterial N-SMase (7Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of mouse or human homologs of the Isc1p induced N-SMase activity, although lyso-PAF instead of SM is most likely the in vivo substrate of the human homolog (24Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whereas SM probably does not exist in yeast, a recent report showed N-SMase activity in S. cerevisiae (16Ella K.M. Qi C. Dolan J.W. Thompson R.P. Meier K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether the Isc1p possesses N-SMase activity, pYES2 containing the sequence of ISC1 was constructed and transfected into JK9-3dα, and the expression of ISC1 was induced by SC-Ura medium containing 2% galactose overnight. In initial experiments, N-SMase activity in lysates of vector transfectant orISC1-overexpressing cells was negligible. Because the activity of N-SMase partially purified from rat brain was greatly stimulated by PS or other acidic phospholipids (27Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), PS was added to the N-SMase assay. Surprisingly, the N-SMase activities of both the vector and ISC1-overexpressing cells were greatly increased by PS. Furthermore, the N-SMase activity ofISC1-overexpressing cells was increased by >100-fold compared with that of vector transfectant in the presence of PS (TableI). In the presence of 100 μm (6.7 mol %) PS in the assay, theKm and Vmax for SM were 2.37 mol % and 9.2 nmol/μg/h, respectively (TableII).Table IPLC activities on SM, IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C in lysates of vector transfectant, ISC1-overexpressing cells, and wild-type cells (WT), and deletion mutant of ISC1 (KO)VYWTKOSM0.011 ± 0.0013.699 ± 0.1850.013 ± 0.0010.0007 ± 0.0001IPC0.006 ± 0.0011.402 ± 0.0060.009 ± 0.0020MIPC0.011 ± 0.0025.692 ± 0.0490.023 ± 0.0030M(IP)2C0.018 ± 0.0026.407 ± 0.2960.034 ± 0.0020.0011 ± 0.0011The results are means ± S.D. of triplicate experiments (nanomoles/μg/h).

The overexpressed protein with the FLAG tag was detected at ∼55 kDa by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1 A). When cell lysates were fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, most of the overexpressed protein was detected in the 100,000 ×g pellet (Fig. 1 A). Approximately 60% of N-SMase activity was recovered in the pellet, and <10% was in the supernatant (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the overexpressed protein exists in the membrane fraction. Indeed, analysis of the amino acid sequence of the Isc1p shows that it contains two putative transmembrane domains (7Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To examine whether the Isc1p itself possesses N-SMase activity, the overexpressed protein with a FLAG tag was partially purified using anti-FLAG affinity gel. One single major band at 55 kDa was detected with several minor bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel by silver staining (Fig. 1 B). This 55-kDa protein was detected with anti-FLAG antibody by Western blotting (data not shown). The specific activity of the partially purified protein on SM was 75 nmol/μg/h, which was >10-fold of that of the cell lysates. However, the activity of the partially purified protein was unstable. Approximately 50 and 80% of the activity was lost within 24 and 48 h at 4 °C, respectively. The activity was not preserved at −20 °C or in the presence of glycerol or albumin. Therefore, cell lysates were used in further experiments for the characterization of this enzyme. N-SMase activity in the lysates ofISC1-overexpressing cells was dependent on detergents such as Triton X-100. N-SMase activity was optimal in 0.1% Triton X-100 and was reduced in higher concentrations of Triton X-100 when fixed amounts of PS and SM were used in the assay (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, when fixed mole percents of PS and SM in Triton X-100-mixed micelles were used, N-SMase activity was almost constant between 0.1 and 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that the enzyme is sensitive primarily to the surface concentration of substrate and that Triton X-100 reduced the activity due to dilution of substrate and cofactor. When N-SMase activity was measured in the presence of β-octyl glucoside instead of Triton X-100, N-SMase activity was negligible without PS and was detectable only in the presence of 0.6% β-octyl glucoside with PS (data not shown). N-SMase activity was also dependent on Mg2+ (data not shown). Mn2+ stimulated N-SMase activity at 1 mm; however, higher concentrations of Mn2+ suppressed the activity. Ca2+ did not support N-SMase activity. Dithiothreitol slightly stimulated N-SMase activity (data not shown). SMase activity was maximum at pH 7.5 and greatly reduced at acidic or alkaline pH (data not shown). Since N-SMase activity has been measured in S. cerevisiae, we investigated if the ISC1 gene accounts for this activity. Therefore, a deletion mutant of ISC1 (Δisc1) was generated. N-SMase activity in the deletion mutant was negligible (Table I), suggesting that ISC1 may be the only gene encoding N-SMase activity in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, we measured N-SMase activity in cells. To this end, the cells were labeled with NBD-C6-SM, and lipids were separated by TLC. As shown in Fig. 3, the generation of NBD-C6-ceramide was increased by ∼3-fold inISC1-overexpressing cells compared with vector transfectant. On the other hand, NBD-C6-ceramide was not detected in Δisc1 cells. These results demonstrate that the Isc1p possesses N-SMase activity in cells as well as in vitro and that it is the protein responsible for the basal activity of N-SMase inS. cerevisiae. Because SM is not detectable in S. cerevisiae, and the major complex sphingolipids in S. cerevisiae are the IPS, we suspected that IPS might be substrates for the Isc1p. To examine this,3H-labeled IPS (IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C) were purified from yeast cells and used as substrates instead of SM in the assay. Lysates of ISC1-overexpressing cells showed a greatly increased hydrolytic activity on these lipids (Table I). The in vitro activities on IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C in the overexpressing cells were increased by 230-, 510-, and 360-fold, respectively, compared with those in vector cells. When IPC purified from cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid was used as a substrate, the product corresponded to the standard of (phyto)ceramide on TLC (Fig. 4). Also, when M(IP)2C labeled with [3H]dihydrosphingosine was used as a substrate, the product was (phyto)ceramide (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the activity was of the PLC-type. Next, the Km and Vmax for these lipids were determined (Table II). The Kmvalues for M(IP)2C and MIPC were approximately half of that for IPC, and the Vmax values for M(IP)2C and MIPC were ∼3.4-fold and 2.9- of that for IPC, respectively, suggesting that M(IP)2C and MIPC are better substrates for the Isc1p than IPC, as further shown by comparison of the Vmax/Km ratios. TheKm and Vmax for M(IP)2C and MIPC were almost the same as those for SM (Table II). Furthermore, lysates of the deletion mutant of ISC1 showed negligible activities on IPS (Table I). These results suggest thatISC1 may be the only gene that encodes IPS-PLC activity inS. cerevisiae, at least under these growth conditions. Other phospholipids were also examined as substrates. PLC activity on PC was 0.002 ± 0.001 nmol/μg/h in lysates of both vector transfectant and ISC1-overexpressing cells, suggesting that PC is not a substrate of this enzyme. PLC activity on PI was undetectable in lysates of vector transfectant and not significantly increased in lysates of ISC1-overexpressing cells (0.001 ± 0.001 nmol/μg/h), suggesting that PI is not a substrate. Moreover, the human homolog of bacterial N-SMase demonstrated PLC activities on lyso-PAF and lyso-PC (24Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); therefore, lyso-PAF and lyso-PC were examined as substrates of this enzyme. PLC activity on lyso-PAF was 0.013 ± 0.005 and 0.011 ± 0.016 nmol/μg/h, and PLC activity on lyso-PC was 0.001 ± 0.001 and 0.003 ± 0.002 nmol/μg/h in lysates of vector transfectant andISC1-overexpressing cells, respectively. These results suggest that neither lyso-PAF nor lyso-PC is a substrate of this enzyme. To characterize IPS-PLC activities, MIPC was used as a substrate in further experiments. PLC activity on MIPC was dependent on Mg2+, and the Ka for Mg2+was 2.4 mm (Fig. 5 A). Mn2+stimulated the activity at 1 mm; however, the activity was decreased at higher concentrations of Mn2+. Ca2+ did not support the activity. PLC activity on MIPC was maximum at pH 7.5 and greatly reduced at acidic or alkaline pH (Fig. 5 B). As mentioned above, PLC activities on IPS as well as SM were dependent on the presence of PS in the assay. When 0.1% Triton X-100 was used in the assay, 5 μm (0.33 mol %) PS only slightly induced PLC activity on MIPC, and stimulation of the activity was maximum at 100 μm (6.7 mol %) PS (Fig. 6 A). Because the stimulation of the activity by PS was S-shaped, a Hill plot was performed. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the Hill coefficient was ∼2.0, suggesting that two or more molecules of PS interact with the Isc1p to stimulate IPS-PLC activities in a cooperative manner. When various concentrations of PS were used in the assay, a double-reciprocal plot showed that theKm remained constant, whereas theVmax was increased at higher concentrations of PS (Fig. 6, C and D). Other acidic phospholipids such as PI and cardiolipin also stimulated PLC activity on MIPC, but less effectively (Fig. 6 E). Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidic acid only slightly increased the activity (Fig. 6 E). To examine the effect of the Isc1p on IPS metabolism in cells, we performed radiolabeling experiments with [3H]dihydrosphingosine. When wild-type and deletion mutant cells of ISC1 were labeled with [3H]dihydrosphingosine, the levels of M(IP)2C and IPC were increased in the deletion mutant compared with the wild type (the radioactivities were 18,000 and 27,000 dpm for M(IP)2C and 28,000 and 36,000 dpm for IPC in the wild type and deletion mutant, respectively) (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, the level of MIPC was not increased in the deletion mutant compared with the wild type. These data demonstrate that the Isc1p functions as IPS-PLC in cells. On the other hand, when vector transfectant andISC1-overexpressing cells were labeled with [3H]dihydrosphingosine, the levels of IPS were not apparently decreased in ISC1-overexpressing cells compared with vector transfectant (Fig. 7 B). Similar results were obtained by labeling the cells with [3H]inositol (data not shown). SM hydrolysis induced by SMases has been reported to be involved in various signal transduction and cell regulatory pathways in mammalian cells. N-SMase activity was also detected in yeast cells, although SM does not exist in yeast (16Ella K.M. Qi C. Dolan J.W. Thompson R.P. Meier K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IPS (IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C) are the major sphingolipids in yeast. Here we demonstrated that ISC1 (YER019W) encodes IPS-PLC in S. cerevisiae. It was previously shown that the Isc1p shares slight homology in amino acid sequence with bacterial N-SMases (7Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspected that it would be a good candidate for a yeast phospholipase that also acts on SM. Indeed, we detected a great increase of N-SMase activity in lysates of ISC1-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, this activity hydrolyzed IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C in vitro. Interestingly, the activity was completely dependent on PS (or other acidic phospholipids such as PI and cardiolipin). N-SMase activity purified from rat brain was also greatly stimulated by PS, although N-SMase activity in crude lysates of rat brain was not much increased by PS (27Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activity of the human homolog of bacterial N-SMases was only slightly (up to 2-fold) stimulated by PS, 2H. Sawai, and Y. A. Hannun, unpublished observations. although the amino acid sequence of this protein shows ∼30% homology to that of the Isc1p. The Hill coefficient for PS of the Isc1p was ∼2.0, suggesting that two or more molecules of PS interact cooperatively with the Isc1p to stimulate its activity. The precise mechanism by which PS stimulates IPS-PLC activity awaits the elucidation of PS-binding sites in the protein. It also remains to be elucidated whether PS (or other acidic phospholipids) functions as an activating factor of IPS-PLC in cells. Colocalization of the protein and PS (or other phospholipids) may be critical for the activation of IPS-PLC, and IPS-PLC activity may be induced by the increase in lipid cofactor upon cell stimulation. The deletion mutant of ISC1 almost completely lost PLC activities for all IPS (IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C), indicating that ISC1 is the only gene encoding IPS-PLC activities inS. cerevisiae. This result is in contrast with the fact that distinct genes encode the enzymatic activities for the synthesis of IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C and is distinct from the fact that mammalian cells have more than one SMase. The PLC activity of the Isc1p was specific to IPS and SM because PLC activity on PC, lyso-PC, or PI was much lower than that on IPS in lysates ofISC1-overexpressing cells. Lyso-PAF was not a substrate for the Isc1p, although the human homolog of the Isc1p showed high activity on lyso-PAF both in vitro and in cells (24Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mammalian homolog of the Isc1p acquired another function (i.e. lyso-PAF-PLC activity) during the evolutionary process from yeast to mammals. It is also possible that another mammalian homolog of the Isc1p exists with specific activity for SM depending on PS as a cofactor. Although cell labeling experiments showed increased levels of M(IP)2C and IPC, the level of MIPC was not increased in the deletion mutant of ISC1 compared with wild-type cells, and the levels of IPS were not apparently decreased inISC1-overexpressing cells compared with vector transfectant. These results would be explained by different possibilities. First, this would be explained by counter-regulatory metabolic changes such that enzymes involved in de novo synthesis of IPS may be influenced by the deletion or overexpression of ISC1 to compensate for the change in IPS-PLC activity. Second, the overexpressed Isc1p may not exert full activity due to the limitation of key activator(s) in cells. In accordance with this notion, the results obtained by labeling the cells with NBD-C6-SM showed only a 3-fold increase in NBD-C6-ceramide, whereas N-SMase activity was increased >100-fold in vitro inISC1-overexpressing cells compared with vector transfectant. Finally, the overexpressed Isc1p may not have access to most of its substrates due to distinct localization because most IPS exist in the plasma membrane (28Patton J.L. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it is highly possible that the Isc1p exists in the endoplasmic reticulum judging from the fact that the Isc1p shares high homology in the putative transmembrane domains with its mouse homolog, which was recently shown to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (29Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This may explain why the levels of IPS were not decreased in ISC1-overexpressing cells compared with vector transfectant. However, the localization of the Isc1p remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, this study identifies the yeast IPS-PLC as the first and possibly only enzyme involved in the catabolism of yeast complex sphingolipids.

Strikingly, TatCd is of major importance for the secretion of PhoD, whereas TatCy is not required for this process. Thus, TatC appears to be a specificity determinant for protein secretion via the Tat pathway.

Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with components of the protein secretion pathways ofB. subtilis, these native secreted proteins form the so-called secretome (2Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D.H. Bron S. van Dijl J.M.

The results of this analysis indicated that ∼300 of the 4107 identified genes specify putative exported proteins with an amino-terminal signal peptide. We previously predicted that 114 of these are lipoproteins, which are retained in the cytoplasmic membrane (4Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S.

A closer examination of the remaining putative secreted proteins suggests that these can be divided into various subgroups on the basis of particular motifs in their signal peptides. 1Jan D. H. Jongbloed, Ulrike Martin, Haike Antelmann, Michael Hecker, Harold Tjalsma, Gerard Venema, Sierd Bron, Jan Maarten van Dijl, and Jörg Müller, unpublished observations. Notably, the signal peptides belonging to one of these subgroups (see TableI) contain a so-called “twin-arginine” motif with the RRXφφ (where φ is a hydrophobic residue) consensus sequence (5Berks B.C.

Even though the Tat pathway was first identified in thylakoids (called the ΔpH pathway in chloroplasts) (12Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol.

In this organism, four genes are known to encode proteins involved in the Tat export pathway. Three of these genes form an operon (tatABC), whereas the tatE gene is monocistronic (see Refs. 9Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T.

The TatABCE proteins are membrane-bound and believed to function in the Tat protein translocase in the plasma membrane. The protein encoded by the fourth gene in the tatABC operon, denoted tatD, was recently shown not to be required for Tat-dependent protein export (15Wexler M. Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R.

Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In contrast, the products of thetatA and tatE genes, which are paralogues of thetatB-encoded protein (19Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 5: 260-274Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar), were shown to have overlapping functions in protein export via the Tat pathway (10Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The precise roles of TatABCE in the recognition of RR signal peptides and the protein translocation process are presently unknown. Notably, a functional Tat pathway is required for anaerobic growth of E. coli, which is due to the fact that various proteins required for anaerobic growth are exported via this pathway (see Refs. 5Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar and19Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 5: 260-274Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Genes specifying homologues of the E. coli TatABE proteins were identified in most bacteria, including B. subtilis (20Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). In contrast to E. coli, which contains only one tatC gene, two genes specifying TatC homologues were identified in B. subtilis (see Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, each of the two tatC genes ofB. subtilis was preceded by a tatABE-like gene. These observations are consistent with the identification of genes for (putative) exported proteins with RR signal peptides in B. subtilis. Strikingly, however, the WapA and WprA proteins, which are synthesized with potential RR signal peptides, were recently shown to be secreted in an Ffh- and SecA-dependent manner (21Hirose I. Sano K. Shioda I. Kumano M. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Microbiology ( Read. ). 2000; 146: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As the transport of proteins via the Tat pathway of E. coliwas shown to be independent of SecA and largely independent of Ffh (22Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), this observation raised the question whether a functional Tat pathway exists in B. subtilis. On the contrary, the observation that B. subtilis contains two paralogoustatC genes, each with an upstream tatA gene, might even suggest that two parallel routes for twin-arginine translocation exist in this organism. This idea was, to some extent, also suggested by the observation that one set of tatACgenes of B. subtilis was preceded by the phoDgene, which specifies a secreted phosphodiesterase (i.e. PhoD) (23Eder S. Shi L. Jensen K. Yamane K. Hulett F.M. Microbiology ( Read. ). 1996; 142: 2041-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with an RR signal peptide (see Table I) and which is expressed only under conditions of phosphate starvation (23Eder S. Shi L. Jensen K. Yamane K. Hulett F.M. Microbiology ( Read. ). 1996; 142: 2041-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the latter tatC gene, denotedtatCd, is expressed only under conditions of phosphate starvation. Moreover, it seems to be specifically required for the secretion of PhoD, a process that was almost completely blocked when the tatCd gene was disrupted, but not when thetatCy gene was disrupted. These observations show that the TatCd protein of B. subtilis is a specificity determinant for Tat-dependent protein secretion. Table IIlists the plasmids and bacterial strains used.

To construct B. subtilis ItatCd, the 5′-region of the tatCd gene was amplified by PCR with primers JJ14bT (5′-CCC AAG CTT ATG AAA GGG AGG GCT TTT TTG AAT GG-3′, containing aHindIII site) and JJ15bT (5′-GCG GAT CCA AAG CTG AGC ACG ATC GG-3′, containing a BamHI site). The amplified fragment was cleaved with HindIII and BamHI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pMutin2 (32Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology ( Read. ). 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), resulting in pMICd1. B. subtilis ItatCd was obtained by a Campbell-type integration (single crossover) of pMICd1 into the tatCdregion of the chromosome. To construct B. subtilis ItatCy, the 5′-region of the tatCy gene was amplified by PCR with primers JJ03iJ (5′-CCC AAG CTT AAA AAG AAA GAA GAT CAG TAA GTT AGG ATG-3′, containing a HindIII site) and JJ04iJ (5′-GCG GAT CCA AGT CCT GAG AAA TCC G-3′, containing a BamHI site). The amplified fragment was cleaved with HindIII and BamHI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pMutin2, resulting in pMICy1. B. subtilis ItatCy was obtained by a Campbell-type integration (single crossover) of pMICy1 into the tatCyregion of the chromosome. To construct B. subtilis ΔtatCd, thetatCd gene was amplified by PCR with primers JJ33Cdd (5′-GGA ATT CGT GGG ACG GCT ACC-3′, containing an EcoRI site and 5′-sequences of tatCd) and JJ34Cdd (5′-CGG GAT CCA TCA TGG GAA GCG-3′, containing a BamHI site and 3′-sequences oftatCd). Next, the PCR-amplified fragment was cleaved withEcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pUC21, resulting in pJCd1. Plasmid pJCd2 was obtained by replacing an internal BclI-AccI fragment of the tatCd gene in pJCd1 with a pDG792-derived kanamycin resistance marker, flanked by BamHI andClaI restriction sites. Finally, B. subtilisΔtatCd was obtained by a double crossover recombination event between the disrupted tatCd gene of pJCd2 and the chromosomal tatCd gene. To construct B. subtilis ΔtatCy, thetatCy gene was amplified by PCR with primers JJ29Cyd (5′-GGG GTA CCG GAA AAC GCT TGA TCA GG-3′, containing a KpnI site and 5′-sequences of tatCy) and JJ30Cyd (5′-CGG GAT CCT TTG GGC GAT AGC C-3′, containing a BamHI site and 3′-sequences of tatCy). Next, the PCR-amplified fragment was cleaved withKpnI and BamHI and ligated into theAsp718 and BamHI sites of pUC21, resulting in pJCy1. Plasmid pJCy2 was obtained by ligating a pDG1726-derived spectinomycin resistance marker, flanked by PstI restriction sites, into the unique PstI site of the tatCygene in pJCy1. Finally, B. subtilis ΔtatCy was obtained by a double crossover recombination event between the disrupted tatCy gene of pJCy2 and the chromosomaltatCy gene. tatCd-tatCy double mutants were constructed by transforming the ΔtatCy mutant with chromosomal DNA of the ΔtatCd or ItatCd mutant strain. Correct integration of plasmids or resistance markers into the chromosome ofB. subtilis was verified by Southern blotting. The BLAST algorithm (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J.

Protein sequence alignments were carried out with the ClustalW program (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) using the Blosum matrices or Version 6.7 of the PCGene Analysis Program (IntelliGenetics Inc.). Putative transmembrane segments and their membrane topologies were predicted with the TopPred2 algorithm (35Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J.

Competence for DNA binding and uptake was determined by transformation with plasmid or chromosomal DNA (37Bron S. Venema G. Mutat. Res. 1972; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The efficiency of sporulation was determined by overnight growth in Schaeffer's sporulation medium, killing of cells with 0.1 volume of chloroform, and subsequent plating. The assay and calculation of β-galactosidase units (expressed as units/A600) were carried out as described (38Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in fresh medium, and samples were taken at hourly intervals for A600 readings and β-galactosidase activity determinations. Induction of the phosphate starvation response was monitored by alkaline phosphatase activity determinations as described (39Hulett F.M. Bookstein C. Jensen K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 735-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect PhoB and PhoD, B. subtilis cells were separated from the growth medium by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 2 min, room temperature). Proteins in the growth medium were concentrated 20-fold upon precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were prepared as described previously (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) as described (41Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). PhoB and PhoD were visualized with specific antibodies (42Müller J.P. Wagner M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. B. subtilis strains were grown at 37 °C under vigorous agitation in 1 liter of a synthetic medium (43Antelmann H. Engelmann S. Schmid R. Sorokin A. Lapidus A. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7251-7256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Antelmann H. Scharf C. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) containing 0.16 mm KH2PO4 to induce a phosphate starvation response. After 1 h of post-exponential growth, cells were separated from the growth medium by centrifugation. The secreted proteins in the growth medium were precipitated overnight with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 2 h, 4 °C). The pellet was washed three times with 96% ethanol; dried; and resuspended in 400 μl of rehydration solution containing 2 m thiourea, 8m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Pharmalyte (pH 3–10). Cells were disrupted by sonication as described (45Eymann C. Mach H. Harwood C.R. Hecker M. Microbiology ( Read. ). 1996; 142: 3163-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and cellular proteins were resuspended in rehydration solution as described above. Samples of secreted or cellular proteins in rehydration solution were used for the re-swelling of immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3–10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Next, protein separation in the immobilized pH gradient strips (first dimension electrophoresis) was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was performed as described (46Bernhardt J. Völker U. Völker A. Antelmann H. Schmid R. Mach H. Hecker M. Microbiology ( Read. ). 1997; 143: 999-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The resulting two-dimensional gels were stained with silver nitrate (47Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. In-gel tryptic digestion of proteins, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, was performed using a peptide-collecting device (48Otto A. Thiede B. Müller E.C. Scheler C. Wittmann-Liebold B. Jungblut P. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For this purpose, 0.5 μl of peptide solution was mixed with an equal volume of a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting mixture was applied to the sample template of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer (Voyager DE-STR, PerSeptive Biosystems). Peptide mass fingerprints were analyzed using MS-Fit software. To investigate whether B. subtilis contains a potential Tat pathway, a search for homologues of E. coli Tat proteins was performed using the complete sequence of the B. subtilis genome (3Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar). First, sequence comparisons revealed that B. subtiliscontains three paralogous genes (i.e. yczB,ydiI, and ynzA) that specify proteins with sequence similarity to the three paralogous E. coli TatA, TatB, and TatE proteins. Specifically, the YdiI protein (57 residues), which was renamed TatAy, showed the highest degree of sequence similarity to the E. coli TatA protein (58% identical residues and conservative replacements); the YczB protein (70 residues), which was renamed TatAd, showed the highest degree of sequence similarity to the E. coli TatB protein (54% i"
https://openalex.org/W2170146581,"The molecular motor myosin is proposed to bind to actin and swing its light-chain binding region through a large angle to produce an ∼10 nm step in motion coupled to changes in the nucleotide state at the active site. To date, however, direct dynamic measurements have largely failed to show changes of that magnitude. Here, we use a cysteine engineering approach to create a high resolution, FRET-based sensor that reports a large, ∼70 degree nucleotide-dependent angle change of the light-chain binding region. The combination of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements unexpectedly reveals two distinct prestroke states. The measurements also show that bound Mg.ADP.Pi, and not bound Mg.ATP, induces the myosin to adopt the prestroke states."
https://openalex.org/W2057534786,"Apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy. Recent studies showed that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) inhibits apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells and improves myocardial function in experimental heart failure. This study was carried out to elucidate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in the anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I in cardiomyocytes and to explore whether expression of constitutively active PI 3-kinase can inhibit apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Apoptosis of primary cardiomyocytes was induced by doxorubicin treatment and serum withdrawal. Transduction of cardiomyocytes with constitutively active PI 3-kinase specifically lead to serine phosphorylation of Akt, whereas phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor, IRS1/2 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase were not increased. In the cardiomyocytes transduced with constitutively active PI 3-kinase, activation of the pro-apoptotic caspase 3 was attenuated and fragmentation of DNA was reduced. Preincubating cells with PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 was associated with loss of anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I and PI 3-kinase. Neither IGF-I nor constitutively active PI 3-kinase lead to serine phosphorylation of Bad, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic effects of PI 3-kinase are not mediated through Bad phosphorylation in cardiac muscle cells. To determine whether activation of caspase 3 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, an engineered TAT-caspase 3 protein was introduced to cardiomyocytes. Significant reduction of cell viability occurred in the cardiomyocytes transduced with active caspase 3, indicating that activation of caspase 3 is sufficient to cause cardiomyocyte death. These findings indicate the existence of an IGF-I receptor-PI 3-kinase-caspase 3 pathway in cardiomyocytes that plays an important role in the anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I in heart. Moreover, these data suggest that modulation of PI 3-kinase activities may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract the occurrence of apoptosis in cardiomyopathy. Apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy. Recent studies showed that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) inhibits apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells and improves myocardial function in experimental heart failure. This study was carried out to elucidate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in the anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I in cardiomyocytes and to explore whether expression of constitutively active PI 3-kinase can inhibit apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

Because myocytes rarely proliferate in adult cardiac muscles, loss of cardiac muscle cells leads to a permanent loss of cardiac functional units. Thus myocardial apoptosis may contribute to or aggravate the development of myocardial dysfunction in various cardiac diseases.

How these pathways modulate apoptosis signaling in cardiomyocytes is not yet clear. Recent studies have shown that in various types of cells the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-I disappeared when activation of PI 3-kinase was inhibited. Thus it appears that the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-I require activation of PI 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase is composed of an 85-kDa (p85) regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). Activation of PI 3-kinase leads to activation of downstream signaling molecules such as Akt/PKB. How PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling modulates apoptosis signaling is not completely understood. Datta et al. (16Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar) have observed that activation of Akt lead to serine phosphorylation of Bad, a pro-apoptotic protein of Bcl-2 family, and in turn suppressed apoptosis of transformed cells. However, whether activation of PI 3-kinase can lead to phosphorylation of Bad in cardiac muscle cells is not known. Our laboratory (13Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Chen J.-W. Wang P.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Lee W.-L. Wang P.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) has observed that doxorubicin increased the activity of caspase 3 and induced apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells, whereas IGF-I suppressed activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Caspase 3 is a key component of apoptotic signaling that mediates both mitochondria-dependent and -independent apoptotic signaling. Although the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-I may be in part mediated by PI 3-kinase, it is unclear whether activation of PI 3-kinase pathway alone suppresses activation of caspase 3 in cardiac muscle or in other tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate whether activation of PI 3-kinase can lead to suppression of caspase 3 activation and in turn inhibit the occurrence of apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells. The results show that transduction of a constitutively active PI 3-kinase into cardiomyocytes suppressed activation of caspase 3 and attenuated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, transduction of active caspase 3 into cardiomyocytes was associated with decreased cardiomyocyte viability. Since activation of PI 3-kinase was not associated with serine phosphorylation of Bad, we concluded that in cardiac muscle cells, PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling inhibited caspase cascades through a mechanism independent of Bad phosphorylation. These results thus provide a novel link between PI 3-kinase pathway and suppression of caspase 3 activation in a tissue where apoptosis plays a significant pathophysiological role.

Primary cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats according to a protocol previously described (17Flink I.L. Edwards J.G. Bahl J.J. Liew C. Sole M. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9917-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To infect adenoviral vectors, cardiomyocytes were incubated with indicated concentrations of adenoviral vectors in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 16–36 h. Two recombinant adenoviruses based on Ad5 vectors were used in our study. The construction of an adenoviral vector expressing a constitutively active PI 3-kinase (Ad5-p110*) and another one expressing β-galactosidase (Ad5-lacZ) had been described previously (18Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The viruses were replicated in 293 cells, purified by CsCl2 ultracentrifugation, and the viral titers were determined by plaque assay in 293 cells. Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was induced by adding doxorubicin to serum-free DMEM for 6 h as described previously (13Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Chen J.-W. Wang P.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Lee W.-L. Wang P.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When indicated, after overnight serum deprivation, IGF-I and/or LY294002 were added 1 h prior to doxorubicin treatment. Apoptosis is accompanied by fragmentation of DNA. To determine the occurrence of DNA fragmentation, total DNA was extracted from control and treated cardiomyocytes using Gentra DNA Isolation Kit (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, both attached cells and detached cells floating in the medium were collected by scraping and centrifuging (2000 ×g for 10 min). After incubating with 300 μl of Lysis Buffer at 65 °C for 30 min, the lysates were digested by 1.5 μl of RNase A (4 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. The proteins were excluded by adding 100 μl of Protein Precipitation Solution and cleared with microfuge; the DNA in supernatants was precipitated by adding 300 μl of isopropyl ethanol at −20 °C for 1 h. The DNA pellets were dissolved in TE buffer (pH 7.4) and equal amounts of DNAs were resolved with 1.5% agarose gel and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Cell monolayers were incubated with defined medium in the presence or absence of doxorubicin, IGF-I, and LY294002. The cells were then harvested and solubilized with a lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPP, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were electronically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters. The filters were first incubated with a blocking solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat milk or 3% bovine serum album, and 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h and then with primary antibodies for 1.5 h, washed three times (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mmNaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with 1:10,000 diluted 400 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated Affini-Pure goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) for 45 min at room temperature, washed again three times, and then visulized by ECL. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (300–600 μg of proteins) were pre-absorbed with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at 4 °C for 30 min, incubated with specific antibodies and Protein A beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C, centrifuged briefly to pellet the protein A beads and rinse three times with washing buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted from Protein A beads by heating with 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The proteins were immediately applied to SDS-PAGE for subsequent immunoblotting with specific antibodies, and visualized with ECL as described above. The activities of caspase 3 were determined with the CPP32 assay kit from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (13Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Chen J.-W. Wang P.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Lee W.-L. Wang P.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were solubilized, and 100 μg of lysate proteins were reacted with 50 μm DEVD-AFC at 37 °C for 45 min. The samples were analyzed with a Cytofluor 2300 Fluorescence Measurement System (Millipore) at excitation of 425 nm and emission of 530 nm. Exposure of phosphatidylserine on outer plasma membrane is a key sign of apoptosis, thus staining of phosphatidylserine with annexin V can be used as a marker to define the occurrence of apoptosis (19Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4601) Google Scholar). Annexin V staining was performed with Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For this purpose, cardiomyocytes were grown in 60-mm Petri dishes. The cells were washed twice with PBS buffer and incubated with annexin-binding buffer containing 0.5% fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V for 30 min at room temperature. After briefly rinsed with PBS, the cardiomyocytes were analyzed under an Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope at the wavelengths of 480 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission). The images were recorded with a Sensys digital camera and analyzed with PathVision imaging software. For each dish, 10 random microscopic fields were recorded and the number of annexin V-positive cells were counted. After the results of annexin V staining were recorded, the cardiomyocytes were immediately fixed with methanol/acetone (50:50) and stained with propidium iodide to count the number of cells on each dish. Since propidium iodide stains all cells after fixation, the average number of cardiomyocytes from 10 random microscopic fields was then used as the denominator to calculate the percent of annexin V-positive cardiomyocytes in each dish. Cell viability was performed by staining the cells with calcein AM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) as described previously (20De Clerck L.S. Bridts C.H. Mertens A.M. Moens M.M. Stevens W.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Calcein AM is hydrolyzed to calcein and retains in live cells, and thus serves as an indicator for cell viability. To measure cell viability, cardiomyocytes were plated in 96- or 48-well plates. Then the cells underwent doxorubicin, IGF-I, and/or LY294002 treatment as described above. After rinsing twice with PBS buffer (pH 7.4), 200 μl of 1 μm calcein AM (in PBS) were added to each well and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The plates were analyzed with the Cytofluor 2300 Fluorescence Measurement System (Millipore) at excitation of 485 nm and emission of 530 nm. The construction of TAT fusion protein expression vectors that were used in this study has been described previously (21Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S. Nature Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 22Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F.

Nature Med. 1999; 5: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In brief, TAT fusion proteins were prepared by sonicating high expressing BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) transfected with pTAT-HIV Pr, pTAT-wild type Casp 3, or pTAT-mutant Casp 3 in a buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0). The recombinant fusion proteins were purified first with Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then HiTrap Q or SP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and desalted by PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purity of protein preparation was confirmed with SDS-PAGE. To transduce cardiomyocytes with TAT fusion protein, the cardiomyocytes were incubated with different concentrations of purified proteins in DMEM containing 1% FBS for 16 h. This method generated nearly 100% transduction efficiency as described previously (22Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). The data were expressed as mean ± S.E. from four to six independent experiments and the statistical significance was tested by Student's t test. A pvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To test whether IGF-I suppression of cardiomyocytes apoptosis requires activation of PI 3-kinase, we used an in vitro model of cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced with doxorubicin (13Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Chen J.-W. Wang P.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Lee W.-L. Wang P.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes was incubated with 0.4 μm doxorubicin in serum-free medium and IGF-I was added prior to incubation with doxorubicin when indicated. After 6 h of doxorubicin incubation DNA was extracted from cardiomyocytes and resolved with 1.5% agarose gel to determine the occurrence of DNA fragmentation. Fig. 1 shows that IGF-I attenuated doxorubicin-induced fragmentation of DNA. When PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm) was added to the cultured medium before adding IGF-I, IGF-I could no longer retard the occurrence of DNA fragmentation. Moreover, LY294002 aggravated doxorubicin-induced fragmentation of DNA. These results strongly suggest that the survival effects of IGF-I in cardiomyocytes require activation of PI 3-kinase pathway, and raised the possibility that activation of PI 3-kinase plays an important role in maintaining the viability of cardiomyocytes. To test the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase activation leads to inhibition of cardiomyocytes apoptosis, a constitutively active PI 3-kinase was transferred to primary cardiomyocytes via adenoviral vector (Ad5-p110*). With adenoviral vector, >90% of cardiomyocytes were effectively transduced with the target gene. To monitor whether transduction of cardiomyocytes with Ad5-p110* lead to activation of PI 3-kinase signaling, activation of Akt/PKB was measured by phosphorylation of Akt as shown in Fig. 2. IGF-I phosphorylated Akt in the wild type cardiomyocytes and in cells transduced with bacterial β-galactosidase (Ad5-lacZ). Akt was also activated, as shown by increased phosphorylation and mobility shift on gel, in the cardiomyocytes transduced with Ad5-p110*. The maximal intensity of Akt phosphorylation stimulated by Ad5-p110* is similar to the intensity induced by IGF-I (10−8m). IGF-I also stimulated phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor, IRS1/2, and p44/42 MAP kinase in the wild type cells and in Ad5-lacZ-infected cells. But cells infected with Ad5-p110* did not show increased phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor, IRS1/2, or p44/42 MAP kinase. These data indicate that only PI 3-kinase signaling pathway was specifically activated in the cells transduced with Ad5-p110*. To further establish the specificity of Akt activation in the cardiomyocytes infected with Ad5-p110*, these cells were incubated with LY294002 for 1 h. The data showed that phosphorylation of Akt in Ad5-p110*-tranduced cells was suppressed to a level nearly undetectable (Fig. 3 A). To define the effects of PI 3-kinase activation on caspase 3, we have investigated activation of caspase 3 in the cells transduced with Ad5-p110* (Fig. 3, Band C). Caspase 3 is activated by cleavage of proenzyme into active subunits, therefore we first investigated processing of caspase 3 by assessing the presence of active 20-kDa subunits with Western blot (Fig. 3 B). The active fragments were nearly undetectable in the normal control cells and in the cells transduced with Ad5-lacZ, whereas doxorubicin treatment significantly increased the abundance of the active caspase 3 fragment. In contrast, the induction of active caspase 3 fragment after doxorubicin treatment was less in the cells transduced with Ad5-p110*. When Ad5-p110*-infected cardiomyocytes were preincubated with LY294002 to block activation of PI 3-kinase, abundant active caspase 3 fragments were detected upon doxorubicin treatment. Similar changes of caspase 3 enzyme activities were also observed. In the cells transduced with Ad5-lacZ, doxorubicin treatment increased the activities of caspase 3 and IGF-I treatment suppressed it as expected (Fig. 3 C). In the cells transduced with Ad5-p110*, doxorubicin-activated caspase 3 activities was attenuated to a level similar to IGF-I treatment. Conversely, addition of LY294002 to Ad5-p110*-transduced cells lead to a loss of inhibition on caspase 3 activities. These data indicate that PI 3-kinase signaling inhibits activation of caspase proenzyme and hence suppresses the activities of caspase 3 in doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes. Phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136 is one of the potential mechanisms through which Akt inhibits caspases activation (16Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar). To study whether IGF-I and PI 3-kinase stimulation can lead to phosphorylation of Bad in cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocytes were either stimulated with IGF-I or transduced with Ad5-p110* and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Bad antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-pBad (Ser136) antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 4, IGF-I stimulation in control cells or Ad5-lacZ-cells was not associated with serine phosphorylation of Bad. Moreover, overexpression of Ad5-p110* failed to induce Bad phosphorylation. These findings suggest that inhibition of caspase 3 by IGF-I and by overexpression of PI 3-kinase in cardiomyocytes does not involve serine 136 phosphorylation of Bad. The next series of experiments are designed to determine whether activation of PI 3-kinase signaling can inhibit cell death. For this purpose, we first analyzed the occurrence of DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. To detect DNA fragmentation, DNA was extracted and resolved on 1.5% agarose gel. As shown in Fig. 5, doxorubicin treatment lead to fragmentation of DNA in the control cells with Ad5-lacZ, but DNA fragmentation was suppressed in the cells stimulated with IGF-I and in the cells transduced with Ad5-p110*. Addition of PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 reversed the inhibitory effects of PI 3-kinase on DNA fragmentation. In addition to DNA fragmentation, the effects of Ad5-p110* on cardiomyocyte apoptosis were confirmed with annexin V staining. Annexin V has high affinity for phosphatidylserine. In apoptotic cells the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to the outer plasma membrane, thus annexin V can bind to the exposed phosphatidylserine in apoptotic cells (19Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4601) Google Scholar). In the cells transduced with Ad5-lacZ, doxorubicin treatment increased the number of annexin V-stained cardiomyocytes and IGF-I reduced the number of annexin V-positive cells as we have anticipated (Fig. 6). Moreover, the effects of IGF-I was reversed with preincubation of LY294002. These data confirmed the results of the DNA fragmentation study (Fig. 1) that IGF-I suppression of cardiomyocyte apoptosis requires activation of PI 3-kinase pathway. In the cells transduced with Ad5-p110* and treated with doxorubicin, the number of annexin V-positive cells were decreased and preincubation with LY294002 blocked the protective effects of Ad5-p110*. To further define the effects of active PI 3-kinase on cardiomyocyte survival, the cells were transduced with either Ad5-lacZ or Ad5-p110* and then the cells were incubated with doxorubicin to induce apoptosis (Fig. 7). As expected, in the control cells doxorubicin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the number of viable cells, and IGF-I reduced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin. In the cells transduced with Ad5-p110*, the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin was attenuated to a level similar to the IGF-I-treated cells (p = 0.43). These experiments indicate that activation of PI 3-kinase increased cardiac muscle resistance to the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin.Figure 7Activation of PI 3-kinase enhanced cardiomyocyte survival. The cells were transduced with Ad5-lacZ (control cells) or Ad5-p110* for 36 h. When indicated the cells were treated with IGF-I and/or doxorubicin for 24 h. The cells were stained with 1 μm calcein AM for 45 min at room temperature and analyzed at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530 nm.

However, whether activation of caspase 3 alone can lead to cardiomyocyte death is not known. To this end, a TAT-caspase 3 fusion protein (TAT-wild type Casp 3) was transduced into cardiomyocytes to induce activation of caspase 3. TAT-wild type Casp 3, substituting the natural caspase 3 cleavage sites with HIV protease cleavage sites, was transduced into cardiomyocytes. A functionally inert TAT-mutant Casp 3, substituting a cysteine with methionine, was transduced to the control cells. Using this strategy, TAT-wild type Casp 3 became activated when co-transduced with TAT-HIV-protease. Fig. 8 shows that 16 h after transduction, cardiomyocytes viability was significantly decreased in the cells co-transduced with TAT-wild type Casp 3 and TAT-HIV-protease, whereas co-transduction of TAT-mutant Casp 3 and TAT-HIV-protease did not decrease cell viability. Moreover, there was a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the cells transduced with increasing concentrations of TAT-wild type Casp 3. These data indicate that activation of caspase 3 alone is sufficient to cause cell death in cardiomyocytes, and provide a strong argument that PI 3-kinase inhibition of caspase 3 activation plays an important role in the anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I in cardiomyocytes. The findings of this study delineated the relationship of PI 3-kinase, caspase 3 activation, and apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells. Apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells was recently recognized as a new paradigm that occurs in human and experimental models of heart failure. This emerging concept of cardiomyocyte apoptosis has important implications on cardiac function because loss of cardiomyocytes could be a fundamental part of the myocardial process that initiates or aggravates heart failure. For example, administration of doxorubicin is associated with heart failure and reduced number of cardiac muscle cells per functional units (24Olson R.D. Mushlin P.S. FASEB J. 1990; 13: 3076-3086Crossref Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and in vitro incubation of cardiomyocytes with doxorubicin lead to activation of caspase 3 and occurrence of apoptosis (13Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Chen J.-W. Wang P.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Wang L. Ma W. Markovich R. Lee W.-L. Wang P.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). IGF-I can attenuate apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells induced by doxorubicin and apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells in various experimental models of cardiomyopathy (10Buerke M. Murohara T. Skurk C.

Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the signaling pathways of IGF-I, relatively little is known about how IGF-I signaling modulates apoptotic signaling. The results of this study indicate that activation of caspase 3 was sufficient to cause cardiomyocyte death and that activation of PI 3-kinase signaling can suppress activation of caspase 3 and hence inhibit the occurrence of apoptosis. There is ample evidence suggesting that activation of PI 3-kinase may lead to suppression of caspase 3 and DNA fragmentation in a variety of cells. Most of the evidence derived from studies using pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (LY294002 and wortmannin), inhibition of PI 3-kinase with these compounds lead to cell apoptosis or loss of anti-apoptotic effects of growth factors (25Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Matsui T. Li L. Monte F.D. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A.

Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several other studies used dominant negative constructs of PI 3-kinase to inhibit PI 3-kinase signaling and further confirmed that PI 3-kinase is essential in maintaining cell survival (10Buerke M. Murohara T. Skurk C. Nuss C. Tomaselli K. Lefer A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8031-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 28Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, from these studies it is not clear whether activation of PI 3-kinase alone is sufficient to protect the cells from apoptosis induction and whether PI 3-kinase activation suppresses caspase activation. A downstream target of PI 3-kinase that may mediate the anti-apoptotic actions of PI 3-kinase is Akt. Akt pathways may modulate sequential steps of apoptosis signaling. Activation of Akt may lead to phosphorylation of Bad (16Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar), induction of Bcl-2 family of proteins (31Matsuzaki H. Tamatani M. Mitsuda N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Miyake S. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2037-2046PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of cytochrome crelease from mitochondria (32Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation and inactivation of caspase 9 (33Fujita E. Jinbo A. Matuzaki H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Momoi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Some of these observations appear to be dependent upon the experimental system used. For example, Akt phosphorylation of caspase 9 was reported in human neoplastic cells, but murine caspase 9 lacks the phosphorylation motif and cannot be phosphorylated by Akt (33Fujita E. Jinbo A. Matuzaki H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Momoi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, we were unable to find phosphorylation of Bad by IGF-I or by activation of PI 3-kinase in cardiomyocytes. Thus it appears survival signaling may employ different mechanisms to antagonize apoptosis in different cells. These signaling steps can be variably dependent on the type of tissue, the type of species, the state of cell transformation or differentiation, and the nature of apoptosis inducers. The lack of Bad phosphorylation in IGF-I-stimulated and in Ad5-p110*-tranduced cardiomyocytes suggests that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling may utilize survival pathways independent of Bad. When cardiomyocytes were incubated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the protective effects of IGF-I and Ad5-p110* were reversed and caspase 3 activities increased to a level higher than the caspase 3 activities induced by doxorubicin alone. LY294002 is a very effective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase signaling as phosphorylation of Akt in LY294002-treated cells was suppressed to a level lower than the basal phosphorylation of Akt in control cardiomyocytes. Adding LY294002 alone to culture medium for a prolonged period of time lead to induction of moderate cardiomyocyte apoptosis (data not shown). It is possible that LY294002 completely inhibited the basal activities of PI 3-kinase and thus lead to a greater induction of apoptosis in the cardiomyocytes treated with both doxorubicin and LY294002. Together with our finding that activation of PI 3-kinase inhibited induction of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, these observations indicate PI 3-kinase is essential for cardiomyocyte viability. Caspases are stored as proenzymes and can be cleaved into active fragments upon apoptosis induction. The process of cleavage is mediated by proteolysis and generates two subunits (10 and 20 kDa), these two subunits form heterodimers that eventually produce the enzymatic activities of caspases (34Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase 3 plays a pivotal role in execution of apoptosis; ES cells deficient in caspase 3 were resistant to apoptosis induction (35Colussi P.A. Kumar S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In human cardiomyopathy, apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells is associated with release of cytochromec and activation of caspase 3 (36Narula J. Pandey P. Arbustini E. Haider N. Narula N. Kolodgie F.D. Dal Bello B. Semigran M.J. Bielsa-Masdeu A. Dec G.W. Israels S. Ballester M. Virmani R. Saxena S. Kharbanda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Activation of myocardial caspase 3 was also observed in experimental models of post-transplant cardiac rejection (37Koglin J. Granville D.J. Glysing-Jensen T. Mudgett J.S. Carthy C.M. McManus B.M. Russell M.E. Circulation. 1999; 99: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which are accompanied by inflammatory reactions and myocardial apoptosis. These studies suggest that caspase 3 represents a potential therapeutic target for suppression of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Caspase 3 activation may lead to propagation of apoptosis signaling and structural disintegration of cells. Intracellular targets of caspases cascades include ICAD, gelsolin, PAK2, PKC, lamins, NuMa, actin, catenin, FAK, PARP, and several transcription factors (38Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The exact roles of these molecules in the execution of apoptosis are not entirely clear at present. However, studies thus far suggest that these molecules represent different components of apoptosis machinery that ultimately terminate survival signaling, dissolve cell integrity, promote cell packaging, and facilitate phagocytosis of cell remnants. Using peptide inhibitor of caspases, Bialik et al. (39Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) also have shown that cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by serum and glucose withdrawal can be attenuated. Our data show that activation of caspase 3 alone was sufficient to cause cell death in cardiac muscle, suggesting preservation of myocardial viability can be achieved with inhibition of caspase 3. Since PI 3-kinase has additional beneficial effects on cell growth and metabolism, gene transfer of active PI 3-kinase to cardiomyocytes may have potential therapeutic implications on the preservation of cardiac muscle in cardiac diseases. Parrizas et al. (40Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) have reported that inhibition of PI 3-kinase or MEK signaling with chemical inhibitors lead to attenuation of the anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I in cardiomyocytes. In IGF-I signaling pathways, p85 PI 3-kinase subunit interacts with phosphorylated IRS 1/IRS 2 and then activates p110 catalytic subunit. There are conflicting data on whether activation of PI 3-kinase lead to activation of Ras and MAP kinase signaling. Activation of PI 3-kinase resulted in activation of Raf-1/MEK pathways in some experimental systems, whereas other studies failed to demonstrate activation of MAP kinase signaling by PI 3-kinase (41Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Activation of MEK/ERK signaling was not observed in the cardiomyocytes transduced with active PI 3-kinase. These findings support the notion that in cardiac muscle cells MEK/ERK signaling is not downstream from PI 3-kinase, and suggest that the anti-apoptotic effects of PI 3-kinase activation in cardiomyocytes does not involve activation of MEK/ERK pathway.

In the cytosol, Rac is found as a C-terminally prenylated (geranylgeranylated) protein (13Kinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol.

Dissociation of prenylated Rac from Rho GDI was proposed to be an obligatory step preceding translocation of Rac from the cytosol to the membrane (14Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J.

Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that, whereas membrane association of prenylated Rac (Rac1 or -2) is mediated principally by hydrophobic interaction between the geranylgeranyl tail and membrane lipids, nonprenylated Rac1 binds by electrostatic interaction between a C-terminal polybasic region (21Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and negative charges on the membrane. We intended to test the hypothesis that binding of Rac to the membrane is a crucial event in the initiation of oxidase assembly. We found indeed that prenylated, but not nonprenylated, Rac1 initiates oxidase assembly and NADPH-dependent O⨪2 production in a cell-free system, containing phagocyte membranes and p67phox , in the absence of an amphiphilic activator and of p47phox . This demonstrates that, under certain conditions, targeting of Rac1 to the phagocyte membrane is sufficient for the initiation of oxidase assembly and suggests that the principal (or only) role of Rac is to act as a carrier for p67phox , from the cytosol to the membrane. Phagocyte membranes were prepared from guinea pig peritoneal macrophages elicited by the injection of mineral oil, as described (3Bromberg Y. Pick E.

These vesicles were found to have aMr exceeding 40 × 106 by gel filtration on a Superose 6 fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column.

The purified cytochrome b559 was relipidated with soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) (10–20% phosphatidylcholine, type II-S, product 5638; Sigma), at a concentration of 200 μg/ml, as described before (23Knoller S.

In some experiments, we used bacterially expressed p67phox (human); this was also isolated from E. coli as a fusion protein with GST. cDNA of truncated p67phox (residues 1–212) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction, and the fragment was cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-p67phox -(1–212) fusion protein was expressed inE. coli (DH5α-competent cells; Life Technologies) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Sigma). The cDNA for Rac1 was extracted from the pGEX-2T clone, used for the expression of the protein in E. coli, by digestion with the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI. In order to express His6-Rac1 in insect cells, the cDNA was cloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pBacPAK-His1 (CLONTECH). Rac1 cDNA was introduced into the baculovirus genome using the BaculoGold system (PharMingen). Positive colonies from plaque assays were used for the production of virus stocks that served for the infection of Sf9 cell suspension cultures in serum-free medium. Infected Sf9 cells, grown for 72 h in an orbital shaker at 27 °C, were sedimented and disrupted by sonication in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and membranes and cytosol were separated by centrifugation at 43,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times in buffer A, resuspended in the same buffer, and frozen at −75 °C. Thawed membranes were solubilized in buffer A, supplemented with 21 mm sodium cholate (Sigma), and the His6-tagged prenylated Rac1 was batch-purified on Talon metal affinity resin beads (CLONTECH), using 50 mm imidazole, in buffer A containing 21 mm sodium cholate, for elution. Prenylation of Rac1 was confirmed by its ability to form a heterodimer with Rho GDI, this being identified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 and anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q. His6-tagged nonprenylated Rac1 was purified from the cytosol by the same technique, except for the use of 50 mm imidazole in buffer A, lacking sodium cholate. His6-tagged prenylated Cdc42Hs was a kind gift from Dr. R. A. Cerione (Cornell University). It was produced by baculoviral expression in Sf21 cells and purified from the membrane fraction. The protein was found to react on immunoblot with a polyclonal anti-Cdc42Hs antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; product sc-87). Its functional integrity was ascertained by its ability to form a complex with Rho GDI. Prenylated and nonprenylated Rac1 (in buffers containing 5 mm MgCl2) were subjected to nucleotide exchange with GTPγS or GDPβS, at a free Mg2+ concentration of 0.5 μm, attained by adding 9 mm EDTA, at a 30-fold molar excess of nucleotide over protein, by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. The exchange was stabilized by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 30 mm. Unbound nucleotide was removed by applying the protein to a HiTrap desalting column (5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluting this with buffer A, supplemented or not with 21 mmsodium cholate, and collecting the protein-rich fractions. In cases in which Rac preparations were intended for use in gel filtration experiments, the HiTrap column elution buffer was supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol, and sodium cholate was replaced by 3.12 mm octyl glucoside (modified from Ref. 20Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In both 21 mm sodium cholate and 3.12 mm octyl glucoside plus 20% glycerol, prenylated Rac was maintained in soluble form. Assembly of the oxidase complex was assessed by measuring NADPH-dependent O⨪2 production in a cell-free system, consisting of total membrane or purified cytochromeb559 vesicles (5 nm cytochromeb559 heme), recombinant prenylated Rac1 (0–500 nm; subjected to nucleotide exchange to either GTPγS or GDPβS), and recombinant p67phox (0–1600 nm), in 96-well microplates, in a volume of 200 μl of assay buffer (25Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) per well. No free GTPγS was added to the reaction. In some experiments, p47phox was included, at a concentration of 300 nm. The mixtures were incubated for 90 s at 25 °C, in the absence of an amphiphilic activator, and O⨪2generation was initiated by the addition of NADPH (240 μm). O⨪2 production was measured by the kinetics of cytochrome c reduction, as described before (25Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specificity of cytochrome c reduction was controlled by its inhibition by superoxide dismutase (Sigma). Amphiphile-dependent cell-free oxidase activation was performed using the same concentrations of components as indicated above but with the addition of p47phox (300 nm) and lithium dodecyl sulfate (LiDS) (130 μm). Prenylated or nonprenylated Rac1 were subjected to nucleotide exchange with the fluorescent analogues 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) guanosine 5′-triphosphate (mant-GTP) or mant-GDP (26Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), as described for nonfluorescent nucleotides, except for not removing unbound nucleotides. Rac1 labeled with fluorescent analogue (1500 pmol) was mixed or not with either membrane vesicles (250 pmol of cytochromeb559 heme) or PC vesicles (0.6 mg of lipid), injected in a Superose 12 HR 10/30 FPLC gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a buffer consisting of 65 mm sodium, potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mmNaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 μm FAD. Its composition is, in essence, identical to reaction buffer used in the cell-free oxidase assay (25Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chromatography was performed on an HPLC system (Waters), at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, at 4 °C, and the fluorescent signal (excitation = 356 nm; emission = 445 nm) was measured continuously, by passing the column eluate through a spectrofluorometer (model FP-770; Jasco), fitted with an HPLC flow cell. Vesicles prepared from solubilized membrane (250 pmol of cytochrome b559 heme) were mixed with prenylated or nonprenylated Rac1 (1500 pmol), with p67phox (1500 pmol), or with both Rac1 and p67phox (1500 pmol of each), in a total volume of 0.6 ml of column elution buffer, in the absence of an activating amphiphile. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the mixture was injected in a Superose 12 gel filtration column, and chromatography was performed as described above, except for the fact that the absorbance of the eluate was measured continuously at 280 and 413 nm, by an HP 1040A diode array detector (Hewlett-Packard). Throughout chromatography, 0.6-ml fractions were collected. The elution volume of membrane vesicles was identified by a major peak in the 413-nm absorbance profile, representing a measure of the amount of cytochrome b559. The amounts of membrane-bound Rac1 and p67phox were determined by an NADPH oxidase activity reconstitution assay (see below), and the relative amounts of membrane-bound and free p67phox were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this assay, 2Y. Gorzalczany, N. Sigal, and E. Pick, manuscript in preparation. the membrane association of a certain cytosolic oxidase component was demonstrated by the ability of a sample, taken from fractions containing the membrane vesicles, to produce O⨪2 when supplemented with the two other cytosolic oxidase components and activated by LiDS. First, the amount of cytochrome b559 present in membrane vesicles was determined by addition to a mixture of p47phox , p67phox , and nonprenylated Rac1-GTPγS. Membrane-associated Rac1 was quantified by the addition to a mixture of p47phox and p67phox , and membrane-associated p67phox was quantified by addition to a mixture of p47phox and nonprenylated Rac1-GTPγS. In all assays, 20 μl of column fraction were added to 180 μl of reaction mixture, containing the supplementing cytosolic components, each at 100 nm, and 130 μm LiDS. Incubation was for 90 s, and O⨪2 production was initiated by the addition of 240 μm NADPH. With the purpose of confirming results obtained by the assay described above, free and membrane-bound p67phox were measured by ELISA (27Jouan A. Pilloud-Dagher M.-C. Fuchs A. Vignais P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 251-259Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Column fractions were diluted 1:10 in elution buffer and added in volumes of 100 μl, in triplicate, to 96-well microplates (MaxiSorp C96, Nunc). The proteins were allowed to adhere to the wells for 18 h at 4 °C, and the plates were processed as described in Ref. 27Jouan A. Pilloud-Dagher M.-C. Fuchs A. Vignais P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 251-259Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar. p67phox was detected by a goat polyclonal antiserum to recombinant human p67phox , diluted 1:1000, followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (H + L) (code 305-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted 1:10,000. Peroxidase was quantified by the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system (product T8665; Sigma), followed by 0.5 mH2SO4, and absorbance at 450 nm was read in a Spectramax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Three categories of compounds were studied for an inhibitory effect on amphiphile-independent oxidase assembly, involving prenylated Rac1: (a) Rho GDI; (b) PC vesicles, and (c) a synthetic peptide, corresponding to residues 177–191 of Rac1 (>70% pure; Chiron Technologies). Potential inhibitors were added to the assay mixture either from the beginning, being present during the 90 s of incubation (assembly) preceding the addition of NADPH, or after incubation of the oxidase components for 5 min, to be followed, after another 90 s, by the addition of NADPH. Controls were always run in parallel, by adding a volume of buffer equal to that of the inhibitory compound tested. In all experiments, the concentration of membrane corresponded to 5 nm cytochromeb559 heme; Rac1 was in the GTPγS-bound form (unless specified otherwise), and both Rac1 and p67phox were at a concentration of 300 nm. The design was identical for comparative experiments, involving prenylated or nonprenylated Rac1, p67phox , p47phox , and activation by LiDS (130 μm). The initial aim of this investigation was to reexamine the influence of the state of prenylation of Rac1 on its ability to support cell-free assembly of the oxidase complex. Earlier work seemed to indicate that prenylation of Rac is essential for oxidase activation (18Ando S. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Hiraoka K. Nishiyama T. Mizuno T. Asada M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Matsuura Y. Polakis P. McCormick F. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25709-25713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a result that disagreed with reports describing activation by nonprenylated Rac, exchanged to GTPγS (5Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 17Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L. Bokoch G. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A more recent report clearly indicates that prenylated Rac is a superior activator because of its higher affinity for the phagocyte membrane, mediated by hydrophobic interaction between the geranylgeranyl group and membrane lipids (20Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Common to all of these findings is the requirement for an anionic amphiphile and for the presence of both p47phox and p67phox , for activation to take place. We found that, surprisingly, a cell-free system consisting of phagocyte membrane vesicles and recombinant prenylated Rac1, p67phox , and p47phox produces O⨪2 upon the addition of NADPH, in the absence of any activator. Next, we found that the presence of p47phox is not required, its absence leading to only a minor reduction in the amount of O⨪2 produced; however, no O⨪2 is produced if p67phox is replaced by p47phox , either in the absence or presence of amphiphile. The level of oxidase activation by prenylated Rac1 in the absence of amphiphile and p47phox , as expressed by O⨪2 production, is comparable with that customary in the complete amphiphile-activated cell-free system. Amphiphile and p47phox -independent oxidase activation, of the same or superior intensity, is also occurring when membrane vesicles are replaced by partially purified cytochromeb559 incorporated in PC vesicles. The characteristics of this novel oxidase activation system are summarized in Table I. Thus, the absence or heat inactivation (95 °C for 30 min) of any of the three obligatory components of the reaction results in a total lack of O⨪2production. Prenylation of Rac1 is a sine qua non condition for activity; nonprenylated Rac1 is incapable of inducing O⨪2production, whether derived from E. coli (Table I; Fig. 1, A and B) or from the cytosol of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and containing a His6 tag (results not shown). Most of the experiments here described were executed with vesicles derived from solubilized macrophage membrane, but identical results were obtained with nonsolubilized membrane suspension. Maximal activation is achieved by 90 s; prolonging incubation of components for up to 10 min does not alter the level of activation. In the presence of a constant amount of membrane or purified cytochrome b559, oxidase activity is proportional with the concentration of prenylated Rac1 (Fig. 1, A and B) and p67phox (Fig. 1 C). It is of interest that, in the presence of either total membrane or purified cytochrome b559 and p67phox , both the GTPγS- and the GDPβS-bound forms of prenylated Rac1 are active, with Rac1-GTPγS being only marginally more effective (Fig. 1, A and B). The possible reasons for this finding are addressed under “Discussion.” Recombinant p67phox proteins, isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells or from E. coli are both capable of cooperation with prenylated Rac, and p67phox truncated at residue 212 is as potent as full-length protein (Fig. 1 C), in accordance with the finding that the Rac-binding domain is located within the first 199 residues of p67phox (28Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A.

The amyloid prion protein fragment 106–126 (P106–126) has been shown to be toxic in cultured hippocampal neurons (1Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Here, we show that P106–126 is also cytotoxic in vivo. Taking advantage of the fact that retina is an integral part of the central nervous system, the toxic effect of the peptide was investigated by direct intravitreous injection. Aged solutions of P106–126 induced apoptotic-mediated retinal cell death and irreversibly altered the electrical activity of the retina. Neither apoptosis nor electroretinogram damages were observed with freshly diluted P106–126, suggesting that the toxicity is linked to the aggregation state of the peptide. The retina provides a convenient in vivo system to look for potential inhibitors of cytotoxicity associated with spongiform encephalopathies.

Br. Med. Bull. 1993; 49: 792-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). TSE are characterized by the accumulation of large aggregates of the prion protein, PrP-res, in both human and animal brains. The abnormal PrP-res isoform has a high content of β-sheet secondary structure, forms amyloid fibrils, and is partially resistant to proteolysis (3Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 4Pan K.-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E.

The precursor of the pathological isoform PrP-res is a normal host glycoprotein (termed PrP-sen) widely expressed in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. Unlike PrP-res, PrP-sen is a protease-sensitive protein, soluble in mild detergents, and has mainly α-helix structures (6Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B.

Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the development of spongiform pathologies requires the presence of both isoforms PrP-res and PrP-sen (9Brandner S. Isenmann S. Raeber A.J. Fischer M. Sailer A. Kobayashi Y. Marino S. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Nature. 1996; 379: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), the level of PrP-sen expression being an essential factor in the pathology (10Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). In experimental transmissions with transgenic mice, it was found that increasing the number ofPrP gene copies led to a decreased incubation time of the disease (11Carlson G.A. Ebeling C. Yang S.L.

The in vivo mechanisms leading to the synaptic loss and neuronal death are not elucidated, but the possible involvement of apoptotic processes has been postulated and is consistent with the lack of inflammation stigmata in TSE-affected brains. The neural tissue damages could be due exclusively to PrP-res deposits, and/or to disruption of PrP-sen physiological functions, and/or to cytotoxic effects induced by PrP fragments or PrP-res aggregates. PrP-res and a synthetic peptide fragment (P106–126) have been shown to be cytotoxicin vitro likely via the programmed cell death pathway (1Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M.

Like PrP-res, the P106–126 peptide is partially resistant to proteinase K, presents a high β-sheet enriched structure, and forms amyloid fibrils in vitro (14Selvaginni C. De Gioia L. Cantù L.

(15Hope J. Shearman M.S. Baxter H.C. Chong A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Neurodegeneration. 1996; 5: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have shown that the expression of PrP-sen is necessary for P106–126 to exert its cytotoxic effects. Whether the apoptotic process could account for in vivoneurodegeneration taking place during the development of TSE remains unclear. The induction of apoptosis has been suggested in scrapie-infected mouse brain (16Giese A. Groschup M.H. Hess B. Kretzschmar H.A. Brain Pathol. 1995; 5: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), as well as in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (17Gray F. Chretien F. Adle-Biassette H. Dorandeu A. Ereau T. Delisle M.B. Kopp N.

In the present report, we examined whether the PrP fragment P106–126 can induce apoptotic-mediated cell death in vivo. To address this question, we directly administrated P106–126 into rat eyes taking advantage of the fact that the retina is an integral part of the central nervous system. Apoptotic process induced by P106–126 was demonstrated by means of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and of the DNA fragmentation technique. Neuronal death was confirmed by measurement of the electrical activity of the retina. The human sequence of the prion protein fragment (P106–126; KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG) was purchased from Bachem. The prion fragment used as a control peptide (P89–103; GQGGGTHNQWNKPSK) was synthesized by Eurogentec. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 5 mm, distributed into 20-μl aliquots, and stored at −20 °C. Peptides were diluted twice with 2× PBS minus Ca2+ and immediately used or aged by incubation at room temperature for 3 days. Adult male albino Wistar rats (35–55 days old) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital followed by a topical application of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride. The injections of 2 μl of peptides or vehicle (phosphate-buffered solution) were done unilaterally with a 30-gauge needle introduced into the posterior chamber on the upper pole of the eye directed toward the center of the vitreous. The injections were performed slowly to allow a better diffusion of the peptide and avoid any ocular hypertension. For negative controls, we both considered the uninjected contralateral eyes and eyes injected in the same conditions with 2 μl of vehicle (PBS). At least four animals were used in each group of experimental conditions. Rats were euthanatized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital 3 days post-intravitreal injections. The eyes were enucleated, and a puncture was made at the limbus to permit the infusion of the fixative solution. The eyes were immediately fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 h then cryoprotected overnight in PBS containing 20% sucrose and embedded in Tissue-Tek® (Sakura). Frozen sections (10 μm) were cut on a cryostat (Leica), and slides were heated at 50 °C for 60 min then stored at −20 °C until use. Thein situ cell death detection was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) then revealed using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) and processed for detailed examination by light microscopy. Morphological and histological observations of retinas were done by staining the sections with 1% cresyl violet. 2 μl of PBS alone or of 3-day-aged peptide P106–126 diluted extemporarily in PBS (corresponding to 0.05, 0.5, and 5 nmol) were injected as described above. For each condition, four rats were treated, and retina sections were processed simultaneously for the TUNEL-labeling assay. To evaluate the number of TUNEL-positive cells, photographs of retinal sections were collected at an original magnification of × 10. The intensity of gray of each layer (ganglion cell, G; inner nuclear, INL; outer nuclear, ONL) was quantified using the NIH image software system. The gray intensity was expressed per surface unit in arbitrary units. After enucleation, the retinas were dissected from the retinal epithelium and choroid. Proteins were then digested with 200 μg/ml of proteinase K in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) for 2 h at 55 °C. Retinal DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform solutions, and the aqueous phase was incubated with Dnase-free RNase A (100 μg/ml) and then precipitated in a solution of 0.3 msodium acetate in ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Precipitated DNA samples were resuspended in distilled water, and the DNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Samples of 10 μg of DNA were electrophoresed through 1.2% agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml of ethidium bromide. DNA bands were visualized by a UV light transilluminator and photographed. Dark-adapted ERGs were performed as described previously (19Ettaiche M. Fillacier K. Widmann C. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 729-736PubMed Google Scholar). Full-field ERG responses were obtained overnight with dark-adapted rats prepared under dim red light before recording. The pupils of anesthetized rats were dilated with a drop of 0.5% tropicamide. A silver chloride ring-recording electrode was placed on the cornea, and the reference electrode, with a silver-silver chloride tip, was connected to the ear. Light stimulus (10 μs) was provided by a stroboscopic flash (Grass Instruments Inc.) placed 0.25 m in front of the rat. The ERGs were recorded using the visual electroretinogram test system (LKC Technologies, Inc.) and then stored and analyzed. Amplitude of the a-wave was measured from the base line to the trough of the a-wave; b-wave amplitude was measured from the trough of the a-wave to the peak of the b-wave. The averaged responses represent the mean of five white flashes delivered four min apart. Electroretinograms were recorded before treatment and then at different times of recovery (1, 2, 3, and 7 days). The amplitude values of a- and b-waves obtained with each animal were normalized to base-line amplitudes at each time point of the study and expressed as percentage of base-line value. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. of values obtained with 4 rats per group. Results from the ERG recordings were not distributed normally and had unequal variance. Therefore, the Mann WitneyU test was used to compare the peptide and the vehicle-treated group of rats. Differences were considered statistically significant when P values were less than 0.02. The effect of freshly prepared or 3-day-aged P106–126 and soluble P89–103 PrP peptides on the retina cell death was examined after intravitreal injection. Fig. 1 shows representative photomicrographs of treated retina sections processed through the TUNEL labeling assay (Fig. 1, B–E) and the histology of PBS-treated retina stained with cresyl violet (Fig. 1 A). After intravitreal injections of aged P106–126 (5 nmol), TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the inner and outer nuclear layers, as well as in the ganglion cells layer (Fig. 1 D). When freshly prepared P106–126 was intravitreally injected, only occasional TUNEL-positive cells were observed (Fig. 1 C) suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of the peptide was linked to its physicochemical state. Intact retinas (data not shown) and retinas treated with PBS alone (Fig. 1 B) or soluble PrP peptide P89–103 (Fig. 1 E) showed only few TUNEL-positive cells. No differences in labeling patterns were observed between the lower and the upper poles of the retina where injections were done. To assess whether the cytotoxic effect was dose-dependent, rat eyes were treated for 72 h with PBS alone or containing 0.05, 0.5, or 5 nmol of aged P106–126. Corresponding retina sections were processed through the TUNEL-labeling assay and revealed with the DAB substrate. We previously checked that the intensity of gray coloration developed by the DAB substrate was directly proportional to the number of TUNEL-positive cells. This estimation method allowed us to screen a large surface layer and an important number of retinal sections. Fig.2 is a histogram representation of the relative gray intensity obtained for the inner and outer nuclear layers and the ganglion cells layer. The gray intensity of the three layers increases with the quantity of injected P106–126. Although 0.05 nmol of injected P106–126 was not significantly toxic for the retina cells, higher quantities induced TUNEL-labeled positive cells in ganglion cells and in inner and outer nuclear layers. When 5 nmol of P106–126 were injected, the TUNEL-labeling method showed that almost all the nuclei from the three layers were positive. To better discriminate between necrosis and apoptotic cell death, the fragmentation of the retinal DNA was studied. Four eyes were injected with vehicle alone or with 5 nmol of aged peptide P106–126 and analyzed at different times after inoculation. The peptide-treated retinas showed a ladder pattern of DNA degradation with bands corresponding to multiples of 180 to 200 base pairs (Fig. 3). The DNA laddering was clearly but slightly observable 24 h after injection and was more intense after 48 and 72 h. No DNA degradation was observed either in the PBS-treated retinas (Fig. 3, control lane) or in retinas treated with freshly prepared peptide P106–126 (data not shown). The electrical activity of peptide-treated or untreated retinas was monitored by recording the ERGs. Fig. 4 shows the effect of intravitreal injections on the electroretinograms and describes the variation of the a- and b-wave amplitudes several days after inoculation. When compared with vehicle-treated group, the aged P106–126-treated group exhibited significant deficits in both a- and b-wave amplitudes, direct evidence of persistent and long-term damages to retinal function. In the peptide-injected group, the a-wave amplitude decreased significantly at day 1 (71 ± 8%,p < 0.02) and continued to decline slowly from day 2 to day 7. Unlike the a-wave, the b-wave amplitude markedly decreased at day 1 (57 ± 8%) and then partly recovered at day 2 (78 ± 9%) and further decreased from day 3 (63 ± 6%) to day 7 (56 ± 7%). When electroretinogram recordings were done after injection of control peptide P89–103 or freshly prepared P106–126, no significant decrease on the a- and b-wave amplitudes could be observed (data not shown). For the last decade, many reports have shown that PrP peptide P106–126 could provide insights into the understanding of some aspects of TSE pathology (1Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 15Hope J. Shearman M.S. Baxter H.C. Chong A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C.

Although P106–126 does not cause infection or induce in vitro conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res isoform, it shares a number of physicochemical properties with the PrP-res molecule. For instance, P106–126 is partially proteinase K-resistant and displays high β-sheet structure (14Selvaginni C. De Gioia L. Cantù L. Ghibaudi E. Diomede L. Passerini F. Forloni G. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils formed in vitro by P106–126 are birefringent under polymerized light when stained by Congo red (22Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9678-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Like PrP-res, which causes cell death in vitro (13Müller W.E.G. Ushijima H. Schröder H.C. Forrest J.M.S. Schatton W.F.H. Rytik P.G. Heffner-Lauc M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), P106–126 can induce apoptotic cell death (1Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 23Florio T. Thellung S. Amico C. Robello M. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Forloni G. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, P106–126 exerts its toxic effects through direct and specific interactions with PrP-sen-expressing cells (20Brown D.R. Herms J. Kretzschmar H.A. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2057-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 24Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Groschup M.H. Kretzschmar H.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast with in vitro observations, neurotoxicity of P106–126 has never been reported after direct administration into the brain. Several explanations can be proposed for this discrepancy, including the rapid clearance of the peptide by the brain. Supporting this idea, PrP-res is detectable in the brain of intracerebrally infected mice a few days after infection, then it decreases to undetectable levels, and last the accumulation of the endogenous PrP-res starts (25Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.-P. Demaimay R. Adjou K.T. Hauw J.-J. Dormont D. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For several reasons, the retina seems to be an interesting in vivo model. First, retina is an integral part of the central nervous system; second, it is a closed system with a low content of proteolytic enzymes. Furthermore, the PrP-sen isoform is expressed in photoreceptor cells of adult retina (26Chishti M.A. Strome R. Carlson G.A. Westaway D. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 234: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, widespread retinopathy has been observed in scrapie-affected hamsters (27Buyukmihci N. Rorvik M. Marsh R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1169-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Hogan R.N. Baringer J.R. Prusiner S.B. Lab. Invest. 1981; 44: 34-42PubMed Google Scholar, 29Buyukmihci N.C. Goehring-Harmon F. Marsh R.F. Exp. Neurol. 1987; 97: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, the retina is a well suited model to study the molecular events leading to neuronal death in the course of the disease. For the first time, we show that aged P106–126 induces the death of retinal cells according to an apoptotic process and provides a significant reduction of the electrical activity of the retina. The observed effects of the peptide are monitored by DNA fragmentation and electroretinogram recording analysis and can be evidenced as soon as 24 h after intravitreal injection. Moreover, P106–126 causes long-term damages on the physiological activity of retina, because no recovery of the deleterious effects can be observed 7 days after peptide inoculation. The molecular mechanisms involved in the P106–126 toxicity are not completely understood. The relationship between toxicity and physicochemical properties of amyloid peptides has been extensively studied in vitro (30Salmona M. Malesani P. De Gioia L. Gorla S. Bruschi M. Molinari A. Della Vedova F. Pedrotti B. Marrari M.A. Awan T. Bugiani O. Forloni G. Tagliavini F. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Jobling M.F. Stewart L.R. White A.R.

The β-sheet structure adopted by P106–126 and its aggregation state are crucial (1Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 15Hope J. Shearman M.S. Baxter H.C. Chong A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Neurodegeneration. 1996; 5: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these previous reports, because intravitreous injections of freshly diluted P106–126 failed to cause cell death and modification of electrical activity of the retina. Moreover, Jenet al. (32Jen L.S. Hart A.J. Jen A. Relvas J.B. Gentleman S.M. Garey L.J. Patel A.J. Nature. 1998; 372: 140-141Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown recently that the amyloid peptides Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 involved in Alzheimer's disease also induced photoreceptor cells apoptosis after intravitreous injections. Here again, cell death was observed only with aged (aggregated) peptides, whereas freshly prepared solutions were devoid of cytotoxicity. As a positive control to our own experiments, the apoptotic response induced by aged solutions of Aβ1–40 have been reproduced in the present work (data not shown). There exists no sequence homology between Aβ1–40 and P106–126 peptides. However, both peptides share the same propency to form β-sheet structures and sedimentable aggregates. Taken together these data strongly suggest that the specific mode of the aggregation of P106–126, rather than its amino acid sequence, is responsible for the observed in vivo cell death. Apart from programmed-cell death, other molecular mechanisms of P106–126 toxicity have been proposed but are still controversial (33Manunta M. Kunz B. Sandmeier E. Christen P. Schindler H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The possible insertion of the peptide into the cell membrane could lead to channel formation, the subsequent disruption of ion homeostasis being responsible for the cell death (34Lin M.-C. Mirzabekov T. Kagan B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 44-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 35Kawahara M. Kuroda Y. Arispe N. Rojas E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14077-14083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that at least part of the neuronal loss observed in TSE diseases is because of the toxic effects of PrP-res and/or its degradation products. In contrast with Alzheimer's disease in which the overproduction of the amyloid peptides Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 is well documented, the catabolism of the PrP molecules remains unclear. An amino-terminally truncated fragment of PrP insoluble in detergents and resistant to protease has been purified from brains of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affected patients (36Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Caughey et al. (37Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also shown that a PrP-res isoform truncated at residue 90 is formed in scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, fragments of PrP-sen have been identified in extracts of normal brain, and the precise cleavage site has been mapped to His-111 or Met-112 (36Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cleavage occurring in physiological conditions disrupts the neurotoxic region of PrP-sen comprising amino acid residues 106–126. Thus, pathological conditions could promote the appearance of PrP toxic fragments that are never formed in physiological situation. In conclusion, our study provides the first in vivo evidence of the involvement of an apoptotic process in the cytotoxic mechanisms of the prion protein fragment P106–126 suggesting that similar mechanisms also occur in TSE. The retina model used in the present work is a powerful tool to further identify the molecular mechanisms leading to the neuronal loss that could be a general characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the retina model should serve for screening drugs able to limit cell damage and prevent neuronal loss.

Crystallographic and functional studies of chalcone synthase (CHS), a plant-specific PKS, indicate that a cysteine-histidine pair (Cys164-His303) forms part of the catalytic machinery. Thiol-specific inactivation and the pH dependence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reaction were used to evaluate the potential interaction between these two residues. Inactivation of CHS by iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid targets Cys164 in a pH-dependent manner (pKa = 5.50). The acidic pKa of Cys164 suggests that an ionic interaction with His303 stabilizes the thiolate anion. Consistent with this assertion, substitution of a glutamine for His303 maintains catalytic activity but shifts the pKa of the thiol to 6.61. Although the H303A mutant was catalytically inactive, the pH-dependent incorporation of [14C]iodoacetamide into this mutant exhibits a pKa = 7.62. Subsequent analysis of the pH dependence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by wild-type CHS and the H303Q and C164A mutants also supports the presence of an ion pair at the CHS active site.

Many polyketides possess pharmacological properties and are used as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-cancer agents, and anti-fungal agents (5Hutchinson C.R. Curr. Opin.

Despite the structural complexity of these compounds, a common chemical strategy underlies the biosynthetic mechanisms of different PKS. The initial reaction step involves loading a starter molecule onto an active site cysteine through an acyltransferase activity. Following formation of the primed acyl-enzyme complex, a decarboxylative condensation reaction extends the reaction intermediate. The elongation step can be repeated until an appropriate chain length is reached and the reaction product released. This process is analogous to the reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthases (FAS) (7Wakil R.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar).

Rather, at physiological pH, these two residues may form a stable imidazolium-thiolate ion pair. In other enzymes, notably the cysteine proteases (25Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27Polgar L. Csoma C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14448-14453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Storer A.C. Menard R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 486-500Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the thiolate anion of the catalytic cysteine is stabilized by an imidazolium ion on an adjacent histidine. The structural proximity of Cys164 and His303 in the CHS active site raises the potential for a similar mechanistic feature in this PKS.This paper describes the use of thiol-specific inactivators to evaluate the reactivity of Cys164, to determine the pKa of the active site cysteine, and to establish the role of His303 in maintaining the reactivity of Cys164. In addition, the pH dependence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by wild-type CHS and the H303Q and C164A mutants was examined. These studies demonstrate that Cys164 is a reactive thiolate anion with an acidic pKa that is modulated by interaction with His303. Combined with previous crystallographic and kinetic studies, this work provides insight on the mechanism of CHS and suggests that a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair plays a significant role in both polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis.DISCUSSIONIodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid inactivate CHS through specific modification of Cys164 at the active site. This result agrees with mutagenesis experiments of CHS in which substitution of the cysteine with a serine or alanine results in a complete loss of chalcone formation (23Lanz T Tropf S. Marner F.-J. Schröder G. Schröder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9971-9976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Importantly, the pKa of Cys164 indicates that a thiolate anion is present at the CHS active site at physiological pH to serve as the nucleophile in the loading reaction and as the attachment site of the polyketide during the elongation reactions. The acidic pKa of Cys164 also explains why the sulfhydryl group of this residue is oxidized to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) in several crystal structures of CHS (17Ferrer J.-L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 24Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Similar oxidation of the active site thiol in the cysteine proteases also occurs (37Kamphuis I.G. Kalk K.H. Swarte M.B.A. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 38Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, the reactive thiolate forms an ion pair with the imidazolium ion of an adjacent histidine residue (27Polgar L. Csoma C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14448-14453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the pKa value determined for Cys164 in CHS is not as low as the 3.3–4.0 pKa of the thiolate present at the active site of the cysteine proteases (25Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27Polgar L. Csoma C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14448-14453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the observed pKa of the CHS active site thiol is significantly shifted from the accepted pKa value of 8.0–8.5 for a cysteine sulfhydryl moiety (35Walsh C.T. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman, New York1979: 26Google Scholar). A reduction in pKa of this magnitude requires stabilization by the local environment. The proximity of His303 to Cys164 in the CHS structure suggests that the histidine, as an imidazolium cation, stabilizes the thiolate anion (Fig. 8).Figure 8Proposed interactions at the active site of wild-type and mutant CHS. The catalytic efficiencies of each enzyme (24Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and the pKa of inactivation are summarized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consistent with the presence of an ion pair at the CHS active site, the reactivity and pKa of Cys164 shifted when mutations of His303 were made. Substitution of a glutamine for His303 also maintains the thiolate of Cys164, but the resulting nucleophile is less reactive than in wild-type CHS. In the three-dimensional structure of the H303Q mutant (24Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), substitution of a glutamine for His303 is isosteric with the amide nitrogen of Gln303 hydrogen bonding the sulfhydryl of Cys164. Hydrogen bonding and a partial positive charge on the amide nitrogen arising from resonance stabilization promote formation of the thiolate at Cys164, albeit less efficiently and with a corresponding shift in pKa (Fig. 8).No stabilizing effect would be expected from the side chain of Ala303 in the H303A mutant (Fig. 8). As described previously (24Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the lack of malonyl-CoA decarboxylation and chalcone formation activities in this mutant underscores the mechanistic importance of the histidine. Although the pKa for iodoacetamide labeling of the H303A mutant is shifted to 7.62, the observed pKa is still 0.4–0.9 pH units below that of a free cysteine. Asn336 is another polar residue near Cys164 (4.1 Å), but substitution of the asparagine with an alanine does not alter the inactivation kinetics of the N336A mutant or the pKa of Cys164 in this mutant. 2J. M. Jez and J. P. Noel, unpublished observations. Since no other direct interactions occur with Cys164, the local environment may alter the pKa of this residue. Cys164 is at the N terminus of α-helix 9 in the CHS structure and the helix-dipole may further reduce the thiol's pKa in the absence of other interactions (40Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 41Dillet V. Dyson H.J. Bashford D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10298-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).If Cys164 and His303 form a stable ion pair, then the ionization states of both residues should be thermodynamically linked and a second inflection point observed in the pH profiles for inactivation. For example, in papain the pKa of the active site histidine shifts from 4.3 to 8.5 when the active site thiol is deprotonated (25Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Since the structure of wild-type CHS indicates that interaction between Cys164 and His303 occurs (17Ferrer J.-L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 24Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), it is likely that the absent inflection point is beyond the pH range studied. Therefore, the potential pKa of His303 in the free enzyme must be greater than 9.0, which is also consistent with the activity of the H303Q mutant, in which the glutamine's amide pKa is approximately 17.0 (39Kyte J. Structure in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, New York1995: 59Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, a stable thiolate-imidazolium ion pair in the CHS active site would maintain the nucleophilic thiolate required for the loading reaction.The pH dependence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reaction also supports the importance of a charged interaction at the CHS active site. In wild-type enzyme, the presence of an imidazolium ion would enhance formation of an enolate anion in the decarboxylation reaction (43O'Leary M.H. Sigman D.S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1992: 235-269Google Scholar). Since the kcat pH profile corresponds to the protonation state of the enzyme-substrate complex, the assignment of the observed pKa to any particular residue is problematic. Most likely, the observed break point represents enolization of malonyl-CoA during the decarboxylation reaction. Mutation of either His303 or Cys164 to an aprotic side chain eliminates the observed inflection point, suggesting that the rate-determining step in the decarboxylation reaction is altered. Although the H303Q and C164A mutants retain hydrogen bond donors at the active site as a glutamine and a histidine, respectively, the ionic pair at the active site is disrupted. Loss of the imidazolium ion in these mutants would slow substrate enolization and eliminate the observed pH dependence on the decarboxylation reaction.Since the active site residues of CHS are conserved among CHS-like PKS, including 2-pyrone synthase (18Helaruitta Y. Kotilainen M. Elomaa P. Kalkkinen N. Bremer K. Teeri T.H. Albert V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9033-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), stilbene synthase (19Schröder G. Brown J.W.S. Schröder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), bibenzyl synthase (20Preisig-Müller R. Gnau P. Kindl H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), acridone synthase (21Junghanns K.T. Kneusel R.E. Baumert A. Maier W. Groger D. Matern U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the rppA CHS-like protein (22Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), these enzymes likely retain a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair at their active sites. In addition, homology of the CHS active site residues with those of the FAS and other PKS (44Siggaard-Andersen M. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1993; 5: 325-335Google Scholar), such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase and actinorhodin synthase, suggests that a similar ion pair may be a defining feature in these enzymes.Functional studies of FAS II and III demonstrate that the role of the catalytic cysteine in these enzymes is identical to that of Cys164 in CHS (45Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Lindqvist Y. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11643-11650Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 46Abbadi A. Brummel M. Schutt B.S. Slabaugh M.B. Schuch R. Spener F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the rapid inactivation of FAS by iodoacetamide implies that the active site thiol is highly reactive (47Oesterhelt D. Bauer H. Kresze G.-B. Steber L. Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 79: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 48Stoops J.K. Henry S.J. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12482-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although studies on FAS III demonstrate the importance of the active site histidine in the overall reaction mechanism (42Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 46Abbadi A. Brummel M. Schutt B.S. Slabaugh M.B. Schuch R. Spener F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of this residue on the pKa of the catalytic cysteine in FAS has not been evaluated. Currently, no detailed structural information is available on the modular or heterodimeric iterative PKS, but mechanistic analysis of actinorhodin synthase suggests that a cysteine-histidine dyad is an essential catalytic component (49Dreier J. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2088-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the reaction mechanism of actinorhodin synthase, a cysteine (Cys169) serves as the attachment point for the polyketide chain (49Dreier J. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2088-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 50Kim E.-S. Cramer K.D. Shreve A.L. Sherman D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51He M. Varoglu M. Sherman D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and a histidine (His346) may activate the thiol in the loading and elongation reactions.Stabilization of negatively charged thiolates by imidazolium ions at the active sites of PKS eliminates the need for formal proton transfers such as those governed by general acid-base catalysis. Intuitively, the catalytic advantage of this mechanistic model may derive from limiting bond making and bond breaking steps to thioester formation and breakdown without additional proton transfers to and from the thiolate and imidazolium ions and their respective acids and bases. Polyketide synthases (PKS)1 from bacteria, fungi, and plants produce an array of natural products (1Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 23: 37-66Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hopwood D.A.

Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Many polyketides possess pharmacological properties and are used as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-cancer agents, and anti-fungal agents (5Hutchinson C.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Bentley R. Bennett J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 411-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Despite the structural complexity of these compounds, a common chemical strategy underlies the biosynthetic mechanisms of different PKS. The initial reaction step involves loading a starter molecule onto an active site cysteine through an acyltransferase activity. Following formation of the primed acyl-enzyme complex, a decarboxylative condensation reaction extends the reaction intermediate. The elongation step can be repeated until an appropriate chain length is reached and the reaction product released. This process is analogous to the reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthases (FAS) (7Wakil R.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Recent structural and kinetic studies of chalcone synthase (CHS), a plant-specific PKS, have elucidated the basis of polyketide formation in plants and provide a model for understanding the reaction mechanism of other PKS. Unlike the modular PKS, such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase, which are large protein assemblies with distinct active sites that catalyze each elongation step (1Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu.

CHS uses p-coumaroyl-CoA as a starter molecule and three malonyl-CoA extender molecules to form a tetraketide intermediate that is cyclized into 4,2′,4′,6′-tetrahydroxychalcone (chalcone) (Fig. 1 a) (9Kreuzaler F.

This intraarticular inflammatory response in OA-affected cartilage, which may be considered as an in situ “molecular inflammation,” is partially dependent on autocrine IL-1β production, which induces and sustains an imbalance of cartilage homeostasis and extracellular matrix synthesis (5Attur M.G. Dave M.N. Clancy R.M. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The autocrine production of IL-1 in OA-affected cartilage is amplified by engagement of integrins such as α5β1 by abnormally expressed extracellular matrix proteins, including proteolytic fragments of fibronectin (5Attur M.G. Dave M.N. Clancy R.M. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Homandberg G.A. Frontiers Biosci. 1999; 4: D713-D730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure of articular tissue to IL-1β can provoke a variety of cellular and inflammatory responses. For example, constitutive intraarticular expression of an adenoviral IL-1β transgene in rabbit joints induces multiple intraarticular manifestations, which include intense inflammation, leukocytosis, synovial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, highly aggressive pannus formation, and erosion of articular cartilage and bone. It also induces systemic effects including diarrhea and fever. Following the loss of the IL-1β transgene, which occurs after 28 days, most of the pathophysiological symptoms described above regress within 4 weeks (7Ghivizzani S.C. Kang R. Georgescu H.I. Lechman E.R. Jaffurs D. Engle J.M. Watkins S.C. Tindal M.H. Suchanek M.K. McKenzie L.R. Evans C.H. Robbins P.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3604-3612PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the pathophysiological effects of IL-1β in the local and systemic environment are reversible. The effects of IL-1 are not limited to inflammation, as bone formation, insulin secretion, appetite regulation, fever induction, and neuronal phenotype development are also regulated by this cytokine (8Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1991; 77: 1627-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The action of IL-1 requires signaling through the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-1 type I receptor, which associates with a receptor accessory protein, IL-1RAcp. In vivo, the action of IL-1 is attenuated by at least two endogenous antagonists, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), a naturally occurring IL-1 inhibitor that binds to IL-1R without inducing biological responses (8Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1991; 77: 1627-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the non-signaling type II IL-1 receptor (IL-1RII), which is devoid of a cytoplasmic domain and serves as a decoy, or activity down-modulating, receptor (9Colotta F. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Mantovani A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 562-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In view of this background, we performed studies that examined the relative expression of IL-1 and associated proteins in OA and normal articular cartilage. We sought to determine whether an imbalance exists between signaling and inhibitory molecules that could favor the unchecked catabolic action of IL-1 in cartilage. We also examined the question of whether pharmacological intervention using the decoy IL-1RII receptor could reverse the catabolic events involved in OA cartilage degradation. The data indicate that future therapeutic strategies in osteoarthritis could involve restoring deficient IL-1 antagonists in diseased tissue. All media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cytokines and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit synovial (HIG 82), human epithelial (A549) and HEK293 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). SV40 T antigen-immortalized C-20/A4 chondrocytes, originally derived from human juvenile costal cartilage, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS (10Goldring M.B.

The released cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS + antibiotics and plated in a 24-well plate (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/2.0 cm2 for 48 h. Human chondrocytes were isolated from OA-affected cartilage. The cartilage was cut into small pieces and digested with Pronase (0.1%) for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by digestion with collagenase P (0.1%) for 12–16 h in Ham's F-12 medium (12Attur M.G.

Organ culture was carried out as described previously (11Amin A.R. Attur M.G. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J. Rediske J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin.

Briefly, knee articular cartilage from patients undergoing knee replacement surgery was obtained and cut in 3-mm discs, and four to six discs (∼100 mg) were placed in organ culture in 2 ml of Ham's F-12 medium + 0.1% human albumin for 24 -72 h, with or without modulators. The medium was analyzed for nitric oxide (NO) as nitrite release and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (13Attur M.G. Patel I.R. Patel R.N. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1998; 110: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar) (radioimmunoassay, Sigma). Bovine or human chondrocytes were immobilized in alginate beads according to the method of Hauselmann et al. (14Hauselmann H.J. Aydelotte M.B. Schumacher B.L. Kuettner K.E. Gitelis S.H. Thonar E.J. Matrix. 1992; 12: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in filter-sterilized, low viscosity alginate solution (1.2%) at a concentration of 6 × 106 cells/ml and slowly passed through a 22-gauge needle into a 102 mm CaCl2solution. After instantaneous gelation, the beads were further allowed to polymerize for 10 min in CaCl2 solution. After two washes in 0.15 m NaCl and one wash in Ham's F-12 medium (supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin and streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), heat-inactivated FBS (10%) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ascorbic acid (25 μg/ml)), the beads (5 beads/well; 40,000 cells/bead) were finally incubated in complete culture medium for 6 days in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C before further experiments. Synovial cells were retrieved from joints of patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. The cells were released and cultivated as described (15Crofford L.J. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24 Suppl. 49: 15-19Google Scholar) in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were also stained for the presence of type B (fibroblast-like) synovial cells using anti-fibronectin antibody (anti-CD68). Chondrocytes immobilized in alginate beads were incubated in Ham's F-12 culture medium (supplemented withl-glutamine (2 mm), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml), heat-inactivated FBS (0.5%), ascorbic acid (25 μg/ml)) with 10 μCi/ml sodium sulfate (Na235SO4) for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Alginate beads were washed five times with 0.15 m NaCl and solubilized in 0.5 ml of Soluene 350 (Packard) in scintillation counting tubes. After addition of 4.5 ml of liquid scintillation counting fluid (Hionic Fluor, Packard), the [35S]-labeled proteoglycan content was measured using a Beckman LS 7000 counter and normalized with total genomic DNA content of the cells. The method was basically as described by Adams et al. (16Adams M.E. Huang D.Q. Yao L.Y. Sandell L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (11Amin A.R. Attur M.G. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J. Rediske J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cartilage was milled into fine powder in liquid nitrogen and was extracted with 4 m guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sarcosine, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol for 4 h on a rocker. It was then extracted with water-saturated phenol, followed by phenol and chloroform. The aqueous phase was layered onto a cesium trifluoroacetate gradient for ultracentrifugation (24,000 rpm/24 h). The RNA pellet was dissolved in guanidium thiocyanate and precipitated with alcohol in the presence of acetic acid. The cells from the calcium alginate beads were released as previously reported (14Hauselmann H.J. Aydelotte M.B. Schumacher B.L. Kuettner K.E. Gitelis S.H. Thonar E.J. Matrix. 1992; 12: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp kit (Qiagen Inc. Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacture and estimated at 260/280 nm using a spectrophotometer (Beckman). Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (MRC Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Briefly, 20 μg of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. RNA from the gel was then transferred by capillary action onto a nylon membrane (Zeta Probe, Bio-Rad). The membrane was hybridized with [32P]dATP-labeled full length human IL-1RII cDNA or IL-1β cDNA. After hybridization, the blot was exposed to Kodak x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 24–48 h with intensifying screens at −70 °C. A human cytokine expression array (catalog no. GA001) from R&D Systems was used for this study. Total RNA was isolated from four normal and four OA cartilage samples, as described above. Equal amounts of RNA from each normal and OA cartilage sample were pooled separately. cDNA labeling reactions were performed using [α-33P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by R&D Systems. Labeled cDNA using both cytokine-specific primers and oligo(dT) primers were pooled and hybridized with expression array blot as recommended by the manufacturer. PBMCs were isolated from heparanized human blood using a Ficoll gradient as described previously (17Amin A.R. Attur M.G. Vyas P. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Levartovsky D. Rediske J. Clancy R.M. Vora K.A. Abramson S.B. J. Inflamm. 1997; 47: 190-205Google Scholar). The buffy layer of cells was stimulated with LPS in RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS. The full-length cDNA for type II IL-1R was amplified using PCR primers, cloned, and expressed in the C-20/A4 chondrocytes after stable transfection of a mammalian expression vector pCB7 coding for hygromycin resistance as reported previously (5Attur M.G. Dave M.N. Clancy R.M. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A clone, designated C-20/A4 IL-1RII+, was isolated after hygromycin selection. PGE2 was determined in the culture supernatant using a radioimmunoassay, as reported previously (11Amin A.R. Attur M.G. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J. Rediske J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), with a detection limit of 1.0 pg/ml. NO production was measured by estimating the stable NO metabolite, nitrite, in conditioned medium by a modified Griess reaction (11Amin A.R. Attur M.G. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J. Rediske J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The values were expressed as micromolar nitrite or nanograms per milliliter PGE2released per 100 mg wet weight of cartilage or 5 × 105 chondrocytes. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Each value is the mean of at least three samples. The results were analyzed by Student's t test. Differences withp < 0.05 were considered as significant. We and others observed previously that human OA-affected cartilage (but not normal cartilage) produced IL-1 in an autocrine fashion, which regulates the production of other inflammatory mediators (1Amin A.R. Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Amin A.R. Attur M.G. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J. Rediske J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997; 5: 293-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This regulation was also dependent on the concentration of the IL-1 antagonizing molecules, IL-1ra and IL-1RII, which can also exist in soluble forms together with sIL-1RI. We therefore analyzed the expression of mRNA encoding members of the IL-1 receptor family in human normal and OA cartilage that regulate IL-1 signaling and responses. Total RNA was extracted from four normal and four OA cartilage samples. Equal amounts of RNA from each sample were pooled together as either normal or OA RNA and labeled, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A nylon membrane representing specific DNA oligonucleotide sequences, including those for IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), IL-1RI, IL-1RII, and IL-1ra, was probed with the RNA from either normal or OA cartilage (Fig. 1 A). The signals were normalized against the housekeeping genes, GAPDH and β-actin. Both normal and OA cartilage showed a relatively high expression of IL-RAcP and IL-1RI mRNA, whose translated protein receptors are prerequisite for signal transduction of IL-1 family proteins (19O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The mRNA analysis of normal and OA cartilage samples did not show detectable signals above background for IL-1ra and IL-1RII. In view of the role of IL-1 in the pathophysiology of human osteoarthritis, we examined the ability of sIL-1RII and membrane IL-1RII (mIL-1RII) to attenuate IL-1-induced effects in chondrocytes, cartilage, and synovial cells. We examined the expression of IL-1RII by reverse transcription-PCR in RNA obtained from human normal and OA-affected cartilage obtained from eight different patients (of which three are represented) in Fig. 1 B (panel a) in synovial cells, A549 epithelial, and HEK293 cells (transfected or not with IL-1RII cDNA). As observed with the cartilage samples, human epithelial and synovial cells also did not show expression of IL-1RII mRNA. However, HEK293 cells transfected with IL-1RII cDNA showed expression of IL-1RII. The above observations led us to examine the role of IL-1RII in chondrocyte function. We selected an immortalized human chondrocyte cell line (C-20/A4) for the present study, as these cells do not release NO or PGE2 in the presence or absence of IL-1 (data not shown). Human IL-1RII cDNA was transfected in C-20/A4 cells, and a clone, C-20/A4 IL-1RII+, that stably expressed IL-1RII was isolated after hygromycin selection. Northern blot analysis of nontransfected C-20/A4 cells did not express detectable amounts of IL-1RII+ mRNA similar to normal and OA cartilage (Fig. 2). However, C-20/A4 IL-1RII+ cells expressed significant levels of IL-1RII mRNA, similar to LPS-stimulated PBMC (20Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). C-20/A4 and C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells were stained with anti-αvβ3 integrin (CD51 and CD61 complex) antibodies and anti-IL-1RII antibodies. As expected, C-20/A4 and C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells showed similar expression of αvβ3 integrin, and there was a significant expression of IL-1RII on the cell surface of C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells as compared with nontransfected cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3Expression of IL-1RII on the cell surface of C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells. C-20/A4 and C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells were stained with anti-αvβ3 mAb followed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. Similarly, the cells were stained with anti-IL-1RII mAb (M25) followed with phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody. The non-transfected (C-20/A4) cells were viewed under a non-fluorescent light (magnification, ×20). One of the several representative cells is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also analyzed the production of soluble IL-1RII in C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C-20/A4IL-1RII+ (106) cells released approximately 3 ng/ml recombinant IL-1RII (as compared with ≤1 pg/ml in nontransfected C-20/A4 cells) in 72 h. These experiments show that C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells express both cell surface and soluble IL-1RII. The biological activity of the recombinant soluble IL-1RII was tested both in bovine and OA chondrocytes, which are known to respond to human IL-1β (21Clancy R.M. Abramson S.B. Kohne C. Rediske J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Bovine and human chondrocytes grown in monolayers were stimulated with human IL-1β in the presence of supernatants from C-20/A4 and C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells, which contained 500 pg/ml human soluble recombinant IL-1RII, and commercially available, purified sIL-1RII from R&D Systems. An equivalent amount of total protein from C-20/A4 control supernatant (constituting mostly serum albumin) was added accordingly. Both IL-1RII preparations at similar concentrations had the ability to block IL-1β-induced NO and PGE2production by ≥80% in both cell types (Fig. 4, A and B). The biological activities of the commercial source of sIL-1RII and chondrocyte-derived sIL-1RII were similar. There was no detectable IL-1RII in the supernatants of nontransfected C-20/A4 cells. All of the subsequent experiments were performed with the chondrocyte-derived sIL-1RII, unless otherwise specified. The specificity of the effects of IL-1 and the neutralizing activity of sIL-1RII were examined in primary bovine chondrocytes, which respond to both recombinant human IL-1β and TNFα with respect to induction of NO. Ten ng/ml human IL-1β increased NO, which was significantly inhibited in dose-dependent (0.5–1.5 ng/ml) fashion by soluble IL-1RII; in contrast, IL-1-induced NO production was not inhibited by up to 25 μg/ml soluble p75 TNFα receptor fused to Fc region of Ig (TNFR:Fc) (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, 1000 units/ml TNFα induced NO production, which could be inhibited by more than 90% by 25 μg/ml TNFR:Fc, but not by 1 ng/ml IL-1RII, a concentration sufficient to block IL-1-dependent responses in the cells (Fig. 4 C). These experiments indicate that the inhibitory effects of soluble IL-1RII are specific to IL-1 stimulation and are not related to activation by different ligands (e.g. TNFα). Primary chondrocytes, when grown in monolayer for even 1 week, show significant loss of chondrocyte phenotype and dedifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells (22Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. MacCallum D.K. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 19: 277-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Therefore, bovine and human chondrocytes were immobilized in alginate beads to avoid dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. IL-1β has been reported to inhibit proteoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes in relatively long term cultures of about 3 days (23Hauselmann H.J. Fernandes R.J. Mok S.S. Schmid T.M. Block J.A. Aydelotte M.B. Kuettner K.E. Thonar E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 17-27PubMed Google Scholar). The immobilized human and bovine cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml human IL-1β in the absence and presence of various concentrations of sIL-1RII. IL-1-stimulated cells produced NO at 72 h, which could be inhibited by >50% with 250 and 500 pg/ml sIL-1RII (Fig. 5). At the same time point, IL-1β significantly inhibited the incorporation of [35S]sulfates into proteoglycans in immobilized bovine and human chondrocytes as compared with uninduced cells (p < 0.01). IL-1RII at 500 pg/ml, but not at 250 pg/ml, significantly reversed the effect of IL-1 on proteoglycan synthesis. IL-1RII at 1 ng/ml completely blocked the actions of IL-1. These experiments suggested that the synthesis of proteoglycan was equally sensitive to the effects of sIL-1RII as compared with NO production. These experiments also showed that relatively low levels of sIL-1RII were sufficient to significantly block the effects of IL-1 in both bovine and human chondrocytes. We also examined the expression of IL-1RII in permanently transfected human chondrocytes in alginate beads and monolayer cultures. C-20/A4IL-1RII+cells (4 × 104) in monolayer cultures released 50 ± 4.1 pg/ml (n = 6) of IL-1RII in 72 h. A similar number of cells (4 × 104), when immobilized in alginate beads in a parallel experiment, showed 20 ± 3.0 pg/ml (n = 6) within the same time period. These experiments suggested that immobilization of chondrocytes decreased the expression of sIL-1RII. We compared the regulation of proteoglycan synthesis by IL-1 in immobilized cultures of C-20/A4 and C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells. As immobilized C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells make low amounts of sIL-1RII, we chose to stimulate the cells with a low concentration (0.5 ng/ml) of IL-1. Addition of IL-1 to C-20/A4 cells showed a significant decrease (23%) in the incorporation of [35S]sulfates into the proteoglycans as compared with noninduced cells. However, stimulation of C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells with 0.5 ng of IL-1 showed no significant decrease in proteoglycan synthesis under similar experimental conditions. Increasing the concentration of IL-1 to 1 ng/ml showed a significant decrease in proteoglycan synthesis in both C-20/A4 and C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells (Fig. 6). The susceptibility of chondrocytes to IL-1 is directly dependent on the amount of IL-1 and IL-1RII. Recent studies have shown that production of inflammatory mediators such as NO, PGE2, IL-6, and matrix metaloproteinase in chondrocytes is induced by autocrine IL-1(5, 13, 24). In view of these observations, we examined the induction of IL-1 mRNA by relatively high concentrations of IL-1 (5–10 ng/ml) in nontransfected and IL-1RII-transfected cells that expressed membrane IL-1RII and also released sIL-1RII. C-20/A4 and C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells (106) were exposed to 5–10 ng/ml IL-1 for 4 h and analyzed for IL-1 mRNA by Northern analysis (Fig. 7). IL-1 induced IL-1 mRNA in C-20/A4 cells, however, there was no detectable expression of IL-1 mRNA in C-20/A4IL-1RII+ cells, even at concentrations of IL-1 as high as 10 ng/ml. These experiments suggest that transgene expression of IL-1RII inhibits the induction of IL-1 mRNA and probably the autocrine production of IL-1. Based on the above observations, the ability of IL-1RI and IL-1RII to inhibit the spontaneous production of NO and PGE2 by autocrine IL-1 was compared under identical conditions. IL-1RI (1 mg/ml) has been reported previously to inhibit the spontaneous production of NO and PGE2 by ∼50% in human OA-affected cartilage in ex vivo (13Attur M.G. Patel I.R. Patel R.N. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1998; 110: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, the IC50 required to inhibit NO accumulation in OA-affected cartilage was 1 mg/ml for IL-1RI and 125 pg/ml for IL-1RII (Fig. 8). These experiments suggested that sIL-1RII was more effective than sIL-1RI in neutralizing the action of endogenous autocrine IL-1 in OA cartilage. Human OA cartilage was also incubated in basal F12 media in ex vivo conditions to examine the effect of sIL-1RII on the effects of exogenously added IL-1. The human OA cartilage cultures spontaneously released NO and PGE2, which was further augmented by addition of IL-1, as previously reported. Increasing concentrations of sIL-1RII receptor showed a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous production of NO and PGE2 as shown above and in Table I. Addition of 1 ng/ml IL-1 to these cartilage cultures resulted i"
https://openalex.org/W2013541197,"Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is a multisubunit serine/threonine phosphatase involved in intracellular signaling, gene regulation, and cell cycle progression. Different subunits of PP2A bind to Axin and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, components of the Wnt signal transduction pathway. Using early Xenopusembryos, we studied how PP2A functions in Wnt signal transduction. The catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2A-C) potentiated secondary axis induction and Siamois reporter gene activation by Dishevelled, a component of the Wnt pathway, indicating a positive regulatory role of this enzyme in Wnt signaling. In contrast, small t antigen, an antagonist of PP2A-C, inhibited Dishevelled-mediated signal transduction, as did the regulatory PP2A-B′ε subunit, consistent with the requirement of PP2A function in this pathway. Although Wnt signaling is thought to occur via regulation of β−catenin degradation, PP2A-C did not significantly affect β−catenin stability. Moreover, the pathway activated by a stabilized form of β−catenin was sensitive to PP2A-C and its inhibitors, suggesting that PP2A-C acts downstream of β-catenin. Because previous work has suggested that PP2A can act upstream of β-catenin, we propose that PP2A regulates the Wnt pathway at multiple levels. Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is a multisubunit serine/threonine phosphatase involved in intracellular signaling, gene regulation, and cell cycle progression. Different subunits of PP2A bind to Axin and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, components of the Wnt signal transduction pathway. Using early Xenopusembryos, we studied how PP2A functions in Wnt signal transduction. The catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2A-C) potentiated secondary axis induction and Siamois reporter gene activation by Dishevelled, a component of the Wnt pathway, indicating a positive regulatory role of this enzyme in Wnt signaling. In contrast, small t antigen, an antagonist of PP2A-C, inhibited Dishevelled-mediated signal transduction, as did the regulatory PP2A-B′ε subunit, consistent with the requirement of PP2A function in this pathway. Although Wnt signaling is thought to occur via regulation of β−catenin degradation, PP2A-C did not significantly affect β−catenin stability. Moreover, the pathway activated by a stabilized form of β−catenin was sensitive to PP2A-C and its inhibitors, suggesting that PP2A-C acts downstream of β-catenin. Because previous work has suggested that PP2A can act upstream of β-catenin, we propose that PP2A regulates the Wnt pathway at multiple levels. glycogen synthase kinase protein phosphatase-2A dominant negative small t antigen adenomatous polyposis coli luciferase Xenopus The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins regulates many biological processes including cell growth, cell polarity, and tissue specification (1Cadigan K.M.

Furthermore, inhibition of downstream Wnt signaling suppresses the formation of the primary axis (5Heasman J. Crawford A. Goldstone K. Garner-Hamrick P. Gumbiner B. McCrea P. Kintner C.

Thus, activation of the Wnt pathway plays a key role in dorsal axis development in vertebrates.Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified many components of the Wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathway. Wnts bind to transmembrane Frizzled receptors, which leads to activation of the cytoplasmic Dsh (Dishevelled) protein (7He X. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Wang Y. Nathans J. Dawid I. Varmus H.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin within this complex is phosphorylated by GSK-3, and this leads to its rapid degradation via the ubiquitin pathway (17Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). In response to Wnt signals, β-catenin is no longer targeted for degradation and accumulates to high levels in the cytoplasm (18Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T.

This stabilized β-catenin enters the nucleus and, complexed with transcription factors of the Lef-1/Tcf family, promotes the transcription of target genes (19Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Regulation of phosphorylation is likely to play an important role, because Dsh, Axin, APC, GSK-3, and β-catenin are all phosphoproteins. The serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A has a wide range of substrates and is important in many cellular processes. It comprises a regulatory A subunit, a catalytic C subunit, and variable regulatory B subunits, which may target the location and/or action of the holoenzyme (22Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 23Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol.

Mouse embryos lacking thePP2A-Cα gene die 6.5 days post coitum, indicating that PP2A has a critical function during early development (25Götz J. Probst A. Ehler E. Hemmings B. Kues W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12370-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PP2A-C was shown to bind to Axin (15Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), whereas regulatory subunits of the PP2A-B′ family can interact with APC (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Also, PP2A can promote dephosphorylation of both APC and Axin (27Ikeda S. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Usui H. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the PP2A-B′ε subunit causes a decrease in levels of β-catenin in mammalian tissue culture cells (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although these observations indicate that PP2A may regulate β-catenin degradation, the specific role of the catalytic subunit and the function of the holoenzyme in the Wnt pathway remain unclear.We have used microinjection assays in Xenopus laevis to probe the action of PP2A in Wnt signaling. We show that PP2A-C is a necessary positive component of Wnt signaling in Xenopus. Unexpectedly, we find that PP2A can act downstream or parallel to β-catenin, and it may serve to activate Tcf transcription factors. Because PP2A has also been shown to act upstream of β-catenin, we propose that this enzyme regulates the Wnt pathway at multiple levels.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we show that PP2A plays a positive role in Wnt signal transduction. Coinjection of the catalytic subunit potentiates signaling by Xdsh, as assayed by the ability of Xdsh to induce a secondary axis or activate a Siamois-luciferase reporter. Inhibition of endogenous PP2A-C by small t antigen blocks the ability of Xdsh to activate Siamois, demonstrating that PP2A-C is required for Wnt signal transduction. These findings are unexpected, because previously published data suggested that PP2A-C might be an inhibitor of the pathway in mammalian cells (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).The PP2A-B′ε regulatory subunit of PP2A has been shown to bind to APC and is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We isolated a highly conserved Xenopus homologue of PP2A-B′ε using a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with Xdsh. However, we were unable to demonstrate binding of PP2A-B′ε to Xdsh in embryo lysates, suggesting that the binding may be weak or transient. Consistent with the earlier report (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), our data show that PP2A-B′ε inhibits axis induction by Xdsh. Thus, the PP2A-B′ε subunit acts in an opposite manner to the catalytic subunit and is likely to function as an antagonist of PP2A-C. Our in vivo experiments support biochemical studies in which the presence of certain regulatory B subunits was correlated with reduced activity of the enzyme (40Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Slaughter C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13251-13260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,41Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Lickteig R.L. Yang S.I. Craft C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20139-20148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In mammalian tissue culture cells, Myc-β-catenin levels are increased by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A-C (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In our experiments we did not observe a significant change in the stability of β-catenin in response to PP2A-C or Smt, whereas β-catenin was clearly stabilized by dominant negative GSK-3 (Fig. 3 A). The assay we used may not be sufficiently sensitive. It is also possible that PP2A may behave differently in mammalian and Xenopus systems. Such differences in the Wnt pathway have been previously documented for APC, a potential PP2A substrate that inhibits Wnt signaling in mouse cells (46Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) but activates the same pathway in Xenopus embryos (47Vleminckx K. Wong E. Guger K. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Because PP2A had no discernable effect on β-catenin stability in our experiments, we tested whether this phosphatase functions downstream of β-catenin. We found that target gene activation by stabilized β-catenin is potentiated by PP2A-C and blocked by Smt. Therefore, PP2A can regulate the pathway via a mechanism independent of β−catenin stabilization.We next tested the possibility that PP2A acts at the level of Tcfs, which are necessary downstream components of Wnt signal transduction. Tcfs function as transcriptional repressors (29Fan M.J. Gruning W. Walz G. Sokol S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5626-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 45Brannon M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2359-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), but they can be converted into activators of Wnt target genes when complexed with β-catenin (19Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

In Xenopus, overexpression of XTcf-3 represses endogenous Wnt signaling in the dorsal marginal zone (45Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that XTcf-3 suppressed signaling by Xdsh or β-catenin (Fig. 4 and data not shown). However, upon coinjection of XTcf-3 and PP2A-C, a Siamois reporter construct was markedly activated (Fig. 4). This result suggests that PP2A-C can promote the conversion of XTcf-3 from a repressor to an activator. We propose that endogenous PP2A-C levels are insufficient for activation of overexpressed XTcf-3, which therefore behaves as a repressor of Wnt signaling. However, when PP2A-C is provided in excess, XTcf-3 now behaves as a transcriptional activator. XTcf-3 is known to bind corepressor molecules such as C-terminal binding protein (45Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Groucho (50Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destrée O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and signaling by PP2A-C might relieve this repression. Although XTcf-3 may be a direct substrate for PP2A, it is also possible that one of the many pathways involving PP2A could integrate with Wnt signaling downstream of β-catenin. These possibilities remain to be tested by future studies. The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins regulates many biological processes including cell growth, cell polarity, and tissue specification (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

In our experiments we did not observe a significant change in the stability of β-catenin in response to PP2A-C or Smt, whereas β-catenin was clearly stabilized by dominant negative GSK-3 (Fig. 3 A). The assay we used may not be sufficiently sensitive. It is also possible that PP2A may behave differently in mammalian and Xenopus systems. Such differences in the Wnt pathway have been previously documented for APC, a potential PP2A substrate that inhibits Wnt signaling in mouse cells (46Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) but activates the same pathway in Xenopus embryos (47Vleminckx K. Wong E. Guger K. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Because PP2A had no discernable effect on β-catenin stability in our experiments, we tested whether this phosphatase functions downstream of β-catenin. We found that target gene activation by stabilized β-catenin is potentiated by PP2A-C and blocked by Smt. Therefore, PP2A can regulate the pathway via a mechanism independent of β−catenin stabilization.We next tested the possibility that PP2A acts at the level of Tcfs, which are necessary downstream components of Wnt signal transduction. Tcfs function as transcriptional repressors (29Fan M.J. Gruning W. Walz G. Sokol S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5626-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 45Brannon M.

In Xenopus, overexpression of XTcf-3 represses endogenous Wnt signaling in the dorsal marginal zone (45Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that XTcf-3 suppressed signaling by Xdsh or β-catenin (Fig. 4 and data not shown). However, upon coinjection of XTcf-3 and PP2A-C, a Siamois reporter construct was markedly activated (Fig. 4). This result suggests that PP2A-C can promote the conversion of XTcf-3 from a repressor to an activator. We propose that endogenous PP2A-C levels are insufficient for activation of overexpressed XTcf-3, which therefore behaves as a repressor of Wnt signaling. However, when PP2A-C is provided in excess, XTcf-3 now behaves as a transcriptional activator. XTcf-3 is known to bind corepressor molecules such as C-terminal binding protein (45Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Groucho (50Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destrée O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and signaling by PP2A-C might relieve this repression. Although XTcf-3 may be a direct substrate for PP2A, it is also possible that one of the many pathways involving PP2A could integrate with Wnt signaling downstream of β-catenin. These possibilities remain to be tested by future studies. In this report, we show that PP2A plays a positive role in Wnt signal transduction. Coinjection of the catalytic subunit potentiates signaling by Xdsh, as assayed by the ability of Xdsh to induce a secondary axis or activate a Siamois-luciferase reporter. Inhibition of endogenous PP2A-C by small t antigen blocks the ability of Xdsh to activate Siamois, demonstrating that PP2A-C is required for Wnt signal transduction. These findings are unexpected, because previously published data suggested that PP2A-C might be an inhibitor of the pathway in mammalian cells (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The PP2A-B′ε regulatory subunit of PP2A has been shown to bind to APC and is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We isolated a highly conserved Xenopus homologue of PP2A-B′ε using a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with Xdsh. However, we were unable to demonstrate binding of PP2A-B′ε to Xdsh in embryo lysates, suggesting that the binding may be weak or transient. Consistent with the earlier report (26Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), our data show that PP2A-B′ε inhibits axis induction by Xdsh. Thus, the PP2A-B′ε subunit acts in an opposite manner to the catalytic subunit and is likely to function as an antagonist of PP2A-C. Our in vivo experiments support biochemical studies in which the presence of certain regulatory B subunits was correlated with reduced activity of the enzyme (40Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Slaughter C.

Recombinant NCS-1(E120Q) showed an impaired Ca2+-dependent conformational change but could still bind to cellular proteins. Transient expression of this mutant, but not NCS-1, in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells increased non-L-type Ca2+ channel currents.

The functional roles of the neuronally expressed members of the family are generally unknown but there are some clues as to the function of NCS-1.

The basis of its effect on exocytosis is not known nor is it known whether it has other physiological functions. It is known, however, that multiple binding targets for NCS-1 can be detected in biochemical assays (12Schaad N.C. De Castro E. Nef S. Hegi S. Hinrichsen R. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H. Sikkink R.

Surprisingly, a yeast frequenin exists which is essential for viability due to its requirement as a stimulator of PIK1, a yeast phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase (14Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nature Cell Biology. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The targets and functions of other neuronal members of this family are less well known. The enhancement of exocytosis due to overexpression of NCS-1 in PC12 cells was observed in intact cells following stimulation with the purinergic agonist ATP but not in digitonin-permeabilized cells when exocytosis was directly stimulated by Ca2+ (11McFerran B.W.

These data suggest an indirect effect of NCS-1 on the regulation of exocytosis perhaps due to changes in receptors, channel function, or Ca2+ signaling. The first observed phenotype due to overexpression of frequenin inDrosophila was a neurotransmission abnormality (15Tanouye M.A. Ferrus A. Fujita S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6548-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reminiscent of the consequences of K+ channel dysfunction in shaker mutants due to mutations in K+ channel subunits. Recent work has demonstrated that calmodulin is a constitutive subunit and Ca2+-dependent regulator of both voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (16Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.Y. Reuter H.

It is not known whether NCS-1 or related family members regulate channel function but the more distant KChIP Ca2+-binding proteins have recently been found to be required for normal activity of A-type K+ channels (21An W.F.

The aims of this project were 2-fold. First, to develop a novel EF-hand mutant of NCS-1 as a dominant inhibitor of NCS-1 function. Second, to further resolve the cellular functions of NCS-1. We have investigated its role in the regulation of Ca2+ currents in adrenal chromaffin cells and from the use of an EF-hand mutant we establish that NCS-1 acts in a physiological pathway for negative regulation of voltage-activated Ca2+channels. Plasmids encoding wild-type NCS-1 for protein expression (pET-5a/NCS-1) or in pcDNA3.1 for transfection (pNCS-1) were described previously (11McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

Plasmids encoding NCS-1(E120Q) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikchangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The sense and antisense primers used for mutagenesis (with changes underlined) and with a unique AccI restriction site were: 5′-CACCAGAAACCAGATGCTGGACATAGTCGACGCCATTTACC-3′ and 5′-GGTAAATGGCGTCGACTATGTCCAGCATCTGGTTTCTGGTG-3′, respectively. Plasmid sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. BL21(DE3) cells (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom) were transformed with pBB131 (25Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J.

Expression of both recombinant NCS-1 and NMT was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml myristate. Cells were harvested, lysed, and recombinant NCS-1 or NCS-1(E120Q) purified as described previously (13McFerran B.W. Weiss J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

For mass spectroscopy analysis, protein was concentrated using Nanosep 10K centrifugal concentrators (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Portsmouth, UK) and dialyzed against distilled H2O with Slide-A-LyzerTM 10K dialysis cassettes (Pierce and Warriner, Chester, UK). NCS-1 and NCS-1(E120Q) were biotinylated and used to probe immobilized adrenal membrane and cytosol fractions on nitrocellulose blots in the presence of 10 μm free Ca2+ as described previously (13McFerran B.W.

Samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were dissolved in sample buffer (125 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 1.25% SDS (w/v), 2 mmEDTA, 10% sucrose (w/v), 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 0.001% bromphenol blue), boiled, and separated on a 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For experiments investigating changes in protein conformation, samples were prepared in non-denaturing sample buffer (50 mm Trizma base, 10% glycerol, 10% sucrose, 0.001% bromphenol blue, pH 7.5, with either 10 mm EGTA or 10 mm CaCl2), boiled, and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the absence of SDS.

The following day non-attached cells were harvested by centrifugation, re-suspended in growth medium at a density of 1 × 107/ml and 20 μg of pEGFP (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, UK) in combination with 20 μg of pDNA3.1 (control cells), pNCS-1, or pNCS-1(E120Q) was added per ml of cells. Cells and plasmids were electroporated at 250 V and 975 microfarads for one pulse, using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) and 4-mm cuvettes. Cells were diluted as rapidly as possible to 1 × 106/ml with fresh growth media and 1 × 106 cells grown on 35-mm Petri dishes in a final volume of 3 ml of growth medium for a further 3–5 days. Transfections were performed as above except that the cells were plated onto round glass coverslips (13 mm diameter). Afer washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min in PBT, and incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-NCS-1 (11McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

After washing three times in PBT, cells were incubated for 1 h in biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1/100 in PBT, washed three times with PBT, and finally incubated in streptavidin/Texas Red (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1/50 dilution in PBT for 30 min. The cells were viewed with the appropriate filters for GPF fluorescence and immunofluorescence. Adrenal chromaffin cells grown on 35-mm plastic dishes were washed and maintained in external bath solution. For recording of Ca2+ channel currents (23Twitchell W.A. Rane S.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 701-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this contained 143 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The intracellular pipette solution contained 150 mm CsCl, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 2 mm BAPTA, 0.5 mm GTP, and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.3. The pipettes used had a resistance of 2.0–4.0 MΩ in the bath solution. Whole cell recording was carried out using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). The cells were held at −60 mV after correction for a liquid junction potential of −8mV and depolarized under the control of PULSE software (HEKA). Capacitance and series resistance were compensated using the EPC-9 correction routines. Series resistance was on average less than 10 MΩ. Current output was filtered at 2.9 KHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter and data acquired and stored at 20-μs intervals. Linear leak and capacity currents were subtracted with a P/4 procedure using PULSE software and traces are the averages of three sweeps. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C) without superfusion during recording. All drug applications were by direct addition to the bath buffer. The recent establishment of calmodulin as a regulator of Ca2+ and K+ channel function has been based on co-expression of channel subunits and calmodulin constructs with inactivating mutations in one or more EF-hands (16Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.Y. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 19Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Yue D.T.

Cahalan M.D. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5746-5754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These mutants act in a dominant negative fashion to block the function of endogenous calmodulin. Such an approach could also work for NCS-1 as it binds to many of its target proteins in a Ca2+-independent manner (13McFerran B.W. Weiss J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NCS-1 possesses four EF-hands with the first N-terminal EF-hand being non-functional (24Cox J.A. Drussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to develop a probe for NCS-1 function, we constructed an EF-hand mutant of NCS-1 with glutamate at position 120 mutated to glutamine (E120Q) in the third EF-hand (Fig. 1 a). This was based on a mutation previously characterized in the related protein neurocalcin δ and shown to impair Ca2+ binding (4Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NCS-1(E120Q) was initially expressed as a recombinant protein and purified as described previously for wild-type NCS-1 (13McFerran B.W. Weiss J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 b). Following co-expression in Escherichia coli withN-myristoyltransferase, both wild-type NCS-1 and NCS-1(E120Q) were N terminally myristoylated to around 20% based on mass spectroscopy. We examined whether NCS-1(E120Q) had an impairment of its Ca2+-dependent function. Ca2+ binding leads to a conformational change in the neuronal Ca2+ sensor proteins which can be assayed as a change in migration during native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of Ca2+ (5Faurobert E. Chen C.K. Hurley J.B. Teng D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10256-10262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Wild-type NCS-1 showed a marked change in migration in native gel electrophoresis in the presence of Ca2+ compared with the presence of EGTA (Fig. 1 c). The change in migration of NCS-1(E120Q) due to Ca2+ was much less than for the wild-type protein. These data show that the E120Q mutation impairs the normal conformational change in NCS-1 occurring upon Ca2+ binding and suggests that this mutant protein is functionally impaired. If NCS-1(E120Q) is to act in a dominant negative manner it would have to be able to bind to target proteins. Using a biotinylated protein overlay technique, previously used to identify target proteins for NCS-1(13), we found that NCS-1(E120Q) binds the same pattern of polypeptides in adrenal membrane and cytosol fractions as seen for NCS-1 (Fig. 1 d). These results suggest that NCS-1(E120Q) expressed in cells could act in a dominant negative manner to interfere with the function of endogenous NCS-1.Figure 1Preparation and characterization of an EF-hand mutant of NCS-1. a, schematic diagram of the EF-hand domains in NCS-1 showing the introduced mutation at the nucleotide (G → C) and protein (E120Q) level in the third EF-hand.b, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified recombinant NCS-1 and NCS-1(E120Q). c, analysis of the migration of NCS-1 and NCS-1(E120Q) on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To identify the small proportion of successfully transfected cells for recording, the cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) along with a plasmid encoding either NCS-1 or NCS-1(E120Q). This approach has previously been shown to lead to high levels (>95%) of co-expression in transfected adrenal chromaffin cells (25Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris ). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Expression of wild-type or mutated NCS-1 following transfection was verified by immunofluorescent staining. Using a concentration of anti-NCS-1 antiserum (1:400) too low to stain endogenous NCS-1, it was observed that GFP-negative cells showed no more than background staining. In contrast, GFP-positive cells were brightly stained showing that they overexpressed wild-type NCS-1 or NCS-1(E120Q) following transfection (Fig. 2). Essentially all GFP-positive cells were stained above background by anti-NCS-1 after transfection with plasmids encoding NCS-1 or NCS-1(E120Q). Ca2+ channel currents were monitored in GFP-expressing cells by whole cell voltage-clamp recording using standard protocols (23Twitchell W.A. Rane S.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 701-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with Ba2+ as the charge carrier. Cells transfected with GFP and pcDNA3.1 vector were used as controls. These control cells showed no obvious differences from non-transfected cells in their electrophysiological characteristics and possessed maximal Ca2+ currents of 235.4 ± 60pA (n = 10) on depolarization from a holding potential of −60 to 0 mV. Ca2+-channel currents monitored in control (GFP-expressing) cells and cells expressing NCS-1 or NCS-1(E120Q) were averaged for all cells from each condition. In each case, the currents were non-inactivating as shown for a depolarization step to 0 mV (Fig. 3 a). The averaged currents from NCS-1-overexpressing cells were little different from control cells. In contrast, a marked increase in Ca2+-channel currents was observed in cells expressing NCS-1(E120Q). Despite the difference in current magnitude, little difference was seen between conditions in the initial kinetics of current activation when the currents were normalized (Fig. 3 b). For more detailed comparison of the magnitude of Ca2+-channel currents, the values were corrected for cell capacitance to eliminate differences due to cell size. It was clear from these data that overexpression of wild-type NCS-1 had no significant effect on the size of Ca2+ currents in transfected chromaffin cells or their current-voltage relationship (Fig. 3 c). In contrast, cells transfected with NCS-1(E120Q) showed a large increase in Ca2+ currents (significant from analysis of variance,p < 0.0001). No changes were observed in the current/voltage relationships of the Ca2+ currents measured following expression of NCS-1(E120Q) (Fig. 3 c). Most studies have found that bovine chromaffin cells possess predominantly non-L-type Ca2+channels (27Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Gandia L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) but it has been controversially claimed that L-type Ca2+ channels can be recruited by a variety of manipulations (29Artalejo C.R. Ariano M.A. Perlman R.L. Fox A.P. Nature. 1990; 348: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30Artalejo C.R. Adams M.E. Fox A.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The effect of the L-type Ca2+channel blocker nifedipine on Ca2+ currents in NCS1-(E120Q)-expressing cells was examined. The Ca2+currents were found to be predominantly non-L-type as 3 μm nifedipine resulted in only between 0 and 18% inhibition of currents whereas these were abolished by addition of 250 μm cadmium (n = 4 cells). Under the conditions used here, non-L-type Ca2+ currents are under tonic autocrine inhibition (31Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is due to endogenous release of ATP and opioids from chromaffin cells in the dish. This inhibition can be removed by addition of P2y purinergic and opioid receptor antagonists (28Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Carabelli V. Carra I. Carbone E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1255-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In order to examine the relationship between the additional Ca2+ current in NCS1-(E120Q)-expressing cells and the recruitment of this pool of quiet Ca2+ channels, we examined the effect of addition of a combination of 100 μm suramin and 10 μmnaloxone to block purinergic and opioid receptors, respectively. The antagonists (Fig. 4 a) resulted in a rapid increase in Ca2+ currents in all 7 control cells with an increase of >20% in 6 cells. Under our conditions, addition of naloxone/suramin did not modify the channel activation kinetics. In contrast, addition of the antagonists to cells expressing NCS-1(E120Q) resulted in a much reduced increase in Ca2+ currents (Fig. 4 b) with an increase of <10% in 6 of 8 cells. The difference between the cells is shown in a comparison of the mean increases in Ca2+ current observed (Fig. 4 c). The effect of NCS-1(E120Q) cannot be due to an inhibition of secretion of ATP and opioids in the cultures as this occurs from all of the non-voltage-clamped cells in the dish of which we estimated that only 2% were transfected. The autocrine inhibition of Ca2+ channels in chromaffin cells can be overcome, but only partially, by prior strong depolarization (facilitation) suggesting the presence of both voltage-dependent and -independent mechanisms for channel inhibition (27Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Gandia L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two distinct receptor-dependent pathways for channel inhibition that differ in their reversibility by prior depolarization have been described for various neuronal cell types (33Diverse-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Formenti A. Martina M. Plebani A. Mancia M. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test which type of pathway was blocked by NCS-1(E120Q), Ca2+ currents were examined before and after a 50-ms prepulse to +90 mV. Facilitation was observed in control cells (Fig. 4 d) and a similar extent of facilitation was seen in NCS-1(E120Q)-expressing cells (Fig. 4, e and f). Voltage-dependent facilitation has been shown to increase the rate of channel activation as well as increasing steady-state current magnitude (33Diverse-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Formenti A. Martina M. Plebani A. Mancia M. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From examination of normalized traces it was clear that neither expression of NCS-1(E120Q) (Fig. 3 b) nor addition of naloxone and suramin (Fig. 5 a) modified the activation kinetics of the Ca2+ channel currents. In contrast, the prepulse protocol in either control or NCS-1(E120Q)-expressing cells produced a small but consistent increase in the rate of Ca2+ channel activation (Fig. 5, b andc). We also examined whether prepulse facilitation could still be elicited following addition of naloxone and suramin in control cells. In 4 cells tested an increase in current was seen following naloxone and suramin addition and in all 4 cells prepulse facilitation occurred to essentially the same extent as before antagonist addition (Fig. 6). These data are consistent with the existence of two distinct pathways for Ca2+ channel inhibition in chromaffin cells and with the NCS-1 mutant acting via the voltage-independent pathway. The results presented here suggest that NCS-1/frequenin may be a physiological regulator of Ca2+ channels in adrenal chromaffin cells based on the use of an EF-hand mutant, NCS-1(E120Q), that we suggest acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt the function of endogenous NCS-1. Overexpression of wild-type NCS-1 had no effect on Ca2+ channel currents in chromaffin cells, while expression of NCS-1(E120Q) resulted in an increase in non-L-type Ca2+ channel currents. The differences in the effect of these two proteins demonstrated the specificity of these changes and that the NCS-1(E120Q) effect was not just the consequence of protein overexpression. It was also not likely to be due to any deleterious effects of NCS-1(E120Q) expression on the cells. This would instead, be more likely to reduce Ca2+ channel currents as their maintenance is well known to be dependent on high intracellular ATP levels. We would argue that the effect of NCS-1(E120Q) on Ca2+ channel currents is a consequence of a dominant negative effect of this EF-hand mutant as seen for analogous calmodulin mutants (16Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.Y. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 19Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Yue D.T.

Cahalan M.D. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5746-5754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type calmodulin also has no effects on the activity of calmodulin-regulated channels. While we saw no effect of overexpression of NCS-1 in chromaffin cells our interpretation is supported by a description of an inhibition of high voltage-activated currents by overexpression of NCS-1/frequenin in neuroblastoma NG108–15 cells (38Burley J.R. Jeromin A. Robertson B. Roder J.C. Sihra T.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 611Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that NCS-1 normally functions in a pathway that inhibits high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. The major effect that we observed in this study was an increase in Ca2+ channel current magnitude in cells expressing NCS-1(E120Q) with no effect on the kinetics of activation, inactivation or current voltage relationship of the currents consistent with a recruitment of additional functional channels without modification of channel properties. The role of NCS-1 in inhibiting Ca2+channel function is opposite to that which would explain the stimulatory effects of NCS-1/frequenin overexpression on neurotransmitter release (7Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have identified, therefore, a novel, alternative cellular function for this protein that appears to be distinct from its effect on neurotransmitter release. It is likely that further use of the NCS-1(E120Q) mutant and similar constructs for other members of this Ca2+-binding protein family will allow discovery of other novel physiological roles of these proteins. Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells possess mainly non-L-type Ca2+ channels (27Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Gandia L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and it has been well established (31Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that a substantial pool of these Ca2+ channels can be inhibited, in an autocrine manner, by endogenously released ATP and opioids (23Twitchell W.A.

They can, however, be recruited into a functional pool under various conditions (28Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P.

The inhibited pool consists of a complex mixture of all non-L-type channels in chromaffin cells including P/Q- and N-type. This regulatory pathway operates by pertussis toxin-sensitive, G-protein-dependent mechanisms (31Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Doupnik C.A. Pun R.Y.K. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 420: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Cena V. Stutzin A.

Biol. 1989; 112: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) likely to involve, at least in part, direct interaction of G-protein βγ-subunits with Ca2+ channels (43Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 44Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). We revealed this inhibited current by addition of the purinergic and opioid antagonists suramin and naloxone as described previously (28Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 1255-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Following the increase in Ca2+current due to NCS-1(E120Q) expression, addition of the purinergic and opioid antagonists produced a substantially reduced increase in Ca2+ currents compared with control cells consistent with NCS-1(E120Q) and the antagonists acting on the same pool of Ca2+ channels. This suggests that the mechanism of the NCS-1(E120Q) effect was to remove the autocrine inhibition of Ca2+ channels in the cells. This implies that endogenous NCS-1 functions in this autocrine inhibitory pathway. In contrast to the results with the antagonists, the mutant did not inhibit facilitation due to a prepulse protocol. These findings are, however, consistent with previous work on chromaffin cells and on neuronal preparations. The autocrine inhibition of Ca2+ channel currents in chromaffin cells due to released secretory products is only reversed by up to 50% by pre-pulse depolarization suggesting the presence of two pathways, one voltage-dependent and one voltage-independent (28Currie K.P.M.

One pathway leads to inhibition of Ca2+ channel current has no effect on activation kinetics is not reversed by prior depolarization (33Diverse-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K.

The second pathway also results in a reduction in magnitude and also in slowing of activation kinetics, and is fully reversed by prepulse depolarization (i.e. is voltage-dependent). The two pathways involve different neurotransmitter receptors and G-proteins (33Diverse-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Dunlap K. Ikeda S.R. Semin. Neurosci. 1998; 9: 198-208Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Arnot M.I.

NCS-1(E120Q) expression did not affect activation kinetics (Fig. 3 b) nor did it inhibit the facilitation due to prepulse depolarization. These results suggest, therefore, that chromaffin cells also possess two inhibitory pathways and are entirely consistent with a role of NCS-1 in only the voltage-independent pathway. In addition, the effect of prepulse depolarization must be to reverse inhibition due, not to ATP or opioids, but to some other component released from the secretory granules. Previous work has suggested the presence of several inhibitory components present is chromaffin cell secretory granules (31Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results presented here provide insight into a novel function for NCS-1 in which it acts on a receptor-mediated feedback pathway controlling non-L-type Ca2+ channel function in chromaffin cells. Our data suggest the existence of both voltage-dependent and voltage-independent pathways for the regulation of Ca2+ channels in chromaffin cells and that NCS-1 specifically acts in the voltage-independent pathway. It is possible that NCS-1 may play a similar role in neurons where it could act on related presynaptic autoreceptor pathways to modulate Ca2+ channel function and thereby neurotransmitter release."

The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH2-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl β-hydroxylase, a member of the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate. Northern blot analysis indicates that junctate is expressed in a variety of human tissues including heart, pancreas, brain, lung, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the genetic loci of junctin and junctate map to the same cytogenetic band on human chromosome 8. Analysis of intron/exon boundaries of the genomic BAC clones demonstrate that junctin, junctate, and aspartyl β-hydroxylase result from alternative splicing of the same gene.The predicted lumenal portion of junctate is enriched in negatively charged residues and is able to bind calcium. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium 45Ca2+ binding in the presence of a physiological concentration of KCl demonstrate that junctate binds 21.0 mol of Ca2+/mol protein with a kDof 217 ± 20 μm (n = 5). Tagging recombinant junctate with green fluorescent protein and expressing the chimeric polypeptide in COS-7-transfected cells indicates that junctate is located in endoplasmic reticulum membranes and that its presence increases the peak amplitude and transient calcium released by activation of surface membrane receptors coupled to InsP3 receptor activation.Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl β-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate).

The anatomical site of excitation-contraction coupling is the triad, a unique intracellular synapsis that is formed by the association of the following membrane compartments: transverse tubules, which are an invagination of the sarcolemma, and the SR terminal cisternae (3Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The portion of terminal cisternae facing the transverse tubules is referred to as junctional face membrane SR (4Costello B. Chadwick C. Saito A. Chu A. Maurer A. Fleischer S. J.

In addition to the RYR, the junctional face membrane contains several proteins including the histidine-rich calcium binding protein, triadin, calsequestrin, and junctin (15Jones L.R. Zhang L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The most abundant polypeptide appears to be calsequestrin, the SR calcium storage protein (30MacLennan D.H. Wong P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1231-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), which might also be involved in the regulation of the RYR (31Kawasaki T. Kasai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Ikemoto N. Ronjat M. Meszaros L.G. Koshita M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6764-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Whether this effect is mediated by a direct interaction between the two proteins or via bridging calsequestrin binding proteins such as triadin or junctin is still controversial (17Caswell A.H. Brandt N.R. Brunschwig J.P. Purkerson S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7507-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The junctional face membrane is endowed with numerous other less abundant proteins having a molecular mass ranging from 20 kDa up to 120 kDa, which have yet to be identified and characterized at the molecular level (4Costello B. Chadwick C. Saito A. Chu A. Maurer A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because of their localization, the proteins that are present on the junctional face membrane are deemed to be involved in the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism, and a defect in the function of these proteins could potentially lead to alterations of the Ca2+ release process and/or intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Thus the characterization of all the molecular components of the junctional face membrane is important not only for our understanding of the basic mechanism of Ca2+storage and release in muscle and non-muscle cells but also in view of the enormous effort aimed at identifying novel genes which, upon mutation, may be linked to neuro/muscular diseases (34MacLennan D.H. Phillips M.S. Science. 1992; 256: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 35Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate the existence of junctate, a novel integral Ca2+ binding protein of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum membranes. The Ca2+ binding properties of junctate indicate that the protein might have an active role in the Ca2+ storage/release process in ER membranes in a variety of tissues including heart, brain, pancreas, lung, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. In addition, we report that an enzyme (aspartyl β-hydroxylase), a structural protein of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum membranes (junctin), and a calcium binding protein (junctate) belong to a family of single membrane-spanning proteins that result from alternative splicing events of the same gene located in human chromosome 8.

Terminal cisternae, longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum, transverse tubules, and sarcolemma were obtained from the white skeletal muscle of New Zealand rabbits as described (27Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was according to Lowryet al. (36Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Vesicles obtained from the various fractions of rabbit skeletal muscle were resuspended at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 1% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA containing 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine, and 1 mmpepstatin as anti-proteolytic agents (mixture of anti-proteolytic agents). The vesicles were solubilized for 30 min at room temperature under gentle agitation and centrifuged at 100,000 ×gmax for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with a heparin-agarose resin (1 ml of resin/mg of protein) previously equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A) for 60 min at room temperature under gentle agitation. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and proteins eluted with a step gradient of NaCl (300 mm, 500 mm, 750 mm,and 1 m) in Buffer A. Identification of the proteins contained in the 500 mm NaCl fraction was carried by Western blot analysis and microsequencing. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar); proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or by Stains All staining as described previously (38Treves S. De Mattei M. Landfredi M. Villa A. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared as described previously (38Treves S. De Mattei M. Landfredi M. Villa A. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The fraction eluting from the heparin-agarose column at 500 mm NaCl was concentrated by addition of 3 volumes of cold acetone. The insoluble protein fraction was collected as a pellet after centrifugation at 4000 rpm (3000 × gmax) in an ALC 5400 centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, and the proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis in a 10% slab gel. The proteins were revealed by imidazole/ZnSO4 reverse staining. To concentrate the protein, gel slices containing the 27-kDa protein bands (×8) were transferred to a rod gel in a Pasteur pipette. The glass of the Pasteur pipette tube was treated with 5% Cl2(CH3)2Si/CHCl3(dichloromethylsylane), dried, and the glass tubes were filled with a solution containing 5% acrylamide, 0.13% bisacrylamide, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of ammoniumpersulfate and TEMED. The gel slices were loaded on the rod gel in the presence of 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue. Electrophoresis was carried out at 150–200 mV until the bromphenol blue reached the narrow part of the Pasteur pipette. The protein band was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The slice of gel containing the protein was washed 3 times with 1 ml of MilliQ H2O and then incubated in 140 μl of CNBr/HCO2H (58.1 mg of CNBr/1.162 ml of HCO2H) plus 60 ml of H2O overnight at room temperature under vortex stirring. The next day the supernatant was transferred to another microvial and dried in a speed vac. The peptides derived from the 27-kDa protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The NH2-terminal sequence and the polypeptides derived from CNBr cleavage were subjected to amino acid sequencing several times (carried out by Prof. V. Hoppe, Physiologische Chemie II, Institute für Biowissenschaften der Univesität Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany). A human λtriplex oligo(dT)-primed skeletal muscle library was screened using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe obtained by RT-PCR of human skeletal muscle using forward and reverse primers obtained from the protein sequence of peptides 1 and 3; the sequences were 5′-AGA ATT CAC AGA GGA CAA AGA G-3′ and 5′-AGA ATT CTA ACG CGA TGA CCA T-3′, respectively. Amplification conditions were as follows: 45"" annealing at 45 °C, 30"" extension at 72 °C, and 30"" denaturation at 95 °C for a total of 35 cycles. The addition of an EcoRI restriction enzyme sequence was used to facilitate subcloning and sequencing of the amplified cDNA. After overnight hybridization of the filters at 42 °C with the labeled probe, the filters were washed at high stringency at 65 °C in 0.2× SSCP, 0.1% SDS; positive plaques were identified and purified, and the DNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Templates for sequencing were prepared in the Bluescript cloning vector. To obtain the full-length sequence we carried out nested exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease deletions according to a previously described procedure (39Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M.

Random/oligo(dT)-primed λgt10 human skeletal and cardiac muscle libraries using a cDNA 32P-labeled probe were obtained from λtriplex library clone. The primary sequence of the clones was obtained with an automated DNA sequencer using the dideoxy method. Human BAC genomic libraries were screened as described previously (40Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Sun Z. Shi Z.Y. Ma S. Vataru E. Yimlamai D. Weissenbach J.S. Shizuya H. Simon M.I. Gerety S.S. Nguyen H. Zemsteva I.S. Hui L. Silva J. Wu X. Birren B.W. Hudson T.J.

To identify BAC clones, colonies were lifted onto nylon membrane for hybridization probe analysis with radioactively labeled cDNA probes encompassing the 3′ end of both human junctin and junctate. FISH analysis was performed by Genomics Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Extra long PCR products were obtained using the GeneAmp XL PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) from 1 μg of BAC or genomic DNA with either 28 or 37 amplification cycles using the PCR primers reported in Table II. PCRs were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions; the products were purified with Microcon-100 (Millipore) and sequenced with the ABI PRISM Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit using the ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Figure 7Structure of the 5′ end of the human locus for aspartyl β-hydroxylase, junctin, and junctate. The top of the panel shows some of the PCRs performed using BAC 1, BAC 2, and genomic DNA as template. Three plasmid subclones of BAC 1 are also shown, covering the first and second exons of the locus. B, BglII;E, EcoRI; P, PstI.Arabic numbers over black boxes indicate exons. Intervening sequences are indicated in Roman numbers. Hatched bars represent part of the two BAC clones analyzed.

De Mattei M. Landfredi M. Villa A. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed twice with two distinct membranes. Blots were washed under high stringency (0.2× SSCP, 0.1%SDS at 65 °C for 60 min), and autoradiography was performed for 1 week (Northern blot) or 3 weeks (Southern blots) at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Northern blots were also probed with digoxigenin-labeled β-actin probe and washed under high stringency, and the tissue distribution of β-actin was revealed using an anti-digoxigenin peroxidase-conjugated (1:10,000) antibody followed by chemiluminescence. A GST fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal domain of junctate was constructed by fusing the 610-bp PCR-amplified cDNA (amino acid residues 98–298) in frame into the multiple cloning site of pGex5 × 3. The forward and reverse primers were, respectively, 5′-TCT CGA GGGGCA GTC TTT TTG AA-3′ and 5′-AGA ATT CTA CTT CAG AGC CAG CA-3′. Amplification conditions were as described for cDNA cloning except that the annealing temperature was 60 °C; the addition of theXhoI/EcoRI restriction enzyme sequence was used to facilitate cloning and sequencing of the amplified sequence. The GST fusion protein was purified from the bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described by the manufacturer. Calcium overlays on Western blots were carried out as described (41Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Calcium equilibrium binding was carried out by the use of a continuos flow microdialysis chamber as described previously (38Treves S. De Mattei M. Landfredi M. Villa A. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To monitor the intracellular distribution of junctate, we cloned it into the pEGFPC1 mammalian expression vector and monitored expression of the recombinant protein after transfection into COS-7 cells. Two NH2-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged constructs were made; one encompassed the whole coding sequence of junctate (nucleotides 1–979; EGFP-junctate), whereas the other encompassed the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domain between nucleotides 137 and 254 (EGFP-TM-junctate). PCR amplification conditions were as described for cDNA cloning except that the annealing temperature was 58 °C. TheEcoRI/BamHI restriction enzyme sequence was used to facilitate cloning and sequencing of the amplified sequence into the MCS of the pEGFPC1 plasmid. Forward and reverse primers for the EGFP-junctate construct were 5′-AGA ATT CAC AAA TGG CTG AAG-3′ and 5′-GAA GCT TTT AGG ATC CTG GTG-3′, respectively; forward and reverse primers for the EGFP-TM-junctate construct were 5′-GGA ATT CCA CCA TGA GGA AAG GCG GAC TCT CA-3′, and 5′-GGG ATC CCT TTG CTT TGG CTA GA, respectively. COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected using Lipofectin as described previously (42Censier K. Urwyler A. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 24 or 48 h after transfection cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and examined under fluorescent light (excitation, 480 nm; emission, 510 nm) using a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a PlanApo × 100/1.40 objective. The free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration of COS-7 cells was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1 using a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a × 60 Plan-Apo oil immersion objective attached to two photomultipliers (P100; Nikon Inc.). The cell to be measured was identified by its green fluorescence and then ratio fluorescence measurements (410/480 nm) were obtained as described previously (42Censier K. Urwyler A. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Excitation of indo-1 was achieved using a 100-watt mercury lamp attenuated by neutral density filters to avoid dramatic photobleaching. Stimulation of individual cells was obtained by an 8-way 100-μm diameter quartz micromanifold computer-controlled microperfusor (ALA Scientific). The total amount of calcium released and statistical analysis were performed using the Origin computer program (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Kidneys from 3.0–3.5-kg male New Zealand rabbit were homogenized (10% w/v) in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl plus a mixture of anti-proteolytic agents (see “Heparin-Agarose Chromatography”). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 ×gmax for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × gmax for 15 min. The 10,000 × gmax supernatant was then filtered through 10 layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 150,000 × gmax for 60 min. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.6 m KCl plus anti-proteolytic agents and was centrifuged at 150,000 × gmax for 60 min. The KCl-washed membranes were resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl at a final concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. The microsomal suspension was then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11. The membrane fraction pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 150,000 ×gmax for 60 min and washed with 0.6m KCl. Biochemical analyses of kidney microsomes were carried out with three different preparations with microsomes isolated from two different animals. Preparation of rabbit heart microsomes was essentially as described by Pessah et al. (43Pessah I.N. Durie E.L. Schiedt M.J. Zimanyi I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 503-514PubMed Google Scholar), except that the total microsomal fraction was washed with 0.6 m KCl before being layered onto the sucrose gradient to remove cytoskeletal proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1979088026,"After synthesis in the cytosol, Ras proteins must be targeted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane for biological activity. This targeting requires a series of C-terminal posttranslational modifications initiated by the addition of an isoprenoid lipid in a process termed prenylation. A search for factors involved in the intracellular trafficking of Ras has identified a specific and prenylation-dependent interaction between tubulin/microtubules and K-Ras. In this study, we examined the structural requirements for this interaction between K-Ras and microtubules. By using a series of chimeras in which regions of the C terminus of K-Ras were replaced with those of Ha-Ras and vice versa, we found that the polylysine region of K-Ras located immediately upstream of the prenylation site is required for binding of K-Ras to microtubules. Studies in intact cells confirmed the importance of the K-Ras polylysine region for microtubule binding, as deletion or replacement of this region resulted in loss of paclitaxel-induced mislocalization of a fluorescent K-Ras fusion protein. The additional modifications in the prenyl protein processing pathway also affected the interaction of K-Ras with microtubules. Removal of the three C-terminal amino acids of farnesylated K-Ras with the specific endoprotease Rce1p abolished its binding to microtubules. Interestingly, however, methylation of the C-terminal prenylcysteine restored binding. Consistent with these results, localization of the fluorescent K-Ras fusion protein remained paclitaxel-sensitive in cells lacking Rce1, whereas no paclitaxel effect was observed in cells lacking the methyltransferase. These studies show that the polylysine region of K-Ras is critical for its interaction with microtubules and provide the first evidence for a functional consequence of Ras C-terminal proteolysis and methylation.

Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The biological activity of the Ras proteins, like that of other G proteins, is controlled by a regulated GTP/GDP cycle. Upstream regulators, generally responding to tyrosine phosphorylation events, induce inactive, GDP-bound Ras to exchange bound GDP for GTP, resulting in activation, whereas GTPase-activating proteins enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and restore Ras to its inactive form (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 3Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Mutations at codons 12, 13, or 61 of Ras lead to inactivation of the GTPase activity and/or its sensitivity to GTPase-activating proteins, resulting in Ras proteins that are constitutively active and able to transform mammalian cells (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Such mutationally activated forms of Ras are found in a large number of human cancers (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 4Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar).Three Ras genes have been identified that encode closely related 21-kDa proteins: Ha-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B (4Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). K-Ras4B is the predominant form of K-Ras in nature, and the term K-Ras has frequently been used to denote K-Ras4B. All the Ras proteins share high degrees of homology in their N termini but diverge in a hypervariable region in their C termini. The differences in this hypervariable region are thought to be associated with different cellular functions for the proteins (5Jackson J.H. Li J.W. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12730-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol.

Specific Ras isoforms are mutated in different tumor types, with mutations in K-Ras appearing most frequently (3Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Recent studies with knockout mice have revealed that K-Ras (but not Ha-Ras or N-Ras) is essential in mouse embryonic development (9Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, the precise nature of the functional differences among Ras isoforms remains largely unclear.Each Ras protein terminates in a so-called CAAXsequence, where C is a cysteine; the A is usually an aliphatic amino acid, and X can be almost any amino acid. This C-terminal CAAX motif undergoes a trio of posttranslational modifications (10Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 11Schafer W.R. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 25: 209-238Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar) that are important for the activity of normal and oncogenic Ras proteins (12Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The initial processing step, farnesylation, is catalyzed by the enzyme protein farnesyltransferase (FTase)1and involves the addition of a 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid to the thiol group of the cysteine residue (13Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 14Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In the second step, the -AAX residues are removed by a specific endoprotease, Rce1 (15Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Finally, the carboxyl group of the newly exposed prenylcysteine at the C terminus is methylated by a specific methyltransferase, isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase (termed Ste14p in yeast and ICMT in mammals) (17Dai Q.

Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although these modifications, particularly prenylation, are essential for the association of Ras proteins with membranes, a second membrane localization signal in the hypervariable region is required for optimal membrane affinity. In Ha-Ras and N-Ras, this second signal is the palmitoylation of cysteine residues located near the C-terminal prenylcysteine (12Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the case of K-Ras, the second signal is a stretch of basic (lysine) residues located just upstream of the CAAX motif (19Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The additional membrane stability provided by palmitoylation and the polybasic domains appears to be important for Ras function, as their elimination has been shown to influence the cellular activity and transforming ability of the Ras proteins (5Jackson J.H. Li J.W. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12730-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Although the protein prenyltransferases are cytosolic, both the endoprotease and the methyltransferase are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (17Dai Q.

Thus, the current view is that Ras proteins are prenylated in the cytosol, translocated to the ER for further processing, and finally targeted to the plasma membrane (12Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). At this time, the mechanism(s) of intracellular Ras trafficking is incompletely understood.To identify factors involved in trafficking of Ras and other CAAX-type proteins, we began a search for proteins that could associate with prenylated CAAX peptides. One such protein was identified as the cytoskeletal protein tubulin, which binds certain peptides with specificity and high affinity. Its polymerized form (i.e. microtubules) also binds prenylated peptides (24Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13780-13783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A closer analysis revealed that microtubules bind to a small subset of farnesylated proteins, including K-Ras (25Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The binding of K-Ras to tubulin and microtubules was specific; Ha-Ras and a variety of other prenylated proteins did not bind. Additionally, prenylation of K-Ras was essential for this interaction. A direct link between K-Ras and microtubules was confirmed in living cells with experiments that showed that a K-Ras-green fluorescent protein fusion (GFP-K-Ras) did not reach the plasma membrane when the microtubule network was disrupted with paclitaxel, whereas GFP-Ha-Ras localization was unaffected (25Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These results suggested that an intact microtubule network is required for correct K-Ras targeting in cells and hinted that some K-Ras-dependent signaling processes might be dependent on the microtubule network (25Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine the structural requirements for the interaction between K-Ras and microtubules.RESULTSThe direct link between K-Ras and the microtubule network in cells identified in previous work suggested a role for this interaction for the localization and function of specific prenylated proteins (25Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In those studies, the cytoskeletal protein tubulin was found to specifically bind K-Ras in a fashion that required prenylation; farnesyl-Ha-Ras was not capable of binding to tubulin. To determine if N-Ras could associate with microtubules, we first analyzed the binding of N-Ras to microtubules in vitro. Recombinant N-Ras was produced in E. coli, enzymatically farnesylated with [3H]FPP, and loaded onto microtubule columns. The columns were washed at low ionic strength, and bound proteins were eluted with a buffer of high ionic strength. Fluorographic analysis of [3H]farnesyl-N-Ras and immunoblot analysis of Ras proteins in each fraction indicated that neither unfarnesylated nor farnesylated N-Ras could bind to microtubules (Fig. 1, A and B).In the previous study, we examined the effects of paclitaxel disruption of the microtubule network on the localization of GFP-Ras fusions, and we found that the microtubule disruption abolished targeting of K-Ras, but not Ha-Ras, to the plasma membrane (25Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed a similar approach to determine the effect of disrupting the microtubule network on the localization of a GFP-N-Ras fusion protein. Cells were treated with paclitaxel before transfection with plasmids encoding GFP-Ras. After 24 h, GFP-Ras localization was assessed with confocal microscopy. GFP-N-Ras remained on plasma membrane both before and after paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 2).Figure 2Comparison of the effect of paclitaxel on plasma membrane targeting of GFP-tagged K-Ras and N-Ras.Plasmids encoding GFP-N-Ras (left panels) or GFP-K-Ras (right panels) were introduced by transfection into NIH-3T3 cells that had been treated with vehicle (upper panels) or paclitaxel (lower panels). The localization of the fluorescent proteins was assessed by confocal microscopy 24 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although the isoforms of Ras proteins are highly homologous, they can be distinguished by a hypervariable region encompassing ∼25 residues of the C-terminal sequence (4Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). K-Ras is unique in that its hypervariable region contains a CAAX sequence of CVIM and a polylysine stretch just upstream from the CAAX motif. To explore whether these unique structural elements are required for K-Ras to interact with microtubules, we created a series of chimeric proteins in which regions of the C-terminal sequence of Ha-Ras were replaced with the corresponding regions of K-Ras and vice versa (see TableI). The exchanges included the following: (i) replacing the polylysine domain just upstream from the farnesylated cysteine in K-Ras with the corresponding region from Ha-Ras; (ii) replacing the polylysine stretch of K-Ras with a polyglutamine sequence, thereby abolishing the positive charged sequence; and (iii) replacing the C-terminal three residues of the CAAX motif of K-Ras with that found in Ha-Ras (i.e. -CVLS for -CVIM). The binding of these chimeric Ras proteins to microtubules was initially analyzed in the in vitro microtubule assay. The three Ras proteins lacked the polylysine domain upstream from the farnesylcysteine, (Ha-CVIM, K-(Q)nCVIM, and K-(H)CVLS), failed to bind to the immobilized microtubules (Fig. 3). However, the three chimeras that retained the polylysine sequence (i.e. Ha-(K)nCVLS, Ha-(K)nCVIM, and K-CVLS) showed significant microtubule binding. In control experiments, farnesylated K-Ras clearly bound to microtubules, whereas farnesylated Ha-Ras did not (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of total Ras protein confirmed these results (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the polylysine domain of K-Ras, in addition to the prenyl group, is important for the interaction of K-Ras with microtubules, whereas the specific CAAX sequence (i.e. CVIM versus CVLS) is not.Table IC-terminal sequences of wild-type and chimeric Ras proteins used in the studyProteinC-terminal sequenceHa-RasDESGPGCMSCKCVLSK-RasKKKKKKSKTKCVIMH-CVIMDESGPGCMSCKCVIMH-(K)nCVLSKKKKKKSK SCKCVLSH-(K)n CVIMKKKKKKSKTKCVIMK-CVLSKKKKKKSKTK CVLSK-(Q)nCVIMQQQQQQ SKTKCVIMK-(H)CVLSDESGPGCMSCKCVLSAll wild-type proteins and wild-type amino acid sequences are given in regular type.

Equal amounts of purified recombinant chimeric Ras proteins (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I) were subjected to in vitro farnesylation with purified recombinant FTase and [3H]FPP. The radiolabeled farnesylated Ras chimeras were applied to microtubule affinity columns, which were then washed with buffer and eluted as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Protein in the eluted fraction was collected, and [3H]farnesyl-Ras bound to the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy; see “Experimental Procedures” for details. Amounts of Ras in the eluted fraction were plotted as percentages of the total radiolabeled protein applied to the column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also examined the effect of the disruption of microtubule network on the localization of GFP-tagged Ras chimeras. Consistent with thein vitro data on microtubule binding, K-Ras proteins that were unable to bind microtubules in vitro (i.e.those lacking the polylysine domain) were resistant to paclitaxel-induced redistribution in cells (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, Ha-Ras chimeras containing the polylysine sequence acquired sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced mislocalization (Fig. 4 B). As previously demonstrated, switching of the polylysine to polyglutamine sequence alone resulted in mislocalization of most of the K-Ras to cytosolic locations even in untreated cells (19Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), but the paclitaxel insensitivity of the distribution of this protein (i.e.K-QnCVIM) still confirmed the in vitro result that it fails to interact with microtubules. The presence of the CVIM sequence (i.e. the K-Ras CAAX sequence) did not affect the cellular localization of Ras after paclitaxel treatment. These findings confirm that the polylysine stretch in K-Ras is critical for the interaction of K-Ras with microtubules and support the notion that an intact microtubule network is important for correct localization of K-Ras in cells.Figure 4Effect of paclitaxel treatment on plasma membrane targeting of GFP-tagged Ras chimeras. Plasmids encoding GFP-tagged Ras chimeric proteins in which the parental form was K-Ras (A) or Ha-Ras (B) (also see Table I) were introduced by transfection into NIH-3T3 cells that had been treated with vehicle (left panels) or paclitaxel (right panels). The localization of the expressed fluorescent proteins were then assessed by confocal microscopy 24 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we examined the influence of endoproteolysis and carboxyl methylation on the association between K-Ras and microtubules. [3H]Farnesyl-K-Ras was subjected to in vitroendoproteolysis or to both endoproteolysis and methylation and assessed for microtubule binding. Surprisingly, endoproteolytic removal of these residues abolished the binding of K-Ras to microtubules. However, methylation of the C-terminal farnesylcysteine restored binding activity essentially to the original level (Fig. 5 A). To exclude the possibility that the loss of binding in the endoprotease-treated K-Ras was due to artifactual changes unrelated to endoproteolysis, the proteolyzed species that flowed through the microtubule columns were methylated in vitro and reapplied to the microtubule column. Consistent with the in vitro binding studies, the K-Ras proteins in these fractions regained their ability to bind microtubules (Fig. 5 B). Further confirmation of the requirement for methylation came from studies in which unlabeled farnesyl-K-Ras was proteolyzed and subjected to methylation with [3H]AdoMet. Fluorographic analysis and filter binding assay of the fractions from microtubule columns confirmed that it was the methylated K-Ras associated with the microtubules (Fig. 5, C andD). In other experiments, neither endoproteolysis nor methylation conferred microtubule binding ability on Ha-Ras or N-Ras (data not shown).Figure 5Effect of C-terminal endoproteolysis and methylation on the interaction of K-Ras with microtubules. A, K-Ras was prenylated in vitro with FTase and [3H]FPP and then further processed by adding recombinant yeast Rce1p alone or by adding both Rce1 and recombinant Ste14p in the presence or absence of AdoMet. The processed forms of Ras were applied to microtubule affinity columns, which were washed and eluted as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Proteins in the eluted fractions were collected by filter binding, and [3H]farnesyl-K-Ras bound to the filters was quantitated by scintillation spectroscopy.B, [3H]farnesyl-K-Ras that had been treated with Rce1p and that had flowed through the microtubule column inA was collected, subjected to in vitromethylation with Ste14p and AdoMet, and then reapplied to the microtubule column, which was then washed and eluted as described in the legend to Fig. 1. [3H]Farnesyl-K-Ras was collected by filter binding and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.C, unlabeled farnesyl-K-Ras was subjected to methylation with recombinant ICMT and [3H]AdoMet, and the resulting reaction mixture was chromatographed on the microtubule column affinity column described in the legend to Fig. 1. Fractions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the [methyl-3H]farnesyl-K-Ras was visualized by fluorography. D, the radiolabeled K-Ras in each fraction obtained from the procedure depicted in C was quantitated by filter binding and liquid scintillation spectroscopy.

To confirm the in vitro result on the effect of endoproteolysis and methylation on the interaction between K-Ras with microtubules, we examined the effect of paclitaxel treatment on the localization of GFP-K-Ras in both Rce1- and Icmt-deficient cells. Consistent with the in vitro results, paclitaxel had a marked effect on localization of GFP-K-Ras in Rce1−/− cells but no effect on the localization of GFP-Ha-Ras (Fig. 6). In Icmt−/− cells, however, localization of GFP-K-Ras was paclitaxel-insensitive (Fig. 7). These results provide a striking demonstration that endoproteolysis and methylation of K-Ras can modulate the ability of the protein to associate with microtubules.Figure 6Effect of paclitaxel on the targeting of GFP-tagged Ras to the plasma membrane in Rce1 −/− cells.

Perhaps this was not too surprising given that the major feature of the hypervariable region of K-Ras is the polylysine region; however, it is noteworthy that the Ras-related proteins Rap1B and RhoA contain stretches of basic residues near their prenylated C termini but do not bind microtubules (25Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The most surprising findings of the current study were that removal of the -AAX sequence from the C terminus of K-Ras eliminated microtubule binding and that the binding could be restored by methylation of the C-terminal prenylcysteine. This is an exciting finding as it is the first demonstration of a functional consequence of Ras C-terminal proteolysis and methylation. Given that partially processed Ras that is farnesylated but retained the -AAXresidues does bind microtubules, these findings suggest that the presence of a carboxylate ion on the C-terminal prenylcysteine blocks Ras interaction with microtubules, and eliminating this negative charge with the formation of an α-carboxyl methyl ester restores microtubule binding.Methylation by ICMT is the only potentially reversible step among the three C-terminal posttranslational modifications and thus could be exploited for dynamic regulation of protein function (20Ashby M.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev.

The finding that carboxyl methylation is required for K-Ras to bind to microtubules suggests that the microtubule-K-Ras interaction and its related functions could be regulated. Hence, the current study not only demonstrates a novel function for"

Adenylate kinase (AK)-catalyzed transfer of adenine nucleotide beta- and gamma-phosphoryls has been implicated in intracellular energy communication and nucleotide metabolism. To demonstrate the significance of this reaction in cardiac energetics, phosphotransfer dynamics were determined by [(18)O]phosphoryl oxygen analysis using( 31)P NMR and mass spectrometry. In hearts with a null mutation of the AK1 gene, which encodes the major AK isoform, total AK activity and beta-phosphoryl transfer was reduced by 94% and 36%, respectively. This was associated with up-regulation of phosphoryl flux through remaining minor AK isoforms and the glycolytic phosphotransfer enzyme, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. In the absence of metabolic stress, deletion of AK1 did not translate into gross abnormalities in nucleotide levels, gamma-ATP turnover rate or creatine kinase-catalyzed phosphotransfer. However, under hypoxia AK1-deficient hearts, compared with the wild type, had a blunted AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer response, lowered intracellular ATP levels, increased P(i)/ATP ratio, and suppressed generation of adenosine. Thus, although lack of AK1 phosphotransfer can be compensated in the absence of metabolic challenge, under hypoxia AK1-knockout hearts display compromised energetics and impaired cardioprotective signaling. This study, therefore, provides first direct evidence that AK1 is essential in maintaining myocardial energetic homeostasis, in particular under metabolic stress."

Specific N-terminal phosphorylation is a biological feature unique to the human domain when compared with other homologous domains lacking immunopathogenic potential. We have recently cloned from a HeLa-derived cDNA library a novel serine/threonine kinase (Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP)) that phosphorylates the N-terminal region of the human domain (Raya, A. Revert, F, Navarro, S. and Saus J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 12642–12649).

Recombinantly expressed GPBPΔ26 exhibits lower activity than GPBP, due at least in part to a reduced ability of GPBPΔ26 to interact and to form very active high molecular weight aggregates. In human tissues, GPBP shows a more limited expression than GPBPΔ26 but displays a remarkable preference for the small vessels and for histological structures targeted by natural autoimmune responses including alveolar and glomerular basement membranes, the two main targets in Goodpasture disease.

Attention has been addressed to unique biological features of this domain compared with related domains from human or other species, since only the human α3(IV)NC1 has been implicated in spontaneous autoimmune pathogenesis. The human α3(IV)NC1 contains a unique N terminus (2Quinones S. Bernal D. Garcı́a-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol.

Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and this report). This fact, along with the finding that GPBP is preferably expressed in tissues and cells that are targets in common spontaneous autoimmune diseases prompted the idea that GPBP might be important in human autoimmune pathogenesis (4Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Here we report the existence of two isoforms of GPBP that are generated by alternative splicing of a 78-bp exon that encodes a 26-residue serine-rich motif. The presence of the 26-residue motif in the polypeptide chain results in a more active molecular species that shows preferential expression in tissue structures targeted by autoimmune responses, and the expression of which is up-regulated during autoimmune pathogenesis.DISCUSSIONAlternative pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental mechanism for differential gene expression that has been reported to regulate the tissue distribution, the intracellular localization, and the activity of different protein kinases (9Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Naito Y. Watanabe Y. Yokokura H. Sugita R. Nishio M. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Closely resembling GPBP, B-Raf exits as different spliced variants in which the presence of specific exons results in more interactive, efficient, and oncogenic kinases (13Papin C. Denouel-Galy A. Laugier D. Calothy G. Eychène A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24939-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Although it is evident that rGPBPΔ26 still bears the uncharacterized catalytic domain of this novel kinase, both binding and phosphorylating activities are greatly reduced when compared with rGPBP. Gel filtration and two-hybrid experiments provide some insights into the mechanisms that underlie such a reduced phosphate transfer activity. About 1–2% of rGPBP is organized in very high molecular weight aggregates that display about one-third of the phosphorylating activity of rGPBP, indicating that molecular aggregation renders a more efficient quaternary structure. Consistently rGPBPΔ26, with virtually no peak I material, displays a reduced kinase activity. However, aggregation does not seem to be the only mechanism by which the 26-residue motif increases the specific activity since the rGPBPΔ26 material present in peak II also shows a reduced phosphorylating activity when compared with homologous fractions of rGPBP. Far Western and two-hybrid studies suggest that rGPBP-derived aggregates also display higher specific activities because the insertion of the 26-residue motif renders a more interactive and strengthened quaternary structure. Conformational changes induced by the presence of an exon-encoded motif that alters the activation status of the kinase have been proposed for the linker domain of the Src protein (14Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) and exons 8b and 10 of B-Raf (13Papin C. Denouel-Galy A. Laugier D. Calothy G. Eychène A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24939-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the 26-residue motif may provide the structural requirements for specific phosphorylation (Ser or Tyr) necessary for full activation of the kinase. In any event, the similar activity displayed by each individual isoform in the in-blot renaturation studies indicates the existence of a common catalytic domain and suggests that GPBPΔ26 and GPBP represent different strategies to regulate its activity.The primary structure of the α3(IV)NC1 lends itself to a complex folding process that yields multiple conformers (conformational isomers). Non-assembled conformers are metastable structures specifically activated by phosphorylation for supramolecular aggregation and likely quaternary structure formation. 3A. Raya, F. Revert, C. Tárrega, T. Hellmark, A. Boutaud, J. Cervera, J. R. Penadés, J. Wieslander, B. G. Hudson, S. Quiñones, Y. Ninomiya, and J. Saus, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, phosphorylation is a signal that the cell uses to derive the folding of the α3(IV)NC1 domain toward non-minimum energy ends.3Finally, the α3(IV)NC1 domain of GP patients shows conformational alterations that are specifically recognized by the pathogenic autoantibodies, suggesting that altered conformers elicited the autoimmune response.3In this scenario, three features of the human system place the conformational process of the α3(IV)NC1 domain in a vulnerable condition that, in turn, predispose humans for GP disease. 1) The N terminus of the human α3(IV)NC1 contains a phosphorylatable motif shared by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and GPBP (2Quinones S.

Exon skipping generates alternative products with divergent C-terminal ends that up-regulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation of the primary α3(IV)NC1 product. 4J. R. Penadés, A. Raya, and J. Saus, unpublished results.3) GPBP is expressed and associated with the two major targets of the GP autoantibodies, glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. So far, all the GP kidneys studied expressed higher levels of the alternative product (5Bernal D. Quinones S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12090-12094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an augmented expression of GPBP has been found in a GP patient. Both conditions are expected to increase the phosphorylation of the α3(IV)NC1 domain and therefore to influence the corresponding conformational process.Keratinocytes, during maturation from basal to corneum strata, undergo an apoptosis-dependent differentiation process (16Polakowska R.R.

In the epidermis, GPBP is associated with cell surface blebs of keratinocytes suggesting that GPBP expression and apoptosis are related processes. Keratinocytes from SLE patients show a remarkably increased sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis (8Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp.

Consistently, we found GPBP expressed in apoptotic bodies expanding from basal to peripheral strata in the epidermis affected by different autoimmune processes including CLE, pemphigus, pemphigoid, and lichen planus. Autoantigens and modified versions thereof are clustered at the cell surface blebs of apoptotic keratinocytes (8Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp.

It has been suggested that the release of modified autoantigens from apoptotic bodies could be the immunizing event that mediates systemic autoimmune responses leading to SLE and scleroderma (18Casciola-Rosen L.

Finally, phosphorylation has been reported to be a major modification that autoantigens undergo in apoptotic keratinocytes (19Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis & Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Although not being limited to an exact mechanism, we propose, in light of all of the above data, that GPBP/GPBPΔ26 likely represent two different strategies to regulate a kinase that is involved in the phosphorylation-dependent folding process of specific self-components. In certain tissues, the expression of the more active GPBP could serve to generate misfolded substrates as a part of an apoptotic-dependent strategy for desired cell removal,e.g. corneum stratum of the epidermis. Ectopic and/or augmented expression of GPBP could release an excess of altered antigens and engage the immune system in a more general autoimmune response as occurs in SLE or scleroderma. In other locations,e.g. the human glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, the presence of the active GPBP isoform may be required for efficient phosphorylation-mediated collagen IV assembly. An augmented expression of the alternative α3(IV)NC1 products alone or with increased levels of GPBP could result in the generation of α3(IV)NC1 conformers for which the immune system has not established a tolerance. Upon assembly, the altered conformers could engage the immune system in a tissue-restricted autoimmune response as in GP disease.The substrate condition of the α3(IV)NC1 domain for GPBP (4Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) along with the presence of GPBP associated with the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes seem to predispose humans to undergo GP disease. Similarly, autoantigens and GPBP co-localize in the apoptotic bleb, and recombinant proteins representing autoantigens in SLE (P1 ribosomal phosphoprotein and Sm-D1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) or in dermatomyositis (histidyl-tRNA synthetase) are in vitrosubstrates of GPBP (not shown). It is therefore likely that GPBP generates modified versions of the autoantigens which when released from the apoptotic bodies mediate the autoimmune responses in SLE or in dermatomyositis.Although further studies are needed to define precisely the biological role of GPBP/GPBPΔ26, the low expression of GPBP in cancer cell lines (Fig. 2) and its high expression in the apoptotic bodies suggest that GPBP is involved in signaling pathways induced during programmed cell death. As discussed, GPBP expression could be up-regulated during autoimmune pathogenesis and mediate the immune response. Conversely, down-regulation of GPBP during cell transformation would prevent an autoimmune attack on the transformed cells during tumor growth. Goodpasture (GP)1disease is an exclusive human disorder characterized by altered renal and pulmonary functions caused by deposits of autoantibodies along the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. The pathogenic antibodies arise against the non-collagenous C-terminal (NC1) region of the α3 chain of collagen IV (α3(IV)NC1), also called the GP antigen (for review see Ref. 1Saus J. Delves P.J. Roitt I.M. Goodpasture's Syndrome: Encyclopedia of Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1998: 1005-1011Google Scholar). Attention has been addressed to unique biological features of this domain compared with related domains from human or other species, since only the human α3(IV)NC1 has been implicated in spontaneous autoimmune pathogenesis. The human α3(IV)NC1 contains a unique N terminus (2Quinones S. Bernal D. Garcı́a-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19780-19784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Revert F. Penadés J.R. Plana M. Bernal D. Johansson C. Itarte E. Cervera J. Wieslander J. Quinones S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13254-13261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP), a novel non-conventional protein kinase, binds and phosphorylates in vitro (Ref. 4Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and this report). This fact, along with the finding that GPBP is preferably expressed in tissues and cells that are targets in common spontaneous autoimmune diseases prompted the idea that GPBP might be important in human autoimmune pathogenesis (4Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here we report the existence of two isoforms of GPBP that are generated by alternative splicing of a 78-bp exon that encodes a 26-residue serine-rich motif. The presence of the 26-residue motif in the polypeptide chain results in a more active molecular species that shows preferential expression in tissue structures targeted by autoimmune responses, and the expression of which is up-regulated during autoimmune pathogenesis. DISCUSSIONAlternative pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental mechanism for differential gene expression that has been reported to regulate the tissue distribution, the intracellular localization, and the activity of different protein kinases (9Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Naito Y. Watanabe Y. Yokokura H. Sugita R. Nishio M. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Closely resembling GPBP, B-Raf exits as different spliced variants in which the presence of specific exons results in more interactive, efficient, and oncogenic kinases (13Papin C. Denouel-Galy A. Laugier D. Calothy G. Eychène A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24939-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Although it is evident that rGPBPΔ26 still bears the uncharacterized catalytic domain of this novel kinase, both binding and phosphorylating activities are greatly reduced when compared with rGPBP. Gel filtration and two-hybrid experiments provide some insights into the mechanisms that underlie such a reduced phosphate transfer activity. About 1–2% of rGPBP is organized in very high molecular weight aggregates that display about one-third of the phosphorylating activity of rGPBP, indicating that molecular aggregation renders a more efficient quaternary structure. Consistently rGPBPΔ26, with virtually no peak I material, displays a reduced kinase activity. However, aggregation does not seem to be the only mechanism by which the 26-residue motif increases the specific activity since the rGPBPΔ26 material present in peak II also shows a reduced phosphorylating activity when compared with homologous fractions of rGPBP. Far Western and two-hybrid studies suggest that rGPBP-derived aggregates also display higher specific activities because the insertion of the 26-residue motif renders a more interactive and strengthened quaternary structure. Conformational changes induced by the presence of an exon-encoded motif that alters the activation status of the kinase have been proposed for the linker domain of the Src protein (14Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) and exons 8b and 10 of B-Raf (13Papin C. Denouel-Galy A. Laugier D. Calothy G. Eychène A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24939-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the 26-residue motif may provide the structural requirements for specific phosphorylation (Ser or Tyr) necessary for full activation of the kinase. In any event, the similar activity displayed by each individual isoform in the in-blot renaturation studies indicates the existence of a common catalytic domain and suggests that GPBPΔ26 and GPBP represent different strategies to regulate its activity.The primary structure of the α3(IV)NC1 lends itself to a complex folding process that yields multiple conformers (conformational isomers). Non-assembled conformers are metastable structures specifically activated by phosphorylation for supramolecular aggregation and likely quaternary structure formation. 3A. Raya, F. Revert, C. Tárrega, T. Hellmark, A. Boutaud, J. Cervera, J. R. Penadés, J. Wieslander, B. G. Hudson, S. Quiñones, Y. Ninomiya, and J. Saus, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, phosphorylation is a signal that the cell uses to derive the folding of the α3(IV)NC1 domain toward non-minimum energy ends.3Finally, the α3(IV)NC1 domain of GP patients shows conformational alterations that are specifically recognized by the pathogenic autoantibodies, suggesting that altered conformers elicited the autoimmune response.3In this scenario, three features of the human system place the conformational process of the α3(IV)NC1 domain in a vulnerable condition that, in turn, predispose humans for GP disease. 1) The N terminus of the human α3(IV)NC1 contains a phosphorylatable motif shared by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and GPBP (2Quinones S.

Exon skipping generates alternative products with divergent C-terminal ends that up-regulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation of the primary α3(IV)NC1 product. 4J. R. Penadés, A. Raya, and J. Saus, unpublished results.3) GPBP is expressed and associated with the two major targets of the GP autoantibodies, glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. So far, all the GP kidneys studied expressed higher levels of the alternative product (5Bernal D. Quinones S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12090-12094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an augmented expression of GPBP has been found in a GP patient. Both conditions are expected to increase the phosphorylation of the α3(IV)NC1 domain and therefore to influence the corresponding conformational process.Keratinocytes, during maturation from basal to corneum strata, undergo an apoptosis-dependent differentiation process (16Polakowska R.R.

Cell surface bleb formation is a well-established step between nuclear condensation and cytoplasmic contraction in the apoptotic morphological cascade of many cell systems including keratinocytes (8Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). In the epidermis, GPBP is associated with cell surface blebs of keratinocytes suggesting that GPBP expression and apoptosis are related processes. Keratinocytes from SLE patients show a remarkably increased sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis (8Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp.

Santiago B. Galindo M. Carreira P.E. Ballestin C. Gomez-Reino J.J. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found GPBP expressed in apoptotic bodies expanding from basal to peripheral strata in the epidermis affected by different autoimmune processes including CLE, pemphigus, pemphigoid, and lichen planus. Autoantigens and modified versions thereof are clustered at the cell surface blebs of apoptotic keratinocytes (8Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp.

It has been suggested that the release of modified autoantigens from apoptotic bodies could be the immunizing event that mediates systemic autoimmune responses leading to SLE and scleroderma (18Casciola-Rosen L.

In certain tissues, the expression of the more active GPBP could serve to generate misfolded substrates as a part of an apoptotic-dependent strategy for desired cell removal,e.g. corneum stratum of the epidermis. Ectopic and/or augmented expression of GPBP could release an excess of altered antigens and engage the immune system in a more general autoimmune response as occurs in SLE or scleroderma. In other locations,e.g. the human glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, the presence of the active GPBP isoform may be required for efficient phosphorylation-mediated collagen IV assembly.

In other locations,e.g. the human glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, the presence of the active GPBP isoform may be required for efficient phosphorylation-mediated collagen IV assembly. An augmented expression of the alternative α3(IV)NC1 products alone or with increased levels of GPBP could result in the generation of α3(IV)NC1 conformers for which the immune system has not established a tolerance. Upon assembly, the altered conformers could engage the immune system in a tissue-restricted autoimmune response as in GP disease. The substrate condition of the α3(IV)NC1 domain for GPBP (4Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) along with the presence of GPBP associated with the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes seem to predispose humans to undergo GP disease. Similarly, autoantigens and GPBP co-localize in the apoptotic bleb, and recombinant proteins representing autoantigens in SLE (P1 ribosomal phosphoprotein and Sm-D1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) or in dermatomyositis (histidyl-tRNA synthetase) are in vitrosubstrates of GPBP (not shown). It is therefore likely that GPBP generates modified versions of the autoantigens which when released from the apoptotic bodies mediate the autoimmune responses in SLE or in dermatomyositis. Although further studies are needed to define precisely the biological role of GPBP/GPBPΔ26, the low expression of GPBP in cancer cell lines (Fig. 2) and its high expression in the apoptotic bodies suggest that GPBP is involved in signaling pathways induced during programmed cell death. As discussed, GPBP expression could be up-regulated during autoimmune pathogenesis and mediate the immune response. Conversely, down-regulation of GPBP during cell transformation would prevent an autoimmune attack on the transformed cells during tumor growth.

In the present study we demonstrate that calponin binds directly to the regulatory domain of PKC both in overlay assays and, under native conditions, by sedimentation with lipid vesicles. Calponin was found to bind to the C2 region of both PKCε and PKCα with possible involvement of C1B. The C2 region of PKCε binds to the calponin repeats with a requirement for the region between amino acids 160 and 182. We have also found that calponin can directly activate PKC autophosphorylation. By using anti-phosphoantibodies to residue Ser-660 of PKCβII, we found that calponin, in a lipid-independent manner, increased auto-phosphorylation of PKCα, -ε, and -βII severalfold compared with control conditions. Similarly, calponin was found to increase the amount of 32P-labeled phosphate incorporated into PKC from [γ-32P]ATP. We also observed that calponin addition strongly increased the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into an exogenous PKC peptide substrate, suggesting an activation of enzyme activity. Thus, these results raise the possibility that calponin may function in smooth muscle to regulate PKC activity by facilitating the phosphorylation of PKC.

Scand. 1998; 164: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Calponin, unlike other actin-binding proteins that inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity (such as caldesmon and tropomyosin), has been reported to undergo an agonist-induced translocation (3Parker C.A. Takahashi K. Tao T. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1262-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Parker C.A. Takahashi K. Tang J.X. Tao T. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1998; 508: 187-198Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Calponin is also a well established in vitro substrate for protein kinase C (PKC)1 as well as a possiblein vivo substrate (2Winder S.J. Allen B.G. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, this laboratory reported that calponin co-immunoprecipitates with ERK1 and with PKCε in ferret aorta homogenates, co-localizes in cells with ERK1 and PKCε, and binds activated PKCε in a gel overlay assay (5Menice C.B. Hulvershorn J. Adam L.P. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25157-25161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Calponin was speculated to function as an adaptor protein connecting the PKC cascade to the ERK cascade. Three isoforms of calponin have been described in mammalian tissues. The isoform found in smooth muscle, h1 or basic calponin, is unusual in that it has an isoelectric point of 9.6. All isoforms of calponin contain an N-terminal conserved region called the calponin homology domain (CH domain). This region has been implicated in actin binding of many cytoskeletal proteins, but in the case of calponin, it has only been shown to bind acidic phospholipid (6Bogatcheva N.V. Gusev N.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Fujii T. Yamana K. Ogoma Y. Kondo Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and ERK (8Leinweber B.D. Leavis P.C. Grabarek Z. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The central region of calponin, which has homology to troponin I, is the primary actin binding region of basic calponin. The C-terminal half of calponin contains three repeats that have been shown to be composed of a second actin-binding site (9Mino T. Yuasa U. Nakamura F. Naka M. Tanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Gimona M. Mital R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar) but otherwise have no known function. Protein kinase C is a family of kinases regulated by calcium (conventional isoforms α, β, and γ), by diacylglycerol (conventional isoforms and novel isoforms δ, ε, η, and θ), and by less characterized means (atypical isoforms (i/λ and ζ) and PKD/μ) (11Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Other than atypical isoforms, the predominant isoform in ferret portal vein smooth muscle cells is PKCα, whereas the dominate isoform in ferret aorta smooth muscle cells is PKCε (12Lee Y.-H. Kim I. Laporte R. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 517: 709-720Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ferret aorta, but not portal vein, can undergo contraction in response to PKC agonists in the absence of calcium. This contraction does not result from an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation (5Menice C.B. Hulvershorn J. Adam L.P. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25157-25161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). While the exact targets of PKC that allow contraction in absence of increased intracellular calcium and myosin light chain phosphorylation are not known, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways are one possibility (13Dessy C. Kim I. Sougnez C.L. Laporte R. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1081-C1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All PKC isoforms contain catalytic and regulatory domains, as reviewed in Newton (11Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain contains a pseudosubstrate region that binds the catalytic cleft inhibiting phosphotransferase activity of PKC. The regulatory domain also contains a C2 region that binds acidic phospholipid as well as calcium in the case of the conventional isoforms. The C1 region binds diacylglycerol in conventional and novel isoforms. It is binding of lipid to the C1 and C2 domains that releases the pseudosubstrate region from the catalytic cleft. Arginine-rich basic proteins, however, have been shown to activate PKC in the absence of lipid agonists (14Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of lipid, basic peptides such as polylysine and polyarginine can inhibit PKC phosphorylation of substrate, the greatest inhibition being toward basic substrates with neutral substrates less affected (15Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to identify the domains of PKC and calponin that interact and, by doing so, clarify whether it is a kinase-substrate interaction or whether calponin might regulate the activation/targeting of PKC. It is shown here that calponin can interact with the regulatory domains of PKC and directly activate kinase activity in a lipid-independent manner, as assayed by32P incorporation into peptide substrates and by autophosphorylation experiments using a phospho-specific PKC antibody. These results, in combination with past studies, suggest that calponin has the potential to be an in vivo protein modulator of PKC activity. Human recombinant PKCα and PKCε, produced from baculovirus in insect cells, were purchased from Panvera (Madison, WI). Rat brain PKCα was obtained from Sigma; Ser-PKC19-31 was obtained from Life Technologies Inc., and histone F2b was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The phospho-PKCIIβ (Ser-660) antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against the regulatory domains of PKCα and PKCε were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. A monoclonal antibody raised against gizzard calponin (catalog number 6047) was obtained from Sigma and used in all cases except where calponin fragments were studied. In the latter case, a polyclonal antibody raised to gizzard calponin was provided by Dr. Katsuhide Mabuchi. This antibody recognized all calponin fragments. Expression vectors encoding the regulatory domain of human PKCα (16Parissenti A.M. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Snihura A.L. Schimmer B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 66: 609-617Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and murine PKCε (17Parissenti A.M. Kirwan A.F. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Schimmer B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8940-8945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were supplied by Drs. Bernard P. Schimmer and Amadeo Parissenti. Phosphatidylserine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Calponin was isolated from turkey gizzard using the procedure of Abe et al. (1990) (18Abe M. Takahashi K. Hiwada K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). RegPKCε and regPKCα were expressed in the DH5α or BL21 strains ofEscherichia coli following the procedure of Parissenti (17Parissenti A.M. Kirwan A.F. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Schimmer B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8940-8945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This expression system consistently yielded full-length GSTregPKCα. GSTregPKCε is highly susceptible to limited proteolysis such that most of our preparations yielded a 45-kDa fragment (GSTregPKCε(V1/C2)) rather than the full-length 68-kDa product. Fragments of regPKCα expressed as GST fusion proteins were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of specific coding sequences using primers containing BamHI and EcoRI cleavage sites to facilitate cloning into the GST expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fragments expressed as GST fusion proteins corresponded to amino acids 36–99, 100–177, 178–268, and 36–177 of regPKCα and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The proteins are referred to as GSTregPKCα(C1A), GSTregPKCα(C1B/V2), GSTregPKCα(C2), GSTregPKCα(C1/V2), respectively, where C1A and C1B refer to the first and second phorbol-binding domains. Calponin was digested with α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) (19el-Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the Staphylococcus aureusV8 protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). V8 fragments were purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column developed with a 0–100% water acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. In some cases, HPLC-purified peptides were identified by N-terminal sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems model 477A Pulsed Liquid Protein Sequencer and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry on a Perspective Biosystems Voyager Elite Biospectrometry Workstation. PKC autophosphorylation was carried out in the following solution A: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3, 1 mm ATP, and 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. PKCβ, PKCα, or PKCε (at a 20 nmconcentration) was incubated in solution A with either 1 mg/ml PS and 10−5m DPBA, 25 μmBSA, 25 μm protamine, or 25 μm calponin for 15 s at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer followed by boiling. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and processed with antibody raised against phosphoserine 660. After visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence, blots were stripped and processed with a non-phosphospecific antibody. These values were used to correct for minor variations in loading. The effect of calponin and other agents on PKC autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of exogenous PKC substrates were also monitored by analysis of kinase reaction products by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography using [γ-32P]ATP as the phosphate donor. Assays were conducted in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 and varying concentrations of calponin, histone, BSA, and the PKC substrate peptide Ser-PKC19-31. Each assay contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as buffer, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by addition of boiling 6× gel loading buffer (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.6 m dithiothreitol, 12% SDS, 0.6% bromphenol blue, 60% glycerol) and loaded onto a large 12% acrylamide gel for resolution by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed in ethanol/acetic acid/water (5:1:5) for 3 h with rocking and washed 6 times for 3 h with rocking in 10% acetic acid to remove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP. The gel was then placed in a heat-sealable bag, sealed, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for varying times at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. As discussed “Materials and Methods,” expression of the 68-kDa GSTregPKCε construct also yielded an approximately 45-kDa by-product due to partial proteolysis. In overlay assays calponin bound to the 68-kDa full-length GSTregPKCε (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) and to an approximately 45-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The 45-kDa fragment was determined by N-terminal sequencing (MSPIL) combined with mass spectroscopy (44.1 kDa) to contain full-length GST plus amino acids 1 to 154–157 of PKCε. This corresponds to the V1 and C2 regions of the molecule but does not include the pseudosubstrate site or the C1 region. We have termed the 45-kDa fragment GSTregPKCε(V1/C2). Binding was minimal to GST alone (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Full-length (56 kDa) GSTregPKCα was also expressed. GSTregPKCα is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1 B combined with a negative control, GST. The right panel suggests that calponin interacts far less with the 56-kDa GSTregPKCα band compared with that for GSTregPKCε(V1/C2). Co-sedimentation of GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) and calponin with lipid vesicles was used to test whether an association between the two proteins could be seen under native conditions. GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) had a moderate affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS) vesicles and hence came down in the pellet (Fig. 2, supernatant (s)versus pellet (p) lane 1), whereas calponin had only a slight affinity for the vesicles (Fig. 2,s versus p, lane 2); however, the presence of regPKCε(V1/C2) greatly increased the binding of calponin to PS vesicles (Fig. 2, s versus p, lane 3). More binding of GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) to the PS vesicles was also seen in the presence of calponin suggesting that the binding of calponin to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) may have caused a change in the availability of PS-binding sites. In order to define the domains of calponin important for PKC binding, chymotryptic and V8 digests of calponin were performed. Whole calponin, limited (1:1000, 5 or 15 min) and extended (1:100, 1 h) chymotrypsin digest of calponin, and V8 (1:50, 4 h) digests were used in overlay assays to detect GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) binding. The identity of all fragments used was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry (Table I and Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 A shows the proteins used in the overlay phase as follows: lane 1,whole calponin; lane 2, a limited chymotryptic digest calponin-(7–152) that migrates at 20 kDa and calponin-(183–261)/calponin-(183–290) that migrates between 13 kDa and 14 kDa; lane 3, an exhaustive chymotryptic digest containing mostly calponin-(7–91) that migrates at 13 kDa; andlane 4, HPLC purified calponin-(160–291) from a V8 digest that migrates at about 14 kDa. The concentration of whole calponin or calponin fragments used in the overlay solutions (Fig. 3 C) was approximately 1.5 μm. Fig. 3 C shows overlay assays using the 45-kDa GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) fragment on the membrane. Panel 1 demonstrates binding of whole calponin to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2). In contrast, although the limited chymotrypsin digest contained all fragments of the parent molecule and was added at the same concentration as whole calponin, no binding to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) could be detected at these film exposures (Fig. 3 C, panel 2). Similarly, essentially no binding to calponin-(7–91) containing most of the CH domain could be detected (Fig. 3 C, panel 3). Binding was also not detected between GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) and the V8 fragment calponin-(1–154) (Table I). On the other hand, when 1.5 μm calponin-(160–291) from the V8 digest was used in the overlay assay (Fig. 3 C, panel 4), binding to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) was almost as great as that observed for whole calponin (Fig. 3 C, panel 1). Since the calponin-(183–290) chymotryptic fragment did not bind GSTregPKCε(V1/C2), these results indicate that the region from 160 to 182 is required for binding the regulatory domain of PKCε. It is also interesting to note that no binding was observed to the CH domain, a region that has previously been shown to bind ERK (Fig. 3 C, panel 3).Table IProteolytic fragments of calponinProteinProteaseDilutionN-terminal sequenceMr by mass spectrometryApparentMr SDS-PAGEFraction positive binding to GSTregPKCɛ(V1/C2)NamekDaCalponinChymotrypsin1:1000 (Fig. 3A)Blocked30317 of 7Calponin-(1–272)NRGPA16.4200 of 3Calponin-(7–152)GTRRH8.413–141 of 5Calponin-(183–261)GTRRH11.513–141 of 5Calponin-(183–290)CalponinChymotrypsin1:1000 (Fig. 3D)WIEGA/20.4203 of 3Calponin-(37–221)WHKLE20.3Calponin-(82–266)1:100NRGPA9.4131 of 5Calponin-(7–91)V81:5017.5170 of 3Calponin-(1–154)GRNII14.1148 of 9Calponin-(160–291) Open table in a new tab When the assay was reversed (Fig. 3 D), i.e. the calponin fragments were on the membrane and GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) was in the overlay buffer and an anti-PKCε regulatory domain antibody was used for detection, a similar localization of the PKC-binding domain could be made. GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) was found to consistently bind to the V8 fragment of calponin-(160–291) (Fig. 3 D, lane 1) and to a 31-kDa fragment of calponin (amino acids 1–272) only obtained upon very limited digestion of the molecule (Fig. 3 D, lane 2). This 31-kDa fragment was N-terminally blocked, and the assumption was made that it started with the first residue of calponin. By using this assumption, it was calculated that the fragment extended to residue 272 at most. Removal of 20 amino acids would result in an approximately 2-kDa decrease in molecular mass; thus we referred to it here as calponin-(1–272) because this is the maximum possible length for an N-terminally blocked chymotryptic fragment of calponin that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa. Lane 2 of Fig. 3 D also shows an approximately 20-kDa band that shows some binding to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) in the corresponding overlay. The digest used for Fig. 3 D, however, differed from that used in Fig. 3 A. When the 20-kDa band from lane 2 of Fig. 3 D was excised and sequenced, the results gave two amino acid residues in approximately equal amounts at each Edman cycle, indicating that the band was heterogeneous. Comparison of the amino acids released to the calponin sequence and the molecular weight by mass spectrometry (Table I) indicated that there were two major peptides in the band, calponin-(37–221) and calponin-(82–266). Because GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) binds to the calponin-(1–272) and calponin-(160–291) chymotryptic fragments, but not to the calponin-(183–290) and calponin-(7–152) fragments, the data strongly implicate the region around residues 160–182 as a region necessary for regPKCε binding. As shown in Table I, binding of GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) to areas outside of amino acids 160–291 was absent or sporadic. To confirm that calponin-(160–182) binds regPKCε, a peptide of this region was synthesized and added in increasing amounts to whole calponin in the overlay buffer. The overlay buffer was applied to a membrane containing GSTregPKCε(V1/C2). As is seen in Fig. 3 E, full-length calponin binding to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) was inhibited at calponin:peptide ratios between 1:3 and 1:30. In contrast, a scrambled version of calponin-(160–183) showed no competition with respect to the binding of calponin to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2). As shown in Fig. 1, calponin binds well to GSTPKCε(V1/C2), whereas binding to the whole GSTregPKCα construct is comparatively poor. The C2 domain of PKCε is unusual in that is does not bind calcium and shows little homology to the C2 domains of conventional isoforms. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the V1 and/or C2 domain of PKCε (but not PKCα) may be involved in the binding of calponin. Alternatively, the possibility also exists that a strong C1-C2 interaction in PKCα prevents interaction with calponin. This hypothetical interaction may or may not exist in PKCε because the C2 domain is N-terminal of the C1 domain in novel isoforms of PKC. In order to pursue further the issue of the calponin-binding domain within regPKC, truncated versions of the regulatory domain of PKCα were expressed and compared with GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) in an overlay assay. Since we had identified calponin-(160–291) from the V8 digest to contain the domain binding regPKCε, membranes containing these constructs were incubated with an overlay solution containing 1.5 μm calponin-(160–291) (Fig. 4 A). In other experiments whole calponin was used in the overlay buffer. Densitometry was performed on the bands in the overlays, normalizing for the intensity of the corresponding bands in the Coomassie-stained gels. The overlay experiment was performed twice with calponin-(160–291) in the overlay solution and three times with whole calponin. With the calponin fragment, the staining with GSTregPKCε averaged 2.9 times that for GSTregPKCα (Fig. 4 A, 2nd versus 3rd lanes). With whole calponin in the overlay solution, the staining with GSTregPKCε averaged 5.2 times that for GSTregPKCα. Thus, the binding of both the peptide and calponin was consistently stronger for GSTregPKCε than for GSTregPKCα. The binding of calponin-(160–291) to the C1A, C1B/V2, C2, and C1/V2 fragments of GSTregPKCα averaged 0.8, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.7 times that for GSTregPKCα. The binding of whole calponin to the C1A, C1B/V2, C2, and C1/V2 fragments averaged 1.9, 3.8, 5.6, and 5.1 times that for GSTregPKCα. Thus, consistently there was a pattern of lesser binding to the C1A fragment but greater binding to the C1B/V2 and C2 fragments. The above results rule out the possibility that regPKCα lacks the calponin-binding site found in regPKCε; both C1- and C2-based PKCα fragments clearly bound calponin. Given that the full PKCα regulatory domain shows less calponin binding in both full-length calponin and V8 fragment overlays, C1/C2 interactions may block the calponin-binding sites. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) fragment binds well because it is a fragment of the full PKCε regulatory domain where the C2 (calponin-binding) region is exposed. These data suggest that the calponin repeats may bind to the V1 or C2 regions of PKCε and the C1B and C2 regions of PKCα. In order to determine the relative involvement of the V1 variable region of GSTregPKCε(V1/C2) fragment, a 100-fold excess of a peptide derived from the V-1 region of PKCε (EAVSLKPT; PKCε-(14–21)) was used in an attempt to compete away calponin (Fig. 4 C). This peptide has previously been shown to inhibit translocation of novel PKCs (20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and to inhibit contraction of ferret aorta cells (12Lee Y.-H. Kim I. Laporte R. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 517: 709-720Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Neither the V1 peptide nor a scrambled V1 (LSETK PAV) peptide at a 100-fold excess were successful in reducing the amount of calponin bound to GSTregPKCε(V1/C2). Some basic proteins are able to increase PKC phosphotransferase activity in the absence of lipid activators (14Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since calponin binds to the regulatory domain of PKC, the question arises as to whether calponin might activate PKC activity. Autophosphorylation has been described as a step required for maximal activation of PKC (19el-Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation was used as one assay for PKC activation. An antibody raised against a Ser-660 phosphorylation site of PKCβII (phospho-pan-PKC antibody, New England Biolabs) was used to detect autophosphorylation. PKC was incubated with ATP for 15 s after which time the reaction was stopped by addition of sample buffer and boiling. Calponin, in the absence of lipids, induced a dramatic increase in autophosphorylation in PKCβII during the first 15 s (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were seen with protamine. Average densitometry results from three to four experiments are shown in Fig. 5 C. This antibody is reported to cross-react with the homologous site on PKCα (New England Biolabs product literature). We also observed that it cross-reacted with PKCε (Fig. 5 B), although with somewhat lower affinity. To confirm specificity, we stained blots containing recombinant PKCα, PKCβII, and PKCε with the phospho-pan-PKC antibody both in the absence (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–3) and in the presence of the peptide to which the antibody was raised (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4–6). The peptide was effective in competing away the signal in the presence of all three isoforms of PKC, consistent with the antibody recognizing the sites homologous to Ser-660 in all three cases. Similar results to those seen upon addition of calponin to PKCβII were seen with PKCε (Fig. 5 C) and PKCα (Fig. 5 D). Note that in all cases calponin increased PKC autophosphorylation as much as or more than DPBA plus PS. Thus, it appears that calponin, in the absence of lipid cofactors, promotes the autophosphorylation of PKC at a key regulatory site homologous to Ser-660 in PKCβII. To confirm that calponin promotes autophosphorylation of the kinase as well as to address the question of whether this leads to enhanced kinase activity with respect to exogenous substrates, we monitored the incorporation of 32P into these proteins in vitro as shown in Fig. 6 A. In order to minimize phosphorylation of calponin, these experiments employed the use of a mutant S175A calponin (a kind gift of Dr. Michael Walsh, University of Calgary). This mutant lacks the physiologically relevant phosphorylation site; however, it is reported that there are up to five PKC phosphorylation sites in calponin (21Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) explaining the phosphorylation observed in these experiments. Bands were obtained at the expected molecular weight for PKC, calponin, and the peptide. Note that the recombinant PKCα does possess a low level of basal activity consistent with the low level of basal autophosphorylation described in Fig. 5. However, the addition of calponin results in a clear increase in 32P incorporation into not only PKC and calponin but also the peptide substrate PKC19–31 (compare lanes 3 and4 with lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 6 A). The phosphorylation of calponin to some degree also indicates that indeed an exogenous substrate can be phosphorylated, but also raises the question of whether the phenomenon might simply be a substrate effect. Since calponin is a very basic protein and highly basic PKC substrate peptides are known to activate PKC kinase activity, the experiment shown in Fig. 6 B was performed. In this experiment, a constant amount of Ser-PKC19-31 (2 μm) was present in all lanes. As a reference, lanes 11–14 show the addition of PKC, calcium, and BSA at increasing concentrations. Lane 1shows the addition of only PKC and lane 2 only PKC and calcium. Lanes 3–6 depict the effect of adding increasing amounts of mutant calponin to the reactions. Mutant calponin increased the phosphorylation of Ser-PKC19-31 as well as the phosphorylation of calponin itself and PKC (apparent in longer exposures, Fig. 6 C).

It combines immunoprecipitation of the UV-irradiated particles under semi-denaturing conditions with primer extension analysis of the cross-linked RNA moiety. In a feasibility study, we initially identified the exact cross-linking sites of the U1 70-kDa (70K) protein in stem-loop I of U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) within purified U1 snRNPs and then confirmed the results by a large-scale preparation that allowed N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of purified cross-linked peptide-oligonucleotide complexes. We identified Tyr112 and Leu175 within the RNA-binding domain of the U1 70K protein to be cross-linked to G28 and U30 in stem-loop I, respectively. We further applied our immunoprecipitation approach to HeLa U5 snRNP, as part of purified 25 S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs. Cross-linking sites between the U5-specific 220-kDa protein (human homologue of Prp8p) and the U5 snRNA were located at multiple nucleotides within the highly conserved loop 1 and at one site in internal loop 1 of U5 snRNA. The cross-linking of four adjacent nucleotides indicates an extended interaction surface between loop 1 and the 220-kDa protein. In summary, our approach provides a rapid method for identification of RNA-protein contact sites within native snRNP particles as well as other ribonucleoprotein particles.

Assembly of the spliceosome is an ordered process and involves the interaction of U1, U2, and U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)1 particles with the intron-containing pre-mRNA and a multitude of additional spliceosomal factors (for review, see Refs. 1Krämer A.

Walke S. Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and to the quaternary arrangement both of the individual macromolecules in the U snRNP particles and of these particles in the functioning spliceosome (7Kastner B. Schenkel J. RNP Particles, Splicing and Autoimmune Diseases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 95-140Google Scholar). The U1 snRNP particle from HeLa cells has been extensively investigated in terms of RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, as it is only of moderate complexity. Thus, a relatively detailed picture of its morphology and tertiary structure (in comparison with other spliceosomal RNPs) has emerged (3Will C.L. Lührmann R. Krainer A.R. Eukaryotic mRNA Processing.

The seven common spliceosomal Sm proteins (G, E, F, D1, D2, D3, and B) assemble on the Sm site of the U1 snRNA to form a doughnut-like structure (9Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The U1 C protein does not bind directly to U1 snRNA; its interaction with the RNP is probably mediated by protein-protein interactions (17Nelissen R.L. Will C.L. van Venrooij W.J. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4113-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Except for the U1 A protein (18Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), the snRNA contact sites at the molecular level of all the other U1 snRNPs remain elusive. Much less is known about RNA-protein interactions within the other spliceosomal snRNPs. Studies have so far focused on the interaction of only a few U snRNP-specific proteins with their cognate U snRNAs,e.g. the A′ and B"" proteins with U2 snRNA (19Scherly D. Boelens W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3451-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the absence of co-crystals or binding studies with purified components, cross-linking studies add valuable information about contacts between specific snRNPs and snRNAs in assembled particles. To date, most cross-linking studies have involved the 32P labeling of the corresponding RNA, either in a random or site-specific manner. For example, the U1 70K and Sm G proteins were first identified to contact directly U1 snRNA by UV cross-linking of 32P-labeled U1 snRNP from HeLa cells (26Woppmann A. Rinke J. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10985-11004Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Heinrichs V. Hackl W. Lührmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Within other snRNP particles, site-specific cross-linking also provided the first insights into the snRNA-protein contacts. In this manner, the highly conserved U5 snRNP-specific protein Prp8p (yeast homologue of the human U5 220-kDa protein) has been shown to contact several nucleotides of U5 snRNA and at least one position of U6 snRNA in reconstituted yeast U5 and tri-snRNP particles (28Dix I. Russell C.S. O'Keefe R.T. Newman A.J. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1998; 4: 1675-1686PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vidal V.P. Verdone L. Mayes A.E. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 1470-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, no method has yet been described that allows the localization of direct RNA-protein contact sites in purified native particles. Here, we present a general approach that allows the rapid identification of RNA-protein contact sites in purified native human U snRNP particles subsequent to UV cross-linking. It combines immunoprecipitation of cross-linked proteins under semi-denaturing conditions, followed by primer extension analysis of the cross-linked RNA moiety. We initially chose native 12 S U1 snRNP isolated from HeLa cells to test the feasibility of our method since this particle is well characterized (see above). In this manner, we identified the exact cross-linking sites between the U1 70K protein and stem-loop I of U1 snRNA at the molecular level. The approach was then extended to the less well characterized 25 S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particles purified from HeLa cells. We show a direct interaction of the 220-kDa protein with the four adjacent uridines of the conserved loop 1 of U5 snRNA, suggesting an extended interaction surface between these two components. An additional cross-linking site of the 220-kDa protein in the 3′-half of internal loop (IL) 1 indicates that this protein spans the entire 5′-stem of U5 snRNA. U1, U2, and U5 snRNPs and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particles were prepared from HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Computer Cell Culture Co., Mons, Belgium) by immunoaffinity chromatography using the H20 monoclonal antibody as described previously (30Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 12 S U1 snRNPs were separated from contaminating U2 snRNPs by Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography (31Bach M. Krol A. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and stored at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in Mono Q elution buffer. 25 S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particles were obtained from the total snRNP mixture by gradient centrifugation (30Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and peak fractions were pelleted for 6 h at 70,000 rpm (TLA 100.3 rotor, Beckman Instruments). The tri-snRNP pellet was initially redissolved in 20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, and 250 mm NaCl (buffer A) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Two 25-μl droplets each containing 2.5 μg of 12 S U1 snRNP or 25 S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particles were irradiated on glass dishes at 254 nm with four 8-watt germicidal lamps (G8T5, Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany) in parallel at a distance of 4 cm for 2 min on ice. 50 μl cross-linked samples were then incubated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS for 30 min at 37 °C. The snRNAs were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen, and finally dissolved in 6.5 μl of CE buffer (20 mm cacodylate-KOH (pH 7.0) and 0.2 mm EDTA). For cross-linking experiments using isolated naked snRNAs derived from native 12 S U1 snRNP or 25 S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particles, 5 μg of the corresponding particles were treated with proteinase K, and the snRNAs were extracted and precipitated as described above. The snRNAs were dissolved in the same volume of buffer as described for the intact particles. UV cross-linking was performed as described above, and cross-linked snRNAs were again precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen and dissolved in 6.5 μl of CE buffer. Prior to UV cross-linking, 0.8–1 mg of Mono Q-purified U1 snRNPs was diluted with 12.5 ml of C buffer (32Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) without glycerol. UV cross-linking was carried out in glass dishes with an inner diameter of 12.5 cm on ice for 2 min at 254 nm at a distance of 3–4 cm from the lamps. The snRNP solutions had a depth of ∼1 mm in the glass dishes. 5 μg of cross-linked or non-cross-linked 12 S U1 snRNPs and 25 S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particles were incubated with 1% (w/v) SDS for 5 min at 70 °C. After cooling to room temperature, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v), and the volume was adjusted to 350 μl with phosphate-buffered saline (NaCl (pH 8.0)). The samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with different antibodies against U1 or U5 snRNP-specific proteins bound to 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensively washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the beads were incubated with proteinase K at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 100 μl of buffer A containing 1% (w/v) SDS for 1 h at 37 °C. Cross-linked snRNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol as described above, and finally dissolved in 3.5 μl of CE buffer. The successful identification of specific cross-linking sites (see below) was strictly dependent on the denaturing conditions prior to immunoprecipitation. Changing the immunoprecipitation conditions,e.g. dissociation of the particles in the presence of 1% SDS and then dilution to a final concentration of 0.05% SDS, does not allow the detection of specific RNA-protein interactions in cases where the protein itself is involved in strong protein-protein interactions (for example, the U5 220- and 116-kDa proteins; see “Results”). Accordingly, immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the U5 116-kDa protein under such conditions coprecipitates the U5 220-kDa proteins (data not shown). Primer extension analysis of U1 and U5 snRNAs derived from cross-linked 12 S U1 snRNP and 25 S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particles, respectively, or obtained after immunoprecipitation was performed with a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 63–77 of U1 snRNA and nucleotides 83–103 of U5 snRNA. Primer extension analysis using 2 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Seikagaku) per reaction was carried out as essentially described (33Hartmuth K. Raker V.A. Huber J. Branlant C. Lührmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding loading buffer (50% (w/v) urea, 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (pH 8.3), 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol) and boiling for 3 min. Sequencing ladders were generated from in vitro U1 and U5 snRNA transcripts (Ribomax, Promega) using 0.5 mm dideoxy-NTPs under identical conditions. Transcripts were separated on a 50% (w/v) urea and 9.6% polyacrylamide (20:1) sequencing gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA (pH 8.3) and exposed to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with two intensifying screens for 1 day (for Figs. 2 A and 8 A) or 6 days (for Figs. 2 B and 8 B).Figure 5MALDI-MS analysis of the U1 70K tryptic peptide (173RVLVDVER180) cross-linked via Leu175 to an RNase T1 fragment (29AUCACG34) in stem-loop I of U1 snRNA.A, mass spectrum of the RP-HPLC-purified fraction containing two U1 70K tryptic fragments (173RVLVDVER180and 107VARVNYDTTESKL119) cross-linked to U1 snRNA T1 oligonucleotides.

C, nucleotide composition of the U1 snRNA T1 oligonucleotide cross-linked to the U1 70K tryptic fragment (173RVLVDVER180). The nucleotide composition (fourth column) was determined from mass peaks a–f as shown in A and B. The cross-linked U1 70K peptide sequence (fragment 173–180) and its mass ([M + H]+) are also listed (third column). The cross-link site within the peptide (Leu175) as identified by Edman degradation is underlined (see Fig. 3).Y denotes pyrimidines C and U. Note that C and U differ by only 1 mass unit (323 and 324, respectively). Since MALDI-MS in the linear mode does not allow the unambiguous differentiation between C and U, different compositions of the cross-linked oligonucleotide were considered. Hence, the calculated mass (second column) is given as the average of all possible combinations of C and U residues within the oligonucleotide concerned. The mass of the cross-linked T1 oligonucleotide was calculated as 1937.5 ± 1.5. The mass difference of 97.1 ± 1.5 between the measured mass of peak a (A; 3020.2) and the calculated mass of 2923.1 ± 1.5 (985.6 + (1937.5 ± 1.5) = 2923.1 ± 1.5) is due to the interaction of four Mg2+ ions with the complex (fourth column). The calculated mass of the total complex (second column) therefore includes the masses of four Mg2+ ions ((2923.1 ± 1.5) + 97.2 = 3020.3 ± 1.5). Furthermore, the partial hydrolysis of the cross-linked complex resulted in fragments that have 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini (mass peaks b, d, and f), which is indicated as −H2 O in thefourth column.

Size-exclusion chromatography separated snRNAs and snRNAs that carry cross-linked peptides from the non-cross-linked peptide moiety. Cross-link-enriched snRNAs were digested with endoproteinase T1 or A, and cross-linked peptide-oligonucleotide complexes were then separated by RP-HPLC. RP-HPLC fractions with absorbances at 220 and 260 nm were collected and analyzed by automated N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS analysis. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed the cross-linked amino acid because a gap in the analysis of the Edman degradation products occurs at the site of the cross-linked amino acid (37Urlaub H.

U1 snRNPs were dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mm dithioerythritol; heated for 5 min at 90 °C; and allowed to cool to room temperature. The U1 snRNP solution was diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2 until the urea concentration was below 1 m. Endoproteolytic cleavage of spliceosomal proteins within the U1 snRNP solution was carried out with trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4; Promega) or chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 for 16 h at 37 °C. The U1 snRNP particles were then precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol; washed with 80% ethanol; air-dried; and dissolved in an appropriate volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA containing 8 m urea. The samples were injected onto a Superose 12 size-exclusion column (10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) running with the same buffer conditions at a flow rate of 400 μl/min. The absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. An aliquot of each fraction was precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone and analyzed by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent silver staining. snRNA-containing fractions were pooled and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol, washed with 80% ethanol, and dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 2.5 mmEDTA. snRNAs were digested with 10 μg of RNase A or 10 μg of RNase T1 (Ambion, Inc.) for 2 h at 50 °C. The snRNA oligonucleotide pool was subjected to a second incubation with 1 μg of the respective endoproteinases for 16 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by injection onto an RP-HPLC C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) running at 5% solvent B. Solvent A was water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile and 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid. Isolation of the cross-linked peptide-oligonucleotide heteromers was achieved at a flow rate of 100 μl/min with the following gradients: first, isocratic elution at 5% solvent B for 30 min, then 5–45% solvent B for 120 min, and finally 45–90% solvent B for 20 min. An additional isocratic step that varied in time was performed at 10% solvent B until the base line was reached. The absorbance was monitored at 220 and 260 nm. Fractions with absorbances at both 220 and 260 nm were dried under vacuum and subjected to automated N-terminal sequence analysis in a PROCISETM protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) and to MALDI-MS analysis. MALDI-MS of the cross-linked peptide-oligonucleotide complexes was performed essentially under conditions described previously (34Urlaub H. Thiede B. Müller E.C. Brimacombe R. Wittmann-Liebold B. J.

Our method for the identification of RNA-protein contact sites in native snRNP particles from HeLa cell nuclear extracts combines (i) UV cross-linking, (ii) immunoprecipitation of cross-linked proteins under semi-denaturing conditions, and (iii) primer extension analysis of the cross-linked snRNA moiety in the precipitate. The overall strategy is schematically outlined in Fig. 1 for U1 snRNP. UV cross-linking at 254 nm of an RNP particle generates a direct cross-link between a specific protein and an RNA base whenever the two components occupy favorable relative positions. In the first experiment (Fig. 1 A), dissociation of the cross-linked particle and subsequent digestion with proteinase K are followed by identification of the exact cross-linking site by primer extension analysis. Cross-linked nucleotides are detected as discrete reverse transcriptase stops because a few amino acid residues of the cross-linked protein always remain covalently attached to the base of the RNA. The actual cross-linking site is interpreted as occurring one nucleotide upstream from the stop site of the reverse transcriptase. As an initial approach to distinguish between stops due to intra- and inter-RNA cross-links or UV-induced RNA strand breaks and those stops that are due to a cross-linked protein, cross-linking experiments were carried out with naked RNAs isolated from purified RNP particles.

Smad1 transduces bone morphogenetic protein signals, inducing formation of ventral mesoderm in Xenopus embryos, whereas Smad2 transduces activin/TGF-β signals, generating dorsal mesoderm. Calmodulin directly binds to many Smads and was shown to down-regulate Smad2 activity in a cell culture system (Zimmerman, C. M., Kariapper, M. S. T., and Mathews, L. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 677–680). Here, we extend those data and demonstrate that calmodulin alters Smad signaling in living embryos, increasing Smad1 activity while inhibiting Smad2 function. To characterize this regulation, we undertook a structure-function analysis and found that calmodulin binds to two distinct and conserved regions in both Smad1 and Smad2. Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling also modifies Smad activity (Kretzschmar, M., Doody, J., and Massagué, J. (1997)Nature 389, 618–622; Kretzschmar, M., Doody, J., Timokhina, I., and Massagué, J.

We show that calmodulin binding to Smads inhibits subsequent Erk2-dependent phosphorylation of Smads and vice versa.

Structurally, Smads consist of two highly conserved globular amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (Mad homology (MH) domain 1 and 2, respectively) that are connected via a divergent linker region. The vertebrate Smads can be divided into three classes. Pathway-restricted Smads (Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8) are phosphorylated by the serine kinase receptors upon ligand stimulation (27Massague J. Annu. Rev.

The discovery that Smads are signal transduction molecules involved in physiological responses to extracellular signals has increased the focus of research on Smad regulation with two signaling systems possibly involved, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) (1Zimmerman C.M.

For example, cell culture-based experiments have shown that stimulation of RTK pathways, via Erk2, leads to increased phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad2 (2Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J.

The linker region of Smad1 contains several canonical Erk sites (PXSP) that become phosphorylated after epidermal growth factor stimulation of R-1B/L17 cells and by Erk2 in vitro(2Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this phosphorylation, nuclear accumulation of Smad1 is inhibited, thus blocking Smad1 activity. Smad2 and Smad3 are also substrates for Erk2, and one report showed that epidermal growth factor stimulation of Mv1Lu cells partially excluded these Smads from the nucleus and hence decreased their function (3Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). These data contrast with an earlier report in which Erk2-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 increased both nuclear localization and activity of Smad2 (4de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition to the RTK cascade, another major signaling pathway, calcium/calmodulin, has also been suggested to alter Smad function. It was recently reported that calmodulin binds to the amino-terminal half of several Smads including Smad1 and Smad2 (1Zimmerman C.M. Kariapper M.S.T. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This binding might have functional consequences as inhibiting calmodulin increased activin-dependent induction of marker gene expression in L17 mink lung epithelial cells, whereas overexpression of calmodulin decreased activin- and TGF-β-dependent induction of a transcriptional reporter (1Zimmerman C.M. Kariapper M.S.T. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). From these data, it was concluded that calmodulin negatively regulates Smad2 and hence activin/TGF-β signaling. These observations prompted us to examine the functional relationship between calmodulin binding and Erk2 phosphorylation of Smads. In the present study, we show the following: 1) calmodulin increases the activity of Smad1 and decreases the activity of Smad2 inXenopus embryos and explants; 2) Smad1 and Smad2 have two calmodulin-binding sites in their MH1 domains; and 3) calmodulin binding and Erk2 phosphorylation are reciprocally regulated in vitro. Taken together, these observations provide further evidence for cross-talk between Ca2+/CaM, TGF-β, and RTK signaling. Embryos were obtained, microinjected, and cultured, and animal caps were dissected, cultured, and harvested as described (47LeSueur J.A. Graff J.M. Development. 1999; 126: 137-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were either uninjected (control) or injected with mRNA as described in the figure legends. The Smad1 and Smad2 full-length constructs used for making synthetic mRNA have been described previously (16Graff J.M. Bansal A. Melton D.A.

The calmodulin construct used for making synthetic mRNA, a generous gift of Lawrence Mathews, was linearized with BamHI. Capped mRNA was transcribed in vitro as described (48Krieg P.A. Melton D.

Deletion constructs of Smad1 and Smad2 were prepared by subcloning the corresponding PCR fragments into pCS2+ at the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. PCR reactions consisted of primer, plasmid template, 5 μl of 10× Vent DNA polymerase buffer, 2.5 μl of dNTP mix (5 mm each), 40.5 μl of H2O, and 0.5 μl of Vent DNA polymerase (Promega). PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94 °C, 19 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 5 min at 72 °C. The reaction products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated into the predigested vector.

https://openalex.org/W2016986518,"Cross-talk between integrin-mediated adhesion and growth factors has been described in many recent studies; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We report here that detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix induced a decrease in both the autophosphorylation and protein levels of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGF-R β), which was completely reversed upon replating cells on fibronectin. The effect occurred in all cells examined but to a greater extent in primary fibroblasts compared with established cell lines. Decreased PDGF-R levels in suspended cells correlated with ubiquitination of the PDGF-R and was blocked by treatment with inhibitors of the proteasome pathway. Unlike PDGF-induced down-regulation, detachment-induced degradation did not require receptor autophosphorylation, internalization, or tyrosine kinase activity. We conclude that cell detachment results in cellular desensitization to PDGF that is mediated by degradation of the PDGF-R via a novel ubiquitin-dependent pathway.

Integrins act coordinately with growth factors to regulate migration, growth or differentiation, and survival (reviewed in Ref. 1Schwartz M.A. Baron V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For instance, several recent studies reported a synergistic effect of PDGF1 and cell adhesion on autophosphorylation of the PDGF-R and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (2Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 3Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Moreover, PDGF induces the association of its phosphorylated receptor with integrin αvβ3 in fibroblasts plated on vitronectin, which correlates with enhanced PDGF-induced cell proliferation (4Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These effects appear to contribute to the anchorage dependence of growth (1Schwartz M.A. Baron V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). PDGF-Rs are transmembrane tyrosine kinases that mediate the effects of PDGF on growth and motility in cell types including fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (5Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 6Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar, 7Claesson-Welsh L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two structurally related receptors, α and β, possess different affinities for the A and B PDGF isoforms and generate similar though not identical cellular responses. Thus, both the α and β receptors stimulate cell proliferation, membrane ruffling, and loss of actin stress fibers, but only the β receptor promotes chemotaxis (5Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 6Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of PDGF to its receptor induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on several tyrosine residues, which provide docking sites for SH2-containing molecules, thereby initiating a variety of signaling pathways. c-Cbl, one of the numerous proteins that bind to the PDGF-R (8Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has recently been identified as a proteasomal E3-like ubiquitin ligase that is involved in down-regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors (9Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.

PDGF-induced down-regulation is a complex process that involves receptor internalization through clathrin-coated pits and requires the receptor tyrosine kinase activity (12Heldin C.H. Wasteson A. Westermark B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4216-4221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sorkin A. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The 100-kDa GTPase dynamin is responsible for pinching off of the vesicles, which results in the delivery of receptors to lysosomes, where both the ligand and the extracellular domain of the receptor are degraded (reviewed in Ref. 14Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). C-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination is also reported to target receptors for degradation by the proteasome (15Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Hence, cells become less sensitive to PDGF following down-regulation of the PDGF-R. In the present study, we provide evidence for degradation of the PDGF-R in cells detached from the substratum. Receptor degradation was preceded by ubiquitination and was blocked by proteasome inhibitors. However, detachment-induced degradation is distinct from ligand-induced down-regulation because the former did not require the presence of PDGF and was independent of receptor tyrosine kinase activity and receptor internalization. These results may therefore provide a novel mechanism by which integrins potentiate the cellular effects of PDGF. PDGF-BB was from Life Technologies, Inc. Calpain inhibitor II and AG1296 were from Calbiochem.Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth, PA). Chloroquine, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Fibronectin was prepared from human plasma as previously described (16Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed using primary fibroblasts derived from p53−/− mouse embryos (murine embryo fibroblast cells) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 7% CO2. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes until confluence and starved for 2 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Other cell lines were used where indicated. They were grown in similar conditions, except for the human primary fibroblasts, which were grown in 15% serum. For transfection, cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes at 300,000 cells/dish. The next day, cells were transfected with 1 μg of cDNA/dish using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was routinely 20–30% of cells. Cells were used 48 h after transfection. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing dynamin-2 K44A (a dominant-negative form of dynamin) and a tetracycline-sensitive transactivator were used to co-infect cells for 2 h with 200 plaque-forming units/cell in phosphate-buffered saline (17Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). They were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and complete medium was added with or without 20 ng/ml tetracycline. After 24 h the cells were starved for 4 h before use in suspension experiments. Cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at room temperature and then placed on ice. Ice-cold medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 250 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to stop trypsinization, and cells were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 2 min and washed once. They were finally resuspended in 3 ml of the same medium and maintained in suspension at 37 °C in the incubator for the indicated periods of time, with occasional agitation to prevent clumping. Attached or suspended cells were chilled on ice and washed twice with ice-cold buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 200 μm vanadate. Cells were solubilized in the same buffer also containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μm leupeptin. After 30 min, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Samples containing 200 μg of cellular protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation using 4 μg of anti-PDGF-R antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), which were preadsorbed on protein A-agarose (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were conducted at 4 °C for 4 h, and precipitates were washed three times in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Additionally, whole cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblots were blocked with 5% fat-free milk and incubated with the following primary antibodies: 0.05 μg/ml polyclonal anti-PDGF-R β (sc-432), 0.2 μg/ml monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (sc-8017), 0.1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-His tag antibodies (sc-803) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 1/4000 ascites of the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 11C10. Following washing, blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against mouse or rabbit IgG at 0.3 μg/ml (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). Immunoblots were developed using luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Stripping of membranes was performed at 65 °C for 1 h in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, 0.5 m Nacl, 1% SDS, 0.5% Tween 20. To detect possible interactions between cell adhesion and PDGF-R function, primary murine embryo fibroblasts were maintained in serum-free medium for 2 h either attached or in suspension. The β isoform of the PDGF-R was then analyzed in response to increasing concentrations of PDGF-BB, which specifically binds to this receptor. Western blotting of whole cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine revealed a major protein of 185 kDa corresponding to the size of the PDGF receptor that was induced by PDGF (Fig. 1). As described previously (2Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of the PDGF-R was dramatically decreased in suspended cells compared with attached cells. As expected, a band of approximately 120 kDa that showed dramatic dephosphorylation in suspended cells but only a slight response to PDGF most likely represents focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (18Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Guan J.L. Shalloway D.

A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). At 10 ng/ml PDGF, autophosphorylation of PDGF-R in suspended cells was 27 ± 8% (n = 3) of the response in adherent cells. Probing with antibodies to the PDGF-R revealed an unexpected decrease in total receptor levels as well. Because the level of FAK was somewhat higher in suspended cells, we conclude that both autophosphorylation and levels of the PDGF receptor were specifically decreased in suspended cells. To test whether this effect is cell type-specific, other cell lines were examined. Primary murine embryo fibroblast cells, NIH 3T3, Swiss 3T3, 10T1/2, BHK, and normal diploid human fibroblasts all showed some decrease in PDGF-R levels and autophosphorylation in suspended cells, but the extent of the effect varied (Table I). Primary fibroblasts were the most sensitive, with phosphorylation and receptor levels in suspended cells that were less than 25% compared with attached cells. By contrast, immortalized cell lines still showed substantial receptor autophosphorylation when suspended. It should be noted, however, that the changes in receptor phosphorylation did not precisely correlate with receptor levels in all of the cell lines, suggesting that additional mechanisms may regulate receptor phosphorylation. These results are consistent with past studies of these cell lines demonstrating that growth factors still induced a subset of normal signaling events in suspended cells (3Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D.

The reversibility of these effects was tested by replating the cells onto dishes coated with fibronectin. Replating induced an increase of PDGF-induced receptor phosphorylation, which was detectable at 30 min of replating and was optimal after 3 h (Fig. 2). Interestingly, receptor phosphorylation was higher 3 and 4 h after replating on fibronectin than in stably attached cells. A corresponding recovery of receptor levels was also observed. These data demonstrate that loss of PDGF-R was completely reversible and are consistent with published studies demonstrating that replating cells on extracellular matrix proteins can potentiate growth factor responses more effectively than stable cell adhesion (23Leng J. Klemke R.L. Reddy A.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37855-37861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To detect events that precede degradation, cells were detached and kept in serum-free medium for 5, 15, 60, or 120 min, including stimulation with 5 ng/ml PDGF during the last 5 min. Immunoblotting of anti-PDGF-R immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that PDGF-R phosphorylation was not impaired after 5 or 15 min but was substantially diminished after 1 or 2 h (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in addition to the 185-kDa receptor, a higher molecular weight band was immunoprecipitated by the anti-PDGF-R antibody after 5 and 15 min in suspension, indicative of a covalent modification of the receptor. A similar shift due to ubiquitination of the receptor has been described after exposure of cells to PDGF. Although smearing due to polyubiquitination has been reported for many proteins, it has been previously reported that much of the ubiquitinated PDGF-R runs as a sharp band at a similar molecular weight to what we observed (24Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reprobing with an antibody against ubiquitin revealed a reactive band in cells that had been in suspension for 5 and 15 min that co-migrated with the upper band in the anti-phosphotyrosine blots. Ubiquitination is known to be involved in the degradation of the PDGF-R (25Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the decrease in receptor amounts induced by detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix is likely to result from ubiquitin-dependent receptor degradation. To test whether detachment-induced receptor ubiquitination and degradation required PDGF, cells were detached and maintained in suspension in the absence of PDGF for increasing periods. Immunoblotting of PDGF-R immunoprecipitates with anti-receptor antibodies showed that degradation occurred rapidly in the absence of added PDGF (Fig. 4 A). However, ubiquitination was difficult to detect consistently under these experimental conditions. To increase the sensitivity of the assay, cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a His6tagged-ubiquitin. When probed with an antibody to the epitope tag, ubiquitination of the unstimulated receptor was readily detected (Fig. 4 B). Ubiquitination occurred as soon as cells were detached, reached a maximum level between 5 and 30 min, and decreased after 2 h, concomitant with loss of the receptor. In some experiments, blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, which confirmed that the receptor was not phosphorylated under these conditions (data not shown). We conclude that ubiquitination and degradation of the PDGF receptor constitute a ligand-independent process induced by loss of cell adhesion. However, ligand binding to the receptor accelerated and further increased the rate of degradation (Fig. 4 C). To ensure that degradation of the PDGF-R was not due to trypsinization, cells were detached without trypsin by gently scraping with a rubber policeman. Detachment via this method induced ubiquitination at 15 min, followed by a decrease in PDGF receptor levels at 2 h (Fig. 5 A), similar to trypsinization. As before, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor was detected (data not shown). We also examined cells treated with an RGD-containing peptide, which inhibits integrin binding to their ligands and thus induces cell detachment. RGE peptide was used as a negative control. After 20 min of RGD treatment, cells started to round up and were usually detached after 60 min (data not shown). Ubiquitination of the receptor was clearly observed between 20 and 30 min (Fig. 5 B), and degradation occurred slightly later, with about 50% of the receptor being lost after 45 min of RGD treatment. These data indicate that PDGF-R degradation is a consequence of loss of integrin-mediated interactions and is not due to trypsinization. The observation that PDGF binding to the receptor was not required for detachment-induced degradation indicated that it could be independent of the receptor tyrosine kinase. Thus, we examined the specific inhibitor AG1296, which completely blocked PDGF-R kinase activity under these experimental conditions (data not shown). As a control, attached cells were stimulated with PDGF for 60 min to induce down-regulation of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 6, tyrphostin AG1296 inhibited ligand-induced down-regulation but had no effect on suspension-induced degradation. Thus, detachment-induced degradation does not require receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand-induced down-regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors involves receptor internalization and sorting to the lysosomes for degradation (12Heldin C.H. Wasteson A. Westermark B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4216-4221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ubiquitination targets the receptor to the proteasome (15Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To assess the contributions of these pathways, we used a variety of inhibitors. Two inhibitors of the proteasome, calpain inhibitor II (50 μm) and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (20 μm), prevented degradation of the PDGF-R in suspended cells but had little effect on ligand-induced down-regulation (Fig. 7 A). Although calpain inhibitor II has cross-reactivity with calpain and possibly with lysosomal enzymes, the clasto-lactacystin β-lactone is highly specific for the proteasome. In contrast, chloroquine, which specifically inhibits lysosomal degradation, had no effect on loss of PDGF-R in suspended cells but blocked PDGF-induced receptor degradation (Fig. 7 B). This result indicates that loss of the PDGF-R in suspended cells is independent of the lysosomal pathway but is strongly dependent on proteasome activity. To determine whether receptor internalization is required for suspension-induced degradation, cells were incubated at 4 °C to decrease membrane trafficking. As expected, low temperature prevented PDGF-induced down-regulation of the receptor (Fig. 8 A). Remarkably, low temperature did not prevent receptor degradation following suspension. To further test the requirement for internalization, we expressed dynamin-2 mutated at lysine 44, which abolishes the GTPase activity of the protein. This construct functions as a dominant negative to prevent endocytosis of coated-pit vesicles, which instead accumulate at the cell surface (26Damke H. Baba T. Warnok D. Schmid S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Cells were co-infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing dynamin-2 K44A and a tetracyclin-sensitive transactivator (17Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the presence of tetracycline, the mutant dynamin was not expressed, and ligand-dependent as well as suspension-induced degradation of the receptor was observed (Fig. 8 B). In the absence of tetracycline, when the HA-dynamin mutant was expressed, ligand-induced PDGF-R down-regulation was blocked, whereas receptor degradation still occurred in suspended cells. These results indicate that internalization is not required for PDGF-R degradation in suspended cells. Integrins and PDGF act synergistically to modulate cell proliferation and migration. One of the first steps in the collaborative pathway is the enhancement of PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity induced by cell adhesion (27Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Our data show that disruption of cell adhesion resulted in a dramatic decrease of PDGF-R autophosphorylation and a similar decrease of receptor levels due to degradation. Although this effect occurred in all of the cell lines tested, the extent showed significant variations, with primary or diploid fibroblasts being more sensitive than immortalized cell lines. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the mechanism of suspension-induced degradation of the PDGF-R is distinct from that of ligand-induced down-regulation. Thus, PDGF-stimulated receptor down-regulation requires receptor tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation. By contrast, degradation in suspended cells was independent of the receptor kinase and was not correlated with its phosphorylation. Moreover, ligand-induced down-regulation involves receptor internalization (12Heldin C.H. Wasteson A. Westermark B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4216-4221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sorkin A. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and is sensitive to the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (25Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas in degradation suspended cells were not blocked by treatments that inhibit internalization or lysosomal degradation. On the other hand, both pathways share a dependence on ubiquitination (Ref. 25Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar and this study). Ubiquitin is a highly conserved polypeptide of 76 amino acids that is conjugated via its carboxyl-terminal carboxyl group to the amino-terminal group of a lysine in the acceptor protein (reviewed in Ref. 28DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is first activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. It is then transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, which promotes its binding to a protein together with the ubiquitin-ligase E3. It is now accepted that single and poly-ubiquitins act as functionally distinct signals. Thus, poly-ubiquitin chains of at least four molecules (29Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) target the protein to a large protease complex called the 26 S proteasome. The molecular mechanism of targeting involves a dramatic increase in affinity, with Ub4 being the shortest chain that binds with high affinity to the proteasome (30Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In contrast, a single ubiquitin is only a weak signal for degradation by the proteasome but serves to trigger internalization of cell surface proteins into the endocytic pathway (reviewed in Ref. 31Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Indeed, resolution of the three-dimensional structure of folded ubiquitin has recently revealed an internalization signal that is sufficient to promote endocytosis of proteins to which it is linked (32Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the PDGF-R is modified with multiple ubiquitin molecules (24Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor contains several lysine residues, it is unknown whether the modified receptor carries only long ubiquitin chains or includes mono-ubiquitins on different lysines. The result that PDGF triggers ubiquitin-dependent receptor degradation via both proteasomes and lysosomes (25Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) suggests that under these conditions the PDGF-R contains mixtures of poly- and mono-ubiquitins. Graphic determinations of the sizes of the PDGF-R and the Ub-PDGF-R resulted in apparent molecular masses of 190,000 and 220,000–230,000 kDa, respectively. This gain of 30,000–40,000 kDa corresponds to the addition of at least four ubiquitin molecules. Because it appears as a sharp band instead of a smear, we think it likely that a single poly-ubiquitin chain is appended to the PDGF-R in suspended cells. As discussed above, the addition of four ubiquitins would allow targeting of the receptor to the proteasome but would not trigger internalization, consistent with our observations. It has been proposed that poly-ubiquitin linked to the cytoplasmic domain of membrane-bound proteins could recruit the 26 S proteasome to the membrane compartment (discussed in Ref. 33Hirsch C. Ploegh H.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The proteasome might also extract the protein from the membrane, with the ATPase of the regulatory subunits providing the required energy. Therefore, whereas ligand-induced down-regulation includes both lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways and occurs during the transit of the receptor through the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, we hypothesize that in suspended cells receptors are degraded by the proteasome primarily at the plasma membrane. Ligand-stimulated ubiquitination of the PDGF receptor is mediated by the phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of the SH2 domain-containing protein Cbl (15Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Once associated with the phosphorylated receptor, Cbl triggers the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to the receptor and therefore functions as a proteasomal E3-like ubiquitin ligase (9Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 10Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, receptor phosphorylation was not observed in suspended cells, and the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF-R was not required for degradation. Thus, Cbl is not a likely mediator of degradation in suspended cells. The mechanism by which integrins target the PDGF-R for degradation via the proteasome system is currently unknown. Loss of cell adhesion is usually thought to trigger termination of cell signals and protein activities. For instance, suspended cells show low activities of GTPases, such as Ras, Rac, and Cdc42, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the protein tyrosine kinases FAK and Src (34Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 35Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 36Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). According to this view, it would appear unlikely that detachment sends a signal to activate degradation. Instead, integrins may normally prevent the PDGF-R from constitutive degradation by inhibiting its targeting to the proteasome. However, there is evidence that unoccupied integrins can in fact transmit signals that inhibit cell proliferation (36Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 37Symington B.E. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Varner J.A. Emerson D.A. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 725-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Degradation of PDGF receptors could therefore be actively triggered by unoccupied integrins following loss of contact with extracellular matrix proteins. Many recent studies have identified various mechanisms of cross-talk between integrins and growth factor receptors that result in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, or survival. It is now well known that integrins stimulate many signaling cascades that are shared by growth factor receptors, for example, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (34Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 35Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 39Meredith Jr., J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Concomitant activation of these pathways would lead to a critical level of activation needed to induce proliferation or differentiation. In addition, integrins appear to associate with and modulate the activity of tyrosine kinase receptors, leading to enhanced growth factor signals (1Schwartz M.A. Baron V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 40Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). This work therefore identifies a new mode of cross-talk in which integrins modulate the very first step of PDGF signaling by altering the number of responsive PDGF receptors at the cell surface. These effects very likely all contribute to the anchorage dependence of cell survival and growth, mechanisms that are essential to the integrity of multicellular organisms (34Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 35Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin.

Derivatives biotinylated at the C-17 (BR-1) and C-11 (BR-6) positions retained the activity of morphological reversion in v-src-transformed 3Y1 fibroblasts. Two radicicol-binding proteins, 120 and 90-kDa in size, were detected in HeLa cell extracts by employing BR-1 and BR-6, respectively. The 90-kDa protein bound to BR-6 was identified to be Hsp90 by immunoblotting. The 120-kDa protein bound to BR-1 was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and its internal amino acid sequence was identical to that of human and rat ATP citrate lyase. The identity of the 120-kDa protein as ATP citrate lyase was confirmed by immunoblotting. Interaction between BR-1 and ATP citrate lyase was blocked by radicicol but not by herbimycin A that interacts with Hsp90. These results suggest that radicicol binds the two proteins through different molecular portions of its structure. BR-1-bound ATP citrate lyase isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate showed no enzymatic activity. The activity of rat liver ATP citrate lyase was inhibited by radicicol and BR-1 but not by BR-6.

Delmotte-Plaquee J. Nature. 1953; 171: 344Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), is a compound showing a variety of biological activities. It was reported again as a potent tranquilizer with low toxicity in 1964 (2McCapra F. Scott A.I. Delmotte P. Delmotte-Plaquee J. Bhacca N.S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1964; 15: 869-875Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We rediscovered radicicol as a potent inducer of reversal of the transformed phenotype in v-src-transformed fibroblasts to the normal one (3Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Biosci.

We also showed that radicicol caused cell cycle arrest in G1and G2 phases, and Oikawa et al. (5Oikawa T. Ito H. Ashino H. Toi M. Tominaga T. Morita I. Murota S. Eur. J.

Furthermore, radicicol was reported to induce morphological reversion of not only src but also ras, mos,raf, fos, and SV40-transformed cell lines and inhibited the expression of mitogen-inducible cyclooxygenase in macrophages (6Kwon H.J.

Recently, KF25706, a novel oxime derivative of radicicol, was reported to show potent antitumor activity and is currently under consideration as an anticancer drug (10Soga S. Neckers L.M.

Thein vivo inhibition of tyrosine kinases and MAP kinases has been suggested to be involved in these characteristic phenotypes elicited by radicicol (6Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Muroya K. Hattori S.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of gelsolin, an actin regulatory protein, has also been observed during the induction of morphological changes in various transformed cells (11Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Nagaoka R. Obinata T. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2625-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that radicicol disrupted the Ras-activated signaling pathway by selectively depleting Raf kinase or reducing Ras/Raf molecular interaction (12Soga S. Kozawa T. Narumi H.

The target molecule of radicicol was proposed to be Hsp90, because it strongly binds Hsp90 in a manner competitive with ATP and geldanamycin, a known Hsp90 inhibitor (14Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D. Neckers L.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 15Sharma S.V. Agatsuma T. Nakano H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear whether Hsp90 is the only protein targeted by radicicol. To identify radicicol-binding proteins using affinity matrix, we synthesized several biotinylated radicicol derivatives and used them for purification of radicicol-binding proteins. This strategy has been successfully employed in identifying the target molecules of several natural products such as fumagillin (16Sin N. Meng L. Wang M.Q. Wen J.J. Bornmann W.G. Crews C.M. Proc.

We show here that radicicol binds not only Hsp90 but also ATP citrate lyase (ACL),1 a key enzyme that produces acetyl-CoA in the cytosolic compartment. ACL is required for both fatty acid and sterol syntheses. These lipids and lipid-modified molecules play important roles in many cellular and tissue functions including signal transduction and protein membrane sorting. We suggest that the inhibition of ACL, in addition to Hsp90, contributes to some extent to a variety of biological effects of radicicol. A palmitoyl derivative of radicicol (Fig. 1, derivative 2): a solution of radicicol (105 mg, 0.29 mmol), 16-hydroxypalmitic acid (79 mg, 0.29 mmol), DCC (105 mg, 0.51 mmol), and DMAP (10 mg, 0.08 mmol) in dichloromethane was stirred at room temperature overnight.

The reaction mixture was poured into saturated NH4Cl solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The same workup as with derivative 2 and silica gel chromatography gave 15-O-alkylated radicicol (217 mg, 54%) as a colorless powder and unreacted radicicol (85 mg, 28%). A solution of 15-O-alkylated radicicol (179 mg, 0.37 mmol) in DMF (16 ml) was treated with NaN3 (36 mg, 0.55 mmol) and stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The same workup as above and silica gel chromatography gave an azide (88 mg, 53%) as a colorless powder and a recovered starting material (40 mg, 22%).

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, and poured into saturated NH4Cl solution. After extraction with ethyl acetate, preparative silica gel TLC gave biotinylated BR-2 (4 mg, 14%).

After concentration, silica gel chromatography gave a 1,4-adduct (85 mg, 67%) as colorless powder. This compound (35 mg, 0.073 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (1 ml) and was added to biotinylbis-ε-aminocaproic acid (35 mg, 0.072 mmol) and tri-n-butylphosphine (18 μl, 0.072 mmol) at −78 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. After concentration, preparative silica gel TLC gave BR-5 (10 mg, 15%) as a colorless powder. To a solution of radicicol (150 mg, 0.41 mmol) in THF (3 ml) was added dropwise a solution of PhSLi in THF (0.2 mm, 2.0 ml, 0.40 mmol) at −78 °C under argon and stirred at −78 °C for 4 days. The reaction mixture was poured into saturated NH4Cl solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The same workup as above and silica gel chromatography gave a 1,4-adduct (130 mg, 67%) as colorless powder with a trace 1,6-adduct. This 1,4-adduct (100 mg, 0.21 mmol), 3-aminooxypropyl-1-azide (200 mg, 1.72 mmol) and acetic acid (100 μl) were dissolved in benzene, and the mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 5 days. After concentration, silica gel chromatography gave an oxime derivative (119 mg, 98%) as colorless powder. To a solution of the oxime derivative (119 mg, 0.21 mmol) in dichloromethane (2 ml) was dropped a solution ofm-chloroperbenzoic acid (36 mg, 0.21 mmol) at −78 °C, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. The reaction mixture was poured into 10% aq. Na2S2O4/saturated NaHCO3 (1:1). After extraction with ethyl acetate, the extract was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (2 ml) and refluxed in the presence of calcium carbonate (50 mg, 0.50 mmol) for 5 h. After filtration and concentration, silica gel chromatography gave an oxime of radicicol (52 mg, 57%) as a colorless powder. This compound (52 mg, 0.12 mmol) was dissolved in THF (5 ml) and added to 20% solution of triethylphosphine in toluene (80 μl, 0.14 mmol) at −78 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred overnight. After concentration, preparative silica gel TLC gave an amine (30 mg, 58%) as a colorless powder. To a solution of the amine (14 mg, 0.032 mmol) and biotinylbis-ε-aminocaproic acid (15 mg, 0.031 mmol) in DMF (1 ml) were added HBTU (12 mg, 0.032 mmol) and N-ethylmorpholine (5 μl, 0.039 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 days and poured into saturated NH4Cl solution. After extraction, the same workup as before and preparative silica gel TLC gave BR-6 (4 mg, 14%) as colorless powder. The structures of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (not shown). Radicicol used in this study was kindly provided by Drs. Y. Sugimura and K. Tanzawa. HeLa cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized with a glass teflon homogenizer in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. After the supernatant of HeLa cells or rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) had been precleared by incubating with immobilized streptavidin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for 60 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, the cleared supernatants were incubated with biotinylated radicicol derivatives in the presence or absence of radicicol as a competitor. After incubation for 60 min at 4 °C, proteins associated with the biotinylated radicicol derivatives were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose. The pellet was washed with washing buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ng/ml aprotinin, 10 ng/ml leupeptin, 10 mmglycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, separated by a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by silver staining (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. To obtain a 120-kDa radicicol-binding protein sufficient for enzymatic digestion and peptide sequence analysis, 2.4 g of protein of the rabbit reticulocyte lysate was incubated with 72 μg of BR-1 and 3.6 ml of streptavidin-agarose. The radicicol-binding protein was separated by SDS/7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) for 3 h. For efficient transfer of the 120-kDa protein, 0.05% SDS was added to the transfer buffer (15.6 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine). After the transfer, proteins were reversibly stained by 0.1% Ponceau S dye (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Protein-containing regions thus detected were cut out, washed thoroughly, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 100 mm acetic acid to prevent adsorption of the protease to the nitrocellulose during digestion. After removal of excess PVP-40, the protein on the nitrocellulose pieces was digested with 1 μg of lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) in 100 μl of protease buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 5% acetonitrile) at 37 °C overnight. After digestion, the whole reaction mixture was acidified by adding 4% (v/v) acetic acid and immediately loaded onto the HPLC column. The peptide mixture was separated with HPLC on a C4(250 × 4.6-mm) reverse phase column (Senshu Co.). The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min using a Shimadzu HPLC system. Elution was monitored at 215 nm, and peaks were manually collected. The N-terminal sequence was determined on an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer. A polyclonal anti-ACL antibody was raised against a synthesized C-terminal peptide corresponding to 1076His–Ile1095 of human ACL. The rabbit antiserum and preimmune serum were used for immunoblotting. Protein samples were loaded and electrophoresed on SDS/12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). After the membrane had been treated with the anti-ACL antiserum or a monoclonal anti-Hsp90 antibody raised against a peptide of human Hsp90 (residues 586–732), which reacts with the C terminus of human, mouse, and rat Hsp90 (BD Transduction Lab., CA), the immune complexes were detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rats starved for 48 h and fed a high sucrose diet (63% sucrose, 30% casein, 4% salt mixture, 2% cellulose powder, 1% vitamin mixture, and 0.1% choline chloride) for 3 days were killed by cervical dislocation, and their livers were excised and quickly homogenized in 4 volumes of buffer containing 0.25 msucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through four layers of gauze and recentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant thus obtained was divided into 1-ml portions, stored at −80 °C and thawed each time before use. ACL activity was measured by the malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of oxaloacetate by NADH (20Gribble A.D. Dolle R.E. Shaw A. McNair D. Novelli R. Novelli C.E. Slingsby B.P. Shah V.P. Tew D. Saxty B.A. Allen M. Groot P.H. Pearce N. Yates J. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3569-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.33 mm CoA, 0.14 mm NADH, 2 units of malate dehydrogenase, 5 mmcitrate, and 5 mm ATP. For kinetic analysis, a sample of the freshly thawed supernatant was preincubated with radicicol or biotinylated radicicol derivatives for 90 min at 4 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 μl of the enzyme preparation to the reaction mixture, and the rate of NADH oxidation was measured at 340 nm with a Spectra Max spectrometer (Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, CA). One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 μmol of NADH per min at 25 °C. Radicicol (Fig. 1, compound 1) is a macrocyclic antibiotic that contains an epoxide, a diene, and two phenolic hydroxy groups. To examine the role of these moieties in biological activity, we synthesized three novel radicicol analogs (compounds 2–4) and analyzed their activity to induce morphological reversion in v-src-transformed 3Y1 cells. Di(16-hydroxypalmitoyl) radicicol (compound 2) was as active as radicicol, whereas compound 3 lacking the diene structure showed about a half of the activity of radicicol. Reduction of the epoxide group of this analog (compound 4) fairly impaired the activity, suggesting that the epoxide is important for the activity of radicicol. On the basis of these observations, we introduced a biotin group into radicicol or these radicicol analogs. Radicicol was biotinylated at the C-17 (BR-1), C-9 (BR-5), or C-11 (BR-6) position. BR-2 and BR-3 were derivatives of compound 3 biotinylated at C-15 and C-11, respectively, whereas BR-4 was a derivative of compound 4 modified at C-11. Of these compounds, BR-1 and BR-6 were found to retain the activity of morphological reversion ofsrc-transformed 3Y1 (Fig. 1), although they were less active than radicicol. The effective concentrations of BR-1, BR-6, and radicicol for the reversion of src-transformed cells were determined to be 1.35 μm, 13.5 μm, and 0.27 μm, respectively. A HeLa cell extract was incubated with six biotinylated radicicol derivatives, and the bound proteins were precipitated with streptavidin beads and detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. As shown in Fig. 2, a 120-kDa protein was detected as a BR-1-binding protein, and a 90-kDa protein was detected as a BR-6-binding protein. On the other hand, no apparent proteins able to bind other biologically inactive derivatives (BR-2–BR-5) were detected. Radicicol as well as benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics, such as geldanamycin and herbimycin A, were shown to interact with Hsp90 (14Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D.

A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). To test whether the 90-kDa protein bound to BR-6 is Hsp90, we transferred the proteins eluted from the beads onto a membrane and analyzed them by Western blotting using an anti-Hsp90 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the 90-kDa protein bound to BR-6 was reactive with the anti-Hsp90 antibody, indicating the identity of the protein as Hsp90. To examine the specificity of this interaction, we tested whether radicicol can compete for the binding of BR-6 to Hsp90. Binding of BR-6 to Hsp90 was completely blocked by 10 μg/ml radicicol as well as 10 μg/ml herbimycin A, one of the known inhibitors of Hsp90 (Fig. 3 B). These results confirm the previous observation that radicicol binds Hsp90 in a manner similar to geldanamycin and herbimycin A (14Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D. Neckers L.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 15Sharma S.V. Agatsuma T. Nakano H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The rabbit reticulocyte lysate abundantly contained the 120-kDa BR-1-binding protein (p120). The amount of p120 bound to BR-1 increased as the amount of total protein of the lysate was increased (Fig. 4 A). We obtained a large amount of p120 from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by using the BR-1 affinity beads and then digested the preparation with lysyl endopeptidase and isolated a fragmented peptide by HPLC. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the peptide was LVSSLTSGLLTIGDRFGGALDAAAK, which matched 100% with those (residues 920–944) of the human and rat ACL (22Elshourbagy N.A. Near J.C. Kmetz P.J. Sathe G.M. Southan C. Strickler J.E. Gross M. Young J.F. Wells T.N. Groot P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1430-1435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm immunologically the identity of p120 as ACL, we raised a polyclonal antibody against a peptide corresponding to the amino acid residues 1076–1095 in the C terminus of human ACL. The immunoblot analysis showed that p120 was ACL. Binding of ACL to BR-1 was specific because an excess of radicicol blocked this association (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to the BR-6-Hsp90 interaction, however, herbimycin A did not compete for this binding (data not shown). To determine whether radicicol itself affects the enzyme activity of ACL, we assessed the effect of radicicol binding on the activity of ACL obtained from livers of rats starved for 48 h and fed with a high sucrose diet for 3 days. This diet resulted in about a 10-fold increase in the amount of the enzyme in the liver (23Takeda Y. Suzuki F. Inoue H. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 153-160Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We observed that BR-1 could also bind the 120-kDa protein in the rat liver extracts as well as in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a radicicol-sensitive manner. There was no detectable enzyme activity in the BR-1·ACL complex (Fig. 5). These results imply that radicicol inhibits the ACL activity through binding. Consistent with this, BR-1 and radicicol could directly inhibit the enzyme activity, when added to the enzyme preparation (Fig. 6). On the other hand, BR-6, which does not bind ACL but does bind Hsp90, had no inhibitory effect on the ACL activity. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/vversus 1/S (citrate−1) in the absence and presence of radicicol crossed at a fixed point on the 1/S axis, suggesting that radicicol did not affect the apparentKm but decreased the Vmaxvalue. Thus, we conclude that radicicol acts as a noncompetitive-type inhibitor of ACL. The Vmax values obtained with various concentrations of citrate and ATP were replotted for the determination of Ki values. TheKi values for citrate and ATP were 13 and 7 μm, respectively.Figure 6Kinetic analysis of inhibition of rat liver ACL by radicicol and its derivatives. A, Lineweaver-Burk plot of ACL.

The Vmax values for citrate and ATP in the presence of various concentrations of radicicol determined by the Lineweaver-Burk plots were replotted for the determination of theKi values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we showed that radicicol binds two different cellular proteins, Hsp90 and ACL. The Ki values for ACL were higher than the effective concentration of radicicol to induce morphological changes in v-src-transformed cells, which may rule out the possibility that effects of radicicol on the morphological changes of transformed cells are caused by the inhibition of ACL. Although BR-1, which does not bind Hsp90, induced the reversal of morphology of v-src-transformed cells (Fig. 1), it is unclear whether BR-1 is stable in vivo, because the ester bond at C-17 could be cleaved in the cells, leading to the generation of free radicicol. Therefore, it seems probable that the activity of BR-1 to induce morphological reversion of src-transformed cells is because of radicicol released from BR-1. However, it is still possible that ACL inhibition is involved in other biological activities of radicicol. We showed that BR-1 specifically binds ACL, whereas BR-6 does not. In contrast, BR-6 binds Hsp90, but BR-1 does not. These observations imply that a different part in radicicol is required for each specific binding and that unmodified radicicol can bind both the proteins. It is likely that the introduction of the bulky biotin probe prevents these biotinylated compounds from access to one of these target proteins. In fact, recent crystal structure analysis demonstrated that radicicol acted as a nucleotide mimic and that the phenolic hydroxy group at C-17 of radicicol interacted with the water molecule tightly bound to Asp-79, Gly-83, and Thr-171 in the N-terminal ATP/ADP binding domain of Hsp90 (24Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). This water molecule forms a hydrogen bond to the adenine base of ATP/ADP in the absence of radicicol. Thus, the modification at C-17 of radicicol should impair the binding of radicicol to Hsp90. On the other hand, the carbonyl group at C-11 may be important for radicicol binding to ACL. Kinetic analysis suggests that radicicol does not compete with ATP for ACL binding, supporting the idea that radicicol binds and inhibits ACL in a different way. No competition of herbimycin A for the binding of BR-1 to ACL also supports this idea. It is therefore possible to design a selective inhibitor of ACL by modifying radicicol at C-17. In the cytosolic compartment of mammalian cells, ACL generates acetyl-CoA by the ATP-driven conversion of citrate and CoA into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. Because this is the first step for de novo synthesis of sterol and fatty acid, ACL is a potential target for hypolipidaemic intervention (25Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The high level expression of fatty acid synthase is widely observed in carcinoma of the colon, prostate, ovary, breast, and endometrium (26Kuhajda F.P. Jenner K. Wood F.D. Hennigar R.A. Jacobs L.B.

These observations suggest that ACL inhibitors bear potential as an anticancer agent by reducing the fatty acid synthesis. Thus, radicicol will be a novel lead compound for not only anti-Hsp90 drugs but also selective ACL inhibitors, which may be important for blocking both lipogenesis and oncogenesis. We thank Dr. Y. Sugimura and Dr. K. Tanzawa of Sankyo Co. Ltd., for supplying radicicol and Dr. T. Hidaka of the University of Tokyo for helping us to prepare rat liver ATP citrate lyase."

Initiation alone yields abortive transcripts, whereas initiation followed by elongation yields full-length mRNA. A body of work identifying physical differences between initiating and elongating transcription complexes supports this two-stage model. For example, the carboxyl-terminal domain of cellular RNA polymerase II is unphosphorylated during initiation but highly phosphorylated during elongation (8Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Furuichi Y. Nakashima K. LaFiandra A.J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6507-6514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Virology. 1982; 118: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The conserved sequence at the 3′ terminus of reovirus mRNAs is 5′-UCAUC (25Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Fields B.N. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1557-1596Google Scholar). For comparison, bacteriophage T7 abortive transcripts are two to seven nucleotides long (26Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Reovirus is a non-enveloped icosahedrally symmetric virus with two concentric protein capsids surrounding and protecting its segmented, double-stranded RNA genome (for reviews, see Refs. 25Nibert M.L.

Immunol. 1998; 233/I: 1-30Google Scholar). In addition to 2 protein capsids and 10 segments of genomic double-stranded RNA, intact virions are reported to contain 2000 to 3000 single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (oligos)1 of varying length and sequence (28Bellamy A.R. Hole L.V. Virology. 1970; 40: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Nichols J.L. Bellamy A.R. Joklik W.K.

A study of immature progeny virions isolated from reovirus-infected cells indicated that synthesis of these particle-associated RNA oligos occurs at a late step in virion morphogenesis (32Zweerink H.J. Morgan E.M. Skyler J.S. Virology. 1976; 73: 442-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the RNA oligos, which comprise both abortive transcripts and poly(A), are products of the reovirus polymerase after outer capsid assembly (29Nichols J.L. Bellamy A.R. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1972; 49: 562-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Bellamy A.R. Hole L.V. Baguley B.C.

Although there is evidence that RNA oligos are not required for infection (35Carter C. Stoltzfus C.M. Banerjee A.K. Shatkin A.J. J. Virol. 1974; 13: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their significance has not been investigated further. Reovirus virions can be proteolytically digested in vitro to remove the outer capsid (36Joklik W.K. Virology. 1972; 49: 700-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), yielding transcriptionally active core particles (19Shatkin A.J. Sipe J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Borsa J. Sargent M.D. Lievaart P.A. Copps T.P. Virology. 1981; 111: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The particle-associated RNA oligos are released upon conversion to cores (28Bellamy A.R. Hole L.V. Virology. 1970; 40: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Carter C. Stoltzfus C.M. Banerjee A.K. Shatkin A.J. J. Virol. 1974; 13: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Joklik W.K. Virology. 1972; 49: 700-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 38Shatkin A.J.

Only core particles synthesize full-length mRNA in vitro (16Banerjee A.K. Shatkin A.J. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Shatkin A.J. Sipe J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Drayna D. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 110-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, both virions and cores are reported to synthesize abortive transcripts (23Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Nakashima K. LaFiandra A.J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6507-6514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Virology. 1982; 118: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). From these observations, it was hypothesized that the reovirus outer capsid blocks elongation but not initiation by the particle-associated polymerase (24Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Virology. 1982; 118: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The recent development of the in vitro reovirus recoated core system allows more direct testing of polymerase regulation. Recoated cores (r-cores) are formed by the addition of recombinant major outer capsid proteins μ1 and ς3 to cores (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R-cores contain levels of μ1 and ς3 that approximate those in virions (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or 600 copies of each protein per particle (42Coombs K.M. Virology. 1998; 243: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both μ1 and ς3 proteins are required to recoat cores; r-cores containing only μ1 or only ς3 cannot be generated (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R-cores containing minor outer capsid protein ς1 (r-cores+ς1) in addition to μ1 and ς3 can also be produced. 2K. Chandran, X. Zhang, N. H. Olson, S. B. Walker, J. D. Chappell, T. S. Dermody, T. S. Baker, and M. L. Nibert, submitted for publication.2K. Chandran, X. Zhang, N. H. Olson, S. B. Walker, J. D. Chappell, T. S. Dermody, T. S. Baker, and M. L. Nibert, submitted for publication. Both r-cores (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and r-cores+ς12 resemble native virions with regard to protein composition, particle morphology, biophysical properties, and route of entry into cells. In this study, we used r-cores and r-cores+ς1 to address the role of outer capsid proteins in transcriptional regulation. Our findings provide evidence that the particle-associated reovirus RNA polymerase is regulated separately at the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. Spinner-adapted murine L cells were grown in suspension in Joklik's modified minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, Calif.) containing fetal bovine serum (2%), neonatal bovine serum (2%) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, Utah), and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Irvine Scientific). Both type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D) reovirus strains were used in this study. Plaque assays to determine the infectivities of reovirus preparations were performed as described (43Furlong D.B. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 246-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trichoplusia ni Tn High Five insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were grown in TC-100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%). Purified T1L and T3D virions were obtained as described (44Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virion buffer contains 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Cores were generated from virions by in vitroprotease digestion and purified as described (44Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Particle concentrations were estimated by A260 (39Smith R.E. Zweerink H.J. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1969; 39: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 42Coombs K.M. Virology. 1998; 243: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two different recombinant baculoviruses, each directing expression of both μ1 and ς3 proteins, were used in this study. One baculovirus contained genes encoding wild-type T1L μ1 and T1L ς3 proteins (L/L)2. The second baculovirus contained genes encoding wild-type T3D μ1 and T1L ς3 proteins (D/L). The vector used to generate D/L virus was constructed by replacing the T1L M2 gene (which encodes μ1) in the L/LpFastbac DUAL vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the T3D M2 gene. The T3D M2-pcDNA I construct (a generous gift of Leslie Schiff) was digested by AseI at a site in the vector just 3′ to the M2 insert. The AseI overhangs were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I as per manufacturer's instructions, and the construct was next digested withNcoI. NcoI cleaved the T3D and T1L M2 genes 195 base pairs into the insert. The 48 amino acids encoded by M2 upstream of the NcoI site are identical between T1L and T3D μ1 proteins. The resulting 2113-base pair-long T3D M2 fragment was ligated into the L/L pFastbacDUAL vector from which the T1L gene had been removed by digestion with HindIII, followed by Klenow treatment and NcoI digestion. Automated DNA sequencing at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center DNA Facility (Madison, WI) verified the validity of all constructs. Klenow polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and all restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The D/L construct was used to generate recombinant baculovirus containing the dual expression cassette as per the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.). High titer baculovirus stocks were generated and utilized to produce large amounts of μ1 and ς3 proteins, and cytoplasmic extracts of baculovirus-infected cells were prepared by lysis with Triton X-100 as described (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare r-cores, insect cell cytoplasmic extracts containing both μ1 and ς3 (L/L or D/L) were incubated with purified T1L or T3D cores at a ratio of 380 μg μ1 and 200 μg ς3 per 2.5 × 1012 cores. These amounts of μ1 and ς3 represent a 2-fold excess of protein relative to the amounts needed to fully recoat the number of cores present. Incubation was either for 2 h at 37 °C or for 4 h at room temperature. R-cores+ς1 were generated as described2. R-cores were purified on two sequential CsCl density gradients as described (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare activated r-cores, r-cores were proteolytically digested in the manner described for cores but were not purified (45Dryden K.A. Farsetta D.L. Wang G.-J. Keegan J.M. Fields B.N. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. Virology. 1998; 225: 33-46Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Experiments described under “Results” indicated that r-cores that had been recoated at 37 °C exhibited one-third to one-half of the mRNA synthesis levels of the parent cores after proteolytic activation (data not shown). Time course experiments demonstrated that the transcriptional enzymes in these particles do not lose activity with reaction time, due either to inefficient reinitiation of transcription or to reduction in elongation rates (data not shown). Rather, these activated r-cores exhibit consistent, inherently lower mRNA production than cores. Because the level of mRNA synthesis after activation is the only enzymatic property that differs between r-cores recoated at room temperature and those recoated at 37 °C (see “Results”), all mRNA data was generated with room temperature r-cores, whereas other data was generated with room temperature and/or 37 °C r-cores. Partially recoated particles were generated similarly to r-cores, but higher ratios of particles to insect-cell cytoplasmic extract were used. Cores were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with a volume of insect cell lysate containing one-tenth to one-half the amount of μ1 and ς3 outer capsid proteins utilized to generate r-cores. Particles were purified on two sequential CsCl density gradients, and the final gradient was fractionated to obtain a number of particle samples with varying levels of bound μ1 and ς3. Partially recoated particle fractions were dialyzed into virion buffer and proteolytically activated as described for r-cores. Particle concentrations were estimated as for r-cores (see below). Levels of particle-bound μ1 and ς3 were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry, calculated from the λ to (μ1 + μ1C) protein band ratio, and compared with native virions to determine the percentage of outer capsid substitution. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels, and particle concentrations were determined by densitometry as described (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription reactions (10 or 15 μl total volume containing 2 × 1010 or 3 × 1010 particles, respectively) were performed, and transcription levels were quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, which precipitates RNA products of over approximately 50 nucleotides in length, followed by scintillation counting, as described (46Luongo C.L. Dryden K.A. Farsetta D.L. Margraf R.L. Severson T.F. Olson N.H. Fields B.N. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8035-8040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA oligo reactions were carried out similarly to transcription reactions, with the following exceptions: the divalent cation in the reaction was either 4 mm MnCl2 or 6 mm MgCl2, and the radiolabel used was 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) (as opposed to other labeled ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs)) (23Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Nakashima K. LaFiandra A.J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6507-6514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Virology. 1982; 118: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following incubation at temperature for time, reactions were boiled for 2 min prior to treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 60 to 90 min. Abortive transcript levels were quantitated from high percentage acrylamide RNA-sequencing gels (below) by determining the volume of the abortive transcript bands (minus the volume of a comparable area of a lane in which a no-particle control was run) visualized by phosphorimaging. Abortive transcripts were resolved on 20% acrylamide RNA-sequencing gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 7m urea, 1× TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) with a 5% stacker. Oligo gels were cast to be 0.75 mm thick, 16 cm wide, and 20 cm long. Gels were pre-run at 600 V, 30 W, and 30 mA for at least 30 min before sample loading, and samples were run at 500 V, 30 W, and 30 mA until the xylene cyanol loading dye had migrated nearly two-thirds down the gel (approximately 4 h) (23Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Nakashima K. LaFiandra A.J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6507-6514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamakawa M. Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J.

Viral mRNAs were resolved on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde as described (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radiolabeled single-stranded RNA size markers were generated using the RiboMark labeling system, as per manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Samples for both oligo and mRNA gels were disrupted by boiling for 2 min after the addition of an equal volume of 2× loading buffer containing 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 6 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose, and bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes. Oligo reactions were carried out as above except that the reaction volume was 20 μl, and reactions contained 7 × 1010 particles, 2 μCi [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products), and 0.25 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine. After incubation at 40 °C for 7 h, free label was removed by twice pelleting the particles by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, removing the supernatant, and resuspending the particles in 20 μl of virion buffer. Reaction then were boiled for 2 min. The samples were divided into two 10-μl aliquots and prepared for thin-layer chromatography by either nuclease P1 digestion alone or both nuclease P1 digestion and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase treatment. Either 1 μg of nuclease P1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) or nuclease P1 with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and one-tenth volume 10× NEB Buffer 3 (New England Biolabs) were added to each aliquot, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. All reactions were phenol/chloroform-extracted before spotting onto 20 × 20-cm polyethyleneimine-cellulose F TLC plastic sheets (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). TLC plates were developed in 1.2 mLiCl until the solvent front reached the top of the plate (approximately 90 min) (49Chen D. Luongo C.L. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T. Virology. 1999; 265: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The particle to plaque-forming unit ratio of particle preparations was determined by plaque assay as described (43Furlong D.B. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 246-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gels were scaled uniformly and adjusted for optimal brightness and contrast in Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA.). Abortive transcript bands on high percentage acrylamide RNA-sequencing gels were quantitated using Image Quant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif.). All figures were produced in Illustrator 7.0 (Adobe). When provided with all four rNTPs and a divalent cation, cores produce large amounts of full-length mRNA, but virions do not (16Banerjee A.K. Shatkin A.J. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Shatkin A.J. Sipe J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Drayna D. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 110-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because virions and r-cores have similar biochemical, structural, and infectious properties (41Chandran K. Walker S.B. Chen Y. Contreras C.M. Schiff L.A. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), r-cores were expected to be as transcriptionally inactive as virions. It was conceivable, however, that in vitro recoating might not completely block the capacity of r-cores to synthesize viral mRNA. R-cores generated from either T1L or T3D cores, either T1L μ1 or T3D μ1, and T1L ς3 were analyzed for transcriptional activity (experiments described in subsequent sections were performed with r-cores generated from T1L cores, T1L μ1, and T1L ς3, and results were confirmed with r-cores of different composition where noted). R-cores were found to be as inactive at mRNA synthesis as virions, as measured by incorporation of radiolabeled rNTPs into acid-precipitable material (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the binding of stoichiometric (or virion-like) levels of μ1 and ς3 outer capsid proteins to cores in our in vitro system was sufficient to reduce viral mRNA synthesis to virion (or background) levels. To address the concern that particle-associated transcriptional enzymes might suffer damage during the recoating process, we determined whether r-cores converted to cores by protease digestion (activated r-cores) synthesize full-length mRNA at high levels, as do parent cores. mRNA synthesis by parent virions and cores, r-cores, and activated r-cores (Fig. 1 A) was compared. After proteolytic activation, r-cores (recoated at room temperature; see “Experimental Procedures”) were as highly active at full-length mRNA production as the parent cores (Fig. 1 B). This was true of different r-core preparations containing either T1L or T3D μ1 (data not shown). To ascertain whether activated r-cores produced the same transcripts as cores, radiolabeled mRNA synthesized in vitro by cores and activated r-cores was analyzed on agarose/formaldehyde gels. Core and activated r-core mRNAs comigrated in this and other gel systems (Fig. 1 C and data not shown), providing evidence that the two particle types produced the same transcripts. These results indicate that the recoating process does not damage reovirus transcriptional enzymes. The block to viral mRNA synthesis apparent in r-cores before proteolytic activation (Fig. 1 B) thus appears to reflect a specific form of outer capsid-mediated transcriptional regulation. Like virions, r-cores containing a full complement of major outer capsid proteins μ1 and ς3 did not synthesize mRNA (Fig. 1 B). To understand better how μ1 and ς3 may block full-length transcript production, we generated partially recoated particles, which contain less μ1 and ς3 than do virions or r-cores (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several density gradient fractions of partially recoated particles were isolated that varied in the average levels of bound μ1 and ς3. Electron microscopy of partially recoated particles revealed core-like particles containing patches of outer capsid. 3K. Chandran, Y. Chen, and M. L. Nibert, unpublished obse"

Gas1p, which is another plasma membrane component, was used as a control for the experiments with Pma1p. Contrary to Gas1p, which is not affected by the deletion of the V-ATPase complex in the V-ATPase null mutants, the amount of Pma1p in the plasma membrane is markedly reduced, and there is a large accumulation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Kex2p and Gef1p, which are considered to reside in the post-Golgi vesicles, were suggested as required for the V-ATPase function; hence, their null mutant phenotype should have been similar to the V-ATPase null mutants. We show that, in addition to the known differences between those yeast phenotypes, deletions of KEX2 or GEF1 in yeast do not affect the distribution of Pma1p as the V-ATPase null mutant does.

Harvey W.R. Phys. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two mechanistically distinct ATP-dependent proton pumps that play a pivotal role in these processes. One is Pma1p, which functions in the plasma membrane, and the second is the V-ATPase,1 which functions in the vacuolar system (2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 3Catty P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Pma1p is an essential enzyme that provides the protonmotive force for the yeast plasma membrane and plays a major role in the pH homeostasis of the cell (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The enzyme is capable of generating very high membrane potentials, and in the presence of permeant anions, pH gradients of more than 3 units are observed (5Slayman C.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 1-20PubMed Google Scholar). To maintain its proper activity as well as to prevent its deleterious activity in different aspects of the secretory pathway, its transport to the cell surface must be strictly controlled. The amount of Pma1p in the plasma membrane is also under strict control, and usually the enzyme is present at relatively constant amounts of 25–50% of the membrane proteins (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because of its importance for the viability of the cell, Pma1p was subjected to extensive studies aimed at understanding its mechanism of action as well as its potential as a drug target for antifungal agents (6Seto-Young D.

For these reasons, the genePMA1 was subjected to mutagenesis and numerous mutants that influenced its catalytic activity and/or targeting to the plasma membrane have been generated (7Petrov V.V.

Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 155-160PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these mutants exhibited reduced amounts of Pma1p in the plasma membrane and resulted in growth sensitivity at low pH (11Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Monk B.C. Seto-Young D. Na S. Anand S. Haber J.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 607: 183-192Google Scholar, 12McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).While Pma1p is vital, and null mutations in this protein are lethal, null mutations even in one of the numerous V-ATPase subunits, while lethal in other eukaryotes, are conditionally lethal in yeast. Their vitality can be sustained when yeast mutants are grown at low pH (13Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 14Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It was proposed that yeast V-ATPase null mutants could grow at low pH because they are able to energize their vacuolar system by fluid phase endocytosis, which provides an acidic medium for the lumen. Indeed, inactivation of the genes involved in endocytosis on the background of a V-ATPase null mutation caused lethality (16Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Due to its location in the organelles of the secretory pathway, the V-ATPase plays a role in protein targeting (17Forgac M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the V-ATPase with the drug bafilomycin A1, as well as V-ATPase null mutations, resulted in the accumulation and missorting of precursor forms of various vacuolar proteins (18Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 19Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10564-10572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that, under those conditions, precursor forms of vacuolar hydrolases were accumulated within the Golgi complex and/or post-Golgi compartments (22Yaver D.S. Nelson H. Nelson N. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10564-10572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that proteins having luminally oriented targeting signals were directly dependent on compartment acidification for efficient vacuolar delivery (23Morano K.A Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2813-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Studies with different vacuolar proteins revealed involvement of at least two distinct targeting pathways to the vacuole (24Wendland B. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). One goes through the endosomes, and the other delivers the proteins directly to the vacuole from the post-Golgi vesicles. Similarly, multiple delivery pathways of plasma membrane proteins may exist (25de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Goffeau A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies of Pma1p sorting revealed involvement of several proteins needed specifically for its transport to the plasma membrane (9Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Luo W.J. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this work, we report on such a differential effect of V-ATPase null mutations on the sorting of Pma1p to the plasma membrane. We show that while the targeting of Pma1p is highly affected by the V-ATPase null mutations, these mutations have very little effect on the targeting of Gas1p, Sec61p, or Sed5p into their respective compartments.Until now, every V-ATPase mutant studied that abolished the activity of the enzyme shared more then one feature with the other V-ATPase mutants' phenotypes. Since medium pH growth requirements are common to a variety of different mutations, in order to characterize a new V-ATPase-defective mutant, we have to demonstrate several features that coexist with and are similar to a known subunit of the V-ATPase-deleted mutant. The sorting profile of Pma1p in the V-ATPase mutants can be added to this assortment of features.Kex2p and Gef1p, two membrane proteins residing in the post-Golgi vesicles, were indicated as influencing V-ATPase activity. Their null mutants were created in two different yeast strains, and both had intact V-ATPase activity and regular quinacrine accumulation in the vacuole as well as wild-type profile of Pma1p distribution. The conclusions from these observations are that neither Kex2p nor Gef1p has a general effect upon the V-ATPase activity; nor do they affect the sorting path of Pma1p in the secretory pathway in the way that the V-ATPase null mutant does.DISCUSSIONPma1p is an essential enzyme that provides the protonmotive force for the yeast plasma membrane and plays a major role in the pH homeostasis of the cell. The amount of Pma1p in the plasma membrane is also under strict control, and the enzyme is present usually in a relatively constant amount (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase complements the function of Pma1p in organelles and membranes of the vacuolar system (52Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to its function as the main energizing enzyme in the vacuolar system, the V-ATPase was found to be involved in the sorting processes of proteins to the vacuolar compartment in yeast (53Nelson N. Klionsky D.J. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has long been known that acidification of a lysosomal compartment is required for proper sorting of soluble lysosomal proteases in mammalian cells, utilizing the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway (54Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). The pre-Golgi and cis-Golgi membranes were also shown to contain a V-ATPase activity. There it regulates retrograde membrane traffic at the ER-Golgi pathway (56Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A compartment acidification requirement was demonstrated in the targeting of GPP130 (Golgiphosphoprotein of 130 kDa) to the early Golgi (57Linstedt A.D. Mehta A. Suhan J. Reggio H. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1073-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It would be expected that the other secretory sites would also be sensitive to the pH in their respective compartments.In this study, we examined the influence of V-ATPase null mutations in yeast on the processes of targeting to the plasma membrane by following their effect on the Pma1p distribution. Numerous studies investigated the influence of deletion or overexpression of proteins, known to reside in the secretory pathway, on Pma1p sorting and targeting to the plasma membrane in yeast. Among them, Ast1p, Ast2p, Vps8p, and Vps36p were investigated and found to influence the Pma1p distribution (9Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 58Luo W.J. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By comparison with the Gas1p, another plasma membrane resident, several proteins with a differential effect on Pma1p were discovered. Among them is Lst1p, which was suggested to take part in the transport of Pma1p from ER to the Golgi compartment (27Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Another was identified as Eps1p (ER-retained PMA1suppressor), which functions in ER quality control (45Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The mutant of Eps1p suppresses the D378N phenotype by allowing both the mutant and wild-type Pma1p molecules to travel to the plasma membrane. Its null mutant does not affect the sorting of native Pma1p at all, whereas it causes a marked accumulation of the 105-kDa ER form of Gas1p in the ER.We found that V-ATPase null mutants have a specific effect on Pma1p as well. To determine its distribution on the sucrose gradient, we used Sec61p as a marker of the ER, Sed5p as a marker for the Golgi compartment, and Gas1p as the other plasma membrane marker. There was no change in the distribution of Sec61p and Sed5p in the mutant in comparison with the wild-type strain; nor was the amount of Gas1p in the plasma membrane reduced, although its 105-kDa intermediate was elevated in the ER in comparison with the wild-type strain. However, Pma1p amounts in the plasma membrane in the ATPase-depleted mutants were markedly reduced, and a large amount of the protein was accumulated in the ER in a nonactive form.The fact that, in V-ATPase null mutants, the distribution of Gas1p differs from Pma1p suggests that lack of acidification of the various compartments differentially changes the protein composition of their membranes but not the characteristics of the membranes in general. The decline in Pma1p in plasma membrane may be a unique feature of this protein, whereas the slowdown of movement from ER to Golgi, as demonstrated by Gas1p in the mutant yeast, might be a general feature of the mutant.The question remains as to the site of the crucial secretory pathway compartment, whose acidification by V-ATPase is vital. The fact that the site of Pma1p accumulation in the mutant is in the ER suggests that the passage from ER to Golgi in the V-ATPase mutants is impaired. This hypothesis is supported by several previous results. It was shown in mammalian cells that retrograde transport from the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi complex is affected by the V-ATPase-specific inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (56Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In yeast, the deletion of the LST1 gene that encodes for a peripheral ER membrane protein results in a profile of Pma1p distribution on sucrose gradient similar to the one of V-ATPase null mutants (27Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Lst1p takes part in efficient packaging of Pma1p into vesicles derived from the ER. Moreover, it was shown that the plasma membrane H+-ATPase undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes (59Blanpain J.P. Ronjat M. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Goffeau A. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3735-3740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If we assume that the V-ATPase functions incis-Golgi, then the impaired sorting of Pma1p in the V-ATPase null mutant could be explained by damage to the retrograde transport of factors such as Lst1p or conformational changes in Pma1p, imposed by the improper pH conditions.The defect that V-ATPase null mutants are mostly checked for is their inability to grow on a buffered pH 7.5 medium. However, these mutants are also defective in growth on a low pH medium (13Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The inability to grow on very acidic medium was demonstrated for a wide range of Pma1p mutants as well and was explained by a low activity of the mutant, stemming from either the mutation or competition of the mutant on the targeting to the membrane with the intact protein (12McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 60Wang G. Tamas M.J. Hall M.J. Pascual-Ahuir A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25438-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since we find that in V-ATPase null mutants the amount of Pma1p in the plasma membrane is markedly reduced, it is tempting to suggest that the reduced growth rate at low pH is caused by reduced levels of Pma1p in the plasma membrane of those mutants.In this study, we show that the altered distribution of Pma1p in V-ATPase null mutant can serve as another characteristic feature of it. Kex2p and Gef1p were both suggested to be involved in the proper function of the acidification by the V-ATPase (48Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1534-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 49Gaxiola R.A. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the case of the ΔKEX2 null mutant, there has been a discrepancy in the original paper, where the ATPase and proton pumping activities in isolated vacuoles of this mutant were undamaged, whereas the vacuoles failed to accumulate quinacrine. To exclude the possibility that in our strain (W303), uniquely, the deletion of Kex2p did not affect the quinacrine accumulation in the vacuoles, we disrupted this gene in two additional strains and in them observed as well that the ΔKEX2 mutant was fully active in quinacrine accumulation into their vacuoles. In addition, when we checked the distribution of the Pma1p in theΔKEX2 and ΔGEF1mutants, it was similar to the wild type and not to the V-ATPase mutant. By metal supplementation in the growth medium, we showed that the addition of 5 μm Cu2+ rescued theΔKEX2 and ΔGEF1 mutants and enabled their growth on pH 7.5 medium, whereas it did not have any effect upon the V-ATPase mutant. Therefore, a direct interaction between Kex2p or Gef1p and V-ATPase can be excluded. However, their activity may be involved in some cellular functions, such as anion transport or metal ion homeostasis, in specific organelles of the secretory pathway that also affect the growth at high pH levels in the medium. Proton pumps play a major role in providing energy for several secondary uptake processes as well as maintaining the pH homeostasis required for the living cell and subcellular compartments (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Phys. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two mechanistically distinct ATP-dependent proton pumps that play a pivotal role in these processes. One is Pma1p, which functions in the plasma membrane, and the second is the V-ATPase,1 which functions in the vacuolar system (2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 3Catty P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Pma1p is an essential enzyme that provides the protonmotive force for the yeast plasma membrane and plays a major role in the pH homeostasis of the cell (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The enzyme is capable of generating very high membrane potentials, and in the presence of permeant anions, pH gradients of more than 3 units are observed (5Slayman C.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 1-20PubMed Google Scholar). To maintain its proper activity as well as to prevent its deleterious activity in different aspects of the secretory pathway, its transport to the cell surface must be strictly controlled. The amount of Pma1p in the plasma membrane is also under strict control, and usually the enzyme is present at relatively constant amounts of 25–50% of the membrane proteins (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because of its importance for the viability of the cell, Pma1p was subjected to extensive studies aimed at understanding its mechanism of action as well as its potential as a drug target for antifungal agents (6Seto-Young D. Monk B. Mason A.B. Perlin D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the genePMA1 was subjected to mutagenesis and numerous mutants that influenced its catalytic activity and/or targeting to the plasma membrane have been generated (7Petrov V.V.

Among them is Lst1p, which was suggested to take part in the transport of Pma1p from ER to the Golgi compartment (27Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Another was identified as Eps1p (ER-retained PMA1suppressor), which functions in ER quality control (45Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The mutant of Eps1p suppresses the D378N phenotype by allowing both the mutant and wild-type Pma1p molecules to travel to the plasma membrane. Its null mutant does not affect the sorting of native Pma1p at all, whereas it causes a marked accumulation of the 105-kDa ER form of Gas1p in the ER.We found that V-ATPase null mutants have a specific effect on Pma1p as well. To determine its distribution on the sucrose gradient, we used Sec61p as a marker of the ER, Sed5p as a marker for the Golgi compartment, and Gas1p as the other plasma membrane marker. There was no change in the distribution of Sec61p and Sed5p in the mutant in comparison with the wild-type strain; nor was the amount of Gas1p in the plasma membrane reduced, although its 105-kDa intermediate was elevated in the ER in comparison with the wild-type strain. However, Pma1p amounts in the plasma membrane in the ATPase-depleted mutants were markedly reduced, and a large amount of the protein was accumulated in the ER in a nonactive form.The fact that, in V-ATPase null mutants, the distribution of Gas1p differs from Pma1p suggests that lack of acidification of the various compartments differentially changes the protein composition of their membranes but not the characteristics of the membranes in general. The decline in Pma1p in plasma membrane may be a unique feature of this protein, whereas the slowdown of movement from ER to Golgi, as demonstrated by Gas1p in the mutant yeast, might be a general feature of the mutant.The question remains as to the site of the crucial secretory pathway compartment, whose acidification by V-ATPase is vital. The fact that the site of Pma1p accumulation in the mutant is in the ER suggests that the passage from ER to Golgi in the V-ATPase mutants is impaired. This hypothesis is supported by several previous results. It was shown in mammalian cells that retrograde transport from the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi complex is affected by the V-ATPase-specific inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (56Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In yeast, the deletion of the LST1 gene that encodes for a peripheral ER membrane protein results in a profile of Pma1p distribution on sucrose gradient similar to the one of V-ATPase null mutants (27Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Lst1p takes part in efficient packaging of Pma1p into vesicles derived from the ER. Moreover, it was shown that the plasma membrane H+-ATPase undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes (59Blanpain J.P. Ronjat M. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Goffeau A. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3735-3740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If we assume that the V-ATPase functions incis-Golgi, then the impaired sorting of Pma1p in the V-ATPase null mutant could be explained by damage to the retrograde transport of factors such as Lst1p or conformational changes in Pma1p, imposed by the improper pH conditions.The defect that V-ATPase null mutants are mostly checked for is their inability to grow on a buffered pH 7.5 medium. However, these mutants are also defective in growth on a low pH medium (13Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The inability to grow on very acidic medium was demonstrated for a wide range of Pma1p mutants as well and was explained by a low activity of the mutant, stemming from either the mutation or competition of the mutant on the targeting to the membrane with the intact protein (12McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 60Wang G. Tamas M.J. Hall M.J. Pascual-Ahuir A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25438-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since we find that in V-ATPase null mutants the amount of Pma1p in the plasma membrane is markedly reduced, it is tempting to suggest that the reduced growth rate at low pH is caused by reduced levels of Pma1p in the plasma membrane of those mutants.In this study, we show that the altered distribution of Pma1p in V-ATPase null mutant can serve as another characteristic feature of it. Kex2p and Gef1p were both suggested to be involved in the proper function of the acidification by the V-ATPase (48Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1534-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 49Gaxiola R.A. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the case of the ΔKEX2 null mutant, there has been a discrepancy in the original paper, where the ATPase and proton pumping activities in isolated vacuoles of this mutant were undamaged, whereas the vacuoles failed to accumulate quinacrine. To exclude the possibility that in our strain (W303), uniquely, the deletion of Kex2p did not affect the quinacrine accumulation in the vacuoles, we disrupted this gene in two additional strains and in them observed as well that the ΔKEX2 mutant was fully active in quinacrine accumulation into their vacuoles. In addition, when we checked the distribution of the Pma1p in theΔKEX2 and ΔGEF1mutants, it was similar to the wild type and not to the V-ATPase mutant. By metal supplementation in the growth medium, we showed that the addition of 5 μm Cu2+ rescued theΔKEX2 and ΔGEF1 mutants and enabled their growth on pH 7.5 medium, whereas it did not have any effect upon the V-ATPase mutant. Therefore, a direct interaction between Kex2p or Gef1p and V-ATPase can be excluded. However, their activity may be involved in some cellular functions, such as anion transport or metal ion homeostasis, in specific organelles of the secretory pathway that also affect the growth at high pH levels in the medium. Pma1p is an essential enzyme that provides the protonmotive force for the yeast plasma membrane and plays a major role in the pH homeostasis of the cell. The amount of Pma1p in the plasma membrane is also under strict control, and the enzyme is present usually in a relatively constant amount (4Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase complements the function of Pma1p in organelles and membranes of the vacuolar system (52Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to its function as the main energizing enzyme in the vacuolar system, the V-ATPase was found to be involved in the sorting processes of proteins to the vacuolar compartment in yeast (53Nelson N. Klionsky D.J. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has long been known that acidification of a lysosomal compartment is required for proper sorting of soluble lysosomal proteases in mammalian cells, utilizing the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway (54Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). The pre-Golgi and cis-Golgi membranes were also shown to contain a V-ATPase activity. There it regulates retrograde membrane traffic at the ER-Golgi pathway (56Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A compartment acidification requirement was demonstrated in the targeting of GPP130 (Golgiphosphoprotein of 130 kDa) to the early Golgi (57Linstedt A.D. Mehta A. Suhan J. Reggio H. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1073-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It would be expected that the other secretory sites would also be sensitive to the pH in their respective compartments. In this study, we examined the influence of V-ATPase null mutations in yeast on the processes of targeting to the plasma membrane by following their effect on the Pma1p distribution. Numerous studies investigated the influence of deletion or overexpression of proteins, known to reside in the secretory pathway, on Pma1p sorting and targeting to the plasma membrane in yeast. Among them, Ast1p, Ast2p, Vps8p, and Vps36p were investigated and found to influence the Pma1p distribution (9Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 58Luo W.J. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

To determine if the inability of Raf to transform RIE-1 cells is due to a failure to deregulate cell cycle progression, we evaluated the consequences of sustained Ras and Raf activation on steady state levels of cyclin D1, p21CIP/WAF, and p27KIP1. Both Ras- and Raf-transformed NIH 3T3 cells showed up-regulated expression of cyclin D1, p21, and p27 protein, increased retinoblastoma (Rb) hyperphosphorylation, and increased activation of E2F-mediated transcription. Similarly, Ras-transformed RIE-1 cells also showed up-regulation of cyclin D1, p21, and hyperphosphorylated Rb. In contrast, Ras-mediated down-regulation of p27 was seen in RIE-1 cells. Conversely, stable expression of activated Raf alone caused only a partial up-regulation of p21 and Rb hyperphosphorylation but no activation of E2F-responsive transcription or down-regulation of p27 in RIE-1 cells. Moreover, we found that the AP-1 site was dispensable for Ras-mediated stimulation of the cyclin-D1 promoter in NIH 3T3 cells but was essential for Ras-mediated stimulation in RIE-1 cells. Thus, up-regulation of p21, rather than the down-regulation seen in previous transient expression studies, is seen with sustained Ras activation. Additionally, p27 may serve a positive (NIH 3T3) or negative (RIE-1) regulatory role in Ras transformation that is cell type-dependent. The involvement of Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in mediating Ras changes in cyclin D1, p21, and p27 was also very distinct in NIH 3T3 and RIE-1 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of Raf-independent pathways in mediating oncogenic Ras deregulation of cell cycle progression in epithelial cells.

Therefore, the signaling pathways that mediate oncogenic Ras growth transformation have been studied intensively. Although it is clear that Ras activation of the Raf/MEK1/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is important for Ras transformation, it has also become clear that Ras transformation also requires the activation of multiple Raf-independent effector pathways (3Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pathways important for Ras transformation also exhibit cell type differences. In addition to Raf, Ras also associates with a spectrum of other downstream effector targets. Among these, the phosphoinositide 3-phosphate lipid kinases (PI3Ks) represent the second best characterized effectors of Ras (4Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Activated PI3K, a lipid kinase, facilitates the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate levels are elevated in Ras-transformed cells and promote the activation of the Akt/protein kinase B serine/threonine kinase (5Fleischman L.F. Chahwala S.B. Cantley L. Science. 1986; 231: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 6Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). A third class of Ras effectors is a family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGDS, RGL, and Rlf/RGL2) that serve as activators of the Ral small GTPases (7Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Wolthuis R.M. Bos J.L. Curr. Opin.

The contribution of PI3K and RalGDS to Ras transformation has been supported by studies with effector domain mutants (E37G and Y40C) of activated Ha-RasVal-12 that cause the loss of Raf binding and consequently a failure to activate ERKs (6Rodriguez-Viciana P.

RasVal-12/Gly-37 is also impaired in interaction with PI3K but retains interaction with RalGDS, whereas the RasVal-12/Cys-40 mutant is impaired in interaction with RalGDS but retains interaction with PI3K. The ability of both mutants to cause growth transformation of NIH 3T3 cells demonstrates that Ras can also cause transformation by Raf-independent pathways. One aspect of Ras signaling clearly important for growth transformation involves regulation of components of the cell cycle machinery that is critical for progression through the G1 phase (12Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R258-R260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 14Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A significant component of Ras regulation of cell cycle progression involves Ras stimulation of events that lead to the hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of the Rb tumor suppressor protein (15Peeper D.S. Upton T.M. Ladha M.H. Neuman E. Zalvide J. Bernards R. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Nature. 1997; 386: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Rb hyperphosphorylation then results in the release of bound E2F transcription factors, thus allowing E2F to stimulate the transcription of genes whose products promote G1progression (16Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4960) Google Scholar). Although how Ras causes inactivation of the Rb pathway has been studied extensively, a clear understanding of this process remains to be determined. The prevailing evidence implicates Ras regulation of both positive (cyclin D1) and negative (p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1) factors in causing Rb inactivation to promote G1 progression. However, which Ras effector pathway regulates these cell cycle components and how their functions are then altered are not clearly understood. The lack of a coherent picture of Ras and cell cycle regulation is due, in part, to differences in experimental analyses (transient versus stable Ras activation) and to cell type differences (fibroblasts versusepithelial cells) in how Ras functions. Additionally, although p21 and p27 can act as inhibitors of cyclin D-CDK complexes, they may also serve a positive role in G1 progression by promoting cyclin D-CDK assembly and nuclear localization. Much of our knowledge has come from the study of fibroblast models. Thus, whether the links between Ras and the cell cycle in epithelial cells, the cell type from which the majority of ras mutation positive cancers arise, will show cell type differences is not clear. The best characterized cell cycle target of Ras is cyclin D1. Cyclin D1, a major positive regulator of cell cycle progression, is up-regulated in response to both transient and sustained Ras activation in a variety of cell types (17Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633PubMed Google Scholar, 18Liu J.J. Chao J.R. Jiang M.C. Ng S.Y. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell.

Bath M.L. Lindeman G.J. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Increased cyclin D1 facilitates increased formation of active cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4 and CDK6) complexes that phosphorylate and inactivate Rb function. Ras up-regulation of cyclin D1 protein expression is mediated, in large part, by stimulation of transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter (19Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). To date, this up-regulation has been attributed mainly to Ras activation of the Raf/ERK pathway. However, a contribution of PI3K and RalGDS effector pathways has also been shown (23Diehl J.A.

The second most studied link between Ras and cell cycle regulation involves the regulation of expression of the p21CIP1 CDK inhibitor. The levels of p21 are low during quiescence and tend to increase in response to mitogenic stimuli, particularly those that activate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (25Lloyd A.C. Obermüller F. Staddon S. Barth C.F. McMahon M. Land H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, the majority of observations suggest that p21 antagonizes Ras growth stimulation. Transient activation of low levels of Ras or Raf in NIH 3T3 cells did not induce p21 expression and caused a mitogenic response (27Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 28Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In contrast, high Ras or Raf induction caused an up-regulation of p21 and was growth inhibitory. Similarly, it was observed that microinjection of activated Ras alone into Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts induced p21 and did not stimulate proliferation, whereas co-expression of activated RhoA prevented p21 induction and thereby allowed Ras to induce a proliferative response (29Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for p21 in antagonizing Ras function, loss of p21 but not p27 function in primary mouse keratinocytes caused increased susceptibility to transformation by oncogenic Ras (30Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Finally, ectopic expression of p21 inhibited Ras transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (31Michieli P. Li W. Lorenzi M.V. Miki T. Zakut R. Givol D. Pierce J.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 775-784PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is currently believed that oncogenic Ras down-regulation of p21 expression, via the Raf/ERK pathway, is required for Ras to cause growth transformation. A link between Ras and a second CDK inhibitor p27KIP1, where Ras causes down-regulation of p27 expression via the Raf/ERK pathway, has also been observed in a variety of cell types. p27 protein levels are regulated post-translationally and exhibit a pattern of expression that is opposite that of p21. p27 levels are elevated in quiescent cells and down-regulated in response to mitogenic stimuli via a Ras-dependent mechanism (32Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 33Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection of activated Ras caused transient down-regulation of p27 in Swiss 3T3 cells (29Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Transient activation of Raf-1 or MEK1 activation caused down-regulation of p27 protein levels in NIH 3T3 cells (21Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Greulich H. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13280-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sustained expression of oncogenic Ras caused a down-regulation of p27 protein levels in CCL39 fibroblasts and IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells that was dependent on the Raf/ERK pathway (35Yang J.J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36Rivard N. Boucher M.J. Asselin C. L'Allemain G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C652-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, p27 levels were unchanged in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (37Yang J.J. Kang J.S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2586-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and induction of activated MEK did not cause down-regulation of p27 in NIH 3T3 cells (38Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Thus, whether a down-regulation of p27 is required for Ras transformation and how Ras might regulate p27 expression are issues that are currently not clearly understood. Previously, we reported that the Raf/ERK cascade alone, although necessary, was not sufficient for Ras to cause transformation of RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells (39Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Based on the importance of the Raf/ERK pathway in the deregulation of cell cycle components in rodent fibroblasts, the failure of Raf to cause transformation of RIE-1 cells suggests that activation of the Raf/ERK pathway alone may not be sufficient to inactivate the Rb pathway in RIE-1 cells. Alternatively, both Ras and Raf may cause Rb inactivation, but this alone is not sufficient, and Ras causes additional changes required to deregulate cell cycle progression. In the present study, we evaluated whether the contribution of the Raf/ERK pathway to Ras deregulation of cell cycle progression differs in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and RIE-1 epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate cell type differences in Ras regulation of cell cycle progression and the importance of Raf-independent signaling pathways in Ras transformation of epithelial cells. Mammalian expression vectors containing cDNA sequences encoding constitutively activated mutants of Ras (Ha-RasLeu-61, K-Ras4BVal-12, and N-RasAsp-12) or Raf-1 (the NH2-terminal truncated and constitutively 22W mutant or the constitutively membrane-targeted Raf-CAAX mutant) were generated using pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 retrovirus vector with a neomycin resistance marker where expression of the inserted gene is regulated from the Moloney retrovirus long terminal repeat promoter and have been described previously (39Oldham S.M.

Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The pBSTR1 mammalian expression vector encoding human cyclin D1 cDNA expression vector, as described previously (44Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce F.M. Breakefield X.O. Reeves S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is under the control of a tetracycline-repressible CMV promoter and also contains a puromycin-selectable marker. Western blot analyses to verify expression were done using monoclonal antibodies against cyclin D1 (17–32G-11 and HD-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal antibodies against an amino-terminal peptide of rat cyclin E (sc-481; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-Raf-1 (C-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p21WAF (Ab4/5; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-Rb monoclonal antibody (14001A; PharMingen) which detects both active hypophosphorylated Rb and inactive hyperphosphorylated Rb. RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. The introduction of plasmid DNA constructs into NIH 3T3 cells was done by calcium phosphate precipitation (45Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), whereas RIE-1 cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. To establish cell lines of NIH 3T3 or RIE-1 cells stably expressing activated Ras (Ha-RasLeu-61, N-RasAsp-12, or K-Ras4BVal-12) or Raf-22W, transfected cultures were maintained in growth medium supplemented with 400 μg per ml of G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.), and multiple G418-resistant colonies (>50) were pooled together and used for analyses. Some analyses were also performed on RIE-1 cells stably infected with pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 retrovirus vector constructs expressing activated Ha-RasLeu-61, K-RasVal-12, N-RasAsp-12, or Raf-22W. The resulting cell lines were designated NIH(Ras) and NIH(Raf) or RIE(Ras) and RIE(Raf). The U0126 MEK1/2 (provided by J. Trzaskos; DuPont) and LY294002 PI3K (Sigma) inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and control cultures were treated with the equivalent final concentrations of Me2SO (vehicle). To determine if cyclin D1 overexpression, either alone or in cooperation with Raf-22W, could transform RIE-1 cells, co-transfection focus-formation assays were performed. Cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of empty pZIP-NeoSV(x)1, pZIP-K-ras(12V), or pZIP-raf-22W, either alone or together with 0.5 μg of pCMV-cyclin D1. The appearance of transformed foci was quantitated after 21 days. Asynchronous, exponentially growing subconfluent cultures of cells were harvested with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). After separation by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk, probed with the appropriate antibody for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed, probed with the appropriate secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, washed, and exposed to x-ray film. For transient expression reporter assays, parental RIE-1 cells were transfected with Superfect or Effectene (Qiagen) as suggested by the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, RIE-1 cells were seeded the day before transfection and transfected with cationic lipids for 24 h. The growth medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and harvested with 300 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (PharMingen), and 50 μl of lysate was analyzed by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence). To normalize fold activation of the reporter construct to protein levels, protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). The cyclin D1-luciferase construct consists of 963 base pairs of wild type sequences or sequences with point mutation altering the AP1 site of the human cyclin D1 promoter controlling the expression of the luciferase gene (19Albanese C.

The E2F-1-responsive luciferase promoter was provided by P. Farnham and has been described previously (46Hsiao K.M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) Cyclin D1-associated kinase or CDK4 assays were performed as described previously (47Phelps D.E. Xiong Y. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, RIE-1 cells stably expressing the indicated DNAs were seeded 1–2 days before harvesting. Cyclin D1 or CDK4 were immunoprecipitated (17–32G and anti-mouse CDK4, gift from Y. Xiong, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), and the activity of the complex was determined using 0.5–2 μg of GST-Rb substrate. Reactions were stopped with 2× Laemmli sample buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein substrates, destained, and subsequently dried for 1 h. Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or a PhosphorImager screen was exposed for an appropriate amount of time, with radioactivity then measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For immunoblotting, cells were harvested as described above, and equal protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cyclin E-associated kinase assays were performed as described previous (47Phelps D.E. Xiong Y. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, cyclin E was immunoprecipitated (sc-481; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the activity of the complex was determined using 2 μg of histone H1 as substrate. It is well documented that oncogenic Ras causes up-regulation of cyclin D1, in large part, by activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (12Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R258-R260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 14Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Considering these observations, we sought to determine the importance of Raf-dependent and Raf-independent pathways in the up-regulation of cyclin D1 in RIE-1 epithelial cells. Since we demonstrated previously that Ras, but not Raf, could transform RIE-1 epithelial cells (39Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we postulated that the failure of activated Raf to transform RIE-1 cells may be due to its inability to deregulate cyclin D1 or other key components of the cell cycle machinery. First, we compared the consequences of sustained Ras or Raf activation on cyclin D1 expression in NIH 3T3 and RIE-1 cells. Consistent with previous studies, we observed that NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing activated and transforming mutants of Raf-1 or Ras (designated NIH(Raf) or NIH(Ras), respectively) showed elevated steady state levels of cyclin D1 protein (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, only RIE-1 cells stably expressing activated Ras (RIE(Ras)), and not Raf (RIE(Raf)), showed up-regulated levels of cyclin D1 protein when assayed in either exponentially growing or confluent cultures. Since RIE(Raf) cells are morphologically indistinguishable from those expressing the empty vector, we verified that the activated Raf-22W protein was stably expressed in RIE(Raf) cells and that it caused stable up-regulation of ERK activity (Fig. 6 C). These observations show that activation of a Raf-independent pathway(s) is required for Ras to cause cyclin D1 up-regulation in RIE-1 epithelial cells.Figure 6Inhibition of ERK activation causes morphological reversion of RIE(Ras) cells and decreases cyclin D1 levels. A, cells stably expressing the K-RasVal-12 were seeded, allowed to adhere, and each inhibitor or Me2SO control was added to the growth medium. Concentrations of pharmacological inhibitors used were 10 μm for MEK inhibitor (U0126) and 20 μm for the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). Photos were taken after 48-h treatments. B and C, RIE-1 cells treated with vehicle or drugs were harvested, and total protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay. The relative levels of cyclin D1 protein (B) and phospho-ERK (C) expression were determined by a Western blot of equal total cellular lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we determined whether this increase in cyclin D1 protein levels corresponded to differences in the ability of Raf and Ras to stimulate transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter. For these analyses, transient expression analyses were performed on parental RIE-1 cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding two different activated versions of Raf-1 (Raf-22W or Raf-CAAX) or Ras (Ha-RasLeu-61 or K-RasVal-12) together with a reporter plasmid where the luciferase gene is under the control of the human cyclin D1 promoter. When analyzed in NIH 3T3 cells, we observed that both activated Raf and Ras caused comparable activation of the promoter (data not shown). However, Ras but not Raf, stimulated cyclin D1 transcription when assayed in RIE-1 cells (Fig. 2). Additionally, Northern blot analyses determined that the steady state levels of endogenous cyclin D1 mRNA were elevated in RIE(Ras) but not RIE(Raf) cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the Ras-mediated increase in cyclin D1 protein is due, in part, to increased transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter via stimulation of Raf-independent pathways. Next, we determined if the elevated levels of cyclin D1 protein observed in Ras-transformed RIE-1 cells corresponded to increased cyclin D1-associated kinase activity.In vitro kinase assays were performed on immunoprecipitated cyclin D1 and showed that there was an increase in cyclin D1-associated kinase activity in RIE(Ras) but not RIE(Raf) cells (Fig. 3 A). We also determined that cyclin E-associated kinase activity (Fig. 3 B), as well as CDK4 activity (due to cyclin D1 and D2 association; Fig. 3 C) were elevated in RIE(Ras) but not RIE(Raf) cells. Thus, Ras activation of CDK activity important for G1 progression was critically dependent on activation of Raf-independent signaling. We then determined if this corresponded to an increased hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of Rb. By using"

N., Kjeldsen, E., Straub, T., Knudsen, B. K., Kikuchi, A., Hickson, I. D., Kreipe, H., and Boege, F. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 136, 775–788). Here, we confirm colocalization of Ki-S1 with the centrosomal marker γ-tubulin. In addition, we show labeling of centrosomes by peptide antibodies against the N and C termini of human topoisomerase IIα. Probing Western blots of isolated centrosomes with topoisomerase IIα antibodies, we demonstrate a protein band of 170 kDa. Moreover, isolated centrosomes exhibited DNA decatenation and relaxation activity correlated to the amount of topoisomerase IIα protein in the same way as seen in the pure recombinant enzyme. Topoisomerase IIα epitopes could not be removed from centrosomes by salt extraction, DNase treatment, or RNase treatment, procedures that completely removed the enzyme from nuclei. Taken together, these observations suggest that active topoisomerase IIα is bound tightly to the centrosome in a DNA-independent manner. Because such centrosomal topoisomerase IIα was also present in quiescent lymphocytes devoid of topoisomerase IIα in the nuclei, we assume that it might be a long-lived storage form. Recently, we reported that the monoclonal antibody specific for human DNA topoisomerase IIα, Ki-S1, stains not only the nuclei of human A431 cells but also extranuclear structures suggestive of centrosomes (Meyer, K.

Kreipe H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1302-1308PubMed Google Scholar) labels not only the cell nuclei (a long-standing observation) but also labels small globular structures located at the poles of mitotic spindles (a new finding). Ki-S1 labeling of extranuclear globules was reproducible in two human cell lines, whereas a similar observation was not made with antibodies directed against DNA topoisomerase I or IIβ. We assumed that these Ki-S1-positive extranuclear structures would most likely be centrosomes. However, they could just as well be chromosome fragments or micronuclei, or the staining could be due to a spurious cross-reaction of the Ki-S1 antibody with some centrosomal protein other than topoisomerase IIα. However, if such artifacts were excluded, our observation might indicate topoisomerase IIα as a possible component of centrosomes. We found our chance observation interesting enough to be followed up. Here, we carried out immunocytochemical colocalization studies combining antibodies against γ-tubulin (an established centrosomal marker) with antibodies against several distinct epitopes of DNA topoisomerase IIα. We corroborated such studies by biochemical analysis of isolated centrosomes. Our results confirm that active DNA topoisomerase IIα is associated with centrosomes. Human A431 epidermoid cells (ATCC #1555) were cultured as described previously (2Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J.

Human lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral venous blood samples by density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) and subsequently cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. A431 cells were grown directly on microscopic slides, whereas lymphocytes were subjected to cytospinning (500 × g, 15 min). Fixing and immunostaining of the cells have been described previously (1Grue P. Gräβer A. Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Uhse A. Straub T. Ness W. Boege F. J. Biol.

Topoisomerase IIα was detected with the mouse monoclonal antibody Ki-S1 or rabbit peptide antibodies against the very C or N termini of the enzyme (3Boege F. Andersen A. Jensen S. Zeidler R. Kreipe H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1302-1308PubMed Google Scholar). For preabsorption of topoisomerase IIα antibodies, pure recombinant human topoisomerase IIα (100 μg/ml) was inactivated at 60 °C for 10 min and added to the final incubation solution containing the primary antibodies. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the samples were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), and the supernatant was used for immunostaining. Centrosomes were labeled with mouse monoclonal (clone GTU-88) or rabbit peptide antibodies, both directed against amino acids 38–53 of human γ-tubulin. These antibodies were diluted according to the instructions of the supplier (Sigma-Chemie, Deisenhofen, Germany). Stained cells were inspected with an epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop 25; Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) at ×630 magnification. Microscopic images were documented with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Sensys; Photometrics, München, Germany) equipped with an additional ×4 magnification lens providing a final magnification of ×2520. As outlined briefly in the legend to Fig. 5 a, A431 cells were treated (4 °C, 10 min) and washed twice with lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml spermine, 7.5 μg/ml spermidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmPefablock, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5% Triton X-100) while still attached to the culture dish. Cell remnants were scraped off, suspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 10 units/ml RNase A, and subjected to differential centrifugation at 3,000 × g(4 °C, 15 min) and 38,000 × g (4 °C, 120 min) to sediment nuclei and microsomes, respectively. Nuclei were salt-extracted (4 °C, 5 min, 3.3 × 106 nuclei/ml) with 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm Pefablock, followed by a second centrifugation (13,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). The supernatant (nuclear extract) was used for further assays. Centrosomes were isolated from microsome fractions by isopyknic sucrose gradient densitity centrifugation following the procedures described in Ref. 4Bornens M. Paintrand M. Berges J. Marty M.-C. Karsenti E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar. Briefly, microsome pellets were digested with DNase I (50 units/ml, 20 min, 20 °C), resedimented, resuspended in lysis buffer, and layered on top of sucrose gradients created by stacking 1-ml portions of lysis buffer supplemented with 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10% (w/v) sucrose inside a 14 × 95-mm polycarbonate ultracentrifugation tube, followed by equilibration (4 °C, 48 h). After ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g, 4 °C, 24 h (SW 40 TI; Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA)), the gradients were collected from the bottom of the tubes (10 fractions at 1.2 ml). The actual sucrose concentration of each fraction was measured by optical diffraction. The fractions were diluted 20-fold with lysis buffer, sedimented (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), and subjected to immunoblotting or topoisomerase activity assays.Figure 5Immunoblotting of topoisomerase IIα. a, cell fractionation.

The final supernatant (S) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid.b, Western blots of nuclear extracts equivalent to 105 cells (N), microsomes equivalent to 106 cells (M), and final supernatant equivalent to 107 cells (S) were probed with peptide antibodies against the C terminus (panel 1) or the N terminus (panel 2) of human topoisomerase IIα, with the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1 (panel 3), or with peptide antibodies against the C terminus of human topoisomerase IIβ (panel 4). Molecular masses (in kDa) denoted on theright margin were derived from comparison with marker proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A431 cells were grown on microscopic slides and lysed in situ (see the previous paragraph). Cell remnants were then subjected to a series of extraction procedures and finally fixed and immunostained. Extraction procedures included treatment with 500 mm NaCl (conditions were the same as those used for nuclear extraction, see the previous paragraph), followed by DNase I (1 unit/slide), followed by RNase A (10 μg/slide). Digestions were carried out at 20 °C for 20 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. Between treatments, slides were washed (three times) with phosphate-buffered isotonic saline solution. Analysis of topoisomerase IIα was essentially performed as described in Ref. 2Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar. However, microsome pellets and isolated centrosomes were digested with DNase I (50 units/ml, 20 min, 20 °C) and resedimented before electrophoresis. Blots were probed with peptide antibodies against C and N termini of human topoisomerase IIα (3Boege F. Andersen A. Jensen S. Zeidler R. Kreipe H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1302-1308PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of γ-tubulin, the samples were separated in 10% gels, and the blots were probed with the same antibodies used for immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibody-labeled protein bands were visualized with peroxidase-labeled goat secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chelfordshire, United Kingdom). Signals of immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using a transilluminating flat-bed scanner and NIH Image 1.61 software. Topoisomerase II-specific activity was determined by decatenation ofCrithidia fasciculata catenated kinetoplast DNA (kDNA)1 obtained from TopoGen Inc. (Columbus, OH). Centrosomes or pure recombinant human DNA topoisomerase IIα were suspended/diluted with assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP) and incubated with 360 ng of kDNA in a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions at 37 °C were stopped after 4 h with 1% SDS followed by proteinase K digestion. Samples were then subjected to submarine agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were documented by digital photography (EDAS 120; Kodak, Frankfurt, Germany). For a more precise quantitation of catalytic activity, relaxation kinetics of 120 ng of pUC18 plasmid DNA were determined in a similar fashion. In this case, electrophoresis was carried out in the absence of ethidium bromide, and gels were stained after the run. Because quantitative statistics could not be applied to the data, representative examples of experimental results are shown. Microscopic images of cells are representative of the whole cell population on the slide inspected in at least 10 separate fields of view. For all data shown (microscopy, catalytic assays, and immunoblotting), similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments done on different days and with different sets of cells. Fig. 1 shows immunofluorescent images of human A431 cells stained with the topoisomerase IIα-specific monoclonal antibody Ki-S1 (top) and the corresponding DNA patterns obtained with DAPI (bottom). In mitotic cells, the Ki-S1 antibody labeled a dotted structure along the central axes of the chromosome arms that represents an established finding (1Grue P. Gräβer A. Sehested M. Jensen P.B.

In addition, it labeled small globular structures located at the spindle poles of mitotic cells that did not show up in the DAPI staining. Such apparently DNA-free globules were also labeled in the extranuclear space of A431 cells during interphase (Fig. 1, arrows). To obtain a definite assignment of these structures, we stained the cells simultaneously with antibodies against γ-tubulin, a specific marker of centrosomes (Fig. 1, middle). Apparently, γ-tubulin and Ki-S1 antibodies labeled the same globular structures, thus establishing their identity as centrosomes (Fig. 1, compare the top with the middle). It should be noted that all centrosomes were labeled by both antibodies. This was also the case in polyploid cells with multiple sets of centrosomes (Fig. 1, large cell on theleft). Ki-S1 labeling of centrosomes could be abolished by preabsorption with purified recombinant human topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 2 a, top), whereas the γ-tubulin signal serving as an internal control of the preabsorption procedure was not diminished (Fig. 2 a, middle). These results confirmed that Ki-S1 antibodies labeled centrosomes in a topoisomerase IIα-specific manner. Fig. 2 b shows a series of triple labelings similar to those described in Fig. 1 but carried out on cytospins of quiescent human lymphocytes isolated from peripheral venous blood and subsequently cultured for 12 h. The nuclei of such cells were not labeled by Ki-S1 antibodies (Fig. 2 b, top), which is in agreement with previous data (9Kreipe H. Heidebrecht H.J. Hansen S. Rohlk W. Kubbies M. Wacker H.H. Tiemann M. Radzun H.J. Parwaresch R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the centrosomes were strongly stained, which represents a novel finding. Again, the Ki-S1 epitope clearly colocalized with γ-tubulin (Fig. 2 b, middle). These observations suggest that labeling of centrosomes by Ki-S1 antibodies is not a peculiarity of tumor cell lines and that expression of the Ki-S1 epitope in centrosomes is not restricted to proliferating cells, which is in clear contrast to expression in the nuclei (9Kreipe H. Heidebrecht H.J. Hansen S. Rohlk W. Kubbies M. Wacker H.H. Tiemann M. Radzun H.J. Parwaresch R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar, 10Turley H. Comley M. Houlbrook S. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Gatter K. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 1 could indicate that topoisomerase IIα is a component of centrosomes, provided that the centrosomal Ki-S1 epitope was associated or related to topoisomerase IIα. On the other hand, they could just be due to a spurious cross-reaction of the Ki-S1 antibody with a centrosomal protein other than topoisomerase IIα. We tried to distinguish between these alternatives by another series of immunofluorescent double labelings combining the Ki-S1 antibody, which targets an epitope adjacent to the C terminus of human topoisomerase IIα, with rabbit peptide antibodies directed against the very C- or N-terminals of the enzyme (9Kreipe H. Heidebrecht H.J. Hansen S. Rohlk W. Kubbies M. Wacker H.H. Tiemann M. Radzun H.J. Parwaresch R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar). It turned out that both peptide antibodies (Fig. 3, a andb, middle) labeled the centrosomes of A431 cells in the same way as the Ki-S1 antibody (Fig. 3, a and b, top). Because the three sets of antibodies target distinct and distant epitopes of human topoisomerase IIα, spurious cross-reactions with centrosomal proteins unrelated to topoisomerase IIα seemed unlikely. Consequently, we adopted the hypothesis that topoisomerase IIα might indeed be present at the centrosome.Figure 3a, fluorescent images of A431 cells in logarithmic growth labeled simultaneously with the mouse monoclonal antibody Ki-S1 directed against topoisomerase IIα (top), rabbit peptide antibodies directed against the last 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of human topoisomerase IIα (middle), and DAPI (bottom). b, fluorescent images of A431 cells in logarithmic growth labeled simultaneously with the mouse monoclonal antibody Ki-S1 directed against topoisomerase IIα (top), rabbit peptide antibodies directed against the first 12 C-terminal amino acid residues of topoisomerase IIα (middle), and DAPI (bottom). In both cases (a and b), representative cells are visualized at ×2520 magnification. The scale bars in the DAPI images (bottom) apply to all panels of the respective columns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From this assumption followed the question of whether topoisomerase IIα is an integral centrosomal protein (i.e. a component of the salt-stable centrosomal core), and, if so, whether it is bound there in a manner involving DNA or RNA. To address these issues, we applied various extraction procedures to A431 cells grown on microscope slides, and immunostained residual topoisomerase IIα still attached to cellular structures after the treatment. These experiments are summarized in Fig. 4 showing representative cells in interphase (Fig. 4 a) or mitosis (Fig. 4 b). In each column, the same cell is visualized by phase-contrast (row 1) or triple fluorescence labeling of topoisomerase IIα (row 2), γ-tubulin (row 3), and DNA (row 4). The first column on the left of each panel shows the control, i.e. cells not extracted before staining (similar to those in Fig. 1). Extraction with 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 4, 0.5 mNaCl) removed most of the topoisomerase IIα from the cell nuclei, whereas the centrosome-bound enzyme was not extracted. Subsequent DNase I digestion of salt-extracted cells (Fig. 4, DNase I) effectively removed all of the DNA from the nuclei. It also removed that tiny portion of nuclear topoisomerase IIα that had resisted previous salt extraction. However, the centrosome-bound portion of the enzyme was again unaffected. It remained bound to the salt- and DNase-stable centrosome core. Finally, the centrosome-bound fraction of topoisomerase IIα was also resistant to subsequent RNase A digestion (Fig. 4, RNase), excluding the possibility that it might be incorporated into salt-stable ribonucleoprotein complexes, as has been reported of Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II (11Meller V. McConnell M. Fisher P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In summary, these findings suggest that topoisomerase IIα is an integral component of the centrosome and that it is tightly bound in a manner that does not involve DNA or RNA. Subsequently, we set out to corroborate our immunocytological findings by biochemical approaches. First, we probed Western blots of microsomes prepared from A431 cells with the same set of antibodies used in Fig. 3. As outlined in Fig. 5 a, lipids and cytosol of A431 cells were first removed by in situ lysis with 0.5% Triton X-100. Residual cell structures were fractionated into nuclei (N) and microsomes (M). Nuclei were subsequently salt-extracted, whereas microsomes were DNase I-digested (to dissolve contaminating chromatin fragments). Finally, Western blots of nuclear extracts and microsomes were probed with polyclonal peptide antibodies against the C and N termini of topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 5 b, panels 1 and 2, respectively), with monoclonal Ki-S1 antibodies (Fig. 5 b, panel 3), or with polyclonal peptide antibodies against the C terminus of topoisomerase IIβ (Fig. 5 b, panel 4). Topoisomerase IIα was clearly detected at its usual position (equivalent to a molecular size of 170 kDa) in the nuclear extracts and in the microsomes, whereas topoisomerase IIβ (serving as internal control) was only detected in the nuclear extract and was not detected in the microsome fraction. It should be noted that topoisomerase I was also not detectable in the microsome fraction (data not shown). These latter observations exclude a contamination of the microsome fraction with nuclei or chromatin fragments. Thus, the data in Fig. 5 b confirm our immunocytological observations, demonstrating that the topoisomerase IIα protein of 170 kDa is present in particulate structures outside the cell nucleus (whereas topoisomerase IIβ is not). To assign the extranuclear topoisomerase IIα fraction to the centrosomes (among other microsomal components), we sedimented microsomes through a sucrose density gradient and probed Western blots of the gradient fractions with antibodies against γ-tubulin and topoisomerase IIα. These data are summarized in Fig. 6. As expected from the literature (4Bornens M. Paintrand M. Berges J. Marty M.-C. Karsenti E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), most of the centrosomes present in the loaded material entered the gradient and formed a distinct peak at sucrose concentrations of 38–48% (Fig. 6 a, fractions 2–4) that was clearly defined by the γ-tubulin marker (Fig. 6 a, middle). Topoisomerase IIα protein (Fig. 6, top) cosedimented with the γ-tubulin marker and peaked in the same fractions (i.e. fractions 2–4). Fig. 6 b shows a representative image of a peak fraction sedimented onto a microscopic slide and double-stained for topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 6 b, top) and γ-tubulin (Fig. 6 b, bottom). It attests to the fact that (i) these fractions consisted of centrosomes, (ii) all centrosomes present were stained by γ-tubulin and topoisomerase IIα antibodies, and (iii) topoisomerase IIα-positive structures other than centrosomes were absent in these fractions. Thus, the data in Figs. 5and 6 confirm that the “normal” topoisomerase IIα protein of 170 kDa is a constituent of centrosomes. These observations raised the obvious question of whether centrosomal topoisomerase IIα actually has a type II DNA topoisomerase activity. Unfortunately, the most straightforward approach to this question was blocked because the topoisomerase IIα protein could not be extracted from centrosome particles (see Fig. 4) and consequently could not be purified in a native configuration. Therefore, we had to subject whole centrosome particles to topoisomerase activity assays. For this purpose, we incubated centrosomes isolated by sucrose density centrifugation (see Fig. 6) with kDNA. Fig. 7 a shows a typical result demonstrating that isolated centrosomes did indeed have DNA decatenation activity. Moreover, the centrosomal activity appeared to be of the same order of magnitude as that of pure solute human topoisomerase IIα produced in yeast (Fig. 7 a, comparelanes 2–4 with lanes 6–8; the insetshows the corresponding normalization of topoisomerase IIα protein by immunoblotting.). Because kDNA decatenation is not considered a very accurate quantitative assay (particularly when agents of very different sizes are compared, as in this case), we also performed comparative DNA plasmid relaxation kinetics using the same matched preparations of isolated centrosomes and recombinant topoisomerase IIα as used in Fig. 7 a. A corresponding result is shown in Fig. 7 b. It confirmed that the DNA relaxation activity of pure solute topoisomerase IIα was virtually the same as that of isolated centrosomes containing a similar amount of topoisomerase IIα protein. The most likely interpretation of these data seems to be that active topoisomerase IIα is present at the centrosome. However, we cannot altogether exclude that the topoisomerase II activity undisputably present in the centrosome preparations might be due to an entirely different protein, whereas the topoisomerase IIα protein detectable by immunoblotting is inactive and only coincidentally present in amounts fitting the activity. In this unlikely case, one would have to postulate the existence of a third hitherto unknown topoisomerase II isoform because topoisomerase IIβ was clearly not present at the centrosome (see Fig. 5 b, panel 4). The centrosome controls assembly of microtubules, a process that plays a central role in organizing cell structure, determining cell polarity, directing cell movement during interphase, and orchestrating formation of the bipolar spindle during mitosis (12Kellogg D.R. Moritz M. Alberts B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 639-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the centrosome is comprised of a pair of centrioles and pericentriolar material initially denoted as “differentiated cytoplasm” (13Boveri T. Jena Z. Med. Naturw. 1901; 28: 1-220Google Scholar). The centrioles seem to be needed for organizing centrosomal components into a structural stable organelle (14Bobinnec Y. Khodjakov A. Mir L. Rieder C. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1575-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), whereas the pericentriolar material contains highly ordered structures composed of γ-tubulin, pericentrin, and other proteins, which control the assembly of microtubules (15Young A. Dictenberg J. Purohit A. Tuft R. Doxsey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Stearns T. Winey M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, the centrosome also seems to serve as a “landing pad” for many proteins that have nothing to do with the organization of microtubuli (17Zimmerman W. Sparks C. Doxsey S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), including adaptors (19Schmidt P. Dransfield D. Claudio J. Hawley R. Trotter K. Milgram S. Goldenring J. J. Biol.

Some of these seem to be instrumental in centrosome replication (24Lacey K. Jackson P. Stearns T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 25Hinchcliffe E. Li C. Thompson E. Maller J. Sluder G.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas others are believed to associate with centrosomes only as passengers (27Compton D.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28Hsu L.-C. White R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence strongly suggesting that DNA topoisomerase IIα is also present at the centrosome. However, we can only speculate about the biological function of the enzyme at this location. Centrosomal topoisomerase IIα is characterized by several features that distinguish it from the nuclear variety. Most notably, it appears to be very tightly bound to the salt-stable centrosome core in a manner not involving DNA or RNA. This raises the question of how it gets there and how it is fixed. Recent evidence suggests that the centrosomal adaptor protein 14-3-3 ε believed to link mitotic signaling to centrosome duplication (20Pietromonaco S.F. Seluja G.A. Aitken A. Elias L. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1996; 22: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is capable of binding strongly to topoisomerase IIα in vitro (29Gieseler F. Kurz E. Clark M. Leader K. Kroll D. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 209Google Scholar). Thus, it might be involved in recruiting and fixing topoisomerase IIα to the centrosome. However, it remains unclear why controsomes should have a type II topoisomerase activity at all. It is hard to imagine that the DNA-modifying enzyme plays a role in the organization of microtubuli. Some other cell cycle-related proteins have been proposed to associate with centrosomes during mitosis to achieve appropriate distribution between the two daughter cells (27Compton D.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28Hsu L.-C. White R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, such a mechanism would not be meaningful for a chromosome-bound enzyme, such as topoisomerase IIα (2Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Sumner A.T. Chromosome Res. 1996; 4: 4-15Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which gets equally distributed between daughter cells via the chromosomes. A hint at a possible biological meaning of centrosomal topoisomerase IIα might be provided by our finding of the enzyme at centrosomes of quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes, which are devoid of topoisomerase IIα-specific mRNA and do not have topoisomerase IIα in the nucleus (30Chaly N. Chen X. Dentry J. Brown D. Chromosome Res. 1996; 4: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The finding suggests a significantly extended life span of the centrosomal enzyme, as compared with the nuclear variety. Possibly, topoisomerase IIα is stored and propagated at the centrosome independently of the extensive up- and down-regulations taking place in the nucleus (2Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Chaly N. Chen X. Dentry J. Brown D.

Such a source of spare topoisomerase IIα would be particularly meaningful for intermittently quiescent cells (such as lymphocytes) because it could safegard cells from mitotic catastrophes otherwise likely encountered during unscheduled attempts at mitosis in the complete absence of active topoisomerase IIα (1Grue P.

The argument is supported to some extent by our observation that only topoisomerase IIα is present at the centrosome, whereas topoisomerase IIβ is not. We have recently shown that essential mitotic functions of topoisomerase IIα are not adopted by topoisomerase IIβ (1Grue P. Gräβer A. Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Uhse A. Straub T. Ness W. Boege F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33660-33666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas topoisomerase IIα can, at least in cells, fully complement a lack of topoisomerase IIβ (35Yang X. Li W. Prescott E. Burden S.J. Wang J. Science. 2000; 128: 131-134Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, it would make sense to keep spare topoisomerase IIα but not spare topoisomerase IIβ at the centrosome.

Gel shift analysis shows specific binding to this site in nuclear extracts from U937 cells. Mutation of the Ets consensus site significantly reduces FUTIV promoter activity in both cell lines. Gel supershift and dominant negative cotransfection experiments identified the Ets family member Elk-1 as one component binding and regulating the FUTIV promoter in U937 cells.

FUTIVpromoter/reporter fusion constructs defined a “full-length” promoter and highly active fragments in the macrophage-derived U937 and myeloid HL60 cell lines. One highly active fragment contains a consensus binding site for the Ets-1 transcription factor (Withers, D. A., and Hakomori, S. (1997) Glycoconj. J. 14, 764). Gel shift analysis shows specific binding to this site in nuclear extracts from U937 cells. Mutation of the Ets consensus site significantly reduces FUTIV promoter activity in both cell lines. Gel supershift and dominant negative cotransfection experiments identified the Ets family member Elk-1 as one component binding and regulating the FUTIV promoter in U937 cells. The significance of FUTIV regulation by Elk-1 is discussed. fucosyltransferase reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay kilobase pair(s) rapid amplification of cDNA ends Among nine fucosyltransferases (FucTs)1 expressed in animal cells (FucTI–FucTIX; see “Discussion”), FucTIV is of great biological interest based on results from two areas of study. One area is early embryogenesis, in which expression of Lex epitope becomes maximal at morula-stage preimplantation embryo, and declines quickly thereafter, by conversion to Ley expressed at the surface of blastocyst. Recent studies indicate that Lexexpression in embryonal carcinoma F9 cells is due to expression of theFUTIV gene (1Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lex at morula stage is thought to cause compaction, the first cell adhesion event during embryogenesis, in which Lex-Lex interaction plays a major role (2Eggens I. Fenderson B.A. Toyokuni T. Dean B.

Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) prior to uvomorulin (cadherin)-dependent adhesion (4Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion based on Lex glycolipid was confirmed recently (5Boubelı́k M. Floryk D. Bohata J. Dráberová L. Macák J. Smı́d F. Dráber P. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). FucTIV is also involved in synthesis of the cell surface epitope, so-called myeloglycan, consisting of unbranched long chain type 2 poly-N-acetyllactosamine having α1→3 fucosylation at multiple internal G1cNAc with α2→3 sialylation at terminal Gal (6Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Myeloglycan is considered the major physiological E-selectin epitope controlling tethering and rolling of neutrophils on solid phase E-selectin, particularly under dynamic flow conditions (7Handa K. Stroud M.R. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12412-12420Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression of FucTVII is responsible for α1→3 fucosylation at penultimate G1cNAc, but penultimate fucosylation by FucTVII is inhibited by internal α1→3 fucosylation by FucTIV. Thus, FucTIV is responsible mainly for synthesis of myeloglycan without fucosylation at penultimate GlcNAc, i.e., without sialyl-Lex (8Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1998; 243: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Various types of tumor express myeloglycan-type structures (9Fukushi Y. Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Rauvala H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10511-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may mediate E-selectin-dependent metastasis (for review, see Ref. 10Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the α1,3-FUT gene family has been examined for lung (11Ogawa J. Inoue H. Koide S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 325-329PubMed Google Scholar), colorectal (12Ito H. Hiraiwa N. Sawada-Kasugai M. Akamatsu S. Tachikawa T. Kasai Y. Akiyama S. Ito K. Takagi H. Kannagi R. Int. J.

Acta. 1999; 1428: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) tumors. In all cases, FUTIV expression is significantly higher in tumors than in adjacent non-tumorous tissue. In lung tumors, FUTIVand FUTVII expression levels were inversely correlated with patient prognosis (11Ogawa J. Inoue H. Koide S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 325-329PubMed Google Scholar). FUTIV expression has also been studied in purified myeloid lineage cells and cell lines induced to differentiate (15Clarke J.L. Watkins W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10317-10328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16LeMarer N. Palcic M.M. Clarke J.L. Davies D. Skacel P.O.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Typically, differentiated cells lose surface Lex expression accompanied by a decrement inFUTIV transcript levels as compared with undifferentiated cells. Conversely, the colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 shows elevated FUTIV mRNA levels when apoptosis is induced (18Akamatsu S. Yazawa S. Zenita K. Matsumoto H. Tachikawa T. Kannagi R. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The collective data suggest that Lex, determined by “myeloid type” fucosyltransferase (FucTIV) expression, is an oncofetal marker. Expression is regulated during normal development (16LeMarer N. Palcic M.M. Clarke J.L. Davies D. Skacel P.O. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Miyake M.

Togayachi A. Morozumi K. Watanabe M. Nakamura M. Nishihara S. Narimatsu H. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 797-811PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to identify the trans-acting factors responsible for up-regulating FUTIVexpression in tumor cell lines. Preliminary studies localized upstream genomic DNA fragments with high promoter activity in U937 and HL60 tumor cell lines (21Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 764Google Scholar). 2FUTIV promoter deletion analysis identified a highly active region containing an Ets transcription factor consensus binding site, as reported at the First International Symposium on Glycosyltransferases and Cellular Communications, Mar 26–28, 1997, Osaka, Japan (21Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 764Google Scholar). The data presented here identifies the Ets family member Elk-1 as a positive regulatory factor acting on the FUTIV promoter in U937 cells. A FUTIV genomic clone, λ20, was isolated from a human placental genomic DNA library (Stratagene) while screening with a FUTIII probe. TheEcoRI/NcoI 3.1-kb andBamHI/NcoI 1.65-kb fragments from λ20 were cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3basic (Promega) to make pG-3092Eco and pG-1647Bam, respectively. Using unique restriction sites, deletion derivatives of these constructs were made by simple digestion and recircularization. The consensus Ets-1 site at −350 (from the translational start site) was mutated in promoter fusion constructs using the recombinant PCR technique (22Higuchi R. Innis M. Gelfand D. Sninsky J. White T. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Primary PCR reactions used the −518 (XhoI/NcoI) construct in the pOGH vector (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA) as template. 3′-Primary PCR used a mutated Elk-1 site primer, 3′ELKmut (−361 to −338; 5′-GGGCGCGGCCCTTCAGCCCTCGGG-3′, mutated bases underlined), and a downstream vector primer (5′-TGCAGCTAGGTGAGCTGTC-3′). 5′-Primary PCR used 5′ELKmut primer (complementary to 3′ELKmut) and an upstream vector primer (5′-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG-3′). Secondary PCR used primary PCR fragments as templates and the flanking vector primers. The resulting fragment was digested with BstXI andSfiI and cloned into pG-1647Bam deleted forBstXI/SfiI. Resulting clones were sequenced through the BstXI/SfiI interval. DNA was sequenced either manually using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with an ABI310 automated sequencer. Putative promoter sequences were analyzed for consensus transcription factor binding sites using Transcription Element Search Software (TESS) (23Schug J. Overton G.C. TESS: Transcription Element Search Software on the WWW; Technical Report CBIL-TR-1997-1001-v0.0. Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA1997Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using the Titan™ one-tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HL60 RNA samples were treated with RQ1 DNase (RNase-free; Promega Corp.) or RNase (prepared by boiling for 5 min; DNase-free) to confirm absence of DNA-based PCR. PCR used the following primers; 3′-1 (5′-CAAGTACTATCTGTTCCC-3′) in combination with either 3′-3 (5′-AAACCTGAACTCTTTCCC-3′) or 3′-2 (5′-CTATACCACTGCATTGAC-3′) forFUTIV RT-PCR and FT7us (5′-GCACCCCAGCCCACGATCACC-3′) and FT7ds (5′-CTCAGGCCTGAAACCAACCC-3′) for FUTVII control RT-PCR. Amplification was for 40 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 54 °C (for FUTIV primer combinations) or 58 °C (forFUTVII), followed by 3 min at 72 °C. 3′-RACE was performed using U937 cDNA essentially as described (24Frohman M.A. Innis M. Gelfand D. Sninsky J. White T. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 28-38Google Scholar) except that Elongase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was substituted forTaq polymerase. Nested PCR using first primer 3′-4 (5′-GTATTAAAGTGTGGGCAG-3′) and then primer 3′-5 (5′-GAGTTCAGGTTTTGAAGG-3′) sequentially in combination with the RACE adapter primer, amplified a 2.2-kb fragment. 5′-RACE was modified to include 2% Me2SO and 1 m betaine as described (25Weissensteiner T. Lanchbury J.S. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). U937 RNA was reverse-transcribed, then amplified using first primer 5′-1 (5′-GCGCCGTACACGTCAAG-3′) and then primer 5′-2 (5′-AGCACACAGACGGTCCATGG-3′) sequentially in combination with the RACE adapter primer. Race products were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. U937 and HL60 cell lines were originally purchased from ATCC and maintained in this laboratory. Cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at cell density ≤8 × 105 cells/ml. Cultures were split 1 day prior to electroporation and collected at a culture density of ∼5 × 105 cells/ml. For U937 electroporation, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 250 μl of room temperature RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg of plasmid DNA and transferred to a 0.4-cm gap cuvette. HL60 cells (2 × 106) were resuspended in 400 μl of medium containing 20 μg of DNA. Each electroporation included 1 μg of pXGH5 (growth hormone expression vector) to control for transfection efficiency. Electroporation at 242 V and 975 microfarads (U937) or 260 V and 1,050 microfarads (HL60) was done with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, cells were cultured in a 5-ml final volume of RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. For cotransfection experiments, the Elk-1 dominant negative-expressing plasmid in the pCMV5 vector was used. This plasmid encodes the DNA binding, but lacks the transactivation domain of Elk-1. pCMV5 or pGL3 vectors were used as controls. Cotransfection experiments used 8 μg of reporter plasmid, 2 μg of control or experimental plasmid (pGL3basic, pCMV5, or pCMV5-Elk-Dominant negative), and 1 μg of pXGH5. Electroporated cell extracts were prepared and assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase levels were determined on an EG&G Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer with a 100-μl d-luciferin injection. Growth hormone levels were assayed from the culture medium using the HGH-TGES kit purchased from Nichols Institute (San Juan Capistrano, CA). Extract protein levels were determined by the bicinchonic acid method (Pierce). Luciferase activity was normalized by both growth hormone (transfection efficiency control) and protein levels (cell number control). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dent and Latchman (26Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Rickwood D. Hames B. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1993: 1-26Google Scholar). EMSA and “supershift” experiments were performed essentially as described (26Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Rickwood D. Hames B. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1993: 1-26Google Scholar), except that Tris-glycine (25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA) was used as gel running buffer. Antibodies for supershift were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. RNA isolation used the Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.) acid-phenol procedure, and poly(A)+ RNA was selected using the poly(A)tract mRNA isolation system IV kit from Promega Corp. Northern blots were prepared as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The FUTIV gene produces three transcripts of 2.3, 3.0, and 6.0 kb as detected on Northern blots (15Clarke J.L. Watkins W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10317-10328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Goelz S.E. Hession C. Goff D. Griffiths B. Tizard R. Newman B. Chi-Rosso G.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17467-17477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2.3- and 6.0-kb transcripts are typically detected at much higher abundance than the 3.0-kb species (Fig. 2 B). cDNAs corresponding to the 2.3- and 3.0-kb transcripts were described previously (28Goelz S.E. Hession C. Goff D. Griffiths B. Tizard R. Newman B. Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The derivation of the 6.0-kb transcript, however, is not known and has been suggested to come from an as yet undescribed FUT gene. This possibility led us to further investigate FUTIV gene structure. DNA sequence of a FUTIV 3′-genomic DNA fragment and the FUTIV 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1) were used to synthesize downstream and upstream primers, respectively, for RT-PCR amplification of the putative 6.0-kb transcript. This experiment, shown in Fig. 2 A, clearly detects the presence of another FUTIV transcript containing sequences common to the 3.0- and 2.3-kb FUTIV transcripts (since the upstream primer falls within the 3′-untranslated region of the 2.3- and 3.0-kb transcripts) as well as additional 3′-untranslated sequences. In addition, this RT-PCR-generated fragment detects only a ∼6.0-kb transcript on Northern blots (Fig. 2 B).Figure 1Map of the 11q21 chromosome region encodingFUTIV transcripts. Center line represents genomic DNA containing restriction sites forEcoRI (E), HindIII (H),BamHI (B), NotI (N), andEcoRV (V); large central arrowrepresents protein coding region.

Primers used for RT-PCR and RACE experiments are shown as small arrows. Derivation of probes used to detect FUTIVtranscripts by Northern analysis (Fig. 2 B) is shown at thebottom. Sequences of the 3′-untranslated region of the ∼6.0-kb transcript and the promoter region have been deposited with GenBank under accession numbers AF305083 and AF305082, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using 3′-RACE analysis (24Frohman M.A. Innis M. Gelfand D. Sninsky J. White T. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 28-38Google Scholar), the remainder of this cDNA was cloned. Sequence analysis showed a 3,098-base pair extension from the 3′-most sequences of the 3.0-kb transcript (ELFT-L) to the poly(A) addition site. This cDNA is colinear with genomic DNA (data not shown). The 6.0-kb transcript, which matches previously unassigned clones in the human expressed sequence tag data base, uses an alternate poly(A) addition site from the shorter FUTIV transcripts and appears to differ from them only by the length of 3′-untranslated sequences. RACE was also used to locate the 5′ end of FUTIV transcripts in RNA from U937 cells. Results from this experiment (Fig. 3) show that ∼80% of recovered RACE clones extended to a region approximately 85 base pairs upstream from the start of translation. Two further upstream start sites at −129 and −145 were also detected by this method. An additional low frequencyFUTIV start site, corresponding to the 3.0-kb transcript, is located approximately 550 base pairs upstream from the start of translation (28Goelz S.E. Hession C. Goff D. Griffiths B. Tizard R. Newman B. Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). As is typically true for genes with scattered transcriptional start sites, the FUTIV promoter contains no canonical TATA box. A genomic clone containing FUTIVwas isolated from a placental DNA library (CLONTECH) using FUTIII gene sequences as probe. 3.1 kb extending upstream from the start of translation was subcloned and sequenced (Fig. 3). This fragment matches the restriction map of the FUTIV upstream region (29Lowe J.B. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Marks R.M. Macher B.A. Kelly R.J. Ernst L.K. J. Biol.

Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), thus confirming its identity as FUTIV. Comparison of the FUTIV upstream sequence to a transcription factor consensus binding site data base revealed many matches to described factor binding sites (Fig. 3). The 3.1-kb fragment was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector (pGL3basic) to make “pG-3092Eco.” This “full-length” fragment and deleted or mutated derivatives were transfected intoFUTIV-expressing cell lines U937 and HL60, and luciferase reporter levels were assayed. The longest constructs (pG-3092Eco, pG-2444Nsi, and pG-2145Pac) have undetectable promoter activity in both cell lines (data not shown). Deletion derivatives, such as pG-1800HindIII (data not shown) and pG-1647Bam have high activity in U937 (Fig. 4) and HL60 (data not shown) cell lines. In addition, the internal deletion removing sequences from −424 to −273 from the full-length promoter has significantly reduced activity in U937 cells. Mutation of a consensus Ets-1 binding site at position −350 reduces promoter activity further (Fig. 4). This region was further studied using EMSA in order to localize potential transcription factor binding sites. The 151-base pair interval from −424 to −273 contains a consensus binding site for the Ets family of transcription factors located at −350. Oligonucleotides corresponding to FUTIVpromoter region −350 and containing wild type or mutant Ets binding sites were used in EMSA to detect binding activity in U937 cells (Fig. 5). The Ets mutant oligonucleotide differs from wild type by a three-base substitution at the Ets consensus core sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). At least two binding activities (see s1 and s2 in Fig. 5) were detected with the wild type oligonucleotide. These activities were specific for the Ets consensus site since binding was competed with excess unlabeled wild type, but not mutant, oligonucleotide (Fig. 5,left panel, lanes 2 and3). In addition, s1 and s2 bands were absent when the mutant oligonucleotide was used as probe (Fig. 5,left panel, lane 4). The identity of the factor(s) bound to the FucTIV Ets consensus site was investigated using EMSA and antibodies to various Ets family members (Fig. 5, middle panel). The most abundant specific binding activity (s2) is shifted in mobility upon addition of anti-Elk-1 antibody to the binding reaction (middle panel, lane 3). Ets-1, pu.1 (middle panel, lanes 2 and 4, respectively), Ets-2, and SAP-1 antibodies failed to recognize U937 nuclear proteins bound to this site (data not shown). In addition, the s2 band is absent fromFUTIV-nonexpressing HepG2 cells (Fig. 5, right panel). A promoter fusion construct (pG-1647Bam/−350(Elk−)) was made containing the same Ets-1 site mutation used above for EMSA. When compared with wild type (pG-1647Bam), promoter activity of the Elk-1 site mutant is significantly reduced in U937 cells (see Fig. 4). The role of Elk-1 was further investigated by co-transfection experiments using the FucTIV promoter fusion construct pG-1647Bam, containing either the wild type or mutated Elk-1 −350 site, along with an expression vector encoding dominant negative Elk-1 protein (32Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 6. The data show a dramatic reduction (approximately 5-fold) in promoter activity of the pG-1647Bam construct when co-transfected with the dominant negative Elk-1-encoding, but not the empty vector plasmid. When the mutant Elk site construct was used as reporter, DN-Elk cotransfection reduced promoter activity to the same level seen for the wild type reporter plus DN-Elk cotransfection. The latter data suggest that Elk-1 binds to and regulates other sites in the FUTIV promoter, possibly a weaker consensus site at −610 base pairs (see Fig. 3). Collectively, these data show that Elk-1 binds specifically to the −350 site and regulates expression from theFUTIV promoter. Six human α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase genes (FUTIII–FUTVII and FUTIX) have been described to date (28Goelz S.E. Hession C. Goff D. Griffiths B. Tizard R. Newman B. Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R.

In the forebrain of wild-type mice, administration of a D1receptor agonist leads to c-fos mRNA expression levels that are substantially higher than corresponding levels expressed after indirect stimulation of dopamine receptors with methamphetamine. In mice deficient for D2 and D3 receptors, c-fos mRNA levels expressed in response to D1 agonist administration are significantly blunted. However, a single dose of methamphetamine (5 mg/kg) leads to a long lasting reversal of the blunted c-fos responses in these mutants. In the forebrain, this reversal is restricted to the neocortex. Moreover, methamphetamine also enhances c-fosexpression levels in preadolescent wild-type mice that normally express low c-fos mRNA in response to D1 agonist stimulation. Thus, a single dose of methamphetamine leads to a long term increase in D1 receptor-dependent c-fos responses in brains with either low (preadolescent mice) or blunted (adult D2 and D3 mutant mice) c-fos expression levels. A similar long term reversal of the blunted c-fos responses is achieved with a single dose of a full D1 agonist. These results indicate that the constitutive inactivation of D2 and D3receptors leads to a decrease in agonist-promoted D1receptor activity that can be reversed by intermittent agonist stimulation.

For example, studies on the induction of c-fos in response to an acute administration of drugs of abuse identified a common neuroanatomical pattern of expression (for review see Ref. 1Harlan R.E. Garcia M.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 221-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the subchronic administration of such drugs (which is associated with a progressive sensitization of neuronal systems) leads to distinct alterations in the anatomic pattern of c-fos expression (2Curran E.J. Akil H. Watson S.J. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on mutant mice have demonstrated that the expression of dopamine D1 receptors is essential for the control of immediate-early gene expression by psychomotor stimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine (3Moratalla R. Xu M. Tonegawa S. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14928-14933Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although D1 receptors are essential for the induction of c-fos expression in response to psychostimulants, the magnitude of the D1-dependent c-fos expression levels appears to be modulated by both D2 and D3receptors. For example, the study of Moratalla et al. (3Moratalla R. Xu M. Tonegawa S. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14928-14933Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) identified anatomically restricted alterations in c-fosresponses to haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug that blocks the D2-like dopamine receptor subtypes D2 and D3, and other studies on mice deficient for D3receptors revealed blunted c-fos responses to D1agonist stimulation. These responses were even further reduced when D3 mutants were pretreated with the D2-like antagonist eticlopride (4Jung M.-Y. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29406-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).To further investigate the role of D2 and D3receptors in the modulation of c-fos responses to pharmacological stimuli, the present study used mice deficient for D2 and D3 receptors to analyze their levels of forebrain c-fos mRNA expressed in response to (a) direct stimulation of D1 receptors with a full D1 agonist, (b) indirect stimulation of dopamine receptors via methamphetamine-induced dopamine release, and (c) agonist stimulation of D1 receptors 1–3 weeks after an application of either methamphetamine or the D1 agonist. This study revealed that the constitutive inactivation of D2 and D3 receptors leads to a decrease in agonist-promoted D1 receptor activity that can be reversed in a long term manner by a single dose of either methamphetamine or a D1 agonist.RESULTSA first series of experiments determined the basal, D1agonist, and methamphetamine-induced c-fos mRNA levels in the forebrains of D2 and D3 mutant mice and their wild-type littermates. Compared with wild-type mice (in which c-fos mRNA levels are undetectable), the basal c-fos mRNA levels are higher in the forebrains of both D2 and D3 mutant mice (Fig. 1 A).The induction of c-fos mRNA expression was determined 60 min after application of the full D1 agonist SKF82958 (1 mg/kg). This induction is robust in wild type, but by comparison it is drastically blunted in both D2 and D3 mutants (Fig. 1 A). A comparison of optical densities (OD) determined for equal size fields of the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 1 A(OD wild type, 6.0; D2 mutants, 0.5; D3mutants, 0.8) indicates that the c-fos responses of D2 and D3 mutants are reduced to 8.3 and 13.3%, respectively, of the corresponding wild-type level. In five independent experiments (see “Materials and Methods”), c-fos mRNA levels expressed in D2 mutants were only 12.2 ± 3.7% of the corresponding wild-type levels (p < 0.001), and c-fos mRNA levels of D3 mutants reached only 15.7 ± 9.4% of levels expressed in wild type (p < 0.001). c-fosmRNA levels expressed in D2 and D3 mutants did not differ significantly (TableI).Table IComparison of ODs of c-fos mRNA signals of SKF82958-treated drug-naive, methamphetamine (METH)- and SKF-pretreated wild type, and D2 and D3 mutant miceTreatmentBrain regionWild type ODsD2−/− ODsD3−/− ODsSKFForebrain5 ± 1.50.6 ± 0.2 1-ap < 0.001 compared with wild type.0.7 ± 0.2 1-ap < 0.001 compared with wild type.METH/SKFNeocortex2.1 ± 0.53.9 ± 1.7 1-bp < 0.01 compared to wild type.3.9 ± 1.7 1-cp < 0.05 compared with wild type.SKF/SKFNeocortex0.9 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.3 1-ap < 0.001 compared with wild type.1.3 ± 0.1b,dData were obtained from SKF-treated drug-naive animals (SKF) and from methamphetamine- or SKF-pretreated animals that received a challenge dose of SKF (METH/SKF and SKF/SKF, respectively).d p < 0.01 compared with D2 mutants.1-a p < 0.001 compared with wild type.1-b p < 0.01 compared to wild type.1-c p < 0.05 compared with wild type. Open table in a new tab Another series of experiments measured c-fos mRNA levels expressed in response to a single dose of methamphetamine (8 mg/kg). In the forebrain of wild-type mice, c-fos responses are substantially lower than corresponding responses to the D1agonist (Fig. 1 A). A comparison of optical densities on the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 1 A indicates that the magnitude of these c-fos responses (OD, 1.0) is only 16.7% of the responses detected in wild-type animals after D1 agonist application (OD, 6.0). In four independent experiments, c-fos levels expressed in methamphetamine-treated wild-type mice reached only 23.7 ± 12.0% of the corresponding levels expressed in SKF-treated wild-type mice (Student's t test,p < 0.001). c-fos mRNA levels induced with only 2 mg/kg methamphetamine also do not differ from c-fos mRNA levels induced with 8 mg/kg methamphetamine (data not shown). Moreover, in contrast to the results obtained with the D1 agonist, methamphetamine-induced c-fos responses of D2 or D3 mutant mice do not differ from wild type (Fig. 1 A). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 1 B in wild type and D2 and D3 mutants, c-fos responses to methamphetamine treatment are markedly reduced by pretreatment with the D1receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.3 mg/kg), but they are unaffected by a pretreatment with saline. These data confirm that the induction of c-fos expression by amphetamine-like drugs is dependent upon D1 receptor activation (3Moratalla R. Xu M. Tonegawa S. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14928-14933Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Additional studies compared c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation in drug-naive mice and mice that received a single dose of methamphetamine (5 mg/kg) 1, 2, or 3 weeks before SKF treatment. In wild-type animals, the c-fosresponses to D1 agonist stimulation are not significantly altered 1 and 2 weeks after methamphetamine pretreatment (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly however, as many as 2 weeks after a single dose of methamphetamine, the levels of c-fos induced in both D2 and D3 mutants are similar to the levels expressed in either drug-naive or methamphetamine-pretreated wild-type mice (Fig. 1 C). Thus, in contrast to the blunted c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation of drug-naive mutants (Fig. 1 A), methamphetamine-pretreated D2 and D3 mutants show substantially more robust c-fos responses to D1 agonists (see below). However, 3 weeks after methamphetamine administration, the blunted c-fos responses of the mutants to D1agonist stimulation are again apparent, and a comparison of the optical densities of signals on the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 1 D(OD wild type, 4.08; D2 mutants, 0.8; D3mutants, 1.0) indicates that D2 and D3 mutants express only 19.5 and 24.4% of the corresponding wild-type c-fos levels (these levels are similar to the levels determined above for SKF-treated drug-naive mutants).The results summarized above were obtained from adult mice that received the first drug injection at P60. To determine whether similar results were obtained in preadolescent mice, experiments were also performed in mice at postnatal age 30. As shown in Fig. 2 A, P30 mice express only marginally increased levels of c-fos in response to the D1 agonist (1 mg/kg), and these levels do not differ from corresponding levels induced by methamphetamine (8 mg/kg). Moreover, at these low expression levels, no significant differences are found between wild type and D2 mutants, and D3mutants express only slightly reduced levels of c-fos in response to both SKF and methamphetamine (Fig. 2 A, seelanes marked 1, 2, and 3). However, when P30 mice (both wild type and mutants) are treated with a single dose of methamphetamine (5 mg/kg) and challenged with SKF at P47, c-fos responses are robust in all genotypes, and no differences are found between wild-type and mutant mice. Furthermore, D2 single mutants that received methamphetamine at postnatal day 24 also express high levels of c-fos in response to SKF administered at P30, and the c-fos mRNA levels of these mutants do not differ from the levels expressed in mice treated with methamphetamine at P30 and challenged with SKF at P47 (Fig. 2 B). Altogether, these results indicate that a single dose of methamphetamine leads to a long term increase in c-fos responses to D1 agonist stimulation in brains with either low (preadolescent mice) or blunted (adult D2 and D3 mutant mice) c-fosexpression levels.Figure 2c-fos mRNA responses to a D1 agonist and methamphetamine in the forebrains of wild-type, D2, and D3 mutant mice at postnatal age P30. A, the c-fos mRNA levels expressed in P30 wild type (lanes 1), homozygous D2mutants (lanes 2), and homozygous D3 mutants (lanes 3) in response to SKF82958 (SKF, 1 mg/kg) and methamphetamine (METH, 8 mg/kg) are compared with c-fos mRNA levels expressed in SKF-treated D3 mutants at P60 (lane P60). B,c-fos mRNA levels of SKF-treated P30 wild-type mice (wt P30) are compared with corresponding mRNA levels expressed in wild-type (wt), homozygous D2, and homozygous D3 mutant mice that received a single injection of methamphetamine (5 mg/kg) at P30 followed by a single dose of SKF (1 mg/kg) at P47, and D2 mutants that received an equal dose of methamphetamine at P15 followed by SKF treatment at P30. For each genotype, brain tissues of four animals/genotype were pooled for RNA extraction, and 20 μg of total RNA was loaded onto eachlane. The blots shown in A and B were exposed to film for 16 and 6 h, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further determine whether the D1 agonist and methamphetamine induce different levels of c-fos in different anatomic areas of the forebrain, additional experiments compared c-fos mRNA levels in the neocortex and remaining forebrain of adult wild-type and mutant mice. These results revealed that the levels of c-fos mRNA expressed in response to a single dose of methamphetamine are higher in the forebrain neocortex compared with the inner (extraneocortical) mass of the forebrain (Fig. 3). This finding is in contrast to the D1 agonist, which induces similar levels of c-fos in the neocortex and in extraneocortical forebrain structures (Fig. 4). Moreover, in both D2 and D3 mutants that were pretreated with methamphetamine, drastically enhanced c-fos responses to SKF treatment are detected in the neocortex, but the c-fosmRNA levels in the extraneocortical forebrain remain low (Fig. 3). In fact, on the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 3, neocortical c-fos levels of D2 and D3 mutants are 3.4- and 2.1-fold higher, respectively, compared with wild-type c-fos levels (OD wild type, 1.37; D2 mutants, 4.70; D3 mutants, 2.87). By comparison, the optical densities of c-fos signals obtained from extraneocortical forebrain mRNA are 1.56, 0.5, and 0.5 for wild type, D2mutants, and D3 mutants, respectively. Thus, the methamphetamine-induced reversal of the blunted c-fosexpression of both mutants in response to D1 agonist treatment is only due to an increase in their neocortical c-fos mRNA responses. In four independent experiments (see Table I), neocortical c-fos mRNA levels of D2 mutants were 310 ± 40% of the corresponding wild-type levels, and this difference is significant (p< 0.01). Mean neocortical c-fos mRNA levels of D3 mutants were also significantly increased (229 ± 39.4% of corresponding wild-type levels, p < 0.05).Figure 3c-fos mRNA responses to methamphetamine and SFK82958 in the neocortex and extraneocortical forebrain structures of wild-type, D2, and D3 mutant mice.

As shown in Fig. 3, methamphetamine-induced c-fos responses are indistinguishable between drug-naive and methamphetamine-pretreated wild-type and mutant mice. Interestingly however, as also shown in Fig. 3, the basal levels of c-fosmRNA measured 1 week after methamphetamine administration no longer differ between wild-type and mutant mice (compare with Fig. 1 A).Another experiment tested whether pretreatment with a single dose of the D1 agonist (1 mg/kg) also affects c-fosresponses to subsequent D1 agonist stimulation. These results are shown in Fig. 4. In both neocortex and extraneocortical forebrains, c-fos induction by SKF treatment is robust in wild type and in D2 and D3 mutants that were pretreated with SKF 1 week earlier. In fact, compared with wild type, optical densities of the signals on the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 4(top right) revealed a 1.8- and 1.3-fold increase in neocortical c-fos mRNA levels expressed in D2 and D3 mutants, respectively. In four independent experiments (see Table I), neocortical c-fosmRNA levels of D2 and D3 mutants were significantly increased to 201 ± 10.2% and 151 ± 30.6%, respectively, of the corresponding wild-type levels (D2mutants/wild type, p < 0.001; D3mutants/wild type, p < 0.01; D2mutants/D3 mutants, p < 0.01).A further comparison between c-fos responses of SKF-naive and SKF-pretreated animals revealed that SKF pretreatment, similar to methamphetamine pretreatment, markedly increased c-fosresponses only in the mutants (Fig. 4, bottom). However, in contrast to methamphetamine, SKF does not significantly alter the increased basal levels of c-fos in D2 mutants. Also, D3 mutants continue to express detectable c-fos mRNA, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 4,bottom).DISCUSSIONThis study shows that compared with methamphetamine, higher c-fos mRNA levels are expressed in response to D1 agonist stimulation and that adult mice lacking either the D2 or D3 receptor show blunted c-fos responses to the D1 agonist. A single dose of methamphetamine induces a long lasting enhancement of c-fos responses in brains with either low (preadolescent wild-type and mutant mice) or blunted (adult D2 and D3 mutants) c-fos expression levels. Moreover, the enhanced c-fos responses to the D1 agonist seen in methamphetamine-pretreated adult mutants are only detected in the neocortex, a brain region in which the acute administration of methamphetamine itself induces the largest c-fos responses. Furthermore, a single dose of a full D1 agonist elicits similar long lasting enhancement of c-fos responses to subsequent D1 agonist stimulation. These data suggest that despite the unaltered expression of D1 ligand-binding sites in D2 and D3 mutants (8Baik J.-H. Picetti R. Dalardi A. Thirlet G. Dierich A. Depaulis A. Le Meur M. Borelli E. Nature. 1995; 377: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 9Xu M. Koeltzow T.E. Santiago G.T. Moratalla R. Cooper D.C. Hu X.-T. White N.M. Graybiel A.M. White F.J. Tonegawa S. Neuron. 1997; 19: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), the chronic inactivation of D2 and D3 receptors leads to a decreased responsiveness of D1 receptors to agonist stimulation, which can be reversed by a single dose of either methamphetamine or a D1 agonist.Significantly reduced c-fos protein responses to D1-agonist stimulation were previously reported (4Jung M.-Y. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29406-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for the same D3 mutants in this study. The present analysis of c-fos mRNA expression levels revealed similarly blunted c-fos responses in mice deficient for D2receptors, an effect that could only marginally be detected in the previous protein study (4Jung M.-Y. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29406-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This analysis suggests that D2but not D3 mutants develop compensatory mechanisms that operate either at the translational or posttranslational level to maintain wild-type-like c-fos protein responses to D1 agonist stimulation. The present study also found increased basal levels of c-fos mRNA in the forebrain of mice deficient for D2 and D3 receptors. This result is similar to the results of previous pharmacological studies showing increased c-fos expression levels in rats that were treated acutely or chronically with the D2/D3receptor blocker haloperidol (10Robertson G.S. Fibiger H.C. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Merchant K.M. Dobie D.J. Filloux F.M. Totke M. Aravagiri M. Dorsa D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 460-471PubMed Google Scholar).The c-fos responses to methamphetamine differ both quantitatively and qualitatively from the c-fos responses induced by the D1 agonist. In contrast to the widespread c-fos expression induced by the D1 agonist, the effects of methamphetamine are delimited to the neocortex. These effects suggest that the two types of pharmacological stimuli activate different neuronal populations/circuitries that express c-fos, and future and more detailed investigations of the anatomic distribution of c-fos mRNA expression will need to test investigation. The quantitative differences of c-fos expression levels induced by methamphetamine and D1 agonists may also reflect differences in the activation of the two principal transcriptional activators of the FOS gene, pMAP kinase and cAMP-response element-binding protein (pCREB) (12Fields R.D. Eshete F. Stevens B. Itoh K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7252-7266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In any case, a main finding of the present study is that a single dose of methamphetamine (5 mg/kg) leads to a long term (as many as 2 weeks) reversal of the blunted c-fos responses to D1agonist stimulation in the forebrain of mice deficient for D2 and D3 receptors. Interestingly, the same dose of amphetamine has previously also been shown to induce a long-lasting behavioral and neuroendocrine sensitization in rats that is accompanied by an increase in electrically evoked dopamine release in the forebrain (13Vanderschuren L.M.J. Schmidt E.D. De Vries T.J. Van Moorsel C.A.P. Tilders F.J.H. Schoffelmeer A.N.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9579-9586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as shown here one long term consequence of this dose of methamphetamine is a decrease of the (abnormally) high basal c-fos levels in D2 and D3 mutants. This consequence may perhaps be one of the mechanisms by which methamphetamine (but not the D1agonist) increases the responsiveness of neurons to subsequent D1 agonist stimulation.It will be of great interest to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the methamphetamine-induced and D1agonist-induced long term enhancement of cortical c-fosresponses to D1 agonist stimulation in brains with low or abnormally blunted c-fos responses. The decreased agonist-promoted D1 receptor activity detected in D2 and D3 mutants suggest that the chronic treatment with neuroleptic drugs that block D2 and D3 receptors (a common therapeutic intervention of schizophrenia) could impair the function of D1 receptors. Several other studies provided evidence for a reduced cortical D1 receptor activity during chronic neuroleptic treatment (14Castner S.A. Williams G.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Science. 2000; 287: 2020-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 15Williams G.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Nature. 1995; 376: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 16Okubo Y.

Nature. 1997; 385: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and results of a most recent study (14Castner S.A. Williams G.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Science. 2000; 287: 2020-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) suggested for the first time that a short term co-administration of a D1-selective agonist to monkeys chronically treated with neuroleptics can improve behavioral deficits associated with a decreased cortical D1 receptor activity. The present study now shows that the decreased response of neocortical D1receptors to agonist stimulation in mice deficient for D2and D3 receptors is not irreversible and suggests that an intermittent stimulation of dopamine release by amphetamine-like drugs during treatment with typical neuroleptics can result in a long term increase in agonist-promoted D1 receptor activity. The induction of expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos, a gene with low base-line levels of expression in brain, is a well established and powerful tool for examining neuronal circuits that are activated biochemically in response to a variety of different stimuli. For example, studies on the induction of c-fos in response to an acute administration of drugs of abuse identified a common neuroanatomical pattern of expression (for review see Ref. 1Harlan R.E. Garcia M.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 221-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the subchronic administration of such drugs (which is associated with a progressive sensitization of neuronal systems) leads to distinct alterations in the anatomic pattern of c-fos expression (2Curran E.J. Akil H. Watson S.J. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on mutant mice have demonstrated that the expression of dopamine D1 receptors is essential for the control of immediate-early gene expression by psychomotor stimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine (3Moratalla R.

Although D1 receptors are essential for the induction of c-fos expression in response to psychostimulants, the magnitude of the D1-dependent c-fos expression levels appears to be modulated by both D2 and D3receptors. For example, the study of Moratalla et al. (3Moratalla R. Xu M. Tonegawa S. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14928-14933Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) identified anatomically restricted alterations in c-fosresponses to haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug that blocks the D2-like dopamine receptor subtypes D2 and D3, and other studies on mice deficient for D3receptors revealed blunted c-fos responses to D1agonist stimulation. These responses were even further reduced when D3 mutants were pretreated with the D2-like antagonist eticlopride (4Jung M.-Y. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29406-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of D2 and D3receptors in the modulation of c-fos responses to pharmacological stimuli, the present study used mice deficient for D2 and D3 receptors to analyze their levels of forebrain c-fos mRNA expressed in response to (a) direct stimulation of D1 receptors with a full D1 agonist, (b) indirect stimulation of dopamine receptors via methamphetamine-induced dopamine release, and (c) agonist stimulation of D1 receptors 1–3 weeks after an application of either methamphetamine or the D1 agonist. This study revealed that the constitutive inactivation of D2 and D3 receptors leads to a decrease in agonist-promoted D1 receptor activity that can be reversed in a long term manner by a single dose of either methamphetamine or a D1 agonist. RESULTSA first series of experiments determined the basal, D1agonist, and methamphetamine-induced c-fos mRNA levels in the forebrains of D2 and D3 mutant mice and their wild-type littermates. Compared with wild-type mice (in which c-fos mRNA levels are undetectable), the basal c-fos mRNA levels are higher in the forebrains of both D2 and D3 mutant mice (Fig. 1 A).The induction of c-fos mRNA expression was determined 60 min after application of the full D1 agonist SKF82958 (1 mg/kg). This induction is robust in wild type, but by comparison it is drastically blunted in"

The URF is essential and sufficient for hepatocyte-specific expression, periportal localization, perinatal activation and induction by glucocorticoids, and cAMP in transgenic mice. Before birth, the transgene is silent but can be induced by cAMP and glucocorticoids, indicating that these compounds are responsible for the activation of expression at birth. A 102-bp glucocorticoid response unit within the URF, containing binding sites for HNF3, C/EBP, and the glucocorticoid receptor, is the main determinant of the hepatocyte-specific and hormone-controlled activity. Additional sequences are required for a productive interaction between this minimal response unit and the core CPS promoter. These results show that the 469-bp URF, and probably only the 102-bp glucocorticoid response unit, functions as a regulatory module, in that it autonomously executes a correct spatial, developmental and hormonal program of CPS expression in the liver.

Katz N. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 708-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 2Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H. Chamuleau R.A.F.M. Physiol.

Key enzymes of these pathways are therefore expressed in gradients along the sinusoids that connect the portal and the central vein. These zonal differences in gene expression largely avoid futile cycling of opposite metabolic processes (such as between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis) but also comprise complementary functions such as the low and high affinity detoxifying functions of the urea cycle and glutamine synthetase, respectively (1Jungermann K. Katz N. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 708-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 2Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H. Chamuleau R.A.F.M. Physiol.

Because the heterogeneous expression of genes in mammalian liver seems to relate to the function of the organ, much effort has been invested in understanding the mechanisms underlying its regulation. Nevertheless, it remains obscure what causes these differences in porto-central enzyme gradients and how critical the maintenance of these gradients is for preservation of normal liver function. For several hepatic genes it was shown that their localization within the liver is regulated at the transcriptional level (5Ramesh T.M. Ellis A.W. Spear B.T. Mol. Cell.

For that reason, we decided to embark upon a genetic dissection of the regulatory DNA elements that confer periportal expression upon a reporter gene.

This upstream regulatory fragment (URF) contains multiple recognition sites for HNF3 and C/EBP family members, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and several unknown factors. The GR recognition site is present within a 102-bp fragment, together with a C/EBP and a HNF3 site, and forms a functional response unit (20Christoffels V.M. Grange T. Kaestner K.H. Cole T.J.

Here, we present an experimental analysis of the regulatory functions of the 469-bp URF and the 0.3-kbp promoter in transient transfection assays and in transgenic mice. We found that the URF meets the criteria for being a regulatory module (21Arnone M.I. Davidson E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1851-1864PubMed Google Scholar), which autonomously executes all regulatory functions in liver that cause the typical expression pattern of the endogenous CPS gene. Within this fragment, a 102-bp subfragment comprising the GRU controls hepatocyte-specific, hormone-controlled expression in vitroand, in addition, periportal expression in vivo. Constructs 1–10 are based on a pBluescript-derived vector containing the promoterless luciferase gene (1.8-kbpHindIII/EcoRI luc+ fragment of pSPluc+ (Promega, Madison, WI)) in conjunction with the SV40 small T-antigen intron and polyadenylation signal, optimized for expression (22van den Hoff M.J.B.

Construct 8 is identical to construct 4, except that the sequences of the URF upstream of the GRU were removed. Constructs 9 and 10 are comparable with construct 7, except that they contain the minimal heat shock 70 gene promoter and the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter, respectively. The minimal heat shock 70 gene promoter was isolated as a 315-bp SmaI-HindIII fragment from pIND (Invitrogen). The minimal cytomegalovirus promoter was isolated from pCI (Promega) by generating a BamHI site at position −55 relative to the transcription start site and aNcoI site at +320 including the TATA box, transcription start side, 5′-untranslated region and chimeric intron. The various parts of the URF and promoter were generated by polymerase chain reaction. All constructs were checked by sequence analysis. The plasmids were isolated using Jetstar columns (Genomed, BadÖynhausen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Figure 1The GRU and minimal promoter of the CPS gene require additional fragments of the 469-bp URF or the CPS promoter to confer hormone inducibility upon a reporter gene.

Construct 5 was modified to contain, in addition to the 102-bp GRU and the extended CPS promoter (−161 to +138), a 0.2-kbp chimeric intron fragment from pCI (Promega), a nuclear targeted lacZ reporter gene, and the 0.3-kbp polyadenylation signal from the bovine growth hormone gene from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting transgenic line was named GRU-E.

Copy numbers of constructs integrated into the genome were determined by Southern blot analysis of 10 μg of tail tip DNA digested with PstI. To increase hepatocellular cAMP levels in adult mice, animals were starved for 48 h (27Seitz H.J. Müller M.J. Nordmeyer P. Krone W. Tarnowski W.

For prenatal cAMP treatment, fetuses of timed pregnant females were exposed by midabdominal incision and injected with 50 mg/kg body weight (1 × 10−4m) chlorothiophenyl cAMP in physiological saline. Control females were laparotomized, and the fetuses were injected with physiological saline alone. After 6 h, the livers of the fetuses were isolated for luciferase activity determination. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with dexamethasone phosphate in phosphate-buffered saline (5 mg/kg body weight) 16 h before sacrifice. For prenatal dexamethasone treatment, timed pregnant females were injected with 5 mg/kg body weight (1 × 10−5m) dexamethasone phosphate in phosphate-buffered saline. After 6 h, the livers of the fetuses were isolated for luciferase activity determination. Mice were adrenalectomized via the dorsal approach. Adrenalectomized and control animals had access to water supplemented with 0.7% (w/v) NaCl and 4% (w/v) sucrose and were sacrificed after 7 days. Animals were housed with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle, and permitted ad libitum access to water and standard pellet-type diet.

The constructs were tested in transient transfections to FTO-2B hepatoma cells, in the absence and presence of hormones. Constructs 2–4 were stimulated 4–6-fold by dexamethasone and 7–9-fold by the combination of cAMP and dexamethasone, whereas construct 1 is not stimulated (Fig. 1).

Mutation of the C/EBP, HNF3, or GR recognition site within this unit almost completely abolishes the hormonal response, showing the strict requirement of the intact GRU for such a response (20Christoffels V.M. Grange T. Kaestner K.H. Cole T.J. Darlington G.J. Croniger C.M. Lamers W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6305-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). When sites I, II, and III were removed from the promoter (construct 6), hormone-inducible luciferase levels decreased 4-fold. When, in addition, the GAG box was removed (construct 7), hormone inducibility decreased another 2-fold. The replacement of the TATA box, transcription start site and 5′-untranslated region of the CPS gene with those of the Drosophila hsp70 gene (construct 9) or the cytomegalovirus minimal promoter (construct 10) resulted for cytomegalovirus in relatively strong basal activity in the case of the cytomegalovirus promoter and for both promoters in only a slight increase in inducibility relative to construct 7. Whereas sites I–III and the GAG box are required for hormonal inducibility in construct 7, they are not in construct 4. One possibility for the loss of activity and decline in hormonal inducibility of constructs 5–7 could be the short distance between the TATA box and the GRU, causing crucial sites to be positioned at opposite sites of the DNA helix (asynchronous phasing). The other possibility could be that the HNF3 site, positioned between the GRU and the TATA box in construct 4, forms a crucial component for this construct to be active. To investigate these possibilities, construct 4 was modified by removing the part of the URF upstream of the GRU, leaving all sequences downstream of the deletion in exactly the same configuration (construct 8). The modification caused a complete loss of inducibility. This result shows that the GRU requires either promoter sequences (sites I–III and GAG box) or URF sequences upstream of the GRU to confer its hormonal response. The DNA in transient transfection assays is present in episomal particles rather than embedded in the chromatin and therefore not subject to many important components of the transcription regulation machinery (31Kadonaga J.T. Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 129-131Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J.

Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Furthermore, topological and developmental aspects of regulation are by definition not fully reconstituted in transfection assays. We therefore tested the constructs 2–4 (Fig. 1) in transgenic mice (lines E, G and T, respectively). This series should enable us to investigate 1) the regulatory potential of the URF, in conjunction with the core promoter and 2) the role of the additional sites (GAG, I, II, and III) within the immediate upstream region of the promoter in the in vivotransactivation of the gene. To investigate the organ distribution of reporter gene expression, luciferase activity was assayed in liver, small intestine, kidney, spleen, and heart of transgenic littermates of the offspring of founders (Table I). Of lines selected for further analysis, activity in colon, stomach, lung, and pancreas was determined additionally. Eight independent lines with construct E were tested, of which four showed liver-specific expression, one showed equal expression in liver and heart, and three showed no activity. Lines E4 and E5 were used for further analysis. Nine independent lines with construct G were tested, of which four showed liver-specific expression, one showed ectopic expression in the kidney, and four did not show any expression in the organs tested. One positive founder (G5) was not able to pass on the transgene and was lost. Lines G7 and G8 were used for further analysis. Eight independent lines with construct T were analyzed, of which four showed liver-specific expression, one showed expression in all organs tested, and three did not show any expression in the organs tested. Lines T1 and T2 were used for further analysis. Assuming that the transgenic lines that were investigated are a random sample of all possible integrations, our data show that the presence of the GAG box (construct G) and sites I–III (construct E) enhance expression. A similar conclusion is reached when the lines the highest specific expression (E5, G7, T2) are compared. These data therefore correspond to those obtained in vitro, albeit that the differences in vivo are much larger. In addition to organ distribution, we studied three highly characteristic features of CPS expression: selective periportal expression, hormone inducibility, and developmental appearance in the selected transgenic lines.Table IHepatocyte-specific expression of luciferase in mice containing constructs G and TCPS lineActivity in liverEctopic expression 1-aActivity in kidney, spleen, or heart.

The localization of luciferase mRNA in the different transgenic mice was analyzed with in situ hybridization and compared with that of endogenous CPS, PEPCK, another periportal enzyme, and GS, a strictly pericentral enzyme (Fig. 2).

Bioengineer. 1984; 26: 805-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have studied intensely the reaction mechanism and structure ofl-DEX YL, and revealed that the reaction begins with nucleophilic attack of Asp10 on the α-carbon atom ofl-2-haloalkanoates, causing the release of a halide ion and the formation of an ester intermediate (SchemeFS1, I), which is subsequently hydrolyzed (3Liu J.-Q.

In the x-ray structure, there is a water molecule close to Asp10, Ser175, Asn177, and Asp180, the latter three of which are supposed to enhance the nucleophilicity of the water molecule for hydrolysis of the ester intermediate (5Li Y.-F.

These enzymological studies ofl-DEX YL have provided critical information on the structures and functions of various hydrolases including P-type ATPases, which have a significant sequence similarity withl-DEX YL and are proposed to have the haloacid dehalogenase fold (6Aravind L.

Recent studies on the crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum revealed that this ATPase has a high three-dimensional structural similarity to that ofl-DEX YL and many essential amino acid residues are conserved between these two proteins (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar).Figure FS1. Reaction mechanism ofl-DEX YL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the course of the studies of l-DEX YL, we surprisingly found that replacement of the catalytic residue, Asp10, by Asn did not completely inactivate the enzyme, whereas replacement by Ala, Gly, Ser, or Glu resulted in total inactivation (11Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the activity of the D10N preparation is attributed to the post-translational production of the wild-type enzyme by deamidation of Asn10: deamidation of Asn to produce Asp has been shown to occur in a variety of proteins (12Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pries F. Kingma J. Janssen D.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the D10N enzyme itself catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanism of dehalogenation catalyzed by the l-DEX YL D10N preparation by ion-spray mass spectrometry (MS), and found that the D10N enzyme itself, in addition to the wild-type enzyme produced by deamidation of the D10N enzyme, catalyzes dehalogenation. Asn10 was shown to undergo a unique structural change in the course of the catalysis: it is converted into a β-cyanoalanine (β-CNAla) residue via an imidate, and then regenerated in the catalytic cycle. This is the first report of the formation of a β-CNAla residue as an enzyme reaction intermediate. Also, the results demonstrate the validity of mass spectrometry in enzyme dynamics. Lysyl endopeptidase of Acromobacter lyticus M497-1 (Lys-C) and phenylisothiocyanate were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan),l-2-chloropropionic acid (l-CPA),l-Asn, l-Asp, and dl-Ala from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), β-CNAla from Sigma, and H218O (94–97%) from Isotec (Dayton, OH). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Replacement of amino acid residue(s) was carried out by the method of Kunkel et al. (14Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Mutant genes for D10N and D180N were constructed as reported previously (11Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The synthetic mutagenic primer designed for the D10N/L11K double mutant was as follows (the underlines indicate the mutagenized nucleotides): 5′-CAGCGTACCGTACTTGTTGAAGGCAATACC. The substitutions were confirmed with a Shimadzu PPSQ-10 protein sequencer (Kyoto, Japan), an Applied Biosystem 373A DNA sequencer (Foster City, CA), and an ion-spray mass spectrometer PE-Sciex API 300 (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Mutant enzymes were produced inEscherichia coli JM109. All operations were performed at 4 °C, and 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) was used as the standard buffer unless otherwise stated. The recombinant E. coli cells producing the enzyme were grown aerobically at 37 °C for 14 h in LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The cells harvested from a 4-liter culture were disrupted by sonication. The supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. A fraction of 40–70% saturation was dissolved in the standard buffer, and then applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650 column (3 × 25 cm) (TOSOH, Tokyo). The column was washed with 500 ml of the buffer supplemented with 30% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 30−20% ammonium sulfate in the buffer with a total volume of 1 liter. The fractions containing the mutant enzyme were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), and applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column (1.7 × 5 cm) (TOSOH, Tokyo) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 10−50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with a total volume of 200 ml. The fractions containing the mutant enzyme were pooled and used as a purified preparation of the mutant enzyme. l-DEX YL was routinely assayed by determination of chloride ions produced from l-CPA by the method of Iwasaki et al. (15Iwasaki I. Utsumi S. Hagino K. Ozawa T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1956; 29: 860-864Crossref Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture (100 μl) contained 2.5 μmol of l-CPA, 10 μmol of Tris sulfate buffer (pH 9.5), and the enzyme. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of 1.5 m sulfuric acid after incubation at 30 °C for 10 min. One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes dehalogenation of 1 μmol ofl-CPA per min. Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Hercules, CA). Wild-typel-DEX YL, the D10N mutant enzyme, the D10N/L11K double mutant enzyme, or the D10N/D180N double mutant enzyme (10 nmol each) was incubated with l-CPA in the standard assay mixture. The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 20% (v/v) formic acid, followed by centrifugation at 8200 × g for 1 min. The enzyme was deionized with Jasco HPLC system (Tokyo) with a C18 reverse phase column (Shiseido Capcell Pak, SG 300 Å 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Tokyo) at room temperature, employing linear gradients of solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid): sample injection; 3 min, 20% B; 12 min, 20−100% B; 3 min, 100% B; 2 min, 100−20% B (flow rate: 1 ml/min). The deionized enzyme was lyophilized, dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.05% formic acid, and introduced into the mass spectrometer, PE-Sciex API 300 or API 365 at a flow rate of 2.5 μl/min. The quadrupole was scanned from 300−800 to 2,000 atomic mass units with a step size of 0.1−0.2 atomic mass unit and with a dwell time of 0.2–1 ms/step. The orifice potential was set at 30−60 V. The molecular mass was calculated using the Bio-MultiView software supplied by PE-Sciex. The D10N/L11K mutant enzyme incubated and deionized as described above was lyophilized, dissolved in 50 μl of 8m urea in 200 mm Tris sulfate buffer (pH 7.2), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzyme was then digested by addition of 82.5 pmol of Lys-C dissolved in 75 μl of 1 mTris sulfate buffer (pH 9.0) at 37 °C for 12 h. The proteolysates (95–100 μl) were loaded onto the C18Shiseido Capcell Pak column connected to the mass spectrometer, PE-Sciex API 300 or API 3000. Elution was carried out with 2% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient of 2−82% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid over 40 min at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The quadrupole was scanned from 150−200 to 1,000 with a step size of 0.2 and with a dwell time of 0.5 ms/step. The orifice potential was set at 50 V. For detailed analysis of the peptides containing Asn10, the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractions were collected, concentrated, and injected into the mass spectrometer for tandem MS/MS analysis described below. The daughter ion spectra were obtained in the triple-quadrupole daughter ion scan mode by introducing the peptides containing Asn10 from Q1 into a collision cell (Q2) and observing the daughter ions in Q3. Q1 was locked on m/z631.4, 649.5, 653.3, 655.3, 722.6, or 724.5. Q3 was scanned from 10–120 to 700–1,000 with a step size of 0.1 and with a dwell time of 0.5–1.0 ms/step. The orifice potential was set at 40–68 V. The D10N/L11K mutant enzyme (10 nmol) in 17 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was lyophilized. The lyophilized enzyme was dissolved in 40 μl of H218O containing 2.5 μmol ofl-CPA and 10 μmol of Tris sulfate (pH 9.5), and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by lyophilization. The lyophilized enzyme was denatured with 20 μl of 8 murea dissolved in 200 mm Tris sulfate buffer (pH 7.2) prepared with H218O, and digested with Lys-C dissolved in 20 μl of 1 m Tris sulfate buffer (pH 9.0) prepared with H218O at 37 °C for 15 h. Manual Edman degradation of authentic amino acids was carried out (16Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Theory and Practice on Enzymes and Other Proteins. 2nd Ed. Nankodo, Tokyo, Japan1995: 467-474Google Scholar, 17Tarr G.E. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 335-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Authentic Ala (1.2 mg), Asn (2.6 mg), Asp (1.6 mg), and β-CNAla (1.7 mg) were separately dissolved in 200 μl of 60% pyridine containing 1.5% dimethylallylamine, mixed with 20 μl of phenylisothiocyanate, and incubated anaerobically at 45 °C for 40 min. Remaining phenylisothiocyanate was removed with benzene, and the resultant phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives were lyophilized. The lyophilized samples were mixed with 20 μl of trifluoroacetic acid and incubated anaerobically at 45 °C for 15 min. The resultant 2-anilino-5-thiazolinone derivatives were extracted with ethyl acetate, dried, and converted to the phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivatives by incubating with 1 n hydrochloric acid at 80 °C for 8 min. The PTH-derivatives were extracted with ethyl acetate, dried, and used for identification and quantification. The dried PTH-derivatives were dissolved in 40% acetonitrile containing 10 mm acetic acid, and loaded onto a reverse phase column for separation of PTH-derivatives (Wakopak WS-PTH column, 4.6 × 250 mm) connected to the mass spectrometer, PE-Sciex API 365. Elution was carried out with 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 45 μl/min. The total ion current chromatogram was recorded in the single-quadrupole mode. The quadrupole was scanned from 200 to 1,000 with a step size of 0.1 and with a dwell time of 0.5 ms/step. The ion-spray voltage was set at 5 kV, and the orifice potential was 50 V. We found that structural changes of l-DEX YL in the course of the catalytic reaction can be monitored by MS. The mass spectral change of the enzyme upon incubation with the substrate l-CPA is shown in Fig. 1. The control enzyme not incubated with l-CPA showed a peak at 26,182 Da (M), which is virtually identical to the value predicted from the nucleotide sequence (26,179 Da): an error of ± 3 Da is acceptable in the analysis of a protein around 26 kDa with the mass spectrometer used. After 4 s of incubation, the original peak almost disappeared, and a new peak appeared at 26,255 Da (M + 73), which is considered to be an ester intermediate (M + 72) (Scheme FS1, I, R = CH3). The difference between the measured increment (+73) and the estimated one (+72) can be attributed to a measurement error. The accumulation of the ester intermediate indicates that the rate of the ester formation is faster than that of the ester degradation. The original peak (M) increased over a period of 4–20 s and eventually became predominant, while the M + 73 peak decreased and disappeared. This result indicates that most of the substrates had been degraded before this time by the enzyme reaction, and the rate of formation of the ester intermediate thus became slower than the rate of degradation of the intermediate. We found that the D10N preparation showed slight dehalogenation activity (relative specific activity, about 1% of that of the wild-type enzyme when determined immediately after purification). The activity increased in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. The D10N preparation showed 3.6 and 6.2% of the wild-type enzyme activity after storage at 4 °C for 2 and 3 months, respectively; when stored at room temperature for about a month, it showed 26% activity of the wild-type enzyme activity. Amino acid sequencing of the D10N preparation showing 26% of the wild-type enzyme activity revealed the occurrence of Asp at the position of Asn10 (data not shown). These results indicate that the side chain amide of Asn10 is slowly deamidated to produce carboxylate. Although the D10N preparation contained the wild-type enzyme produced by the deamidation of Asn10as described above, its amount in the fresh preparation is considered to be at most 1% of the total enzyme judging from the specific activity of the preparation. Thus it is possible to monitor the structural change of D10N itself by MS, because the small amount of the wild-type enzyme does not interfere with the mass spectra of D10N, which is present abundantly. We determined the molecular masses of D10N incubated with l-CPA for the indicated periods shown in Fig. 2. The control enzyme not incubated with l-CPA showed a peak at 26,180 Da (M), which is virtually identical to the predicted value, 26,178 Da. After 10 s of the incubation, the original peak disappeared, and new peaks appeared at 26,253 Da (M + 73) and 26,162 Da (M − 18). As the relative abundance of the M + 73 species decreased, the M − 18 species increased over a period from 10 s to 1 min. The enzyme occurred predominantly as the M − 18 variant from 20 s to 40 min. The original peak (M) reappeared and increased over a period of 30–60 min, and became predominant by 60 min. When monochloroacetate instead of l-CPA was used as a substrate, a species showing a 60-Da increase was observed instead of the M + 73 species (data not shown), indicating that a covalently linked enzyme-substrate intermediate is produced in the course of the reaction. Two probable mechanisms can be proposed for the structural change of D10N (Schemes FS2 andFS3). The first one is shown in Scheme FS2: Asn10 attacks l-CPA to form an asparagine β-imidate 1-carboxyethyl ester (II, M + 72), and a proton andd-lactic acid are eliminated from the imidate to produce a nitrile (III, M − 18), which is subsequently hydrolyzed to reproduce Asn10 (M). The difference between the measured (+73) and estimated (+72) mass increments can be attributed to a measurement error or to the conversion of the imidate to an aspartate 1-carboxyethyl ester as shown in Scheme FS4(V, M + 73) upon denaturation of the enzyme with formic acid (18Tennant G. Comprehensive Organic Chemistry. 2. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK1979: 490-495Google Scholar) (discussed below). In the second probable mechanism shown in Scheme FS3, the imidate intermediate is produced in the same manner as shown in Scheme FS2, followed by formation of an intramolecular cross-link (IV, M − 18) caused by nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of an amino acid residue positioned in the vicinity of the imidate. The x-ray crystallographic analysis indicates that Ser175, Ser176, and Thr14 possibly play this role (5Li Y.-F. Hata Y. Fujii T. Hisano T. Nishihara M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. J. Biol.

Sequencing analysis of the M + 73 variant gave the following result: Met-Asp-Tyr-Ile-Lys-Gly-Ile-Ala-Phe-X-Leu, in whichX is an amino acid residue whose retention time is different from that of every common amino acid residue including Asn, indicating that Asn10 is modified in the M + 73 variant. Leu11 of the D10N enzyme was replaced by Lys to create D10N/L11K as described under “Experimental Procedures,” which was used to examine the modification of Asn10 by MS: Lys-C treatment of D10N/L11K produces a short peptide fragment containing Asn10, which is small enough for determination of molecular mass accurately. The mass spectrum of D10N/L11K showed a peak at 26,195 Da (M′), which is virtually identical to the predicted value, 26,193 Da. It was confirmed that the M′ + 73 (26,268 Da) and the M′ − 18 (26,177 Da) variants were formed when D10N/L11K was incubated withl-CPA for 10 s and 8 min, respectively (data not shown). Thus the Lys residue introduced next to the C-terminal side of Asn10 has little effect on the reactivity of the enzyme. D10N/L11K incubated with (or without) l-CPA was digested with Lys-C, and the resultant peptides were analyzed by LC/MS. Mass spectrum of a peptide derived from native D10N/L11K showed a peak at m/z 649.5, which was assigned as a positive monovalent ion of the hexapeptide Gly6-Lys11(Fig. 3 A, M′). The hexapeptide isolated from the enzyme incubated with l-CPA for 10 s and denatured with acid showed a new peak at m/z 722.6, which is about 73 Da higher than that derived from the unmodified one (Fig. 3B, M′ + 73). To determine the amino acid residue where the mass increment had occurred, tandem MS/MS analysis of the M′ + 73 peptide was carried out. The product ions produced from the unmodified and the M′ + 73 peptides are shown in Figs. 4,A and B, respectively. The Y series ions atm/z 649.3, 479.0, 408.1, and 261.2 derived from the unmodified peptide were assigned as Gly-Ile-Ala-Phe-Asn-Lys, Ala-Phe-Asn-Lys, Phe-Asn-Lys, and Asn-Lys, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The ions produced from the M′ + 73 peptide atm/z 722.6, 552.5, 481.2, and 334.4 were about 73 Da higher than the corresponding ions derived from the unmodified one, respectively (Fig. 4 B). However, the molecular mass of the fragment ion for the C-terminal Lys derived from the M′ + 73 peptide (m/z 147.1) was virtually identical to that from the unmodified one (m/z 147.0). This result indicates that the modification causing the 73-Da increase occurred at Asn10.Figure 4Tandem MS/MS product ion spectra of the unmodified and modified hexapeptides 6–11.

C, the M′ − 18 peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because a 1-Da difference is significant in the mass range shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the exact mass increase in the M′ + 73 peptide at Asn10 is 73 Da, not 72 Da. This indicates the presence of the ester, not the imidate, in the peptide. However, this result does not exclude the possibility that an imidate intermediate was actually produced in the reaction, because an imidate is readily hydrolyzed to an ester under a low-pH condition (18Tennant G. Comprehensive Organic Chemistry. 2. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK1979: 490-495Google Scholar) (Scheme FS4), which was employed in the present experiment to terminate the enzyme reaction. An18O atom is expected to be incorporated in the ester intermediate by addition of H218O upon acidification, if the presumed imidate intermediate is indeed hydrolyzed spontaneously by acidification. To examine if the observed ester was produced from the imidate, H218O was added to the reaction mixture at the termination of incubation. The mass spectrum showed a new peak at m/z 724.5 (Fig. 3 C, M′ + 75), indicating that an oxygen atom of a water molecule was introduced into the hexapeptide 6–11. Tandem MS/MS analysis of the M′ + 75 peptide revealed that a 2-Da mass increase occurred at Asn10 (data not shown). No M′ + 75 peptide was produced when H218O was added to the reaction mixture at 1 min after the termination of the reaction (data not shown), indicating that there is no exchange of an 18O atom of H218O with a carbonyl oxygen of the ester bond. These results show that the oxygen atom of a water molecule was incorporated into the peptide at the position corresponding to Asn10 upon denaturation with acid, supporting the view that the actual reaction intermediate is not the ester but the imidate. We carried out the Edman reaction with free β-CNAla as a substrate, and analyzed the product by MS. It was revealed that the Edman reaction gave PTH-Asn as the most predominant product (data not shown). A nitrile structure undergoes acid-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of water to produce an amide (19Sykes P. A Guidebook to Mechanism in Organic Chemistry. 6th Ed. Longman Scientific & Technical, Essex, UK1986: 244-245Google Scholar). Edman reaction employs strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid and hydrochloric acid in the reaction cycle. Therefore the nitrile structure of β-CNAla is converted to an amide in the course of the reaction. Thus, even if a β-CNAla residue is formed in a peptide, it is converted to PTH-Asn during Edman degradation. We carried out amino acid sequencing of the M − 18 variant of D10N. It gave the following sequence: Met-Asp-Tyr-Ile-Lys-Gly-Ile-Ala-Phe-Asn-Leu. Although this result may indicate that Asn10 is intact in the M − 18 variant, it is also consistent with the mechanism of β-CNAla formation at residue number 10 followed by hydrolysis during Edman degradation. To confirm the β-CNAla formation, the M′ − 18 variant of D10N/L11K was digested, and the resultant peptides were analyzed by LC/MS. We obtained a peptide with an m/z value of 631.5 (Fig. 3 D, M′ − 18), and found by tandem MS/MS analysis that Asn10 was specifically modified in such a way as its molecular mass becomes 18 Da lower than the original value (Fig. 4,A and C). Accordingly, the most probable structure formed at residue number 10 in the M − 18 (or M′ − 18) variant is a β-CNAla residue. Since nitrile can hardly be produced from the cross-link structure in the process of MS analysis, the mechanism shown in Scheme FS3 is excluded. To examine if the final step of the reaction is the reconversion of β-CNAla into Asn as shown in Scheme FS2, D10N/L11K was incubated in H218O in the presence (or absence) ofl-CPA for 60 min. If β-CNAla is reconverted to Asn as shown in Scheme FS2, an 18O atom is expected to be incorporated in the side chain amide of Asn10 when the mutant enzyme is incubated with the substrate in H218O. After incubation, D10N/L11K was denatured and digested with Lys-C. Since the C-terminal carboxyl group produced by proteolysis contains two 18O atoms when the proteolysis is performed in H218O (20Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Park C. Miyagi M. Tsunasawa S. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20977-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the peptide 6–11 reconverted from the M′ − 18 peptide in H218O is expected to contain three18O atoms, two of which are in the carboxyl group of C-terminal Lys and the rest of which is in the side chain amido group of Asn10. The hexapeptide isolated from D10N/L11K incubated without l-CPA and digested in H218O showed a new peak at m/z 653.4, which is about 4 Da higher than that derived from the unmodified one (Fig. 3 E, M′ + 4). When D10N/L11K was incubated in the presence ofl-CPA, the mass spectrum showed a new peak atm/z 655.5, which is 6 Da higher than that derived from the unmodified one (Fig. 3 F, M′ + 6). We found by tandem MS/MS analysis that two 18O atoms were incorporated in the C-terminal Lys in both the M′ + 4 and M′ + 6 peptides, and that an18O atom was incorporated in Asn10 specifically in the M′ + 6 peptide (data not shown). These results indicate that the nitrile undergoes the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to produce the side chain amide of Asn10. In conclusion, the unique structural change of D10N occurs through the mechanism shown in Scheme FS2: Asn10 attacks the substrate to form the imidate, and a proton and d-lactic acid are eliminated to produce the nitrile. This is the first report showing that Asn functions as a catalytic nucleophile in enzymatic hydrolysis where β-cyanoalanine residue is produced as a reaction intermediate. Also, the results demonstrate that mass spectrometry is remarkably useful in monitoring enzyme reactions. In the x-ray structure of the l-DEX YL S175A mutant enzyme complexed with various l-2-chloroalkanoates, the carboxyl oxygens of the substrate are hydrogen bonded to the Ser118hydroxyl group and the main chain amido nitrogens of Leu11, Tyr12, and Asn119 (5Li Y.-F. Hata Y. Fujii T. Hisano T. Nishihara M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15035-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic pocket, which is mainly composed of side chains of Tyr12, Gln42, Leu45, Phe60, Lys151, Asn177, and Trp179, exists around the alkyl group of the substrate. This pocket possibly plays an important role in stabilizing the alkyl group of the substrate through hydrophobic interactions, and also plays a role in determining the stereospecificity of the enzyme. The guanidino group of Arg41 most likely serves as the halogen abstraction site (5Li Y.-F. Hata Y. Fujii T. Hisano T. Nishihara M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15035-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because none of these amino acid residues were changed in the D10N enzyme, the position of the substrate in the active site of D10N is probably the same as that in the active site of wild-typel-DEX YL. The orientation of the amido oxygen of Asn10 is probably similar to that of the carboxyl oxygen of Asp10 participating in the ester formation in the wild-type enzyme reaction: it points to the α-carbon atom of the substrate, whose electrophilicity is probably enhanced by Arg41. Thus the side chain amide of Asn10 can attack the substrate to form the imidate in the D10N reaction in the same manner as the side chain carboxylate of Asp10 does to form the ester intermediate in the wild-type enzyme reaction. d-Lactic acid is released from the ester intermediate by hydrolysis in the wild-type enzyme reaction. In contrast, in the D10N enzyme reaction, α,β-elimination of d-lactic acid and a proton occurred, rather than hydrolysis, as shown in Scheme FS2, even though a water molecule to be used for nitrile hydrolysis is probably present in the vicinity of the imidate. Why does the imidate undergo α,β-elimination instead of hydrolysis in the D10N enzyme reaction? There are two possible reasons. The first one is that the electrophilicity of the imido carbon of the imidate is lower than that of the carbonyl carbon of the ester: the nitrogen atom of the imidate is less electronegative than the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, making the imido carbon of the imidate less electrophilic. Accordingly, imido carbon is less reactive with the nucleophilic water molecule. The second reason is the presence of a base that abstracts the imidate proton to trigger the α,β-elimination of the imidate. This base is supposed to be Asp180, which, in the wild-type enzyme, is suggested to function as a base to activate a water molecule for hydrolysis of the ester intermediate. This speculation is supported by the following observation: the mass spectrum of D10N/D180N incubated with l-CPA for 8 min showed two peaks at 26,177 Da (M"") and 26,251 Da (M"" + 74), but no peak was observed at M"" − 18 (data not shown). The incubation time (8 min) is long enough for D10N to accumulate as the M − 18 variant. This result suggests that D10N/D180N can form an imidate intermediate, but not a nitrile intermediate, supporting the view that Asp180 plays a role in the α,β-elimination of the imidate. Once the nitrile intermediate is produced, the proton abstracted from the imidate by Asp180 is probably transferred to the nitrile nitrogen to enhance the electrophilicity of the nitrile carbon and make Asp180 competent to function as a base to activate the water molecule remaining in the vicinity of the nitrile. The activated water molecule is supposed to attack the nitrile carbon to produce an amide. Formation of free β-CNAla catalyzed by β-cyanoalanine synthase (EC4.4.1.9) has been demonstrated in a wide range of organisms including higher plants (21Akopyan T.N. Braunstein A.E. Goryachenkova E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1617-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Maruyama A. Ishizawa K. Takagi T. Esashi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and several species of bacteria (23Dunnill P.M. Fowden L. Nature. 1965; 208: 1206-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Castric P.A. Conn E.E. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 132-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of free β-CNAla synthesis is quite different from that of the β-CNAla residue formation reported here: free β-CNAla is synthesized by β-replacement of the mercapto group in cysteine by cyanide (25Tolosa E.A. Maslova R.N. Goryachenkova E.V. Willhardt I.H. Braunstein A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), whereas the β-CNAla residue is formed by α,β-elimination of the imidate as shown in Scheme FS2. Roy et al. (26Roy U. Gazis D. Dal Pan G. Schwartz I.L. Roy J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983; 22: 525-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have reported that replacement of the side chain amide of Asn5 of oxytocin by a nitrile produced an analog with very weak activity, whereas a similar substitution in glycinamide 9 produced a highly active analog. Thus replacement of Asn with a β-CNAla residue can alter the functions of a protein. We reported here that the side chain amide of Asn can be converted to a nitrile. These results raise the possibility that an Asn residue is post-translationally converted into a β-CNAla residuein vivo to modify the function of proteins. Although there has been no other report on a naturally produced β-CNAla residue in a protein so far, the presence of a β-CNAla residue has perhaps been unrecognized because of the lack of an appropriate analysis method for amino acid residues constituting proteins: Edman degradation, the most widely used method for amino acid sequencing, results in the conversion of the β-CNAla residue into PTH-Asn, thereby making it impossible to distinguish a β-CNAla residue from an Asn residue. MS analysis of proteins may reveal the presence of a β-CNAla residue in other proteins. We thank J. Hiratake and M. Inoue, Kyoto University, for discussion."

Many linear genomes that replicate from their ends use a protein, the so-called terminal protein (TP),1 as a primer by forming a phosphodiester linkage between the OH group of an amino acid residue and the 5′-terminal nucleotide. Such TP-containing genomes have been found in bacteriophages (e.g. Ø29, PRD-1, Cp-1), eukaryotic viruses (e.g. adenoviruses), linear plasmids (e.g. S1, pGKL1), and bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces), and most of them have inverted terminal repeats (ITR) with sizes ranging from 6 bp, like Bacillus subtilis phage Ø29, to more than 1 kilobase, as is the case of some fungi plasmids (reviewed in Ref. 2Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 37-71Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar).The first stage in DNA replication is the recognition of the replication origins by initiator proteins (reviewed in Refs. 3Messer W.

These proteins recognize specific DNA sequence elements and direct the recruitment of the replication machinery to the site of initial DNA synthesis (6Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the case of the extensively studied protein-primed replicon of bacteriophage Ø29, the parental TP is an active component of the replication origins located at both genome ends that contain the ITR 5′-AAAGTA, specifically recognized by the replication machinery formed by the primer TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer (7Illana B.

However, TP-free Ø29 DNA terminal fragments retain about 10–15% of the template activity of TP-containing fragments (8González-Huici V. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Biol.

Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By deletion analysis of TP-free DNA fragments containing Ø29 terminal sequences, it was proposed that the minimal origins of replication are comprised within the terminal 12 bp, either from the right or left DNA ends (11Gutiérrez J. Garmendia C. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5895-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli phage PRD1 also has a linear genome that replicates by a protein-priming mechanism. It has been reported that, using TP-free fragments as templates, the terminal 20 bp of the 110-bp-long ITR are required for efficient in vitro DNA replication (12Yoo S-K. Ito J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The existence of a precise DNA sequence, required for efficient template recognition, has been also proposed for bacteriophage Cp-1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similarly, the terminal 18 bp of adenovirus genome represents the minimal replication origin and contains a 10-bp region (positions 9–18), conserved in all human adenoviruses, that is specifically recognized by the DNA polymerase complexed with the preterminal protein (Ø29 TP counterpart) (14Temperley S.M. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Using single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, it was demonstrated that the 3′ second nucleotide, with no significant sequence specificity, directs the incorporation of the complementary dNTP into the primer TP to form the initiation complex TP-dNMP (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Full-length Ø29 DNA replication requires the pairing of the initiator nucleotide to the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the template. This mechanism, named sliding-back, needs a terminal repetition of 2 bp and provides a mechanism to prevent mutations at the Ø29 DNA ends (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), since the 3′ exonuclease activity of Ø29 DNA polymerase cannot proofread the TP-linked nucleotide (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In other protein-primed linear genomes, similar situations have been described; thus, in the case of Ø29-related bacteriophage GA-1 (5′-AAA), initiation also occurs at the 3′ second nucleotide of the template and, to a lesser extent, at the third nucleotide (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).S. pneumoniae phage Cp-1 initiates at the 3′ third nucleotide of its terminal repetition (5′-AAA) (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and E. coli phage PRD1 initiates at the fourth nucleotide (5′-GGGG) (18Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as adenoviruses, with a 5′-CATCAT reiteration (19King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The sliding-back mechanism of elongation seems to be a common feature of protein-priming systems to restore full-length DNA. In the case of phage GA-1, the residual initiation directed by the third nucleotide is proposed to jump-back pairing to the first nucleotide (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, for phages Cp-1 and PRD1, initiating, respectively, at the third and fourth nucleotide, a stepwise sliding-back mechanism that recovers the preceding nucleotides sequentially, is favored (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Adenovirus initiation complex elongates from the fourth to the sixth position, and then the TP-CAT is aligned with the three terminal bases of the template by a jumping-back mechanism (19King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In this work we have further characterized the minimal sequence at the replication origin of Ø29 DNA required for an efficient initiation and elongation. We have found that conservation of the terminal repetition 5′-AA is necessary for the optimal formation of the initiation complex TP-dNMP. In particular, the 3′-terminal nucleotide, which is not used as template, modulates the initiation efficiency, impairing that of mutated templates. This checkpoint would provide a mechanism to preserve the nucleotide sequence of the genome ends.DISCUSSIONPhage Ø29 DNA replication origins are located at both ends of its linear double-stranded genome and are characterized by the presence of a TP covalently linked to each 5′ end (1Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). Although TP plays a crucial role in the origin recognition by the replication machinery, TP-free Ø29 DNA terminal fragments retain about 10–15% of their template activity in protein-primed initiation of replication (8González-Huici V.

Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis suggested a minimal origin of replication within the terminal 12 bp at each end; however, point mutations at the conserved positions did not affect their template activity except those at the second and third terminal positions, in which they were completely abolished when dATP was used as initiator nucleotide (11Gutiérrez J. Garmendia C. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5895-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results became clear when, by using single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, it was found that initiation of replication is directed by the second instead of the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the template (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The selection of the template initiation site is determined by the DNA polymerase-TP complex rather than the nucleotide sequence. Thus, the same Ø29 template is initiated at the third 3′-terminal position by the phage Cp-1 complex (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and at the second position by the Ø29 complex (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).We have further studied the role of the terminal nucleotide sequence in the efficiency of the initiation of replication by using TP-free double-stranded DNA fragments and a more active in vitrosystem in which Mn2+ is used as metal activator. The results obtained with fragments sharing a variable number of terminal bp with Ø29 ori L showed that the terminal repetition 5′-AA is the only requirement for an efficient initiation complex formation, ruling out a specific sequence recognition by the replication machinery. Our finding that a fragment that had the second, but not the first, terminal nucleotide conserved (fragment L1*, see Fig. 2) did not initiate replication, suggested a role for the 3′-terminal nucleotide. Furthermore, ori L CAA, ori L GAA, and ori L TAA showed reduced initiation activities (Fig. 4). We have ruled out the possibility that the first position is used as template for the formation of the initiation complex, since there is no specific incorporation of the dNMP complementary to the first position of mutated ori Ls (Fig. 3). There is no requirement for a mere terminal repetition of two nucleotides, as indicated by the activity ofori L CCA (7%), ori L GGA (22%), and ori L TTA (47%); these results cannot be explained on the different intrinsic affinity of Ø29 DNA polymerase for each dNTP in the initiation reaction, measured in the absence of template: 170% for dTTP, 63% for dGTP, and 22% for dCTP (100% for dATP) (25Blanco L. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1225-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether our results indicate that the 3′-terminal nucleotide, although not used as template, strongly influences the initiation complex formation directed by the second terminal nucleotide. The highest activity is obtained with a 3′-terminal T, regardless the nature of the initiator nucleotide; thus, ori L ACA was 2.4-fold more active than ori L CCA (not shown). Single mutations at the 3′ end increase the Km for dATP in the initiation event from 3 μm for the wild-typeori L to 10–28 μm for the mutants (not shown), with a Km value of 0.2 μm for TP-DNA (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′-terminal T of the template together with the 5′-linked parental TP increase the affinity of DNA polymerase for the initiator nucleotide, which is selected by the second position of template.A similar result was observed with single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, in which 3′-CTT showed a 30% initiation efficiency of the wild-type 3′-TTT (26Méndez J. Blanco L. Salas M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In other protein-primed replication systems such as S. pneumoniae phage Cp-1, in which the TP-linked nucleotide is selected by the third template nucleotide, a T to C mutation at the 3′-terminal position drops the initiation efficiency to 34% and below 1%, when the mutation is at the second position (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In E. coli phage PRD1, the initiation site is at the fourth template nucleotide; single-stranded oligonucleotides 3′-CTCC and 3′-CCTC show 11 and 52% wild-type 3′-CCCC initiation activity (18Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The fact that mutations of the nucleotides preceding the initiation site result in decreased initiation of replication is probably related to a structural requirement of the DNA polymerase active site, either to stabilize the initiator nucleotide and/or to form the covalent bond with TP. The conformation of the active site determines the efficiency of DNA polymerase to incorporate the correct nucleotide on the basis of steric (geometrical and electrostatic) constrictions rather than on the mere facility to form hydrogen bonds (27Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10506-10511Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 28Goodman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the initiation impairment of templates mutated at the 3′-terminal position could be to preserve the Ø29 genome ends, as Ø29 DNA polymerase cannot proofread the 5′-terminal nucleotide (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this would be an additional mechanism to that described for the sliding back, required for elongation of the initiation complex (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).In addition, there is a significant initiation directed by the 3′ third nucleotide of the template, as shown by the experiments with the single mutants ori L AAC, ori L AAG, and ori L AAT (Fig. 6). A residual initiation at the third position had been detected in some cases in single-stranded oligonucleotides with Ø29 (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and at a higher level with the related phage GA-1 (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We cannot measure independently the initiation directed by the second and third positions in wild-type ori L. However, the initiation activity with dATP of ori L AAC, ori L AAG, andori L AAT is lower than that of wild-type ori Land depends on the nature of the third 3′ nucleotide. Therefore, the initiation directed by the second 3′-terminal nucleotide is not only influenced by the first but also, to a lesser extent, by the third nucleotide, as the activity of the mutants at the third position is higher than that of the mutants at the first position (see Figs. 4 and7), even though the latter can use the second and third positions as template.It has been described that full-length elongation is achieved by a sliding-back mechanism from the second to the first template positions (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have also used point mutations of ori L fragments to study the template requirements for truncated elongation. As it was described previously for single-stranded templates (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), full-length elongation takes place with templates with a terminal repetition of two nucleotides (Fig. 8 A) to an extent similar to that of the wild-type ori L. This is also true when the terminal repetition is not 5′-AA. However, elongation is strongly impaired when the sliding back is prevented, as is the case of first position-mutatedori Ls (Fig. 8 B). The low initiation rate of these mutants does not fully account for their poor elongation. In these cases the elongation products are one nucleotide shorter, ruling out a mismatched sliding back. The residual elongation could be due to an initiation at the third position followed by a sliding back to the second position and/or to an initiation at the second position followed by elongation with no sliding back. The latter possibility was demonstrated with mutants in which any sliding back is prevented, such as ori L TAT and ori L AGA, which again give rise to elongation products one nucleotide shorter than full-length. In contrast, ori L ATA produced a full-length elongate, suggesting that initiation at the third position (3–5-fold higher than that of ori L TAT and ori L AGA) is followed by a jump back to the first position. A similar jumping-back mechanism has been suggested for Ø29-related phage GA-1 (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In adenovirus, initiation occurs at the 3′ fourth position, and elongation proceeds to the sixth, then by jumping back, aligns the trinucleotide to the three 3′-terminal positions (19King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have determined the sequence requirements for efficient replication of Ø29 DNA at the stages of initiation and elongation. In addition to the 3′ second T at the 3′ end, the third T is also used as template for TP-dAMP synthesis. More interestingly, the 3′-terminal T, although not used as template, is required for efficient initiation, providing a mechanism to prevent mutations at the Ø29 genome ends. DNA replication requires a primer to provide the hydroxyl group that all DNA polymerases need to initiate DNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). Many linear genomes that replicate from their ends use a protein, the so-called terminal protein (TP),1 as a primer by forming a phosphodiester linkage between the OH group of an amino acid residue and the 5′-terminal nucleotide. Such TP-containing genomes have been found in bacteriophages (e.g. Ø29, PRD-1, Cp-1), eukaryotic viruses (e.g. adenoviruses), linear plasmids (e.g. S1, pGKL1), and bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces), and most of them have inverted terminal repeats (ITR) with sizes ranging from 6 bp, like Bacillus subtilis phage Ø29, to more than 1 kilobase, as is the case of some fungi plasmids (reviewed in Ref. 2Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 37-71Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The first stage in DNA replication is the recognition of the replication origins by initiator proteins (reviewed in Refs. 3Messer W. Weigel C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1579-1601Google Scholar, 4Donaldson A.D. Blow J.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Ritzi M. Knippers R. Gene. 2000; 245: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These proteins recognize specific DNA sequence elements and direct the recruitment of the replication machinery to the site of initial DNA synthesis (6Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the case of the extensively studied protein-primed replicon of bacteriophage Ø29, the parental TP is an active component of the replication origins located at both genome ends that contain the ITR 5′-AAAGTA, specifically recognized by the replication machinery formed by the primer TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer (7Illana B.

Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14678-14683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, TP-free Ø29 DNA terminal fragments retain about 10–15% of the template activity of TP-containing fragments (8González-Huici V. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14678-14683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Gutiérrez J. Garcı́a J.A. Blanco L. Salas M.

Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By deletion analysis of TP-free DNA fragments containing Ø29 terminal sequences, it was proposed that the minimal origins of replication are comprised within the terminal 12 bp, either from the right or left DNA ends (11Gutiérrez J. Garmendia C. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5895-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli phage PRD1 also has a linear genome that replicates by a protein-priming mechanism. It has been reported that, using TP-free fragments as templates, the terminal 20 bp of the 110-bp-long ITR are required for efficient in vitro DNA replication (12Yoo S-K. Ito J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The existence of a precise DNA sequence, required for efficient template recognition, has been also proposed for bacteriophage Cp-1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similarly, the terminal 18 bp of adenovirus genome represents the minimal replication origin and contains a 10-bp region (positions 9–18), conserved in all human adenoviruses, that is specifically recognized by the DNA polymerase complexed with the preterminal protein (Ø29 TP counterpart) (14Temperley S.M. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, it was demonstrated that the 3′ second nucleotide, with no significant sequence specificity, directs the incorporation of the complementary dNTP into the primer TP to form the initiation complex TP-dNMP (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Full-length Ø29 DNA replication requires the pairing of the initiator nucleotide to the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the template. This mechanism, named sliding-back, needs a terminal repetition of 2 bp and provides a mechanism to prevent mutations at the Ø29 DNA ends (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), since the 3′ exonuclease activity of Ø29 DNA polymerase cannot proofread the TP-linked nucleotide (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other protein-primed linear genomes, similar situations have been described; thus, in the case of Ø29-related bacteriophage GA-1 (5′-AAA), initiation also occurs at the 3′ second nucleotide of the template and, to a lesser extent, at the third nucleotide (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).S. pneumoniae phage Cp-1 initiates at the 3′ third nucleotide of its terminal repetition (5′-AAA) (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and E. coli phage PRD1 initiates at the fourth nucleotide (5′-GGGG) (18Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as adenoviruses, with a 5′-CATCAT reiteration (19King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The sliding-back mechanism of elongation seems to be a common feature of protein-priming systems to restore full-length DNA. In the case of phage GA-1, the residual initiation directed by the third nucleotide is proposed to jump-back pairing to the first nucleotide (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, for phages Cp-1 and PRD1, initiating, respectively, at the third and fourth nucleotide, a stepwise sliding-back mechanism that recovers the preceding nucleotides sequentially, is favored (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Adenovirus initiation complex elongates from the fourth to the sixth position, and then the TP-CAT is aligned with the three terminal bases of the template by a jumping-back mechanism (19King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this work we have further characterized the minimal sequence at the replication origin of Ø29 DNA required for an efficient initiation and elongation. We have found that conservation of the terminal repetition 5′-AA is necessary for the optimal formation of the initiation complex TP-dNMP. In particular, the 3′-terminal nucleotide, which is not used as template, modulates the initiation efficiency, impairing that of mutated templates. This checkpoint would provide a mechanism to preserve the nucleotide sequence of the genome ends. DISCUSSIONPhage Ø29 DNA replication origins are located at both ends of its linear double-stranded genome and are characterized by the presence of a TP covalently linked to each 5′ end (1Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). Although TP plays a crucial role in the origin recognition by the replication machinery, TP-free Ø29 DNA terminal fragments retain about 10–15% of their template activity in protein-primed initiation of replication (8González-Huici V. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14678-14683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Gutiérrez J. Garcı́a J.A. Blanco L. Salas M. Gene. 1986; 43: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis suggested a minimal origin of replication within the terminal 12 bp at each end; however, point mutations at the conserved positions did not affect their template activity except those at the second and third terminal positions, in which they were completely abolished when dATP was used as initiator nucleotide (11Gutiérrez J. Garmendia C. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5895-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results became clear when, by using single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, it was found that initiation of replication is directed by the second instead of the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the template (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The selection of the template initiation site is determined by the DNA polymerase-TP complex rather than the nucleotide sequence. Thus, the same Ø29 template is initiated at the third 3′-terminal position by the phage Cp-1 complex (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and at the second position by the Ø29 complex (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).We have further studied the role of the terminal nucleotide sequence in the efficiency of the initiation of replication by using TP-free double-stranded DNA fragments and a more active in vitrosystem in which Mn2+ is used as metal activator. The results obtained with fragments sharing a variable number of terminal bp with Ø29 ori L showed that the terminal repetition 5′-AA is the only requirement for an efficient initiation complex formation, ruling out a specific sequence recognition by the replication machinery. Our finding that a fragment that had the second, but not the first, terminal nucleotide conserved (fragment L1*, see Fig. 2) did not initiate replication, suggested a role for the 3′-terminal nucleotide. Furthermore, ori L CAA, ori L GAA, and ori L TAA showed reduced initiation activities (Fig. 4). We have ruled out the possibility that the first position is used as template for the formation of the initiation complex, since there is no specific incorporation of the dNMP complementary to the first position of mutated ori Ls (Fig. 3). There is no requirement for a mere terminal repetition of two nucleotides, as indicated by the activity ofori L CCA (7%), ori L GGA (22%), and ori L TTA (47%); these results cannot be explained on the different intrinsic affinity of Ø29 DNA polymerase for each dNTP in the initiation reaction, measured in the absence of template: 170% for dTTP, 63% for dGTP, and 22% for dCTP (100% for dATP) (25Blanco L. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1225-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether our results indicate that the 3′-terminal nucleotide, although not used as template, strongly influences the initiation complex formation directed by the second terminal nucleotide. The highest activity is obtained with a 3′-terminal T, regardless the nature of the initiator nucleotide; thus, ori L ACA was 2.4-fold more active than ori L CCA (not shown). Single mutations at the 3′ end increase the Km for dATP in the initiation event from 3 μm for the wild-typeori L to 10–28 μm for the mutants (not shown), with a Km value of 0.2 μm for TP-DNA (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′-terminal T of the template together with the 5′-linked parental TP increase the affinity of DNA polymerase for the initiator nucleotide, which is selected by the second position of template.A similar result was observed with single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, in which 3′-CTT showed a 30% initiation efficiency of the wild-type 3′-TTT (26Méndez J. Blanco L. Salas M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In other protein-primed replication systems such as S. pneumoniae phage Cp-1, in which the TP-linked nucleotide is selected by the third template nucleotide, a T to C mutation at the 3′-terminal position drops the initiation efficiency to 34% and below 1%, when the mutation is at the second position (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In E. coli phage PRD1, the initiation site is at the fourth template nucleotide; single-stranded oligonucleotides 3′-CTCC and 3′-CCTC show 11 and 52% wild-type 3′-CCCC initiation activity (18Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The fact that mutations of the nucleotides preceding the initiation site result in decreased initiation of replication is probably related to a structural requirement of the DNA polymerase active site, either to stabilize the initiator nucleotide and/or to form the covalent bond with TP. The conformation of the active site determines the efficiency of DNA polymerase to incorporate the correct nucleotide on the basis of steric (geometrical and electrostatic) constrictions rather than on the mere facility to form hydrogen bonds (27Moran S.

A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the initiation impairment of templates mutated at the 3′-terminal position could be to preserve the Ø29 genome ends, as Ø29 DNA polymerase cannot proofread the 5′-terminal nucleotide (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this would be an additional mechanism to that described for the sliding back, required for elongation of the initiation complex (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).In addition, there is a significant initiation directed by the 3′ third nucleotide of the template, as shown by the experiments with the single mutants ori L AAC, ori L AAG, and ori L AAT (Fig. 6). A residual initiation at the third position had been detected in some cases in single-stranded oligonucleotides with Ø29 (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and at a higher level with the related phage GA-1 (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We cannot measure independently the initiation directed by the second and third positions in wild-type ori L. However, the initiation activity with dATP of ori L AAC, ori L AAG, andori L AAT is lower than that of wild-type ori Land depends on the nature of the third 3′ nucleotide. Therefore, the initiation directed by the second 3′-terminal nucleotide is not only influenced by the first but also, to a lesser extent, by the third nucleotide, as the activity of the mutants at the third position is higher than that of the mutants at the first position (see Figs. 4 and7), even though the latter can use the second and third positions as template.It has been described that full-length elongation is achieved by a sliding-back mechanism from the second to the first template positions (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have also used point mutations of ori L fragments to study the template requirements for truncated elongation. As it was described previously for single-stranded templates (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), full-length elongation takes place with templates with a terminal repetition of two nucleotides (Fig. 8 A) to an extent similar to that of the wild-type ori L. This is also true when the terminal repetition is not 5′-AA. However, elongation is strongly impaired when the sliding back is prevented, as is the case of first position-mutatedori Ls (Fig. 8 B). The low initiation rate of these mutants does not fully account for their poor elongation. In these cases the elongation products are one nucleotide shorter, ruling out a mismatched sliding back. The residual elongation could be due to an initiation at the third position followed by a sliding back to the second position and/or to an initiation at the second position followed by elongation with no sliding back. The latter possibility was demonstrated with mutants in which any sliding back is prevented, such as ori L TAT and ori L AGA, which again give rise to elongation products one nucleotide shorter than full-length. In contrast, ori L ATA produced a full-length elongate, suggesting that initiation at the third position (3–5-fold higher than that of ori L TAT and ori L AGA) is followed by a jump back to the first position. A similar jumping-back mechanism has been suggested for Ø29-related phage GA-1 (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In adenovirus, initiation occurs at the 3′ fourth position, and elongation proceeds to the sixth, then by jumping back, aligns the trinucleotide to the three 3′-terminal positions (19King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have determined the sequence requirements for efficient replication of Ø29 DNA at the stages of initiation and elongation. In addition to the 3′ second T at the 3′ end, the third T is also used as template for TP-dAMP synthesis. More interestingly, the 3′-terminal T, although not used as template, is required for efficient initiation, providing a mechanism to prevent mutations at the Ø29 genome ends. Phage Ø29 DNA replication origins are located at both ends of its linear double-stranded genome and are characterized by the presence of a TP covalently linked to each 5′ end (1Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). Although TP plays a crucial role in the origin recognition by the replication machinery, TP-free Ø29 DNA terminal fragments retain about 10–15% of their template activity in protein-primed initiation of replication (8González-Huici V. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14678-14683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Gutiérrez J. Garcı́a J.A. Blanco L. Salas M. Gene. 1986; 43: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis suggested a minimal origin of replication within the terminal 12 bp at each end; however, point mutations at the conserved positions did not affect their template activity except those at the second and third terminal positions, in which they were completely abolished when dATP was used as initiator nucleotide (11Gutiérrez J. Garmendia C. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5895-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results became clear when, by using single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, it was found that initiation of replication is directed by the second instead of the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the template (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The selection of the template initiation site is determined by the DNA polymerase-TP complex rather than the nucleotide sequence. Thus, the same Ø29 template is initiated at the third 3′-terminal position by the phage Cp-1 complex (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and at the second position by the Ø29 complex (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have further studied the role of the terminal nucleotide sequence in the efficiency of the initiation of replication by using TP-free double-stranded DNA fragments and a more active in vitrosystem in which Mn2+ is used as metal activator. The results obtained with fragments sharing a variable number of terminal bp with Ø29 ori L showed that the terminal repetition 5′-AA is the only requirement for an efficient initiation complex formation, ruling out a specific sequence recognition by the replication machinery. Our finding that a fragment that had the second, but not the first, terminal nucleotide conserved (fragment L1*, see Fig. 2) did not initiate replication, suggested a role for the 3′-terminal nucleotide. Furthermore, ori L CAA, ori L GAA, and ori L TAA showed reduced initiation activities (Fig. 4). We have ruled out the possibility that the first position is used as template for the formation of the initiation complex, since there is no specific incorporation of the dNMP complementary to the first position of mutated ori Ls (Fig. 3). There is no requirement for a mere terminal repetition of two nucleotides, as indicated by the activity ofori L CCA (7%), ori L GGA (22%), and ori L TTA (47%); these results cannot be explained on the different intrinsic affinity of Ø29 DNA polymerase for each dNTP in the initiation reaction, measured in the absence of template: 170% for dTTP, 63% for dGTP, and 22% for dCTP (100% for dATP) (25Blanco L. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1225-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether our results indicate that the 3′-terminal nucleotide, although not used as template, strongly influences the initiation complex formation directed by the second terminal nucleotide. The highest activity is obtained with a 3′-terminal T, regardless the nature of the initiator nucleotide; thus, ori L ACA was 2.4-fold more active than ori L CCA (not shown). Single mutations at the 3′ end increase the Km for dATP in the initiation event from 3 μm for the wild-typeori L to 10–28 μm for the mutants (not shown), with a Km value of 0.2 μm for TP-DNA (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′-terminal T of the template together with the 5′-linked parental TP increase the affinity of DNA polymerase for the initiator nucleotide, which is selected by the second position of template. A similar result was observed with single-stranded oligonucleotides as templates, in which 3′-CTT showed a 30% initiation efficiency of the wild-type 3′-TTT (26Méndez J. Blanco L. Salas M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In other protein-primed replication systems such as S. pneumoniae phage Cp-1, in which the TP-linked nucleotide is selected by the third template nucleotide, a T to C mutation at the 3′-terminal position drops the initiation efficiency to 34% and below 1%, when the mutation is at the second position (13Martı́n A.C. Blanco L. Garcı́a P. Salas M. Méndez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In E. coli phage PRD1, the initiation site is at the fourth template nucleotide; single-stranded oligonucleotides 3′-CTCC and 3′-CCTC show 11 and 52% wild-type 3′-CCCC initiation activity (18Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fact that mutations of the nucleotides preceding the initiation site result in decreased initiation of replication is probably related to a structural requirement of the DNA polymerase active site, either to stabilize the initiator nucleotide and/or to form the covalent bond with TP. The conformation of the active site determines the efficiency of DNA polymerase to incorporate the correct nucleotide on the basis of steric (geometrical and electrostatic) constrictions rather than on the mere facility to form hydrogen bonds (27Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10506-10511Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 28Goodman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the initiation impairment of templates mutated at the 3′-terminal position could be to preserve the Ø29 genome ends, as Ø29 DNA polymerase cannot proofread the 5′-terminal nucleotide (16Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this would be an additional mechanism to that described for the sliding back, required for elongation of the initiation complex (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a significant initiation directed by the 3′ third nucleotide of the template, as shown by the experiments with the single mutants ori L AAC, ori L AAG, and ori L AAT (Fig. 6). A residual initiation at the third position had been detected in some cases in single-stranded oligonucleotides with Ø29 (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and at a higher level with the related phage GA-1 (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We cannot measure independently the initiation directed by the second and third positions in wild-type ori L. However, the initiation activity with dATP of ori L AAC, ori L AAG, andori L AAT is lower than that of wild-type ori Land depends on the nature of the third 3′ nucleotide. Therefore, the initiation directed by the second 3′-terminal nucleotide is not only influenced by the first but also, to a lesser extent, by the third nucleotide, as the activity of the mutants at the third position is higher than that of the mutants at the first position (see Figs. 4 and7), even though the latter can use the second and third positions as template. It has been described that full-length elongation is achieved by a sliding-back mechanism from the second to the first template positions (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have also used point mutations of ori L fragments to study the template requirements for truncated elongation. As it was described previously for single-stranded templates (15Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), full-length elongation takes place with templates with a terminal repetition of two nucleotides (Fig. 8 A) to an extent similar to that of the wild-type ori L. This is also true when the terminal repetition is not 5′-AA. However, elongation is strongly impaired when the sliding back is prevented, as is the case of first position-mutatedori Ls (Fig. 8 B). The low initiation rate of these mutants does not fully account for their poor elongation. In these cases the elongation products are one nucleotide shorter, ruling out a mismatched sliding back. The residual elongation could be due to an initiation at the third position followed by a sliding back to the second position and/or to an initiation at the second position followed by elongation with no sliding back. The latter possibility was demonstrated with mutants in which any sliding back is prevented, such as ori L TAT and ori L AGA, which again give rise to elongation products one nucleotide shorter than full-length. In contrast, ori L ATA produced a full-length elongate, suggesting that initiation at the third position (3–5-fold higher than that of ori L TAT and ori L AGA) is followed by a jump back to the first position. A similar jumping-back mechanism has been suggested for Ø29-related phage GA-1 (17Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In adenovirus, initiation occurs at the 3′ fourth position, and elongation proceeds to the sixth, then by jumping back, aligns the trinucleotide to the three 3′-terminal positions (19King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have determined the sequence requirements for efficient replication of Ø29 DNA at the stages of initiation and elongation. In addition to the 3′ second T at the 3′ end, the third T is also used as template for TP-dAMP synthesis. More interestingly, the 3′-terminal T, although not used as template, is required for efficient initiation, providing a mechanism to prevent mutations at the Ø29 genome ends. We are grateful to J. M. Lázaro and L. Villar for purification of proteins and Ø29 DNA and to M. de Vega and L. Menéndez-Arias for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1994776977,"The yeast Gal4 protein, like many activators, binds TATA-binding protein (TBP) directly <i>in vitro</i>. It has been speculated that this protein-protein interaction is important for Gal4p-mediated activation of transcription, but little work has been done to test specific models involving this interaction. In this study, the effect of Gal4p on TBP-TATA binding is addressed. Specifically, it is asked if the Gal4p-TBP interaction can support cooperative binding of the two factors to promoters. It is easy to see how such an event could stimulate transcription, particularly from promoters with a non-consensus TATA box. <i>In vitro</i>, however, a derivative of Gal4p (Gal4-(1–93+768–881)) containing the DNA-binding, dimerization, and activation domains does not bind to promoter DNA cooperatively with either recombinant, purified TBP, or with protein from a yeast crude extract. <i>In vivo</i>, reporter gene experiments using promoters with differing TBP affinities reveal no major Gal4p-mediated stimulation of TBP function from weak TATA boxes, as would be predicted if the proteins bind cooperatively. Furthermore, native Gal4p and a potent Gal4p-based artificial activator lacking a TBP-binding activation domain support similar ratios of transcription from a series of promoters identical except for mutations in the TATA box. It is concluded that Gal4p and TBP do not bind cooperatively to promoters and that this mechanism does not contribute substantially to Gal4p-mediated transcriptional activation."
