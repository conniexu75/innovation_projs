https://openalex.org/W2051035237,"Electron microscopic examination of SV40 chromatin prepared 44 hr post-infection led to the visualization of a nucleosome-free region (gap) in 15-20% of the minichromosomes. Minichromosomes with and without a gap displayed a mean number of 24 nucleosomes. Measurements carried out on dark field micrographs yielded for the gap a mean length of 249 +/- 13 bp, with a maximum value of 385 bp. The gap was mapped following digestion with three single-cut restriction endonucleases: Bgl l, Bam HI and Eco RI. It was located in the region of the origin of replication in accordance with previous biochemical data. To assess the situ existence of a nucleosome-free region, nuclei from infected cells were digested with DNase I. A highly sensitive region was thus revealed and mapped by secondary digestion with Eco RI. It was located in the same region as the gap, between 0.67 and 0.74 on the physical map. The sensitive region could be detected throughout the late phase of the virus cycle. These findings strongly suggest that a nucleosome-free region exists in the cells. The gap is not likely to be involved in replication, since it is asymmetric with respect to the Bgl I cleavage site, from which replication proceeds symmetrically."
https://openalex.org/W2008897847,"We have identified and characterized a genetic function (designated par, for partition) that is required for stable maintenance of plasmids within exponentially growing cell populations. This function, which accomplishes the active distribution of plasmid DNA molecules to daughter cells, has been localized within the pSC101 plasmid to a 270 bp segment adjacent to the replication origin. The par locus, which appears to be functionally equivalent to the centromere of eucaryotic cells, is able to rescue unstable pSC101-derived replicons or an unrelated par- P15A-derived multicopy replicon in the cis, but not the trans, configuration. It is independent of copy number control and dose not specify plasmid incompatibility. Furthermore, it is not associated directly with plasmid replication functions."
https://openalex.org/W1980424753,"The somatic 5S DNA from X. borealis (Xbs 5S DNA) and X. laevis (Xls 5S DNA) and a minor oocyte-specific 5S DNA from X. laevis (Xlt 5S DNA) have been purified, and individual repeating units have been cloned and sequenced. The two somatic 5S DNAs differ from the major oocyte 5S DNAs in having GC-rich spacers, homogeneous repeat lengths and no “pseudogenes.” The somatic 5S DNAs from the two species have similar spacer sequences with differences due to single base changes and insertions/deletions. The spacer of the minor oocyte-specific 5S DNA (Xlt) has the AT-rich sequence characteristic of the major oocyte 5S DNAs from X. laevis and X. borealis, and contains one duplication that has diverged approximately 40%. Like the somatic 5S DNAs, Xlt 5S DNA has a homogeneous length repeat and a unique nucleotide sequence in its spacer. The presence of variable-length spacer regions in a multigene family correlates with variable numbers of a simple sequence in the spacer regions."
https://openalex.org/W2156756156,"The surface distribution of the envelope glycoproteins of Influenza, Sendai and Vesicular Stomatitis viruses was studied by immunofluorescence and immunoelectromicroscopy in infected epithelial cell monolayers, from which these viruses bud in a polarized fashion. It was found that before the onset of viral budding, the envelope proteins are exclusively localized into the same plasma membrane domains of the epithelial cells from which the virions ultimately bud: the glycoproteins of Influenza and Sendai were detected at the apical surface, while the G protein of Vesicular Stomatitis virus was concentrated at the basolateral region. On the other hand, Sendai virus nucleocapsids, which can be easily identified in the cytoplasm before viral assembly, could be observed throughout the cell, not showing any preferential localization near the surface that the virions utilize for budding. These results are consistent with a model in which the asymmetric distribution of viral envelope proteins, rather than a polarized delivery of nucleocapsids, directs the polarity of viral budding. Furthermore, the asymmetric surface localization of viral glycoproteins suggests that these proteins share with intrinsic surface proteins of epithelial cells common biogenetic mechanisms and informational features or “sorting out” signals that determine their compartmentalization in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1992639966,"In this paper we describe a method for constructing E. coli plasmids that direct efficient expression of genes that encode eucaryotic or procaryotic proteins. No functional assays for the proteins are needed, and they are produced in their native, unfused state. The only requirement is that the genes be isolable without intervening sequences. We describe as an example the construction of a plasmid that directs the synthesis of about 10,000–15,000 monomers per cell of rabbit β-globin. The essential steps in a typical construction are as follows. —A region of the gene encoding the amino-terminal portion of the protein is fused to DNA encoding an enzymatically active carboxy terminal fragment of β-galactosidase. The latter is carried on one of three plasmids designed to facilitate the fusion (the construction of these three plasmids is described in the Appendix). —A “portable promoter” of the lac operon is placed at many positions in front of the fused gene using nucleases in vitro. Those promoter placements that elicit efficient expression of the fused gene are identified by the β-galatosidase activity that they express. (In the special case we describe, plasmids identified as directing efficient expression of β-globin were found to bear “hybrid” ribosome binding sites consisting of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence carried on the promoter fragment and the ATG of the β-globin gene.) —The gene interest is reconstituted intact, with the portable promoter in place, by recombination in vitro or in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2054735159,"We have discovered that DNA gyrase interlocks duplex DNA circles to form catenanes and resolves catenanes into component monomers. The reactions were inhibited by novobiocin and oxolinic acid and required ATP, Mg++ and spermidine. DNA sequence homology is not involved in catenation, since hybrid catenanes were formed efficiently between supercoiled phi X174 and Col E1 DNA. Strikingly different results were obtained with native and relaxed Col E1 DNA substrates. Up to 50-60% of input native DNA was converted into oligomeric catenanes, predominantly dimers and trimers. Relaxed substrates were instead converted into vast interlocked networks and were occasionally knotted. Optimal catenation occurred only in the narrow range of 20-35 mM KCl; increased ionic strength blocked catenation completely but activated the back reaction of decatenation. Gyrase resolved both the oligomeric catenanes and interlocked networks it produced, as well as naturally occurring catenanes. These results imply that the mechanism of gyrase involves a transient double-strand break and passage of a DNA segment through the resulting gap. Gyrase is representative of a general class of enzymes, found in both procaryotic and eucaryotic cells, that facilitate diffusion of duplex DNA segments through each other and may thereby solve topological problems arising from the replication, recombination and condensation of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1499737326,"Ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli consists of two nonidentical subunits, proteins B1 and B2. The active site is made up from both subunits. Protein B2 contains 2 iron atoms and a tyrosyl-free radical, which are essential for the enzymatic activity. The paramagnetic susceptibility of protein B2 has been measured over the temperature range 30-200 K. A deviation from the Curie law is observed at high temperatures, consistent with a structure of an antiferromagnetically coupled pair of high spin Fe(III) with an exchange coupling -J = 108(-20)+25 cm-1. Electronic spectra are resolved into components from the iron center and the radical. A band at 600 nm is clearly identified and shown to have contributions from both components. The electronic absorptions of the tyrosyl radical of protein B2 are closely similar to those reported for phenoxy radicals of tyrosine and tritertiary butyl phenol. Determinations by EPR of the amount of free radical suggest the possibility of more than one radical per active protein B2 molecule. Reconstitution of the active site from apoprotein B2 and Fe(II) is only observed in the presence of oxygen. With Fe(III), no reconstitution is obtained. The additional physical data on the iron center of protein B2 strengthen the analogy with oxidized forms of hemerythrin. The most likely structure is an antiferromagnetically coupled pair of high spin Fe(III), possibly with a bridging oxo-group."
https://openalex.org/W2063083144,"Incubation of 32P-5′ end-labeled DNA fragments of <500 bp with excess amounts of the 3′ → 5′, double strand-dependent nuclease Exonuclease III generally results in single-stranded products of slightly more than half the size of the uncleaved substrate. When such restriction fragments of known size and sequence containing the lac operator were incubated with purified lac repressor, Exonuclease III cleavage was blocked at the 3′ borders of the operator on each strand. It was possible to define the DNA sequence between the two boundaries of repressor-mediated exonuclease blockade by electrophoresing the single-stranded, protected products in urea-containing polyacrylamide gels in parallel with a dimethylsulfate modification-cleavage digest of the end-labeled, uncleaved substrate. The same approach was applied to an analysis of sites of large SV40 T antigen protection in the vicinity of the origin of SV40 DNA replication. Three discrete boundaries of apparent protection were observed—one on the “late” side of the origin and two on the “early” side. These sequences may constitute the 3′ borders of discrete T antigen-binding sites in the origin region. Alternatively, one or more of these blockade points may signify regions of the genome which undergo conformational changes resulting in Exonuclease III resistance due to vicinal T antigen binding."
https://openalex.org/W1579749395,"The region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) containing the oxi 2 locus has been sequenced in a rho- clone (DS40) derived from the respiratory competent strain D273-10B/A48 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The DS40 clone was established to have retained only genetic markers in the oxi 2 locus and to have a segment of mtDNA extending from 18.6 to 24.3 units of the wild type map. The mitochondrial genome of DS40 includes a sequence that has been tentatively identified as the structural gene of Subunit 3 of cytochrome oxidase. The coding sequence is 810 nucleotides long and generates a protein with a molecular weight of 30,340. The amino acid composition of the oxi 2 gene product deduced from the nucleotide sequence is in agreement with the composition of the purified Subunit 3 of yeast cytochrome oxidase. The orientation of the DS40 mtDNA segment relative to wild type mtDNA indicates that the oxi 2 gene is transcribed from the same DNA strand as the oxi 1 and several other mitochondrial genes."
https://openalex.org/W1533877914,"An NAD- and guanidine-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase has been purified more than 500,000-fold from turkey erythrocytes with an 18% yield. The enzyme in the 100,000 X g supernatant fraction was bound to phenyl-Sepharose, eluted with 50% propylene glycol, and further purified by sequential chromatographic steps on carboxymethylcellulose, NAD-agarose and concanavalin A-agarose. The transferase was specifically eluted from concanavalin A-agarose with alpha-methylmannoside. The enzymatic activity was extremely labile following the first purification step. Both propylene glycol and NaCl stabilized the transferase; significant increases in enzyme recovery were obtained by conducting the NAD- and concanavalin A-agarose chromatography in buffer containing propylene glycol. The purified protein exhibits one predominant protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an estimated molecular weight of 28,300. On Ultrogel AcA54 chromatography, single coincident peaks of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and protein were observed. Enzyme activity was independent of DNA; the highly purified transferase was inhibited by thymidine, nicotinamide, and theophylline. The specific activity of the purified enzyme (350 mumol of ADP-ribose transferred from NAD to arginine methyl estermin-1mg-1) is comparable to that reported for purified NAD glycohydrolases and poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferases."
https://openalex.org/W2032980997,"The single insertion of SV40 DNA present in the genome of the 14B line of transformed rat cells has been cloned in procaryotic vectors. Analysis of the clones reveals a complex arrangement of viral sequences in which a small tract of DNA is inverted with respect to the major insertion. The nucleotide sequences at the two junctions show sharp transitions between cellular and viral sequences. The sequences which flank the viral insertion have been used as probes to clone the corresponding genomic sequences from the DNA of untransformed rat cells. Analysis of the structure of these clones shows that a rearrangement of cellular sequences has occurred, presumably as a consequence of integration. When 14B cells are fused with uninfected simian cells a heterogeneous set of low molecular weight superhelical DNAs containing viral sequences is generated. These have been cloned in procaryotic vectors and their structures have been analyzed. All of them span the origin of SV40 DNA replication and are colinear with various segments of the integrated viral DNA and its flanking sequences. The shorter molecules contain part of the integrated viral genome and cellular sequences from one side of the insertion. They were therefore generated by recombination between the viral DNA and its flanking cellular sequences. The longer molecules contain cellular sequences from both sides of the insertion as well as an entire copy of the integrated viral DNA. They were therefore generated by recombination between the flanking cellular sequences. These results argue strongly against the involvement of specific excision enzymes, and rather are discussed in terms of a model involving replication of the integrated viral DNA followed by recombination for release of integrated viral sequences."

The products include oligomers of 30 to 40 units in length. The nucleotide residues are predominantly 2′-5′ linked when Pb2+ is the catalyst, and predominantly 3′-5′ linked in the presence of Zn2+. The significance of these results in the context of the prebiotic evolution of RNA polymerase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561270065,"Calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase was purified from bovine brain to apparent homogeneity by a new procedure involving DEAE-cellulose, Affi-Gel blue, calmodulin-Sepharose 4B, and Sephadex G-200 column chromatographies. The enzyme was purified more than 3,000-fold from the brain extracts with greater than 12% yield. The purified phosphodiesterase could be activated 10- to 15-fold by calmodulin and Ca2+ to a specific enzyme activity of more than 300 mumol of cAMP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein. Molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 115,800 by the sedimentation equilibirum method or 124,000 from the sedimentation constant and Stokes radius of the protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme showed a single protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 58,000. These results suggested that the calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase from bovine brain has a subunit structure of alpha2. Molecular weight of the complex of calmodulin and phosphodiesterase was the complex of calmodulin and phosphodiesterase was also calculated from the sedimentation constant and Stokes radius to be 159,000. Since calmodulin has a molecular weight of about 17,000, the result indicated that the stoichiometry of the complex is calmodulin2 alpha2. The catalytic subunit of cylic AMP-dependent protein kinase was found to catalyze the phosphorylation of the purified phosphodiesterase with the incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1994564605,"Established mouse cell lines, primary cultures of mouse cells, and differentiated cell lines derived from mouse teratocarcinoma are permissive to polyoma virus. No viral early or late functions are expressed upon infection and penetration of multipotential embryonal cell lines. Polyoma mutants capable of growth on these cells were isolated and their DNA was cloned. Both the linear cloned viral DNA and a hybrid composed of mutant Bam HI (0.58) to Bgl I (0.72) 750 bp fragment (containing the origin of replication) ligated to the complementary wild-type 4.5 kb fragment are able to multiply on PCC4 embryonal carcinoma cells. The nucleotide sequence of two mutants indicated a genomic rearrangement on the late side of the origin, in which a deletion starting at nucleotides 46 (Py 204) and 77 (Py97) and terminating for both in nucleotide 107 was replaced by the duplication of a downstream late sequence starting at nucleotide 138 (Py 204) and 157 Py97) and terminating in nucleotide 220. The fact that the sequence rearrangements permit the expression of early and late functions upon infection suggests that this region participates in the control of early transcription. This control is different in embryonal and differentiated mouse cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044065128,"Extracts from X. laevis germinal vesicles interlock duplex DNA circles to form catenanes. The catenation activity requires Mg++ and ATP. Negatively supercoiled or relaxed DNA can be used as substrates for the catenation reaction. Homology between donor and acceptor DNA is not required, since catenanes are formed between DNA molecules with unrelated sequences. In the course of the isolation of the activity responsible for the catenation reaction, we discovered a new ATP-dependent topoisomerase.

https://openalex.org/W1625856192,"Purified bovine thymus poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase is a monomeric protein with a single polypeptide chain having a molecular weight of approximately 130,000, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, and gel filtration. A high frictional ratio (1.81) indicated that the molecule has an elongated shape, or a high solvation, or both. The enzyme is a basic protein (pI 9.8), and amino acid analysis showed a relatively high lysine content. The enzyme activity is dependent on double-stranded DNA and is solely correlated with single- or double-stranded breaks on the DNA. Filter binding assay technique showed that the enzyme-activating efficiency of DNA correlated sufficiently with its enzyme-binding efficiency. Thus, a very high enzyme-activating efficiency of a DNA fraction (active DNA) which was separated from the crude enzyme fraction is mainly due to its high enzyme-binding efficiency. It was also shown that single-stranded DNA and heparin had a strong inhibitory effect on the binding of the enzyme to double-stranded DNA, whereas competitive inhibitors did not affect the binding, We interpret these results to indicate that the binding of the enzyme to double-stranded DNA is a prerequisite step to its catalytic activity and has a dual function: (a) to position the enzyme on specific binding sites such as single- or double-stranded breaks on the DNA, and (b) to induce an active conformation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1548929040,"Sodium and potassium ion-activated adenosine triphosphatase is known to be composed of at least two different polypeptides, alpha and beta. When a detergent-treated supernatant preparation of the enzyme is reacted with the cross-linking reagent, cupric phenanthroline, a single, covalent heterodimer is formed. This product is formed from one of each of the two polypeptides. The remaining, unreacted alpha and beta chains maintain a constant ratio to each other throughout the reaction. The same heterodimer is formed in membrane-bound enzyme when reacted with several other cross-linking reagents. The protein mass ratio between the chains in the native enzyme, determined by two methods, is 2.15 +/- 0.16. Using this value and a value of 121,000 +/- 6,000 for the molecular weight of the larger polypeptide, a molecular weight of 56,000 +/- 7,000 can be calculated for the protein portion of the smaller polypeptide. Upon removal of a substantial portion of the carbohydrate from the smaller polypeptide, a change in its electrophoretic mobility is observed, while that of the larger polypeptide remains unaffected. The apparent length of this unglycosylated small chain is 450 residues, corresponding to a molecular weight of 51,000. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the two polypeptides of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase exist in an equimolar, noncovalent association in the native enzyme, and that the protein molecular weight of the minimum asymmetric unit is 177,000 +/- 13,000, Previous results which address the question of the quaternary structure of the ATPase are re-examined in light of these determinations."
https://openalex.org/W2086063025,"Angiogenesis is associated with the fragmentation of blood vessel basement membranes. Since collagen is a major constituent of basement membranes, cultured human endothelial cells derived from umbilical cord veins were assayed for their ability to produce collagenase. Unstimulated cultured human endothelial cells did not secrete detectable levels of active collagenase into the culture medium. However, if the post-culture medium was treated with trypsin or plasmin, low levels of collagenolytic activity were detected, indicating that endothelial cells secrete small amounts of latent collagenase. Addition of the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to the culture medium stimulated the secretion of collagenase by endothelial cells 5–30 fold. More than 90% of the collagenase was secreted in the latent form. Stimulation of collagenase production was detected at 10−9 M TPA and was maximal at 10−8 M TPA. An increase in the rate of collagenase production could be detected within 3 hr after the addition of TPA, and full induction occurred by 12 hr. Cycloheximide (3 μg/ml) or actinomycin D (0.1 μg/ml) inhibited both basal levels of collagenase production and the stimulation of collagenase production by TPA. Phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PDD), a tumor-promoting analog of TPA, also stimulated collagenase production when administered at the same concentrations that were effective for TPA. However, 4-O-methyl TPA and 4-αPDD, two analogs of TPA which are not tumor promoters, did not stimulate collagenase production at concentrations up to 10−7 M. The collagenase produced by endothelial cells was a typical vertebrate collagenase as judged by the following criteria: it cleaved collagen into only two fragments which were three quarters and one quarter of the length of the intact molecule; it was inhibited by EDTA and human serum; it was not inhibited by inhibitors of serine, thiol or aspartate proteases. Thus TPA causes an increase in the production of latent collagenase by cultured human endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971442611,The restriction endonuclease Eco K binds to a host specificity site and then proceeds to cleave the DNA at sites that may to several thousand bases away. It does this by translocating the DNA past the enzyme in an ATP-dependent reaction that results in the formation of highly twisted loop intermediates. DNA cleavage can occur on either side of the host specificity site.
https://openalex.org/W2016256079,"We used a specially constructed strain, cyc1-345, of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to isolate revertants that initiated translation of iso-1-cytochrome c at various sites along an extended region of the mRNA. Normal amounts of iso-1-cytochrome c occurred when translation initiated at the abnormal sites corresponding to amino acid positions -3, -2, 3 and 5, as well as the normal position -1; 20% of the normal amounts occurred when translation initiated at the abnormal position 9. These results with cyc1-345 revertants indicate that translation of iso-1-cytochrome c can initiate with the normal efficiency at any site within the region spanning 25 nucleotides. Furthermore, because the lower amount of the short iso-1-cytochrome c in the mutant initiating at position 9 may not necessarily reflect an inefficiency of translation, we believe that translation can initiate with normal or near-normal efficiencies at any site within a 37 nucleotide region, and presumably at any site preceding and following that of the normal initiation codon. These results establish that there is no absolute requirement for a particular sequence 5' to the initiation codon, and are consistent with our previous suggestion that translation starts at the AUG codon closest to the 5' end of the mRNA."

The equilibrium association constant for the complex has been determined as a function of ionic strength and varies between (6.0 +/- 3.6) x 10(6) M-1 and (2.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) M-1 over the ionic strength range 0.01 M to 0.20 M."
https://openalex.org/W1493629266,"The influence of all trans-retinoic acid on cyclic AMP metabolism was examined in B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells. Treatment of these cells with retinoic acid resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth which was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in both basal and cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase activity, Intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, however, were not altered by retinoid treatment. A protein kinase-deficient variant of B16-F1 (MR-4) did not exhibit decreased growth or increased protein kinase activity in response to retinoic acid treatment. At least 24 h of incubation was required before increased protein kinase activity could be detected in treated B16-F1 cells. Retinoic acid treatment increased the Vmax of protein kinase, but the Ka for cyclic AMP activation was not altered. These findings suggest that in B16 mouse melanoma cells, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase may be a target for the growth inhibitory effects of the retinoid."

https://openalex.org/W1988670401,"Abstract The mouse genome harbors a set of genes reiterated 20–50 times that normally expresses 30S RNA transcripts. These transcripts can be rescued specifically into virions of helper-independent C-type viruses as pseudotypes and are thought to be defective endogenous retroviruses. We cloned DNA sequences coding 30S RNA from a gene library of the inbred mouse strain BALB/c in bacteriophage lambda. We identified the sequences by their hybridization with an RNA abundant in preparation of MuLV virions produced by mouse cells but sharing no sequence homology with the MuLV genome, and by the ability of the cloned DNAs to hybridize specifically with the poly(A)-containing 30S RNA present in the cytoplasm of uninfected mouse cells. The 30S RNAs are encoded by uninterrupted 5 kb DNA sequences in the genome. Individual copies of virus-like genes were distributed at different loci and were flanked by cellular DNA sequences that shared no apparent sequence homology. Each of the virus-like genes is related but not identical to all other copies. Two levels of genetic heterogeneity were detected: the first results from relatively large, continuous sequences of nonhomology up to 300 bp long; the second results from a pattern of scattered base substitutions suggesting that some DNA sequences might have been conserved more than others."
https://openalex.org/W1563905113,"Several enzymes that interfere with the enzymatic assay of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates (dNTP's) are present as contaminants when nucleotides are extracted from HeLa cells with 60% methanol. These activities include a nuclease, nucleoside diphosphokinase, and deoxyribonucleoside monophosphokinases which phosphorylate dAMP, dGMP, and dCMP. Collectively, these enzymes are able to degrade and reutilize the DNA template which is used together with DNA polymerase for dNTP assays. This process introduces large errors when dNTP assays are performed in this manner. Attempts to block the enzymatic conversion of deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates to triphosphates by inhibition of nucleoside diphosphokinase were unsuccessful because of the inability to block completely the kinase activity. Acid extraction of nucleotides also results in the presence of an activity that interferes with the enzymatic dNTP assay. The error introduced by this interfering activity is much smaller than that arising from the enzymes present in methanol extracts. All of these interfering activities are removed when cells are first extracted with 60% methanol and the resulting extract is subsequently treated with perchloric acid."

https://openalex.org/W2008361081,"Ten clones of Charon 4A containing proviruses of spleen necrosis virus, an avian retrovirus, and flanking chicken DNA sequences were isolated and characterized. Some clones gave rise to progeny with viral DNA sequences deleted or duplicated, probably as a result of crossing-over in the 600 bp terminal redundancy in viral DNA. The cellular sequences are different in each clone, indicating that all the proviruses are integrated in different sites in cellular DNA. Six clones are infectious and four are not. All the infectious molecules containing a provirus are of a similar size and are smaller than the noninfectious molecules containing a provirus. The viral DNA is not apparently different in eight clones, but two clones, one infectious and one noninfectious, lack two restriction sites each. Large changes in proviral DNA therefore do not seem responsible for the lack of infectivity of some clones. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that neighboring cellular DNA sequences control proviral expression (infectivity)."
https://openalex.org/W2054244128,"Replicative intermediates of SV40 were isolated, digested with the restriction endonuclease Bgl I and examined by electron microscopy. Over 98% of the replicative intermediates isolated following infection with wild-type virions at 33 degrees, 37 degrees or 40 degrees C or with tsA209 at 33 degrees C had initiated replication about 35 nucleotides to one side of the Bgl I site. Approximately 1% of the molecules had initiated replication about 2400 nucleotides from the Bgl I site. The remaining molecules may have initiated at other sites. When tsA209 virion-infected cultures were shifted to 40.5 degrees C for 90 min, the relative rate of thymidine incorporation into superhelical viral DNA dropped by more than 97%. The remaining incorporation was not due to ""leakiness."" The label incorporated into mature superhelical molecules during brief pulses was not preferentially incorporated near the terminus of replication as it was at 33 degrees C. Approximately 33% of the incorporated label represented repair synthesis. Electron microscopy revealed that half of the replicative intermediates formed under these conditions appear to have been initiated randomly around the SV40 genome. Rolling circle molecules contaminated all the preparations of replicative intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2058698891,"The region coding for apocytochrome b in the mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is believed to exhibit a mosaic organization, consisting in certain strains of five exons and four introns. This model can be tested by the use of double mutants, each containing two physically, genetically and phenotypically defined mit- lesions in cis, (that is, in the same mitochondrial chromosome). Such mutants have been constructed, and the phenotypes of several examples of each of the four possible classes--exon-exon, exon-intron (downstream), intron (upstream)-exon and intron-intron--have been examined. Our results have shown that upstream mutations are always epistatic to downstream ones for polypeptide products, and that regulation of expression of cytochrome oxidase subunit I by introns is epistatic regardless of position. These findings have provided an independent verification of the mosaic model, and also suggest that at least the majority of novel polypeptides accumulating in intron mutants are hybrid products that contain sequences of the wild-type polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1546080946,"Considerable amounts of five glycolytic enzymes glucosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, became fixed when intact synaptosomes were incubated with glutaraldehyde.

The isoenzymes enriched in muscle subunits were rapidly immobilized by glutaraldehyde, while the isoenzymes enriched in heart subunits, especially H4, were not. It is suggested that the enzymes which were immobilized are located near the synaptosomal membrane, perhaps in association with actin, which is found at this site. The enzymes that showed a much smaller degree of fixation were either randomly distributed in the synaptoplasm or less susceptible to fixation."

The enzyme with altered specificity, designated Bam HI.1, generated digestion patterns of various DNAs, which were distinct from those generated by Bam HI. Cleavage sites recognized in phiX174 RF DNA in the presence of these hydrophobic reagents are not related to the Bam HI palindrome. Bam HI.1 appears to be an endogenous form of Bam HI that can be expressed by altering the hydrophobicity of the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1617066248,"Using a rapid phenol extraction assay, an enzyme was purified from uninfected HeLa cells that can cleave the 5'-terminal protein (VPg) from poliovirus RNA. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts had enzymes with similar behavior. A polypeptide of molecular weight 27,000 was the major one present in the purified preparation. Assuming that this protein is the enzyme, a very low turnover number was calculated for it. The purified enzyme would cleave the tyrosine-phosphate bond linking VPg to poliovirus RNA with minimal degradation of the RNA or of VPg. If the RNA was first treated with proteinase K to degrade VPg, leaving a small peptide on the RNA, this peptide could also be removed by the enzyme. If the RNA was degraded with T1 RNase, leaving VPg attached to a nonanucleotide, the enzyme still would cleave off VPg, although incompletely. If the RNA was degraded completely, leaving either pUp or pU attached to VPg, the enzyme would not remove the nucleotides from the protein. Thus, for the enzyme to be active requires some length of polynucleotide attached to the protein but only a short peptide need be present for the enzyme to act."
https://openalex.org/W2034639698,"Abstract In polyoma virus the origin of replication, the 5′ ends of early mRNAs, and the initiation codon for early protein synthesis map within an approximately 200 bp region of the genome. We have previously reported the isolation and partial characterization of viable mutants of polyoma virus with deletions in this important regulatory region of the genome. Three of the mutants with large deletions, one of which had significantly altered growth properties, have been further characterized with respect to their nucleotide sequence alterations and their levels of viral DNA replication and of early protein synthesis. The nearly coincident deletions in mutants 17 and 2–19 reduce the capacity of these viruses to replicate, even in the presence of a coinfecting virus; thus they help define one boundary of the origin of DNA replication. The deletion in mutant 75 appears to remove sequences that are essential for efficient expression of early genes, but has little or no effect upon DNA replication. Its defect is complemented in trans by wild-type virus. All three mutants eliminate sequences which are candidates for RNA polymerase and ribosome binding sites near the initiation codon for early proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1486269928,"The regulatory role of phosphorylation of adrenal proteins as it relates to the mechanism of action of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has been studied. ACTH, cyclic AMP, or cyclic GMP were added to rat adrenal quarters which had been preincubated with [32P]phosphate. 32P-labeled proteins in subcellular fractions were identified after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The addition of ACTH consistently resulted in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific adrenal proteins and produced characteristic phosphorylation patterns (autoradiographs) for each subcellular fraction which were very different from control. The changes in phosphorylation of proteins preceded corticosterone production. Also, the degree of phosphorylation of these specific proteins followed a dose-response relationship with ACTH which correlated well to the dose-response for corticosterone production. When cAMP was added to adrenal quarters, the resulting phosphorylation changes were identical to those induced by ACTH. When cGMP was added to adrenal quarters, the resulting phosphorylation patterns were very similar to those produced by control incubations. ACTH or cAMP stimulated corticosterone production 6-fold when compared to control or cGMP-treated tissue. These results suggest that tropic action of ACTH is mediated by cAMP by both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific adrenal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1608913961,"Abstract Two proteins exhibiting Hpa II methylase activity have been purified to homogeneity from Haemophilus parainfluenzae and their physical and catalytic properties have been studied. Separation of the two Hpa II methylase activities was achieved by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography. In subsequent steps, each methylase was purified separately by chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, phosphocellulose, and hydroxylapatite. The proteins have molecular weights of 38,500 +/- 1,000 (Hpa II) and 41,500 +/- 1,000 (Hpa II') as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses of the native proteins yield molecular weights of 38,800 +/- 3,000 and 42,200 +/- 3,000 for Hpa II and Hpa II', respectively, indicating that both enzymes are composed of a single subunit. Furthermore, both methylases exhibit identical specificity in the methylation of the nucleotide sequence dC-C-G-G in simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA and in a short synthetic oligonucleotide duplex. Although pH, temperature, and salt optima are the same for both enzymes, homogeneous Hpa II' methylase is more stable than Hpa II methylase. Preliminary peptide mapping indicates that the two enzymes are structurally related, suggesting the possibility that Hpa II' methylase may represent a precursor form of Hpa II methylase."
https://openalex.org/W1655200277,"The conformation of cytochrome c in solution is believed to change depending on the oxidation-reduction state of the heme iron, since ferri- and ferrocytochrome c exhibit several different physicochemical properties, but so far it is unknown if the conformational difference(s) is (are) confined to a particular part or domain of the molecule. We have therefore applied the method of differential chemical modification (Bosshard, H. R. (1979) Methods Biochem. Anal. 25, 273-304) to compare the chemical reactivity toward acetic anhydride of the 19 lysine residues of ferri- and ferrocytochrome c from horse heart. The epsilon-amino groups of the spatially related residues 39, 53, and 55 were significantly less reactive in ferrocytochrome c as compared to their reactivity in ferricytochrome c. The difference of reactivity was pH-dependent and was shown to be due to an increase of the pK values of the three epsilon-amino groups in ferrocytochrome c. These results indicate a local conformational change on the surface of the cytochrome c molecule in an area to the lower left of and below the heme cleft (standard front view of the molecule facing the exposed edge of the prosthetic group). The local conformational change might be instrumental in the cytochrome c-mediated electron shuttle between cytochrome c1 and a in the final segment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain."
https://openalex.org/W1494138949,"A protein that binds tightly to single-stranded but not to double-strained nucleic acids has been purified to homogeneity from a high salt wash of ribosomes from cryptobiotic Artemia saline gastrulae. The protein, designated HD40 to indicate a helix-destabilizing protein with a molecular weight of 40,000, is present in the high-salt ribosomal wash at a level of about 2 molecules per 80 S ribosome. The protein is monomeric at salt concentrations from 0.01 to 0.5 M and has an alpha-helix content of approximately 15%. The amino acid composition of HD40 is characterized by a high glycine content (19.5 mol%), the absence of cysteine, and the presence of the unusual amino acid dimethylarginine. The isolated protein binds preferentially to natural RNA over denatured DNA. HD40 inhibits protein synthesis directed by poly(rU) and by Artemia poly(A+) RNA in cell-free systems derived from Artemia and from wheat germ; inhibition is relieved by excess of mRNA. Single-stranded ribo- and deoxyribopolynucleotides are largely protected from degradation by nucleases when complexed with HD40."
https://openalex.org/W1500670957,"As an approach to understand how the expression of globin genes are regulated during development, clones containing globin DNA sequences were selected from a recombinant library of goat genomic DNA. The type of globin gene present in each of the recombinants was determined by cross-hybridization to the DNA of mouse alpha- and beta-globin cDNA-containing plasmids. Of 11 clones isolated, eight hybridized specifically to the DNA of the mouse beta-globin plasmid, while one clone hybridized only to the DNA of the alpha globin plasmid. The location of each globin sequence within its DNA insert was determined by a combination of restriction enzyme mapping and Southern transfer-hybridizations. Selected fragments were sequenced; comparisons of the amino acids coded for by these regions with those of the goat globins identified clones carrying beta A-, beta C-, and gamma-globin genes. Another recombinant coded for amino acid sequences resembling, but not identical with, the known goat globins, and was identified tentatively as containing an embryonic or epsilon-gene. Detailed analysis of the clone containing the beta C gene and an overlapping clone revealed that three other beta-like sequences are located 6, 12, and 21 kilobases on the 5'-side of the beta C gene. The globin sequence of the locus nearest to the beta C gene has an altered translation termination codon and, if transcribed and translated, would give a globin chain seven amino acids longer than the normal goat beta C-globin. In addition, the sequence following this termination codon is very AT-rich, unlike that of other globin genes. The recombinants described contain extensive regions of DNA surrounding the globin genes, making them useful for identifying regulatory sequences as well as determining the sequence organization of the goat globin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1552269101,"A helix-destabilizing protein, HD40 (Mr 40,000), isolated from the cytoplasm of Artemia salina (Marvil, D.K., Nowak, L., and Szer, W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6466-6472) stoichiometrically disrupts the secondary structures of synthetic single-stranded and helical polynucleotides (e.g. poly(rA), poly(dA), poly(rC), poly(dC), and poly(rU)) as well as those of natural polynucleotides (e.g. MS2 RNA and phi X174 viral DNA). The conformations of double-stranded DNA and double- or triple-stranded synthetic polynucleotides are not affected by the protein. Formation of duplexes, e.g. poly(rA . rU), is prevented by HD40 at 25 to 50 mM but not at 100 to 140 mM NaCl. The unwinding of the residual secondary structure of RNA and DNA by HD40 is not highly cooperative and has a stoichiometry of one HD40 per 12 to 15 nucleotides. The addition of HD40 in excess of 1 molecule per 12 to 15 nucleotides results in the cooperative formation of distinct bead-like structures along the nucleic acid strand. The beads are about 20 nm in diameter with a center to center distance of about 40 nm. The appearance of the beads is not accompanied by any spectral changes (CD and UV) beyond those obtained at a stoichiometry of one HD40 molecule per 12 to 15 nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1587959675,"Human alpha-thrombin, the two (covalently linked)-chain, highly coagulant blood-clotting enzyme was compared with its noncoagulant, yet estero/amidolytically active derivative, gamma-thrombin, a three (noncovalently associated)-domain enzyme which results from two proteolytic cleavages of the coagulant a form. Studies of their denaturation behavior by Tos-Arg-OMe esterase activity, by intrinsic fluorescence, by fluorescence of active serine-directed dansyl labels, and by monitoring the ESR of a fluorosulfonylphenyl spin-labeled inhibitor clearly demonstrated the reduced stability of the noncovalently associated gamma-thrombin form. At pH 6.5, 0.75 M NaCl, gamma-thrombin unfolds in approximately 2. 1 M urea while the more stable a form denatures at approximately 4 M urea. By monitoring active serine probes (spin label or fluorescent labels), these transitions were slightly lower, 1.0 +/- 0.1 and 2.8 +/- 0.2 M urea for spin-labeled gamma- and alpha-thrombins, respectively. Similar behavior was found for the same spin-labeled derivatives in guanidine HCl with unfolding transitions of 0.4 M and 1.0 M for spin-labeled gamma- and alpha-thrombin, respectively. These differences in structural stabilization serve as a good physical diagnostic for the two thrombin species."

https://openalex.org/W1557020811,"In previous reports, we have identified cell-surface glycopeptides from mouse cerebrum (BCSG) that inhibited protein synthesis and mitosis in several cell types. When baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (a negative strand RNA virus), BCSG extensively inhibited viral protein synthesis. This inhibition was effective against both protein and glycoprotein synthesis and was independent of amino acid uptake by infected cells, synthesis of viral RNA, and degradation of viral proteins. Analysis of polyribosome profiles in uninfected BHK-21 cells indicated that the degree of cellular protein synthesis inhibition could not be attributed to activation of RNase or solely to a disruption of chain initiation. When added directly to a cell-free protein-synthesizing system derived from BHK-21 cells, BCSG was ineffective, but if the inhibitory material was first allowed to react with cells, cell-free protein synthesis was substantially reduced. When BCSG were reacted with cells for 5 min at 0 degrees C, the cells tested, BHK-21 (a BCSG-sensitive line) and murine fibrosarcoma 2237 (a BCSG-insensitive line), both effectively adsorbed the inhibitor from the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1536205212,"We have extensively purified from Krebs II ascites cells, although not until homogeneity, a ribonuclease which preferentially cleaves natural or synthetic double-stranded RNA substrates (RNase D); this specificity is also supported by its sensitivity to inhibition by 10(-5) M ethidium bromide. It does not degrade RNA-DNA hybrids and is, therefore, clearly distinct from previously characterized RNases H (Cathala, G., Rech, J., Huet, J., and Jeanteur, Ph. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7354-7361). It shows no requirement for a divalent cation and is inhibited by all kinds of nucleic acids regardless of their secondary structure. It acts exclusively as an endonuclease, as shown by the analysis of degradation products, and yields 5'-phosphate termini. This enzyme is able to introduce discrete nicks into purified HeLa 45 S preribosomal RNA as well as into HeLa heterogenous nuclear RNA packaged within naturally occurring nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. It is, therefore, an interesting candidate for an RNA-processing enzyme."
