https://openalex.org/W2137267461,"Lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) has been isolated from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or lymphadenopathy syndrome. Since the immune deficiency in AIDS seems to be primarily related to the defect of the helper-inducer T lymphocyte subset, the possibility that LAV is selectively tropic for this subset was investigated. Fractionation of T lymphocytes was achieved by cellular affinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies. In a hemophilic patient who was a healthy carrier of LAV, reverse transcriptase activity and virus particles detected by electron microscopy were found only in cultures of helper-inducer lymphocytes. When infected with LAV in vitro, lymphocyte subsets from normal individuals yielded similar results. Virus production was associated with impaired proliferation, modulation of T3-T4 cell markers, and the appearance of cytopathic effects. The results provide evidence for the involvement of LAV in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1570686199,"Four mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors have been prepared using EGF receptor protein from human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells as immunogen. We have determined the effect of these antibodies on two known functions of the EGF receptor: EGF binding and tyrosine kinase. Three of these antibodies (225, 528, and 579) are inhibitors of EGF binding, whereas the fourth (455) does not compete for binding but immunoprecipitates the EGF receptor. Inhibition is of the mixed competitive and noncompetitive type. The three competing monoclonal antibodies are antagonists of EGF-stimulated tyrosine protein kinase activity assayed both in intact cells and using an exogenous peptide substrate in solubilized membranes. These immunoglobulins are partial agonists in self-phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in solubilized membranes but exhibit only antagonist activity for this reaction in intact cells. The three competing monoclonal immunoglobulins recognize receptors in variant A431 cells with the same efficiency as in parental A431 cells. Such antagonist monoclonal antibodies can be used to control the concentration of receptors which can be activated by EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1531051436,"Enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate mutase have previously been found to contain phosphotyrosine in fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, which encodes a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. However, these phosphorylations are not stoichiometric, and their significance for any aspect of the transformed phenotype is unknown. We show here that enolase and lactate dehydrogenase are each phosphorylated chiefly at a single tyrosine in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells. The purified enzymes can also be phosphorylated at the same tyrosine in vitro when incubated with an immunoprecipitated retroviral transforming protein having associated tyrosine protein kinase activity. The phosphorylated tyrosine in lactate dehydrogenase is amino acid 238. The phosphorylated tyrosine in enolase lies in a sequence homologous to that surrounding histidine 43 in yeast enolase. Although the phosphorylated sequence in lactate dehydrogenase shows some homology to those sequences surrounding phosphotyrosines found in retroviral transforming proteins, the phosphorylated sequence in enolase is quite different."
https://openalex.org/W2046000758,"A strain of lymphadenopathy associated retrovirus ( LAV ) passaged in vitro was used to infect a lymphoblastoid cell line obtained by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus of B lymphocytes from a healthy donor. The virus produced from this line (B- LAV ) was also able to grow at a high rate in some other lymphoblastoid lines and in a Burkitt lymphoma line. This adapted strain retained the biochemical, ultrastructural, and antigenic characteristics of the original strain, as well as its tropism for normal T4+ lymphocytes. It is thus possible to grow LAV in large quantities that can be used for the preparation of diagnostic reagents. The interaction between such a human retrovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, a DNA virus, may have some implication for the pathology of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1608647261,"The relation between the concentration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/kinase and effects of EGF on cell proliferation has been studied using variant A431 cells and antagonist anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibodies. Clonal A431 cell variants selected for escape from the EGF-mediated growth inhibition of parental A431 cells all have reduced concentrations of EGF receptor/kinase; Harvey sarcoma virus-transformed A431 cells, which have escaped from EGF-mediated growth inhibition, also have reduced EGF receptors. Three clonal variants which have reacquired EGF-mediated growth inhibition have 2- to 4-fold more EGF receptor than their respective parent variant. A biphasic response with stimulation at low and inhibition at high concentrations of EGF was especially evident in revertants of clone 29. Three separate antagonist monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibodies block the growth inhibitory effects of EGF and uncover EGF-mediated growth stimulation. These studies indicate that in A431 cell variants a continuum of ligand-activated EGF receptors determines proliferative responses from low concentrations of active receptors under basal conditions to intermediate concentrations causing growth stimulation to high concentrations, causing inhibition of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1514543258,"Release of superoxide from human neutrophils was stimulated by cis-unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. arachidonate, linoleate). All the saturated and trans-unsaturated fatty acids tested were ineffective in this context. Binding of linoleate to neutrophils was biphasic and could be resolved into a linear and a saturable component. The extent of linoleate binding to the saturable component correlated strongly with the amount of O-2 released (r = 0.96). Palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, exhibited only linear binding to neutrophils and the binding was similar to the linear component of linoleate binding. All cis-unsaturated fatty acids tested decreased the fluorescence polarization of cis- and trans-parinaric acid used as membrane probes in suspensions of neutrophils, whereas the saturated fatty acid, myristate, increased the polarization. Fatty acids which stimulated O-2 release induced morphological changes (i.e. evaginations) in neutrophils, whereas the inactive fatty acids did not affect the cellular morphology. Effects on both the cell morphology and superoxide release were reversed by treatment of the cells with delipidated albumin. These data are discussed in relation to recent reports concerning the effects of free fatty acids on various biochemical systems."
https://openalex.org/W1597746336,"Eicosapentaenoic acid, which is a major fatty acid in fish oil, previously has been shown to competitively inhibit the cyclooxygenase-catalyzed metabolism of arachidonic acid in platelets. In the present study the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid on the production of leukotriene B via the lipoxygenase pathway in human neutrophils was examined. Eicosapentaenoate was incorporated into complex lipids of neutrophils at the same rate as arachidonate; release of the two homologous fatty acids in response to calcium ionophore A23187 was equivalent and both fatty acids were metabolized to a leukotriene B. The products derived from eicosapentaenoic acid were identified as leukotriene B5 and its stereoisomers. Eicosapentaenoate was a less favorable substrate for leukotriene B5 synthesis (94 ng/10(7) cells/5 min at 20 microM exogenous fatty acid) than arachidonate was for leukotriene B4 (401 ng under the same conditions). However, eicosapentaenoate or an oxygenated product inhibited arachidonate metabolism since at equimolar concentrations of eicosapentaenoate and arachidonate leukotriene B4 production was decreased by 68%. The inhibitory effect occurred at the level of leukotriene A hydrolase. The biological activity of eicosapentaenoate -derived products was tested; leukotriene B5 was found to have only approximately 10% of the potency of leukotriene B4 in inducing the aggregation of neutrophils, and the stereoisomers of leukotriene B5 were inactive. These data suggest that diets enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid affect neutrophils by decreasing the quantity of leukotriene B and by the production of a less potent leukotriene."
https://openalex.org/W1483243107,"Two procedures were devised to examine initial events in the glucocorticoid-regulated transcription of integrated murine mammary tumor virus (MTV) DNA sequences. First, cells in monolayer culture were exposed for brief periods to dexamethasone and then permeabilized in situ with digitonin to allow entry of 32P-labeled ribonucleoside triphosphates and measurement of transcription rates. The results revealed that the rate of MTV RNA synthesis is stimulated selectively by dexamethasone after an apparent lag of approximately equal to 1 min and is half-maximal by 8-9 min. Second, the time course of transcription elongation was monitored by quantitating in single strand nuclease protection assays the accumulation of RNA sequences from different regions of the 7.8-kilobase MTV transcription unit. These experiments suggested that the rate of MTV RNA elongation in the presence of hormone does not differ substantially from elongation rates calculated for other genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Moreover, dexamethasone increased in parallel and to the same extent the levels of RNA from various segments of the transcription unit, implying that transcripts are elongated across the MTV element at a constant rate. We conclude that glucocorticoids stimulate MTV transcription solely via a rapid and selective increase in the efficiency of transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1544564280,"Ornithine decarboxylase, the first enzyme of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, is induced by androgens in the mouse kidney. We have isolated from a kidney cDNA clone bank two plasmids, pODC1440 and pODC934 , that contain different cDNA inserts corresponding to ornithine decarboxylase mRNA. Identification was based upon the ability of plasmid-specific mRNAs to encode a 53,000-dalton polypeptide that reacts with antibody to purified mouse kidney ornithine decarboxylase. Plasmid pODC1440 hybridizes predominantly to a mRNA that is 2.1 kilobases (kb) long and is induced about 20-fold in the kidneys of female mice treated with testosterone. Plasmid pODC934 hybridizes to mRNAs of lengths 2.2 and 2.6 kb, which are induced about 8-fold by testosterone. There are probably no more than 1-2 copies of the pODC1440 -specific sequence in the mouse genome, while there may be as many as 12 copies of the pODC934 -specific sequence. That the two plasmids correspond to different ornithine decarboxylase mRNAs is suggested by two observations. First, several mouse strains express normal levels of pODC934 -specific RNA and little or no pODC1440 -specific RNA; furthermore, pODC934 -specific RNA is expressed in several tissues while pODC1440 -specific RNA is kidney-specific. Thus, androgen-mediated stimulation of kidney ornithine decarboxylase activity levels involves alterations in the concentrations of at least two distinct mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2045729297,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors were identified in rat forebrain by autoradiography with an iodine-125-labeled analog of ovine CRF substituted with norleucine and tyrosine at amino acid residues 21 and 32, respectively. High-affinity receptors for CRF were found in discrete areas of rat forebrain, including laminae I and IV of the neocortex, the external layer of the medium eminence, the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the striatum. These results are consistent with earlier findings on the immunohistochemical distribution of CRF and suggest that endogenous CRF has a physiological role in regulating activity of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1494103965,"Abstract We have used a fluorescence enhancement of actin labeled with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-actin) to study the interactions between rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin and either purified platelet gelsolin or a 130-kDa binary complex of platelet actin and gelsolin that is stable in EGTA and can be purified from human platelets. We have delineated four binding reactions. The exchange of Mg2+ for Ca2+ on the divalent cation-binding site of NBD-actin gives a small fluorescence increase. Binding of monomeric NBD-actin to the binary complex results in a 2.5-fold increase in the emission at 530 nm in the presence of Ca2+ and a 2-fold increase in the presence of EGTA. Titration experiments show that, under nonpolymerizing conditions, one additional actin is bound to the 130-kDa species to form a ternary complex. This binding is Ca2+-sensitive. Purified gelsolin does not appear to bind to NBD-actin in the presence of EGTA, as determined by fluorescence enhancement, gel filtration, or sedimentation measurements, but the addition of Ca2+ promotes rapid binding with a 1.6-1.7-fold enhancement of the emission intensity. A comparison of the relative fluorescence yields/NBD-actin molecule for a binary complex of gelsolin and one NBD-actin, a ternary complex of gelsolin and two NBD-actin molecules, and a ternary complex with an unlabeled actin in the EGTA-stable site and an NBD-actin in the second site indicates that the first NBD-actin, in the EGTA-stable site, does not give a fluorescence increase on binding but the second one does. Finally, we have demonstrated that one molecule of 45Ca2+ is trapped when the binary complex is formed and cannot be removed by EGTA. A summary model for these reactions is presented that indicates the interaction between actin and gelsolin is not a freely reversible Ca2+-controlled reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1601376839,"The regulation of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) has been examined in normal human foreskin fibroblasts (HF cells) using a fluorometric technique for continuously monitoring rapid pHi transients. We previously reported that pHi in HF cells is rapidly raised by growth factors due to activation of a Na+/H+ exchange mechanism in the plasma membrane ( Moolenaar , W. H., Tsien , R. Y., van der Saag , P. T., and de Laat , S. W. (1983) Nature (Lond.) 304, 645-648). Here we characterize the ionic basis of pHi homeostasis in quiescent HF cells. When HF cells are acid-loaded by externally applied weak acids or by pretreatment with NH4+, pHi immediately recovers toward its resting value (approximately 7.05). pHi recovery follows an exponential time course and is accompanied by enhanced Na+ influx and net H+ extrusion. Recovery of pHi and concomitant Na+/H+ fluxes are reversibly inhibited by amiloride (half-maximal effect at approximately 0.1 mM). The rate of pHi recovery from an acid load depends on external Na+ (half-maximal rate at approximately 35 mM), but is independent of external anions (HCO3-, Cl-) and is not affected by membrane depolarization. Li+ can substitute for Na+ in pHi recovery. In Na+-free media, pHi spontaneously falls to a new resting value, from which it rapidly recovers after readdition of Na+. A stepwise increase in external pH (pHo) accelerates pHi recovery from an acid load and raises the resting pHi by approximately 50% of the pHo shift. The response of pHi to alkaline pHo shifts is abolished by amiloride and by Na+ removal. It is concluded that pHi in HF cells is closely regulated by an amiloride-sensitive, reversible Na+/H+ exchanger, which is driven by the transmembrane concentration gradients for Na+ and H+. Under normal conditions, the exchanger appears to be relatively inactive, while its rate is increasingly stimulated by lowering pHi or by raising pHo."
https://openalex.org/W1816311218,"Mild trypsin treatment of isolated Neurospora mitochondria strongly inhibits their ability to bind and import the precursors of several mitochondrial proteins. Evidence is presented for two proteins, the ADP/ATP carrier and the mitochondrial porin, that specific binding of the precursors to the outer surface of the mitochondria is affected by the protease treatment. We suggest that the receptors that mediate the import of these two precursors are proteinaceous. Treatment of mitochondria with elastase also inhibits the binding and import of the ADP/ATP carrier and the porin. In contrast the import of the precursors of subunits 2 and 9 of the mitochondrial proton-translocating ATPase was unaffected by elastase treatment at the concentrations used. We suggest that the import pathways of the latter two proteins are distinct from those of the ADP/ATP carrier and the porin."
https://openalex.org/W2076893265,"Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells transformed by simian sarcoma virus (SSV) release into the culture medium a biologically active mitogen with properties identical to those of human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Like PDGF, the growth factor derived from SSV-NRK cells was shown to be stable to heat and sensitive to reducing agents. It was capable of inhibiting binding of labeled PDGF to the receptor on human fibroblasts. It also stimulated the phosphorylation of the same membrane protein (185 kilodaltons) in isolated plasma membranes from human fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins released by SSV-NRK cells showed that a 34-kilodalton protein was specifically precipitated by antiserum to PDGF. Upon reduction, this protein had a molecular size of 17 kilodaltons. PDGF has been shown to consist of two 14- to 18-kilodalton proteins linked by disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1981842293,"Avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) contains two distinct oncogenes, erbA and erbB . The erbB oncogene, which is homologous to a portion of the epidermal growth factor receptor, is related to the src family of oncogenes and efficiently transforms erythroblasts, whereas erbA potentiates the effects of erbB by blocking the differentiation of erythroblasts at an immature stage. This ""potentiator"" was sequenced; the amino acid sequence deduced from it was clearly different from the sequences of other known oncogene products and was related to carbonic anhydrases. These enzymes participate in the transport of carbon dioxide by erythrocytes, the precursors of which are main targets of avian erythroblastosis virus. A src-related oncogene such as erbB in synergy with an activated specific cell-derived gene such as erbA can profoundly affect early erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1563230397,"Radioligand binding studies identified two classes of 125I-angiotensin II-binding sites in rat liver membranes. High affinity binding sites (Kd = 0.35 +/- 0.13 nM, N = 372 +/- 69 fmol/mg of protein) were inactivated by dithiothreitol (0.1-10 mM) without any apparent change in low affinity binding sites (Kd = 3.1 +/- 0.8 nM, N = 658 +/- 112 fmol/mg of protein). Dithiothreitol inactivation was readily reversible but could be made permanent by alkylation of membrane proteins with iodoacetamide. Angiotensin II stimulation of glycogen phosphorylase in isolated rat hepatocytes (maximal stimulation 780%, EC50 = 0.4 nM) was completely inhibited by 10 mM dithiothreitol, a concentration which also abolished high affinity site binding; phosphorylase stimulation by glucagon and norepinephrine under these conditions was unaltered. Angiotensin II inhibition of glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in hepatocytes required higher angiotensin II concentrations (EC50 = 3 nM) than phosphorylase stimulation and was not affected by dithiothreitol. Fractional occupancy of high affinity binding sites by 125I-angiotensin II correlated closely with angiotensin II-mediated phosphorylase stimulation, whereas occupancy of low affinity sites paralleled inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. These data indicate that the physiologic effects of angiotensin II in rat liver are mediated by two distinct receptors, apparently not interconvertible, and provide the first evidence for angiotensin II receptor subtypes with differing biochemical features and mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W1661795249,"Contractile activity in smooth muscle cells is regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the 20,000-Da light chain of myosin. In an attempt to better understand the localization in muscle of the enzymes which catalyze the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation process, we measured the binding constants of turkey gizzard smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC) kinase and smooth muscle phosphatases (SMP) to myosin and actin under identical conditions by a sedimentation method. We have observed that MLC kinase binds strongly to both actin and myosin. When tropomyosin is complexed to actin, the affinity of MLC kinase to actin increases 2-3-fold. The presence of calcium-calmodulin weakens the binding of MLC kinase to actin, actin-tropomyosin, and myosin by about 3-fold. Increasing the ionic strength of the binding assay also decreases the binding of MLC kinase to myosin and actin-tropomyosin. MLC kinase is observed to bind to rod subfragment, a fragment of myosin which does not contain the phosphorylatable light chain suggesting that the kinase also binds to domains of the myosin other than the 20,000-Da light chain. Of the phosphatases tested, only SMP-III and -IV bind strongly to unphosphorylated myosin. When the myosin is thiophosphorylated , the binding constants of SMP-III and -IV increase dramatically. SMP-I and -II do not bind to unphosphorylated and thiophosphorylated myosin. However, the free catalytic subunit of SMP-I binds weakly to thiophosphorylated myosin. None of the phosphatases binds to actin. Our study suggests that in muscle, the myosin phosphatase is localized in the thick filament while the MLC kinase may be associated with the thick filaments, thin filaments, or even both."
https://openalex.org/W1568915656,The receptors involved in bacterial chemotaxis are post-translationally modified by specific enzymes which catalyze the deamination of glutaminyl residues and the methyl esterification and demethylation of glutamyl residues. In this work we identify the sites of these covalent modifications on the aspartate receptor from Salmonella typhimurium. These were identified using the properties of the Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease which cleaves peptide bonds following glutamyl but not glutaminyl residues. We show here that bonds following methyl-esterified glutamyl residues are also resistant to the protease. A comparison of the fragments obtained after V8 protease cleavage of methyl-esterified (or deaminated) peptides with the fragments from the corresponding unmodified peptides immediately yields the sites of modification. Three of the four methyl-esterified glutamyl residues are located near the middle of the receptor amino acid sequence; one of these is synthesized as a glutaminyl residue and is deaminated by the esterase to form a glutamyl residue. The fourth site of methyl esterification is located near the carboxyl terminus. All four sites occupy analogous positions in a well-conserved arrangement of residues which may form a binding site for the esterase and the methyltransferase.
https://openalex.org/W1490843190,"6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase from rat liver was phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP. Treatment of the 32P-labeled enzyme with thermolysin removed all of the radioactivity from the enzyme core and produced a single labeled peptide. The phosphopeptide was purified by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The sequence of the 12-amino acid peptide was found to be Val-Leu-Gln-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ser(P)-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln. Correlation of the extent of phosphorylation with activity showed that a 50% decrease in the ratio of kinase activity to bisphosphate activity occurred when only 0.25 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mol of enzyme subunit, and maximal changes occurred with 0.7 mol incorporated. The kinetics of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the native bifunctional enzyme was compared with that of other rat liver protein substrates. The Km for 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase (10 microM) was less than that for rat liver pyruvate kinase (39 microM), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (222 microM), and 6- phosphofructose -1-kinase (230 microM). Comparison of the initial rate of phosphorylation of a number of protein substrates of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase revealed that only skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase was phosphorylated more rapidly than the bifunctional enzyme. Skeletal muscle glycogen synthase, heart regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and liver pyruvate kinase were phosphorylated at rates nearly equal to that of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase, while phosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase was barely detectable. Phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was not catalyzed by any other protein kinase tested. These results are consistent with a primary role of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in regulation of the enzyme in intact liver."
https://openalex.org/W1541586041,"We have studied the interactions between gelsolin and actin in crude extracts from activated and unactivated platelets and in mixtures of purified platelet gelsolin and muscle actin. Extracts were prepared using 10 mM EGTA from human platelets treated either with 100 microM aspirin and 2.5 mM tetracaine to retard activation or with the calcium ionophore A23187 to effect activation. The extracts were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 or by sedimentation on sucrose gradients and then analyzed using anti-gelsolin immunoblots and actin filament nucleation assays. The nucleation activity in both extracts was associated with gelsolin. The activity in the extracts from unactivated platelets sedimented with an S value of 5.2 and had an Mr = 90,000. The activity in the extracts prepared with EGTA from activated platelets sedimented at 6.8 S and had an Mr = 130,000. We have shown previously that the Mr = 130,000 species is an EGTA-stable binary complex of one actin and one gelsolin. Transient exposure of the extracts from unactivated platelets to 100 microM Ca2+ and subsequent fractionation in EGTA-containing buffers demonstrated that the formation of the binary complex occurs in the presence of Ca2+. Fractionation in the presence of 100 microM Ca2+ demonstrated higher order complexes including a ternary complex with a sedimentation constant of 8.2 S and an Mr = 165,000. Sedimentation and gel filtration experiments using purified platelet gelsolin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin demonstrated that formation of the EGTA-stable binary complex required Ca2+. At least one additional actin is bound to the binary complex in the presence of Ca2+, but is not sufficiently stable to be purified when EGTA is added. The results suggest that gelsolin exists either as a monomer or perhaps as a weak complex with actin in unactivated platelets but complexes tightly with actin during the transient Ca2+ rise that occurs during activation."
https://openalex.org/W1515904479,"The intracellular site of vasopressin-induced phosphoinositide breakdown in rat hepatocytes was investigated. After 45 s of vasopressin treatment of hepatocytes prelabeled with 32Pi, the levels of 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-P2) in the plasma membrane decreased by approximately 40%, then gradually returned to near control levels after 10 min of treatment. Only small changes in the levels of [32P] PI-P and [32P]PI-P2 were observed in the other subcellular fractions, and were attributed to contamination of these fractions by plasma membranes. The level of 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol in the plasma membrane decreased by 15% after 45 s of vasopressin treatment and then increased above control levels at later times while 32P-labeled phosphatidic acid levels in the plasma membrane gradually increased to 2-fold greater than control after 5 min of treatment. Using 32P-labeled plasma membranes obtained from prelabeled hepatocytes, it was found that PI-P and PI-P2 were rapidly degraded by a calcium-dependent polyphosphoinositide-specific phosphodiesterase. The enzyme was activated by physiological concentrations (200 nM) of free calcium when assayed at low ionic strength, but the calcium requirement shifted to micromolar concentrations under isosmotic, intracellular-like, ionic conditions. Addition of vasopressin (200 nM) to the 32P-labeled plasma membranes stimulated the breakdown of 20% of the [32P]PI-P2 present in the plasma membranes in 1 min when assayed under isosmotic conditions in the presence of 2 nM MgCl2 and approximately 200 nM free calcium. This suggests that the phosphoinositide-specific phosphodiesterase is not active under normal cellular conditions, but is activated upon the addition of vasopressin to the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W2073178379,The pathophysiology of brain dysfunction was studied with an animal model of chronic alcoholism. Rats were fed a liquid diet with or without ethanol for 20 weeks and then the diet without ethanol for three more weeks. Hippocampal slices were prepared and intracellular recordings were obtained from dentate granule and CA1 cells. Significant depression of orthodromically elicited inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and postspike afterhyperpolarizations was observed in neurons from ethanol-exposed animals. No differences were observed in other active or passive membrane characteristics. These results suggest that a loss of neuronal inhibition could contribute to brain dysfunction in chronic alcoholism.
https://openalex.org/W2093426070,"Iontophoretic injection of phosphorylase kinase, a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, increased input resistance, enhanced the long-lasting depolarization component of the light response, and reduced the early transient outward K+ current, IA, and the late K+ currents, IB, in type B photoreceptors of Hermissenda crassicornis in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Since behavioral and biophysical studies have shown that similar membrane changes persist after associative conditioning, these results suggest that Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation could mediate the long-term modulation of specific K+ channels as a step in the generation of a conditioned behavioral change."
https://openalex.org/W1517984486,"The DNA sequence of two overlapping cDNA clones and a genomic lambda clone covering the region coding for 288 amino acids at the COOH terminus of the chicken type II procollagen gene is reported. This region consists of 4 exons coding for the last 15 amino acids of the triple helical domain and 273 amino acids which correspond to the COOH-terminal telopeptide and COOH-terminal propeptide. The sequence, base composition, and codon usage of this region of the type II procollagen gene show particularly high similarity to those of the chicken alpha 1(I) procollagen gene and differ from those of the alpha 2(I) and alpha 1(III) gene sequences. Two DNA tracts of low sequence similarity were observed. One of these regions spans the telopeptide and COOH-terminal propeptidase cleavage site, although 4-5 amino acids at the actual cleavage site are conserved compared with the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) genes. A region of unusually high nucleotide sequence conservation is present in exon 2 (amino acids 171c - 186c ) consisting of approximately 45 nucleotides with only one or two base substitutions compared with the other procollagen genes. Within this conserved sequence is a site for carbohydrate attachment. The 3' nontranslated sequence of the type II procollagen mRNA is longer than that of either the alpha 1(I) or alpha 2(I) mRNA and contains several unusual long tracts consisting primarily of one or two bases. Although the canonical site for polyadenylation is not present, two related sequences, AACAAA and ATATAAA , are present 32 and 41 bases preceding the end of the major RNA species. The exon/intron structure of the type II procollagen gene is similar to that of other collagen genes which have been described. This DNA sequence provides the first extensive report of the amino acid sequence of chicken type II procollagen."

Both SV40 and azoxymethane altered a number of phenotypic characteristics of the normal human colon cells, including their morphology, culture longevity, growth in soft agar, substrate adherence, and peanut agglutinin binding. The SV40 transformants synthesized intranuclear T antigen. These data indicate that normal human colon mucosal cells were transformed toward the malignant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1597379321,"Isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated with 32Pi for various times and then fractionated into plasma membranes, mitochondria, nuclei, lysosomes, and microsomes by differential centrifugation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation. The phospholipids were isolated and deacylated by mild alkaline treatment. The glycerophosphate esters were separated by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography and assayed for radioactivity. It was found that plasma membranes, mitochondria, nuclei, lysosomes, and microsomes displayed similar rates of 32P incorporation into the major phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid. This suggests that the phospholipids of these organelles are undergoing rapid turnover and replacement with newly synthesized phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the plasma membrane fraction incorporated 32P into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (DPI) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (TPI) at rates 5-10 and 25-50 times, respectively, faster than any of the other subcellular fractions. Although the plasma membrane is the primary site of 32P incorporation into DPI and TPI, this study also demonstrates that significant incorporation of 32P into DPI occurs in other subcellular sites, especially lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1638584560,"Using spin stabilization, ESR measurements have been made of o-semiquinone production from the horseradish peroxidase-H2O2 oxidation of catecholamine substrates. The termination rate constant for semiquinones stabilized with Zn2+ at pH 5 is about 10(4) times smaller than for uncomplexed semiquinones at neutral pH. Stabilization allows steady state concentrations of semiquinones to be obtained. The duration of the steady state is dependent upon the concentrations of enzyme, hydrogen peroxide, and catecholamine substrate. The relative reactivity of the substrates 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, norepinephrine, and dopamine at pH 5 is 1:8:40. The effects of phenol and ascorbate were studied and shown to be consistent with scavenging of phenoxyl radicals by catecholamine and semiquinone radicals by ascorbate, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1502399694,"Activated neutrophils aggregate, generate superoxide (O-2), and degranulate. The role of Ca as second messenger in neutrophil activation was examined using as agonist the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe and its antagonist t-butoxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe to systematically vary the time of receptor occupancy. Release of enzymes from specific and azurophil granules showed a finite requirement for receptor occupancy; the cells were committed to full degranulation after 10 s of receptor-agonist interaction. In contrast, continuous occupation of the receptor by agonist was required to initiate and maintain O-2 generation and aggregation. Cytosolic Ca ( Quin2 fluorescence) increased immediately in response to fMet-Leu-Phe, requiring less than 2 s of agonist-receptor interaction to initiate an optimal response. Mobilization of membrane-associated Ca (chlorotetracycline fluorescence) also demonstrated a finite time requirement; the cells were fully committed after 10 s of agonist-receptor interaction. Increased Ca permeability (45Ca uptake) was fully launched after 15 s of agonist-receptor interaction. The data indicate that Ca movements ( quin2 , chlorotetracycline fluorescence, 45Ca uptake) are both necessary and sufficient to account for degranulation by neutrophils activated by fMet-Leu-Phe. However, neutrophil aggregation and the generation and release of O-2 in response to the same stimulus require a further unknown factor(s) associated with receptor occupancy to maintain these responses."
https://openalex.org/W1585715077,"We have studied the effects of inhibiting the initial steps in processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on the formation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Our data show that conditions which prevent the removal of glucose can block the growth of this virus. Our conclusion that inhibition of VSV synthesis is due specifically to an effect on the ability of the virus glycoprotein, G, to mature to a correct functional conformation is based on the following observations: (i) two drugs, deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine , both of which selectively inhibit the processing glucosidases, affected virus growth; (ii) only one of the two strains (San Juan and Orsay ) of VSV tested was affected and that strain, VSV(San Juan), is known to have a G protein highly sensitive to alterations in oligosaccharide structure; (iii) the effect was to make the formation of VSV(San Juan) temperature-sensitive, a result previously observed with alterations in the oligosaccharides on G protein; (iv) a cell variant missing glucosidase II activity also became temperature-sensitive in its ability to produce VSV(San Juan) but not VSV( Orsay ). Although inhibition of glucosidase activity by 1- deoxynojirimycin caused a 10-fold drop in virion formation, transport of G protein to the plasma membrane was not altered. The growth of VSV(San Juan) at 40 degrees C was not affected when subsequent steps in the processing pathway were blocked. These data indicate that by the time the glucose residues are removed G has attained a stable conformation."

https://openalex.org/W1547921937,"Interactions of eukaryotic 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) from rabbit reticulocytes and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ), Met-tRNAf, GTP, and GDP were monitored by changes in fluorescence anisotropy and radioactive filtration assays. At 1 mM Mg2+, radioactive filtration assays demonstrate that GEF is necessary for nucleotide exchange. We did not observe a GDP dependence in the association reaction of eIF-2 X GEF for GDP concentrations from 0.01 to 20 microM. This is in disagreement with the model: eIF-2 X GDP + GEF in equilibrium eIF-2 X GEF + GDP. The addition of GTP caused a decrease in fluorescence anisotropy which is interpreted as a dissociation of eIF-2 X GEF . We propose an asymmetrical model of ternary complex (eIF-2 X GTP X Met-tRNAf) formation where 1) GDP does not displace GEF and 2) GTP replaces GEF and presumably GDP. For reticulocyte eIF-2, phosphorylation of the alpha subunit greatly inhibits protein synthesis. This inhibition derives neither from failure of GEF to bind to eIF-2(alpha P) nor from greatly enhanced binding of GEF . The inhibition results from the requirement of very high levels of GTP (100 microM) to dissociate the eIF-2(alpha P) X GEF complex."

Four Mr species (Mr = 70,000, 95,000, 135,000, and 145,000) are detected when cells are subjected to a brief pulse of L-[35S]methionine; an Mr = 165,000 species is detected after 45-60 min of exposure of cells to radiolabel. In pulse-chase experiments, the four lower Mr species appear to bear a precursor relation to the Mr = 165,000 protein.

https://openalex.org/W1494849067,"Abstract During treatment of primary cultured hepatocytes with either glucagon or isoproterenol for several hours, the stimulations of cAMP formation by these hormones decreased time dependently. Glucagon treatment also reduced the response to isoproterenol, but isoproterenol treatment did not decrease the response to glucagon. Treatment with isoproterenol caused more rapid desensitization than treatment with glucagon. Assays of glucagon and beta-adrenergic receptors showed that the receptor number of only the hormone with which the cells were treated decreased and that dissociation constants of the receptors did not change. Moreover, in glucagon-desensitized cells, the effect of GTP on competition of the bindings of antagonist and agonist for the beta-adrenergic receptor did not change. After treatment with isoproterenol, stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by the agonist was decreased without any decrease in the stimulations of activity by other effectors. In contrast, glucagon treatment greatly decreased the stimulations of activity by glucagon, isoproterenol, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and slightly decreased that by fluoride. However, after glucagon treatment, the cells showed normal responses to cholera toxin of activation of adenylate cyclase and ADP-ribosylation of guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (Ns). The maximal response of glucagon-treated cells to forskolin was about two-thirds that of untreated cells and this treatment also impaired the shift toward a low Kact value for forskolin observed in the presence of either glucagon or isoproterenol. These results indicate that isoproterenol caused homologous desensitization consisting of only a down regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor, whereas glucagon caused heterologous desensitization, mainly by alteration of the Ns component, as well as down regulation of glucagon receptor. This altered Ns seems to be coupled normally to the beta-adrenergic receptor, but to have impaired coupling to the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1580787869,"Regulation of cellular Ca2+ movements by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors has been studied using 45Ca2+ flux techniques in monolayer cultures of intact BC3H-1 cells. Unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux from BC3H-1 cells reveals multiphasic kinetics, with a major fraction of cellular Ca2+ residing in a slowly exchanging intracellular compartment. Stimulation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors by the agonist phenylephrine substantially increases 45Ca2+ unidirectional efflux, accompanied by a far smaller increase in 45Ca2+ influx. The selective enhancement of 45Ca2+ unidirectional efflux upon alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation results in a net 30-40% decline in total cell Ca2+ content, measured either by radioisotopic equilibrium techniques or by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The relatively large pool of Ca2+ responsive to alpha-adrenergic stimulation is not displaced by La3+ but can be depleted with the Ca2+ ionophore A-23187. These results indicate that alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation predominantly mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores, together with a much smaller increase in transmembrane Ca2+ permeability. This interpretation is supported by comparative 45Ca2+ flux studies using a sister clone of BC3H-1 cells possessing surface nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but no alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Agonist stimulation of the cholinergic receptor opens a well characterized transmembrane ion permeability gate. Cholinergic receptor activation greatly enhances the observed 45Ca2+ unidirectional influx relative to efflux, leading to net elevation of cellular Ca2+ content as Ca2+ moves down its inwardly directed concentration gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1557962201,"The major nucleocapsid protein of avian retroviruses, pp12, preferentially binds to the single-stranded regions of 60 S viral RNA with a apparent binding constant (Kapp) of 1.2 X 10(11) M-1. If the phosphate associated with serine residues of pp12 is hydrolyzed by either alkali treatment or with partially purified phosphoprotein phosphatase activities isolated from virions, the Kapp for binding to 60 S RNA decreases 100-fold. The high affinity binding of pp12 to viral RNA can be restored by phosphorylation of the protein with a protein kinase, protease-activated kinase I. The same serine residues phosphorylated in vivo are phosphorylated by protease kinase I in vitro. These residues have been identified as serine residues 40 and either 76 or 77. The protein purified from virions is phosphorylated primarily at serine residue 40 (greater than 90%). This suggests that phosphoserine residue 40 is responsible for modulating the binding of the protein to RNA. Thus, the phosphorylation state of pp12 can be reversibly altered in vitro resulting in the interconversion of the protein between a state of high and low affinity for single-stranded viral RNA."

Pure bovine renal (Na,K)-ATPase was modified by H2O2 in 150 mM KCl and 20 mM MgCl2 to yield an enzyme with kinetic properties similar to the enzyme isolated from the H2O2-treated, cultured bovine lens. H2O2 modification changes the interaction of the ATP hydrolysis site from negative to positive kinetic cooperativity.

https://openalex.org/W1481706299,"A high molecular weight protein phosphatase (phosphatase H-II) was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. The enzyme had a Mr = 260,000 as determined by gel filtration and possessed two types of subunit, of Mr = 70,000 and 35,000, respectively, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On ethanol treatment, the enzyme was dissociated to an active species of Mr = 35,000. The purified phosphatase dephosphorylated lysine-rich histone, phosphorylase a, glycogen synthase, and phosphorylase kinase. It dephosphorylated both the alpha- and beta-subunit phosphates of phosphorylase kinase, with a preference for the dephosphorylation of the alpha-subunit phosphate over the beta-subunit phosphate of phosphorylase kinase. The enzyme also dephosphorylated p-nitrophenyl phosphate at alkaline pH. Phosphatase H-II is distinct from the major phosphorylase phosphatase activities in the muscle extracts. Its enzymatic properties closely resemble that of a Mr = 33,500 protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase C-II) isolated from the same tissue. However, despite their similarity of enzymatic properties, the Mr = 35,000 subunit of phosphatase H-II is physically different from phosphatase C-II as revealed by their different sizes on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. On trypsin treatment of the enzyme, this subunit is converted to a form which is a similar size to phosphatase C-II."

The complete nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein were elucidated. The protein sequence was compared to some related serine proteases. This comparison supports the notion that several serine proteases suggested to be involved in the processing of precursors to polypeptide hormones and growth factors are closely related to each other. It appears that these proteases are descendants of a common ancestral gene and thus form a distinct subfamily among the serine proteases.
https://openalex.org/W88984689,"A host protein, which is required for the replication of a plasmid DNA (pLA1), has been purified from extracts of uninfected HeLa nuclei. This plasmid DNA contains the origin of adenovirus DNA replication but lacks the 55,000-dalton terminal proteins. The purified host protein has been designated factor pL. Factor pL is essential for the initiation of DNA replication of EcoRI-digested pLA1 DNA, which proceeds via the formation of a covalent complex between the 80,000-dalton adenovirus coded preterminal protein and 5' dCMP. Factor pL has been purified approximately 120-fold to greater than 75% homogeneity. It is a heat labile and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein with a native Mr = 39,000 (+/- 2,000). Initiation of DNA replication using EcoRI-digested pLA1 DNA as the template requires the 80,000-dalton preterminal protein and the 140,000-dalton adenovirus DNA polymerase, in addition to factor pL, and is stimulated as much as 10-fold by nuclear factor I ( Nagata , K., Guggenheimer , R. A., Enomoto , T., Lichy , J. H., and Hurwitz , J. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6438-6442).

https://openalex.org/W1577204398,"alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors are members of an important class of membrane-bound receptors which appear to mediate physiologic responses by decreasing the activity of the regulatory enzyme adenylate cyclase. This report describes the first direct indentification of the subunit-binding site of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors from human platelets were solubilized with 1% digitonin and were purified approximately 600-fold by repetitive affinity chromatography. In saturation and competition binding studies using [3H]yohimbine the original alpha 2-adrenergic characteristics were retained by the partially purified receptor, i.e. the following potency series (based on Ki values) was obtained: phentolamine approximately equal to yohimbine much greater than prazosin and (-)epinephrine greater than (+)epinephrine. Phenoxybenzamine was found to have a Ki for the partially purified alpha 2-adrenergic receptor of 108 nM. As judged by the loss of specific [3H]yohimbine binding, phenoxybenzamine (a known alkylating agent) was found to bind irreversibly to the partially purified alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. Using [3H]phenoxybenzamine, covalent labeling of proteins in the partially purified receptor preparation was obtained. Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, a specifically labeled peptide with a relative molecular mass of 61,000 was visualized. Irreversible labeling of this peptide by [3H]phenoxybenzamine could be prevented with either phentolamine or (-)epinephrine, but not with prazosin or (+)epinephrine, suggesting that this peptide of Mr = 61,000 represents the major subunit binding site of the human platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1591268781,"Rates of production of p-nitrophenyl glucuronide by isolated perfused livers from fed or fasted phenobarbital-treated rats were estimated by monitoring the concentration of glucuronide in the effluent perfusate. Infusion of epinephrine decreased the steady state level of p-nitrophenyl glucuronide by about 39% (half-maximal inhibition at approximately 5 microM). This result was unexpected because epinephrine activated glycogenolysis and elevated hepatic UDP-glucuronic acid contents. The effect of epinephrine can be attributed to its interaction with alpha-adrenergic receptors, since the inhibition of glucuronide production by epinephrine was reversed by an alpha-antagonist (phentolamine) but not by a beta-antagonist, propranolol. Since alpha-adrenergic agonists increase the cytosolic free calcium concentration, we investigated the possibility that the decrease in glucuronide production elicited by epinephrine was mediated by calcium. Removal of calcium from the perfusion fluid diminished the inhibition of glucuronide production by epinephrine, while increasing extracellular calcium from 0 to 150 microM restored the inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of extracellular calcium, glucuronide production was inhibited by the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 or angiotensin II, a hormone which increases cytosolic calcium. Concentrations of ionized calcium comparable to physiological intracellular levels (0.1-2 microM) increased microsomal beta-glucuronidase activity by 50 to 100% but had no effect on microsomal glucuronosyl-transferases . These results indicate that activation of hepatic alpha-adrenergic receptors increases cytosolic calcium which stimulates microsomal beta-glucuronidase activity. This decreases net glucuronide formation by the liver. In support of this hypothesis, rates of glucuronide production were unaffected by epinephrine in perfused livers from beta-glucuronidase-deficient C3H/HeJ mice."

https://openalex.org/W1545255155,"An in vitro system which replicates plasmid DNA containing the replication origin of adenovirus DNA has been established. Replication of plasmid pLA1 DNA, which contains the left-hand terminus (0-9.4 map units) of adenovirus serotype 5 DNA but which lacks the 55,000-dalton terminal protein, is initiated by a protein-primed mechanism in a manner similar to that found with adenovirus DNA. Initiation of DNA replication using plasmid pLA1 as a template requires (i) that the cloned adenovirus sequence be present at the terminus of a linearized (form III) DNA molecule ( Tamanoi , F., and Stillman , B. W. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 79, 2221-2225; van Bergen, B. G. M., van der Ley , P. A., van Driel , W., van Mansfield , A. D. M., and van der Vliet , P. A.

In the presence of the four deoxy-nucleoside triphosphates, the preterminal protein, the adenovirus coded DNA binding protein, and an extract prepared from uninfected HeLa nuclei, the adenovirus DNA polymerase can elongate the preterminal-protein dCMP initiation complex formed on pLA1 DNA to full length (6.6 kilobase) DNA molecules.

https://openalex.org/W1487127361,"Abstract Prior to ingrowth of the vagus nerve (4-5 days in ovo), embryonic chick hearts are relatively unresponsive to muscarinic stimulation ( Pappano , A. J. (1977) Pharmacol. Rev. 29, 3-33). We studied the correlation between the development of physiologic responsiveness in the embryonic chick heart and changes in the properties of muscarinic receptors. In cultures from hearts 10 days in ovo, muscarinic agonists decreased beating rate by 15% and increased the rate of K+ efflux by 35%. In cultures of embryonic hearts 3 1/2 days in ovo, muscarinic receptors had no effect on beating rate and mediated only an 11% increase in the rate of K+ efflux. We previously demonstrated that in cells cultured from hearts 10 days in ovo, 26% of receptors bound agonist with a high affinity (RH) and that incubation with guanine nucleotides mediated the conversion of RH to a low affinity form (RL ( Galper , J. B., Dziekan , L. C., O' Hara , D. S., and Smith, T. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 237, 10344-10356]. In cultures of hearts 3 1/2 days in ovo, RH constituted 52% of total [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate-binding sites, and guanine nucleotides had no effect on the conversion of RH to RL. Growth of cells cultured from hearts 3 1/2 days in ovo in medium supplemented with specific lots of serum resulted in a 3-fold increase (from 11 to 30%) in the ability of muscarinic agonists to increase K+ permeability. This increased sensitivity to muscarinic stimulation was accompanied by a 20% increase in RH and sensitivity of 75% of RH to guanine nucleotides. Thus, enhanced number of RH and development of guanine nucleotide responsiveness are associated with the development of a physiologic response. The relationship of these developmental changes to the appearance of a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594815865,"Abstract A clonal line of murine Leydig tumor cells (MLTC-1) bound both human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and cholera toxin (CT) with high affinity and accumulated cyclic AMP in response to either effector. The major cellular ganglioside was GM3 with small amounts of GM2, GM1, and GD1a. The gangliosides became labeled when the cells were grown in medium containing [3H] galactose or were exposed to galactose oxidase or NaIO4 followed by NaB3H4. CT specifically protected GM1 from surface labeling whereas hCG did not protect any gangliosides from being labeled. When the cells were exposed to sialidase, surface GD1a was eliminated, and GM1 increased with a corresponding increase in CT binding. When sialidase-treated cells were first incubated with the B component of CT, binding and action of CT was blocked. The cells, however, retained their ability to bind and respond to hCG. Addition of purified gangliosides to the medium effectively inhibited the binding and action of CT but not hCG. The cells incorporated the exogenous gangliosides and exhibited increased binding of and responsiveness to CT but not hCG. Both hCG- and CT-receptor complexes were extracted from the cells with nonionic detergent and analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The hCG-receptor complex had an apparent molecular weight of 190,000 whereas the CT-receptor complex sedimented only slightly faster than CT itself. MLTC-1 gangliosides were separated on thin layer chromatograms which were overlayed with either iodinated CT or hCG. The toxin bound to a ganglioside corresponding to GM1 whereas the hormone did not bind to any of the gangliosides. When the cells were incubated overnight with hCG, they lost their hCG receptors but exhibited an increase in CT binding and gangliosides. Our results indicate that GM1 is the specific receptor for CT whereas gangliosides are not involved in the binding and action of hCG."
https://openalex.org/W2125659233,"Elucidating the mechanism by which insulin inhibits lipolysis has been hampered by the unavailability of a broken cell preparation in which the intact cell responses to the hormone could be duplicated. Here we report, using digitonin-permeabilized rat adipocytes, that physiological concentrations of insulin inhibit cyclic AMP-activated lipolysis despite the absence of cytosolic and plasma membrane integrity. Cyclic AMP (1.0 mM) maximally activates lipolysis in permeabilized adipocytes greater than 10-fold. Insulin inhibits this activation in a biphasic manner with maximum inhibition of 59 +/- 8% (N = 7) at 10(-9) M. At the submaximal concentrations of cyclic AMP (1.0 to 10 microM), insulin (10(-9) M) inhibits lipolysis 80 to 90%. Additionally, the antilipolytic effect of insulin is rapid (3 min) and it is specific, with the relatively inactive desoctapeptide analogue of insulin being three orders of magnitude less inhibitory than native insulin. In contrast to permeabilized cells, intact cells demonstrate only a small lipolytic response to cyclic AMP which is insensitive to insulin. These findings suggest the following about insulin's antilipolytic effects: 1) an intact cell is not required; 2) the intracellular mechanism of action does not require physiological concentrations of the freely diffusible cytosolic components; and 3) a site of insulin action independent of adenylate cyclase may play a major role."

https://openalex.org/W1551847012,"The kinetic mechanism of choline kinase associated with both the cytosolic and membrane fractions of synaptosomes isolated from rat striata was studied. The velocity of choline kinase was measured using various concentrations of MgATP at several concentrations of uncomplexed Mg2+ and a single concentration of choline. This experiment was repeated using different concentrations of choline. Analysis of these data according to a terreactant mechanism indicates that MgATP binds in rapid equilibrium prior to Mg2+, but the binding of MgATP and choline is random. Product inhibition by phosphorylcholine was noncompetitive versus both choline and MgATP. Hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), an analog of choline and competitive inhibitor of the sodium-dependent high affinity choline transport system, was noncompetitive versus choline and uncompetitive versus MgATP at high levels of Mg2+. However, when the concentration of Mg2+ was decreased below the KMg2 +, HC-3 was noncompetitive versus MgATP. Thiocholine, another analog of choline, gave slope-linear intercept hyperbolic inhibition versus choline. Mg-5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, an analog of MgATP, was competitive versus MgATP and noncompetitive versus choline. Virtually identical results were obtained using either soluble or particulate forms of choline kinase from rat striata. All data are consistent with the mechanism suggested by initial velocity studies alone and additionally suggest that the release of MgADP is slow, occurs last, and may limit the overall rate of the reaction."
