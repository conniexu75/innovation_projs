https://openalex.org/W2058538904,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States, with estimates of 4 million HCV-infected individuals in the United States and 170 million worldwide. Most (70-80%) HCV infections persist and about 30% of individuals with persistent infection develop chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Epidemiological, viral and host factors have been associated with the differences in HCV clearance or persistence, and studies have demonstrated that a strong host immune response against HCV favours viral clearance. Thus, variation in genes involved in the immune response may contribute to the ability to clear the virus. In a recent genome-wide association study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12979860) 3 kilobases upstream of the IL28B gene, which encodes the type III interferon IFN-3, was shown to associate strongly with more than a twofold difference in response to HCV drug treatment. To determine the potential effect of rs12979860 variation on outcome to HCV infection in a natural history setting, we genotyped this variant in HCV cohorts comprised of individuals who spontaneously cleared the virus (n = 388) or had persistent infection (n = 620). We show that the C/C genotype strongly enhances resolution of HCV infection among individuals of both European and African ancestry. To our knowledge, this is the strongest and most significant genetic effect associated with natural clearance of HCV, and these results implicate a primary role for IL28B in resolution of HCV infection."

It is unclear what happens to the autophagy activity in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. In this study, we examined the autophagy activity in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia and the associated mechanism. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia were induced in mice by a high fat diet, followed by measurements of autophagy markers. Our results show that autophagy was suppressed in the livers of mice with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Transcript levels of some key autophagy genes were also suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Conversely, autophagy activity was increased in the livers of mice with streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency. Levels of vps34, atg12, and gabarapl1 transcripts were elevated in the livers of mice with insulin deficiency. To study the mechanism, autophagy was induced by nutrient deprivation or glucagon in cultured hepatocytes in the presence or absence of insulin. Autophagy activity and transcript levels of vps34, atg12, and gabarapl1 genes were reduced by insulin. The effect of insulin was largely prevented by overexpression of the constitutive nuclear form of FoxO1. Importantly, autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy) in cultured cells was suppressed by insulin in the presence of insulin resistance. Together, our results show that autophagy activity and expression of some key autophagy genes were suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin suppression of autophagy involves FoxO1-mediated transcription of key autophagy genes. Autophagy is essential for maintaining both survival and health of cells.

Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a catabolic process whereby long lived large molecules and cellular organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumHFDhigh fat dietmtROSmitochondrion-derived reactive oxygen speciesmtDNAmitochondrial DNANDnormal rodent chow dietSTZstreptozotocinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEBSSEarle's balanced salt solutionQUICKIquantitative insulin sensitivity check indexHOMAhomeostasis model assessmentT1DMtype1 diabetes mellitus. are degraded by lysosomes for an alternative energy source during starvation (1Yin X.M.

Ding W.X. Gao W. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1773-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but inhibited by amino acids and/or insulin through the mTOR- or/and Akt-dependent pathways after food intake (3Arsham A.M.

Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Thus, autophagy activity fluctuates with food intakes and fasts. Importantly, autophagy is also essential for maintaining cellular health by removing misfolded large molecules and aged/dysfunctional cellular organelles, such as mitochondria and ER (1Yin X.M.

In other words, decreased autophagy will inevitably slow the removal of misfolded large molecules and aged/dysfunctional cellular organelles. Accumulation of these molecules and dysfunctional cellular organelles may not only contribute to the development of cancers (1Yin X.M. Ding W.X. Gao W. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1773-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but also contribute to the development of metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance. For example, the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria will most likely cause increased mitochondrion-derived oxidative stress, which is known to contribute to the development of insulin resistance (6Houstis N.

Calcium. 2008; 18: 638-643PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin resistance is primarily caused by the positive energy imbalance between the intake and expenditure of calories. The mechanisms of insulin resistance have been under intense investigation but remain unestablished. However, it is known that the induction of insulin resistance in mice by obesity or high fat diet (HFD) is prevented or reversed when production of the mitochondrion-derived reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is blocked (6Houstis N. Rosen E.D. Lander E.S. Nature. 2006; 440: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar, 7Pospisilik J.A. Knauf C. Joza N. Benit P. Orthofer M. Cani P.D. Ebersberger I. Nakashima T. Sarao R.

Induction of insulin resistance in cultured cells is also blocked when mtROS is scavenged (6Houstis N. Rosen E.D. Lander E.S. Nature. 2006; 440: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). It has been clearly shown that oxidative stress is a precursor of insulin resistance (9Matsuzawa-Nagata N. Takamura T. Ando H. Nakamura S. Kurita S. Misu H. Ota T. Yokoyama M. Honda M. Miyamoto K. Kaneko S. Metabolism. 2008; 57: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Therefore, mtROS plays a critical/necessary role in the development of insulin resistance. The level of mtROS production may be influenced by many factors, such as mitochondrial mass and integrity. Much attention has been paid to the production of mitochondria via biogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that mitochondrial mass may be decreased in the subjects with insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia due to reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. It is well known that decreased mitochondrial number is a cardinal feature of insulin resistance (20Petersen K.F. Dufour S. Befroy D. Garcia R. Shulman G.I. N. Engl. J.

The ratio between mitochondrion-rich (type I) muscle fibers and glycolytic (type II) muscle fibers is decreased in subjects with insulin resistance (23Lillioja S. Young A.A. Culter C.L. Ivy J.L.

Suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis by antiretroviral nucleoside analogues is associated with the development of insulin resistance in patients with AIDS (26van der Valk M. Casula M.

We have recently shown that mitochondrial production is decreased by prolonged exposure to insulin, which resembles insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (10Liu H.Y. Yehuda-Shnaidman E. Hong T.

However, little attention has been paid to the removal of aged/dysfunctional mitochondria in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, probably due to the current perception that insulin is not functional in the presence of insulin resistance. Obviously, the removal of aged/dysfunctional mitochondria can affect both the mass and integrity of mitochondria and, hence, influence the production of mtROS. There is no doubt that the removal of mitochondria and other cellular organelles, such as ER, is autophagy-dependent (1Yin X.M. Ding W.X. Gao W. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1773-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, we have examined the level of hepatic autophagy in the presence of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia and the associated mechanism. Antibodies against LC3 and p62 were from MBL International (Woburn, MA). The monoclonal antibody against β-actin, the antibody against ubiquitin, the recombinant human insulin, and glucagon were from Sigma. Antibodies against total and phospho-Akt (serine 473/308) or phospho-FoxO1 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against IRS1(Tyr(P)416) was from Abcam (catalog number ab66153). Antibodies against PARP1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number SC-7150). LY294002 was from Calbiochem. Blood glucose concentrations were measured using a Breese® 2 glucose meter (Bayer HealthCare). Plasma insulin levels were measured with a Linco insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Protein assay kits were from Bio-Rad. The plasmid LC3-GFP and the recombinant adenoviruses encoding a constitutively nuclear FoxO1 mutant (ADA-FoxO1) were kind gifts from Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and Dr. Domenico Accili (Columbia University, New York, NY), respectively. Other materials were all obtained commercially and are of analytical quality. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences and fully complied with the guidelines from the National Institutes for Health. Animals were housed under the usual day (12-h daylight) and night (12-h darkness) circadian and fed ad libitum. The following animal experiments were included: 1) C57BL/6 (B6) mice were fed with either the HFD (Research Diets catalog number D12330: 58.0 kcal % fat, 16.0 kcal % protein, and 26 kcal % carbohydrate) or the normal rodent chow diet (ND) for 8 weeks (28Liu H.Y.

During the last week of the ND or HFD, some mice were administered the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection, once a day at 9 a.m., 7 days) during day time, when mice normally sleep and do not eat. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated from B6 mice that were fed with the ND and cultured in Williams' medium E supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (10Liu H.Y.

Mouse hepatoma 1c1c7 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by measuring levels of blood glucose and plasma insulin and calculated as previously described (36Lee S. Muniyappa R. Yan X. Chen H. Yue L.Q. Hong E.G. Kim J.K.

DNA plasmids were introduced into the indicated cells by Lipofectamine 2000 transfection agents (Invitrogen). Adenoviruses encoding the nuclear form of FoxO1 (ADA-FoxO1) or empty adenovirus, amplified in HEK-293 cells, were applied to infect primary hepatocytes at 108 plaque-forming units/well in 6-well plates as described (35Liu H.Y.

Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates (10–15 μg/ lane) were resolved in 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Target proteins were detected by immunoblotting with primary antibodies as indicated and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antisera. Fluorescent bands were visualized with a Typhoon 9410 variable mode Imager from GE Healthcare and then quantified by densitometry analysis using ImageQuant version 5.2 software from GE Healthcare. Total RNAs were extracted from cells or tissues with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNAs, which were quantified by TaqMan® real-time PCR with specific primers listed in Table 1 and normalized to levels of 36B4 transcripts.TABLE 1Full names and sequences of primers for real-time PCR used in this studyGene nameDNA sequencebeclin1Forward5′-ggccaataagatgggtctga-3′Reverse5′-cactgcctccagtgtcttca-3′vps34Forward5′-tgtcagatgaggaggctgtg-3′Reverse5′-ccaggcacgacgtaacttct-3′ulk2Forward5′-cagccctggatgagatgttt-3′Reverse5′-ggatgggtgacagaaccaag-3′atg12Forward5′-ggcctcggaacagttgttta-3′Reverse5′-cagcaccgaaatgtctctga-3′gabarapl1 (GEC1)Forward5′-catcgtggagaaggctccta-3′Reverse5′-atacagctggcccatggtag-3′36B4Forward5′-gcagacaacgtgggctccaagcagat-3′Reverse5′-ggtcctccttggtgaacacgaagccc-3′ Open table in a new tab Hepatoma 1c1c7 cells were plated onto glass bottom cell culture chamber (MatTek, Ashland, MA).

Some cells were then cultured in regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were next pretreated with 1 nm insulin for 30 min, followed by incubation in the nutrient starvation medium (Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS)) (Invitrogen) (37Tallóczy Z. Jiang W.

To test whether insulin suppresses the formation of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in the presence of insulin resistance, some cells were pretreated with insulin (10 nm) for 24 h to induce insulin resistance as described (27Liu H.Y. Cao S.Y. Hong T. Han J. Liu Z. Cao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (9 16): 27090-27100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were labeled with the mitochondrion-specific dye (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester, 25 nm) (catalog number T668, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were subsequently imaged live at room temperature in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol (Invitrogen) using a Zeiss LSM 510Meta confocal imaging system with a 30-milliwatt argon laser and a ×63 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective at ×2 zoom. GFP was detected using a 488-nm argon laser and detected with a 515–540-nm band pass filter. Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester fluorescence was excited with a 563-nm helium-neon laser attenuated and detected at >570 nm. The images were manipulated with Zeiss LSM software. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were compared by Student's t test with GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (San Diego, CA). Differences at values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. It is known that autophagy is normally suppressed by insulin (1Yin X.M. Ding W.X. Gao W. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1773-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether autophagy is increased or decreased in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The current general perception is that insulin is not properly functional in the presence of insulin resistance due to the fact that the response to acute insulin challenge is blunted in the presence of insulin resistance. Thus, some have speculated that autophagy may be increased in the presence of insulin resistance (38Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To address this issue, mice were fed with the HFD for 8 weeks, followed by measuring markers of autophagy. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, fasting plasma glucose levels were not yet altered by the 8-week HFD, whereas plasma insulin levels were significantly increased. As a result, insulin sensitivity evaluated by HOMA and QUICKI was significantly decreased, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. The basal level of Akt phosphorylation in the liver after a 12-h fast was increased by the HFD (Fig. 1C). To examine the level of autophagy in the liver, three autophagy markers were measured. First, the ratio of LC3-II over LC3-I is normally increased when autophagy is activated, and vice versa (1Yin X.M. Ding W.X. Gao W. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1773-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, the hepatic ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I was decreased by the HFD, suggesting that hepatic autophagy was suppressed by the HFD. Second, the level of p62, another autophagy marker (long lived protein), is normally increased when autophagy is suppressed (39Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H.

Our results clearly show that the hepatic level of p62 protein was indeed increased by the HFD (Fig. 1E), also suggesting that hepatic autophagy was decreased by the HFD. Third, levels of polyubiquitin are normally elevated when autophagy is suppressed (40Ebato C. Uchida T. Arakawa M. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Komiya K. Azuma K. Hirose T. Tanaka K. Kominami E. Kawamori R. Fujitani Y. Watada H. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 325-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1F showed that levels of polyubiquitin in the liver were increased by the HFD. These results from multiple aspects all show that the autophagy activity in the liver was decreased in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia induced by the HFD. The autophagy machinery includes two main ubiquitin-like complexes (1Yin X.M. Ding W.X. Gao W. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1773-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). In complex I (Fig. 2), Atg12 is activated by Atg7 and then transferred by Atg10 to Atg5. The Atg12-Atg5 dimer will be joined by Atg16 to form an Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 multimer complex, which is localized to membranes of early autophagosomes and will be subsequently joined by the complex II. The formation of autophagy complex II is initiated when LC3-I (a mammalian homologue of Atg8) is cleaved by Atg4 to produce LC3-II. LC3-II will then be conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine by Atg7 and Atg3. The unconjugated LC3-I stays in the cytosol, but the conjugated LC3-II binds to the autophagosomal membrane, following the formation of the complex I. Complex I will eventually detach from mature autophagosomes, whereas LC3-II stays on the membrane until it is degraded by the lysosomes. That is why LC3-II has been widely used as a marker for monitoring activation of autophagy. Additionally, several other proteins are required for the initiation of autophagy. These proteins include at least Ulks (a mammalian homologue of Atg6), Beclin1 (another homologue of Atg6), and Vps34 (a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). To further examine the autophagy process in the presence of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, mRNA levels of some of the above described autophagy genes were examined in the livers of the mice detailed in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 3, the mRNA levels of vps34, atg12, and gabarapl1 (protein name GEC, another homologue of Atg8 (41Zhao J. Brault J.J. Schild A. Cao P. Sandri M. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 472-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar)) genes were significantly decreased by the HFD, although Beclin1 and Ulk2 gene transcripts were not affected. Because vps34, atg12, and gabarapl1 genes are involved in the initiation and formation of complexes I and II of autophagy, respectively, these results further demonstrate that hepatic autophagy level is decreased in the presence of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia induced by the HFD. To explore whether or not insulin signaling was responsible for the suppressed autophagy in the presence of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance in mice was induced by the HFD (4 weeks) as we previously described (28Liu H.Y. Hong T. Wen G.B. Han J. Zhuo D. Liu Z. Cao W. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2009; 297: E898-E906Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some mice were administered the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 during day time (once a day for the last week), when mice normally sleep and do not eat. The basal level of insulin signaling was evaluated by measurements of Akt phosphorylation. Autophagy markers were detected as detailed above. Results showed that the basal level of Akt phosphorylation was increased by the HFD as we previously described (28Liu H.Y. Hong T. Wen G.B. Han J. Zhuo D. Liu Z. Cao W. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2009; 297: E898-E906Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) but reversed by the treatment with LY294002 (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). The autophagy marker p62 in the liver was increased by the HFD, and the increase was largely prevented by LY294002 (supplemental Fig. 1C). Transcript levels of key autophagy genes (vps34, atg12, and gebarapl1) in the liver were decreased by the HFD but reversed by the treatment with LY294002 (supplemental Fig. 1, D–F). These results imply that insulin is responsible for the suppressed autophagy in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. It has previously been shown that the autophagy level is increased in STZ-induced insulin deficiency, which resembles but is not an equivalent of T1DM (42Lenk S.E. Bhat D. Blakeney W. Dunn Jr., W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E856-E862PubMed Google Scholar). However, the associated mechanism has not been studied. Because the basal Akt-dependent insulin signaling is increased in the presence of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, as shown in Fig. 1 and supplemental"

Here we explore the possibility of curing colour blindness using gene therapy in experiments on adult monkeys that had been colour blind since birth. A third type of cone pigment was added to dichromatic retinas, providing the receptoral basis for trichromatic colour vision. This opened a new avenue to explore the requirements for establishing the neural circuits for a new dimension of colour sensation. Classic visual deprivation experiments have led to the expectation that neural connections established during development would not appropriately process an input that was not present from birth. Therefore, it was believed that the treatment of congenital vision disorders would be ineffective unless administered to the very young. However, here we show that the addition of a third opsin in adult red-green colour-deficient primates was sufficient to produce trichromatic colour vision behaviour. Thus, trichromacy can arise from a single addition of a third cone class and it does not require an early developmental process. This provides a positive outlook for the potential of gene therapy to cure adult vision disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2132200081,"Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) assemblies are thought to play primary roles in Alzheimer disease (AD). They are considered to acquire surface tertiary structures, not present in physiologic monomers, that are responsible for exerting toxicity, probably through abnormal interactions with their target(s). Therefore, Abeta assemblies having distinct surface tertiary structures should cause neurotoxicity through distinct mechanisms. Aiming to clarify the molecular basis of neuronal loss, which is a central phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, we report here the selective immunoisolation of neurotoxic 10-15-nm spherical Abeta assemblies termed native amylospheroids (native ASPDs) from AD and dementia with Lewy bodies brains, using ASPD tertiary structure-dependent antibodies. In AD patients, the amount of native ASPDs was correlated with the pathologic severity of disease. Native ASPDs are anti-pan oligomer A11 antibody-negative, high mass (>100 kDa) assemblies that induce degeneration particularly of mature neurons, including those of human origin, in vitro. Importantly, their immunospecificity strongly suggests that native ASPDs have a distinct surface tertiary structure from other reported assemblies such as dimers, Abeta-derived diffusible ligands, and A11-positive assemblies. Only ASPD tertiary structure-dependent antibodies could block ASPD-induced neurodegeneration. ASPDs bind presynaptic target(s) on mature neurons and have a mode of toxicity different from those of other assemblies, which have been reported to exert their toxicity through binding postsynaptic targets and probably perturbing glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Thus, our findings indicate that native ASPDs with a distinct toxic surface induce neuronal loss through a different mechanism from other Abeta assemblies."

https://openalex.org/W2082991065,"Chemokine receptors constitute an attractive family of drug targets in the frame of inflammatory diseases. However, targeting specific chemokine receptors may be complicated by their ability to form dimers or higher order oligomers. Using a combination of luminescence complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of hetero-oligomeric complexes composed of at least three chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR4). We show in T cells and monocytes that negative binding cooperativity takes place between the binding pockets of these receptors, demonstrating their functional interaction in leukocytes. We also show that specific antagonists of one receptor (TAK-779 or AMD3100) lead to functional cross-inhibition of the others. Finally, using the air pouch model in mice, we show that the CCR2 and CCR5 antagonist TAK-779 inhibits cell recruitment promoted by the CXCR4 agonist SDF-1 alpha, demonstrating that cross-inhibition by antagonists also occurs in vivo. Thus, antagonists of the therapeutically important chemokine receptors regulate the functional properties of other receptors to which they do not bind directly with important implications for the use of these agents in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1982562003,"A feature of the development of the cerebral cortex in the embryo is the migration of neocortical excitatory neurons along radial glial fibres. Less studied than this movement along columnar structures is the regulation and outcome of the tangential mixing of clonal populations of neural progenitors migrating from their origin and encountering those travelling from other proliferative units. Rakic and colleagues report evidence that EphA/ephrin-A signalling modulates this mixing of populations during circuit development. In the absence of ephrin-A, tangential migration is disrupted, leading to impaired lateral dispersion and abnormal columnar organization. Aberrant columnar organization is thought to cause functional impairment within circuits. During development of the cerebral cortex, excitatory projection neurons migrate to form a cellular infrastructure of radial columns. However, some of these clonally related neurons undergo a lateral shift to intermix with neurons originating from neighbouring proliferative units. This process is now shown to be dependent on Eph receptor A and ephrin A signalling, a so far unrecognized mechanism for lateral neuronal dispersion that seems to be essential for the proper intermixing of neuronal types in the cortical columns. The cerebral cortex is a laminated sheet of neurons composed of the arrays of intersecting radial columns1,2,3. During development, excitatory projection neurons originating from the proliferative units at the ventricular surface of the embryonic cerebral vesicles migrate along elongated radial glial fibres4 to form a cellular infrastructure of radial (vertical) ontogenetic columns in the overlaying cortical plate5. However, a subpopulation of these clonally related neurons also undergoes a short lateral shift and transfers from their parental to the neighbouring radial glial fibres6, and intermixes with neurons originating from neighbouring proliferative units5,7. This columnar organization acts as the primary information processing unit in the cortex1,8,9. The molecular mechanisms, role and significance of this lateral dispersion for cortical development are not understood. Here we show that an Eph receptor A (EphA) and ephrin A (Efna) signalling-dependent shift in the allocation of clonally related neurons is essential for the proper assembly of cortical columns. In contrast to the relatively uniform labelling of the developing cortical plate by various molecular markers and retrograde tracers in wild-type mice, we found alternating labelling of columnar compartments in Efna knockout mice that are caused by impaired lateral dispersion of migrating neurons rather than by altered cell production or death. Furthermore, in utero electroporation showed that lateral dispersion depends on the expression levels of EphAs and ephrin-As during neuronal migration. This so far unrecognized mechanism for lateral neuronal dispersion seems to be essential for the proper intermixing of neuronal types in the cortical columns, which, when disrupted, might contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders associated with abnormal columnar organization8,10."

TGF-β signaling is initiated by binding of ligands to two types of transmembrane receptors, both of which possess Ser/Thr kinase activity in their intracellular domains. Ligand binding induces the heterocomplex formation between the type I (ALK5/TβRI) and the type II (TβRII) receptors and thus the TβRII-mediated activation of ALK5.

Human BAMBI, initially named nma, is down-regulated in metastatic melanoma cell lines (33Degen W.G. Weterman M.A. van Groningen J.J. Cornelissen I.M. Lemmers J.P. Agterbos M.A. Geurts van Kessel A.

In this study, we demonstrated that hBAMBI, like its Xenopus homolog, inhibits TGF-β- and BMP-mediated transcriptional responses, TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of R-Smads, and cell growth arrest. In addition to its interference with receptor complex formation, we found that hBAMBI can synergize with Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β signaling by forming a ternary complex with ALK5 and Smad7 and inhibiting the interaction between ALK5 and R-Smads. These findings together suggest that the function of BAMBI is evolutionally conserved as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling.DISCUSSIONThe TGF-β family members play pivotal roles in embryo development and tissue homeostasis. Although the canonical Smad-mediated signaling pathway is relatively simple, it is precisely controlled at different levels from the availability and activation of extracellular ligands, the activity and stability of membrane receptors, to the activity, location, and stability of Smad proteins in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (14Hill C.S.

BAMBI was also found to counteract the effect of TGF-β on cell growth and invasion of human gastric carcinoma cell lines (35Sasaki T. Sasahira T. Shimura H. Ikeda S. Kuniyasu H. Oncol.

The expression of BAMBI is significantly up-regulated in most colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, and this up-regulation is mediated by β-catenin (31Sekiya T. Adachi S. Kohu K. Yamada T.

Furthermore, overexpression of BAMBI attenuated TGF-β signaling in these tumor cells, suggesting that β-catenin can promote the formation of colorectal and hepatocellular tumors by interfering with TGF-β-mediated growth arrest via BAMBI.

Toll-like receptor 4 and lipopolysaccharide sensitize hepatic stellate cells to TGF-β signaling by down-regulating the expression of BAMBI via a MyD88-NF-κB-dependent pathway. These studies suggest that the appropriate negative regulation of TGF-β by BAMBI is important for tissue homeostasis.

TGF-β signaling is initiated by binding of ligands to two types of transmembrane receptors, both of which possess Ser/Thr kinase activity in their intracellular domains. Ligand binding induces the heterocomplex formation between the type I (ALK5/TβRI) and the type II (TβRII) receptors and thus the TβRII-mediated activation of ALK5. Then the activated ALK5 recruits and phosphorylates the downstream signal mediators Smad2 or Smad3 proteins, which subsequently associates with Smad4, accumulates in the nucleus, and modulates target gene expression (8Feng X.H.

TGF-β signaling is tightly regulated temporally and spatially through multiple mechanisms at different levels: from the extracellular environment, the plasma membrane, and the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The regulation can take place in either positive or negative manners. Deregulation of TGF-β signaling might be linked to pathogenesis of various clinical disorders such as tumors, vascular diseases, and tissue fibrosis (4Miyazono K. Suzuki H. Imamura T.

BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor), a 260-amino acid transmembrane glycoprotein that is evolutionally conserved in vertebrates from fish to humans, is closely related to the type I receptors of the TGF-β family in the extracellular domain but has a shorter intracellular domain that exhibits no enzymatic activity (22Grotewold L.

It has been documented that Xenopus BAMBI functions as a general antagonist of TGF-β family members by acting as a pseudoreceptor to block the interaction between signaling type I and type II receptors (24Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massagué J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). BAMBI is tightly co-expressed with BMP4 during the embryo development of zebrafish, Xenopus, bird, or mouse, and its expression is also induced by BMP4 (22Grotewold L. Plum M. Dildrop R. Peters T. Rüther U. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massagué J. Niehrs C.

Therefore, BAMBI is believed to act as a negative feedback regulator of BMP signaling during embryo development (24Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massagué J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 25Tsang M. Kim R. de Caestecker M.P. Kudoh T. Roberts A.B. Dawid I.B.

Bush J.O. Ovitt C.E. Lan Y. Jiang R. Genesis. 2007; 45: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). BAMBI expression is also induced by TGF-β (29Xi Q. He W. Zhang X.H. Le H.V. Massagué J. J.

Our recent work showed that human BAMBI (hBAMBI) can promote Wnt signaling by enhancing the interaction of the Wnt receptor Frizzled5 and the downstream mediator Dishevelled2 (32Lin Z. Gao C. Ning Y. He X. Wu W. Chen Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), implicating that BAMBI might integrate different cellular signaling pathways. Several studies have suggested that BAMBI is involved in pathogenesis of human diseases. Human BAMBI, initially named nma, is down-regulated in metastatic melanoma cell lines (33Degen W.G. Weterman M.A. van Groningen J.J. Cornelissen I.M. Lemmers J.P. Agterbos M.A. Geurts van Kessel A. Swart G.W. Bloemers H.P. Int. J.

Cancer. 2009; 125: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Its elevated expression was suggested to attenuate the TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas (31Sekiya T. Adachi S. Kohu K. Yamada T. Higuchi O. Furukawa Y.

Shimura H. Ikeda S. Kuniyasu H. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 11: 1219-1223PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has also suggested that BAMBI is involved in Toll-like receptor 4- and lipopolysaccharide-mediated hepatic fibrosis (36Seki E. De Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Although BAMBI acts as a critical regulator of TGF-β/BMP signaling, how the regulation takes place is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that hBAMBI, like its Xenopus homolog, inhibits TGF-β- and BMP-mediated transcriptional responses, TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of R-Smads, and cell growth arrest. In addition to its interference with receptor complex formation, we found that hBAMBI can synergize with Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β signaling by forming a ternary complex with ALK5 and Smad7 and inhibiting the interaction between ALK5 and R-Smads. These findings together suggest that the function of BAMBI is evolutionally conserved as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. DISCUSSIONThe TGF-β family members play pivotal roles in embryo development and tissue homeostasis. Although the canonical Smad-mediated signaling pathway is relatively simple, it is precisely controlled at different levels from the availability and activation of extracellular ligands, the activity and stability of membrane receptors, to the activity, location, and stability of Smad proteins in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (14Hill C.S.

Med. 2007; 13: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptor 4 and lipopolysaccharide sensitize hepatic stellate cells to TGF-β signaling by down-regulating the expression of BAMBI via a MyD88-NF-κB-dependent pathway. These studies suggest that the appropriate negative regulation of TGF-β by BAMBI is important for tissue homeostasis. The TGF-β family members play pivotal roles in embryo development and tissue homeostasis. Although the canonical Smad-mediated signaling pathway is relatively simple, it is precisely controlled at different levels from the availability and activation of extracellular ligands, the activity and stability of membrane receptors, to the activity, location, and stability of Smad proteins in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (14Hill C.S.

Here, we demonstrated that hBAMBI, like its Xenopus homolog, functions as a general antagonist to attenuate the transcriptional activity of TGF-β/BMPs and inhibit TGF-β-induced R-Smad phosphorylation and cell growth arrest, indicating that the inhibitory activity of BAMBI on TGF-β signaling is evolutionally conserved. Although the possible function of BAMBI in TGF-β signaling has been examined in different animal models such as Xenopus (24Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massagué J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), zebrafish (25Tsang M. Kim R. de Caestecker M.P. Kudoh T. Roberts A.B. Dawid I.B.

Dev. 2001; 100: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying its function is still limited. It has been shown that Xenopus BAMBI can bind to TGF-β receptors and interfere with the heterocomplex formation between the type I and type II receptors (24Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massagué J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Here, we confirmed this mechanism with hBAMBI. Moreover, this study has discovered an additional mechanism whereby BAMBI cooperates with Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β signaling. Smad7 is a well characterized antagonist of TGF-β signaling. It was found to directly interact with the active type I receptors in competition with R-Smads and thus inhibit the activation of R-Smads (19Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L.

In this study, we found that hBAMBI also interacts with inhibitory Smads Smad6 and Smad7, and the interaction between hBAMBI and Smad7 was enhanced by TGF-β treatment. TGF-β promoted the association of hBAMBI with Smad7, and hBAMBI exhibited a higher binding affinity to active ALK5. Our study further demonstrated that hBAMBI, Smad7, and ALK5 form a ternary complex. Interestingly, unlike Smad7 and Smurfs, hBAMBI does not affect ALK5 turnover nor further promote Smad7/Smurf1-induced degradation of ALK5. Rather hBMABI inhibits the interaction between Smad3 and ALK5 and interferes with Smad3 phosphorylation. Therefore, our data suggest that BAMBI could exploit dual mechanisms to interfere with TGF-β signaling, and these two mechanisms may work cooperatively. Because BAMBI can also interact with Smad6, and both of them are negative regulators of BMP signaling, it is possible that BAMBI and Smad6 might cooperatively inhibit BMP signaling in similar manners. Indeed, overexpression of BAMBI inhibited the binding of Smad1(3A) with the constitutive active BMP type I receptor ca-ALK6, suggesting that BAMBI utilizes similar mechanisms to function as a general antagonist of the TGF-β family members. Despite a recent study reporting that BAMBI is dispensable for mouse embryo development and postnatal survival (28Chen J. Bush J.O. Ovitt C.E. Lan Y. Jiang R. Genesis. 2007; 45: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), other studies have underlined the possible important roles of hBAMBI in several pathological processes such as tumorigenesis and fibrogenesis. BAMBI was firstly reported to be a gene whose expression was reversely correlated with metastasis progression of human melanomas (33Degen W.G. Weterman M.A. van Groningen J.J. Cornelissen I.M.

BAMBI was also found to counteract the effect of TGF-β on cell growth and invasion of human gastric carcinoma cell lines (35Sasaki T. Sasahira T. Shimura H. Ikeda S. Kuniyasu H. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 11: 1219-1223PubMed Google Scholar) and bladder cancer cells (34Khin S.S. Kitazawa R. Win N. Aye T.T. Mori K. Kondo T. Kitazawa S. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 125: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The expression of BAMBI is significantly up-regulated in most colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, and this up-regulation is mediated by β-catenin (31Sekiya T. Adachi S. Kohu K. Yamada T.

https://openalex.org/W2127108097,"The human protein ASC is a key mediator in apoptosis and inflammation. Through its two death domains (pyrin and CARD) ASC interacts with cell death executioners, acts as an essential adapter for inflammasome integrity, and oligomerizes into functional supramolecular assemblies. However, these functions are not understood at the structural-dynamic level. This study reports the solution structure and interdomain dynamics of full-length ASC. The pyrin and CARD domains are structurally independent six-helix bundle motifs connected by a 23-residue linker. The CARD structure reveals two distinctive characteristics; helix 1 is not fragmented as in all other known CARDs, and its electrostatic surface shows a uniform distribution of positive and negative charges, whereas these are commonly separated into two areas in other death domains. The linker adopts residual structure resulting in a back-to-back orientation of the domains, which avoids steric interference of each domain with the binding site of the other. NMR relaxation experiments show that the linker is flexible despite the residual structure. This flexibility could help expand the relative volume occupied by each domain, thus increasing the capture radius for effectors. Based on the ASC structure, a tentative model is proposed to illustrate how ASC oligomerizes via CARD and pyrin homophilic interactions. Moreover, ASC oligomers have been analyzed by atomic force microscopy, showing a predominant species of disk-like particles of ∼12-nm diameter and ∼1-nm height. Taken together, these results provide structural insight into the behavior of ASC as an adapter molecule. The human protein ASC is a key mediator in apoptosis and inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2124272755,"The majority of CDF/ZnT zinc transporters form homo-oligomers. However, ZnT5, ZnT6, and their orthologues form hetero-oligomers in the early secretory pathway where they load zinc onto zinc-requiring enzymes and maintain secretory pathway functions. The details of this hetero-oligomerization remain to be elucidated, and much more is known about homo-oligomerization that occurs in other CDF/ZnT family proteins. Here, we addressed this issue using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, mutagenesis, and chimera studies of hZnT5 and hZnT6 in chicken DT40 cells deficient in ZnT5, ZnT6, and ZnT7 proteins. We found that hZnT5 and hZnT6 combine to form heterodimers but do not form complexes larger than heterodimers. Mutagenesis of hZnT6 indicated that the sites present in transmembrane domains II and V in which many CDF/ZnT proteins have conserved hydrophilic amino acid residues are not involved in zinc binding of hZnT6, although they are required for zinc transport in other CDF/ZnT family homo-oligomers. We also found that the long N-terminal half of hZnT5 is not necessary for its functional interaction with hZnT6, whereas the cytosolic C-terminal tail of hZnT5 is important in determining hZnT6 as a partner molecule for heterodimer formation. In DT40 cells, cZnT5 variant lacking the N-terminal half was endogenously induced during periods of endoplasmic reticulum stress and so seemed to function to supply zinc to zinc-requiring enzymes under these conditions.

The YiiP protomer has three tetrahedral zinc-binding sites formed by the cytosolic C-terminal tail and one tetrahedral zinc-binding site formed by four conserved hydrophilic residues (Asp45, Asp49, His153, and Asp157) in transmembranes (TMs) II and V (12Lu M. Fu D. Science. 2007; 317: 1746-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Information obtained from a number of mutagenesis studies has shown that the zinc-binding site embedded in the TM domains (TMDs) is essential for zinc transport across the cellular membrane by the CDF/ZnT proteins, suggesting that this may be true for all of the CDF/ZnT homo-oligomers (reviewed in Ref. 23Montanini B. Blaudez D. Jeandroz S. Sanders D. Chalot M. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In contrast, the characteristics of the hetero-oligomerization between ZnT5 and ZnT6 and their functional orthologues are poorly understood (19Fang Y. Sugiura R. Ma Y. Yada-Matsushima T. Umeno H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Ishihara K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol.

First, hZnT5 and its orthologues have an unusually long N-terminal sequence fused to the C-terminal half of six TMDs termed cation efflux domains (19Fang Y. Sugiura R. Ma Y. Yada-Matsushima T. Umeno H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J.

Second, vertebrate orthologues of ZnT6 lack two of the four conserved hydrophilic residues in TMs II and V (28Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Moreover, the functional yeast orthologues Zrg17p (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Zrg17 (S. pombe) show little homology to those of vertebrates. These discrepancies make it difficult to understand the properties of these hetero-oligomers (19Fang Y. Sugiura R. Ma Y. Yada-Matsushima T. Umeno H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Ishihara K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol.

We have previously reported that DT40 cells are a useful system in which to examine oligomer formation between hZnT5, hZnT6, and hZnT7 using a combination of gene disruption/re-expression and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (24Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Ishihara K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30956-30962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this system for the mutagenesis and chimera studies of hZnT5 and hZnT6. We found that hZnT5 and hZnT6 form heterodimers to transport zinc into the early secretory pathway. We also found that the positions of the conserved His or Asp residues within TMs II and V of the CDF/ZnT proteins do not form part of the zinc-binding site in hZnT6. This suggests that hZnT6 is unlikely to function as part of the zinc-binding sites embedded in the TMDs of the hZnT5/hZnT6 heterodimers. The unique long N-terminal half of hZnT5 appears to be dispensable for the formation of hZnT5/hZnT6 heterodimers, but the cytosolic C-terminal tail is important as a dominant factor in determining the binding of hZnT6 to form a heterodimer. Consistent with this finding is the fact that the chicken-specific cZnT5 variant lacking the N-terminal half was endogenously induced during periods of endoplasmic reticulum stress and seemed to function to supply zinc-requiring enzymes with zinc. These results aid the understanding of the unique properties of CDF/ZnT proteins that lead to the formation of heterodimers. Chicken B lymphocyte-derived DT40 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biowest), 1% chicken serum (Invitrogen), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) at 39.5 °C. DNA transfection into DT40 cells was carried out as previously described (16Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol.

Plasmids used for the expression of FLAG-tagged human ZnT5 (FLAG-hZnT5), HA-tagged human ZnT6 (HA-hZnT6), and FLAG- or HA-tagged human ZnT7 (hZnT7-FLAG or hZnT7-HA) have been described previously (24Suzuki T.

Plasmids used for the expression of HA-hZnT5, Myc-hZnT6, and FLAG-hZnT6 were constructed by inserting each cDNA into pA-Puro, pA-Ecogpt, or pA-Zeocin vectors. The plasmid used to express ΔNhZnT5 was constructed by deleting the N-terminal half of hZnT5 (amino acids 1–387) in which the start Met corresponds to Met388 in the full-length hZnT5. The plasmid used for the expression of the hZnT5N-hZnT7 chimera protein was constructed by fusing the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–398 of hZnT5 to the fragment encoding amino acids 18–376 of hZnT7 using a two-step PCR method as previously described (24Suzuki T.

For immunoprecipitation, the DT40 cell lysates were rotated with anti-FLAG M2 (1:200 dilution), anti-HA 3F10 (1:200 dilution), or anti-HA HA-11 (1:200 dilution) antibodies for 1 h prior to the addition of 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After incubating for 2 more hours, immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rat secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) or Trueblot anti-mouse IgG (eBioscience) were added at a 1:3000 dilution for detection. The fluoro-image was obtained using an LAS1000 plus (Fuji). Immunostaining for FLAG-ΔNhZnT5 or HA-hZnT6 was performed as previously described (24Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Ishihara K. Nagao M.

Briefly, the cells were stained with the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (1:50 dilution) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG and rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) as the secondary and tertiary antibodies and with anti-HA antibody (Sigma, 1: 50 dilution) followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG with Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) as the secondary antibody. The stained cells were observed using an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with an Olympus digital camera (Metamorph, Olympus). The images were analyzed using Adobe PhotoShop CS. To address the question of whether ZnT5 and ZnT6 form heterodimers or larger complexes, we established a series of ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− DT40 cell lines expressing various combinations of hZnT5 and/or hZnT6 all carrying different tags (or no tag) on the N terminus (Figs. 2 and 3). We then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. First, we confirmed that no functional interaction occurs between FLAG-hZnT6 and HA-hZnT6 (Fig. 2A) or FLAG-hZnT5 and HA-hZnT5 (Fig. 2B) when we co-expressed their trans-genes in ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells. However, a functional interaction was seen between FLAG-hZnT5 and HA-hZnT6 when both were co-expressed in the ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine which particular complexes were formed (heterodimers or larger complexes), we next examined whether FLAG-hZnT6 and HA-hZnT6 co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG or HA antibody when simultaneous expressed alongside hZnT5. Co-expression of hZnT5 in the ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells already expressing both FLAG-hZnT6 and HA-hZnT6 restored TNAP activity (a marker for zinc transport into the early secretory pathway) to the same level as that seen in wild-type DT40 cells. These results suggest the formation of ZnT5/ZnT6 hetero-oligomers in the cells (Fig. 3A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody did not show any functional interaction between FLAG-hZnT6 and HA-hZnT6 but did show an interaction between FLAG-hZnT6 and hZnT5 or HA-hZnT6 and hZnT5 (Fig. 3B, middle and right panels). These results indicate that hZnT5/hZnT6 hetero-oligomers containing one hZnT6 monomer were formed in the ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells co-expressing FLAG-hZnT6, HA-hZnT6, and hZnT5 (Fig. 3C). To examine the possibility that the hZnT5/hZnT6 hetero-oligomers include hZnT5 over two protomers, we repeated the experiment using FLAG-hZnT5, HA-hZnT5, and Myc-hZnT6. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies did not show any functional interaction between FLAG-hZnT5 and HA-hZnT5 even with the co-expression of Myc-hZnT6, suggesting that hZnT5/hZnT6 hetero-oligomers do not include hZnT5 over two protomers (Fig. 3, D, middle and right panels, and E). Taken together, these results show that ZnT5/ZnT6 hetero-oligomers are composed of one ZnT5 monomer and one ZnT6 monomer. Thus, ZnT5 and ZnT6 form a heterodimer that is then able to supply zinc into the early secretory pathway.FIGURE 3Human ZnT5 and hZnT6 form heterodimers.

Fu D. Science. 2007; 317: 1746-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23Montanini B. Blaudez D. Jeandroz S. Sanders D. Chalot M. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). From our sequence comparison (30Kambe T. Suzuki T. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2006; 4: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found that almost all vertebrate ZnT6 proteins substitute two of these hydrophilic residues with two hydrophobic residues (Leu66 and Phe201 in hZnT6) (Fig. 1), whereas these four hydrophilic residues are conserved in vertebrate ZnT5 proteins. This leads to the question of how the hZnT5/hZnT6 heterodimers form a zinc-binding site in the TMDs. To investigate this, we generated two sets of hZnT6 mutants: one in which the hydrophobic residues (Leu66 and Phe201) were replaced with His (HA-hZnT6L66H-F201H) and a second in which both hydrophilic Asp residues (Asp70 and Asp205) were replaced with Ala (HA-hZnT6D70A-D205A). We hypothesized that HA-hZnT6L66H-F201H would provide extra zinc-binding residues to the binding sites of the ZnT5/ZnT6 heterodimers, whereas HA-hZnT6 D70A-D205A would lack the zinc-binding residues at these sites. First, we expressed HA-hZnT6L66H-F201H and FLAG-hZnT5 or HA-hZnT6D70A-D205A and FLAG-hZnT5 in ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells and then examined whether heterodimer formation was impaired. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that, like the wild-type HA-hZnT6, both of the hZnT6 mutants form heterodimers with FLAG-hZnT5 (Fig. 4A). Next, we studied the zinc transport activity by measuring TNAP activity. Unexpectedly, TNAP activity in cell expressing both mutants was restored to a level comparable with that in ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells expressing both wild-type FLAG-hZnT5 and HA-hZnT6 (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the spatial arrangement of the zinc-binding residues is different in hZnT6 and that the sites present in TMs II and V in which many CDF/ZnT proteins have the conserved residues (Asp or His) required for the formation of zinc-binding sites are not involved in the zinc-binding site of hZnT6. Because the zinc-binding amino acid residues of hZnT5 (His451 and Asp599) are essential for its zinc transporting activity (31Ohana E. Hoch E. Keasar C. Kambe T. Yifrach O. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17677-17686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), hZnT5/hZnT6 heterodimers may form a zinc-binding site embedded in TMDs using only the four hydrophilic residues present in TMs II and V of the hZnT5 component. The C-terminal halves of the ZnT5 orthologues share homology between vertebrates and yeast, but the N-terminal halves of them are less similar (19Fang Y. Sugiura R. Ma Y. Yada-Matsushima T. Umeno H.

To investigate the importance of the N-terminal half of hZnT5 in heterodimer formation with hZnT6, we expressed a FLAG-tagged N-terminal deletion mutant of hZnT5 that still contained the C-terminal half of hZnT5 (FLAG-ΔNhZnT5). The FLAG-ΔNhZnT5 was co-localized with HA-hZnT6 to the vesicular compartments when expressed in ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells (Fig. 5A), indicating that the N-terminal half of hZnT5 is not required for its subcellular localization. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that FLAG-ΔNhZnT5 formed a heterodimer with HA-hZnT6 in the same manner as wild-type FLAG-hZnT5 (Fig. 5B). TNAP activity in the ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells expressing both the FLAG-ΔNhZnT5 mutant and HA-hZnT6 was also restored, although the activity was lower compared with that of ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells expressing both wild-type FLAG-hZnT5 and HA-hZnT6 (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the N-terminal half of hZnT5 is not required for heterodimerization with hZnT6 and the ability to supply zinc to TNAP. We found that ΔNcZnT5 mRNA was induced in DT40 cells during periods of endoplasmic reticulum stress along with small increases in full-length cZnT5 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S1) (17Ishihara K.

This was not seen in human and mouse cell lines (data not shown). The ΔNcZnT5 induced in DT40 cells probably functions to supply zinc into the early secretory pathway (supplemental Fig. S1). We also examined the possibility that the N-terminal half of hZnT5 may interfere with its homo-oligomerization by using a chimera protein of hZnT7 fused to the N-terminal half of hZnT5 (hZnT5N-hZnT7). TNAP activity in ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells expressing hZnT5N-hZnT7 was restored to the same extent as that in ZnT5−ZnT6−/−ZnT7−/− cells expressing hZnT7 alone (data not shown). This suggests that the N-terminal half of hZnT5 is not responsible for the inability of hZnT5 to form homo-oligomers. The C-terminal half of ZnT5 (ΔNZnT5) is highly homologous to ZnT7, particularly in the cation efflux domains (pfam01545; 48% sequence identity in humans) (Fig. 6A) (26Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol.

This suggests that ZnT5 may have specific domain(s) responsible for interaction with ZnT6. Reduced homology (∼20%) within the short cytosolic N terminus and the cytosolic C-terminal tail between ΔNZnT5 and ZnT7 suggests that both regions may have important functions in the interaction with ZnT6. To investigate this we made C terminus deletion mutants of Δ"
https://openalex.org/W2016015510,"The regulation of lipid homeostasis by insulin is mediated in part by the enhanced transcription of the gene encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). The nascent SREBP-1c is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and must be transported to the Golgi where two sequential cleavages generate its NH(2)-terminal fragment, nSREBP-1c. We have shown recently that in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, insulin rapidly and selectively stimulates proteolytic processing of the nascent SREBP-1c by enhancing the affinity of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP).SREBP-1c complex for coatomer protein complex II (COPII) vesicles. The SCAP.SREBP complex is retained in the ER by Insig proteins. We report here that insulin persistently stimulates controlled proteolysis of the nascent SREBP-1c by selectively reducing the level of Insig-2a protein via accelerated degradation of its cognate mRNA. Insulin enhanced the rate of turnover of Insig-2a mRNA via its 3'-untranslated region. Insulin-induced depletion of Insig-2a promotes association of the SCAP.SREBP-1c complex with COPII vesicles and subsequent migration to the Golgi where site-1 and site-2 proteases process the nascent SREBP-1c. Consistent with this mechanism, experimental knockdown of Insig-2a expression with small interfering RNA mimicked insulin-induced proteolysis of the nascent SREBP-1c, whereas exogenous expression of Insig-2a in hepatocytes led to reduced intramembrane proteolysis of the newly synthesized SREBP-1c. The action of insulin on the processing of the nascent SREBP-1c via Insig-2a was highly selective, as proteolysis of the newly synthesized SREBP-2 remained unchanged under identical conditions. On the basis of these data, we propose that the stimulation of SREBP-1c processing by insulin is mediated by a selective depletion of Insig-2a protein by promoting decay of its cognate mRNA. Thus, insulin-induced reduction in Insig-2a protein leads to an enhanced export of the SCAP.SREBP-1c complex from ER to the Golgi."

The IKKα/β and MAPK signaling pathways downstream of MyD88 and TRIF activate transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1, which are commonly associated with expression of inflammatory gene products (11.Lee M.S. Kim Y.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 447-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Activation of TBK1 and IKKϵ downstream of TRIF causes IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) activation, which is required for transcription of IFNβ and of type I interferon-inducible genes (12.Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Mühlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways have overlapping functions that can cause harmful inflammatory effects as well as potent enhancement of adaptive immunity. This makes TLR4 an important therapeutic target because it is the only TLR known to engage both signaling pathways. One of the signaling pathways activated by both TRIF and MyD88 involves the MAPK family of signaling kinases (11.Lee M.S. Kim Y.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 447-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that different MAPKs play different roles in mediating expression of MyD88-associated versus TRIF-associated genes at either transcriptional levels via activation of transcription factors or at post-transcriptional levels via mRNA transcript stabilization (13.Chiang E.

Immun. 2003; 71: 2498-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) noted previously that MPLA increased levels of not only TRIF-associated transcripts, such as IFIT1 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats) and IFIT2, but also significant levels of NF-κB-associated IL-10, TNFα, IL-12, and co-stimulatory molecules, despite comparatively weak NF-κB activation. These patterns suggest that specific members of the MAPK family may play a role in determining how MPLA-induced gene expression differs from that of LPS. Characterizing the biological activities of various structures related to that of LPS is the subject of current efforts to achieve less inflammatory yet potent immunostimulatory activity (1.Alderson M.R. McGowan P. Baldridge J.R. Probst P. J. Endotoxin Res. 2006; 12: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our earlier study (3.Mata-Haro V. Cekic C. Martin M. Chilton P.M. Casella C.R. Mitchell T.C. Science. 2007; 316: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) focused on a comparison of LPS and MPLA, which had both been derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota Re595 and consisted of mixtures of acylated diglucosamine structures that had varying numbers of acyl side chains, from three to seven. Use of these heterogeneous mixtures allowed us to study the closest available approximation to the clinical grade form of MPLA, MPLTM adjuvant but prevented a more detailed understanding of how differential engagement of TLR4 occurs. For example, structural acyl chain heterogeneity may cause activation of receptors or molecules other than TLR4, such as TLR2 or members of the inflammasome-activating nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family. Although it has been shown elsewhere that repurification of commercially available LPS structures prevents nonspecific TLR2 and inflammasome activation, even ultrapurified LPS or MPLA preparations (but not synthetic lipid A) have been reported to activate both TLR2 and TLR4 in the presence of the lipid A-binding molecule CD14 (22.Martin M. Michalek S.M. Katz J. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2498-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23.Spiller S. Dreher S. Meng G. Grabiec A. Thomas W. Hartung T. Pfeffer K. Hochrein H. Brade H. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13190-13198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the “active” form of MPLA has several structural differences compared with LPS. These differences include length of the oligosaccharide side chains, lack of two of three phosphate groups, as well as the differences in acyl chain number and length, which made correlation of outcomes with a single structural element impossible. To determine whether alteration of a single phosphate group can cause TRIF-biased signaling, we therefore performed extensive comparisons of the signaling activities of synthetic monophosphate lipid A (sMLA) and diphosphate lipid A (sDLA). Due to reagent availability, it was necessary to make this comparison in the context of an Escherichia coli-type lipid A structure, which differs from that of S. minnesota lipid A at one secondary acyl chain. We now report that homogeneous preparations of synthetic E. coli MPLA (sMLA) largely retained their TRIF bias as compared with E. coli sDLA, indicating that a change in a single phosphoryl group is sufficient to bring about TRIF-biased activation of TLR4. Examination of signaling activity downstream of TLR4 revealed that sMLA strongly activated p38 but not JNK MAPK activity, which was associated with optimal IP-10, TNFα, and IL-10 but weak MCP-1 and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) expression. Both MyD88 and TRIF were found to play non-redundant roles in p38 activation after sMLA stimulation, indicating that sMLA-induced signaling is not completely devoid of MyD88 involvement. Results of this study thus identify a novel biochemical mechanism for TLR4-dependent patterns of gene expression by monophosphorylated lipid A that can be exploited to improve the safety and efficacy of immunostimulatory agents. C57BL/6 mice and TRIFlps2/lps2 mutant mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. MyD88−/− mice were a gift from Shizuo Akira (via Ross Kedl, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). All mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free animal facility at the University of Louisville, and experiments were performed under supervision of its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Synthetic versions of monophosphoryl lipid A (sMLA) and diphosphoryl lipid A (sDLA) derived from the lipid A structures of E. coli LPS were purchased from Invivogen and Peptides International, respectively. Paired batches of sMLA and sDLA were prepared simultaneously by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with gentle vortexing until particles were no longer visible; stocks were then aliquoted in small, disposable volumes and stored at −80 °C. Thawed aliquots of sMLA or sDLA were used once and were never refrozen or reused. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor was purchased from R&D Systems. Single strand cDNA synthesis enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen. Enzyme Mix 2×, containing SYBR Green dye for quantitative real-time PCR, was purchased from Applied Biosystems. Inhibitors of p38 (SB202190) and JNK (SP600125) were obtained from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. All primary antibodies used for immunoblotting experiments in this study were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, except for antibodies against total JNK, TAK1, IRF3, and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and total ASK1 (apoptosis-regulating signal kinase 1) (Abcam, Inc.). Phospho-ASK1 (Thr-845) was described in Ref. 24.Matsuzawa A. Saegusa K. Noguchi T. Sadamitsu C. Nishitoh H. Nagai S. Koyasu S. Matsumoto K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) were prepared according to a protocol modified from that of Lutz et al. (25.Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rössner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). Briefly, femurs and tibiae were collected and flushed with sterile Hank's balanced salt solution twice. The resulting bone morrow cells were resuspended in R10F (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) plus 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and 5 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. 2 × 106 cells per bacteriological culture plate were cultured for 10 days, with feeding on days 3 and 8 by adding 10 ml fresh medium and on day 6 by replacing one-half of the culture medium. Non-adherent cells were collected on day 10 and verified to be between 85 and 95% CD11b+/CD11c+/MHCII+/CD80+/CD86low/Gr1−/CD4−/CD8−/B220−/CD19− by flow cytometry before use in experiments. Splenocytes (1 × 106) were preincubated for 2 h in 96-well flat bottom plates at 37 °C prior to stimulation with different concentrations of sMLA or sDLA. Supernatants were collected after overnight incubation at 37 °C and tested for IP-10 (R&D Systems) and IFNγ (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. TLR4 agonist-induced changes in steady-state mRNA levels, which reflect both transcriptional activity and transcript stability, were measured in quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. BM-DCs (1 × 106) were rested for 2 h in polystyrene tubes (12 × 75 mm) at 37 °C and then treated with 100 ng/ml sMLA or sDLA (diluted in R10F). In all experiments, DMSO was used as vehicle control. Cells were lysed 1, 2, or 3 h after activation in guanidine thiocyanate buffer. For p38 or JNK inhibition experiments, BM-DCs were preincubated for 30 min with 10 μm SB202190 (p38 inhibitor) or 10 μm SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) and then treated with the indicated concentrations of sMLA or sDLA for 1 h. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III Platinum Two-Step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast system and Power SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix. QuantiTect primers (Qiagen) were used for all qPCR assays except for primers used to measure β-actin mRNA (forward: TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC; reverse: TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG), which were purchased from Sigma-Genosys. Expression of each target gene was normalized to β-actin and fold expression over vehicle control was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCτ method (26.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar). BM-DCs (2–3 × 106) were rested for 2 h in polystyrene tubes at 37 °C and then exposed to sMLA or sDLA. In all experiments, DMSO was used as vehicle control. At the indicated time points, cells were centrifuged in ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution containing 50 μm NaF and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing Complete mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 250 nm okadaic acid (Sigma). Protein concentrations in the resulting lysates were measured using BCA assay (Pierce) and then mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer (1× final concentration). Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 8–10% SDS-PAGE gels for electrophoresis, after which resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) and blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk or with 5% bovine serum albumin for some immunoblots. Primary antibodies were dissolved in 5% bovine serum albumin except for β-actin and IRF3 total antibodies, which were dissolved in 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the blocked membranes overnight at 4 °C. After exposure to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat secondary antibodies for 1 h in nonfat dry milk, bands were visualized using the ECL Plus detection system (GE Healthcare), and band intensities were analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad version 4.6.6). Two factor (time or dose versus treatment) analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey's tests were performed to determine the significance of the differences between sDLA-induced versus sMLA-induced cellular effects on gene expression and signaling. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups. All qPCR data were normalized to β-actin, and phosphoprotein band intensities were normalized to total protein levels. In some cases, β-actin normalization was used for phospho-IRF3 due to failure of recognition by total antibody after stripping. Signals from DMSO alone-treated cells were used as reference points for calculation of fold increases in expression and intensities. Because biological preparations of LPS and MPLA are heterogeneous and have several structural differences from one another, we compared synthetic MPLA (sMLA) and synthetic diphosphoryl lipid A (sDLA) to test whether TRIF bias is attributable to a single phosphate difference between lipid A structures rather than acylation, heterogeneity, or other structural differences. Therefore, we stimulated splenocytes with different concentrations of sMLA versus sDLA and checked the secreted levels of IP-10 (TRIF-associated) and IFNγ (MyD88-associated) from culture supernatants after overnight incubation. As shown in Fig. 1A, sMLA and sDLA are equally potent at inducing IP-10 protein secretion, whereas sMLA-induced IFNγ secretion is weaker as compared with sDLA. To test if TRIF-biased signaling outcomes also occur in more homogenous cell populations, we next tested dendritic cells, which are relevant due to their primary role in antigen presentation and adjuvant activity. We performed time course and dose-response experiments using BM-DCs and measured transcript levels of TRIF-associated versus MyD88-associated genes with qPCR 1–3 h after exposure to agonist. sMLA appeared to be as efficient as sDLA at increasing transcript levels of TRIF-associated gene products (IP-10, IFIT1, and IFIT2) while only weakly affecting those of MyD88-associated inflammatory gene products (COX-2, serpine-1, and endothelin-1) (Fig. 1, B and C). TRIF-associated gene expression requires the activation of IRF3 through the TRIF/TRAF3 pathway, whereas both MyD88 and TRIF activate the NF-κB pathway to induce maximal inflammatory cytokine expression (6.Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T. Chow A. Akira S. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 9.Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P.

Biochem. 2007; 76: 447-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that TRIF-biased gene expression by sMLA will be associated with strong IRF3 activation through TRIF but with weak stimulation of the NF-κB pathway. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, sMLA induced slightly reduced but nevertheless strong IRF3 phosphoactivation, which was completely TRIF-dependent because no activity was detectable with either agonist in TRIF-deficient cells (Fig. 2A, right). Both IKK and its downstream target NF-κB (p65) were only weakly phosphoactivated after sMLA stimulation (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, a change in a single phosphate was sufficient to shift TLR4 activation from driving balanced MyD88 and TRIF contributions to a state that is biased to the TRIF pathway. In our earlier results defining biological monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as a TRIF-biased agonist of TLR4, not all TRIF-dependent genes (such as MCP-1) were induced to the same levels as observed with LPS. Furthermore, not all MyD88-associated genes were weakly activated after MPLA stimulation (3.Mata-Haro V. Cekic C. Martin M. Chilton P.M. Casella C.R. Mitchell T.C. Science. 2007; 316: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To better understand adaptor component requirements for TRIF and/or MyD88-associated gene expression, we exposed BM-DCs from wild-type (WT), or MyD88- (MyD88KO), or TRIF-deficient (Lps2) mice to either sMLA or sDLA and measured IP-10, MCP-1, or COX-2 transcript levels using qPCR. Importantly, for MyD88KO cells, in which TLR4 signaling is forced to occur through the TRIF adaptor pathway, sMLA and sDLA gave identical patterns indicating that the TRIF-stimulating activity of sMLA was fully functional as compared with sDLA (Fig. 3, A–C, right panels). The IP-10 pattern in WT versus mutant cells (Fig. 3A) indicates IP-10 expression was primarily a function of TRIF and that sMLA had full activity with respect to its induction (Fig. 3A). MCP-1 transcripts were also strictly dependent on TRIF, but comparison of the activity of sDLA (open symbols) in WT (Fig. 3B, left) versus MyD88KO (Fig. 3B, far right) cells indicated that MyD88 plays a role in maximizing and maintaining MCP-1 transcript levels in sDLA-stimulated cells. Notably, MCP-1 transcript levels were low in sMLA-stimulated WT cells, which is consistent with weak stimulation of MyD88. Finally, COX-2 transcript levels indicated an important role for MyD88 (Fig. 3C, right), as expected, but also an unanticipated contribution by TRIF (Fig. 3C, center). Overall, these results suggested that sMLA retains full potency with respect to TRIF-stimulating activity, whereas weak induction of MCP-1 and COX-2 was attributable to the weak stimulation of MyD88 by sMLA because these genes require MyD88 as well as TRIF for optimal expression. It has been shown that p38 and JNK MAPKs can modulate the activation of both MyD88- and TRIF-associated genes (11.Lee M.S. Kim Y.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 447-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 14.Navarro L. David M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 3218-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By using specific inhibitors of these enzymes (Fig. 4A), we next tested if sMLA differentially requires one MAPK pathway over another to induce potent IP-10 but weak MCP-1 and COX-2 expression. We preincubated BM-DCs with the inhibitors of either p38 or JNK pathway before activating with sDLA and tested specificity of their inhibitory activity by measuring phosphoactivation of c-Jun and MAPKAPK2 as direct downstream targets of JNK and p38, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, preincubation of BM-DCs with SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) diminished phosphoactivation of c-Jun but not MAPKAPK2, whereas SB202190 (p38 inhibitor) preincubation prevented only phosphoactivation of MAPKAPK2 but not c-Jun, confirming specific activity of these inhibitors for their corresponding targets. To test involvement of p38 and JNK MAPKs in IP-10, MCP-1, and COX-2 expression, we preincubated BM-DCs with the inhibitors of these kinases or with DMSO as control before exposing to either sMLA or sDLA and performing qPCR. We plotted the percent decrease in transcript levels after inhibitor + TLR4 agonist treatment group relative to DMSO + TLR4 agonist treatment as a measure of percent inhibition of sMLA- or sDLA-induced mRNA expression. (Fig. 4B shows a sample of this calculation.) Preincubation with the inhibitor of p38 but not JNK caused a significant inhibition of IP-10 expression after either sMLA or sDLA treatment as compared with DMSO preincubated control group (Fig. 4B, black bars). MCP-1 RNA expression, on the other hand, was strongly dependent on JNK activation because JNK but not p38 inhibition caused significant decreases in MCP-1 transcript levels (Fig. 4C, white bars), indicating that sMLA can be a strong inducer of the p38 but not the JNK pathway. This pattern might explain potent IP-10 but not MCP-1 mRNA expression. Finally, COX-2 mRNA expression was found to depend partially on p38 (50% inhibition of transcript levels by p38 inhibitor; Fig. 4D, white bars) and almost entirely on JNK activation (90% inhibition by JNK inhibitor; Fig. 4D, white bars), suggesting low COX-2 transcript levels after exposure to sMLA may result from weak activation of the JNK pathway. In our previous study, we found that MPLA and LPS had unexpectedly similar potencies in induction of proinflammatory TNFα and anti-inflammatory IL-10 (3.Mata-Haro V. Cekic C. Martin M. Chilton P.M. Casella C.R. Mitchell T.C. Science. 2007; 316: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated the p38 pathway as being required for optimal expression of both of these cytokines (27.Salmon R.A. Guo X. Teh H.S. Schrader J.W. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 920-928PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested if sMLA could induce equivalent mRNA expression of these cytokines as compared with sDLA and if p38 is required for this activity. As can be seen in Fig. 5, A and B, sMLA and sDLA also revealed similar potency with res"

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a key regulatory protein that prevents proliferation of damaged cells. This central player in maintaining tissue integrity is present at low levels under unperturbed conditions but becomes rapidly stabilized and activated in response to a variety of stimuli such as ionizing radiation, genome instability, DNA damage, transforming growth factor-β, DNA or RNA virus infection, Type I interferons, and overexpressed oncogenes (1.Lavin M.F. Gueven N. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). p53 responds to these diverse stresses to regulate many target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, senescence, or DNA repair or alter metabolism (2.Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of p53 contains many evolutionarily conserved serine, threonine, and lysine residues for which post-translational modifications have a crucial role in p53 stabilization and activation. Most residues that are phosphorylated are targeted by many different kinases in response to various stresses when p53 is activated, although some phosphorylations have been reported to be inhibitory (3.Toledo F.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). p53 transcriptionally activates the mdm2 gene, and because MDM2 inhibits p53 activity, this forms a negative feedback loop that tightly regulates p53 function (5.Iwakuma T. Lozano G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to inactivation of p53-stimulated apoptosis, the oncogenic properties of MDM2 may in part be mediated by an anti-apoptotic activity that converts E2F-1 from a negative to a positive regulator of cell cycle progression by maintaining E2F-1 in a permanent state of growth stimulation (6.Loughran O. La Thangue N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2186-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). murine double minute clone 2 casein kinase 1 4[4-(2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-5-pyridin-2-yl-1-H-imidazol-2-yl]benzamidine (±)-4-[4,5-Bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2-isopropoxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-4,5-dihydro-imidazole-1-carbonyl]-piperazin-2-one vaccinia-related kinase 1 small interfering RNA wild type Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium dimethyl sulfoxide phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorter. MDM2 has been dissected into multiple functional domains: an N-terminal allosteric hydrophobic pocket that interacts with specific linear peptide docking motifs in proteins such as p53, a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal, an acidic domain that binds the ubiquitin signal in the DNA-binding domain of p53, a C-terminal RING domain that coordinates E3 functions in ubiquitin transfer, an ATP-binding motif that regulates the chaperone functions of MDM2, and a pseudo-substrate motif or lid that regulates its ubiquitin ligase function (7.Worrall E.G. Wawrzynow B. Worrall L. Walkinshaw M. Ball K.L. Hupp T.R. J. Chem. Biol. 2009; 2: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2 has demonstrated a two-site docking model for modification of p53. This involves occupation of the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 by a priming ligand (p53) that induces a docking event between the acidic domain of MDM2 and a ubiquitin signal in the DNA-binding domain of p53 (8.Wallace M. Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although a similar dual-site docking ubiquitination mechanism by MDM2 operates on the interferon regulatory factor-2 transcription factor (9.Pettersson S. Kelleher M. Pion E. Wallace M. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the ubiquitination or chaperone functions of MDM2 dominate on E2F-1 in cells (10.Stevens C. Pettersson S. Wawrzynow B. Wallace M. Ball K. Zylicz A. Hupp T.R. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 4875-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Upon DNA damage, p53 is post-translationally modified to inhibit interactions with MDM2 and to stabilize protein-protein interactions with transcription factor machinery. Several kinases also phosphorylate MDM2 and modulate interactions with p53 in different conditions. Thus p53 and MDM2 integrate signals of multiple signaling pathways by post-translational modifications. The interaction of both proteins is regulated through their phosphorylation status. CK1 represents a unique group within the superfamily of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic organisms and is evolutionarily conserved. In mammals, seven distinct genes encoding CK1 isoforms (α, β, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ, and ϵ) and their various splice variants are expressed. CK1 activity is regulated by various mechanisms including subcellular compartmentation and, in the case of CK1δ and ϵ, proteolytic cleavage, autophosphorylation, and dephosphorylation of the C terminus. Among the increasing number of CK1 substrates are enzymes, transcription factors, splice factors, cytoskeleton proteins, receptors, membrane-associated proteins, and cell signaling proteins (11.Knippschild U. Gocht A. Wolff S. Huber N. Löhler J. Stöter M. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Several CK1 isoforms, α, δ, and ϵ, have been identified that phosphorylate the N-terminal phosphorylation sites of p53. Upon DNA damage or DNA virus infection, phosphorylation of p53 at the threonine 18 site by CK1δ (12.Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and the serine 20 site by CK1α (13.MacLaine N.J. Oster B. Bundgaard B. Fraser J.A. Buckner C. Lazo P.A. Meek D.W. Höllsberg P. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28563-28573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), respectively, is believed to attenuate the interaction of p53 with its inhibitory counterpart MDM2 and to stabilize the binding of the co-activator p300, thereby activating p53 function. The interplay between p53 and MDM2 on different levels is influenced not only by the phosphorylation status of p53 but also the phosphorylation status of MDM2. Interestingly, CK1δ as well as CK1ϵ have been shown, in normal conditions, to phosphorylate several serine residues within the acidic domain of MDM2, which are involved in the degradation of p53 and the binding to other proteins (14.Winter M. Milne D. Dias S. Kulikov R. Knippschild U. Blattner C. Meek D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16356-16364Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together, the involvement of CK1, especially CK1δ, in the regulation of p53 and MDM2 functions as well as their interplay suggests an important role of CK1 in modulating the effects of p53 on cell growth and genome integrity. Because of the phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2 by some CK1 isoforms in normal conditions or after DNA damage, and the link between E2F-1, MDM2, and p53 pathways, we set out to investigate the effects of CK1 depletion or inhibition on the expression of key proteins. Our data indicate that CK1, like MDM2, plays a fundamental role in regulating the steady-state levels of the p53 and E2F1 tumor suppressor proteins. The observation that a small molecule inhibitor of CK1 induces cell death also suggests CK1 might form an attractive target for anti-cancer therapeutics. All of the experiments were performed with the A375 cell line, which is an adherent human amelanotic malignant melanoma cell line, and/or with HCT116 wt and p53−/− cell lines, which are adherent human colon carcinoma cell lines. The cell stocks were maintained in DMEM or McCoy's 5A, respectively (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Autogen Bioclear). A375 cells were treated with x-ray irradiation at a dose of 5 grays using a cabinet x-ray system (Faxitron) and then returned to the incubator for 1–48 h. Untreated controls were included. D4476 (Calbiochem) was transfected using Attractene (Qiagen) into the cells as recommended by the supplier. The cells were treated with 5–40 μm of D4476 (final concentration) for 48 h. Mock transfected, DMSO solvent, and untreated controls were included. Nutlin-3 (Alexis® Biochemicals) was used directly by addition to the cell culture medium at 5 and 10 μm (final concentration) for 24 h. DMSO solvent and untreated controls were included. siRNA to specific target genes was obtained from Dharmacon. The genes targeted were CK1α (siGENOME SMARTpool against human CSNK1A1 (NM_001892)), CK1δ (siGENOME SMARTpool against human CSNK1D (NM_001893)), VRK1 (siGENOME SMARTpool against human VRK1 (NM_003384)), and p53 (siGENOME set of 4 siRNA duplexes against human TP53 (NM_000546)). siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA Pool#2 was used as a control. The cells were transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentration of siRNA used was 40 nm (or 80 nm when cells were transfected with two different siRNAs). The cells were incubated for 72 h. Lipofectamine (mock transfected) controls and untreated controls (DMEM only) were included. The cells were harvested and lysed in urea buffer (7 m urea, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm Na4P2O7, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins (20 or 40 μg of lysate) were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis using 10 or 15% polyacrylamide gels in SDS running buffer. The proteins were transferred to Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk (Marvel) or 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (Table 1). The membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were detected by incubation with ECL reagent. The membranes were blotted dry and exposed to x-ray film (SLS), which was then developed (x-ray imaging equipment; Fuji).TABLE 1Different primary antibodies used for Western Blotting and co-immunoprecipitationTarget proteinClonePrimary antibody typeSupplierβ-ActinAC-15Mouse monoclonalSigma (A5441)CK1αC-19Goat polyclonalSanta Cruz Biotechnology (SC-6477)E2F-1KH95Mouse monoclonalSanta Cruz Biotechnology (SC-251)MDM22A10Mouse monoclonalFrom Borek VojtesekbDepartment of Experimental Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.p21EA10Mouse monoclonalCalbiochem (OP64)pRBG3–245Mouse monoclonalBD Biosciences Pharmingen (554136)p53DO1Mouse monoclonalFrom Borek VojtesekbDepartment of Experimental Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.p53CM1aUsed only for immunoprecipitation step of p53.Rabbit polyclonalFrom Borek VojtesekbDepartment of Experimental Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.IRF120Mouse monoclonalBD Biosciences (612047)a Used only for immunoprecipitation step of p53.b Department of Experimental Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.

The lysates were precleared by incubation with Sepharose CL 4B (Sigma-Aldrich) and protein G-SepharoseTM 4 FastFlow (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 40 min. Two μg of primary antibody (Table 1) was incubated with 500 μg of protein in the precleared lysate in a final volume of 200 μl for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Two types of negative control were included: no antibody with precleared lysate and antibody with co-immunoprecipitation buffer only. Fifteen μl of protein G-Sepharose was then added to the above samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Supernatant (flow-through) was collected, and the beads were washed four times with 500 μl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. Fifty μl of 4× SDS sample buffer containing 0.2 m dithiothreitol was then added to the beads, the samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and the eluate was collected. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Treated cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS. The PBS cell suspensions were mixed gently with 5 ml of ice-cold ethanol 70% and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Fixed cells were rehydrated in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell cycle profiles were obtained (from more than 10,000 cells) using a BD FACSAria II SORP flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with BD FACSDiva 6 and FlowJo7 software. We had recently reported the co-purification of vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) and casein kinase 1 (CK1) in a screen for virus-induced p53 serine 20 kinases; CK1 was identified as a selective virus-induced kinase targeting p53 (13.MacLaine N.J. Oster B. Bundgaard B. Fraser J.A. Buckner C. Lazo P.A. Meek D.W. Höllsberg P. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28563-28573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether endogenous CK1α or VRK1 plays a role in regulating p53/MDM2 pathways in cycling cells, we transfected A375 cells with isoform-specific siRNA against CK1α (CSNK1A1 gene) or VRK1, which reduced the level of CK1α or VRK1, respectively, by 3-fold (Fig. 1). Interferon regulatory factor-1 levels were assessed to evaluate whether siRNA treatment triggered the up-regulation of this positive transcription factor for genes involved in immune response, cell growth regulation, and apoptosis in mammalian cells that can affect the p53 signaling pathway. The down-regulation of CK1α protein triggered p53, MDM2, and p21 increase, alongside a dephosphorylation of pRB (Fig. 1). These changes were not observed after treating cells with siRNA to VRK1 (Fig. 1). The previously documented ability of CK1 to induce MDM2 phosphorylation, which might control MDM2 ubiquitination activity (14.Winter M. Milne D. Dias S. Kulikov R. Knippschild U. Blattner C. Meek D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16356-16364Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggested that our results could be due to a disruption between MDM2 and p53 binding after CK1α depletion, leading to an increase of p53 and thus of the p53-inducible gene products MDM2 and p21. p21 is known for inhibiting cyclin·cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and thus can explain the dephosphorylated status of pRB when p21 increased. Furthermore, CK1α depletion after siRNA treatment led to a significant decrease of E2F-1 (Fig. 1), which might be explained by disruption of the stabilizing binding between E2F-1 and MDM2, which has been shown to displace other ubiquitin ligases from E2F-1 (15.Zhang Z. Wang H. Li M. Rayburn E.R. Agrawal S. Zhang R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7238-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether CK1α kinase activity was generating these protein level changes in p53 and E2F-1, we analyzed cell cycle targets using a specific kinase inhibitor. There are three main chemical inhibitors of CK1 that can be used, one of which, D4476, shows a more pronounced specificity for CK1 at low concentrations (16.Rena G. Bain J. Elliott M. Cohen P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Upon increasing the addition of D4476 to A375 cells, there was a dose-dependent reduction in E2F-1 protein levels (Fig. 2A), slightly more pronounced with 20 μm D4476. Interestingly, pRB simultaneously showed a decrease in its phosphorylation status (Fig. 2B). A dose-dependent increase in p53, MDM2, and p21 protein levels was also observed (Fig. 2A). These increases were especially pronounced with a concentration of 40 μm D4476 (Fig. 2A, lane 7 versus lane 1). Because the D4476 drug has been shown to efficiently inhibit at least the delta isoform of CK1, we decided to check whether or not the depletion of CK1 by siRNA treatment triggers the same effects as CK1α siRNA treatment. CK1δ depletion did not generate any increase of p53 or MDM2 protein levels (Fig. 3, lane 4 versus lane 3). Only p21 levels did increase significantly (Fig. 3). Thus we can hypothesize that the effects from D4476 treatment on A375 cells described above are CK1α-specific. Nevertheless it is possible that CK1δ siRNA treatment did not trigger what we expected because CK1δ expression is too low in this cell line. But in this latter case, it means that D4476 effects in the A375 cell line should be indeed mainly because of CK1α inhibition. We studied changes in protein levels after the physiological stress of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. As expected, levels of p53 rose after exposure to 5 Grays of x-ray as did levels of MDM2, which is probably p53-dependent because of the feedback loop between MDM2 and p53 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Transactivation of p53 led also to an increasing up-regulation of p21; E2F-1 levels decreased 24 h after treatment (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). As for CK1α, the protein levels were not affected by ionizing radiation over a time course experiment (data not shown). This result favors the interpretation that CK1α promoter does not present a p53-responsive element, unlike CK1δ (11.Knippschild U. Gocht A. Wolff S. Huber N. Löhler J. Stöter M. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether CK1α siRNA can cooperate with DNA damage to increase the p53, MDM2, and p21 protein levels and decrease the E2F-1 protein level (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8, and B). A375 cells were transfected with control siRNA or CK1α siRNA for 72 h, followed either by a treatment with 5-Gray x-ray or control exposure, and cultured for a further 24 h. Interferon regulatory factor-1 levels were also assessed for the same reason as explained above. The results showed that p53 and MDM2 protein levels were increased after x-ray in the siRNA controls. These protein levels were also increased after CK1α siRNA treatment without x-ray treatment (slightly more than above) but were not further increased after x-ray treatment. By contrast, the decrease of E2F-1 protein level was two times more pronounced after x-ray than without in cells transfected with CK1α-specific siRNA. These data suggest that inhibition of CK1α expression followed by x-ray treatment shows a synergistic effect on E2F-1 levels. To determine whether E2F-1 decrease and MDM2 increase following CK1α siRNA treatment are dependent on the presence of p53, we first transfected A375 cells with both isoform-specific siRNA against CK1α and isoform-specific siRNA against p53. CK1α siRNA treatment triggered the same protein level changes as described above. p53 siRNA treatment alone triggered a decrease of p21 protein level but no change in E2F-1 and MDM2 protein levels (Fig. 5, A). Both siRNAs together reduced the level of CK1α and p53 by 3-fold compared with controls (Fig. 5, A). The results show that the p21 and MDM2 increases after CK1α siRNA treatment were abolished when p53 was also attenuated. This implies that the MDM2 and p21 increases after CK1α siRNA treatment seem to be entirely dependent on p53 transactivation. The E2F-1 decrease after CK1α siRNA treatment was partially abrogated when p53 was also depleted by siRNA, however p53 was only partially depleted by this treatment. To establish p53 dependence more clearly, we compared protein levels from HCT116 wt and HCT116 p53−/− cells, following D4476 treatment (Fig. 5, B and C). In HCT116 wt cells (Fig. 5B), the p53, MDM2, p21, and E2F-1 protein levels were affected in the same manner as in A375 cells after D4476 treatment (Fig. 2A), which indicated that these effects are not cell type-dependent. In HCT116 p53−/− cells after D4476 treatment, E2F-1 protein levels still decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). All of these data suggest that the stabilization of E2F-1 observed when CK1α is present is p53-independent. This stabilization effect could operate by at least two different mechanisms: a direct effect of CK1α on E2F-1 and/or an indirect effect of CK1α mediated through MDM2. MDM2 has been shown to interact with the CK1δ isoform, which phosphorylates the latter on serine residues 240, 242, and 246 in the acidic domain (14.Winter M. Milne D. Dias S. Kulikov R. Knippschild U. Blattner C. Meek D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16356-16364Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, transfected MDM2 has been shown not to bind to CK1α by immunoprecipitation (17.Chen L. Li C. Pan Y. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6509-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After DNA damage, p53 has also been shown to bind CK1δ and CK1ϵ isoforms (18.Knippschild U. Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. DeMaggio A.J. Christenson E. Hoekstra M.F. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and to be phosphorylated at some sites by CK1α (13.MacLaine N.J. Oster B. Bundgaard B. Fraser J.A. Buckner C. Lazo P.A. Meek D.W. Höllsberg P. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28563-28573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by CK1δ (12.Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction spectrum of endogenous CK1α with our different key proteins p53, MDM2, and E2F-1, we tested whether endogenous CK1α co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous MDM2, p53, and E2F-1. Surprisingly, the three endogenous proteins showed significant binding to endogenous CK1α (Fig. 6, A and B, lower panels, lane 6, and C, lane 8). Although CK1α seemed to bind nonspecifically to the beads to some extent (Fig. 6, C, lower panel, lane 4, and A, lower panel, lane 2, respectively), with E2F-1 or MDM2 antibody bound to the beads, the co-immunoprecipitated CK1α band was more pronounced. Thus there appears to be stable complexes between CK1α and p53, between CK1α and MDM2, and also between CK1α and E2F-1 in unstressed A375 cells. We set out to determine whether these modifications following inhibition of CK1α expression or activity are similar to the effects induced by other known p53 activating molecules to identify the mechanism of action of CK1α. The first target we considered was MDM2 because of its previously documented link with CK1. Treatment of A375 cells (Fig. 7A) or HCT116 wt cells (Fig. 7B, lanes 1–4) with Nutlin-3 affected the MDM2, p53, p21, and E2F-1 protein levels and phosphorylation status of pRB in the same manner as CK1 inhibitor or siRNA treatment. Nutlin-3 molecule binds in the p53-binding pocket of MDM2 and displaces p53 from the complex. This results in p53 stabilization and p21 and MDM2 induction. Nutlin-3 affected the E2F-1 protein levels to the same extent as CK1α siRNA treatment. It has been shown recently that Nutlin inhibits the binding between MDM2 and E2F-1, which promotes the increased ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation of E2F-1 by other ubiquitin ligases (19.Ambrosini G. Sambol E.B. Carvajal D. Vassilev L.T. Singer S. Schwartz G.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3473-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus we can conclude that CK1α, through MDM2 phosphorylation activity or interaction, in normal conditions, may promote the binding of MDM2 with p53 and E2F-1. In the context of HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 7B, lanes 5–8), Nutlin-3 treatment did not affect the E2F-1 protein level in the same way that D4476 treatment did in the absence of p53 (Fig. 5C). This result highlights an interesting difference between the two drugs. After CK1α siRNA or D4476 treatment, A375 cells were observed to be proliferating slower, if at all, compared with controls, as if the treatment induced cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we stained the DNA of D4476-treated A375 cells with propidium iodide and analyzed the cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry (Fig. 8A). Cell cycle distribution profiles indicated that, upon increasing the addition of the drug to A375 cells, the incidence of a sub-G1 fraction (less than normal diploid DNA content) increased, implying a possible apoptotic effect of the CK1 inhibitor D4476 on cells. Interestingly, cell cycle distribution profiles upon Nutlin-3 treatment exhibited, to a smaller extent, an increase of the sub-G1 fraction (Fig. 8B). Moreover, Nutlin-3 was shown to display pro-apoptotic activity in mantle cell lymphoma (20.Tabe Y. Sebasigari D. Jin L. Rudelius M. Davies-Hill T. Miyake K. Miida T. Pittaluga S. Raffeld M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), highlighting another common point between D4476 and Nutlin-3 treatment. Taking into account the increase of a sub-G1 cell population following CK1 inhibition, we tested whether this protection against apoptotic events was p53-dependent or -independent in the same manner as previously, using HCT116 wt and p53−/− cells. As with A375 profiles (Fig. 8), upon increasing the addition of D4476, HCT116 wt cell cycle distribution profiles showed the appearance of a sub-G1 fraction (Fig. 9A). Interestingly, this apoptotic cell population was still"

Using purified proteins, we show that desmosomal cadherins and α-catenin compete directly for binding to plakoglobin, consistent with the absence of α-catenin in desmosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2066080177,"Lactobacillus reuteri mucus-binding protein (MUB) is a cell-surface protein that is involved in bacterial interaction with mucus and colonization of the digestive tract. The 353-kDa mature protein is representative of a broadly important class of adhesins that have remained relatively poorly characterized due to their large size and highly modular nature. MUB contains two different types of repeats (Mub1 and Mub2) present in six and eight copies, respectively, and shown to be responsible for the adherence to intestinal mucus. Here we report the 1.8-Å resolution crystal structure of a type 2 Mub repeat (184 amino acids) comprising two structurally related domains resembling the functional repeat found in a family of immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding proteins. The N-terminal domain bears striking structural similarity to the repeat unit of Protein L (PpL) from Peptostreptococcus magnus, suggesting binding in a non-immune Fab-dependent manner. A distorted PpL-like fold is also seen in the C-terminal domain. As with PpL, Mub repeats were able to interact in vitro with a large repertoire of mammalian Igs, including secretory IgA. This hitherto undetected activity is consistent with the current model that antibody responses against commensal flora are of broad specificity and low affinity.

Compared with the present understanding of the adhesive mechanisms of human pathogenic bacteria, knowledge on the surface molecules mediating lactobacillus adhesion to the intestinal mucosa (i.e. epithelial cells, mucus layer, and/or extracellular matrices) and their corresponding receptors is less advanced. The mucus adhesins from lactobacilli that have been identified and functionally characterized to date are the surface-associated mucus-binding protein (MUB) of Lactobacillus reuteri 1063 (23.Roos S. Jonsson H. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the lectin-like mannose-specific adhesin of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 (26.Pretzer G. Snel J. Molenaar D. Wiersma A. Bron P.A. Lambert J. de Vos W.M. van der Meer R. Smits M.A. Kleerebezem M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6128-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and the Mub of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (25.Buck B.L. Altermann E. Svingerud T. Klaenhammer T.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 8344-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These three mucus-binding proteins have a similar domain organization typical of cell-surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. At the N terminus is found a signal peptide targeting the protein for transport through the plasma membrane. An anchoring motif (LPXTG) that is recognized by a family of enzymes called sortases for covalent attachment of the transported protein to the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall (31.Desvaux M. Dumas E. Chafsey I. Hébraud M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 256: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) is found at the C terminus. Interposed between these is the third and final domain containing a number of tandemly arranged mucus-binding repeats (Mub). MUB from L. reuteri 1063 is predicted to have a 49-amino acid N-terminal secretion signal peptide, followed by a mature protein with a predicted molecular mass of 353 kDa. It is a highly repetitive protein containing two types of related amino acid repeats (Mub1 and Mub2) (Fig. 1, A and B), which have been shown to be responsible for the adherence to intestinal mucus. Six copies (RI through RVI) of a type 1 repeat (Mub1) are observed, ranging from 183 to 206 amino acids in length, and eight copies (R1 through R8) of a type 2 repeat (Mub2), all 184 amino acids long except for R1 with 186 amino acids, based on the Mub domain borders as described in a previous study (32.Boekhorst J. Helmer Q. Kleerebezem M. Siezen R.J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which differ slightly from the repeat sizes originally reported (23.Roos S. Jonsson H. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These are organized in an interesting manner, with the Mub2 repeats inserted in between the Mub1 repeats RIV and RV (Fig. 1A). The six Mub1 repeats are rather diverse, whereas the Mub2 repeats show relatively low sequence variation (Fig. 1B). Mub repeat-containing proteins are most abundant in lactic acid bacteria (LAB), with the highest abundance in lactobacilli of the GIT, strongly suggesting that the Mub repeat is a functional unit specific to LAB that could fulfill an important function in host-microbe interactions. In this study, we report the first three-dimensional structure of a mucus binding repeat providing the first insights into a previously undetected Ig-binding activity for the repeat structural unit of MUB proteins. L. reuteri 1063 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (strain ATCC 53608). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of DNA molecules encoding individual or multiple Mub repeats of the L. reuteri 1063 MUB protein were designed to anneal to specific Mub domain border regions, as defined in previous studies (32.Boekhorst J. Helmer Q. Kleerebezem M. Siezen R.J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33.Bumbaca D. Littlejohn J.E. Nayakanti H. Lucas A.H. Rigden D.J. Galperin M.Y. Jedrzejas M.J. Proteins. 2007; 66: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Wild-type recombinant proteins were expressed from pETBlue-1 AccepTor (Novagen) in Escherichia coli Tuner™ (DE3/pLacI, Novagen). The L48M mutant of Mub-R5 was generated using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the gene-specific oligonucleotides listed in supplemental Table S2 and vector pETBlue-1:Mub-R5 as template. Wild-type Mub-R5 and mutant L48M proteins were labeled using the SelenoMet™ system (Athena Enzyme Systems™) and expressed in T&GE. coli B834 (DE3/pLacI) (Novagen). Recombinant Mub domains were purified from freeze-thaw or BugBuster® HT (Novagen)-soluble cell extracts by ion-exchange fast-protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). See also the supplemental materials. Edman N-terminal protein sequencing was carried out by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility (University of Cambridge, UK). ESI-MS of purified proteins was performed using a micrOTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Ltd.). Data were acquired in positive ionization mode at a capillary voltage of 4200 V and over a scan range of 250–3000 m/z. Trypsinized samples of proteins excised from SDS-PAGE gels were analyzed in an Ultraflex MALDI-ToF/ToF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Ltd.) or by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in an LTQ-Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher), and MS data were searched against the relevant sequence databases using Mascot 2.1 and 2.2 search engines (Matrix Science Ltd.), respectively. CD spectroscopy was performed in a JASCO J-710 spectropolarimeter (Great Dunmow, Cambs, UK). A scan speed of 50 nm/min was used over a scan range of 260–185 nm with a bandwidth of 1.0 nm, a response time of 2.0 s, and a data pitch of 0.5 nm. The data were analyzed with JASCO Spectra Manager 32 v1.40.00a software, and CONTINLL (34.van Stokkum I.H. Spoelder H.J. Bloemendal M. van Grondelle R. Groen F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) from the CDPro suite of programs was used to calculate the spectra and the proportion of each type of secondary structure (using IBasis reference set 3). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge, equipped with absorbance optics, at 20 °C and speeds of 9,000, 15,000, and 20,000 rpm. Mub-R5 (20.0 μm), Mub-R6 (20.0 μm), Mub-RI (23.6 μm), and Mub-RI–III (8.0 μm) were prepared in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) each in a total volume of 110 μl prior to centrifugation, and samples were analyzed against PBS buffer blanks. Scans were recorded every 4 h to determine when proteins had reached equilibrium in the centrifuge, after which time five scans were recorded for each sample. The freeware program UltraScan II (Borries Demeler, University of Texas) was used to fit the obtained sedimentation equilibrium profiles to single molecular species. Complete details of all methods are given in the supplemental materials. Recombinant Mubs were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate at pH 9.3 using an adapted standard protocol (see supplemental materials). Target proteins, including human secretory-IgA, IgG, and IgM (Sigma), human IgG-Fab/κ and IgG-Fc fragments (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX), and bovine serum albumin Fraction V (Sigma) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) were vacuum-blotted onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (3.8 × 11.6 cm, 0.45 μm, Millipore) using a Hoefer PR600 24-slot apparatus. 1–20 μg of target protein was loaded per slot in a total volume of 100 μl. Blots were blocked for 18 h with gentle rocking at room temperature in 10 ml of Thermoblock protein-free blocking agent in PBS buffer (Thermo Scientific). All subsequent washing steps were carried out with 20 ml of PBS buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Blocked membranes were incubated at room temperature with 10 ml of fluorescein-conjugated Mub proteins (200 μg/ml f-Mub, fluorescein/protein (F/P) ratio: 0.99–2.37) or fluorescein-conjugated protein L (18 μg/ml f-PpL; F/P ratio 0.63) in PBS buffer (±1 mm CaCl2) with gentle rocking in the dark for 20 h. Following excitation at 488 nm, fluorescein signals were detected at 530 nm in a Pharos FX™ Plus Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One® v4.6.1 software (Bio-Rad). Background-subtracted signals were normalized to a probe F/P ratio of 1.0 and a probe concentration of 1 μm. Purified native Mub-R5 was concentrated to 2 mg/ml prior to crystallization. Single crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at 4 °C using a precipitant solution containing 0.2 m ammonium formate and 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals were cryoprotected by increasing the concentration of polyethylene glycol 3350 in the drops to 30% (v/v) and a native diffraction dataset was subsequently collected to 1.8-Å resolution at 100 K. These crystals were of space group P212121 and contained two copies of the protein in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 48% (v/v). Crystals of the SeMet-(L48M) mutant of Mub-R5 grew under similar conditions to those found for the native protein and were cryoprotected in an identical fashion. These crystals were found to be essentially isomorphous with those of the native protein, and the structure was solved by selenium SAD using heavy atom sites located by SOLVE (35.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Initial phase estimates were improved with RESOLVE (36.Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and used to calculate an electron density map at 2.0-Å resolution. A preliminary molecular model was built comprising >80% of the polypeptide using ARP/wARP (37.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). This was completed by manual building using COOT (38.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) alternating with simulated annealing with PHENIX (39.Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J.

The structure of the native protein was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the SeMet mutant protein as search model. Refinement at 1.8-Å resolution resulted in a final structural model lacking only the C-terminal alanine residue in both independent molecular copies of Mub-R5 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.

The recombinant single Mub repeats Mub-RI, Mub-R5, and Mub-R6 and the triple Mub repeat Mub-RI–III were expressed in soluble form in T&GE. coli and purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). The electrophoretic mobility of the proteins gave molecular weight estimates higher than that predicted from the amino acid sequences, similar to that observed with recombinant MucB2 domain from Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein SP1492 (33.Bumbaca D. Littlejohn J.E. Nayakanti H. Lucas A.H. Rigden D.J. Galperin M.Y. Jedrzejas M.J. Proteins. 2007; 66: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, ESI-MS and MALDI-ToF-MS confirmed the integrity of the proteins, giving masses within 1 mass unit of the predicted sizes (supplemental Table S3). The pIs of all four proteins, as determined by isoelectric focusing, were 4.39 (Mub-R5), 4.33 (Mub-R6), 4.64 (Mub-RI), and 5.20 (Mub-RI–III), in agreement with the theoretical values. The N-terminal sequence of the triple domain Mub-RI–III, as determined by Edman sequencing, was MQEAAISFYD, in agreement with the amino acid sequence. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the four Mub proteins demonstrated that they were monomers under the conditions tested (data not shown). After the production of SeMet-labeled proteins, ESI-MS analysis revealed that SeMet incorporation was essentially complete (92–98%) at the two or three methionine residues present in the recombinant 185-amino acid wild-type Mub-R5 and L48M proteins, respectively (supplemental Table S3). CD spectra of unlabeled and SeMet-Mub-R5/L48M proteins were similar, consisting predominantly of β-structure (∼63%) with <0.5% α-structure (supplemental Fig. S2). Recombinant native Mub-R5 and the SeMet derivative of the (L48M)Mub-R5 mutant were crystallized, and a structure for the polypeptide component of the asymmetric unit of the L48M mutant was determined by selenium SAD phasing and refined at 2.0-Å resolution. The crystallographic R-factor of this interim model was 28.2% (R-free 33.3%). The structure of the native protein was then solved by molecular replacement using the mutant protein structure as a search model and refined to give an overall crystallographic R-factor of 20.2% (R-free 25.9%) at 1.8-Å resolution (Table 1). Incorporation of an additional methionine into the mutant led to only local and minor structural differences with the native protein (data not shown). The two copies of native Mub-R5 found in the crystallographic asymmetric unit consist of 184 residues (including the additional N-terminal methionine) and are similar, with an r.m.s.d. calculated for the Cα atoms to be 1.1 Å. All subsequent discussion refers to the refined native protein repeat structure, and the residue numbering system used is such that residue numbers 2–184 in the structure of the repeat correspond to 2063–2245 in the full-length MUB (supplemental Table S1). The overall structure of Mub-R5 resembles a distorted cylinder ∼110 Å long and 25 Å in diameter at its widest point. It is made up of two discrete domains: an N-terminal domain composed of the first 75 residues and a C-terminal domain comprising residues 76–184 (Fig. 1C). The domain limits are essentially equivalent to those suggested in a previous study (32.Boekhorst J. Helmer Q. Kleerebezem M. Siezen R.J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal domain coincides with the MucBP domain definition from the Pfam data base (PF06458) (45.Finn R.D. Tate J. Mistry J. Coggill P.C. Sammut S.J. Hotz H.R. Ceric G. Forslund K. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D281-D288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). We will subsequently refer to the N- and C-terminal domains of Mub-R5 as the B1 and B2 domains, respectively. The B1 domain possesses an ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold most similar to that found in the Ig-binding superfamily (46.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). This fold consists of two pairs of antiparallel β-strands forming a four-stranded mixed β-sheet connected by an α-helix. The strand order of the β-sheet is 2143. Interpretation of the residual electron density maps for the refined structure revealed a peak at 8.0 σ above the mean. The octahedral coordination of this site together with the coordination distances (supplemental Table S4) allowed us to identify this feature as originating from a bound calcium ion (47.Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This was subsequently confirmed by refinement. The residues involved in binding this ion are located at the N terminus of strand β1 (the side chain of Gln-2) and in the loop connecting β3 and β4 (the side chain of Asp60 and the main-chain carbonyl groups of Asp62 and Asn65). Two water molecules complete the coordination sphere of the metal (supplemental Fig. S3). This bound ion serves to stabilize the conformation of the polypeptide loop preceding strand β4 in the N-domain. The B1 and B2 domains possess a degree of structural similarity. Superposition using DALI (41.Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) gives an r.m.s.d. of 2.5 Å for 66 aligned residues of which 14% are identical (Z-score 4.5) (Fig. 1, D and E). However, despite its structural similarity to the B1 domain, the B2 domain does not possess a canonical β-grasp fold, because it lacks the connect"

Isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography reported herein indicate that multivalency effects underlie efficient dynein assembly and regulation. For a ternary complex of a 60-amino acid segment of dynein intermediate chain (IC) bound to two homodimeric dynein light chains Tctex1 and LC8, there is a 50-fold affinity enhancement for the second light chain binding. For a designed IC construct containing two LC8 sites, observed the 1000-fold enhancement reflects a remarkably pure entropic chelate effect of a magnitude commensurate with theoretical predictions. The lower enhancement in wild-type IC is attributed to unfavorable free energy changes associated with incremental interactions of IC with Tctex1. Our results show assembled dynein IC as an elongated, flexible polybivalent duplex, and suggest that polybivalency is an important general mechanism for constructing stable yet reversible and functionally versatile complexes.

Its C-terminal domain (C-IC) provides the sites for assembly of heavy chains, whereas its N-terminal domain (N-IC) provides binding sites for diverse light chains, for the p150Glued subunit of dynactin (4.King S.J.

In vitro studies of various segments of N-IC indicate that it is natively disordered and monomeric (11.Makokha M. Hare M. Li M. Hays T. Barbar E.

Nyarko A. Barbar E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to form a β-strand incorporated into a β-sheet at the light chain dimer interface (see Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) (14.Benison G.

Tctex1 and LC8 are homologs (see supplemental Fig. S1) that bind at adjacent highly conserved IC recognition sequences (see supplemental Table S1). In addition to binding IC, both associate with a wide variety of proteins once presumed to be dynein cargo linked by Tctex1 or LC8 to the dynein motor. However, recent structural data (14.Benison G. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15.Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) binds either two chains of IC or two chains of putative cargo proteins at the same location (14.Benison G. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16.Wang L. Hare M. Hays T.S. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4611-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), making the adaptor hypothesis much less attractive. An alternative hypothesis is that LC8 is a hub protein essential for promoting the dimerization and physiological activity of its diverse protein partners, including IC (17.Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Such a regulatory role for these light chains in dynein assembly has been suggested based on the evidence that LC8 binding induces IC/IC self-association (13.Benison G. Nyarko A. Barbar E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and that the binding affinity of LC8 to IC is enhanced when Tctex1 is present (15.Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In vivo studies (18.King S.J. Brown C.L. Maier K.C. Quintyne N.J. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5089-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) of various truncations of N-IC show that an IC lacking the light chains recognition sequence binds less efficiently to p150Glued and is less effective at inhibiting dynein-based transport than a longer IC containing the light chains recognition sequence and the second predicted coiled-coil. In such experiments, overexpressed IC is presumed to bind free dynactin and competes with endogenous dynein IC resulting in perturbed microtubule organization and centrosome integrity. A similar experiment using deletions of N-IC shows the intact C-IC is not sufficient for efficient binding to the heavy chain, but requires both light chain binding sites and the second coiled-coil (9.Ma S. Triviños-Lagos L. Gräf R. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1261-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The importance of both light chains for dynein function is clear; unknown are the mechanisms by which the two light chains work together to enhance the binding of IC to p150Glued on one end and to the dynein heavy chain on the other. To determine the potential role of Tctex1 and LC8 in IC assembly and regulation, we measure here the thermodynamics of formation of the IC·Tctex1·LC8 system, along with the model system IC·LC8·LC8. Mutual enhancement is expected as prior binding of IC to either light chain produces a bivalent IC duplex. The thermodynamics of these complexes and the structural organization of IC promote the formation of an IC duplex that serves as a polybivalent scaffold for dynein assembly and illustrate a novel aspect of the LC8-driven dimerization of a new class of intrinsically disordered proteins. A synthetic peptide corresponding to IC residues 123–138 was purified as described earlier (19.Hall J. Hall A. Pursifull N. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11940-11952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). D. melanogaster ICTL, Tctex1 and LC8 were prepared as described earlier (11.Makokha M. Hare M. Li M. Hays T. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13.Benison G. Nyarko A. Barbar E. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ICLL gene was produced by GeneScript (Piscataway, NJ). Purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: ICLL molecular mass = 7893.1 Da (7897.5 theoretical). Sequence-based calculation of absorptivity at 280 nm was used to measure protein concentrations (22.Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 531-552PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were dialyzed in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium azide, pH 7.5. Thermodynamics of binding were determined at 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Data were processed using the manufacturer's supplied software package, Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA), and fit to a single-site binding model, A + B → AB, where A refers to a single IC chain and B refers to a single protomer of Tctex1 or LC8. Heat of dilution, estimated to be equal to the enthalpy of the final injection, was subtracted from the binding data prior to fitting. Experiments were conducted with IC in the sample cell, and Tctex1 or LC8 in the syringe. For all experiments the “c value” (c = [protein]sample cell × Kd−1) was within the 5 to 500 range required for reliable determination of association constants (23.Turnbull W.B. Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14859-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were conducted with ICTL saturated with a 5-fold excess of either LC8 or Tctex1. Cell and syringe concentrations of 0.07 and 0.8 or 0.025 and 0.4 mm were used for apo- or pre-bound ICTL, respectively. Cell and syringe concentrations of 0.07 and 1.35 mm were used for ICLL. Average values are reported with error estimation as the difference between a minimum of two repeats for each temperature. Changes in heat capacity at constant pressure (ΔCpexp) were determined from the change in enthalpy (ΔH0) as a function of temperature. All ΔCpexp values were obtained with linear correlation coefficients of >0.98. Calculated changes in heat capacity (ΔCpcalc) were computed as described by Spolar and Record (24.Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Changes in solvent accessible surface area were determined using SURFACE RACER 5.0 (25.Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Protein data bank structures 2P2T (14.Benison G. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), 3FM7 (Tctex1 site only), 3FM7 (LC8 site only), and 3GLW were used to model apo-ICTL·LC8, pre-bound ICTL·Tctex1, pre-bound ICTL·LC8, and ICLL·LC8 complexes, respectively. Association states were determined from analytical size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75) with an online multiangle light scattering detector (miniDawn, Wyatt Technology) in 200 mm sodium sulfate, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. Data were processed using ASTRA version 5.1.9.1 (Wyatt Technology). The molecular mass of apo-ICTL and the ICTL/Tctex1/LC8 complex were 7.7 and 68.7 kDa, respectively, in good agreement with the theoretical molecular masses for a monomer (7.8 kDa) and a dimer of heterotrimers (67.3 kDa), respectively. An IC construct (corresponding to residues 92 to 260) bound to Tctex1 and LC8 (WT IC·Tctex1·LC8) and ICLL·LC8·LC8 complex were in buffer containing 15 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and a final protein complex concentration of 0.2 mm. Crystals were obtained at 4 °C using hanging drops setup with a 1-μl protein and reservoir solution equilibrated against a 400-μl reservoir. For WT IC·Tctex1·LC8, hexagonal pyramidal crystals were obtained using a reservoir of 16% PEG 8000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, 200 mm calcium acetate, pH 6.5. Crystals grew to a final size of 0.16 × 0.16 × 0.3 mm3. For ICLL·LC8·LC8, blade-shaped crystals were obtained using 30% PEG 400, 100 mm Hepes, 200 mm magnesium chloride, pH 7.5. Crystals grew to a final size of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.5 mm3 (supplemental Table S2). Crystals for both complexes were analyzed by SDS gel after data collection and showed that the full-length IC constructs were proteolyzed. Therefore both complexes contain an IC domain of unknown length N- and C-terminal to the Tctex1 and LC8 binding sites. IC is natively disordered and sensitive to protease degradation, it seems likely that formation of the crystal lattice occurred opportunistically during in situ proteolysis (26.Dong A. Xu X.

Crystals were pulled through oil before flash-freezing in loops using liquid nitrogen. For WT IC·Tctex1·LC8, 3.5-Å resolution oscillation data (Δϕ = 1.0°) were collected at the Berkeley Advanced Light Source, HHMI beam line 8.2.2. For ICLL·LC8·LC8, 3.15-Å resolution oscillation data were collected using an in-house Raxis IV system with CuKα radiation. Data were integrated using Imosflm (27.Leslie A. Joint CCP4+ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 6Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALA (28.Diederichs K. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The WT IC·Tctex1·LC8 and ICLL·LC8·LC8 space groups were P62 with unit cell of a = b = 115.66, c = 90.37 Å and P6122 with a = b = 44.65, c = 219.38, respectively. Phases were determined for both crystals by molecular replacement using PHASER (29.McCoy A.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) and 2PG1 and 3BRI as search models. The WT IC·Tctex1·LC8 crystal had a full IC·Tctex1·LC8 complex (six protein chains) in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement placed a dimer of Tctex1 and a dimer of LC8 allowing an electron density map to be calculated that showed density for the IC peptides. IC residues were manually added using Coot (30.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22401) Google Scholar) and the complex was refined using REFMAC (31.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13681) Google Scholar). The ICLL·LC8·LC8 crystal had just one-fourth of the ICLL·LC8·LC8 complex (one LC8 chain and one-half of an ICLL chain) in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement placed a protomer of LC8 in the cell and the resulting electron density map revealed density for the portion of IC interacting with LC8 and weaker density for the five-residue IC linker connecting LC8 protomers in adjacent unit cells. The five IC linker residues, modeled in an extended PII conformation, fit well in the distance between the LC8 dimers and improved Rfree. The linker IC residues were modeled at half-occupancy because only half of the unit cells should contain these residues. For both structures one domain per chain was used for TLS refinement. Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S2. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for WT IC·Tctex1·LC8 and ICLL·LC8·LC8 have been deposited into the PDB with accession numbers 3FM7 and 3GLW. Three IC constructs were used (Fig. 1b): ICTL, a wild-type sequence corresponding to IC residues 84–143 with both Tctex1 and LC8 recognition sequences (T and L refer to sites for binding Tctex1 and LC8, respectively); ICLL, a mutated version of the same segment with the Tctex1 recognition sequence replaced by the LC8 recognition sequence; and ICL, a shortened sequence corresponding to IC residues 123–138 with only one LC8 recognition sequence. The ICTL, ICLL, and ICL constructs do not include the IC regions predicted to be coiled-coils (13.Benison G. Nyarko A. Barbar E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Tctex1 and LC8 bind the longer IC constructs that contain either predicted coiled-coil with similar affinity as ICTL (data not shown) and therefore for simplicity and for ease of comparison of ITC and x-ray crystallography data, these studies focus on ICTL. The apo-IC constructs used are all monomeric and disordered, whereas both Tctex1 and LC8 are dimeric and bind two monomers of IC. When fully assembled, the complexes formed by the IC constructs are, respectively, ICTL·Tctex1·LC8, ICLL·LC8·LC8, and ICL·LC8. Representative isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data are shown in Fig. 2. Association parameters (ΔG0, ΔH0, −TΔS0) and the related heat capacity change (ΔCpexp) are given in Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2. For ICTL, we measured the binding of Tctex1 to both apo-ICTL and the pre-bound ICTL·LC8 complex and similarly the binding of LC8 to apo-ICTL and to pre-bound ICTL·Tctex1. Control experiments showed that in the absence of IC there is no interaction between Tctex1 and LC8 (data not shown).TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for association of IC constructs with dimeric LC8 and Tctex1 at 25 °CInteractionKdΔG0ΔH0−TΔS0ΔCpexpΔCpcalcaΔCpcal values were computed as described by Spolar and Record (24) based on the surfaces buried by a light chain monomer binding to a single IC chain.ProteinLigandμmkcal/molkcal/mol/KLC8ICL8.0 ± 2.1−7.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.3−8.1 ± 0.4−0.26−0.27Tctex1ICTL9.6 ± 3.6−6.8 ± 0.2−6.9 ± 0.80.1 ± 0.5−0.42−0.56bNo structure is reported for IC with Tctex1 in the absence of LC8, so ΔCpcalc for apo-ICTL·Tctex1 was determined from the WT IC·Tctex1·LC8 complex (PDB 3FM7).LC8ICTL8.0 ± 1.5−7.0 ± 0.1−13.7 ± 0.66.7 ± 0.2−0.26−0.27Tctex1ICTL·LC80.21 ± 0.09−9.1 ± 0.2−8.8 ± 0.3−0.3 ± 0.7−0.59−0.56LC8ICTL·Tctex10.13 ± 0.09−9.4 ± 0.3−14.5 ± 0.35.2 ± 0.4−0.41−0.25LC8ICLL0.50 ± 0.06−9.0 ± 0.1−13.7 ± 0.24.8 ± 0.2−0.26−0.25a ΔCpcal values were computed as described by Spolar and Record (24.Spolar R.S.

Open table in a new tab Apo-ICTL binds Tctex1 or LC8 with a similar affinity (Kd of 8 μm), and a ΔCpexp of −0.42 and −0.26 kcal/mol/K, respectively (see Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2, b and c). When ICTL is pre-bound to either Tctex1 or LC8, the second light chain binds with higher affinity (Kd of 0.2 μm), and results in a more negative ΔCpexp of −0.59 and −0.41 kcal/mol/K, for Tctex1 and LC8, respectively (see Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2, d and e). Between the first and second binding events, there is a 50-fold (ΔΔG0 of −2.4 kcal/mol) binding affinity enhancement accompanied by a change in ΔCpexp (ΔΔCpexp of −0.16 kcal/mol/K). The more negative ΔCpexp suggests additional burial of surface area that accompanies the second binding event (24.Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LC8 binds ICL and apo-ICTL with indistinguishable affinities and ΔCpexp values (see Table 1), indicating that binding is limited to the short recognition sequence of IC and that there is no change in rigidity solvent accessible surface area in regions of IC not in direct contact with LC8. To examine the origin of the binding enhancement associated with pre-bound ICTL relative to apo-ICTL we engineered an IC construct, ICLL, which has the Tctex1 binding site replaced with the LC8 recognition sequence, giving two sites for binding dimeric LC8 (see Fig. 1b). ICLL serves a dual purpose, allowing the investigation of the thermodynamics of binding enhancement in a simplified system, and also probing the biological relevance of two contiguous sites on IC for two distinct proteins, Tctex1 and LC8, instead of two copies of a single protein given that there exists real protein systems with two or more adjacent LC8 sites. The latter point is intriguing because Tctex1 and LC8 are homologs with similar tertiary and quaternary structures (supplemental Fig. S1), and similar binding affinity to IC. Binding of ICLL to LC8 to form ICLL·LC8·LC8 was measured using ITC. For strong positive enhancement, as expected between the first and second LC8 dimer binding, ITC cannot resolve individual binding events, so the data were fit to a single binding event with a macroscopic Kd of 0.5 μm and a stoichiometry of two ICLL chains per two LC8 dimers (see Fig. 2e and supplemental Fig. S2f). The single binding event model with ΔG0 of −9.0 kcal/mol, ΔH0 of −13.7, −TΔS0 of 4.8 kcal/mol, and a ΔCpexp of −0.26 kcal/mol/K corresponds to the average of the two binding events. However, distinct thermodynamic parameters for each binding event can be separated if the first binding is assumed to have thermodynamic parameters similar to LC8 binding to apo-ICTL. This assumption is reasonable because the value for ΔCpexp of −0.26 kcal/mol/K for LC8 with ICLL is the same as for LC8 with ICL and apo-ICTL (see Table 1). Using this reasoning, the inferred thermodynamic parameters for the second binding event are a Kd of 0.01 μm, ΔG0 of −11.0, ΔH0 of −13.7, −TΔS0 of 2.8 kcal/mol, and a ΔCpexp of −0.26 kcal/mol/K. The inferred enhanced affinity for the second binding of LC8 to ICLL is considerably higher than that of the second light chain binding to ICTL, and corresponds to a 1000-fold (ΔΔG0 of −4.0 kcal/mol) enhancement, arising solely from a favorable change in entropy Δ(−TΔS0) of −4.0 kcal/mol in the 20–35 °C temperature range (see Table 1). The crystal structure of a fragment of IC bound to Tctex1 and LC8 solved at 3.5 Å resolution shows homodimers of Tctex1 and LC8 binding two chains of IC (residues 109–135) as extended β-strands in the ligand binding grooves (Fig. 3a): IC residues 110–122 interact directly with Tctex1, IC residues 123–125 link the Tctex1 and LC8 binding sites, and IC residues 126–135 contact LC8. The IC linker adopts an extended polyproline-II (PII) conformation and no direct IC·IC or light chain·light chain interactions occur. The crystal structure of ICLL·LC8·LC8 solved at 3.15-Å resolution shows a 4:2 stoichiometric complex in which two chains of ICLL (residues 111–135) are brought together by two LC8 dimers with a linker region consisting of five ICLL residues separating the LC8 dimers (Fig. 3c). The longer exposed linker observed in this structure reflects the shorter IC·LC8 interface relative to the IC·Tctex1 interface in the WT complex. Although there is visible density for ICLL residues within the linker region, there is no density for residues N- or C-terminal to the LC8 recognition sequences. As with the WT IC·Tctex1·LC8 complex, the ICLL linker adopts a PII conformation and has no IC/IC or light chain/light chain contacts. Three constructs, ICLL having binding sites for two LC8 subunits, ICTL having binding sites for Tctex1 and LC8, and ICL having a single LC8 binding site, provide a powerful system for quantitatively dissecting bivalency effects in this multicomponent assembly complex. The full thermodynamic cycle for ICTL ternary complex formation is shown in Fig. 4 along with the corresponding binding steps in ICLL and ICL. The second light chain binds ICTL·LC8 or ICTL·Tctex1 with affinity enhancement of about 50-fold (ΔΔG0 of −2.4 kcal/mol). This is consistent with and extends a hydrogen exchange study that indicated enhanced binding of at least 10-fold for the second light chain, i.e. ΔΔG0 ≤ −1.4 kcal/mol (15.Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LC8 binds ICLL·LC8 with affinity enhancement of about 1000-fold (ΔΔG0 of −4.0 kcal/mol). The 1000-fold affinity enhancement of the second LC8 binding to ICLL agrees well with a 3-order of magnitude enhancement estimated from calculations of the entropic barrier to binding in bivalent small molecules (32.Murray C.W. Verdonk M.L. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2002; 16: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is due entirely to a favorable change in the association entropy with a minimal enthalpic change between the first and second binding events (ΔΔH0 ≈ 0) (Fig. 5a). This enhancement is an entropic multivalency effect known in a number of biological systems as the chelate effect (33.Bertozzi C.R. Kiessling L.L. Science. 2001; 291: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 34.Mammen M. Choi S. Whitesides G.M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Jencks W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). The first LC8 dimer connects two equivalent ICLL chains resulting in a bivalent ICLL duplex that has significantly higher binding affinity for the second LC8 dimer than for the first (supplemental Fig. S3). The second binding event is of higher affinity because the unfavorable loss of translational and rotational entropy is fully paid in the first binding step, so that the subsequent binding step does not incur this entropic penalty. The enhancement in the ICLL·LC8 system is a remarkable demonstration of the solely entropic origin of the chelate effect in a multisubunit protein assembly. It suggests that the alignment of the two IC arms is optimal for the second LC8 binding. The 50-fold affinity enhancement of LC8 with ICTL·Tctex1 is less than the"
https://openalex.org/W2010198692,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are continuously generated in genomic DNA. Left unrepaired, AP sites represent noninstructional premutagenic lesions that are impediments to DNA synthesis. When DNA polymerases encounter an AP site, they generally insert dAMP. This preferential insertion is referred to as the A-rule. Crystallographic structures of DNA polymerase (pol) beta, a family X polymerase, with active site mismatched nascent base pairs indicate that the templating (i.e. coding) base is repositioned outside of the template binding pocket thereby diminishing interactions with the incorrect incoming nucleotide. This effectively produces an abasic site because the template pocket is devoid of an instructional base. However, the template pocket is not empty; an arginine residue (Arg-283) occupies the space vacated by the templating nucleotide. In this study, we analyze the kinetics of pol beta insertion opposite an AP site and show that the preferential incorporation of dAMP is lost with the R283A mutant. The crystallographic structures of pol beta bound to gapped DNA with an AP site analog (tertrahydrofuran) in the gap (binary complex) and with an incoming nonhydrolyzable dATP analog (ternary complex) were solved. These structures reveal that binding of the dATP analog induces a closed polymerase conformation, an unstable primer terminus, and an upstream shift of the templating residue even in the absence of a template base. Thus, dATP insertion opposite an abasic site and dATP misinsertions have common features."

However, the host's compartmentalization of large amounts of iron in heme, which is bound primarily by hemoglobin in red blood cells, acts as a barrier to bacterial iron assimilation. Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of the disease anthrax, secretes two NEAT (near iron transporter) proteins, IsdX1 and IsdX2, which scavenge heme from host hemoglobin and promote growth under low iron conditions. The mechanism of heme transfer from these hemophores to the bacterial cell is not known. We present evidence that the heme-bound form of IsdX1 rapidly and directionally transfers heme to IsdC, a NEAT protein covalently attached to the cell wall, as well as to IsdX2. In both cases, the transfer of heme is mediated by a physical association between the donor and recipient. Unlike Staphylococcus aureus, whose NEAT proteins acquire heme from hemoglobin directly at the bacterial surface, B. anthracis secretes IsdX1 to capture heme in the extracellular milieu and relies on NEAT-NEAT interactions to deliver the bound heme to the envelope via IsdC. Understanding the mechanism of NEAT-mediated iron transport into pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria may provide an avenue for the development of therapeutics to combat infection.

https://openalex.org/W2129933587,"To identify metabolic pathways involved in hepatic lipoapoptosis, metabolic flux analysis using [U-(13)C(5)]glutamine as an isotopic tracer was applied to quantify phenotypic changes in H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells treated with either palmitate alone (PA-cells) or both palmitate and oleate in combination (PA/OA-cells). Our results indicate that palmitate inhibited glycolysis and lactate dehydrogenase fluxes while activating citric acid cycle (CAC) flux and glutamine uptake. This decoupling of glycolysis and CAC fluxes occurred during the period following palmitate exposure but preceding the onset of apoptosis. Oleate co-treatment restored most fluxes to their control levels, resulting in steatotic lipid accumulation while preventing apoptosis. In addition, palmitate strongly increased the cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH ratio, whereas oleate co-treatment had the opposite effect on cellular redox. We next examined the influence of amino acids on these free fatty acid-induced phenotypic changes. Increased medium amino acids enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis in PA-cells but not in PA/OA-cells. Overloading the medium with non-essential amino acids induced apoptosis, but essential amino acid overloading partially ameliorated apoptosis. Glutamate was the most effective single amino acid in promoting ROS. Amino acid overloading also increased cellular palmitoyl-ceramide; however, ceramide synthesis inhibitors had no effect on measurable indicators of apoptosis. Our results indicate that free fatty acid-induced ROS generation and apoptosis are accompanied by the decoupling of glycolysis and CAC fluxes leading to abnormal cytosolic redox states. Amino acids play a modulatory role in these processes via a mechanism that does not involve ceramide accumulation."

There are two major pathways to repair DSBs, the non-homologous end-joining pathway and the homologous recombination (HR) pathway (3.Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M.

It is believed that during HR, the DNA ends are first resected in the 5′–3′ direction by nucleases. The resulting single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is rapidly bound by replication protein A (RPA). Subsequently, RAD51, a key recombinase enzyme, displaces RPA·ssDNA complexes with the help of its accessory factors to form a helical nucleoprotein filament that permits strand invasion and homology search. At the same time, the ssDNA-bound RPA can also recruit ATR, which phosphorylates CHK1 to trigger and activate cell cycle checkpoints (4.Zou L. Elledge S.J.

The sequence of RAD51 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was CUAAUCAGGUGGUAGCUCAUU; the sequence of NBS1 siRNA was CCAACUAAAUUGCCAAGUAUU; the sequence of MRE11 siRNA was GGAGGUACGUCGUUUCAGAdTdT; and the sequence of RAD50 siRNA was ACAAGGAUCUGGAUAUUUAUU. The siRNA for CtIP and siRNA-resistant wild-type CtIP constructs were described previously (16.Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). siRNA transfection was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. All cDNAs were subcloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) as entry clones and subsequently transferred to Gateway-compatible destination vectors for N-terminal FLAG- or Myc-tagged fusion protein expression. All point or deletion mutants were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. Cells were lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 30 min. Cleared cell lysates were then collected and boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween and then probed with antibodies as indicated. Cells cultured on coverslips were treated with IR radiation, followed by recovery. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pre-extracted with 0.5% Triton solution for 5 min, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 12 min. Coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then immunostained with primary antibodies in 5% goat serum for 60 min. Coverslips were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate for 60 min. Cells were then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize nuclear DNA. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with antifade solution and visualized using a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope with a Nikon Plan Fluor 40× oil objective lens (numerical aperture of 1.30) at room temperature. Cells were photographed and analyzed using a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) and Photoshop software (Adobe). G2/M checkpoint assay was performed as described previously (29.Lou Z. Chini C.C. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13599-13602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with 2 grays (Gy) of IR radiation. One hour later, cells were fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol overnight and then stained with anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) antibody and propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentages of cells in mitosis. Wild-type or mutant CtIP was transferred into pEF1A-HA/FLAG retroviral vector using the Gateway system. Retroviral vectors were cotransfected with pCL-Ampho into BOSC23 packaging cells for virus production. Virus was collected 48 and 72 h after transfection and subsequently used to infect mouse embryonic fibroblasts or U2OS or HeLa cells. Two days after the last infection, cells were collected for experiments or selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin for establishing stable clones. A U2OS cell clone stably expressing HR reporter DR-GFP was described previously (30.Weinstock D.M. Nakanishi K. Helgadottir H.R. Jasin M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 524-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This reporter consists of two differentially mutated green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes oriented as direct repeats. Expression of I-SceI endonuclease will generate a site-specific DSB between the mutated GFP genes, which, when repaired by gene conversion, results in a functional GFP gene. Briefly, 2 days after transfection with siRNA, 1 × 106 U2OS/DR-GFP cells were electroporated with 20 μg of pCBASce (an I-SceI expression vector). For HeLa cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant CtIP, 1 × 106 HeLa cells were electroporated with 15 μg of pCBASce together with 15 μg of DR-GFP. Cells were harvested 2 days after electroporation and subjected to flow cytometry analysis to determine percentages of GFP-positive cells, which result from HR repair induced by DNA DSBs. Samples were analyzed in a BD Biosciences FACScan on a green (FL1) versus orange (FL2) fluorescence plot. Recent studies have demonstrated that CtIP promotes ATR activation and HR by mediating DSB resection (18.Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P.

Because the generation of ssDNAs, especially RPA-coated ssDNAs, is believed to be an intermediate step not only for HR repair (31.New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 32.Sugiyama T. Kantake N. Wu Y. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 10.Olson E. Nievera C.J. Liu E. Lee A.Y. Chen L. Wu X. Mol. Cell.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12903-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is expected that all of these functions of CtIP should be linked. Indeed, in agreement with previous reports (16.Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 18.Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), depletion of CtIP in human cells led to defective G2/M checkpoint control (supplemental Fig. 1A), CHK1 activation (supplemental Fig. 1B), and RPA focus formation (supplemental Fig. 1C). To assess HR repair efficiency, we used the HR reporter assay (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) established by Dr. Maria Jasin and colleagues (30.Weinstock D.M. Nakanishi K. Helgadottir H.R. Jasin M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 524-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Following siRNA-mediated knockdown of CtIP, we observed reduced HR repair efficiency compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (supplemental Fig. 1, D–G), confirming that CtIP is required for efficient HR repair. We also evaluated the kinetics of the CtIP and RPA focus formation (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Although γ-H2AX foci emerged rapidly following DNA damage, CtIP focus formation was delayed and reached the peak at ∼4 h. This was followed by RPA focus formation that peaked at ∼8 h after DNA damage. The kinetics of these processes are consistent with the critical role of CtIP in processing DSB ends to form ssDNAs, which are required for subsequent RPA binding. Although CtIP is required for G2/M checkpoint control and the generation of ssDNA regions upon DNA damage, we still do not know precisely how CtIP carries out these functions. To determine which regions of CtIP protein are critically required for its functions, we generated six internal deletion mutants (Fig. 1A). Each mutant was derived from a siRNA-resistant FLAG-tagged CtIP construct so that the mutant could be expressed when endogenous CtIP was depleted by siRNA. HeLa derivative cell lines stably expressing wild-type CtIP or each one of these internal deletion mutants (D1–D6) were generated. Following depletion of endogenous CtIP, we observed a G2/M checkpoint defect, which was rescued by the expression of siRNA-resistant wild-type CtIP (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the CtIP mutants with deletion of either the N or C terminus (mutants D1 and D6) completely lost this G2/M checkpoint function (Fig. 1B). Consistently, the D1 and D6 mutants also failed to promote efficient CHK1 phosphorylation after IR radiation (Fig. 1C). In addition, we also observed diminished IR radiation-induced RPA focus formation (Fig. 1D) and reduced HR repair efficiency (Fig. 1E) in cells expressing only the D1 or D6 mutant. As control, we examined the D1 and D6 mutants and showed that their expression levels were similar to that of endogenous CtIP (supplemental Fig. 3). Together, these data indicate that both termini of CtIP are important for its functions in DNA damage response. CtIP is known to form a complex with MRN and functions in DSB resection (18.Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 19.Chen L. Nievera C.J. Lee A.Y. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7713-7720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear exactly how CtIP associates with the MRN complex. We first examined the binding of CtIP with each MRN component using a baculovirus expression system. Our data show that CtIP could bind to all three MRN components (Fig. 2A). When we used the six internal deletion mutants of CtIP we generated, we found surprisingly that all of them still interacted with NBS1 (data not shown), suggesting that multiple regions of CtIP might be involved in its interaction with the MRN complex. Because our above results indicate the importance of both the N and C termini of CtIP in mediating CtIP functions, we were prompted to check whether N or C terminus of CtIP could independently interact with the MRN complex. We generated four additional deletion mutants of CtIP as shown in Fig. 2B. N160 contains the first 160 residues of CtIP (residues 1–160), and C166 consists of the last 166 residues of CtIP (residues 732–897). N160C166 combines the N-terminal 160 residues with the C-terminal 166 residues, and 161–731 contains the middle region of CtIP. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using SBP-FLAG-tagged NBS1, MRE11, or RAD50 all suggest that although both the N and C termini of CtIP are involved in its binding to the MRN complex, the middle domain of CtIP (residues 161–731) is dispensable for this function (Fig. 2, C–E). Using the baculovirus expression system, we also showed that both the N and C termini of CtIP can interact with each of the three MRN components, whereas the C terminus of CtIP shows slightly higher binding affinity (Fig. 2F). To investigate which region of CtIP is responsible for its IR radiation-induced focus formation, we used the HeLa cell lines that stably produced wild-type or internal deletion mutants (D1–D6) (see Fig. 1) of FLAG-tagged CtIP. Stably expressed FLAG-CtIP readily formed foci in a damage dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 4, A and B). We found that although other mutants could form foci similar to wild-type CtIP following IR treatment, the D1 mutant exhibited uniform nuclear localization before or after IR treatment (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The D1 mutant of CtIP lost residues 18–159 of CtIP (as shown in Fig. 1A). Further mini-deletion analysis revealed that residues 22–45 at the N terminus of CtIP were required for its focus formation upon DNA damage (Fig. 3, B and C). We have shown that the N terminus of CtIP could bind to the MRN complex (Fig. 3). The results that residues 22–45 are required for damage-induced CtIP focus formation prompt us to ask whether residues 22–45 would also be required for MRN binding, which is indeed the case (Fig. 4A). This is entirely consistent with the observation that depletion of any component in the MRN complex led to a reduction of CtIP focus formation (supplemental Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, we observed that residues 22–45 of CtIP were required for the function of CtIP in damage-induced G2/M checkpoint control (Fig. 4, B and C). Besides the known functions in DNA damage checkpoint control, recent studies have put the MRN·CtIP complex at the center stage of DSB repair mediated by HR. CtIP is believed to function with the MRN complex to process DSB ends and generate ssDNA regions (18.Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P.

We further demonstrated that both the N and C termini of CtIP protein are required for these functions. Our current hypothesis is that these two termini of CtIP have separate functions. The importance of the C terminus of CtIP has been recognized previously because it is highly conserved and required for CtIP function in human cells (18.Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 19.Chen L. Nievera C.J. Lee A.Y. Wu X. J. Biol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 9558-9565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, the role of the N terminus of CtIP was not known until this study. Our current hypothesis is that the N terminus of CtIP binds to MRN and targets CtIP to DNA breaks, and therefore, it is equally important for CtIP function in DNA damage response. In an attempt to determine the key residues within this region (residues 22–45), we aligned the N termini of CtIP from different species and identified several highly conserved residues within this region of CtIP (supplemental Fig. 5A). However, none of the four individual point mutations we generated (H31A, V35A, K41A, and L45A) could abolish CtIP focus formation (supplemental Fig. 5B). Additional mutagenesis and functional studies are needed to elucidate the requirements for CtIP focus formation and its interaction with the MRN complex.

https://openalex.org/W1995328704,"Factor VIII-von Willebrand factor (FVIII.vWF) complex, a molecule involved in coagulation, can be physically associated with osteoprotegerin (OPG). OPG is an anti-osteoclastic protein and a soluble receptor for the proapoptotic protein TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), suggesting a potential role of FVIII.vWF complex in bone and cancer biology. We, thus, assessed the effects of FVIII.vWF complex on osteoclastogenesis and cell survival. We first evidenced that FVIII.vWF complex inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and enhanced the inhibitory effect of OPG. Interestingly, we revealed by surface plasmon resonance that FVIII.vWF complex bound to RANKL, whereas recombinant FVIII and vWF did not. By modeling, we showed that the OPG binding domain to the A1 domain of vWF was closely located and partially overlapped to its binding site to RANKL. Then, we demonstrated that FVIII.vWF complex cancelled the inhibitory activity of OPG on TRAIL-induced apoptosis and characterized interactions between these molecules. The present work evidenced a direct activity of FVIII.vWF complex on osteoclasts and on induced cell apoptosis, pointing out its potential involvement in physiological bone remodeling or in bone damages associated with severe hemophilia and cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2034279569,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most frequent and malignant brain tumors in adults. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are routinely used in the treatment of GBMs for their capacity to reduce the tumor-associated edema. Few in vitro studies have suggested that GCs inhibit the migration and invasion of GBM cells through the induction of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), an endogenous GC antagonist is up-regulated in GBMs. Recently, MIF has been involved in tumor growth and migration/invasion and specific MIF inhibitors have been developed on their capacity to block its enzymatic tautomerase activity site. In this study, we characterized several glioma cell lines for their MIF production. U373 MG cells were selected for their very low endogenous levels of MIF. We showed that dexamethasone inhibits the migration and invasion of U373 MG cells, through a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)- dependent inhibition of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. Oppositely, we found that exogenous MIF increases U373 MG migration and invasion through the stimulation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway and that this activation is CD74 independent. Finally, we used the Hs 683 glioma cells that are resistant to GCs and produce high levels of endogenous MIF, and showed that the specific MIF inhibitor ISO-1 could restore dexamethasone sensitivity in these cells. Collectively, our results indicate an intricate pathway between MIF expression and GC resistance. They suggest that MIF inhibitors could increase the response of GBMs to corticotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2069285318,"4-Hydroxyacids are products of ubiquitously occurring lipid peroxidation (C(9), C(6)) or drugs of abuse (C(4), C(5)). We investigated the catabolism of these compounds using a combination of metabolomics and mass isotopomer analysis. Livers were perfused with various concentrations of unlabeled and labeled saturated 4-hydroxyacids (C(4) to C(11)) or 4-hydroxynonenal. All the compounds tested form a new class of acyl-CoA esters, 4-hydroxy-4-phosphoacyl-CoAs, characterized by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, accurate mass spectrometry, and (31)P-NMR. All 4-hydroxyacids with five or more carbons are metabolized by two new pathways. The first and major pathway, which involves 4-hydroxy-4-phosphoacyl-CoAs, leads in six steps to the isomerization of 4-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs. The latter are intermediates of physiological beta-oxidation. The second and minor pathway involves a sequence of beta-oxidation, alpha-oxidation, and beta-oxidation steps. In mice deficient in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, high plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxybutyrate result in high concentrations of 4-hydroxy-4-phospho-butyryl-CoA in brain and liver. The high concentration of 4-hydroxy-4-phospho-butyryl-CoA may be related to the cerebral dysfunction of subjects ingesting 4-hydroxybutyrate and to the mental retardation of patients with 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria. Our data illustrate the potential of the combination of metabolomics and mass isotopomer analysis for pathway discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2062494105,"Nkx2.2 and NeuroD1 are two critical regulators of pancreatic beta cell development. Nkx2.2 is a homeodomain transcription factor that is essential for islet cell type specification and mature beta cell function. NeuroD1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is critical for islet beta cell maturation and maintenance. Although both proteins influence beta cell development directly downstream of the endocrine progenitor factor, neurogenin3 (Ngn3), a connection between the two proteins in the regulation of beta cell fate and function has yet to be established. In this study, we demonstrate that Nkx2.2 transcriptional activity is required to facilitate the activation of NeuroD1 by Ngn3. Furthermore, Nkx2.2 is necessary to maintain high levels of NeuroD1 expression in developing mouse and zebrafish islets and in mature beta cells. Interestingly, Nkx2.2 regulates NeuroD1 through two independent promoter elements, one that is bound and activated directly by Nkx2.2 and one that appears to be regulated by Nkx2.2 through an indirect mechanism. Together, these findings suggest that Nkx2.2 coordinately activates NeuroD1 with Ngn3 within the endocrine progenitor cell and also plays a role in the maintenance of NeuroD1 expression to regulate beta cell function in the mature islet. Collectively, these findings further define the conserved regulatory networks involved in islet beta cell formation and function."
https://openalex.org/W2025337933,"In the kinesin family, all the molecular motors that have been implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics have been shown to stimulate microtubule depolymerization. Here, we report that kinesin-1 (also known as conventional kinesin or KIF5B) stimulates microtubule elongation and rescues. We show that microtubule-associated kinesin-1 carries the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to allow its activation and that microtubule elongation requires JNK activity throughout the microtubule life cycle. We also show that kinesin-1 and JNK promoted microtubule rescues to similar extents. Stimulation of microtubule rescues by the kinesin-1/JNK pathway could not be accounted for by the rescue factor CLIP-170. Indeed only a dual inhibition of kinesin-1/JNK and CLIP-170 completely blocked rescues and led to extensive microtubule loss. We propose that the kinesin-1/JNK signaling pathway is a major regulator of microtubule dynamics in living cells and that it is required with the rescue factor CLIP-170 to allow cells to build their interphase microtubule network."
https://openalex.org/W2038369617,"The chromatin structure of heat shock protein (HSP)-encoding genes undergoes dramatic alterations upon transcriptional induction, including, in extreme cases, domain-wide nucleosome disassembly. Here, we use a combination of gene knock-out, in situ mutagenesis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and expression assays to investigate the role of histone modification complexes in regulating heat shock gene structure and expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two histone acetyltransferases, Gcn5 and Esa1, were found to stimulate HSP gene transcription. A detailed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the Gcn5-containing SAGA complex (signified by Spt3) revealed its presence within the promoter of every heat shock factor 1-regulated gene examined. The occupancy of SAGA increased substantially upon heat shock, peaking at several HSP promoters within 30-45 s of temperature upshift. SAGA was also efficiently recruited to the coding regions of certain HSP genes (where its presence mirrored that of pol II), although not at others. Robust and rapid recruitment of repressive, Rpd3-containing histone deacetylase complexes was also seen and at all HSP genes examined. A detailed analysis of HSP82 revealed that both Rpd3(L) and Rpd3(S) complexes (signified by Sap30 and Rco1, respectively) were recruited to the gene promoter, yet only Rpd3(S) was recruited to its open reading frame. A consensus URS1 cis-element facilitated the recruitment of each Rpd3 complex to the HSP82 promoter, and this correlated with targeted deacetylation of promoter nucleosomes. Collectively, our observations reveal that SAGA and Rpd3 complexes are rapidly and synchronously recruited to heat shock factor 1-activated genes and suggest that their opposing activities modulate heat shock gene chromatin structure and fine-tune transcriptional output."
https://openalex.org/W2159531143,"A proteomic analysis of proteins bound to the osteocalcin OSE2 sequence of the mouse osteocalcin promoter identified TRPS1 as a regulator of osteocalcin transcription. Mutations in the TRPS1 gene are responsible for human tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome, which is characterized by skeletal and craniofacial abnormalities. TRPS1 has been shown to bind regulatory promoter sequences containing GATA consensus binding sites and to repress transcription of genes involved in chondrocyte differentiation. Here we show that TRPS1 can directly bind the osteocalcin promoter in the presence or absence of Runx2. TRPS1 binds through a GATA binding sequence in the proximal promoter of the osteocalcin gene. The GATA binding site is conserved in mice, humans, and rats, although its location and orientation are not. Mutation of the mouse or human GATA binding sequence abrogates binding of TRPS1 to the osteocalcin promoter. We show that TRPS1 is expressed in osteosarcoma cells and upon induction of osteoblast differentiation in primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells and that TRPS1 regulates the expression of osteocalcin in both cell types. The expression of TRPS1 modulates mineralized bone matrix formation in differentiating osteoblast cells. These data suggest a role for TRPS1 in osteoblast differentiation, in addition to its previously described role in chondrogenesis."

This disorder has no cure or effective treatment and is often fatal. Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of pyridoxine 5′-phosphate to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, the active cofactor form of vitamin B6 required by more than 140 different catalytic activities, including enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. Our aim is to elucidate the mechanism by which a homozygous missense mutation (R229W) in the oxidase, linked to neonatal epileptic encephalopathy, leads to reduced oxidase activity. The R229W variant is ∼850-fold less efficient than the wild-type enzyme due to an ∼192-fold decrease in pyridoxine 5′-phosphate affinity and an ∼4.5-fold decrease in catalytic activity. There is also an ∼50-fold reduction in the affinity of the R229W variant for the FMN cofactor. A 2.5 Å crystal structure of the R229W variant shows that the substitution of Arg-229 at the FMN binding site has led to a loss of hydrogen-bond and/or salt-bridge interactions between FMN and Arg-229 and Ser-175. Additionally, the mutation has led to an alteration of the configuration of a β-strand-loop-β-strand structure at the active site, resulting in loss of two critical hydrogen-bond interactions involving residues His-227 and Arg-225, which are important for substrate binding and orientation for catalysis.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that INT3 plays a key role in the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response, including DNA damage checkpoint activation and DNA damage repair, ensures genomic stability under genotoxic stress. Among various types of DNA damage, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 3The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breakadeno-I-SecIadenovirus-encoded I-SecIco-IPco-immunoprecipitationγH2AXphospho-H2AXGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininINT3Integrator3IRionizing radiationIRIFIR-induced fociMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastOB domainoligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding domainRPAreplication protein AsiRNAsmall interfering RNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNASSB1 and SSB2ssDNA-binding protein 1 and 2, respectively. 3The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breakadeno-I-SecIadenovirus-encoded I-SecIco-IPco-immunoprecipitationγH2AXphospho-H2AXGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininINT3Integrator3IRionizing radiationIRIFIR-induced fociMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastOB domainoligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding domainRPAreplication protein AsiRNAsmall interfering RNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNASSB1 and SSB2ssDNA-binding protein 1 and 2, respectively. are the most deleterious, easily causing chromosomal loss, fusion, and translocation. However, cells can sense and repair DNA DSBs by activating evolutionarily conserved pathways (1Rouse J. Jackson S.P.

Subsequently, phospho-H2AX (γH2AX) provides the platform for accumulation of a larger group of DNA damage response factors, such as MDC1, BRCA1, 53BP1, and TopBP1 (2Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol.

Translocalization of these proteins to the DNA DSBs facilitates DNA damage checkpoint activation by activating downstream Chk1/Chk2 kinases, which arrest the cell cycle at G1, S, or G2 phase (10Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). In addition, it also enhances the efficiency of DNA damage repair by recruiting and stabilizing the DNA repair machinery at the DNA damage sites (11Lisby M. Rothstein R. Curr. Opin.

Among these important mediators, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins play important roles during the DNA damage response. For example, following DNA damage, the MRN complex recognizes DNA DSB ends and processes the blunt ends into ssDNA overhangs (12Takeda S. Nakamura K. Taniguchi Y. Paull T.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 351-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The replication protein A (RPA) complex, a group of ssDNA-binding proteins, immediately coats these ssDNA overhangs and loads and activates the ATR·ATRIP complex at the DNA damage sites (13Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the RPA complex protects ssDNA from nucleolytic resection and facilitates Rad51 filament formation along ssDNA overhangs, which is a key step for homologous recombination repair (14West S.C. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Moreover, RPA70 and RPA32 subunits in the complex could recruit several DNA damage response factors to the DNA damage sites that enhance the efficacy of DNA damage repair (15Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Besides the RPA complex, several other ssDNA-binding proteins have been identified to participate in the DNA damage response recently. One of them is ssDNA-binding protein 1 (SSB1) (16Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Cubeddu L. Wadsworth R.I. Savage K. Sharma G.G. Nicolette M.L. Tsvetanov S. McIlwraith M.J. Pandita R.K. Takeda S. Hay R.T. Gautier J. West S.C. Paull T.T. Pandita T.K. White M.F. Khanna K.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Human SSB1 is a 211-amino acid polypeptide with an N-terminal oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding (OB) domain. It has been shown that SSB1 is phosphorylated by ATM and relocates to the DNA damage site following DNA DSBs. Loss of SSB1 impairs DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation and induces genomic instability. Like the RPA complex, SSB1 participates in homologous recombination by facilitating Rad51·ssDNA filament formation and stabilizing Rad51 at the DNA damage sites. Interestingly, SSB1 has a homolog SSB2 that contains an almost identical OB domain at the N terminus. However, the function of SSB2 in the DNA damage response is not clear yet. To examine the molecular mechanism and functional pathway of SSB1 and SSB2 in the DNA damage response, we have searched for functional partners of SSB1 and SSB2 by using protein affinity purification. We have found Integrator3 (INT3) to be a common partner of both SSB1 and SSB2. Like SSB1, following DNA damage, INT3 relocates to the DNA damage sites and regulates ATR activation. Moreover, INT3 not only participates in DNA damage checkpoint activation but also regulates homologous recombination repair. Taken together, we have found a novel mediator in the DNA damage response. For protein affinity purification and other analyses, full-length cDNA of SSB1, SSB2, or INT3 was cloned into pS-FLAG-SBP vector. For truncation mutants, SSB1, SSB2, or INT3 cDNA fragments were PCR-amplified and cloned into Myc-tagged or HA-tagged vector modified from pcDNA3.1. For GST fusion proteins, INT3 full-length, N1 (amino acids 1–306), N2 (amino acids 1–628), C1 (amino acids 593–1042), or SSB1 full-length was cloned into the pGEX-4T vector. The siRNA sequences targeting SSB1 and SSB2 are CCAACAAGGCGGUGCAGAAdTdT and AGAGUGAACAGAAGAAUAAdTdT, respectively. The sequence of INT3 siRNA is GGACAAAGUACUCCAGCUAdTdT. siRNAs were transfected into the cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit anti-SSB1 and anti-SSB2 antibodies were raised against GST-SSB1 (full-length) or GST-SSB2 (full-length), respectively. Two rabbit anti-INT3 antibodies were raised GST-INT3 (amino acids 1–306) and GST-INT3 (amino acids 593–1042). Anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Covance. Anti-FLAG and anti-β-actin were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Chk1 and phospho-Chk1 (phosphoserine 345) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-53BP1, phospho-H2AX, BRCA1, Rad51, and TopBP1 antibodies have been described previously (17Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 18Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Ward I.M. Minn K. van Deursen J. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Human cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. MDC1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), H2AX-deficient MEFs, 53BP1-deficient MEFs, and RNF8-deficient MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. All of the above cells were cultivated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (v/v). For ionizing radiation (IR), cells were irradiated by using a JL Shepherd 137Cs radiation source at the indicated doses. Cells were lysed with NETN300 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 300 mm NaCl) unless otherwise specified. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed following standard protocol as described previously (20Zhang F. Ma J. Wu J. Ye L. Cai H. Xia B. Yu X. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 524-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Purification of SFB triple-tagged protein was described (20Zhang F. Ma J. Wu J. Ye L. Cai H. Xia B. Yu X. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 524-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 21Kim H. Chen J. Yu X. Science. 2007; 316: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To search for binding partners of SSB1 and SSB2, 1 liter of HEK293T cells stably expressing SFB-SSB1 or SFB-SSB2 was harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with 30 ml of ice-cold NETN300 buffer. The soluble fraction was incubated with 0.5 ml of streptavidin-conjugated beads. The beads were washed three times with NETN300 buffer. Associated proteins were eluted with 2 mm biotin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated further with 50 μl of S beads (Novagen). The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 0.125 m Tris-HCl) and analyzed with SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. 293T cells with empty vector were used as purification controls. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were blocked with 5% goat serum and then incubated with primary antibody for 60 min. Samples were washed three times and incubated with secondary antibody for 30 min. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and visualized by a fluorescence microscope. For SSB1 and INT3 staining, cells were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min before fixation. To examine ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF), cells were cultured on coverslips and treated with 10 Gy of IR followed by recovery for 4 h unless otherwise specified. To count DNA damage-induced foci, we usually choose nine fields from each slide and count 500 cells. To avoid nonspecific staining, cells with at least 3 clear foci were considered as foci-positive cells. To quantify the co-localization of INT3 foci and γH2AX foci, 100 INT3 foci-positive cells were randomly picked up. Pictures were merged by Adobe Photoshop. Every INT3 focus in every cell was examined whether or not it was positively stained with γH2AX. Ten micrograms of anti-SSB1 antibodies was used to immobilize GST-SSB1 onto protein A beads and incubated with 1 μg of GST-INT3 in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. U2OS cells were treated with control siRNA, SSB1 siRNA, or INT3 siRNA. siRNA-treated cells were irradiated with or without IR (2 Gy). After recovery for 1 h, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with rabbit anti-histone H3 phosphoserine 10 antibody, pH 3, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The stained cells were treated with RNase, incubated with propidium iodide, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay was established and modified by Dr. Jasin's group (22Weinstock D.M. Nakanishi K. Helgadottir H.R. Jasin M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 524-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). U2OS cells stabilized with a single copy of DR-GFP were transfected with control siRNA or SSB1 siRNA or INT3 siRNA. siRNA-treated cells were infected by adenovirus-encoded I-SecI (adeno-I-SecI). Cells were harvested 2 days after infection and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The GFP-positive cell population was measured. To explore the functional partner of SSB1 and SSB2, we generated HEK293T cells stably expressing streptavidin-FLAG-S protein (SFB)-tagged SSB1 or SSB2 and used tandem affinity purification to examine the associated proteins of SSB1 and SSB2. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that INT3, a subunit of the Integrator complex, which was reported to associate with RNA polymerase II for RNA 3′ end processing (23Baillat D. Hakimi M.A. Naar A.M. Shilatifard A. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), was present in both SSB1 and SSB2 affinity purifications (supplemental Tables 1 and 2). To validate the interactions between INT3 and SSB1 or SSB2, we first generated anti-SSB1 and anti-SSB2 antibodies. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, anti-SSB1 and anti-SSB2 antibodies recognize special bands around 36 and 28 kDa, respectively. We then performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and reverse co-IP of the endogenous proteins using these antibodies and found that INT3 associated with both SSB1 and SSB2 (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the purification results, in which we did not detect SSB1 from SSB2 affinity purifications and vice versa (supplemental Tables 1 and 2), endogenous SSB1 and SSB2 cannot interact with each other (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that SSB1 and SSB2 form two different complexes with INT3. Because SSB1 has been shown to participate in the DNA damage response, we wonder whether DNA damage affects the interaction between SSB1 and INT3. As shown in Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1, B and C, we only observed a moderate increase of the SSB1·INT3 complex following IR treatment. Given that DNA damage does not modulate the expression of INT3, but SSB1 (Fig. 1B) (16Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Cubeddu L. Wadsworth R.I. Savage K. Sharma G.G. Nicolette M.L. Tsvetanov S. McIlwraith M.J. Pandita R.K. Takeda S. Hay R.T. Gautier J. West S.C. Paull T.T. Pandita T.K. White M.F. Khanna K.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), it is likely that the subtle increase of the SSB1·INT3 complex following DNA damage is due to DNA damage-induced SSB1 expression (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C); and the interaction between SSB1 and INT3 occurs constitutively regardless of the DNA damage. A similar constitutive interaction was also observed between SSB2 and INT3 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Because INT3 has been reported as a subunit in the Integrator complex that associates with RNA polymerase II, we explored whether other subunits in the Integrator complex also interact with SSB1. FLAG-tagged INT3, INT11, and INT12 were expressed in HEK293T cells and subjected to co-IP with SSB1 antibody. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2A, only INT3, but not INT11 and INT12, associated with SSB1, indicating that SSB1 specifically interacts with INT3. To examine whether INT3 interacts with INT11 and INT12, we performed co-IP by expressing FLAG-tagged INT3, INT11, and INT12 in HEK293T cells. We were unable to detect the direct association between INT3 and INT11 or INT12 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Moreover, by performing a co-IP assay, we failed to detect any interaction between endogenous INT3 and RNA polymerase II (supplemental Fig. S2C). Taken together, these results indicated that the function of SSB1/SSB2-associated INT3 may be independent of the Integrator complex and RNA processing. To examine which region of INT3 is responsible for the interactions with SSB1, HA-tagged wild-type INT3 and a series of deletion mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells and subjected to co-IP with SSB1 or SSB2 antibodies. Results showed that N1 (deletion of amino acids 1–300) and N2 (deletion of amino acids 1–494) mutants of INT3 failed to associate with SSB1 or SSB2 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, this N-terminal region of INT3 is evolutionary conserved (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that this region could serve as a protein-protein binding motif. To map the INT3-interacting region on SSB1 and SSB2, N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants of SSB1 and SSB2 were generated and examined. As shown in Fig. 2B, the N-terminal OB domain deletion mutants of SSB1 and SSB2 abolish the interaction with INT3, suggesting that the conserved OB domain not only is a ssDNA-binding domain but also interacts with its partners. To examine whether the N terminus of INT3 binds directly to SSB1, we expressed and purified recombinant full-length and the N terminus (amino acids 1–306 and 1–628) and C terminus (amino acids 593–1042) of INT3 and full-length SSB1 in bacteria. SSB1 antibodies were used to immobilize purified full-length SSB1 protein onto protein A beads and then incubated with purified wild-type or mutant INT3 proteins. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-INT3 N-terminal or C-terminal antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2C, full-length and the N terminus of INT3, but not the C terminus of INT3, interacted directly with SSB1 in vitro, suggesting that the N terminus of INT3, but not the C terminus INT3, interacts directly with SSB1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that INT3 is a binding partner of SSB1. It has been shown that SSB1 relocated to the DNA damage sites and co-localized with γH2AX following IR treatment (16Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Cubeddu L. Wadsworth R.I. Savage K. Sharma G.G. Nicolette M.L. Tsvetanov S. McIlwraith M.J. Pandita R.K. Takeda S. Hay R.T. Gautier J. West S.C. Paull T.T. Pandita T.K. White M.F. Khanna K.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because INT3 is a binding partner of SSB1, we examined IRIF formation of INT3. As shown in Fig. 3A, INT3, like SSB1, formed IRIF and co-localized with γH2AX, indicating that INT3 and SSB1 may function together in the DNA damage response. To examine which region targets INT3 to the DNA damage sites, we have examined the IRIF of INT3 deletion mutants. Interestingly, C-terminal deletion mutations significantly disrupted the IRIF of INT3, although N-terminal truncation mutations also impaired the foci formation of INT3. Moreover, when both N and C termini of INT3 are deleted, the foci formation of INT3 was completely abolished (Fig. 3B), suggesting that both N and C termini of INT3 are important for foci formation of INT3 after DNA damage. Similarly, we also examined the IRIF of SSB1 mutants and found that the OB domain of SSB1 is essential to target SSB1 to the DNA damage sites (Fig. 3B). Down-regulation of INT3 by siRNA modestly abrogated the IRIF of SSB1 (Fig. 3C). Meanwhile, knockdown SSB1 and SSB2 together also impaired the IRIF of INT3 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the interaction between INT3 and SSB1 could be important to stabilize each other at the DNA damage sites. Following DNA damage, H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated on chromatin surrounding DNA lesions by ATM, ATR, and DNAPK, subsequently providing the platform to recruit and stabilize MDC1 and RNF8 at DSBs (2Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 9Fernandez-Capetillo O. Allis C.D. Nussenzweig A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This pathway regulates several downstream proteins to the DNA damage sites, such as 53BP1 and the RAP80·BRCA1 complex (2Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). To examine the potential position of INT3 in the DNA damage response pathway, we have examined the IRIF of INT3 in several DNA damage response-deficient cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the IRIF of INT3 was abolished in H2AX-, MDC1-, and RNF8-deficient cells, but was intact in the BRCA1- and 53BP1-deficient cells, suggesting that H2AX, MDC1, and RNF8 are important for recruiting or stabilizing INT3 at the DNA damage sites. To examine whether INT3 acts upstream of BRCA1 and 53BP1 following DNA damage, we examined the IRIF of BRCA1 and 53BP1 in the INT3 knockdown cells and found that BRCA1 IRIF, but not 53BP1 IRIF, was impaired by depleting INT3 (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S4). Moreover, the IRIF of TopBP1 was significantly disrupted by INT3 siRNA treatment (Fig. 4B). TopBP1 is one of the factors to activate the ATR pathway following DNA damage (24Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 25Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. Nat. Rev. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Thus, our results indicate that INT3 might be important for ATR activation following DNA damage. In addition, down-regulation of INT3 by siRNA does not affect the mRNA level of BRCA1, TopBP1, and 53BP1 (supplemental Fig. S5). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IRIF of INT3 is controlled by H2AX, MDC1, and RNF8; INT3 is important for the IRIF of TopBP1 and BRCA1. Because INT3 might be involved in ATR activation and SSB1 has been shown to regulate Chk1 phosphorylation (16Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Cubeddu L. Wadsworth R.I. Savage K. Sharma G.G. Nicolette M.L. Tsvetanov S. McIlwraith M.J. Pandita R.K. Takeda S. Hay R.T. Gautier J. West S.C. Paull T.T. Pandita T.K. White M.F. Khanna K.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we have examined the role of INT3 in ATR-dependent signaling. As shown in Fig. 5A, knockdown INT3 abolished DNA damage-induced Ser345 phosphorylation of Chk1, which is a surrogate marker of Chk1 activation (26Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Lopez-Girona A. Tanaka K. Chen X.B.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Because Chk1 controls activation of several checkpoints following DNA damage, including G2/M checkpoint activation, loss of Chk1 activation abrogates the G2/M checkpoint (26Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Lopez-Girona A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the role of INT3 in G2/M checkpoint activation using a previously established G2/M checkpoint assay (21Kim H. Chen J. Yu X. Science. 2007; 316: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, a normal cell with a G2/M checkpoint is arrested at the G2/M transition to allow DNA lesions to be repaired. Mitotic cells (marked by phosphohistone H3) are significantly reduced. If the G2/M checkpoint is abolished, cells could not be arrested at the G2/M transition following DNA damage. The mitotic population will not change as dramatically as that in control cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, when cells were treated with a control siRNA, their mitotic population was dramatically reduced (from 1.1% to 0.2%) after treatment with 2 Gy of IR, suggesting that the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint is activated and blocks the cell cycle at the G2/M transition. In contrast, in cells treated with either SSB1 siRNA or INT3 siRNA, the mitotic fractions are just slightly reduced after IR, suggesting that the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint is disrupted in the absence of either SSB1 or INT3. These data suggest that SSB1 and INT3 are essential for normal DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint activation. Similar to the RPA complex, SSB1 has been shown to facilitate Rad51 and ssDNA to form nucleoprotein filament and to regulate homologous recombination repair (16Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Cubeddu L. Wadsworth R.I. Savage K. Sharma G.G. Nicolette M.L. Tsvetanov S. McIlwraith M.J. Pandita R.K. Takeda S. Hay R.T. Gautier J. West S.C. Paull T.T. Pandita T.K. White M.F. Khanna K.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined whether INT3 affects Rad51 foci formation after IR. As shown in Fig. 6A, depletion of INT3 dramatically reduced the IRIF of Rad51. To examine the role of INT3 in the homologous recombination, we used an I-SceI-dependent GFP reporter assay to measure homologous recombination in SSB1- or INT3-delepted cells. This assay depends on the reconstitution of GFP as a consequence of repairing an I-SceI-induced DSB (29Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). I-Sce1 is a yeast DNA restriction enzyme but does not have any restriction site in whole human genomic DNA. A plasmid (DR-GFP reporter construct) with two mutant GFP genes (mGFP1 and mGFP2) was stably transfected into U2OS cells. These two mutant GFP genes contain different mutations and will not produce wild-type GFP that transmits green fluorescence. One of these two mutant GFP genes (mGFP1) harbors a unique I-Sce1 site (mGFP1). I-Sce1 will generate a DSB in mGFP1. By using another mutant GFP gene (mGFP2) as a template, this break in mGFP1 will be repaired by endogenous homologous recombination machinery, and a wild-type GFP will be generated and excite green fluorescence. Homologous recombination-positive cells can be measured by flow cytometry. After double-transfected SSB1 siRNA, INT3 siRNA, or control siRNA, U2OS cells that stably integrated a DR-GFP reporter construct were infected by adeno-I-SecI. Forty-eight hours after infection, the cells were harvested, and the number of GFP-positive cells was assessed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 6B, the GFP-positive population was raised from 0.1% to 11.3% following I-SceI expression in the cells treated with control siRNA, suggesting that I-SceI-induced homologous recombination repair is activated in the cells treated with control siRNA. However, compared with control siRNA-treated cells, the GFP-positive population was dramatically reduced in the cells treated with SSB1 siRNA or INT3 siRNA, suggesting that I-SceI-induced homologous recombination repair is abrogated in the absence of SSB1 and INT3. Taken together, these results suggest that INT3, like SSB1, plays an important role in homologous recombination. SSB1 plays a major role in the DNA damage response. Here, we have identified INT3 as a functional partner of SSB1 in the DNA damage response. The SSB1·INT3 complex regulates both DNA damage checkpoint activation and DNA damage repair. Like SSB1, INT3 relocates to DNA lesions following IR. Regarding the DNA damage-induced foci formation, INT3 is downstream of H2AX, MDC1, and RNF8, but upstream of TopBP1, which is important to activate ATR kinase following DNA damage. By examining Chk1 phosphorylation, we found that INT3 regulates ATR-dependent signaling, which mediates DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints. The IRIF of TopBP1 is dependent on its BRCT domain (18Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), a phosphoprotein-binding module (17Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Although we do not detect TopBP1 during the protein affinity purification, it is possible that other mediators may exist between the SSB1·INT3 complex and TopBP1 following DNA damage. Moreover, TopBP1 has been shown to associate with BRCA1 (30Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B. Pathania S. Cantor S.B. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is likely that INT3 modulates a TopBP1·BRCA1 complex following DNA damage. Alternatively, INT3 may indirectly regulate BRCA1 through TopBP1-dependent ATR activation. Both SSB1 and INT3 are important for Rad51 IRIF and Rad51-mediated homologous recombination repair. Because SSB1 recognizes ssDNA, as proposed, this complex could be important to stabilize Rad51 at the DNA lesions and facilitate Rad51 ssDNA filament formation (16Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Cubeddu L. Wadsworth R.I. Savage K. Sharma G.G. Nicolette M.L. Tsvetanov S. McIlwraith M.J. Pandita R.K. Takeda S. Hay R.T. Gautier J. West S.C. Paull T.T. Pandita T.K. White M.F. Khanna K.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Future structural analysis will reveal how Rad51 fits in or replace SSB1·INT3 at 3′ overhangs at the lesions. Recently, similar findings reported by two other groups further confirmed the role of the SSB1 complex in the DNA damage response, especially homologous combination repair (31Huang J. Gong Z. Ghosal G. Chen J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 384-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 32Li Y. Bolderson E. Kumar R. Muniandy P.A. Xue Y. Richard D.J. Seidman M. Pandita T.K. Khanna K.K. Wang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23525-23531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Besides SSB1, we also characterized SSB2. It associates with INT3 through the N-terminal ssDNA-binding domain. SSB1 and SSB2 share very similar ssDNA-binding domains at the N terminus, but with distinct C-terminal tails (16Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Cubeddu L. Wadsworth R.I. Savage K. Sharma G.G. Nicolette M.L. Tsvetanov S. McIlwraith M.J. Pandita R.K. Takeda S. Hay R.T. Gautier J. West S.C. Paull T.T. Pandita T.K. White M.F. Khanna K.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Like SSB1, SSB2 interacts with INT3 through its N-terminal OB domain. However, compared with SSB1, the expression of SSB2 is very low in normal culture cells (supplemental Fig. S6). After knockdown SSB2 by siRNA, we could not detect any effect on ATR-dependent signaling, G2/M checkpoint activation, and homologous recombination. Thus, it is possible that SSB2 is merely a redundant homolog of SSB1 during regular DNA damage response and only functions in some special circumstances.

https://openalex.org/W2049401690,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common recessive disorder caused by >1600 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. About 13% of CFTR mutations are classified as “splicing mutations,” but for almost 40% of these, their role in affecting the pre-mRNA splicing of the gene is not yet defined. In this work, we describe a new splicing mutation detected in three unrelated Italian CF patients. By DNA analyses and mRNA studies, we identified the c.1002–1110_1113delTAAG mutation localized in intron 6b of the CFTR gene. At the mRNA level, this mutation creates an aberrant inclusion of a sequence of 101 nucleotides between exons 6b and 7. This sequence corresponds to a portion of intron 6b and resembles a cryptic exon because it is characterized by an upstream ag and a downstream gt sequence, which are most probably recognized as 5′- and 3′-splice sites by the spliceosome. Through functional analysis of this splicing defect, we show that this mutation abolishes the interaction of the splicing regulatory protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 with an intronic splicing regulatory element and creates a new recognition motif for the SRp75 splicing factor, causing activation of the cryptic exon. Our results show that the c.1002–1110_1113delTAAG mutation creates a new intronic splicing regulatory element in intron 6b of the CFTR gene exclusively recognized by SRp75.

A significant fraction (∼13%) of CFTR mutations are classified as “splicing mutations,” but for almost 40% of these, their role in affecting the pre-mRNA splicing of the gene is not yet defined.Splicing mutations act by directly disrupting splice sites or by creating new ones. Varied levels of alternative splicing have been detected for some of the splicing mutations (9Zielenski J. Patrizio P. Corey M. Handelin B. Markiewicz D. Asch R. Tsui L.C. Am. J. Hum.

These differences are most likely due to different utilization of intragenic splicing elements by trans-acting splicing factors (12Nissim-Rafinia M. Chiba-Falek O. Sharon G. Boss A. Kerem B. Hum.

The 3′-splice site is preceded by a polypyrimidine tract of variable length.The branch point is typically located 18–40 nucleotides upstream of the polypyrimidine tract. These splicing signals are essential but do not contain sufficient information to specify correct splicing patterns, and they alone cannot be distinguished from numerous surrounding cryptic splice sites of similar strength (14Cartegni L. Chew S.L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Their efficient recognition, as well as their regulated usage, requires sequences within exons and introns called enhancers and silencers. Pre-mRNA splicing requires the interaction of these critical cis-acting sequences with splicing regulating factors that form the spliceosome. The spliceosome is a highly complex RNA/protein machine consisting of five small nuclear RNAs and >100 proteins such as the SR (serine/arginine-rich) proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), allowing the fine-tuning of the splicing process (15Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 16Nilsen T.W. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17Zhou Z. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 419: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).In classical splicing defects, the cis-acting elements are mutated, and the effect on splicing can be predicted on the basis of genomic DNA sequence analysis. However, the effect of mutations in non-obvious regulatory elements is more difficult to evaluate directly from genome scanning methodologies. Patient CFTR mRNA analysis represents a good tool for the identification and definition of the pathogenic role of sequence variations not yet defined and splicing defects causing alternative products.In this work, we describe three unrelated Italian patients affected by CF whose CFTR mRNA contains an insertion of 101 nucleotides between exons 6b and 7 corresponding to a portion of intron 6b. This sequence resembles a cryptic exon because it is characterized by an upstream ag and a downstream gt sequence, which are most probably recognized as 5′- and 3′-splice sites by the spliceosome. We assume that this anomalous transcript is caused by a mutation affecting an intronic splicing regulatory element that either abolishes or creates specific protein-binding domains, causing an alteration of the intronic splicing process. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the aberrant splicing, we carried out molecular analysis of intron 6b as well as functional studies.DISCUSSIONCF is a common recessive disorder caused by >1600 mutations in the CFTR gene. Despite the extensive mutation characterization work around the world, there is still a substantial fraction of patients with typical clinical diagnosis of CF but unknown mutations in the CFTR gene (28Groman J.D. Meyer M.E. Wilmott R.W. Zeitlin P.L. Cutting G.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). About 13% of CFTR mutations are termed as affecting the pre-mRNA splicing, but for almost 40% of these, their role in affecting the pre-mRNA splicing is not yet defined. Genotype screening in the CFTR gene frequently identifies sequence variations whose association with the disease phenotype is unclear. In fact, the pathologic effect of an apparently benign polymorphism is difficult to assess. For this reason, patient CFTR mRNA analysis represents a good tool for the identification and definition of the pathogenic role of sequence variations not yet defined and splicing defects causing alternative products.In this study, we have described a new splicing mutation detected in three unrelated Italian CF patients. The molecular characterization of these patients was carried out at either the DNA or RNA level. The splicing defect described here abolishes the interaction of hnRNP A2/B1 with an intronic splicing regulatory element and creates a new recognition motif for the SRp75 splicing factor, causing the activation of a cryptic exon. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the SR splicing protein SRp75 has been directly implicated in the creation of a cryptic exon in the CFTR transcript.SR proteins (15Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) are typically involved in positive regulation of splicing, stimulating splicing by interacting with exonic or intronic splicing enhancer elements. In contrast, negative regulation is promoted most frequently by hnRNPs (29Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), which function by binding sequences known as exonic or intronic splicing silencers. Several hnRNPs have been identified as key splicing repressors. Among these, the hnRNP A1 protein has been extensively characterized. The first hnRNP A1-dependent exonic splicing silencer was identified in studies of human immunodeficiency virus Tat exon 2 repression (30Amendt B.A. Si Z.H. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 11: 4606-4615Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 8: 4597-4605Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This exonic splicing silencer was found to bind hnRNP A1, and mutations disrupting the exonic splicing silencer prevented hnRNP A1 binding and allowed enhanced exon 2 splicing.Despite the abundance in the genome of potential pseudoexons (intronic sequences between 50 and 200 nucleotides in length with apparently possible 5′- and 3′-splice sites at either end), their inclusion does not seem to be a frequent event during the normal pre-mRNA processing. It was indeed noted that many of these non-spliced pseudoexons contain multiple defects in splicing-controlling regions despite their apparently good agreement with real exonic sequences (32Sun H. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In accord with this, three putative splicing silencer motifs have been found to be enriched in these non-spliced pseudoexons compared with their surrounding intronic regions (33Fairbrother W.G. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6816-6825Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This observation is in agreement with a study that showed that human DNA is particularly rich in sequences that can inhibit splicing (34Sironi M. Menozzi G. Riva L. Cagliani R. Comi G.P. Bresolin N. Giorda R. Pozzoli U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Many intronic sequences seem to be close to becoming exons because most of the disease-associated pseudoexon inclusion events originate from a single activating mutation. This mutation generally involves the ex novo creation of a strong donor or acceptor site, followed by the subsequent selection of weaker opportunistic acceptor or donor site sequences. However, other mechanisms that cause the inclusion of pseudoexon-activating mutations may also involve the creation or deletion of splicing regulatory elements.There are in fact at least two cases, the α-galactosidase A (35Ishii S. Nakao S. Minamikawa-Tachino R. Desnick R.J. Fan J.Q. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 994-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and ATM (36Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Bendix R. Dörk T. Baralle F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) genes, in which the creation/deletion of splicing regulatory elements has been observed to occur. In the ATM gene, the inclusion of a 65-nucleotide long pseudoexon is the consequence of a 4-nucleotide deletion in ATM intron 20 that disrupts a high affinity U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-binding site located within the pseudoexon sequence itself. This region is called the intronic splicing processing element, and its disruption results in the activation of an immediately upstream cryptic acceptor site and of a downstream cryptic donor site.The splicing mutation affecting the CFTR gene described in this work brings to mind the splicing defect in the ATM gene described by Pagani et al. (36Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Bendix R. Dörk T. Baralle F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In summary, our results indicate that the c.1002–1110_1113delTAAG mutation creates a new intronic splicing regulatory element in intron 6b of the CFTR gene specifically recognized by the splicing factor SRp75. This acts as enhancer that increases the pseudoexon inclusion during the splicing process.We have established that the basic mechanism affecting splicing due to mutation is not always obvious and cannot be simply derived from in silico predictions. The creation of an intronic splicing enhancer may be a common event in human pathology and has to be taken into account to assess the phenotypic risk in CF patients and to devise new therapies.

The molecular characterization of these patients was carried out at either the DNA or RNA level. The splicing defect described here abolishes the interaction of hnRNP A2/B1 with an intronic splicing regulatory element and creates a new recognition motif for the SRp75 splicing factor, causing the activation of a cryptic exon. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the SR splicing protein SRp75 has been directly implicated in the creation of a cryptic exon in the CFTR transcript.SR proteins (15Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) are typically involved in positive regulation of splicing, stimulating splicing by interacting with exonic or intronic splicing enhancer elements. In contrast, negative regulation is promoted most frequently by hnRNPs (29Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), which function by binding sequences known as exonic or intronic splicing silencers. Several hnRNPs have been identified as key splicing repressors. Among these, the hnRNP A1 protein has been extensively characterized. The first hnRNP A1-dependent exonic splicing silencer was identified in studies of human immunodeficiency virus Tat exon 2 repression (30Amendt B.A. Si Z.H. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 11: 4606-4615Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 8: 4597-4605Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This exonic splicing silencer was found to bind hnRNP A1, and mutations disrupting the exonic splicing silencer prevented hnRNP A1 binding and allowed enhanced exon 2 splicing.Despite the abundance in the genome of potential pseudoexons (intronic sequences between 50 and 200 nucleotides in length with apparently possible 5′- and 3′-splice sites at either end), their inclusion does not seem to be a frequent event during the normal pre-mRNA processing. It was indeed noted that many of these non-spliced pseudoexons contain multiple defects in splicing-controlling regions despite their apparently good agreement with real exonic sequences (32Sun H. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In accord with this, three putative splicing silencer motifs have been found to be enriched in these non-spliced pseudoexons compared with their surrounding intronic regions (33Fairbrother W.G. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6816-6825Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This observation is in agreement with a study that showed that human DNA is particularly rich in sequences that can inhibit splicing (34Sironi M. Menozzi G. Riva L. Cagliani R. Comi G.P. Bresolin N. Giorda R. Pozzoli U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Many intronic sequences seem to be close to becoming exons because most of the disease-associated pseudoexon inclusion events originate from a single activating mutation. This mutation generally involves the ex novo creation of a strong donor or acceptor site, followed by the subsequent selection of weaker opportunistic acceptor or donor site sequences. However, other mechanisms that cause the inclusion of pseudoexon-activating mutations may also involve the creation or deletion of splicing regulatory elements.There are in fact at least two cases, the α-galactosidase A (35Ishii S. Nakao S. Minamikawa-Tachino R. Desnick R.J. Fan J.Q. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 994-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and ATM (36Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Bendix R. Dörk T. Baralle F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) genes, in which the creation/deletion of splicing regulatory elements has been observed to occur. In the ATM gene, the inclusion of a 65-nucleotide long pseudoexon is the consequence of a 4-nucleotide deletion in ATM intron 20 that disrupts a high affinity U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-binding site located within the pseudoexon sequence itself. This region is called the intronic splicing processing element, and its disruption results in the activation of an immediately upstream cryptic acceptor site and of a downstream cryptic donor site.The splicing mutation affecting the CFTR gene described in this work brings to mind the splicing defect in the ATM gene described by Pagani et al. (36Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Bendix R. Dörk T. Baralle F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In summary, our results indicate that the c.1002–1110_1113delTAAG mutation creates a new intronic splicing regulatory element in intron 6b of the CFTR gene specifically recognized by the splicing factor SRp75. This acts as enhancer that increases the pseudoexon inclusion during the splicing process.We have established that the basic mechanism affecting splicing due to mutation is not always obvious and cannot be simply derived from in silico predictions. The creation of an intronic splicing enhancer may be a common event in human pathology and has to be taken into account to assess the phenotypic risk in CF patients and to devise new therapies. CF is a common recessive disorder caused by >1600 mutations in the CFTR gene. Despite the extensive mutation characterization work around the world, there is still a substantial fraction of patients with typical clinical diagnosis of CF but unknown mutations in the CFTR gene (28Groman J.D. Meyer M.E. Wilmott R.W. Zeitlin P.L. Cutting G.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). About 13% of CFTR mutations are termed as affecting the pre-mRNA splicing, but for almost 40% of these, their role in affecting the pre-mRNA splicing is not yet defined. Genotype screening in the CFTR gene frequently identifies sequence variations whose association with the disease phenotype is unclear. In fact, the pathologic effect of an apparently benign polymorphism is difficult to assess. For this reason, patient CFTR mRNA analysis represents a good tool for the identification and definition of the pathogenic role of sequence variations not yet defined and splicing defects causing alternative products.

https://openalex.org/W1995508457,"Protein translocation and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves two distinct Hsp70 chaperones, Lhs1p and Kar2p. Both proteins have the characteristic domain structure of the Hsp70 family consisting of a conserved N-terminal nucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal substrate binding domain. Kar2p is a canonical Hsp70 whose substrate binding activity is regulated by cochaperones that promote either ATP hydrolysis or nucleotide exchange. Lhs1p is a member of the Grp170/Lhs1p subfamily of Hsp70s and was previously shown to function as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for Kar2p. Here we show that in addition to this NEF activity, Lhs1p can function as a holdase that prevents protein aggregation in vitro. Analysis of the nucleotide requirement of these functions demonstrates that nucleotide binding to Lhs1p stimulates the interaction with Kar2p and is essential for NEF activity. In contrast, Lhs1p holdase activity is nucleotide-independent and unaffected by mutations that interfere with ATP binding and NEF activity. In vivo, these mutants show severe protein translocation defects and are unable to support growth despite the presence of a second Kar2p-specific NEF, Sil1p. Thus, Lhs1p-dependent nucleotide exchange activity is vital for ER protein biogenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2039260722,"Members of the RecQ family of proteins are highly conserved DNA helicases that have important functions in the maintenance of genomic stability. Deficiencies in RecQ4 have been linked to human diseases including Rothmund-Thomson, RAPADILINO, and Baller-Gerold syndromes, all of which are characterized by developmental defects, tumor propensity, and genetic instability. However, there are conflicting results shown in the literature regarding the DNA helicase activity of RecQ4. We report here the expression of Drosophila melanogaster RecQ4 with a baculoviral vector and its purification to near homogeneity. The purified protein has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity and is a 3′-5′ DNA helicase dependent on hydrolysis of ATP. The presence of 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, promotes stable complex formation between RecQ4 and single-stranded DNA. Drosophila RecQ4 can also anneal complementary single strands; this activity was reduced in the presence of AMPPNP, possibly because of the stable protein-DNA complex formed under such conditions. A point mutation of the highly conserved lysine residue in the helicase domain, although retaining the wild type level of annealing activity, inactivated ATPase and helicase activities and eliminated stable complex formation. These results suggest that the helicase domain alone is responsible for the DNA unwinding action of the Drosophila enzyme. We generated a null recq4 mutant that is homozygous lethal, which we used to test the genetic function of the helicase-dead mutant in flies. Complementation tests showed that the helicase-dead mutant recq4 transgenes are incapable of rescuing the null mutation, demonstrating that the helicase activity has an essential biological function.

DNA helicases are critical to almost all aspects of DNA metabolism. These enzymes unwind double-stranded DNA using the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP or other nucleotide triphosphates. The RecQ family of helicases is of particular interest, as its members not only unwind DNA but also anneal complementary DNA strands (reviewed in Refs. 1Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Chromosoma. 2008; 117: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Seki M. Otsuki M. Ishii Y. Tada S. Enomoto T.

The combination of these two activities can be employed to form and resolve DNA structures that are involved in replication, repair, and recombination. Mutations in this highly conserved family are characterized by increased genetic instability. Three of the five RecQ helicases (Blm, Wrn, and RecQ4) in humans are associated with clinical syndromes. Bloom syndrome, caused by deficiencies in Blm, is defined by abnormally high levels of sister chromatid exchange leading to an increased occurrence of cancer. Mutations in Wrn lead to Werner syndrome, a severe form of progeria. Defects in RecQ4 are responsible for three different syndromes with a diverse set of symptoms. The remaining human RecQ helicases, RecQ1 and RecQ5, are not associated with any diseases but are also implicated in suppressing inappropriate sister chromatid exchange, perhaps serving as backups to Blm (4Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Nakagawa T. Yoshimura A. Otsuki M. Kawabe Y. Tada S. Yagi H. Ishii Y. Enomoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The least characterized of the five human RecQ helicases is RecQ4. Discovered in 1998 (5Kitao S. Ohsugi I. Ichikawa K. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Shimamoto A. Genomics. 1998; 54: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), RecQ4 is now known to be associated with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, RAPADILINO, and Baller-Gerold syndrome (reviewed in Refs. 6Siitonen H.A. Sotkasiira J. Biervliet M. Benmansour A. Capri Y. Cormier-Daire V. Crandall B. Hannula-Jouppi K. Hennekam R. Herzog D. Keymolen K. Lipsanen-Nyman M. Miny P. Plon S.E. Riedl S. Sarkar A. Vargas F.R.

There is significant overlap between the symptoms of these three syndromes, with patients exhibiting some combination of the following: poikiloderma, cataracts, sparse hair, radial ray hypoplasia, gastrointestinal defects, growth retardation, craniosynostosis, palatal abnormalities, joint dislocation, and a higher risk of osteosarcoma and lymphoma. It has been difficult to establish correlations between individual mutations and specific disease symptoms. Nonetheless, certain trends can be observed. Many of the mutations found in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, RAPADILINO, and Baller-Gerold syndrome patients with defects in the RecQ4 gene occur in the helicase domain, often truncating it or excluding it entirely (6Siitonen H.A. Sotkasiira J. Biervliet M. Benmansour A. Capri Y. Cormier-Daire V. Crandall B. Hannula-Jouppi K. Hennekam R. Herzog D. Keymolen K. Lipsanen-Nyman M. Miny P. Plon S.E. Riedl S. Sarkar A. Vargas F.R. Verloes A. Wang L.L. Kääriäinen H. Kestilä M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mouse mutants with partial or complete deletions of the helicase domain recapitulate to varying degrees the symptoms of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and RAPADILINO patients, including small stature, skin abnormalities, radial ray defects, and cancer predisposition (9Hoki Y. Araki R. Fujimori A. Ohhata T. Koseki H. Fukumura R. Nakamura M. Takahashi H. Noda Y. Kito S. Abe M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2293-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Mann M.B. Hodges C.A. Barnes E. Vogel H. Hassold T.J. Luo G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that defects within the helicase domain may be responsible for many of the phenotypes found in RecQ4-related syndromes. The cellular functions of RecQ4 remain to be elucidated. In Drosophila, the enzyme plays an essential role in replication, where homozygous null mutants do not survive past the first instar because of severe defects in replication, and a hypomorphic mutant is defective in chorion gene amplification at the stage of replication initiation (11Wu J. Capp C. Feng L. Hsieh T.S. Dev. Biol. 2008; 323: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 200 residues are homologous to Sld2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; this domain is necessary for in vitro replication initiation in Xenopus egg extracts (12Sangrithi M.N. Bernal J.A.

Commun. 2006; 345: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy may be because of the cell-specific or cell cycle-dependent differential localization of RecQ4. In mitotic cells during early Drosophila embryogenesis, RecQ4 is localized to the nucleus in interphase, dispersed to the cytoplasm during prophase after nuclear envelope breakdown, and then reimported to the nucleus in telophase (11Wu J. Capp C. Feng L. Hsieh T.S. Dev. Biol. 2008; 323: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent results showed that post-translational modification such as acetylation can promote the cytoplasmic localization of RecQ4 (20Dietschy T. Shevelev I. Pena-Diaz J. Huhn D. Kuenzle S. Mak R. Miah M.F. Hess D. Fey M. Hottiger M.O. Janscak P. Stagljar I. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The enzyme has also been observed to relocate from the cytoplasm to nuclear foci in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome-derived fibroblasts fail to recover after induction of cell growth arrest (19Werner S.R. Prahalad A.K. Yang J. Hock J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). RecQ4 is also known to participate in the repair of double strand breaks and in recovery after treatment with UV light or hydroxyurea (15Fan W. Luo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29037-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Petkovic M. Dietschy T. Freire R. Jiao R. Stagljar I. J.

Taken together, these results suggest that RecQ4 is critically involved in many aspects of DNA repair and replication. There have been conflicting reports concerning the activity of the RecQ4 helicase domain. Both Yin et al. (16Yin J. Kwon Y.T. Varshavsky A. Wang W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Macris et al. (22Macris M.A. Krejci L. Bussen W. Shimamoto A. Sung P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have demonstrated DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP by human RecQ4. Neither group detected helicase activity, although Macris et al. (22Macris M.A. Krejci L. Bussen W. Shimamoto A. Sung P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) did observe single strand annealing. Recently, Xu and Liu (23Xu X. Liu Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) observed that RecQ4 simultaneously unwinds and anneals DNA but found this activity to be derived mostly from the Sld2 domain rather than the helicase domain. Furthermore, these activities may be better described as DNA strand exchange. Robust helicase activity in the RecQ4 holoenzyme has yet to be established. In this work, we demonstrate that Drosophila RecQ4 is a 3′-5′ helicase. We also demonstrate single-stranded annealing and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities in RecQ4. We have generated and purified a helicase-dead mutant protein, which establishes that the DNA unwinding activity is a result of the RecQ4 helicase domain. In vivo, this mutation is unable to rescue viability for null mutant flies, proving that the helicase activity is important to RecQ4 biological activity. This work constitutes the first clear demonstration of helicase activity for RecQ4 from any species. RecQ4 was expressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Drosophila RecQ4 cDNA was cloned into the pFastbac 1 vector with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) 2The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseAMPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. tag (separated from the enzyme by a PreScission Protease recognition site) and a C-terminal tag consisting of 10 histidines (His10). A diagrammatic representation of the recombinant RecQ4 construct is shown in Fig. 1A. The RecQ4-K898N mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the pFastbac 1 recombinant vector using the Stratagene QuikChange Lightning system. glutathione S-transferase 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. From the pFastbac 1-RecQ4 vector, the Bac-to-Bac system was used to create baculovirus encoding the RecQ4 construct under control of the p10 promoter. Sf9 cells were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1. Virus-infected cells were grown for an additional 48 h, pelleted, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Pelleted cells were lysed by resuspension with a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA). NaCl was added to a final concentration of 350 mm, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min with stirring. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Soluble material was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) for 1 h, allowing the GST-tagged enzyme to bind. Glutathione resin was washed three times with buffers of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% Triton X-100 containing, successively: 350 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, and 150 mm NaCl. To remove the GST tag, the enzyme was incubated for 2 h with 40 units of PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) per 1 liter of culture. Cleaved enzyme was then passed over a Co2+ IMAC (Clontech) column and washed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% Triton X-100. The same buffer, with 400 mm imidazole added, was used for step elution. Peak fractions from the IMAC column, as determined by the Bradford assay, were combined and applied to a glycerol density gradient from 30 to 60%. Gradients were centrifuged for 20 h at 60,000 rpm in a rotor TV-865B and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. The gradient peak was determined by ATPase assay for wtRecQ4 (see below) or SDS-PAGE analysis for RecQ4-K898N. The purified enzyme was flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (sequences shown in supplemental Table 1A). Oligonucleotides were resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA) buffer and 5′-radiolabeled with 32P using γ-32P-labeled ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were annealed to nonlabeled conjugate strands at a ratio of at least 1:3 in 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 by a controlled temperature decrease in a thermocycler from 95 to 25 °C. Annealed substrates were separated on a polyacrylamide gel (8 or 15%) in TBE (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA). Substrates were extracted from excised gel fragments by electroelution with the S&S Elutrap system (Whatman). Purified substrates were stored at −20 °C in TBE with 5 mm MgCl2. For helicase assays, enzyme was incubated with 0.2 nm radiolabeled substrate for 30 min at 27 °C in 2.5 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 2.5 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP (or the indicated nucleotide cofactor) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 μl of stop mix to a final concentration of 0.2% SDS, 5% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 0.1 mg/ml xylene cyanol. Reaction products were separated on a 15% TBE-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Annealing assays were conducted as detailed for helicase assays, except that enzyme was incubated with 0.2 nm single-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotide and 0.2 nm nonlabeled complementary oligonucleotide. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide was purified as described previously. Complementary nonlabeled oligonucleotide was resuspended in TE buffer upon receipt from Integrated DNA Technologies. Radiolabeled and complementary nonlabeled oligonucleotides were heated separately for 5 min at 80 °C before being added to the reaction. Enzyme was incubated with 1 mm ATP (3.8 nm γ-32P-labeled ATP) for 60 min at 27 °C in 2.5 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 2.5 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml pBSK+ single-stranded circular DNA in a total volume of 20 μl. At the indicated time points of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min, 1 μl of the reaction was spotted on Polygram CEL 300 PEI thin layer chromatography plates (Macherey-Nagel) that had been prerun in distilled water. Plates were soaked in methanol for 5 min, dried, and developed in 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid to separate inorganic phosphate from ATP. Dried plates were subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted as described for helicase assays with the following modifications. After 30 min, 4 μl of nondenaturing loading mix was added to each reaction to a final concentration of 5% sucrose, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 0.1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and reactions were placed on ice. Reaction products were separated on an 8% Tris borate-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Double filter binding assays were done with DE81 paper and nitrocellulose according to Wong and Lohman (24Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) with binding buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 25 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Filters were prewashed with 500 μl of binding buffer drawn through at 30 kilopascals of vacuum. Reactions (50 μl) were carried out in binding buffer with 3.4 nm RecQ4, 0.25 nm radiolabeled DNA substrate (as indicated), 1 mm nucleotide cofactor (as indicated) and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 27 °C for 30 min. Each reaction was drawn through at 30 kilopascals of vacuum and then washed with 500 μl of binding buffer with 500 mm potassium acetate. Nitrocellulose and DE81 sheets were dried and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Genomic DNA transgene P[RecQ4-V5] was generated by replacing green fluorescent protein with the V5 epitope in P[RecQ4-GFP] (11Wu J. Capp C. Feng L. Hsieh T.S. Dev. Biol. 2008; 323: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which encodes a protein with an in-frame V5 fusion at the C terminus of RecQ4. The K898N point mutation transgene was generated by employing a method similar to that used in making the point mutant in the baculoviral expression vector. The DNA sequences of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing before microinjection, which was carried out with the published procedure (25Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). Genetic rescue of the null recq419 mutant with the transgenic RecQ4 lines was carried out in a manner similar to that described previously (11Wu J. Capp C. Feng L. Hsieh T.S. Dev. Biol. 2008; 323: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Drosophila RecQ4, with an N-terminal GST tag and a C-terminal His10 tag (GST-RecQ4-His10; see Fig. 1A), was expressed in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. The two tags allowed for a double affinity purification strategy (see flowchart in Fig. 1B). Soluble material was first incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, which were bound by the GST tag of GST-RecQ4-His10. The GST tag was removed from RecQ4 by PreScission Protease, resulting in RecQ4-His10. The enzyme was further purified and concentrated by Co2+ affinity chromatography. The final purification step was accomplished by ultracentrifugation across a 30–60% glycerol density gradient. Peak fractions (Fig. 1B) as determined by ATPase activity and SDS-PAGE analysis were more than 96% pure based on densitometric tracing. RecQ4 and RecQ4-K898N peak fractions from glycerol density gradients consistently co-sediment with lactate dehydrogenase (a tetramer of polypeptides, each 36,000 Mr, for a total of 144,000 Mr). This suggests that RecQ4 exists predominantly as a monomer in solution. Because sedimentation velocity experiments alone do not provide a rigorous measurement of molecular weight, future experimentation will be necessary to further address the oligomerization state of RecQ4 in solution. Previous studies have been unsuccessful in detecting any significant helicase activity from the human RecQ4 protein either purified by immunoprecipitation (16Yin J. Kwon Y.T. Varshavsky A. Wang W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli (22Macris M.A. Krejci L. Bussen W. Shimamoto A. Sung P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, using the same heterologous E. coli expression system, a limited DNA unwinding activity has been detected (23Xu X. Liu Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the reaction that we observed is more akin to DNA strand exchange than the helicase activity commonly found in other RecQ homologs. A double-stranded molecule with blunt ends was unwound only in the presence of an excessive amount of complementary single strand. These results were unexpected given that all other RecQ family members exhibit a robust helicase activity with a preference for 3′ single-stranded ends. Although the sequence of RecQ4 diverges significantly from the rest of the family, the helicase domain maintains all of the key helicase domain motifs. To investigate the helicase activity of the purified Drosophila RecQ4 protein, we incubated RecQ4 with a 3′ extension DNA substrate (see Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4, and B and supplemental Table 1B). Helicase activity was detected only in the presence of ATP, with no activity observed in the absence of nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ADP or a nonhydrolyzable homolog, AMPPNP. To ensure that the observed DNA unwinding was because of RecQ4 rather than a contaminating helicase, lysine 898 in the Walker A motif (GSGKS) was mutated to asparagine (K898N). This mutation is known to reduce ATPase activity greatly, thus preventing helicase activity (26Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of the mutant protein are identical to those of the wild type including ultracentrifugation through a glycerol density gradient, suggesting that the mutant is neither unfolded nor aggregated. As expected, RecQ4-K898N did not exhibit helicase activity under any conditions (Fig. 2B). This establishes that the helicase activity observed is intrinsic to purified wild type RecQ4 and not attributable to a co-purifying contaminant. To further characterize this helicase activity, we incubated RecQ4 with several substrates constructed from oligonucleotides (relative substrate preferences are summarized in Fig. 2D; substrate sequences and makeup are given in supplemental Table 1). RecQ4 does not unwind a completely duplex substrate (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10) but will unwind a fork substrate (lanes 7 and 8). This indicates that a single-stranded region is necessary for RecQ4 helicase activity. Helicases in general exhibit distinct directionality preferences and may unwind DNA moving either 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′. RecQ family members have been observed primarily acting in a 3′ to 5′ direction. To determine the directionality of RecQ4 helicase activity, a comparison was made between the 3′ and 5′ extension substrates (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–6). Significant helicase activity was detected on the substrate with a 3′ extension but not on the one with a 5′ extension. This indicates that a single-stranded region at the 3′-end of the double-stranded region is necessary for RecQ4 helicase activity and suggests the enzyme moves in a 3′ to 5′ direction. We also examined the activity of RecQ4 on several variations of the fork, which resemble key intermediates in replication and recombination. We first tested 3′ and 5′ flap substrates. These are similar to the fork substrate, except that the indicated arm is single-stranded and the other is double-stranded. RecQ4 does not demonstrate appreciable helicase activity on the 5′ flap substrate (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). The contrasting 3′ flap substrate is unwound almost to completion by RecQ4 (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6). Both single-stranded DNA and simple fork substrates were detected as products, indicating that RecQ4 unwinds the substrate in both directions available to it (down the center of the substrate and along the 5′ double-stranded branch). Interestingly, RecQ4 unwinds a duplex fork substrate (a fork with both the 3′ and 5′ branches double-stranded) (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 8). The presence of partial reaction products, including 3′ or 5′ flap substrates, a fork substrate, and 3′ or 5′ extension substrates, suggests that RecQ4 may enter at the three-way junction and unwind along any of the three duplex arms. Indeed, unwinding a three-junction substrate has been observed for other RecQ helicases such as RecQ5 (27Ozsoy A.Z. Ragonese H.M. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1554-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Wrn (28Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and RecQ1 (29Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Choudhary S. Faulkner J.K. Cui S. Andreoli L. Muzzolini L. Vindigni A. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28072-28084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data suggest that Drosophila RecQ4 has an efficient helicase activity with substrate specificity similar to that of other members in the RecQ family of proteins. A hallmark activity for any DNA helicase is DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis (30Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). To characterize the ATPase activity of RecQ4, we incubated RecQ4 with γ-32P ATP in the presence or absence of single-stranded circular DNA and monitored the liberation of phosphate using thin layer chromatography. The presence of DNA greatly stimulated the hydrolysis of ATP by RecQ4 (Fig. 3A). Plasmid DNA also stimulated RecQ4 ATPase activity (data not shown). In contrast, the K898N mutant showed no detectable amount of ATP hydrolysis above background (Fig. 3B). This confirms that the K898N mutation abolishes ATP binding/hydrolysis in RecQ4. The mechanism of action of DNA helicases may require recognition of different DNA secondary structures and differential enzyme-substrate complex formation depending on the state of the bound nucleotide cofactors. Thus we examined RecQ4 DNA binding as a function of the nucleotide cofactor. Wild type RecQ4 was incubated with the 3′ extension substrate in the absence of nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ADP or AMPPNP, and reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4A). Complex formation evidenced by electrophoretic mobility shift was observed in the presence of AMPPNP (Fig. 4A, lane 4) but not in the presence of ADP (lane 3) or in the absence of nucleotide cofactor (lane 2). The importance of ATP binding in promoting the stable complex formation was corroborated by experiments using RecQ4-K898N. The mutant, which is defective in both ATPase and helicase activities, did not cause a shift under any of these conditions (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–8). This demonstrates that a stable enzyme-substrate complex is formed only with bound nucleotide triphosphate. The 3′ extension substrate has both single-stranded and double-stranded regions. To determine whether the critical determinant for stable RecQ4 binding is single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, or the junction between the two, the enzyme was incubated with AMPPNP and single-stra"
https://openalex.org/W1987203155,"In photosynthetic organisms, ferredoxin:NADP(+) oxidoreductase (FNR) is known to provide NADPH for CO(2) assimilation, but it also utilizes NADPH to provide reduced ferredoxin. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 produces two FNR isoforms, a small one (FNR(S)) similar to the one found in plant plastids and a large one (FNR(L)) that is associated with the phycobilisome, a light-harvesting complex. Here we show that a mutant lacking FNR(L) exhibits a higher NADP(+)/NADPH ratio. We also purified to homogeneity a phycobilisome subcomplex comprising FNR(L,) named FNR(L)-PC. The enzymatic activities of FNR(L)-PC were compared with those of FNR(S). During NADPH oxidation, FNR(L)-PC exhibits a 30% decrease in the Michaelis constant K(m)((NADPH)), and a 70% increase in K(m)((ferredoxin)), which is in agreement with its predicted lower activity of ferredoxin reduction. During NADP(+) reduction, the FNR(L)-PC shows a 29/43% decrease in the rate of single electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin in the presence/absence of NADP(+). The increase in K(m)((ferredoxin)) and the rate decrease of single reduction are attributed to steric hindrance by the phycocyanin moiety of FNR(L)-PC. Both isoforms are capable of catalyzing the NADP(+) reduction under multiple turnover conditions. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that, under high ionic strength conditions, electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin is rate limiting during this process. The differences that we observe might not fully explain the in vivo properties of the Synechocystis mutants expressing only one of the isoforms. Therefore, we advocate that FNR localization and/or substrates availability are essential in vivo."

Moreover, it also resulted in endosomal β-amyloid precursor protein accumulation characterized by increased β-site cleavage. These findings suggest that dynein dysfunction may underlie age-dependent endocytic dysfunction via the up-regulation of Rab GTPases.

https://openalex.org/W1992111618,"In Escherichia coli, the gamma complex clamp loader loads the beta-sliding clamp onto DNA. The beta clamp tethers DNA polymerase III to DNA and enhances the efficiency of replication by increasing the processivity of DNA synthesis. In the presence of ATP, gamma complex binds beta and DNA to form a ternary complex. Binding to primed template DNA triggers gamma complex to hydrolyze ATP and release the clamp onto DNA. Here, we investigated the kinetics of forming a ternary complex by measuring rates of gamma complex binding beta and DNA. A fluorescence intensity-based beta binding assay was developed in which the fluorescence of pyrene covalently attached to beta increases when bound by gamma complex. Using this assay, an association rate constant of 2.3 x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1) for gamma complex binding beta was determined. The rate of beta binding was the same in experiments in which gamma complex was preincubated with ATP before adding beta or added directly to beta and ATP. In contrast, when gamma complex is preincubated with ATP, DNA binding is faster than when gamma complex is added to DNA and ATP at the same time. Slow DNA binding in the absence of ATP preincubation is the result of a rate-limiting ATP-induced conformational change. Our results strongly suggest that the ATP-induced conformational changes that promote beta binding and DNA binding differ. The slow ATP-induced conformational change that precedes DNA binding may provide a kinetic preference for gamma complex to bind beta before DNA during the clamp loading reaction cycle."

We report here that recombinant Antheraea polyphemus PBP1 (ApolPBP1) picks up hydrophobic molecule(s) endogenous to the Escherichia coli expression host that keeps the protein in the “open” (bound) conformation at high pH but switches to the “closed” (free) conformation at low pH. This finding has bearing on the solution structures of undelipidated lepidopteran moth PBPs determined thus far. Picking up a hydrophobic molecule from the host expression system could be a common feature for lipid-binding proteins.

Thus, current views on the pH-induced conformational switch of PBPs hold true only for the ligand-bound open conformation of the protein. Binding of various ligands to delipidated ApolPBP1 studied by solution NMR revealed that the protein in the closed conformation switches to the open conformation only at or above pH 6.0 with a protein to ligand stoichiometry of ∼1:1. Mutation of His70 and His95 to alanine drives the equilibrium toward the open conformation even at low pH for the ligand-bound protein by eliminating the histidine-dependent pH-induced conformational switch.

Chemoreception in insects is mediated via sensing of a variety of small, volatile organic compounds. Chemoreception plays a critical role not only in the regulation of the most fundamental chemosensory behaviors in insects but also for intraspecies communication. Pheromone is a chemical signal that triggers a natural behavioral response in another member within the same species. In lepidopteran insects, sex pheromones produced by females are detected by males of the same species with extreme sensitivity and selectivity.

High pH conformations of both “ligand-bound” and free forms of BmorPBP have also been determined by x-ray crystallography (12.Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 13.Lautenschlager C. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The conformation of BmorPBPB in solution at pH 6.5 (9.Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Güntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) consists of six helices that are arranged encasing a large hydrophobic cavity, with an unstructured C-terminal tail that extends out to the solvent. This conformation is otherwise called the “open” conformation because the C-terminal tail is out to the solvent leaving the hydrophobic pocket open. At a low pH of 4.5, BmorPBPB undergoes a conformational switch to BmorPBPA, resulting in the formation of a seventh C-terminal helix that occupies the ligand-binding cavity (8.Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbühl P. Güntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in the “closed” conformation of the protein. It was proposed that the ligand is ejected by the C-terminal helix near the membrane-bound receptor as the pH is reduced due to membrane potential (8.Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbühl P. Güntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). ApolPBP1 has about 67% sequence identity with BmorPBP and shares a similar topology at a high pH, showing the presence of six α-helices held together by three disulfide bonds forming a hydrophobic cavity that can house the pheromone (10.Mohanty S. Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, at low pH there are differences in the ApolPBP1 and BmorPBP conformations. Although BmorPBPA at pH 4.5 forms the closed conformation (8.Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbühl P. Güntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), ApolPBP1 is devoid of the C-terminal helix at pH 5.2 and exists in more than one conformation (11.Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. Byeon I.J. Mohanty S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These differences led to the suggestion of a different ligand release model at low pH for ApolPBP1 (11.Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. Byeon I.J. Mohanty S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a recent report (14.Damberger F.F. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the delipidated ApolPBP1 at pH 4.5 was shown to have the same closed conformation as that of BmorPBPA with the C-terminal dodecapeptide segment tucked into the binding cavity after forming the seventh α-helix. However, there was a significant difference in the ApolPBP1 sample preparation in this study (14.Damberger F.F. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which included a delipidation step to remove the endogenous hydrophobic molecule(s) picked up by the protein from the expression host (Escherichia coli).

The x-ray analysis of BmorPBP at pH 7.5 (13.Lautenschlager C. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is the first report of a delipidated (unliganded) protein structure followed by the more recent report on the delipidated (unliganded) ApolPBP1 solution NMR structure (14.Damberger F.F. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) at pH 4.5. Interestingly, similar to the structural differences between the undelipidated and delipidated ApolPBP1 at low pH (11.Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. Byeon I.J. Mohanty S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14.Damberger F.F. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the structures of the undelipidated and delipidated BmorPBPs at high pH were significantly different as far as the seventh C-terminal helix is concerned (9.Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Güntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13.Lautenschlager C. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the delipidated unliganded BmorPBP at pH 7.5 was in the closed conformation (13.Lautenschlager C. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the structure of the undelipidated BmorPBP at pH 6.5 was in the open conformation (9.Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Güntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All the above observations for both ApolPBP1 and BmorPBP contradicted each other, implying that the same protein at a low or high pH may or may not have the internalized C-terminal helix (9.Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Güntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11.Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. Byeon I.J.

To understand the mystery underlying the differences between structures of these undelipidated (9.Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Güntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K.

Commun. 2005; 335: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14.Damberger F.F. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) at different pH values, we carried out a thorough investigation to clarify the effect of delipidation, pH, and ligand on the conformation of ApolPBP1 as a representative member of the moth PBP family using high resolution solution NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. Moreover, the proposed ligand release model involving the pH-induced histidine-driven conformational switch at low pH (11.Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. Byeon I.J. Mohanty S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12.Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem.

Commun. 2008; 372: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was verified by the mutation of His70 and His95 to alanine in ApolPBP1. To gain insight into the role of pH and ligand on the conformational switch, a detailed biophysical characterization of the double mutant was carried out. Based on our observations, we report that recombinant ApolPBP1 is bound to the hydrophobic ligand endogenous to the E. coli host regardless of whether the protein is expressed in soluble form or in inclusion bodies. Therefore, ApolPBP1 is in the open conformation at high pH unless the hydrophobic ligand picked up from the bacterial host is removed by delipidation, which has bearing on the biochemical (4.Prestwich G.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6.Wojtasek H. Leal W.S. J. Biol.

Thus, this work provides evidence that the previously determined NMR structures of ApolPBP1 and BmorPBP (9.Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Güntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10.Mohanty S. Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 354: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were on proteins bound to hydrophobic molecule(s) endogenous to bacteria, contrary to the reports that these were the structures of unliganded proteins. Although bacterially expressed BmorPBP has been shown to contain a fatty acid molecule (16.Oldham N.J. Krieger J. Breer H. Svatos A. Chem. Senses. 2001; 26: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), currently delipidation of heterologously expressed recombinant insect PBPs is not a standard procedure. Moreover, the consequences of the endogenous ligand from the host system on the conformational behaviors of the protein were not known. Thus, our finding provides very interesting and new insight into the pH- and ligand-induced conformational switch of both undelipidated and delipidated ApolPBP1. Ligand binding studies monitored by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy revealed that although the delipidated ApolPBP1 is able to bind a number of hydrophobic compounds, binding of pheromone is preferred over its analogs. Furthermore, the wild type protein can bind ligands only at a pH above 6.0, whereas the ApolPBP1H70A/H95A double mutant is able to bind ligands even at a pH below 5.0, thus providing evidence for the low pH-induced conformational switch driven by protonated histidines. The ApolPBP1 gene, previously cloned into pHN1+ vector (4.Prestwich G.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCGCCAGAGATCATGAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCGGATCCCTAAACTTCAGCTAAGACCTC-3′ (restriction sites underlined) and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-21a vector. The orientation and sequence of the ApolPBP1 gene in the expression vector were confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. ApolPBP1H70A and ApolPBP1H70A/H95A mutant plasmids were constructed from the ApolPBP1-pET-21a vector by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene. Native as well as mutant plasmids were transformed into E. coli origami cells, and the expression was carried out as reported previously (10.Mohanty S. Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11.Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. Byeon I.J. Mohanty S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The isotope-labeled proteins were expressed in M9 minimal medium with [15N]ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MA). The expression and lysis of cells were followed as reported previously (10.Mohanty S. Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11.Zubkov S. Gronenborn A.M. Byeon I.J. Mohanty S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After centrifugation of the cell lysate, the recombinant proteins were purified by a combination of dialysis, anion exchanger DEAE-chromatography, and finally twice on size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column fitted to ÄKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the theoretical E280 = 14230 m−1 cm−1. The delipidation of native and mutant ApolPBP1 was performed according to Bette et al. (17.Bette S. Breer H. Krieger J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The protein was first concentrated to 500 μl using a Millipore ultrafiltration concentrator (capacity 15 ml, molecular weight cutoff of 5000), and 4.5 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer pH 4.5 (buffer A) was added. The procedure of concentration and the addition of buffer were repeated twice, and the final volume of the protein was adjusted to 2 ml with buffer A. The protein was then incubated overnight with LipidexTM-1000 equilibrated with buffer A, in a column shaking continuously. The temperature of incubation did not have any effect on the efficiency of delipidation as same results were obtained for the protein delipidated at 4 °C, 22 °C or 37 °C. The protein was eluted from Lipidex-1000 with buffer A. The eluted protein was concentrated to 2 ml, incubated again overnight with fresh Lipidex-1000, and eluted with buffer A. The eluted and delipidated ApolPBP1 was concentrated and purified again by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 column using 20 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3 as the mobile phase. To prepare NMR samples, the purest fractions were exchanged to 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 or pH 4.5, with 1 mm EDTA and 0.01% sodium azide, containing 5% D2O, and concentrated using the Millipore ultrafiltration concentrator as per the protocol mentioned above. The purity of the sample was assessed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. 1). Mass spectrometry was carried out at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Auburn University Mass Spectrometry Facility. The delipidated ApolPBP1 was analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry on a Q-Tof PremierTM (Waters) mass spectrometer. All NMR data were collected at 35 °C on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance 1H/13C/15N TCI cryoprobe at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Auburn University. NMR samples used for pH titrations consisted of 400 μl of 0.8–1.1 mm uniformly 15N-labeled ApolPBP1wt or ApolPBP1H70A/H95A in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 or pH 4.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, and 5% D2O (used as a lock solvent) in a Shigemi tube. Two-dimensional {1H,15N} heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were collected for undelipidated and delipidated ApolPBP1wt and ApolPBP1H70A/H95A double mutant samples at pH 4.5 and 6.5. The pH titration of delipidated ApolPBP1wt was carried out in the pH range of 4.5 to 6.5 while following the movement of resonance peaks in two-dimensional {1H,15N} HSQC spectra. The protein at pH 4.5 was titrated to pH 6.5 using 1 m NaOH. HSQC spectra were recorded at each titration point, and the movement of peaks was followed using the assignment published previously (14.Damberger F.F. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the pH titration of ligand-bound protein, the delipidated ApolPBP1wt and ApolPBP1H70A/H95A samples were first incubated with an excess of ligand (1:5 palmitic acid) prior to titration from pH 6.5 to 4.5. The two-dimensional {1H,15N} HSQC spectra were collected at each titration point. For ligand titration experiments, uniformly 15N-labeled delipidated ApolPBP1wt (310 μl of 220 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 5% D2O, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3) was titrated with increasing concentrations of various ligands (0–2.2 mm), and the corresponding two-dimensional {1H,15N} HSQC spectra were recorded. Titration studies were carried out using eight different ligands as follows: 6E,11Z-hexadecadienyl acetate (A. polyphemus pheromone); 6E,11Z-hexadecadienyl diazoacetate and 6E,11Z-hexadecadienyl alcohol (A. polyphemus pheromone analogs); fatty acids (palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and oleic acid); and hydrophobic fluorescent probes (1-aminoanthracene (AMA) and 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid). Control experiments involved titration of 15N-labeled delipidated ApolPBP1wt with the same volumes of deuterated methanol as used for ligand titrations. Ligand titration studies were also carried out for the 15N-labeled delipidated ApolPBP1H70A/H95A double mutant with palmitic acid at pH 4.5 and 6.5. All data were processed using NMRPipe (18.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11626) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (19.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a 55B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a right angle configuration using a quartz cuvette of 1-cm path length. Slit widths of 7.5 and 7.0 nm were used for excitation and emission, respectively, and each spectrum was an average of 15 scans recorded at a speed of 500 nm/min. All fluorescence measurements were carried out in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 or pH 4.5, in the presence of 0.3% methanol at 22 °C. Methanol at this concentration had the maximum effect on the AMA fluorescence. All experiments were repeated at least twice to confirm reproducibility. The binding of AMA to the undelipidated and delipidated ApolPBP1wt and ApolPBP1H70A/H95A at pH 6.5 and 4.5 was studied by monitoring the increase in the AMA fluorescence at 480 nm. To 2 ml of a 1 μm protein sample, small aliquots of 2 mm AMA solution in methanol were added to a final concentration of 0–20 μm. After incubation for 10 min, the fluorescence spectra were recorded at the excitation wavelength of 256 nm, and emission of 400–600 nm. Appropriate controls were used to correct the spectra. Binding constants were determined from the nonlinear regression of the data with an equation corresponding to a single binding site. The competitive displacement of AMA from the delipidated ApolPBP1wt by various ligands was studied by monitoring the decrease in AMA fluorescence with increasing ligand concentrations. 1 μm delipidated ApolPBP1wt was equilibrated overnight with 1 μm (5 μm for the titrations at pH 4.5) AMA at 4 °C in dark. AMA fluorescence was recorded with an excitation wavelength of 256 nm and the emission of 400–600 nm. Ligands were added as aliquots of 2 mm stock solutions. After each addition, the complex was incubated for 10 min before recording the spectrum. The fluorescence spectra of ligands added to 1 μm AMA solution in the absence of the protein served as controls. The decrease in the fluorescence intensity of AMA at the λmax (480 nm) was calculated as (FC − Fmin)/(F0 − Fmin), where F0 is the initial fluorescence intensity of AMA-ApolPBP1wt complex; FC is the corrected fluorescence intensity at a ligand concentration [C], and Fmin is the fluorescence intensity at the saturating concentration of the competitor. The data were fitted to a nonlinear regression of the plot of (FC − Fmin)/(F0 − Fmin) against [C] with the equation corresponding to a single binding site. From these graphs, the IC50 values were determined at the ligand concentrations where the AMA fluorescence was quenched to half of its maximal intensity. Kd values were calculated using Equation 1, Kd=[IC50]/(1+[AMA]/KAMA)(Eq. 1) where [AMA] is the free AMA concentration, and KAMA is the dissociation constant for AMA-ApolPBP1wt complex determined from the AMA fluorescence measurements (20.Campanacci V.

To compare the ligand binding affinities of different protein samples, AMA displacement assays were carried out for the undelipidated and delipidated forms of ApolPBP1wt and ApolPBP1H70A/H95A at pH 6.5 and 4.5, using a single ligand, the"
https://openalex.org/W2125312764,"Antibody affinity limits sensitivity of detection in many areas of biology and medicine. High affinity usually depends on achieving the optimal combination of the natural 20 amino acids in the antibody binding site. Here, we investigate the effect on recognition of protein targets of placing an unnatural electrophile adjacent to the target binding site. We positioned a weak electrophile, acrylamide, near the binding site between an affibody, a non-immunoglobulin binding scaffold, and its protein target. The proximity between cysteine, lysine, or histidine on the target protein drove covalent bond formation to the electrophile on the affibody. Covalent bonds did not form to a non-interacting point mutant of the target, and there was minimal cross-reactivity with serum, cell lysate, or when imaging at the cell surface. Electrophilic affibodies showed more stable protein imaging at the surface of mammalian cells, and the sensitivity of protein detection in an immunoassay improved by two orders of magnitude. Thus electrophilic affibodies combined good specificity with improved detection of protein targets."
https://openalex.org/W2002200457,"We have previously shown that the mitotic motor centrosome protein E (CENP-E) is capable of walking for more than 250 steps on its microtubule track without dissociating. We have examined the kinetics of this molecular motor to see if its enzymology explains this remarkable degree of processivity. We find that like the highly processive transport motor kinesin 1, the enzymatic cycle of CENP-E is characterized by rapid ATP binding, multiple enzymatic turnovers per diffusive encounter, and gating of nucleotide binding. These features endow CENP-E with a high duty cycle, a prerequisite for processivity. However, unlike kinesin 1, neck linker docking in CENP-E is slow, occurring at a rate closer to that for Eg5, a mitotic kinesin that takes only 5–10 steps per processive run. These results suggest that like kinesin 1, features outside of the catalytic domain of CENP-E may also play a role in regulating the processive behavior of this motor. We have previously shown that the mitotic motor centrosome protein E (CENP-E) is capable of walking for more than 250 steps on its microtubule track without dissociating. We have examined the kinetics of this molecular motor to see if its enzymology explains this remarkable degree of processivity. We find that like the highly processive transport motor kinesin 1, the enzymatic cycle of CENP-E is characterized by rapid ATP binding, multiple enzymatic turnovers per diffusive encounter, and gating of nucleotide binding. These features endow CENP-E with a high duty cycle, a prerequisite for processivity.

IntroductionThe mitotic kinesins are a group of microtubule-based molecular motors that help orchestrate the complex dynamics of chromosomal and spindle movements during the process of mitosis (1.Goshima G. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).

CENP-E is markedly up-regulated during the G2 and M phases of the cell cyle, and it appears to be necessary both for proper chromosomal congression to the metaphase plate and for binding of spindle microtubules to the kinetochore (2.Schaar B.T.

Furthermore, it had been proposed that CENP-E functions by actively transporting chromosomes along kinetochore fibers (5.Putkey F.R. Cramer T. Morphew M.K. Silk A.D. Johnson R.S. McIntosh J.R.

As such, it would therefore be expected to share features with another, better characterized processive kinesin, kinesin 1. Consistent with this, we had previously shown that a dimeric construct of CENP-E is capable of walking processively for over 250 steps on the microtubule in a hand over hand manner, with stall forces very similar to what had been previously measured for kinesin 1 (8.Yardimci H. van Duffelen M.

This connection between enzymology and processivity also applies to Eg5, a mitotic kinesin responsible for formation of a bipolar spindle. We had previously shown that neck linker docking for Eg5 gates ATP binding, and it is 20-fold slower than for kinesin 1, and these differences explain the much shorter run lengths for this processive mitotic motor (14.Rosenfeld S.S.

https://openalex.org/W2003260510,"Mutations in polycystin-1 (PC1) can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which is a leading cause of renal failure. The available evidence suggests that PC1 acts as a mechanosensor, receiving signals from the primary cilia, neighboring cells, and extracellular matrix. PC1 is a large membrane protein that has a long N-terminal extracellular region (about 3000 amino acids) with a multimodular structure including 16 Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains, which are targeted by many naturally occurring missense mutations. Nothing is known about the effects of these mutations on the biophysical properties of PKD domains. Here we investigate the effects of several naturally occurring mutations on the mechanical stability of the first PKD domain of human PC1 (HuPKDd1). We found that several missense mutations alter the mechanical unfolding pathways of HuPKDd1, resulting in distinct mechanical phenotypes. Moreover, we found that these mutations also alter the thermodynamic stability of a structurally homologous archaeal PKD domain. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that missense mutations may cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease by altering the stability of the PC1 ectodomain, thereby perturbing its ability to sense mechanical signals."

The molecular modeling study of the full-length Bfl-1 performed within this work suggests that Bfl-1 may co-exist in two distinct conformational states: one in which its C-terminal helix α9 is inserted in the hydrophobic groove formed by the BH1–3 domains of Bfl-1 and one with its C terminus. Parallel analysis of the subcellular localization of Bfl-1 indicates that even if Bfl-1 may co-exist in two distinct conformational states, most of the endogenous protein is tightly associated with the mitochondria by its C terminus in both healthy and apoptotic peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in malignant B cell lines. However, the helix α9 of Bfl-1, and therefore the binding of Bfl-1 to mitochondria, is not absolutely required for the antiapoptotic activity of Bfl-1. A particular feature of Bfl-1 is the amphipathic character of its C-terminal helix α9.

Our data clearly indicate that this property of helix α9 is required for the anchorage of Bfl-1 to the mitochondria but also regulates the antiapoptotic function Bfl-1. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that plays a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and a delicate balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulators of apoptosis pathways ensures the proper survival of cells in a variety of tissues. Imbalance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins occurs in diseases such as cancer, where an overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins endows cells with a selective survival advantage that promotes malignancy. Bcl-2 family members are essential regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which act at the level of mitochondria as initiators of cell death (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). This family comprises nearly 20 proteins divided into three main groups. Antiapoptotic members such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 promote cell survival, whereas proapoptotic members such as Bax and Bak function as death effectors. The life and death balance is displaced in favor of cell death by proapoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim, Bad, Bid, Puma, and Noxa, which interact with antiapoptotic proteins and inactivate their function (2Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) or directly interact with and activate the Bax-like proteins (3Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar).Distinct subcellular localizations of antiapoptotic members have been reported correlating with the accessibility of their C-terminal tail. The C-terminal tail of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w possess a hydrophobic region known to be a membrane anchor domain. Thus, Bcl-2 localizes to mitochondria as well as to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes (4Kaufmann T. Schlipf S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5Lithgow T. van Driel R. Bertram J.F. Strasser A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 411-417PubMed Google Scholar, 6Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar), and deletion of its C-terminal amino acids abrogates its targeting to the outer mitochondrial membrane (7Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in healthy cells, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w localize mainly in the cytosol because their C-terminal tails are sequestered. Bcl-xL exists as a homodimer through the exchange of the C-terminal tail bound in the hydrophobic groove of the reciprocal dimer partner (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal tail of Bcl-w occupies its own hydrophobic groove in the monomer form (9Denisov A.Y.

It has been proposed that, following apoptotic stimuli, interaction of the BH3 domain from BH3-only proteins with the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-w or Bcl-xL liberates their C-terminal tail and then the two proteins translocate to the mitochondria (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Wilson-Annan J. O'Reilly L.A. Crawford S.A. Hausmann G.

Biol. 2003; 162: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Unlike Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, Bfl-1 and its murine homolog, A1, do not contain a well defined C-terminal transmembrane domain (12D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Herold M.J. Zeitz J. Pelzer C. Kraus C. Peters A. Wohlleben G. Berberich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13663-13671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). C-terminal ends of these two proteins are similar and contain several hydrophilic residues that interrupt their putative transmembrane hydrophobic domain. Whether the C-terminal tail of Bfl-1 functions as a membrane anchor remains to be clarified. Immunofluorescence analyses in an earlier study have shown that overexpressed human Bfl-1 is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic/nuclear envelope regions (14D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3879-3882PubMed Google Scholar). Then, recent independent studies, with Bfl-1-overexpressing cells, suggested that Bfl-1 localizes to the mitochondria (15Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22781-22788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Kucharczak J.F. Simmons M.J. Duckett C.S. Gélinas C.

Kim C.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, localization of endogenous Bfl-1 has never been investigated. In this study, we present a molecular modeling study of full-length Bfl-1 (FL-Bfl-1), based on the crystal structure of a truncated form of Bfl-1 (residues 1–149) in complex with the BIM-BH3 peptide (Protein Data Bank code 2VM6). 4M.

Trésaugues, T. Kotenyova, A. Flores, and P. Nordlund, unpublished data. Our model suggests that Bfl-1 may co-exist in two distinct conformational states, the first one with its C-terminal helix α9 (residues 155–175) inserted in the hydrophobic groove formed by the BH1–3 domain of Bfl-1, and the second one with its C-terminal tail. Interestingly, helical wheel projection of the C-terminal helix of Bfl-1 highlights its amphipathic character, a feature of transmembrane helices or membrane anchors. These observations incited the reinvestigation of the subcellular localization of Bfl-1 in both malignant B cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). 5The abbreviations used are: PBLperipheral blood lymphocytesFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseFLfull-lengthaaamino acid(s). 5The abbreviations used are: PBLperipheral blood lymphocytesFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseFLfull-lengthaaamino acid(s). We demonstrate here that endogenous Bfl-1 is preferentially anchored to the mitochondria in malignant B cell lines but also in healthy PBLs. Moreover, we show that both the anchorage of Bfl-1 to the mitochondria and the anti-apoptotic function of the protein are dependent on the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal helix.DISCUSSIONStructural studies of Bcl-2 family members showing a remarkably similar fold despite an overall divergence in amino acid sequence and function (proapoptotic versus antiapoptotic), have provided important insights into their molecular reaction mechanisms. Molecular modeling of FL-Bfl-1 presented herein indicates that the C-terminal helix α9 may interact with the hydrophobic groove. Similar observations were previously made for the human prosurvival protein Bcl-w (9Denisov A.Y. Madiraju M.S. Chen G. Khadir A. Beauparlant P. Attardo G. Shore G.C. Gehring K. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and for the proapoptotic protein Bax (27Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In accordance with the Bcl-w structure, it has been reported that both endogenous and overexpressed Bcl-w were found in the cytosolic fraction of healthy cell lysates and become inserted into the mitochondrial fraction in response to various apoptotic stimuli (10Hinds M.G. Lackmann M. Skea G.L. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Day C.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Wilson-Annan J. O'Reilly L.A. Crawford S.A. Hausmann G. Beaumont J.G.

Biol. 2003; 162: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), following displacement of the C-terminal region by BH3-only proteins. For Bax, it has been demonstrated that its C terminus is not implicated in its mitochondrial localization but plays a role in the dimerization process (28Er E. Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24938-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).In the case of Bfl-1, our model indicates that helix α9 may adopt two distinct conformational states. One is with helix α9 located in the hydrophobic binding groove giving rise to a compact molecule and where it may play a regulatory role by limiting the access to the hydrophobic BH3-binding cleft. In a second model, the molecule is more extended, with helix α9 protruding from the globular core of the protein and therefore potentially involved in interactions with membranes. Interestingly, helical wheel projection of helix α9 brings to the fore its amphipathic character, a characteristic of transmembrane helices or membrane anchors. We demonstrated here that endogenous Bfl-1, in healthy and etoposide-treated PBLs but also in malignant B cell lines, is localized to the mitochondria. Reinforcing this observation, we showed that in cell-free assays, the majority of FL-Bfl-1 is associated with mitochondria and that this association resists an alkaline treatment, thereby indicating a strong insertion of Bfl-1 into the mitochondria. In contrast to FL-Bfl-1, Δα9-Bfl-1 does not associate with mitochondria, demonstrating that helix α9 is absolutely required for Bfl-1 targeting to the mitochondria. Furthermore, as opposed to what has been described for Bax (28Er E. Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24938-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Bcl-xL (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the C-terminal tails are not required for dimerization of Bfl-1 (data not shown).A particular feature of Bfl-1 is the amphipathic character of helix α9. Our results clearly indicate that this property is required for the localization of Bfl-1 to the mitochondria but also for the prosurvival activity of Bfl-1. This amphipathic character was suggested earlier by Ko et al. (25Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These authors showed that a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal residues of Bfl-1 (residues 147–175) localizes to the mitochondria and induces mitochondrial permeability transition and cell death, supporting previous reports suggesting that proteolysis or N-terminal deletion of Bfl-1 converts this molecule from an antiapoptotic into a proapoptotic protein (16Kucharczak J.F. Simmons M.J. Duckett C.S. Gélinas C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1225-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Kim H.J. Choi H.Y. Yeo D.J. Park S.O. Yang W.S. Kim Y.N.

Biochem. 2005; 94: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ko et al. (25Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested that the amphipathic nature of the peptide is essential for its proapoptotic function but not for its localization to the mitochondria. They rather proposed that lysine residues 147 and 151, located within the loop connecting helices α8 and α9, and lysine 172, located in helix α9 (Fig. 1), are critical for targeting of the Bfl-1 C-terminal to the mitochondria. As reported by Ko et al. (25Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the triple mutation (E159Q/K163L/E166Q) within helix α9 does not affect mitochondrial localization of Bfl-1. However, we expected this result, as our analysis indicated that these mutations did not affect the amphipathic character of the C-terminal tail of Bfl-1 (supplemental Fig. 1, a and b). Finally, when introduced in the full-length form of the protein, these mutations did not either affect the antiapoptotic function of Bfl-1 (supplemental Fig. 1c).These data suggest that even though Bfl-1 may co-exist in two distinct conformational states, most of the endogenous Bfl-1 seems to be tightly associated with the mitochondria via its C-terminal end and that the amphipathic nature of helix α9 is critical for that localization. Therefore, Bfl-1 behaves differently from Bcl-w (11Wilson-Annan J. O'Reilly L.A. Crawford S.A. Hausmann G. Beaumont J.G. Parma L.P. Chen L. Lackmann M. Lithgow T. Hinds M.G. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 162: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but also behaves differently from Bcl-xL (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and Mcl-1 (30Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) that partially exist in the cytosol and also attached to the mitochondria. Following apoptotic stimuli, cytosolic Bcl-w and Bcl-xL are translocated to the mitochondria, whereas Mcl-1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome.An interesting observation is that whereas both Δα9-Bfl-1 and mut-FL-Bfl-1 localize in the cytosol, they display different activities. In agreement with previous data, we observe that Δα9-Bfl-1 remains functional (16Kucharczak J.F. Simmons M.J. Duckett C.S. Gélinas C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1225-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but in contrast that mut-FL-Bfl-1 loses its antiapoptotic property. These findings suggest that mut-FL-Bfl-1 putatively adopts a conformation in which helix α9 is located in the hydrophobic binding groove and thereby limits the access. Indeed, when looking at the three-dimensional model of mut-FL-Bfl-1 (results not shown) it appears that the triple mutation I164N/L168E/L171E induces the loss of a few hydrophobic interactions between helix α9 and the groove. However, this loss is largely compensated by the formation of four additional hydrogen bonds located in the C-terminal half of helix α9 and implicating the following residues: Asn-164/Arg-88, Asn-164/Glu-78, Glu-168/Glu-78, and Glu-171/Lys-77. Moreover, due to subtle rearrangements of side chains neighboring the three mutated residues, new hydrophobic contacts could be formed in the N-terminal half of α9. All of these newly established interactions are in favor of helix α9 being more stabilized in the hydrophobic binding groove rather than in an open conformation of mut-FL-Bfl-1, which seems more unlikely. This model is reinforced by fluorescence polarization assays showing that BH3 peptides cannot bind to mut-FL-Bfl-1 or FL-Bfl-1 proteins, suggesting that the hydrophobic groove is not fully accessible in these constructs. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that plays a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and a delicate balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulators of apoptosis pathways ensures the proper survival of cells in a variety of tissues. Imbalance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins occurs in diseases such as cancer, where an overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins endows cells with a selective survival advantage that promotes malignancy. Bcl-2 family members are essential regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which act at the level of mitochondria as initiators of cell death (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). This family comprises nearly 20 proteins divided into three main groups. Antiapoptotic members such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 promote cell survival, whereas proapoptotic members such as Bax and Bak function as death effectors. The life and death balance is displaced in favor of cell death by proapoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim, Bad, Bid, Puma, and Noxa, which interact with antiapoptotic proteins and inactivate their function (2Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) or directly interact with and activate the Bax-like proteins (3Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Distinct subcellular localizations of antiapoptotic members have been reported correlating with the accessibility of their C-terminal tail. The C-terminal tail of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w possess a hydrophobic region known to be a membrane anchor domain. Thus, Bcl-2 localizes to mitochondria as well as to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes (4Kaufmann T. Schlipf S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5Lithgow T. van Driel R. Bertram J.F. Strasser A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 411-417PubMed Google Scholar, 6Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar), and deletion of its C-terminal amino acids abrogates its targeting to the outer mitochondrial membrane (7Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in healthy cells, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w localize mainly in the cytosol because their C-terminal tails are sequestered. Bcl-xL exists as a homodimer through the exchange of the C-terminal tail bound in the hydrophobic groove of the reciprocal dimer partner (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal tail of Bcl-w occupies its own hydrophobic groove in the monomer form (9Denisov A.Y. Madiraju M.S. Chen G. Khadir A. Beauparlant P. Attardo G. Shore G.C. Gehring K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21124-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Hinds M.G. Lackmann M. Skea G.L. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Day C.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that, following apoptotic stimuli, interaction of the BH3 domain from BH3-only proteins with the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-w or Bcl-xL liberates their C-terminal tail and then the two proteins translocate to the mitochondria (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Wilson-Annan J. O'Reilly L.A. Crawford S.A. Hausmann G.

Unlike Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, Bfl-1 and its murine homolog, A1, do not contain a well defined C-terminal transmembrane domain (12D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Herold M.J. Zeitz J. Pelzer C. Kraus C. Peters A. Wohlleben G. Berberich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13663-13671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). C-terminal ends of these two proteins are similar and contain several hydrophilic residues that interrupt their putative transmembrane hydrophobic domain. Whether the C-terminal tail of Bfl-1 functions as a membrane anchor remains to be clarified. Immunofluorescence analyses in an earlier study have shown that overexpressed human Bfl-1 is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic/nuclear envelope regions (14D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3879-3882PubMed Google Scholar). Then, recent independent studies, with Bfl-1-overexpressing cells, suggested that Bfl-1 localizes to the mitochondria (15Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22781-22788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Kucharczak J.F. Simmons M.J. Duckett C.S. Gélinas C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18099-18107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and that the C-terminal end of Bfl-1 is important for anchoring Bfl-1 to the mitochondria due to GFP-Bfl-1 being associated to the mitochondria, whereas GFP-Bfl-1, devoid of its C-terminal tail, also localizes in the cytosol (16Kucharczak J.F. Simmons M.J. Duckett C.S. Gélinas C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1225-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Kim H.J. Choi H.Y. Yeo D.J. Park S.O. Yang W.S. Kim Y.N. Kim C.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, localization of endogenous Bfl-1 has never been investigated. In this study, we present a molecular modeling study of full-length Bfl-1 (FL-Bfl-1), based on the crystal structure of a truncated form of Bfl-1 (residues 1–149) in complex with the BIM-BH3 peptide (Protein Data Bank code 2VM6). 4M.

Trésaugues, T. Kotenyova, A. Flores, and P. Nordlund, unpublished data. Our model suggests that Bfl-1 may co-exist in two distinct conformational states, the first one with its C-terminal helix α9 (residues 155–175) inserted in the hydrophobic groove formed by the BH1–3 domain of Bfl-1, and the second one with its C-terminal tail. Interestingly, helical wheel projection of the C-terminal helix of Bfl-1 highlights its amphipathic character, a feature of transmembrane helices or membrane anchors. These observations incited the reinvestigation of the subcellular localization of Bfl-1 in both malignant B cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). 5The abbreviations used are: PBLperipheral blood lymphocytesFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseFLfull-lengthaaamino acid(s). 5The abbreviations used are: PBLperipheral blood lymphocytesFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseFLfull-lengthaaamino acid(s). We demonstrate here that endogenous Bfl-1 is preferentially anchored to the mitochondria in malignant B cell lines but also in healthy PBLs. Moreover, we show that both the anchorage of Bfl-1 to the mitochondria and the anti-apoptotic function of the protein are dependent on the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal helix. peripheral blood lymphocytes fluorescence-activated cell sorter green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase full-length amino acid(s). peripheral blood lymphocytes fluorescence-activated cell sorter green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase full-length amino acid(s). DISCUSSIONStructural studies of Bcl-2 family members showing a remarkably similar fold despite an overall divergence in amino acid sequence and function (proapoptotic versus antiapoptotic), have provided important insights into their molecular reaction mechanisms. Molecular modeling of FL-Bfl-1 presented herein indicates that the C-terminal helix α9 may interact with the hydrophobic groove. Similar observations were previously made for the human prosurvival protein Bcl-w (9Denisov A.Y. Madiraju M.S. Chen G. Khadir A. Beauparlant P. Attardo G. Shore G.C. Gehring K. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In accordance with the Bcl-w structure, it has been reported that both endogenous and overexpressed Bcl-w were found in the cytosolic fraction of healthy cell lysates and become inserted into the mitochondrial fraction in response to various apoptotic stimuli (10Hinds M.G. Lackmann M. Skea G.L. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Day C.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Wilson-Annan J. O'Reilly L.A. Crawford S.A. Hausmann G. Beaumont J.G.

Biol. 2003; 162: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), following displacement of the C-terminal region by BH3-only proteins. For Bax, it has been demonstrated that its C terminus is not implicated in its mitochondrial localization but plays a role in the dimerization process (28Er E. Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24938-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).In the case of Bfl-1, our model indicates that helix α9 may adopt two distinct conformational states. One is with helix α9 located in the hydrophobic binding groove giving rise to a compact molecule and where it may play a regulatory role by limiting the access to the hydrophobic BH3-binding cleft. In a second model, the molecule is more extended, with helix α9 protruding from the globular core of the protein and therefore potentially involved in interactions with membranes. Interestingly, helical wheel projection of helix α9 brings to the fore its amphipathic character, a characteristic of transmembrane helices or membrane anchors. We demonstrated here that endogenous Bfl-1, in healthy and etoposide-treated PBLs but also in malignant B cell lines, is localized to the mitochondria. Reinforcing this observation, we showed that in cell-free assays, the majority of FL-Bfl-1 is associated with mitochondria and that this association resists an alkaline treatment, thereby indicating a strong insertion of Bfl-1 into the mitochondria. In contrast to FL-Bfl-1, Δα9-Bfl-1 does not associate with mitochondria, demonstrating that helix α9 is absolutely required for Bfl-1 targeting to the mitochondria. Furthermore, as opposed to what has been described for Bax (28Er E. Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24938-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Bcl-xL (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the C-terminal tails are not required for dimerization of Bfl-1 (data not shown).A particular feature of Bfl-1 is the amphipathic character of helix α9. Our results clearly indicate that this property is required for the localization of Bfl-1 to the mitochondria but also for the prosurvival activity of Bfl-1.

These authors showed that a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal residues of Bfl-1 (residues 147–175) localizes to the mitochondria and induces mitochondrial permeability transition and cell death, supporting previous reports suggesting that proteolysis or N-terminal deletion of Bfl-1 converts this molecule from an antiapoptotic into a proapoptotic protein (16Kucharczak J.F. Simmons M.J. Duckett C.S. Gélinas C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1225-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Kim H.J. Choi H.Y. Yeo D.J. Park S.O. Yang W.S. Kim Y.N. Kim C.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Yang W.S. Ko J.K. Park S.O. Choi H.Y. Kim Y.N. Kim C.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ko et al. (25Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested that the amphipathic nature of the peptide is essential for its proapoptotic function but not for its localization to the mitochondria. They rather proposed that lysine residues 147 and 151, located within the loop connecting helices α8 and α9, and lysine 172, located in helix α9 (Fig. 1), are critical for targeting of the Bfl-1 C-terminal to the mitochondria. As reported by Ko et al. (25Ko J.K. Choi K.H. Pan Z. Lin P. Weisleder N. Kim C.W. Ma J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the triple mutation (E159Q/K163L/E166Q) within helix α9 does not affect mitochondrial localization of Bfl-1. However, we expected this result, as our analysis indicated that these mutations did not affect the amphipathic character of the C-terminal tail of Bfl-1 (supplemental Fig. 1, a and b). Finally, when introduced in the full-length form of the protein, these mutations did not either affect the antiapoptotic function of Bfl-1 (supplemental Fig. 1c). These data suggest that even though Bfl-1 may co-exist in two distinct conformational states, most of the endogenous Bfl-1 seems to be tightly associated with the mitochondria via its C-terminal end and that the amphipathic nature of helix α9 is critical for that localization. Therefore, Bfl-1 behaves differently from Bcl-w (11Wilson-Annan J. O'Reilly L.A. Crawford S.A. Hausmann G. Beaumont J.G. Parma L.P. Chen L. Lackmann M. Lithgow T. Hinds M.G. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 162: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but also behaves differently from Bcl-xL (8Jeong S.Y. Gaume B. Lee Y.J. Hsu Y.T. Ryu S.W. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and Mcl-1 (30Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) that partially exist in the cytosol and also attached to the mitochondria. Following apoptotic stimuli, cytosolic Bcl-w and Bcl-xL are translocated to the mitochondria, whereas Mcl-1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. An interesting observation is that whereas both Δα9-Bfl-1 and mut-FL-Bfl-1 localize in the cytosol, they display different activities. In agreement with previous data, we observe that Δα9-Bfl-1 remains functional (16Kucharczak J.F. Simmons M.J. Duckett C.S. Gélinas C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1225-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but in contrast that mut-FL-Bfl-1 loses its antiapoptotic property. These findings suggest that mut-FL-Bfl-1 putatively adopts a conformation in which helix α9 is located in the hydrophobic binding groove and thereby limits the access. Indeed, when looking at the three-dimensional model of mut-FL-Bfl-1 (results not shown) it appears that the triple mutation I164N/L168E/L171E induces the loss of a few hydrophobic interactions between helix α9 and the groove. However, this loss is largely compensated by the formation of four additional hydrogen bonds located in the C-terminal half of helix α9 and implicating the following residues: Asn-164/Arg-88, Asn-164/Glu-78, Glu-168/Glu-78, and Glu-171/Lys-77. Moreover, due to subtle rearrangements of side chains neighboring the three mutated residues, new hydrophobic contacts could be formed in the N-terminal half of α9. All of these newly established interactions are in favor of helix α9 being more stabilized in the hydrophobic binding groove rather than in an open conformation of mut-FL-Bfl-1, which seems more unlikely. This model is reinforced by fluorescence polarization assays showing that BH3 peptides cannot bind to mut-FL-Bfl-1 or FL-Bfl-1 proteins, suggesting that the hydrophobic groove is not fully accessible in these constructs.

Although it is well established that recruitment of mitochondria in this context involves the cleavage of Bid to truncated Bid (tBid), the precise post-mitochondrial signaling responsible for executioner caspase activation is controversial. Here, we used distinct clones of type II Jurkat T-lymphocytes in which the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway had been inhibited to investigate the molecular requirements necessary for Fas-induced apoptosis. Cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL were protected from apoptosis induced by agonistic anti-Fas antibody. By comparison, Apaf-1-deficient Jurkat cells were sensitive to anti-Fas, exhibiting Bid cleavage, Bak activation, the release of cytochrome c and Smac, and activation of executioner caspase-3. Inhibiting downstream caspase activation with the pharmacological inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk or by expressing the BIR1/BIR2 domains of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) decreased all anti-Fas-induced apoptotic changes. Additionally, pretreatment of Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells with a Smac mimetic sensitized these cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. Combined, our findings strongly suggest that Fas-mediated activation of executioner caspases and induction of apoptosis do not depend on apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 activation in prototypical type II cells.

INTRODUCTIONApoptosis is an active form of cell death that is executed by a family of cysteine proteases that cleave intracellular substrates after aspartate residues (caspases). Because apoptosis is important for cell removal during development and tissue homeostasis, disruptions in the regulation of apoptosis can play a role in the onset of numerous pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmunity, and cancer (1.Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 699-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Apoptosis can occur through two distinct signaling pathways. One is the extrinsic (receptor-mediated) pathway in which binding of a death receptor (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 2The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorTRAILTNF-related apoptosis-inducing factor ligandMOMPmitochondrial outer membrane permeabilizationSmacsecond mitochondria-derived activator of caspaseApaf-1apoptotic protease-activating factor-1tBidtruncated BidΔψmitochondrial membrane potentialXIAPX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteinBIRbaculoviral IAP repeatPBSphosphate-buffered salinePSphosphatidylserineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePIpropidium iodideBMHbismaleimidohexaneDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideCyt ccytochrome cshRNAshort hairpin RNA. receptor-1, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor-1, TRAIL-R2, and Fas) by a cognate ligand (e.g. TNFα, TRAIL, and FasL) or an agonistic antibody (e.g. CH-11) causes the recruitment of adaptor proteins (e.g. TRADD and FADD) and initiator procaspase-8 molecules to the cytosolic side of the receptor to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (2.Kischkel F.C.

Within the DISC, procaspase-8 molecules are activated by dimerization and subsequently undergo autoprocessing (3.Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E.

In most cell types (type I), active caspase-8 activates the executioner caspase-3, which, in turn, is responsible for many of the morphological and biochemical manifestations of apoptosis. In other cell types (type II), the amount of caspase-8 that is activated within the DISC is low and insufficient to directly activate downstream executioner procaspases, including caspase-3 and -7 (5.Scaffidi C.

Instead, active caspase-8 in type II cells is known to cleave the cytosolic BH3-only protein Bid to truncated Bid (tBid) (6.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

In turn, tBid can activate a multidomain Bcl-2 family protein (i.e. Bax and Bak) that stimulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the release of intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol (9.Kim H.

In particular, some evidence obtained using prototypical type II Jurkat cells demonstrated that overexpression of XIAP could inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in wild-type cells, and knocking down XIAP expression could sensitize Bcl-xL-transfected cells to receptor-mediated cell killing (12.Wilkinson J.C. Cepero E. Boise L.H. Duckett C.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7003-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A different study using a reconstituted in vitro cell-free system showed that recombinant Smac was sufficient to activate caspase-3 activity by inhibiting XIAP (13.Sun X.M. Bratton S.B. Butterworth M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggested that Smac-dependent neutralization of XIAP-mediated caspase-3 inhibition might be the most important consequence of MOMP during Fas-mediated apoptosis in type II cells, neither study examined this possibility in an experimental system in which a component of the apoptosome was absent. Intriguingly, a more recent study reported that a caspase-9-deficient Jurkat clone was highly resistant to Fas-induced caspase activation, which, in contrast to the two earlier studies, implicated an essential role for cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome formation and the activation of caspase-9 during Fas-induced apoptosis (11.Samraj A.K.

Because each of the aforementioned studies was performed using Jurkat cells, we also used clones of this cell line in which the intrinsic pathway had been inhibited due to either stable overexpression of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, the stable depletion of Apaf-1, or the stable expression of the baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat 1 and 2 (BIR1/BIR2) domains of XIAP (17.Shawgo M.E.

The data provided direct evidence that apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 activation is not required for extrinsic apoptosis induced by anti-Fas (CH-11).

In turn, tBid can activate a multidomain Bcl-2 family protein (i.e. Bax and Bak) that stimulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the release of intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol (9.Kim H.

In particular, some evidence obtained using prototypical type II Jurkat cells demonstrated that overexpression of XIAP could inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in wild-type cells, and knocking down XIAP expression could sensitize Bcl-xL-transfected cells to receptor-mediated cell killing (12.Wilkinson J.C. Cepero E. Boise L.H. Duckett C.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7003-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A different study using a reconstituted in vitro cell-free system showed that recombinant Smac was sufficient to activate caspase-3 activity by inhibiting XIAP (13.Sun X.M. Bratton S.B. Butterworth M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggested that Smac-dependent neutralization of XIAP-mediated caspase-3 inhibition might be the most important consequence of MOMP during Fas-mediated apoptosis in type II cells, neither study examined this possibility in an experimental system in which a component of the apoptosome was absent. Intriguingly, a more recent study reported that a caspase-9-deficient Jurkat clone was highly resistant to Fas-induced caspase activation, which, in contrast to the two earlier studies, implicated an essential role for cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome formation and the activation of caspase-9 during Fas-induced apoptosis (11.Samraj A.K.

Chem. 2006; 281: 29652-29659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). tumor necrosis factor TNF-related apoptosis-inducing factor ligand mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 truncated Bid mitochondrial membrane potential X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein baculoviral IAP repeat phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylserine fluorescein isothiocyanate propidium iodide bismaleimidohexane dimethyl sulfoxide cytochrome c short hairpin RNA. Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the precise signaling requirements necessary for Fas-mediated apoptosis in prototypical type II cells. Because each of the aforementioned studies was performed using Jurkat cells, we also used clones of this cell line in which the intrinsic pathway had been inhibited due to either stable overexpression of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, the stable depletion of Apaf-1, or the stable expression of the baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat 1 and 2 (BIR1/BIR2) domains of XIAP (17.Shawgo M.E. Shelton S.N. Robertson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35532-35538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The data provided direct evidence that apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 activation is not required for extrinsic apoptosis induced by anti-Fas (CH-11). Instead, our findings suggested that the inhibition of XIAP was a better determinant of the susceptibility of type II cells to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2095415523,"Clamp loaders assemble sliding clamps onto 3' primed sites for DNA polymerases. Clamp loaders are thought to be specific for a 3' primed site, and unable to bind a 5' site. We demonstrate here that the Escherichia coli gamma complex clamp loader can load the beta clamp onto a 5' primed site, although with at least 20-fold reduced efficiency relative to loading at a 3' primed site. Preferential clamp loading at a 3' site does not appear to be due to DNA binding, as the clamp loader forms an avid complex with beta at a 5' site. Preferential loading at a 3' versus a 5' site occurs at the ATP hydrolysis step, needed to close the ring around DNA. We also address DNA structural features that are recognized for preferential loading at a 3' site. Although the single-stranded template strand extends in opposite directions from 3' and 5' primed sites, thus making it a favorite candidate for distinguishing between 3' and 5' sites, the single-strand polarity at a primed template junction does not determine 3' site selection for clamp loading. Instead, we find that clamp loader recognition of a 3' site lies in the duplex portion of the primed site, not the single-strand portion. We present evidence that the beta clamp facilitates its own loading specificity for a 3' primed site. Implications to eukaryotic clamp loader complexes are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2068903701,"Glycolate oxidase is a flavin-dependent, peroxisomal enzyme that oxidizes alpha-hydroxy acids to the corresponding alpha-keto acids, with reduction of oxygen to H(2)O(2). In plants, the enzyme participates in photorespiration. In humans, it is a potential drug target for treatment of primary hyperoxaluria, a genetic disorder where overproduction of oxalate results in the formation of kidney stones. In this study, steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic approaches have been used to determine how pH affects the kinetic steps of the catalytic mechanism of human glycolate oxidase. The enzyme showed a Ping-Pong Bi-Bi kinetic mechanism between pH 6.0 and 10.0. Both the overall turnover of the enzyme (k(cat)) and the rate constant for anaerobic substrate reduction of the flavin were pH-independent at pH values above 7.0 and decreased slightly at lower pH, suggesting the involvement of an unprotonated group acting as a base in the chemical step of glycolate oxidation. The second-order rate constant for capture of glycolate (k(cat)/K(glycolate)) and the K(d)((app)) for the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex suggested the presence of a protonated group with apparent pK(a) of 8.5 participating in substrate binding. The k(cat)/K(oxygen) values were an order of magnitude faster when a group with pK(a) of 6.8 was unprotonated. These results are discussed in the context of the available three-dimensional structure of GOX."
https://openalex.org/W2052328968,"Retinal photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is unique among the phosphodiesterase enzyme family not only for its catalytic heterodimer but also for its regulatory gamma-subunits (Pgamma) whose inhibitory action is released upon binding to the G-protein transducin. It is generally assumed that during visual excitation both catalytic sites are relieved of Pgamma inhibition upon binding of two activated transducin molecules. Because PDE6 shares structural and pharmacological similarities with PDE5, we utilized radiolabeled PDE5 inhibitors to probe the catalytic sites of PDE6. The membrane filtration assay we used to quantify [(3)H]vardenafil binding to PDE6 required histone II-AS to stabilize drug binding to the active site. Under these conditions, [(3)H]vardenafil binds stoichiometrically to both the alpha- and beta-subunits of the activated PDE6 heterodimer. [(3)H]vardenafil fails to bind to either the PDE6 holoenzyme or the PDE6 catalytic dimer reconstituted with Pgamma, consistent with Pgamma blocking access to the drug-binding sites. Following transducin activation of membrane-associated PDE6 holoenzyme, [(3)H]vardenafil binding increases in proportion to the extent of PDE6 activation. Both [(3)H]vardenafil binding and hydrolytic activity of transducin-activated PDE6 fail to exceed 50% of the value for the PDE6 catalytic dimer. However, adding a 1000-fold excess of activated transducin can stimulate the hydrolytic activity of PDE6 to its maximum extent. These results demonstrate that both subunits of the PDE6 heterodimer are able to bind ligands to the enzyme active site. Furthermore, transducin relieves Pgamma inhibition of PDE6 in a biphasic manner, with only one-half of the maximum PDE6 activity efficiently attained during visual excitation."
https://openalex.org/W1997272092,"The helicases XPB and XPD are part of the TFIIH complex, which mediates transcription initiation as well as eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair (NER). Although there is no TFIIH complex present in archaea, most species contain both XPB and XPD and serve as a model for their eukaryotic homologs. Recently, a novel binding partner for XPB, Bax1 (binds archeal XPB), was identified in archaea. To gain insights into its role in NER, Bax1 from Thermoplasma acidophilum was characterized. We identified Bax1 as a novel Mg(2+)-dependent structure-specific endonuclease recognizing DNA containing a 3' overhang. Incision assays conducted with DNA substrates providing different lengths of the 3' overhang indicate that Bax1 specifically incises DNA in the single-stranded region of the 3' overhang 4-6 nucleotides to the single-stranded DNA/double-stranded DNA junction and thus is a structure-specific and not a sequence-specific endonuclease. In contrast, no incision was detected in the presence of a 5' overhang, double-stranded DNA, or DNA containing few unpaired nucleotides forming a bubble. Several Bax1 variants were generated based on multiple sequence alignments and examined with respect to their ability to perform the incision reaction. Residues Glu-124, Asp-132, Tyr-152, and Glu-155 show a dramatic reduction in incision activity, indicating a pivotal role in catalysis. Interestingly, Bax1 does not exhibit any incision activity in the presence of XPB, thus suggesting a role in NER in which the endonuclease activity is tightly regulated until the damage has been recognized and verified prior to the incision event."
