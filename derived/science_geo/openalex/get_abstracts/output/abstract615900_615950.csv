https://openalex.org/W2886680918,"Hierarchy provides a unifying principle for the macroscale organization of anatomical and functional properties across primate cortex, yet microscale bases of specialization across human cortex are poorly understood. Anatomical hierarchy is conventionally informed by invasive tract-tracing measurements, creating a need for a principled proxy measure in humans. Moreover, cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in gene expression, yet organizing principles of cortical transcription remain unclear. We hypothesized that specialization of cortical microcircuitry involves hierarchical gradients of gene expression. We found that a noninvasive neuroimaging measure-MRI-derived T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) mapping-reliably indexes anatomical hierarchy, and it captures the dominant pattern of transcriptional variation across human cortex. We found hierarchical gradients in expression profiles of genes related to microcircuit function, consistent with monkey microanatomy, and implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings identify a hierarchical axis linking cortical transcription and anatomy, along which gradients of microscale properties may contribute to the macroscale specialization of cortical function."
https://openalex.org/W2886489703,"The ATP-gated receptor P2X7 is expressed in multiple malignant tumours including neuroblastoma, melanoma, prostate, lung and breast. P2X7 has a significant role in mediating diverse cell responses, which upon dysregulation are associated with tumour initiation and development. The rapid, ATP-mediated activation of P2X7 induces a fast-inward cation current in cells. However, prolonged ATP-mediated activation of P2X7 leads to formation of a pore that increases membrane permeability and eventually causes cell death. This presents a potential paradox, as the tumour microenvironment contains extracellular ATP at levels sufficient to activate the P2X7 pore and trigger cell death. However, P2X7 expression is associated with enhanced cancer cell survival, proliferation and metastatic potential. At least one distinct conformational form of P2X7, termed non-pore functional P2X7 (nfP2X7), has been described, which is not able to form a functional pore. We demonstrate for the first time in this study that exposure to a high ATP concentration, equivalent to those measured in the tumour microenvironment, drives nfP2X7 expression and also that nfP2X7 is essential for tumour cell survival. We show that monoclonal antibodies raised against a P2X7 amino acid sequence (200-216), whose conformation is distinct from that of wild-type (WT) P2X7, bind specifically to nfP2X7 expressed on the surface of tumour cells. We also show that nfP2X7 is broadly expressed in patient-derived tumour sections from a wide range of cancers. Therefore, antibodies raised against E200 provide tools that can differentiate between forms of the P2X7 receptor that have a key role in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2886684443,"Mutations in the KRAS proto-oncogene are present in 50% of all colorectal cancers and are increasingly associated with chemotherapeutic resistance to frontline biologic drugs. Accumulating evidence indicates key roles for overactive KRAS mutations in the metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Here, we sought to exploit the more negative membrane potential of cancer cell mitochondria as an untapped avenue for interfering with energy metabolism in KRAS variant–containing and KRAS WT colorectal cancer cells. Mitochondrial function, intracellular ATP levels, cellular uptake, energy sensor signaling, and functional effects on cancer cell proliferation were assayed. 3-Carboxyl proxyl nitroxide (Mito-CP) and Mito-Metformin, two mitochondria-targeted compounds, depleted intracellular ATP levels and persistently inhibited ATP-linked oxygen consumption in both KRAS WT and KRAS variant–containing colon cancer cells and had only limited effects on nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells. These anti-proliferative effects reflected the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the phosphorylation-mediated suppression of the mTOR target ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (RPS6KB1 or p70S6K). Moreover, Mito-CP and Mito-Metformin released Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) from mTOR-mediated inhibition, affected mitochondrial morphology, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, all indicators of mitophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of the AMPK signaling cascade mitigated the anti-proliferative effects of Mito-CP and Mito-Metformin. This is the first demonstration that drugs selectively targeting mitochondria induce mitophagy in cancer cells. Targeting bioenergetic metabolism with mitochondria-targeted drugs to stimulate mitophagy provides an attractive approach for therapeutic intervention in KRAS WT and overactive mutant-expressing colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2887353257,"Food Security is a long-standing concern worldwide. The expansion of global food markets brings benefits but also risks, such as shock transmission within the global network of trade relations. We focus on this last issue, from an empirical point of view, by analysing the diffusion of trade shocks—defined as relevant drops in exported quantities—during the period 1986—2011, for four major staples (wheat, maize, rice, and soy-beans) both at country level and at global scale. We find that: (i) income per capita of importing countries is relevant in shock propagation; (ii) developing countries tend to absorb most of the negative export variation (i.e., the trade shock), and (iii) global food prices and real (tonnes) flows of commodities are only weakly correlated, meaning that a quantity-based investigation provides additional information with respect to a price-based analysis. This work offers a novel framework, complementary to the price-based literature, for the measurement of the propagation of international food shocks."
https://openalex.org/W2885291208,"The mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain are poorly understood. Here we show the unexplored role of the hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor type 2 (HCAR2) in 2 models of neuropathic pain. We used an oral treatment with dimethyl fumarate and the HCAR2 endogenous ligand β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in wild-type (WT) and HCAR2-null mice. We found an up-regulation of the HCAR2 in the sciatic nerve and the dorsal root ganglia in neuropathic mice. Accordingly, acute and chronic treatment with dimethylfumarate (DMF) and BHB reduced the tactile allodynia. This effect was completely lost in the HCAR2-null mice after a 2-d starvation protocol, in which the BHB reached the concentration able to activate the HCAR2-reduced tactile allodynia in female WT mice, but not in the HCAR2-null mice. Finally, we showed that chronic treatment with DMF reduced the firing of the ON cells (cells responding with an excitation after noxious stimulation) of the rostral ventromedial medulla. Our results pave the way for investigating the mechanisms by which HCAR2 regulates neuropathic pain plasticity.—Boccella, S., Guida, F., De Logu, F., De Gregorio, D., Mazzitelli, M., Belardo, C., Iannotta, M., Serra, N., Nassini, R., deNovellis, V., Geppetti, P., Maione, S., Luongo, L.

https://openalex.org/W2885483780,"Analogous to the c-Myc (Myc)/Max family of bHLH-ZIP transcription factors, there exists a parallel regulatory network of structurally and functionally related proteins with Myc-like functions. Two related Myc-like paralogs, termed MondoA and MondoB/carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), up-regulate gene expression in heterodimeric association with the bHLH-ZIP Max-like factor Mlx. Myc is necessary to support liver cancer growth, but not for normal hepatocyte proliferation. Here, we investigated ChREBP's role in these processes and its relationship to Myc. Unlike Myc loss, ChREBP loss conferred a proliferative disadvantage to normal murine hepatocytes, as did the combined loss of ChREBP and Myc. Moreover, hepatoblastomas (HBs) originating in myc-/-, chrebp-/-, or myc-/-/chrebp-/- backgrounds grew significantly more slowly. Metabolic studies on livers and HBs in all three genetic backgrounds revealed marked differences in oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. RNA-Seq of livers and HBs suggested seven distinct mechanisms of Myc-ChREBP target gene regulation. Gene ontology analysis indicated that many transcripts deregulated in the chrebp-/- background encode enzymes functioning in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and β- and ω-FAO, whereas those dysregulated in the myc-/- background encode enzymes functioning in glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and sterol biosynthesis. In the myc-/-/chrebp-/- background, additional deregulated transcripts included those involved in peroxisomal β- and α-FAO. Finally, we observed that Myc and ChREBP cooperatively up-regulated virtually all ribosomal protein genes. Our findings define the individual and cooperative proliferative, metabolic, and transcriptional roles for the Extended Myc Network under both normal and neoplastic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2887639306,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major complication of diabetes, and there is a critical need to develop novel cell- and tissue-based therapies to treat these chronic wounds. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a replenishing source of allogeneic and autologous cell types that may be beneficial to improve DFU wound-healing outcomes. However, the biologic potential of iPSC-derived cells to treat DFUs has not, to our knowledge, been investigated. Toward that goal, we have performed detailed characterization of iPSC-derived fibroblasts from both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Significantly, gene array and functional analyses reveal that iPSC-derived fibroblasts from both patients with and those without diabetes are more similar to each other than were the primary cells from which they were derived. iPSC-derived fibroblasts showed improved migratory properties in 2-dimensional culture. iPSC-derived fibroblasts from DFUs displayed a unique biochemical composition and morphology when grown as 3-dimensional (3D), self-assembled extracellular matrix tissues, which were distinct from tissues fabricated using the parental DFU fibroblasts from which they were reprogrammed. In vivo transplantation of 3D tissues with iPSC-derived fibroblasts showed they persisted in the wound and facilitated diabetic wound closure compared with primary DFU fibroblasts. Taken together, our findings support the potential application of these iPSC-derived fibroblasts and 3D tissues to improve wound healing.-Kashpur, O., Smith, A., Gerami-Naini, B., Maione, A.

https://openalex.org/W2886017791,"In hemodialysis patients, high levels of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) predict mortality. Our study was designed to test whether the control of serum phosphate is associated with a reduction in serum FGF23 levels. Additionally other variables with a potential effect on FGF23 levels were evaluated.The effect of sustained (40-weeks) control of serum phosphate on FGF23 levels (intact and c-terminal) was evaluated in 21 stable hemodialysis patients that were not receiving calcimimetics or active vitamin D. Patients received non-calcium phosphate binders to maintain serum phosphate below 4.5 mg/dl. In an additional analysis, values of intact-FGF23 (iFGF23) and c-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) from 150 hemodialysis patients were correlated with parameters of mineral metabolism and inflammation. Linear mixed models and linear regression were performed to evaluate longitudinal trajectories of variables and the association between FGF23 and the other variables examined.During the 40-week treatment, 12 of 21 patients achieved the target of serum phosphate <4.5 mg/dl. In these 12 patients, iFGF23 decreased to less than half whereas cFGF23 did not reduce significantly. In patients with serum phosphate >4.5 mg, iFGF23 and cFGF23 increased two and four-fold respectively as compared with baseline. Furthermore, changes in serum phosphate correlated with changes in C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In our 150 hemodialysis patients, those in the higher tertile of serum phosphate also showed increased hs-CRP, iPTH, iFGF23 and cFGF23. Multiple regression analysis revealed that iFGF23 levels directly correlated with both serum phosphate and calcium, whereas cFGF23 correlated with serum phosphate and hs-CRP but not with calcium.The control of serum phosphate reduced iFGF23. This reduction was also associated with a decreased in inflammatory parameters. Considering the entire cohort of hemodialysis patients, iFGF23 levels correlated directly with serum phosphate levels and also correlated inversely with serum calcium concentration. The levels of cFGF23 were closely related to serum phosphate and parameters of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2885725560,"Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by repetitive thinking and high rates of depression. Understanding the extent to which repetitive negative thinking in ASD reflects autistic stereotypy versus general depressive thinking patterns (e.g., rumination) could help guide treatment research to improve emotional health in ASD. We compared associations between rumination, depressive symptoms, and pupil response to social-emotional material in adults with ASD and typically developing (TD) adults with and without depression. Methods N = 53 verbally fluent young adults were recruited to three cohorts: ASD, n = 21; TD-depressed, n = 13; never-depressed TD-controls, n = 19. Participants completed Ruminative Response Scale and Beck Depression Inventory self-reports and a passive-viewing task employing emotionally-expressive faces, during which pupillary motility was assessed to quantify cognitive-affective load. Main and interactive effects of cohort, emotion condition, and time on pupil amplitude were tested via a linear mixed effects analysis of variance using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Similar procedures were used to test for effects of rumination and depressive symptoms on pupil amplitude over time within ASD. Results Responsive pupil dilation in the ASD cohort tended to be significantly lower than TD-depressed initially but increased to comparable levels by trial end. When viewing sad faces, individuals with ASD who had higher depression scores resembled TD-depressed participants’ faster, larger, and sustained pupil response. Within ASD, depressive symptoms uniquely predicted early pupil response to sad faces, while rumination and depression scores each independently predicted sustained pupil response. Conclusions People with elevated depressive symptoms appear to have faster and greater increases in pupil-indexed neural activation following sad stimuli, regardless of ASD status, suggesting the utility of conceptualizing rumination as depression-like in treatment. Ruminative processes may increase more slowly in ASD, suggesting the potential utility of interventions that decrease reactions before they are uncontrollable. Findings also reinforce the importance of testing for effects of internalizing variables in broader ASD research."
https://openalex.org/W2887091260,"Chicken as a food source is one of the most widespread domestic animals, and it has been used extensively as a research model. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is the most efficient and reliable tool for precise genome-targeted modification and has generated considerable excitement for industrial applications, as well as biologic science. Unlike in mammals, germline-transmittable primordial germ cells (PGCs) in chicken were used as an alternative strategy for the production of genetically altered chickens. Here, by combining the CRISPR-Cas9 platform and germ cell-mediated germline transmission, we generated G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2)knockout (KO)chickens, and G0S2 null KO chickens showed a dramatic reduction of abdominal fat deposition without affecting other economic traits. Additionally, G0S2 null KO chickens had altered fatty acid compositions in their blood and abdominal fat compared with wild-type chickens under normal dietary conditions. The global mRNA sequencing data showed that G0S2 disruption in chickens would activate the adipose tissue-specific peroxisomal oxidation pathway, and enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA), hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase might be a target molecule in metabolic homeostasis in the chicken adipose tissue. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system with chicken PGCs can facilitate the production of specific genome-edited chickens for practical applications, as well as basic research.—Park, T.

https://openalex.org/W2887162114,"Cellular plasticity is a key facet of cellular homeostasis requiring correct temporal and spatial patterns of alternative splicing. Splicing factors, which orchestrate this process, demonstrate age-related dysregulation of expression; they are emerging as potential influences on aging and longevity. The upstream drivers of these alterations are still unclear but may involve aberrant cellular signaling. We compared the phosphorylation status of proteins in multiple signaling pathways in early and late passage human primary fibroblasts. We then assessed the impact of chemical inhibition or targeted knockdown of direct downstream targets of the ERK and AKT pathways on splicing factor expression, cellular senescence, and proliferation kinetics in senescent primary human fibroblasts. Components of the ERK and AKT signaling pathways demonstrated altered activation during cellular aging. Inhibition of AKT and ERK pathways led to up-regulation of splicing factor expression, reduction in senescent cell load, and partial reversal of multiple cellular senescence phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of the genes encoding the downstream targets FOXO1 or ETV6 was sufficient to mimic these observations. Our results suggest that age-associated dysregulation of splicing factor expression and cellular senescence may derive in part from altered activity of ERK and AKT signaling and may act in part through the ETV6 and FOXO1 transcription factors. Targeting the activity of downstream effectors of ERK and AKT may therefore represent promising targets for future therapeutic intervention.—Latorre, E., Ostler, E. L., Faragher, R. G.

https://openalex.org/W2887361704,"Purpose To evaluate microvasculature dropout in the optic disc (Mvd-D) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and investigate factors associated with Mvd-D in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) eyes. Methods One hundred twenty-three eyes of 123 POAG patients were included from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study. The 3.0×3.0-mm optic nerve head OCTA scans were acquired using a spectral-domain OCT instrument. Images with whole-signal-mode were evaluated. Eyes were classified into 3 categories (Mvd-D, pseudo-Mvd-D, and no Mvd-D). Mvd-D and pseudo-Mvd-D had complete loss of OCTA signals on the temporal side of the optic disc on the en face projection image. They were distinguished base on the visualization of the anterior lamina cribrosa in the horizontal B-scans of that area. No Mvd-D was defined when no complete signal loss of OCTA signals was observed. Covariates including focal lamina cribrosa defects assessed by swept-source OCT and microvasculature dropout in the parapapillary region (Mvd-P) were analyzed. Results Forty-two, 37, and 44 eyes were identified as having Mvd-D, pseudo-Mvd-D, and no Mvd-D, respectively. The eyes with Mvd-D showed significantly lower intraocular pressure, worse visual field mean deviation, larger cup-to-disc ratio, thinner circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL), and lower circumpapillary vessel density within the RNFL than the eyes with pseudo-Mvd-D or the eyes without Mvd-D. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed significant associations of Mvd-D with larger cup-to-disc ratio (OR, 1.08; P = 0.001), worse visual field mean deviation (OR, 1.09; P = 0.048), higher prevalence of focal lamina cribrosa defect (OR, 9.05; P = 0.002), and higher prevalence of Mvd-P (OR, 10.33; P <0.001). Conclusions OCTA-derived Mvd-D was strongly associated with the presences of Mvd-P and focal lamina cribrosa defects, and these 3 findings were topographically associated with each other."
https://openalex.org/W2885967980,"Insulation by myelin lipids is essential to fast action potential conductivity: changes in their quality or amount can cause several neurologic disorders. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is one such disorder, which is caused by mutations in the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2. To date, the molecular mechanism underlying SLS pathology has remained unknown. In this study, we found that Aldh3a2 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and neurons in the mouse brain, and neurons of Aldh3a2 knockout (KO) mice exhibited impaired metabolism of the long-chain base, a component of sphingolipids. Aldh3a2 KO mice showed several abnormalities corresponding to SLS symptoms in behavioral tests, including increased paw slips on a balance beam and light-induced anxiety. In their brain tissue, 2-hydroxygalactosylceramide, an important lipid for myelin function and maintenance, was reduced by the inactivation of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. Our findings provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for neural pathogenesis caused by lipid metabolism abnormalities.—Kanetake, T., Sassa, T., Nojiri, K., Sawai, M., Hattori, S., Miyakawa, T., Kitamura, T., Kihara, A.

Genetic and genomic research into various onion accessions will provide insights into the onion genome to enhance breeding strategies and improve crops. However, the onion’s large genome size means that studies of molecular markers are limited in onion. This study aimed to discover high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 192 onion inbred lines relating to short-day cultivation in Korea. Paired-end (PE) double digested restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) was used to discover SNPs in onion. A total of 538,973,706 reads (25.9 GB), with an average of 2,658,491 high-quality reads, were generated using ddRAD-seq. With stringent filtering, 1904 SNPs were discovered based on onion reference scaffolds. Further, population structure and genetic relationship studies suggested that two well-differentiated sub-populations exist in onion lines. SNP-associated flanking sequences were also compared with a public non-redundant database for gene ontology and pathway analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify high-quality SNPs in onion based on reference sequences using the ddRAD-seq platform. The SNP markers identified will be useful for breeders and the research community to deepen their understanding, enhance breeding programs, and support the management of onion genomic resources."
https://openalex.org/W2887785442,"The pathogenesis of delirium in critically ill patients is multifactorial. How hypotension and hypoxemia affect brain function and whether they can promote delirium remains unclear. A high cumulative positive fluid balance may also have a negative effect on brain function and promote delirium. We hypothesized that delirium would be more likely to develop in patients with low systemic arterial pressure, hypoxemia and a higher positive fluid balance, and investigated these associations in a prospective observational cohort study in patients with shock. After initial resuscitation, episodes of hypotension, defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg or diastolic pressure <60 mmHg, and hypoxemia, defined as peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) <90% for more than one minute or any arterial oxygen concentration (PaO2) <90 mmHg, were recorded during the first 5 days of the ICU stay. Fluid balance was evaluated daily and the 5-day cumulative fluid balance recorded. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. A total of 252 patients were admitted with shock during the study period; 185 (73%) developed delirium. Patients who developed delirium also had more episodes of hypotension with a low MAP (p = 0.013) or diastolic pressure (p = 0.018) during the first five days of the ICU stay than those who did not. Patients with a higher cumulative fluid balance during the same period were also more likely to develop delirium (p = 0.01); there was no significant difference in the occurrence of hypoxemia between groups. Joint modeling, combining a linear-mixed model and an adjusted Cox survival model showed that low diastolic pressure (alpha effect = -0.058±0.0013, p = 0.043) and a positive cumulative fluid balance (alpha effect = 0.04±0.003, p = 0.021) were independently associated with delirium. In conclusion, low diastolic pressure and a cumulative positive fluid balance but not hypoxemia were independently associated with development of delirium in patients with shock."

https://openalex.org/W2885744525,"Channelrhodopsins are light-sensitive ion channels whose reaction cycles involve conformation-coupled transfer of protons. Understanding how channelrhodopsins work is important for applications in optogenetics, where light activation of these proteins triggers changes in the transmembrane potential across excitable membranes. A fundamental open question is how the protein environment ensures that unproductive proton transfer from the retinal Schiff base to the nearby carboxylate counterion is avoided in the resting state of the channel. To address this question, we performed combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical proton transfer calculations with explicit treatment of the surrounding lipid membrane. The free energy profiles computed for proton transfer to the counterion, either via a direct jump or mediated by a water molecule, demonstrate that, when retinal is all-trans, water and protein electrostatic interactions largely favour the protonated retinal Schiff base state. We identified a conserved lysine group as an essential structural element for the proton transfer energetics in channelrhodopsins."
https://openalex.org/W2886758565,"Molecular chaperones are important regulators of protein folding and proteasomal removal of misfolded proteins. In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the co-chaperone DnaJ homology subfamily B member 1 (DNAJB1 or heat shock protein 40) is recruited to protein aggregates formed by the disease-causing mutant polyglutamine (polyQ) protein ataxin-3 (ATXN3). Over-expression of DNAJB1 reduces polyQ protein toxicity. Here, we identified two miRNAs, miR-370 and miR-543, that function in posttranscriptional regulation of DNAJB1 expression. MiRNAs are small endogenously produced RNAs controlling mRNA stability and play a role in polyQ disease pathogenesis. In human neuronal cultures derived from SCA3 patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, miR-370 and miR-543 levels are upregulated, while DNAJB1 expression is concurrently reduced. These findings suggest that downregulation of DNAJB1 by these two miRNAs is an early event that could contribute to SCA3 pathogenesis. Inhibition of these two miRNAs in turn could stabilize DNAJB1 and thereby be beneficial in SCA3 disease."

It resides on the premise of hidden capabilities—fundamental endowments underlying the productive structure. In general, measuring the capabilities behind economic complexity directly is difficult, and indirect measures have been suggested which exploit the fact that the presence of the capabilities is expressed in a country’s mix of products. We complement these studies by introducing a probabilistic framework which leverages Bayesian non-parametric techniques to extract the dominant features behind the comparative advantage in exported products. Based on economic evidence and trade data, we place a restricted Indian Buffet Process on the distribution of countries’ capability endowment, appealing to a culinary metaphor to model the process of capability acquisition. The approach comes with a unique level of interpretability, as it produces a concise and economically plausible description of the instantiated capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2886052425,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome causing thousands of deaths yearly worldwide. Sepsis is a result of infection and could lead to systemic inflammatory responses and organ failures. Additionally, blood cells, as the main cells in the immune systems, could be also affected by sepsis. Here, we have used different network analysis approaches, including Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI), and gene regulatory network, to dissect system-level response to sepsis by the main white blood cells. Gene expression profiles of Neutrophils (NTs), Dendritic Cells (DCs), and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) that were exposed to septic plasma were obtained and analyzed using bioinformatics approaches. Individual gene expression matrices and the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were prepared and used to construct several networks. Consequently, key regulatory modules and hub genes were detected through network analysis and annotated through ontology analysis extracted from DAVID database. Our results showed that septic plasma affected the regulatory networks in NTs, PBMCs more than the network in DCs. Gene ontology of DEGs revealed that signal transduction and immune cells responses are the most important biological processes affected by sepsis. On the other hand, network analysis detected modules and hub genes in each cell types. It was found that pathways involved in immune cells, signal transduction, and apoptotic processes are among the most affected pathways in the responses to sepsis. Altogether, we have found several hub genes including ADORA3, CD83 CDKN1A, FFAR2, GNAQ, IL1B, LTB, MAPK14, SAMD9L, SOCS1, and STAT1, which might specifically respond to sepsis infection. In conclusion, our results uncovered the system-level responses of the main white blood cells to sepsis and identified several hub genes with potential applications for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2885409152,"Gelsolin is a severing and capping protein that targets filamentous actin and regulates filament lengths near plasma membranes, contributing to cell movement and plasma membrane morphology. Gelsolin binds to the plasma membrane via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in a state that cannot cap F-actin, and gelsolin-capped actin filaments are uncapped by PIP2 leading to filament elongation. The process by which gelsolin is removed from PIP2 at the plasma membrane is currently unknown. Gelsolin also binds ATP with unknown function. Here we characterize the role of ATP on PIP2-gelsolin complex dynamics. Fluorophore-labeled PIP2 and ATP were used to study their interactions with gelsolin using steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, and Alexa488-labeled gelsolin was utilized to reconstitute the regulation of gelsolin binding to PIP2-containing phospholipid vesicles by ATP. Under physiological salt conditions ATP competes with PIP2 for binding to gelsolin, while calcium causes the release of ATP from gelsolin. These data suggest a cycle for gelsolin activity. Firstly, calcium activates ATP-bound gelsolin allowing it to sever and cap F-actin. Secondly, PIP2-binding removes the gelsolin cap from F-actin at low calcium levels, leading to filament elongation. Finally, ATP competes with PIP2 to release the calcium-free ATP-bound gelsolin, allowing it to undergo a further round of severing."

Here we aimed for a more complete and systematic linguistic model of TD, focused on (i) a more in-depth analysis of anomalies of reference as depending on the grammatical construction type in which they occur, and (ii) measures of formal grammatical complexity and errors. Narrative speech obtained from 40 patients with schizophrenia, 20 with TD and 20 without, and from 14 healthy controls matched on pre-morbid IQ, was rated blindly. Results showed that of 10 linguistic variables annotated, 4 showed significant differences between groups, including the two patient groups. These all concerned mis-uses of noun phrases (NPs) for purposes of reference, but showed sensitivity to how NPs were classed: definite and pronominal forms of reference were more affected than indefinite and non-pronominal (lexical) NPs. None of the measures of formal grammatical complexity and errors distinguished groups. We conclude that TD exhibits a specific and differentiated linguistic profile, which can illuminate TD neuro-cognitively and inform future neuroimaging studies, and can have clinical utility as a linguistic biomarker."

Previous evidence for such subcategorical information maintenance has come from paradigms that lack many of the demands typical to everyday language use. We ask whether information maintenance is also possible under more typical constraints, and in particular whether it can facilitate accent adaptation. In a web-based paradigm, participants listened to isolated foreign-accented words in one of three conditions: subtitles were displayed concurrently with the speech, after speech offset, or not displayed at all. The delays between speech offset and subtitle presentation were manipulated. In a subsequent test phase, participants then transcribed novel words in the same accent without the aid of subtitles. We find that subtitles facilitate accent adaptation, even when displayed with a 6 second delay. Listeners thus maintained subcategorical information for sufficiently long to allow it to benefit adaptation. We close by discussing what type of information listeners maintain—subcategorical phonetic information, or just uncertainty about speech categories."
https://openalex.org/W2885696128,"Between the 8th January and the 25th February 2016, the largest sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus mortality event ever recorded in the North Sea occurred with 30 sperm whales stranding in five countries within six weeks. All sperm whales were immature males. Groups were stratified by size, with the smaller animals stranding in the Netherlands, and the largest in England. The majority (n = 27) of the stranded animals were necropsied and/or sampled, allowing for an international and comprehensive investigation into this mortality event. The animals were in fair to good nutritional condition and, aside from the pathologies caused by stranding, did not exhibit significant evidence of disease or trauma. Infectious agents were found, including various parasite species, several bacterial and fungal pathogens and a novel alphaherpesvirus. In nine of the sperm whales a variety of marine litter was found. However, none of these findings were considered to have been the primary cause of the stranding event. Potential anthropogenic and environmental factors that may have caused the sperm whales to enter the North Sea were assessed. Once sperm whales enter the North Sea and head south, the water becomes progressively shallower (<40 m), making this region a global hotspot for sperm whale strandings. We conclude that the reasons for sperm whales to enter the southern North Sea are the result of complex interactions of extrinsic environmental factors. As such, these large mortality events seldom have a single ultimate cause and it is only through multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches that potentially multifactorial large-scale stranding events can be effectively investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2885733153,"Treated Rhizopora mucronata tannin (RMT) as a corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel and copper in oil and gas facilities was investigated. Corrosion rate of carbon-steel and copper in 3wt% NaCl solution by RMT was studied using chemical (weight loss method) and spectroscopic (FTIR) techniques at various temperatures in the ranges of 26-90°C. The weight loss data was compared to the electrochemical by the application of Faraday's law for the conversion of corrosion rate data from one system to another. The inhibitive efficiency of RMT was compared with commercial inhibitor sodium benzotriazole (BTA-S). The best concentration of RMT was 20% (w/v), increase in concentration of RMT decreased the corrosion rate and increased the inhibitive efficiency. Increase in temperature increased the corrosion rate and decreased the inhibitive efficiency but, the rate of corrosion was mild with RMT. The FTIR result shows the presence of hydroxyl group, aromatic group, esters and the substituted benzene group indicating the purity of the tannin. The trend of RMT was similar to that of BTA-S, but its inhibitive efficiency for carbon-steel was poor (6%) compared to RMT (59%). BTA-S was efficient for copper (76%) compared to RMT (74%) at 40% (w/v) and 20% (w/v) concentration respectively. RMT was efficient even at low concentration therefore, the use of RMT as a cost effective and environmentally friendly corrosion inhibiting agent for carbon steel and copper is herein proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2886346894,"Although the aggregation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) clearly plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), endosomal traffic dysfunction is considered to precede Aβ aggregation and trigger AD pathogenesis. A body of evidence suggests that the β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF) of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), which is the direct precursor of Aβ, accumulates in endosomes and causes vesicular traffic impairment. However, the mechanism underlying this impairment remains unclear. Here we identified TMEM30A as a candidate partner for βCTF. TMEM30A is a subcomponent of lipid flippase that translocates phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. TMEM30A physically interacts with βCTF in endosomes and may impair vesicular traffic, leading to abnormally enlarged endosomes. APP traffic is also concomitantly impaired, resulting in the accumulation of APP-CTFs, including βCTF. In addition, we found that expressed BACE1 accumulated in enlarged endosomes and increased Aβ production. Our data suggested that TMEM30A is involved in βCTF-dependent endosome abnormalities that are related to Aβ overproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2886505870,"The bidirectional regulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transitions (EMT) is key in tumorigenesis. Rho GTPases regulate this process via canonical pathways that impinge on the stability of cell-to-cell contacts, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell invasiveness. Here, we report that the Rho GTPase activators Vav2 and Vav3 utilize a new Rac1-dependent and miR-200c-dependent mechanism that maintains the epithelial state by limiting the abundance of the Zeb2 transcriptional repressor in breast cancer cells. In parallel, Vav proteins engage a mir-200c-independent expression prometastatic program that maintains epithelial cell traits only under 3D culture conditions. Consistent with this, the depletion of endogenous Vav proteins triggers mesenchymal features in epithelioid breast cancer cells. Conversely, the ectopic expression of an active version of Vav2 promotes mesenchymal-epithelial transitions using E-cadherin-dependent and independent mechanisms depending on the mesenchymal breast cancer cell line used. In silico analyses suggest that the negative Vav anti-EMT pathway is operative in luminal breast tumors. Gene signatures from the Vav-associated proepithelial and prometastatic programs have prognostic value in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2885681548,"Purpose The blood levels of Adiponectin, anti-inflammatory and anti-arteriosclerotic adipocytokine, decrease due to smoking and obesity. Cigarette smokers are generally known to gain weight after smoking cessation (SC). Nevertheless, precise changes in serum adiponectin levels after SC and specific effects of abdominal obesity on those changes remain unknown. The objective of this study was to elucidate the changes in serum adiponectin levels after SC and the effects of abdominal obesity on those changes. Methods In 86 patients (56 males and 30 females) who had successfully quit smoking, serum adiponectin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and 1 year after beginning SC. Results Body mass index and waist circumference (WC) were significantly increased 1 year after beginning SC. Adiponectin levels, however, did not change after SC. Using the median ΔWC (+2.8%) as the cutoff point, patients were then divided into two groups. The percent change in adiponectin levels from baseline to 1 year was significantly greater in the ΔWC < median group (−1.1%) than in the ΔWC ≥ median group (+8.1%) (p = 0.011). Conclusions Despite weight gain and increased abdominal obesity, serum adiponectin levels did not decrease after SC. Therefore, the beneficial effect of SC may eliminate the adverse effects of subsequent weight gain. Conversely, patients with less abdominal obesity had increased adiponectin levels 1 year after SC. Therefore, in such patients, the beneficial effect of SC on adiponectin levels is apparent."
https://openalex.org/W2886174501,"CLN3-Batten disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder involving seizures, visual, motor and cognitive decline, and premature death. The Cln3Δex7/8 mouse model recapitulates several phenotypic characteristics of the most common 1.02kb disease-associated deletion. Identification of reproducible biomarker(s) to facilitate longitudinal monitoring of disease progression and provide readouts for therapeutic response has remained elusive. One factor that has complicated the identification of suitable biomarkers in this mouse model has been that variations in animal husbandry appear to significantly influence readouts. In the current study, we cross-compared a number of biological parameters in blood from Cln3Δex7/8 mice and control, non-disease mice on the same genetic background from multiple animal facilities in an attempt to better define a surrogate marker of CLN3-Batten disease. Interestingly, we found that significant differences between Batten and non-disease mice found at one site were generally not maintained across different facilities. Our results suggest that colony variation in the Cln3Δex7/8 mouse model of CLN3-Batten disease can influence potential biomarkers of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2886572703,"Recent studies have proposed using well-defined relationships between network productivity and accumulation-otherwise known as Network or Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (network MFDs)-to model the dynamics of large-scale urban traffic networks. Network MFDs have been used to develop a variety of network-wide traffic control policies to improve a network's operational efficiency. However, the relationship between a network's MFD and its safety performance has not been well explored. This study proposes the existence of a Macroscopic Safety Diagram (MSD) that relates safety performance (e.g., likelihood of a crash occurring or number of vehicle conflicts observed) with the current network state (i.e., average density) in an urban traffic network. We theoretically posit a relationship between a network's MSD and its MFD based on the average maneuver envelop of vehicles traveling within the network. Based on this model, we show that the density associated with maximum crash propensity is always expected to be larger than the density associated with maximum network productivity. This finding suggests that congested states are not only inefficient, but they might also be associated with more crashes, which can be both more unsafe and lead to decreased network reliability. These theoretical results are validated using surrogate safety assessment metrics in microsimulation and limited field empirical data from a small arterial network in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The existence of such MSDs can be used to develop more comprehensive network-wide control policies that can ensure both safe, efficient and reliable network operations."
https://openalex.org/W2886165755,"Despite advances in management of immunosuppression, graft rejection remains a significant clinical problem in solid organ transplantation. Non-invasive biomarkers of graft rejection can facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of acute rejection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of heparan sulfate as a novel biomarker for acute cellular rejection. Heparan sulfate is released from the extracellular matrix during T-cell infiltration of graft tissue via the action of the enzyme heparanase. In a murine heart transplant model, serum heparan sulfate is significantly elevated during rejection of cardiac allografts. Moreover, expression of the enzyme heparanase is significantly increased in activated T-cells. In human studies, plasma heparan sulfate is significantly elevated in kidney transplant recipients with biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection compared to healthy controls, recipients with stable graft function, and recipients without acute cellular rejection on biopsy. Taken together, these findings support further investigation of heparan sulfate as a novel biomarker of acute cellular rejection in solid organ transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2886796072,"Aims Associations between stuttering in childhood and a broad spectrum of risk factors, associated factors and comorbidities were examined in two large epidemiological studies. Subtypes of stuttering were then identified based on latent class analysis (LCA). Methods Data were from two representative Swiss population samples: PsyCoLaus (N = 4,874, age 35–82 years) and the ZInEP Epidemiology Survey (N = 1,500, age 20–41 years). Associations between stuttering and sociodemographic characteristics, familial aggregation, comorbidity and psychosocial risk / associated factors were investigated in both samples. LCAs were conducted on selected items from people in both samples who reported having stuttered in childhood. Results Initial analyses linked early anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder and overanxious disorder, to stuttering (PsyCoLaus). ADHD was associated with stuttering in both datasets. In the analyses of risk / associated factors, dysfunctional parental relationships, inter-parental violence and further childhood adversities were mutual predictors of stuttering. Moreover, comorbidities were seen with hay fever, asthma, eczema and psoriasis (PsyCoLaus). Subsequent LCA identified an unspecific group of persons who self-reported that they stuttered and a group defined by associations with psychosocial adversities (ZINEP, PsyCoLaus) and atopic diseases (PsyCoLaus). Conclusions The two subtypes of developmental stuttering have different risk / associated factors and comorbidity patterns. Most of the factors are associated with vulnerability mechanisms that occur early in life and that have also been linked with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Both psychosocial and biological factors appear to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of stuttering."
https://openalex.org/W2887165377,"Nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2) has three paralogs in mammals, NM2A, NM2B, and NM2C, which have both unique and overlapping functions in cell migration, formation of cell–cell adhesions, and cell polarity. Their assembly into homo- and heterotypic bipolar filaments in living cells is primarily regulated by phosphorylation of the N-terminally bound regulatory light chain. Here, we present evidence that the equilibrium between these filaments and single NM2A and NM2B molecules can be controlled via S100 calcium-binding protein interactions and phosphorylation at the C-terminal end of the heavy chains. Furthermore, we show that in addition to S100A4, other members of the S100 family can also mediate disassembly of homotypic NM2A filaments. Importantly, these proteins can selectively remove NM2A molecules from heterotypic filaments. We also found that tail phosphorylation (at Ser-1956 and Ser-1975) of NM2B by casein kinase 2, as well as phosphomimetic substitutions at sites targeted by protein kinase C (PKC) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7), down-regulates filament assembly in an additive fashion. Tail phosphorylation of NM2A had a comparatively minor effect on filament stability. S100 binding and tail phosphorylation therefore preferentially disassemble NM2A and NM2B, respectively. These two distinct mechanisms are likely to contribute to the temporal and spatial sorting of the two NM2 paralogs within heterotypic filaments. The existence of multiple NM2A-depolymerizing S100 paralogs offers the potential for diverse regulatory inputs modulating NM2A filament disassembly in cells and provides functional redundancy under both physiological and pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2887578203,"N-Formylation of the Met-tRNAMet by the nuclearly encoded mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTFMT) has been found to be a key determinant of protein synthesis initiation in mitochondria. In humans, mutations in the MTFMT gene result in Leigh syndrome, a progressive and severe neurometabolic disorder. However, the absolute requirement of formylation of Met-tRNAMet for protein synthesis in mammalian mitochondria is still debated. Here, we generated a Mtfmt-KO mouse fibroblast cell line and demonstrated that N-formylation of the first methionine via fMet-tRNAMet by MTFMT is not an absolute requirement for initiation of protein synthesis. However, it differentially affected the efficiency of synthesis of mtDNA-coded polypeptides. Lack of methionine N-formylation did not compromise the stability of these individual subunits but had a marked effect on the assembly and stability of the OXPHOS complexes I and IV and on their supercomplexes. In summary, N-formylation is not essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis but is critical for efficient synthesis of several mitochondrially encoded peptides and for OXPHOS complex stability and assembly into supercomplexes."

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has neuroprotective properties of reducing excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation and apoptosis in rodent models. We aim to study whether post hypoxic administration of i.v. DHA will reduce H+MRS biomarkers and gene expression of inflammation and apoptosis both with and without hypothermia in a large animal model.Fifty-five piglets were randomized to severe global hypoxia (N = 48) or not (Sham, N = 7). Hypoxic piglets were further randomized by factorial design: Vehicle (VEH), DHA, VEH + Hypothermia (HT), or DHA + HT. 5 mg/kg DHA was given intravenously 210 min after end of hypoxia. Two-way ANOVA analyses were performed with DHA and hypothermia as main effects.Cortical lactate/N-acetylaspartate (Lac/NAA) was significantly reduced in DHA + HT compared to HT. DHA had significant main effects on increasing N-acetylaspartate and glutathione in hippocampus. Therapeutic hypothermia significantly reduced the Lac/NAA ratio and protein expression of IL-1β and TNFα in hippocampus and reduced Troponin T in serum. Neuropathology showed significant differences between sham and hypoxia, but no differences between intervention groups.DHA and therapeutic hypothermia significantly improve specific H+MRS biomarkers in this short-term follow up model of hypoxia-ischemia. Longer recovery periods are needed to evaluate whether DHA can offer translational neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2885873449,"The BRAFV600E mutation is the most prevalent driver mutation of sporadic papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). It was previously shown that prenatal or postnatal expression of BRAFV600E under elevated TSH levels induced thyroid cancers in several genetically engineered mouse models. In contrast, we found that postnatal expression of BRAFV600E under physiologic TSH levels failed to develop thyroid cancers in conditional transgenic Tg(LNL-BrafV600E) mice injected in the thyroid with adenovirus expressing Cre under control of the thyroglobulin promoter (Ad-TgP-Cre). In this study, we first demonstrated that BrafCA/+ mice carrying a Cre-activated allele of BrafV600E exhibited higher transformation efficiency than Tg(LNL-BrafV600E) mice when crossed with TPO-Cre mice. As a result, most BrafCA/+ mice injected with Ad-TgP-Cre developed thyroid cancers in 1 year. Histologic examination showed follicular or cribriform-like structures with positive TG and PAX staining and no colloid formation. Some tumors also had papillary structure component with lower TG expression. Concomitant PTEN haploinsufficiency in injected BrafCA/+;Ptenf/+ mice induced tumors predominantly exhibiting papillary structures and occasionally undifferentiated solid patterns with normal to low PAX expression and low to absent TG expression. Typical nuclear features of human PTC and extrathyroidal invasion were observed primarily in the latter mice. The percentages of pERK-, Ki67- and TUNEL-positive cells were all higher in the latter. In conclusion, we established novel thyroid cancer mouse models in which postnatal expression of BRAFV600E alone under physiologic TSH levels induces PTC. Simultaneous PTEN haploinsufficiency tends to promote tumor growth and de-differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2887502831,"Background Anemia is a global health problem associated with short- and long-term consequences especially in children. The incidence of anemia along with the factors associated with its increased or decreased risk is not yet well studied in Lebanon. Our study aims at determining the demographics of this health burden and identifying some of the important factors linked to it among the pediatric population. Methods A 4-months cross-sectional study was performed between August and November 2017 including 295 children aged 1 month to 12 years, who were hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital located in South Lebanon. We analyzed the different demographic data, age, gender, breast feeding duration, solid food introduction, iron supplementation and disease of diagnosis in association with multiple hematological parameters. Results The prevalence of both mild and moderate anemia was 71.8 and 25.4%, with only 2 cases of severe anemia encountered among children aged 6 months or above. Results showed that the risk of anemia increases by around 3.4 folds among malnourished children than in well-nourished children. This risk also decreased by almost 42% in children receiving iron supplement. Conclusion In consideration to the fact that anemia is a prevalent disease in the Lebanese childhood population, especially in infancy, simple preventive measures such as proper nutritional habits and supplementation of iron rich food to children are highly recommended and should be respected by public health providers."
https://openalex.org/W2887891263,"Renal dysfunction and anaemia are common in patients with acute heart failure (HF). It is not known whether their combined presence has additive prognostic value. We investigated their prognostic value separately and in combination, on prognosis in acute HF patients. Furthermore, we examined whether the improvement in prognosis was comparable between patients with and without renal dysfunction.This prospective registry includes 1783 patients admitted to the (Intensive) Coronary Care Unit for acute HF in the period of 1985-2008. The outcome measure was the composite of all-cause mortality, heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation. In patients without renal dysfunction, anemia was associated with worse 30-day outcome (HR 2.91; [95% CI 1.69-5.00]), but not with 10-year outcome (HR 1.13 [95% CI 0.93-1.37]). On the contrary, anemia was found to influence prognosis in patients with renal dysfunction, both at 30 days (HR 1.93 [95% CI 1.33-2.80]) and at 10 years (HR 1.27 [95% CI 1.10-1.47]). Over time, the 10-year survival rate improved in patients with preserved renal function (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.55-0.97]), but not in patients with renal dysfunction.The long-term prognosis of acute HF patients with a preserved renal function was found to have improved significantly. However, the prognosis of patients with renal dysfunction did not change. Anemia was a strong prognosticator for short-term outcome in all patients. In patients with renal dysfunction, anemia was also associated with impaired long-term prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2887975663,"Cancer cells secrete procathepsin D, and its secretion is enhanced by estradiol. Although alterations in the pro-enzyme intracellular transport have been reported, the mechanism by which it is secreted remains poorly understood. In this work, we have studied the influence of estradiol on the expression and distribution of the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), which would be a key molecule to ensure the proper localization of the enzyme to lysosomes in breast cancer cells. Immunoblotting studies demonstrated that the expression of CD-MPR is higher in MCF-7 cells, as compared to other breast cancer and non-tumorigenic cells. This expression correlated with high levels of cathepsin D (CatD) in these cells. By immunofluorescence, this receptor mostly co-localized with a Golgi marker in all cell types, exhibiting an additional peripheral labelling in MCF-7 cells. In addition, CD-MPR showed great differences regarding to cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. On the other hand, the treatment with estradiol induced an increase in CD-MPR and CatD expression and a re-distribution of both proteins towards the cell periphery. These effects were blocked by the anti-estrogen tamoxifen. Moreover, a re-distribution of CD-MPR to plasma membrane-enriched fractions, analyzed by gradient centrifugation, was observed after estradiol treatment. We conclude that, in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells, CD-MPR and CatD are distributed together, and that their expression and distribution are influenced by estradiol. These findings strongly support the involvement of the CD-MPR in the pro-enzyme transport in MCF-7 cells, suggesting the participation of this receptor in the procathepsin D secretion previously reported in breast cancer cells."

The psychometric properties of this new patient-reported outcome measure were investigated in order to develop an improved version. Methods Young adults registered at two low vision rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands were invited to complete the 141-item PAI-YA (n = 186) in a test-retest design. To select the best items for the PAI-YA, response frequencies were assessed and a graded response model (GRM) was fitted. Item reduction was informed by response frequencies, insufficient item information, and participants’ comments. Fit indices, item and person (theta) parameters were computed, after which known-group validity, concurrent validity, test-retest reliability and feasibility were studied. Results Response frequencies, violation of assumptions and item information informed the elimination of 81 items, resulting in a unidimensional PAI-YA showing satisfactory fit to the GRM. Known-group validity showed significant differences for visual impairment, financial situation, sex, educational situation and employment situation. Concurrent validity with (scales of) other questionnaires showed moderate to strong expected correlations. Test-retest reliability was satisfactory for all items (kappa 0.47–0.87), as was agreement (63.1–92.0%). Four items and one response option were added to increase feasibility. Conclusions This study contributes to the development and assessment of psychometric properties of the PAI-YA, which resulted in an improved 64-item version. Evidence was provided for construct validity, known-group validity, concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. These results are an important step in the development of a feasible instrument to investigate and monitor rehabilitation needs of visually impaired young adults, to structure the intake procedure at low vision rehabilitation services and to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2886463127,"This study uses a maze navigation task in conjunction with a quasi-scripted, prosodically controlled speech task to examine acoustic and articulatory accommodation in pairs of interacting speakers. The experiment uses a dual electromagnetic articulography set-up to collect synchronized acoustic and articulatory kinematic data from two facing speakers simultaneously. We measure the members of a dyad individually before they interact, while they are interacting in a cooperative task, and again individually after they interact. The design is ideally suited to measure speech convergence, divergence, and persistence effects during and after speaker interaction. This study specifically examines how convergence and divergence effects during a dyadic interaction may be related to prosodically salient positions, such as preceding a phrase boundary. The findings of accommodation in fine-grained prosodic measures illuminate our understanding of how the realization of linguistic phrasal structure is coordinated across interacting speakers. Our findings on individual speaker variability and the time course of accommodation provide novel evidence for accommodation at the level of cognitively specified motor control of individual articulatory gestures. Taken together, these results have implications for understanding the cognitive control of interactional behavior in spoken language communication."

Numerous Computed Tomography (CT) protocols are available and radiologists' choices are influenced by the clinical history provided. We hypothesize that the quality of the initial communication between referring physicians and radiologists greatly affects the utilization of health resources and subsequent patient care. The purpose of this pilot study was to employ a grading system to quantitatively evaluate a provided history. We also sought to evaluate inter-rater reliability by having radiologists evaluate sample histories and finally, to assess whether the quality of history has an impact on the number of CT protocols radiologists choose as potentially appropriate, with less potential protocols being seen as a positive outcome.Four reviewers, (2 attendings and 2 residents) evaluated 350 consecutive clinical histories provided for patients presenting to a tertiary care Emergency Department (ED) between September-October, 2012. Reviewers graded histories on a 5-point scale using 4 categories of criteria. This includes a) presenting complaint, b) relevant past medical history or symptom evolution, c) objective laboratory or prior examination results and d) differential diagnosis.There was substantial agreement among all four reviewers when evaluating the quality of history, ICC 0.61, (95% CI 0.48-0.71). In particular, agreement amongst attending radiologists was substantial, with ICC 0.69 (0.48-0.80). Significant negative correlation was observed between history grade and number of potentially appropriate protocols in 3 of 4 reviewers (Spearman's rho: -0.394, -0.639, -0.864, p <0.0001 for these reviewers). This correlation was significantly stronger for attending radiologists (Spearman's rho: -0.763, 95% CI -0.7933 to -0.731; p<0.0001). Agreement was poor among reviewers when asked exactly how many protocols could potentially be used to answer the clinical question based on provided history, ICC 0.08, (95% -0.03-0.13).Although there is still variability in radiologists' approach to protocoling urgent studies, a more comprehensive requisition history narrowed the number of protocols considered."
https://openalex.org/W2887481091,"Eelgrass (Zostera marina) forms extensive beds in coastal and estuarine environments and provides various ecosystem functions. The aboveground part of eelgrass provides habitats for other types of primary producers such as epiphytic microalgae and for epifaunal invertebrate grazers. Because of the different sizes, generation times and resource requirements, these different types of producers and consumers may be affected by different sets of biotic/abiotic factors over multiple spatial scales. We examined the spatial variations in three functional groups of eelgrass beds (eelgrass, epiphytic microalgae and epifaunal invertebrates) and the abiotic/biotic factors responsible for these variations in three lagoons with different environmental properties at the eastern region of Hokkaido Island, Japan. The spatial scale responsible for the variation in the biomasses of the three functional groups varied, where within-lagoon variation was important for eelgrass and epifauna but among-lagoon variation was important for microalgae. The environmental predictors for the observed spatial variations also differed among the different functional groups, with variation in eelgrass biomass related to depth, nutrient and salinity, epiphytes to water temperature, eelgrass biomass and water column chlorophyll and epifauna mainly to eelgrass biomass. These results revealed that the level of importance of among- and within-lagoon environmental gradients vary in the different functional groups of the eelgrass bed community. The large-scale variation in pelagic productivity, which is tightly related to the ocean current regimes, is likely responsible for the great among-lagoon variation in microalgae. The local variations in environmental factors such as salinity and nutrients, which change with alterations in terrestrial river inputs, are likely related to the great variations in eelgrass and epifauna within the ecosystem. The observed relationship of epifauna with eelgrass biomass indicates the importance of non-trophic plant-animal interactions because epifauna utilize eelgrass as habitat. We therefore emphasize the importance of evaluating spatial variations at multiple scales to further understand the functions of coastal and estuarine ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2885820561,"When reproduction in fungi takes place by sexual means, meiosis enables the formation of haploid spores from diploid precursor cells. Copper is required for completion of meiosis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. During the meiotic program, genes encoding copper transporters exhibit distinct temporal expression profiles. In the case of the major facilitator copper transporter 1 (Mfc1), its maximal expression is induced during middle-phase meiosis and requires the presence of the Zn6Cys2 binuclear cluster-type transcription factor Mca1. In this study, we further characterize the mechanism by which Mca1 affects the copper-starvation-induced expression of mfc1+. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach, results showed that a functional Mca1-TAP occupies the mfc1+ promoter irrespective of whether this gene is transcriptionally active. Under conditions of copper starvation, results showed that the presence of Mca1 promotes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy along the mfc1+ transcribed region. In contrast, Pol II did not significantly occupy the mfc1+ locus in meiotic cells that were incubated in the presence of copper. Further analysis by ChIP assays revealed that binding of Pol II to chromatin at the chromosomal locus of mfc1+ is exclusively detected during meiosis and absent in cells proliferating in mitosis. Protein function analysis of a series of internal mutants compared to the full-length Mca1 identified a minimal form of Mca1 consisting of its DNA-binding domain (residues 1 to 150) fused to the amino acids 299 to 600. This shorter form is sufficient to enhance Pol II occupancy at the mfc1+ locus under low copper conditions. Taken together, these results revealed novel characteristics of Mca1 and identified an internal region of Mca1 that is required to promote Pol II-dependent mfc1+ transcription during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2887468568,"The relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical variables in patients suspected to have Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is uncertain. We aimed to determine which MRI features of CJD (positive or negative), previously described in vivo, accurately identify CJD, are most reliably detected, vary with disease duration, and whether combined clinical and imaging features increase diagnostic accuracy for CJD. Prospective patients suspected of having CJD were referred to the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit between 1994–2004; post-mortem, brains were sent for MRI and histopathology. Two neuroradiologists independently assessed MRI for atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, and caudate, lentiform and pulvinar signals, blind to histopathological diagnosis and clinical details. We examined differences in variable frequencies using Fisher’s exact tests, and associations between variables and CJD in logistic regression models. Amongst 200 cases, 118 (59%) with a histopathological diagnosis of CJD and 82 (41%) with histopathological diagnoses other than CJD, a logistic regression model including age, disease duration at death, atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, bright or possibly bright caudate, and present pulvinar sign correctly classified 81% of cases as CJD versus not CJD. Pulvinar sign alone was not independently associated with an increased likelihood of histopathologically-confirmed CJD (of any subtype) or sporadic CJD after adjustment for age at death, disease duration, atrophy, white matter hyperintensities or caudate signal; despite the large sample, data sparsity precluded investigation of the association of pulvinar sign with variant CJD. No imaging feature varied significantly with disease duration. Of the positive CJD signs, neuroradiologists most frequently agreed on the presence or absence of atrophy (agreements in 169/200 cases [84.5%]). Combining patient age, and disease duration, with absence of atrophy and white matter hyperintensities and presence of increased caudate signal and pulvinar sign predicts CJD with good accuracy. Autopsy remains essential."
https://openalex.org/W2885492307,"The purpose of this prospective study was to describe the normal anatomy and provide reference ranges for measurements of thoracic radiography on Squirrel monkeys (n = 13). Thoracic radiography is a common non-invasive diagnostic tool for both cardiac and non-cardiac thoracic structures. Furthermore cardiac disease is a common condition in captive primates. In this study, left-right lateral, right-left lateral and dorsoventral projections of 13 healthy Squirrel monkeys were reviewed during their annual health examinations. The mean Vertebral Heart Score on the left-right and right-left lateral projections were 8,98 ± 0,25 and 8,85 ± 0,35 respectively. The cardio-thoracic ratio on the dorsoventral projection was 0,68 ± 0,03. The trachea to inlet ratio was 0,33 ± 0,04. Other measurements are provided for the skeletal, cardiac and respiratory systems. Knowledge of the normal radiographic thoracic anatomy is fundamental in clinical as well as research settings for accurate diagnosis of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2885936516,"An effective method for research of macro-morphological characterization and its kinetics was developed by studying the macro-morphological characteristics of Mortierella alpina, an oleaginous zygomycete widely used to produce lipids rich in PUFA, in function of culture medium composition and to link morphological features of fungus with the level of lipid production. A number of distinct morphological forms including hollow pellets, fluffy pellets and freely dispersed mycelia were obtained by changing the fermentation factors. By fitting a Logistic curve, the maximum specific growth rate (μmax)was obtained, which determined the final mycelia morphology. μmax of 0.6584 in three kind of morphological forms is the more appropriate. According to the Luedeking-Piret equation fitting, α≠0 and β≠0, lipid production was partially associated with the hyphal growth, fluffy pellets which turn glucose into lipidwas more effective than the other two kinds of morphological forms."
https://openalex.org/W2886771712,"DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic modification involved in regulating the expression of mammalian genomes. A variety of experimental approaches to generate genome-wide or whole-genome DNA methylation data have emerged in recent years. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) is one of the major tools used in whole-genome epigenetic studies. However, analyzing this data in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and speed still remains an important challenge. Existing methods, such as BATMAN and MEDIPS, analyze MeDIP-seq data by dividing the whole genome into equal length windows and assume that each CpG of the same window has the same methylation level. More precise work is necessary to estimate the methylation level of each CpG site in the whole genome. In this paper, we propose a Statistical Inferences with MeDIP-seq Data (SIMD) to infer the methylation level for each CpG site. In addition, we analyze a real dataset for DNA methylation. The results show that our method displays improved precision in detecting differentially methylated CpG sites compared to the existing method. To meet the demands of the application, we have developed an R package called ""SIMD"", which is freely available in https://github.com/FocusPaka/SIMD."
https://openalex.org/W2885950720,"The exocyst is a molecular tether that retains secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane prior to SNARE-mediated docking and fusion. However, individual exocyst complex components (EXOCs) may also function independently of exocyst assembly. Alternative splice variants of EXOC mRNA and paralogs of EXOC genes have been described and several have been attributed functions that may be independent of the exocyst complex. Here we describe a novel splice variant of murine Exoc3l2, which we term Exoc3l2a. We discuss possible functional implications of the resulting domain excision from this isoform of EXOC3L2 based on structural similarities with its paralog M-Sec (EXOC3L3), which is implicated in tunneling nanotube formation. The identification of this Exoc3l2 splice variant expands the potential for subunit diversity within the exocyst and for alternative functionality of this component independently of the exocyst."
