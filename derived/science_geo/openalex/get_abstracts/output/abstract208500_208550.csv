https://openalex.org/W1972388161,"Testicular biopsies were obtained at various intervals after intratesticular injections of tritiated thymidine. Radioautographs revealed that the most mature labeled germ cells were the preleptotene spermatocytes at 1 hour, the midpachytene spermatocytes at 16 days, and the immature spermatids at 32 days after injection. These results indicated that one cycle of the seminiferous epithelium lasts 16 days, and the whole of spermatogenesis is estimated to consume approximately 64 days."
https://openalex.org/W2073536631,"A STRAIN of mice NZB/BL suffering from an autoimmune type of hæmolytic anæmia has been described1,2. Since then it has been shown that approximately 4 per cent of this strain have positive lupus erythematosus cell tests and that many of the animals show renal changes resembling those seen in human systemic lupus erythematosus2,3. In this paper it was also shown that F1 and F2 progeny derived from a cross between mice of the NZB/BL and the NZY/BL strains showed a low incidence of hæmolytic anæmia but 25 per cent of the animals had positive lupus erythematosus cell tests and all had renal changes resembling lupus nephritis. These animals died from renal failure within 18–24 months of age."
https://openalex.org/W2081518255,Scopolamine hydrobromide disrupts the learned behavior of rats in a predictable manner. Physiological saline mimics to some extent the effect of the drug when the two substances are alternately administered in a series of injections. This placebo effect appears to be an instance of simple Pavlovian conditioning.

These abnormal thresholds are not affected by the administration of carbohydrate-active steroids."

https://openalex.org/W2022163122,"The replicating form of single-stranded DNA virus has been isolated in pure form by chromatography on columns of methylated albumin. Its buoyant density in CsCl and ""melting temperature"" are characteristic of a double stranded DNA structure containing 43 percent guanine-cytosine. The nearest neighbors to uridylate were compared in the RNA synthesized when replicating-form DNA and mature single-stranded DNA were employed as templates in an in vitro system. The mature DNA component of the replicating duplex does not serve as the sole source of complementary RNA. The results agree best with the assumption that both strands of the replicating form function as templates. It is important to note that this is contrary to the situation found in the intact cell where only one of the two strands appears to be transcribed into message."
https://openalex.org/W2021433611,The rapidly labeled RNA from both the nuclei and cytoplasm of mouse liver cells can be bound specifically to mouse DNA. The bound fraction differs in base composition and metabolic stability from the bulk RNA. There is considerable cross reaction between this RNA and the DNA obtained from calf thymus.
https://openalex.org/W2059694772,Normal surroundings appear curved when viewed through wedge prism eyeglasses. But prolonged viewing of uniformly curved lines makes them appear less curved. An environment specially patterned to prevent the appearance of curvature when viewed through a prism made possible the demonstration of change in apparent curvature wholly dependent upon the visual feedback accompanying self-produced movement of the prism-wearer.

These neurons received many synaptic endings which arose from collaterals of the acoustic fibers. The axons of the neurons ascended toward the cochlear nuclei. Similar neurons were found in the mouse, but not in the bat or cat."

https://openalex.org/W2050340827,"An intramuscular injection of alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine ( 100 mg/ kg), which differentially depletes serotonin and norepinephrine in both brain and heart, was given to two groups of pigeons trained to peck at a key for food. The first group received an injection 12 hours before the daily session and showed no behavioral effect. Response rates of birds in the second group, which were injected 30 minutes after the start of the daily session, decreased and returned to normal within 9 hours after injection. Preliminary data on brain serotonin of pigeons indicate that the disruption of the behavior follows the same time course as the change in serotonin."

The adaptation develops rapidly in the first two days of the wearing of the spectacles, and seems to be a special reac ion to the relative change in illuminance at intensity gradients on the retina."

https://openalex.org/W2030407222,"USING the technique of nuclear transfer1, it has been shown that many of the cellular properties of the large, uninucleate amœbæ, Amoeba proteus and A. discoides, are influenced by self-replicating cytoplasmic hereditary determinants. The characters determined in this way are those which depend on the way in which macromolecules, the specificity of which has been determined by nuclear genes, are organized into functional units2."

https://openalex.org/W2059698714,"THE effect of volatile fatty acids as growth factors for rumen bacteria is well known, but in most cases so far reported the branched-chain fatty acids, sometimes in combination with straight chain acids, have been found to be most effective. In a recent paper, Bryant and Robinson1 mentioned that their results showed the importance of acetate in the nutrition of many species of bovine rumen bacteria. However, their strains of S. ruminantium varied in the response to volatile fatty acids, a mixture of such acids other than acetate, propionate and n-butyrate baing stimulatory or essential, while acetate was stimulatory to two strains, but only in the absence of casein hydrolysate. Hobson and Mann2 earlier reported that acetate stimulated the growth of isolates of sheep rumen S. ruminantium and some further observations are described in this communication."

https://openalex.org/W2040201861,DURING the examination of human beings we have noted that when salicylamide was given orally during late pregnancy the blood concentrations of both the free salicylamide and glucuronide conjugate of it greatly differed from those found in non-pregnant control subjects. These changes might be caused either by disturbed resorption or impaired conjugation or by both. The possible role of an altered hepatic detoxication function during pregnancy also presents an interesting problem in this connexion.

https://openalex.org/W2037110697,"Two-dimensional electrophoresis by the method of Poulik and Smithies1 provides a powerful tool for the identification of serum protein bands separated in unidimensional starch-gel electrophoresis. It has in some cases revealed the presence of unsuspected components which are masked by others in the unidimensional run2. The method is, however, severely limited by small loading of protein sample possible by means of filter-paper insertion. Some improvement may be gained by making the preliminary run in agar where not only is the loading-higher but also the resolution is more powerful than on paper. Thus two α1 and two α2 components are to be distinguished in agar runs of rabbit serum3."

https://openalex.org/W2036684362,"THE identification of the origin of various animal proteins proved possible by the agar-gel double diffusion technique1. Antisera were prepared in rabbits by multiple injections of alum-precipitated animal sera. Antigens were prepared from animal sera and tissue extracts, tick blood-meals, sun-dried meat or biltong and uncooked sausage meat. They were diffused overnight at 25° C against known antisera simultaneously with the homologous antigen. The agar gels were prepared from 1 per cent agar in borate buffer at pH 8.6 and were about 3 mm thick. A seven-well pattern was used consisting of a 9.5-mm diameter central well set 10 mm from the 7-mm diameter peripheral antigen wells."

Barbiturates and similar anæsthetics have to be given carefully on a known weight basis, and the mortality due to respiratory arrest is large if compared with that in small-animal practice. The mechanics of casting the subject is a problem in many animals and may easily lead to injury and death, and which may only partially be overcome by preliminary injection of a neuromuscular blocking agent, such as succinylcholine and gallamine triethiodide."
