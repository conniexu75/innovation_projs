Suppressor mutations that rescue temperature-sensitive sec14 mutants provide an approach for determining the role of Sec14p in secretion. One suppressor, sac1-22, causes accumulation of PtdIns(4)P.SAC1 encodes a phosphatase that can hydrolyze PtdIns(4)P and certain other phosphoinositides. These findings suggest that PtdIns(4)P is limiting in sec14 cells and that elevation of PtdIns(4)P production can suppress the secretory defect. Correspondingly, we found that PtdIns(4)P levels were decreased significantly in sec14-3 mutants shifted to 37 °C and that sec14-3 cells could grow at an otherwise nonpermissive temperature (34 °C) when carrying a plasmid overexpressingPIK1, encoding one of two essential PtdIns 4-kinases. This effect is specific because overexpression of the other PtdIns 4-kinase gene (STT4) or a PtdIns 3-kinase gene (VPS34) did not rescue sec14-3 cells. To further address Pik1p function in secretion, two differentpik1 ts mutants were examined. Upon shift to restrictive temperature (37 °C), the PtdIns(4)P levels dropped by about 60% in both pik1 ts strains within 1 h. During the same period, cells displayed a reduction (40–50%) in release of a secreted enzyme (invertase). However, similar treatment did not effect maturation of a vacuolar enzyme (carboxypeptidase Y). These findings indicate that, first, PtdIns(4)P limitation is a major contributing factor to the secretory defect in sec14 cells; second, Sec14p function is coupled to the action of Pik1p, and; third, PtdIns(4)P has an important role in the Golgi-to-plasma membrane stage of secretion.

Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). From the ER, secretory proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus, through the subcompartments of the Golgi, and then to the cell surface or to certain intracellular organelles, all via small membrane-bound vesicles (transport vesicles) (2Rothman J.E.

Cargo proteins are packaged into transport vesicles that bud from one compartment and fuse with another. Mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion are conserved from yeast to mammalian cells (3Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because of its tractability for genetic analysis, bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has proven to be a useful organism to identify gene products required for various events in secretion. Genetic screens, first applied by Schekman and co-workers (6Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), resulted in the isolation of temperature-sensitive secmutants that displayed defects in different stages of secretion at the nonpermissive temperature. Characterization of the corresponding normal (SEC) genes has pinpointed many proteins necessary for secretory processes; and, a large number of gene products are now known to function at various steps in the secretory pathway (reviewed in Ref.7Kaiser C.A.

This phospholipid exchange protein is relatively specific for PtdIns in vitro; for example, Sec14p does not interact detectably with PtdIns (4Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T.

Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6447-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and for protein export from the Golgi (11Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that Sec14p also acts as a sensor of the PtdIns/PtdCho ratio in Golgi compartments by serving as a direct regulator of an enzyme in PtdCho biosynthesis (15Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the precise mechanism by which Sec14p action contributes to the process of protein secretion has remained obscure. It has been proposed that diacylglycerol (DAG) plays a key role in the budding of vesicles from the Golgi compartment (16Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached on the basis of analysis of the lipid composition in a mutant that does not require Sec14p function for growth and secretion. The strain examined carries both the sec14–3mutation 2In many publications, including our own (19Stock S.D. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol.

However, the sec14 allele in CTY1-1A was derived from strain SF292-2A and was originally designated sec14-3 (11Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Hence, the latter designation (sec14-3) has been adopted here. 2In many publications, including our own (19Stock S.D.

McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). M(IP)2C is the terminal sphingolipid in S. cerevisiae (17Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and its biosynthesis by Ipt1p is coupled to PtdIns consumption and DAG production (18Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Wells G.B. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29620-29625Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One of our laboratories recently re-examined the properties of thesec14-3 sac1-22 double mutant and found that the species attributed to M(IP)2C had been misidentified and that suppression did not require either Ipt1p function or an elevated DAG level (19Stock S.D. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12979-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of phospholipid composition showed that the sec14-3 sac1-22 cells contained 8-fold more PtdIns(4)P than either sec14-3 SAC1 or SEC14 SAC1 strains (19Stock S.D. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12979-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fact that a sac1 loss-of-function mutation caused an elevation in PtdIns(4)P was readily explained by the contemporaneous demonstration that Sac1p is a phosphoinositide phosphatase (20Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-13001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggested that, instead of DAG, PtdIns(4)P might have a key role in constitutive secretion in yeast. In mammalian cells, there is some evidence for involvement of a derivative, PtdIns(4,5)P2, in regulated secretion, especially in neurons (21Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. Sihra T.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5594-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae possesses two essential genes (PIK1and STT4) that encode PtdIns 4-kinase isoforms (23Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pik1p is a cytosolic enzyme (25Flanagan C.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that can be targeted to membranes via its interaction with a small Ca2+-binding protein (26Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). One report described Pik1p in the nucleus and suggested that loss ofPIK1 function interferes with cytokinesis through effects on the actin cytoskeleton (27Garcia-Bustos J.F. Marini F. Stevenson I. Frei C. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The STT4 gene was uncovered in a screen for mutants defective in the pathway upstream of the protein kinase, Pkc1p (28Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Stt4p apparently produces substrate for a PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase, Mss4p (29Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Hall M.N. J. Biol.

Wu W.I. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We investigated whether either PtdIns 4-kinase serves as the source of the PtdIns(4)P accumulated in the sec14-3 sac1-22 cells. The results presented here clearly implicate Pik1p in generating this pool of PtdIns(4)P and support a direct role for PtdIns(4)P in secretion.

Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) intoClaI- and KpnI-digested pRS426 (34Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). pHHYS14-5 (plasmid-borne SEC14) was derived from a genomic DNA clone in a URA3-marked multicopy (2-μm DNA-based) vector, pSEY18 (35Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This plasmid was isolated by complementation of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of CTY1-1A; restriction enzyme cleavage site mapping and amplification by the polymerase chain reaction with specific primers (GenePair; Research Genetics) confirmed the presence of the SEC14 gene. The plasmid was digested withSphI and re-ligated, which removed an 8-kilobase segment of the original 13-kilobase insert, yielding pHHYS14-5. Yeast cells were grown at 29 °C to A 600 nm = ∼0.8 in SC medium. The culture was resuspended in an equivalent amount of SC-low glucose medium (to induce expression of the SUC2 gene), split into two equal portions, one of which was incubated at 29 °C and the other at 37 °C for 1 h. The extracellular invertase activity and total cellular invertase activity were then measured as described in detail elsewhere (36Westphal V. Marcusson E.G. Winther J.R. Emr S.D. van den Hazel H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11865-11870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Secretion index was calculated as the ratio of the secreted activity to the total activity. Cells were pulse-labeled and chased as described in detail elsewhere (33Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown at 25 °C to mid-exponential phase and used to inoculate two separate cultures, which were incubated with shaking at 25 and 37 °C, respectively, for 10 min before addition of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (20 μCi/A 600 nm unit; Expre35S35S Label; NEN Life Science Products) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (final concentration). After addition of label, cells were incubated for 15 min, whereupon nonradioactive methionine (5 mm), cysteine (1 mm), and yeast extract (0.2%) were added at the indicated final concentrations. After the chase period (25 min), trichloroacetic acid was added (6% final concentration), and the samples were chilled on ice. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, dried in vacuo, and lysed. The cleared supernatant solution was removed to a fresh tube for immunoprecipitation of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), and mixed with rabbit polyclonal anti-CPY antibodies (gift of Scott Emr, University of California, San Diego, CA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker platform. After addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, bead-bound immune complexes were collected by brief centrifugation at 12,000 × g, and washed extensively as described earlier (33Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The samples were resuspended in SDS-urea sample buffer (1% SDS, 6m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), heated at 60–65 °C, and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide slab gel containing SDS and autoradiography. Yeast cells were labeled with 5 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (16.5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in SC medium for 16–20 h at 26 °C (20 ml each for CTY strains) or 29 °C (10 ml each for YES strains). When cultures reached mid-exponential phase (A 600 nm= ∼0.8), one-half of each culture was shifted to 37 °C for 1 h prior to termination of growth by addition of trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration). Extraction of lipids and their analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) were carried out as described in detail previously (19Stock S.D. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12979-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Hama H. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The observation that elevation of PtdIns(4)P overcomes the secretory defect of sec14-3 cells is consistent with a requirement for this lipid in efficient formation of Golgi-derived transport vesicles. If the primary role of Sec14p in secretion is to stimulate PtdIns(4)P production, then sec14-3 mutants should show a decrease in PtdIns(4)P levels at restrictive temperature. To test this prediction, we explored the effect of the sec14-3 mutation on PtdIns(4)P production by labeling the sec14-3 strain (CTY1-1A) and an otherwise isogenic SEC14 wild-type strain (CTY182) withmyo-[2-3H]inositol at both permissive and nonpermissive temperature and measuring the phosphoinositide levels in these cells (Fig. 1). At 26 °C, the amount of PtdIns(4)P in sec14-3 cells was equivalent to the level in SEC14cells, and the ratio of PtdIns(4)P to PtdIns(3)P was essentially identical to that in the normal cells. One hour after shift to restrictive temperature (37 °C), the level of PtdIns(4)P in wild-type cells decreased only slightly (25%) and the ratio of PtdIns(4)- to PtdIns(3)P was essentially unaffected. In contrast, in the mutant cells, the level of PtdIns(4)P fell by about 60% and the ratio of PtdIns(4)P to PtdIns(3)P also fell precipitously. No significant differences were observed between these strains in the relative levels of other phosphoinositides, including PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, at either temperature (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the conclusion that Sec14p function is required to maintain normal cellular levels of PtdIns(4)P. Because synthesis of PtdIns(4)P requires catalysis by a PtdIns 4-kinase, we examined the relationship between Sec14p function and the action of Pik1p and Stt4p. Yeast strains carrying the sec14-3 mutation exhibit defective growth and secretion at temperatures above 33 °C (12Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitken J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Fang M. Kearns B.G. Gedvilaite A. Kagiwada S. Kearns M. Fung M.K. Bankaitis V.A.

If the primary impairment in sec14-3 cells at restrictive temperature is the inability to deliver PtdIns for PtdIns(4)P production, then it might be anticipated that, at a temperature where Sec14p function is severely compromised (but not totally absent), overexpression of the responsible PtdIns 4-kinase might increase the rate of PtdIns(4)P production to a level sufficient to restore viability. To test this prediction, multicopy plasmids overexpressing either SEC14, PIK1,STT4, VPS34, or appropriate vector controls were introduced by transformation into a sec14-3 strain (CTY1-1A) or into an otherwise isogenic SEC14 strain (CTY182) and the ability of these transformants to grow on agar plates at different temperatures was assessed (Fig. 2). Wild-type cells carrying all of these plasmids grew readily at all temperatures tested. As expected, the sec14-3 strain carrying a control plasmid grew at 29 °C, but failed to grow at 34 °C or 37 °C; however, the mutant cells were able to grow at 34 °C and 37 °C when they carried plasmid-borne SEC14. Similarly, sec14-3 cells expressing PIK1 from a multicopy plasmid were able to grow reasonably well at 34 °C. Overexpression of the other PtdIns 4-kinase gene, STT4, or the PtdIns 3-kinase gene, VPS34, was unable to rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of sec14-3 cells, even at 34 °C (data not shown). The fact that Pik1p-mediated PtdIns(4)P production suppresses the growth defect of sec14-3 cells provides an independent demonstration that elevation of this lipid overcomes the secretory defect caused by sec14 deficiency. These findings also provide further support for the conclusion that PtdIns(4)P is important for some step required for protein transport from the Golgi. It has been demonstrated previously that, like SEC14, PIK1 is an essential gene (23Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). If the pool of PtdIns(4)P in Golgi membranes is supplied by Pik1p and is important for secretion, then cells carrying temperature-conditional pik1 alleles should show a reduction in PtdIns(4)P at restrictive temperature and should manifest a corresponding defect in secretion. As a prelude to labeling and phosphoinositide analysis, the growth properties of strains carrying two different pik1 ts alleles, YES95 (pik1-63) and YES102 (pik1-83), which were generated by random polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (26Hendricks K.B.

Biochemical and Genetic Analysis of a Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase (PIK1 Gene Product) in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph.D. thesis.

Regardless of the medium, bothpik1 ts mutants failed to grow above 34 °C, whereas the otherwise isogenic parental strain (YES32) grew well at all temperatures tested, but perhaps less robustly at the highest temperature examined (37 °C) (TableI). Addition of 1 m sorbitol to the medium improved the growth of the pik1 tsmutants only slightly, as observed for other pik1 tsalleles (27Garcia-Bustos J.F. Marini F. Stevenson I. Frei C. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2352-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Table ITemperature-sensitive growth of pik1 mutantsStrainAlleleTemperatureSC-TrpYPDYPD + 1m sorbitol°CYES32PIK130+++32+++34+++35+++37+/−+/−+YES95pik1-6330+++32+++34−/+−/++/−35−−+/−37−−−YES102pik1-8330+++32+++34−/+−/++/−35−−+/−37−−−Phenotype: +, wild-type growth; +/−, reduced growth rate; −/+, weak growth; −, no detectable growth.

These same strains were labeled withmyo-[2-3H]inositol, shifted from permissive (29 °C) to restrictive (37 °C) temperature for 1 h, and then lipids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as above (Fig.3). At permissive temperature, both mutant strains contained levels of PtdIns(4)P equivalent to or exceeding that observed in the wild-type control cells. After incubation at restrictive temperature for 1 h, the levels of PtdIns(4)P decreased substantially (by 60%) in both mutants, but not in the normal cells. These results demonstrate that inactivation of two different temperature-sensitive Pik1p derivatives causes the PtdIns(4)P pool to be depleted rather rapidly. Thus, Pik1p is responsible for production of a significant fraction of the cellular content of PtdIns(4)P. Presumably, at least some of the residual PtdIns(4)P present is supplied by Stt4p (24Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or is inaccessible to Sac1p (20Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol.

Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as observed in sec14 mutants (Fig. 1), reduction in PtdIns(4)P level correlates with the inability of pik1 ts cells to grow at restrictive temperature. A standard assay for secretory proficiency in S. cerevisiae is release of the extracellular enzyme, invertase (SUC2 gene product) (6Novick P. Field C. Schekman R.

Therefore, the amount of invertase secreted bypik1 ts mutants was measured at permissive temperature and after a shift to restrictive temperature for 1 h, under which conditions the mutants displayed a pronounced decrease in PtdIns(4)P level (Fig. 3).

In addition, the gene encoding another siglec-like sequence, OBBP-like protein, has been reported (8Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Diamandis E.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar), but there is no information on the potential sialic acid binding properties of this protein. The extracellular regions of siglecs are made up of an N-terminal V-set Ig-like domain followed by varying numbers of C2-set Ig-like domains, ranging from 1 in CD33 to 16 in sialoadhesin. Apart from myelin-associated glycoprotein, which is found exclusively in the nervous system, siglecs are generally expressed in a cell type-restricted manner on cells of the hemopoietic and immune systems. Thus, sialoadhesin is a macrophage-restricted adhesion molecule (9Crocker P.R. Freeman S. Gordon S. Kelm S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 635-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CD22 is found on B cells (10Dorken B. Moldenhauer G. Pezzutto A. Schwartz R. Feller A. Kiesel S. Nadler L. J.

These restricted expression patterns imply highly specific functions, as illustrated by extensive studies on CD22, a negative regulator of B cell activation (reviewed in Ref. 12Cyster J.G.

The common theme of sialic acid recognition suggests that carbohydrate binding is likely to be important in the biological functions of these molecules. Where studied, each siglec has a particular preference for both the nature of the sialic acid (14Kelm S. Schauer R. Manuguerra J.C. Gross H.J. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj.

A conserved arginine on the F-strand has been shown by x-ray crystallography to form a salt bridge with the carboxylate of sialic acid (18May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol.

All siglecs so far characterized also have an unusual arrangement of conserved cysteine residues in the V-set and adjacent C2-set domains. These are predicted to result in the formation of an intrasheet disulfide bond in the V-set domain and an interdomain disulfide (18May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although siglecs are able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding as isolated proteins, there are major differences in their binding activities when expressed on plasma membranes (3Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R.

Varki A. Powell L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7533-7542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This could be due, at least in part, to the occupation of their ligand binding sites by sialic acids present in the glycocalyx. With CD33, no binding is detectable in transfected COS cells, but following sialidase treatment of the cells, high levels of binding can be demonstrated (3Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, sialoadhesin can mediate strong sialic acid-dependent binding on both transfected cells (1Crocker P.R. Mucklow S. Bouckson V. McWilliam A. Willis A.C. Gordon S. Milon G. Kelm S. Bradfield P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4490-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and on macrophages that naturally express the receptor (9Crocker P.R. Freeman S. Gordon S. Kelm S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 635-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because sialoadhesin contains 17 Ig-like domains compared with only two in CD33, one possibility is that the sialic acid binding site in sialoadhesin extends away from the plasma membrane, thereby promoting cell-cell interactions. In this paper, we describe the properties of a new member of the siglec family, siglec-7. Siglec-7 is the first example of a siglec to be found predominantly on natural killer (NK) cells. It is also unusual compared with other siglecs in being able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding on non-sialidase-treated transfectants, strongly suggestive of a role in cell-cell interactions. Finally, the presence of immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM)-like motifs in the cytoplasmic tail suggests that it may be involved in regulating NK cell activation events.

Phycoerythrin-conjugated mAbs against the following human CD antigens were purchased from Serotec (Kidlington, United Kingdom): CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19, and CD56. PC5-conjugated anti-CD56 (Immunotech, Marseille, France) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mAbs against CD45RO (Dako, Cambridge, United Kingdom), CD45RA (Immunotech), CD38 (Dako), and CD16 (Serotec) were used in triple labeling experiments. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Fab2 anti-mouse IgG were from Dako and goat anti-mouse phycoerythrin was from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Using the amino acid sequence of CD33, a specific homology search was performed against a data base containing more than one million expression sequence tags obtained from over 700 different cDNA libraries. Several clones corresponding to the same CD33-like cDNA were identified in cDNA libraries from the following sources: placenta, breast cancer, spleen, human primary breast cancer, human primary dendritic cell, human gall bladder, apoptotic T-cell, spleen, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. One of these, HDPUW68, in the pSPORT mammalian expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), was isolated from a human primary dendritic cell cDNA library and found to contain a full-length cDNA. The predicted amino acid sequence encoded by HDPUW68 is referred to as siglec-7 from here on. A computer search of nucleotide and protein sequence was carried out on June 24, 1999, using the Blast GeneSearch (NCBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Manipulations of sequences and alignments were performed using Baylor College of Medicine molecular biology software (available on the Internet) (Human Genome Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Metaphase spreads prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes were hybridized with a biotinylated insert from HDPUW68 as described (26Ollendorff V. Mattei M. Fournier E. Adelaide J.

The following cell lines were provided by the ICRF Cell Production Service: COS-1, Balb/c 3T3 A31, Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO), KG1b, HL-60, U937, and Daudi. The NK-like cell lines, YT and NKL, were obtained from Dr. Gillian Griffiths (Oxford University) and Dr. Jerome Ritz (Harvard Medical School) respectively. CHO cells stably expressing full-length sialoadhesin (Sn-CHO) were obtained as described (27Hashimoto Y. Suzuki M. Crocker P.R. Suzuki A. J. Biochem.

COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, and all other cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5 or 10% fetal calf serum. Human red blood cells (RBCs) were obtained from healthy donors and stored at 4 °C in Alsever's solution for up to 2 weeks. Human blood leukocytes were obtained from whole blood by dextran sedimentation followed by lysis of contaminating RBCs. Mononuclear fractions for flow cytometry were obtained by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Balb/c 3T3 A31 cells were co-transfected, by electroporation, with a 10:1 ratio of HDPUW68 and pcDNA3. G418-resistant clones expressing siglec-7 were identified by their ability to bind human RBCs and designated siglec-7–3T3. Balb/c mice were immunized twice, intraperitoneally, at an interval of 14 days, with 107 live siglec-7–3T3 cells. One of the mice was boosted with 107 live cells, 4 days prior to the fusion of spleen cells with the SP2 myeloma, and hybridomas were generated following standard methods (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A positive well, reacting with siglec-7–3T3 cells, was cloned three times by limiting dilution, and the mAb was designated S7 (IgG1). S7 was used either as tissue culture supernatant or following purification with protein A-Sepharose. CHO cells stably expressing siglec-7 were generated by cotransfection of CHO cells with a 10:1 ratio of HDPUW68 and pcDNA3. G418 resistant clones expressing siglec-7 were identified by their ability to bind anti-siglec-7 mAbs and designated siglec-7-CHO. For binding assays, siglec-7-CHO, Sn-CHO, and wild-type CHO cells were plated overnight at 5 × 104 cells/well on 24 well plates. RBCs were washed three times in PBS containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin (PBA), resuspended at 0.25% (v/v) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 ml of the cell suspension was added to the wells. After 60 min at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were removed by three gentle washes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% PBA, and RBC rosetting was quantified by measuring the pseudoperoxidase activity of hemoglobin as described (4Kelm S.

The COS cells were detached with PBS + 5 mm EDTA and either left untreated or treated with 0.05 units/ml sialidase for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with saturating concentrations (20 μg/ml) of 2,3-PAA or 2,6-PAA for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBA, and incubated with125I-streptavidin diluted in PBA to 0.5 μCi/ml for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBA, bound radioactivity was counted using a Beckman gamma counter. FACS analysis was carried out in parallel to determine the percentage of COS cells expressing each molecule. Single, double, and triple labeling were performed following standard protocols (30Kantor A.B. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. II. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1997: 49.1-49.13Google Scholar). Following staining, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACS analyzer. Wild-type CHO cells or CHO cells expressing siglec-7 at 2 × 107/ml were labeled with TRANS35S-LABELTM at 0.2 mCi/ml, and lysates were prepared in 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitations were carried out following standard procedures (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), and precipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. HDPUW68, a clone derived from a human primary dendritic cell cDNA library, was identified as an EST sharing a high degree of sequence similarity with human CD33 cDNA. Examination of its full-length sequence of 1748 base pairs revealed a single long open reading frame encoding a type 1 membrane protein of 467 amino acids belonging to the Ig superfamily. Based on its sequence similarity with other siglecs and its ability to bind sialic acid (see below), this protein has been designated siglec-7 (Fig. 1). The extracellular region of siglec-7 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide and three Ig-like domains that are made up of an N-terminal V-set domain and two C2-set domains. There are eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Following the transmembrane region, there is a cytoplasmic tail of 91 amino acids. Examination of the first two domains at the N terminus of siglec-7 revealed the presence of the characteristic structural features of the siglec subgroup of Ig superfamily proteins (Fig. 1). There is precise conservation of the unusual pattern of cysteines found in these proteins (18May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and the key amino acids involved in sialic acid binding, in particular the critical arginine at position 124 and the two conserved aromatic residues at positions 26 and 134 on the A and G strands of the V-set domain (18May A.P.

These are tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively, in siglec-7 (Fig. 1). In data base searches, the closest matches were as follows, in rank order: OBBP-like protein (8Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Diamandis E.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar), CD33 (31Simmons D.L. Seed B. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2797-2800PubMed Google Scholar), OBBP-1/siglec-6 (6Patel N.

Significant similarities were also found in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails, especially within two well conserved regions in the cytoplasmic tail, centered in both cases around tyrosine residues (Fig. 1). In siglec-7, the membrane proximal region (IQYAPL) conforms to the consensus ITIM ((I/L/V)XYXX(L/V)) defined in several other leukocyte proteins (reviewed in Ref. 32Gergely J. Pecht I. Sarmay G. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas the membrane-distal motif (NEYSEI) does not conform but is similar to the membrane-distal ITIM-like motif characterized in certain other leukocyte receptors (33Hua C.T.

The gene encoding siglec-7 was mapped by in situhybridization to the long arm of chromosome 19, in the 19q13.3 band (Fig. 2 A), closely linked to the CD33, siglec-6, siglec-5, and OBBP-like genes (5Cornish A.L.

Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B) revealed the presence of a major siglec-7 mRNA transcript of 2.0 kilobases, with the highest levels in placenta, liver, lung, and spleen. High levels were also detected in extracts of peripheral blood leukocytes, but low or undetectable levels were present in other tissues examined (Fig.2 B). To investigate the sialic acid binding properties of siglec-7, we initially performed binding assays in which human RBCs were added to transiently transfected COS cells. High levels of binding were observed with native RBCs, and binding was abolished when the RBCs were pretreated with sialidase, demonstrating that the binding was sialic acid-dependent (data not shown). To determine the sialic acid linkage preference of siglec-7, binding assays were carried out with polyacrylamide conjugates, carrying either 3′ or 6′ sialyllactose or lactose. In these experiments, COS cells were transiently transfected with siglec-7, sialoadhesin, CD22, siglec-5, or CR1 as a negative control. FACS analysis showed that 20–30% of the cells expressed each molecule 3 days after the transfection (data not shown). Transfected cells were either untreated or treated with sialidase immediately before the binding assay to remove potentially inhibitory sialic acids in the COS cell glycocalyx (Fig.3). With sialidase-treated COS cells, the properties of siglec-7 were more similar to those of siglec-5, binding glycoconjugates carrying sialic acid in either α2,3 or α2,6 linkages. In contrast, sialoadhesin and CD22 exhibited a clear preference for α2,3 or α2,6-linked sialoglycoconjugates, respectively (Fig. 3). Interestingly, siglec-7 also bound strongly to the glycoconjugates in the absence of COS cell pretreatment with sialidase, unlike sialoadhesin and siglec-5, which showed greatly increased binding following the treatment. The high levels of binding seen with CD22 on untreated COS cells is likely to be due to the absence from COS cells of ST6Gal1, a glycosyltransferase required to make CD22 ligands (36Hennet T. Chui D. Paulson J.C. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4504-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). No specific binding was observed when lactose-PAA was used as a negative control. The high constitutive binding of siglec-7 to sialylated ligands was further investigated. CHO cells stably expressing siglec-7 bound RBCs at high levels either with or without pretreatment of the CHO cells with sialidase (data not shown). In contrast, RBC binding to sialoadhesin-expressing CHO cells was greatly increased by sialidase pretreatment of the CHO cells (data not shown). Using S7, a mAb prepared to siglec-7, detailed analysis of the expression of the molecule was carried out by FACS analysis, using human peripheral blood leukocytes. First, expression on granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte subsets was compared (Fig.4 A), revealing weak expression on granulocytes, intermediate expression on monocytes, and high expression on a subpopulation of lymphocytes. To characterize the lymphocyte-reactive cells in more detail, double labeling was carried out in which staining for siglec-7 was combined with staining for CD3 (pan T cell), CD4 and CD8 (T cell subsets), CD19 (pan B cell), and CD56 (NK cells) (Fig. 4 B). The dominant populations expressing siglec-7 were CD56+ cells, with a small subset of CD3+CD8+ T cells also binding antibody. The proportion of CD56+ cells expressing siglec-7 varied between individuals and within the same individual over time. However, there was consistently a difference in expression between CD56-high cells (a small population of NK cells) of which a high proportion were positive for siglec-7 (mean, 78%; range, 60–92%) and CD56-mid cells (a much larger population), of which an average of 65% were positive (range, 52–85%). The CD8 cells that were siglec-7+ fell mainly into the CD8-mid range and were predominantly CD56+NK cells (not shown). Only a very small proportion of the CD8-high cells"

We isolated a nuclear factor (designated ASC-2) with such properties by using the ligand-binding domain of retinoid X receptor as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening. ASC-2 also interacted with other nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, estrogen receptor α, and glucocorticoid receptor, basal factors TFIIA and TBP, and transcription integrators CBP/p300 and SRC-1. In transient cotransfections, ASC-2, either alone or in conjunction with CBP/p300 and SRC-1, stimulated ligand-dependent transactivation by wild type nuclear receptors but not mutant receptors lacking the AF2 domain. Consistent with an idea that ASC-2 is essential for the nuclear receptor function in vivo, microinjection of anti-ASC-2 antibody abrogated the ligand-dependent transactivation of retinoic acid receptor, and this repression was fully relieved by coinjection of ASC-2-expression vector. Surprisingly, ASC-2 was identical to a gene previously identified during a search for genes amplified and overexpressed in breast and other human cancers. From these results, we concluded that ASC-2 is a bona fidetranscription coactivator molecule of nuclear receptors, and its altered expression may contribute to the development of cancers.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar). The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3,1 and retinoids as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (reviewed in Ref. 2Lee Y. Tzameli I. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 31: 1-8Google Scholar). Functional analysis of nuclear receptors has shown that there are two major activation domains. The activation function-2 (AF-2) at the extreme C-terminal region of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) exhibits ligand-dependent transactivation, whereas the N-terminal activation function-1 contains a ligand-independent transactivation domain. The AF-2 region is conserved among nuclear receptors, and deletion or point mutations in this region impair transcriptional activation without changing ligand and DNA binding affinities. X-ray crystallographic studies of the LBD of nuclear receptors revealed that the ligand binding induces a major conformational change in the AF-2 region (3Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

As expected, many coactivators fail to interact with AF-2 mutants of nuclear receptors (8Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of most nuclear receptors involves at least two separate processes as follows: derepression and activation. Repression is mediated in part by interaction of unliganded receptors with corepressors such as N-CoR (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar) and SMRT (12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). However, ligand binding triggers dissociation of these corepressors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Transcription coactivators bridge transcription factors and the components of the basal transcriptional apparatus. In particular, the functionally conserved proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (reviewed in Ref. 13Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm.

Based on this broad spectrum of action, these proteins (i.e. CBP/p300 and SRC-1) were termed transcription integrators. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors has been postulated to involve targeted changes in chromatin structure (33Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M.

Genomic instability in human cancers commonly results in gene amplification and the consequent overexpression of specific genes. Breast cancers frequently exhibit increased copy number of chromosomal segments that encode genes related to tumor growth such asERBB-2, MYC, and cyclin D1 (47Courjal F. Cuny M. Simony-Lafontaine J. Louason G. Speiser P. Zeillinger R. Rodriguez C. Theillet C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4360-4367PubMed Google Scholar). The application of molecular cytogenetic technology to breast cancers has identified several regions of increased DNA copy number whose target genes remain unknown (48Guan X.Y. Meltzer P.S. Dalton W.S. Trent J.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 49Tirkkonen M. Tanner M. Karhu R. Kallioniemi A. Isola J. Kallioniemi O.P. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 21: 77-184Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In order to isolate candidate genes from one of these regions (20q), chromosome microdissection and hybrid selections were used to clone amplified cDNAs. In particular, three novel amplified genes of potential biological relevance to cancer progression (termedAIB1, AIB3, and AIB4) have been isolated from a cDNA library constructed from the 20q amplified breast cancer cell line BT-474 (50Guan X.Y. Xu J. Anzick S.L. Zhang H. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3446-3450PubMed Google Scholar). These genes were mapped to 20q11 (AIB3 andAIB4) and 20q12 (AIB1) by fluorescence in situ hybridization. AIB1 was subsequently shown to be a member of the SRC-1 family and a coactivator of ERα (51Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the isolation of a novel nuclear protein-activating signal cointegrator 2 (ASC-2) based on its interaction with retinoid X receptor (RXR) which on sequence analysis is identical to AIB3. Consistent with specific interactions with basal factors TFIIA and TBP, ASC-2 exhibits an autonomous transactivation function in yeast. ASC-2 also interacts with transcription integrators SRC-1 and CBP and stimulates transactivation by nuclear receptors in conjunction with these proteins. Remarkably, microinjection of anti-ASC-2 antibody blocks the ligand-dependent transactivation of nuclear receptors, and this repression is fully relieved by coinjection of ASC-2-expression vector. Thus, ASC-2 is a novel transcriptional coactivator molecule required for the ligand-dependent transactivation of nuclear receptors in vivo, and its altered expression may contribute to the development of cancers. Estrogen, T3, and 9-cis-RA were obtained from Sigma. Y190 cells and a parental vector pAS2–1 are as described (CLONTECH). A chimeric protein consisting of Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) fused to the LBD of human RXRα was constructed by using PCR (Gal4-DBD/RXR-LBD). EGY48 cells, the LexA-β-galactosidase reporter construct, the LexA and B42 parental vectors were as reported (52Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol.

Gal4-DBD/RXR-LBD was used as bait to screen aXenopus oocyte cDNA library in pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) for RXR-interacting proteins, according to the manufacturer's protocols. However, the screening was executed either in the presence or absence of 1 μm9-cis-RA as described (52Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The library plasmids from positive clones that expressed both HIS3 and lacZreporters were rescued and retransformed into yeast cells, together with the original or other bait constructs, to test specificity of the interactions. The cotransformation and β-galactosidase assays in yeast were performed as described (52Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each experiment, at least three independently derived colonies expressing chimeric receptors were tested. The GST fusions or GST alone was expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with labeled proteins expressed by in vitrotranslation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described (56Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). CV-1 or HeLa cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum. After 24 h incubation, cells were transfected with 100 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of an indicated reporter gene, along with hRXRα-, ERα, ERαΔAF2, RXRΔAF-, ASC-2-, SRC-1-, or p300-expression vectors. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of the CDM8 expression vector (i.e. pcDNA3) to transfections. Twelve hours later, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After 12 h, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 0.1 μm ligand. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase activity was assayed as described (57****Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to the β-galactosidase expression. Consistent results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. AIB3-specific oligonucleotide primers, G3F1 (TTTATTCACTGGTCCATTTCTACA) and G3R2 (AGTTTTCACATTTCCTAAGC), were used to screen a human genomic BAC library (Research Genetics). A positive BAC clone was labeled with Spectrum Orange-dUTP (Vysis) using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.), purified through a Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and ethanol-precipitated.

For FISH analysis of tumors, array sections were deparaffinized, air-dried, and dehydrated in an ethanol series followed by denaturation for 4 min at 72 °C in 70% formamide, 2× SSC. The hybridization mixture contained 200 ng of probe and 15 μg of COT1 DNA and was incubated overnight. Slides were washed and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in antifade. Images were captured with a non-laser confocal fluorescence optical module (CARV optical module, Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) connected to an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For cell lines, the modal ASC-2 copy number was determined in counts of 50 nuclei. Tumors were scored in three groups according to the number of ASC-2 signals observed: low (≤4), moderate (4Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L.

Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using the RNeasy Midi RNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA, size-fractionated on a 1% agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS buffer, was transferred to Hybond N+ Nylon membrane in 10× SSC. Gel purified probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The Northern blot was probed sequentially with a 4.2-kilobase pair fragment of the ASC-2 cDNA and β-actin (CLONTECH). Hybridization intensities were measured on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, CA), and the relative gene expression was normalized to the β-actin signal. The nuclear receptor-binding domain of ASC-2 (i.e. the ASC-2 residues 719–860) was expressed and used as an antigen to raise a polyclonal rabbit antibody, which was affinity purified using standard procedures (60****Google Scholar).

To understand the possible role of extra-nuclear ATM, we initially investigated the nature of these vesicles. In this report we demonstrate that a portion of ATM co-localizes with catalase, that ATM is present in purified mouse peroxisomes, and that there are reduced levels of ATM in the post-mitochondrial membrane fraction of cells from a patient with a peroxisome biogenesis disorder. Furthermore the use of the yeast two-hybrid system demonstrated that ATM interacts directly with a protein involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome matrix. Because peroxisomes are major sites of oxidative metabolism, we investigated catalase activity and lipid hydroperoxide levels in normal and A-T fibroblasts. Significantly decreased catalase activity and increased lipid peroxidation was observed in several A-T cell lines.

However, the neurological symptoms are difficult to explain in terms of defective DNA damage response. Using immunoelectron microscopy we showed labeling of ATM antibodies in cytoplasmic vesicles of varying sizes (60–230 nm) in both fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells (24Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The heterogeneous size of the vesicles labeled with ATM antibodies and the punctate immunofluorescence was suggestive of peroxisomes (24Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles present in virtually all eukaryotic cells. They contain a range of enzymes involved in a variety of metabolic processes including peroxide-based respiration, oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, and synthesis of plasmalogens and bile acids. The majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported into the peroxisome via a noncleavable peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1), which consists of a tripeptide SKL or conserved variant at the extreme C terminus (26Subramani S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 445-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In this report we show that ATM co-localizes with the peroxisomal matrix protein catalase and binds the PTS1 receptor. The presence of ATM in peroxisomes may provide an explanation for some of the pleiotropic symptoms of A-T.DISCUSSIONOur previous studies on the localization of ATM indicated that a proportion of the protein is localized outside the nucleus in vesicular structures (24Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Using several different independent techniques and different anti-ATM antibodies, this study has shown that ATM is present in peroxisomes. We further demonstrated binding of the C-terminal half of ATM to Pex5p, the receptor for proteins containing a PTS1 signal. In addition we showed that ATM is markedly reduced in the post-mitochondrial pellet of GM13267 cells, which have a defect in the import of proteins into peroxisomes. The nuclear and peroxisomal forms of ATM appear to be identical in as far as the C terminus is concerned, because both are recognized by the monoclonal anti-C-terminal peptide antibody, CT-1. The mechanisms that determine the distribution of ATM between the nucleus and peroxisomes are presently unknown, and in addition there is no obvious nuclear localization signal in the protein. Determination of the exact peroxisomal targeting signal must also await detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies. In this regard, although catalase has been shown to bind to the PTS1 receptor (Ref. 32Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholarand this study), a recent report indicates that the import of catalase is more complex (35Sheikh F.G. Pahan K. Khan M. Barbosa E. Singh I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that ATM also binds the PTS1 receptor, we have not yet demonstrated that ATM is internalized in the peroxisomal matrix. It may be bound to the peroxisome membrane.As pointed out by Rotman and Shiloh (36Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence suggest that the hypersensitivity of A-T cells to ionizing radiation may not result solely from defective cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage processing. The constitutive activation of several IR-responsive signaling pathways in unirradiated A-T cells, which resembles but does not achieve the same extent as that in irradiated control cells, indicates that these cells are in a state of continuous oxidative stress. In addition, red blood cells from A-T heterozygotes have been reported to contain a lower content of sulfhydryl groups, increased membrane fluidity and increased lipid peroxidation (37Rybczynska M. Pawlak A.L. Sihorska W. Ignatowicz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated decreased levels of catalase and increased levels of lipid hydroperoxides in several A-T cell lines. The major mechanisms for disposal of hydrogen peroxide are catalase and glutathione peroxidase, both of which occur in peroxisomes as well as in the cytoplasm. The continuous state of oxidative stress in A-T could be explained by a deficiency in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species, and this may result from the decreased catalase activity observed here. Intriguingly, catalase activity in the livers ofatm −/− is not statistically different to normal (data not shown), suggesting fundamental differences between mice and humans or different tissues in response to lack of peroxisomal ATM. This may be significant in terms of the much less severe neurodegeneration seen inatm −/− mice (38Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T.

Kirsch D.G. Canman C.E. Ahn J.-H. Ziv Y. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10146-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and ATM binds in vitro to the neuronal homologue of β-adaptin, β-neuronal adaptin-like protein. Because it has been suggested that β-NAP plays an essential role in synaptic vesicle transport in neuronal cells, the absence of ATM from these vesicles could also contribute to neuronal degeneration. Indeed there is evidence that defects in synaptic vesicle transport give rise to ataxia in humans (42Newman L.S. McKeever M.O. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Cell. 1995; 82: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to suggest that the function of the noncatalase vesicles and peroxisomes may be interrelated, in that components of the peroxisome importation machinery (peroxins) have been localized to vesicles distinct from mature peroxisomes (43Faber K.N. Heyman J.A. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the endoplasmic reticulum plays an essential role in peroxisome biogenesis (44Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 231-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Many of the features of A-T, for example defects in cell cycle checkpoints and aberrant meiosis, are consistent with the nuclear localization of ATM. However, an explanation for the basis of the most debilitating and characteristic symptoms of the disease, the neurological dysfunction, has so far been elusive. Some peroxisome biogenesis disorders show similarity with A-T, for example, ataxia that occurs in infantile Refsum's disease (45Jansen G.A. Ofman R. Ferdinandusse S. Ijlst L. Muijsers A.O. Skjeldal O.H. Stokke O. Jakobs C. Besley G.T. Wraith J.E. Wanders R.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and demyelination, which occurs in X-linked adrenoleukodystropy (46Gartner J. Braun A. Holzinger A. Roerig P. Lenard H.G. Roscher A.A. Neuropediatrics. 1998; 29: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ATM is found predominantly outside the nucleus in Purkinje cells (47Oka A. Takashima S. Neurosci Lett. 1998; 252: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 2S. Lee and D. Watters, unpublished observations. Thus in noncycling cells the primary function of ATM would be in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In summary, we have demonstrated that ATM is associated with peroxisomes, which provides a new direction for investigating the role of ATM. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)1 is a rare human autosomal recessive multisystem disease that is characterized by a wide range of features including, progressive cerebellar ataxia with onset during infancy, occulocutaneous telangiectasia, susceptibility to bronchopulmonary disease and neoplasia, occulomotor disturbances, progeric hair and skin changes, clinical and cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation, chromosomal instability, and growth and developmental abnormalities (1Sedgwick R.P.

Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The gene mutated in A-T (ATM forataxia-telangiectasia mutated) was cloned and shown to code for a protein of 350 kDa belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family (3Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. et al.Science. 1995; 268: 1700-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). Within this family, ATM is most closely related to a group of proteins involved in maintaining the integrity of DNA and/or cell cycle control in response to DNA damage. These include mammalian DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), Tel1p, and MEC1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad3p, from Saccharomyces pombe, and MEI-41 fromDrosophila melanogaster (4Savitsky K.

Watters D. Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 382-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Like DNA-PK, ATM does not appear to be a lipid kinase but rather functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase (6Jung M. Kondratyev A. Lee S.A. Dimtchev A. Dritschilo A.

Pawlak A.L. Sihorska W. Ignatowicz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated decreased levels of catalase and increased levels of lipid hydroperoxides in several A-T cell lines. The major mechanisms for disposal of hydrogen peroxide are catalase and glutathione peroxidase, both of which occur in peroxisomes as well as in the cytoplasm. The continuous state of oxidative stress in A-T could be explained by a deficiency in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species, and this may result from the decreased catalase activity observed here. Intriguingly, catalase activity in the livers ofatm −/− is not statistically different to normal (data not shown), suggesting fundamental differences between mice and humans or different tissues in response to lack of peroxisomal ATM. This may be significant in terms of the much less severe neurodegeneration seen inatm −/− mice (38Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T.

It should be pointed out that ATM is also present on nonperoxisomal vesicles co-localizing with β-adaptin (29Lim D.-S. Kirsch D.G. Canman C.E. Ahn J.-H. Ziv Y. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10146-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and ATM binds in vitro to the neuronal homologue of β-adaptin, β-neuronal adaptin-like protein. Because it has been suggested that β-NAP plays an essential role in synaptic vesicle transport in neuronal cells, the absence of ATM from these vesicles could also contribute to neuronal degeneration. Indeed there is evidence that defects in synaptic vesicle transport give rise to ataxia in humans (42Newman L.S. McKeever M.O. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Cell. 1995; 82: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to suggest that the function of the noncatalase vesicles and peroxisomes may be interrelated, in that components of the peroxisome importation machinery (peroxins) have been localized to vesicles distinct from mature peroxisomes (43Faber K.N. Heyman J.A. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the endoplasmic reticulum plays an essential role in peroxisome biogenesis (44Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 231-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Many of the features of A-T, for example defects in cell cycle checkpoints and aberrant meiosis, are consistent with the nuclear localization of ATM. However, an explanation for the basis of the most debilitating and characteristic symptoms of the disease, the neurological dysfunction, has so far been elusive. Some peroxisome biogenesis disorders show similarity with A-T, for example, ataxia that occurs in infantile Refsum's disease (45Jansen G.A. Ofman R. Ferdinandusse S. Ijlst L. Muijsers A.O.

Roscher A.A. Neuropediatrics. 1998; 29: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ATM is found predominantly outside the nucleus in Purkinje cells (47Oka A. Takashima S. Neurosci Lett. 1998; 252: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 2S. Lee and D. Watters, unpublished observations. Thus in noncycling cells the primary function of ATM would be in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In summary, we have demonstrated that ATM is associated with peroxisomes, which provides a new direction for investigating the role of ATM.

This critical G1 checkpoint, known as the restriction or R point (1Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 256: 603-608Crossref Scopus (1848) Google Scholar), separates the cell cycle into an early mitogen-dependent period and a subsequent primarily autonomous phase leading to cellular division (2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). Determining the mechanisms regulating passage through the R point is important to the understanding of diverse cellular processes including cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest allowing for DNA repair, terminal differentiation, and apoptosis (2Weinberg R.A.

The precise regulation of early G1 phase events is mediated by the G1 phase cyclins and their inhibitors together with their substrates, including the retinoblastoma (pRB)1 tumor suppressor protein. Phosphorylation and inactivation of pRB is conveyed by serine/threonine kinase holoenzymes, composed of a regulatory G1 cyclin of the D family and its associated catalytic subunit Cdk4 or Cdk6 (2Weinberg R.A.

Immunoneutralizing and antisense experiments have demonstrated cyclin D1 abundance conveys a rate-limiting role in promoting progression through the early G1 phase induced by serum addition, growth factors, and mitogens such as estrogen (5Resnitzky D.

Thus cyclin D1 accelerates transit through G1 but inhibits S phase traversal when moderately up-regulated (5Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell.

It was proposed that the inhibition of cyclin D1 protein levels by E1A represented a function evolved by E1A to overcome the G1/S checkpoint function of cyclin D1 that blocks unregulated S-phase entry and apoptosis (29Spitkovsky D.

It was not known whether the cyclin D1 gene was a direct transcriptional target of E1A nor were the mechanisms by which E1A regulated cyclin D1 transcription known.The mechanisms by which p300/CBP and histone acetyltransferase activity modulate the cell cycle regulatory apparatus are complex. Microinjection of p300/CBP antibodies blocked transcription of immediate early genes that have been strongly implicated in mitogenic signaling (39Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Recent studies in which the murine p300 andcbp genes were deleted demonstrated an important role for p300 in development and the enhancement of cellular proliferation (40Yao T.-P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.-D. Ch'ng L.-E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The embryos of p300-deficient mice displayed reduced bromodeoxyuridine uptake, and the embryonic fibroblasts derived from the mice (MEFs) showed a markedly reduced proliferation rate (40Yao T.-P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.-D. Ch'ng L.-E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Ribozyme ablation of p300 or CBP demonstrated distinct roles for p300 and CBP in cell cycle control and differentiation and suggested a requirement for p300 in cellular proliferation (41Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.-P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the identification of direct transcriptional targets of p300/CBP involved in cell cycle progression would be critical for understanding p300/CBP function in different cell types.In the current studies, the amino-terminal p300/CBP binding domain of E1A was required for repression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, but E1A induced cyclin A. p300, but not CBP, directly augmented cyclin D1 promoter activity and protein abundance through an AP-1-dependent mechanism. The region of p300 that bound c-Jun/c-Fos was required for induction of cyclin D1. The overexpression of either cyclin D1 or p300 inhibited apoptosis; however, the ability of p300 to affect apoptosis was abolished in cells derived from mice homozygously deleted of the cyclin D1 gene. These findings indicate that the induction of the cyclin D1 gene by p300 may play an important role in the inhibition of cellular apoptosis.DISCUSSIONThe p300 gene encodes a co-activator protein with partial functional redundancy based on genetic analysis. The orthologue CBP and co-activator proteins of the p160 SRC family contribute co-activator function and target overlapping genetic and transcription factor targets. The molecular mechanisms by which p300 regulates specific components of the cell cycle remained to be determined. As p300 can inhibit cellular proliferation in a cell type-specific manner, analysis of the interface between co-activators and specific target genes will be complex. In the current study, p300 induced cyclin D1; however, CBP, although capable of inducing RAR-reporter activity, failed to induce cyclin D1. This finding is consistent with recent studies in which p300 and CBP induced distinct transcriptional targets in the same cell type (41Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.-P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). CBP induced p27Kip1 and p300 induced p21Cip1 in F9 cells (41Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.-P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The findings that p300 induced cyclin D1 through DNA sequences that bind c-Jun/c-Fos together with p300, rather than other candidate transcription factor binding sites in the promoter, indicate specificity in the signal transduction pathways by which p300 regulates a specific target gene. p300, together with c-Jun and c-Fos, formed part of the cyclin D1 promoter DNA-bound nuclear protein complex at −953. p300 augments the activity of c-Jun and c-Fos (75Bannister A.J.

In the current studies the c-Jun dominant negative, TAM-67, reduced p300-induced activity of the cyclin D1 promoter. cyclin D1 promoter activity was induced by c-Jun through the −953 region in JEG-3 cells (10Albanese C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), cyclin D1 was identified as both a direct transcriptional target and an important component of an immediate early gene-induced signaling cascade. Homozygous deletion of either the cyclin D1 gene (21Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A.

Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) is consistent with a role for c-Jun in the inhibition of cellular apoptosis. Selective deletion of the c-Jun phosphorylation sites serine 63 and 73 in transgenic mice resulted in mice resistant to kainate seizure induced neuronal apoptosis (73Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The induction of c-Jun abundance and phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK at serine 63 and 73 in response to UV irradiation is thought to represent an important component of the protective response to inhibit UV-induced apoptosis (78Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). The apoptosis rates after UV irradiation were increased up to 100% in the cyclin D1 −/−MEFs compared with cyclin D1+/+ on several different substrates (type 1 collagen monomer, laminin, and 0.5% gelatin). cyclin D1 is induced both by c-Jun directly (10Albanese C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) and in a JNK-dependent manner in response to oncogenic pp60v-src (18Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines III, G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S. Davis R.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Future studies will determine the role for cyclin D1 overexpression in resistance to apoptosis induced by other agents, such as chemotherapeutics; however, the inhibition of apoptosis by cyclin D1 may contribute to aberrant survival and oncogene-induced tumorigenesis.The CH3 region of p300 can play a role in recruitment of P/CAF and its associated histone acetylase activity. Acetylation of histones is associated with gene activation, and several transcription co-activators/adaptors convey histone acetyltransferase activity, including Gcn5 family members (hGcn5, P/CAF), CBP/p300, and TAFII250 (79Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support a role for histone acetyltransferase activity conveyed by these proteins in cell cycle regulatory events. P/CAF overexpression, however, did not induce cyclin D1 in JEG-3 cells (data not shown), suggesting the formation of distinct multimeric complexes at the CH3 domain may convey separate functional activities. Because P/CAF can inhibit cell cycle progression (80Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-I. Howard B.H. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), the ability of p300 to recruit distinct complexes to a common region may be critical in determining its cell cycle effects. Although CBP did not induce cyclin D1, consistent with the ability of p300 and CBP to regulate distinct target genes through distinct transcription factors (40Yao T.-P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.-D. Ch'ng L.-E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 75Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), other co-activators may enhance cyclin D1 abundance in other cell types. For example cyclin D1 promoter activity is induced by activity of the TAFII250 subunit of the basal transcription complex TFIID (81Suzuki-Yagawa Y. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells expressing mutants of TAFII250 are defective in their rate of G1phase progression, and cells expressing Gcn5 mutants defective in histone acetyltransferase activity have a proliferative defect (82Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Efficient transformation by E1A involves cooperative functions between early adenoviral genes that inhibit apoptosis and stimulate cell cycle progression. The differential regulation by E1A12S of cyclin D1 compared with cyclin A likely reflects distinct cell cycle regulatory mechanisms. In the current studies E1A12S inhibition of both cyclin D1 and cyclin E required the amino-terminal p300 binding domain. Cyclin A was activated by E1A12S and was unaffected by mutation of the E1A amino terminus. Previous studies in cultured cells had shown that E1A inhibited cyclin D1 mRNA and protein (29Spitkovsky D. Steiner P. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Eilers M. Jansen P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2421-2425PubMed Google Scholar, 37Buchou T. Kranenburg O. van Dam H. Roelen D. Zantema A. Hall F.L. van der Eb A.J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that activation of cyclin A by E1A12S involved a p107-dependent mechanism (69Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Schulze A. Joswig S. Henglein B. Jansen-Durr P. J. Virol. 1995; 70: 2637-2642Crossref Google Scholar). Our studies are consistent with a role for cyclin D1 as a downstream gene targeted for inhibition by E1A12S as part of the adenoviral anti-apoptotic function. Several observations in the current study are consistent with a role for cyclin D1 as an inhibitor of apoptosis. UV irradiation-induced apoptosis was inhibited by overexpression of either p300 or cyclin D1. Embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice homozygously deleted of the cyclin D1 −/− gene showed increased apoptosis compared with MEFs of identical passage number from wild type fibroblasts. p300 also inhibited apoptosis in UV-irradiated wild type MEFs. In contrast, p300 overexpression did not inhibit apoptosis in thecyclin D1−/− MEFs, in fact there was a modest but reproducible induction. These findings are consistent with the finding of increased retinal apoptosis in the cyclin D1 −/− retina (24Ma C. Papermaster D. Cepko C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9938-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in contrast with studies in which cyclin D1 inducibly overexpressed in cultured neural (83Kranenburg O. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) or mammary epithelial cell (26Han E.K.-H. Begeman M. Sgambato A. Soh J.-W. Doki Y. Xing W.-Q. Liu W. Weinstein I.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 699-710PubMed Google Scholar) increased apoptosis rate. Although the mechanisms governing apoptosis by cyclin D1 are likely complex and cell type-specific, these studies provide important insights into the role of basal cyclin D1 abundance in apoptosis and suggest an important role for cyclin D1 in p300-mediated inhibition of apoptosis.The inhibition of apoptosis by cyclin D1 may contribute to its transforming function in specific cell types. E1A cooperates with cyclin D1 in cellular transformation (84Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and E1A can inactivate cellular reponses needed for Ras-mediated inhibition of cellular growth by converting ras into a growth-promoting gene (85Hirakawa T. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 85: 1519-1523Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Expression of E1A is insufficient to transform baby rat kidney cells because cell cycle disruption by E1A also stimulates p53-dependent apoptosis (86Sabbatini P. Chiou D. Nicholson D. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 15: 1060-1070Crossref Google Scholar). In baby rat kidney cells, ectopic expression of p300 bound E1A and inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis (36Thomas A. White E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both Myc and E1A are potent inducers of apoptosis (52Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L.

Among them, group IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) is thought to play a pivotal role in the progression of inflammatory conditions, since its local and systemic levels are elevated in numerous inflammatory diseases (18Gronroots J.M.

The expression of its mRNA dramatically changes upon challenge with endotoxin in rats and sPLA2-IIA-deficient mice, suggesting its potential role in the progression of inflammatory processes. Human group X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) has been cloned from fetal lung based on sPLA2-related sequences from DNA data bases (9Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.-G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The sPLA2-X cDNA clone suggests a mature sPLA2 protein of 123 amino acids and the presence of a signal peptide with 32 amino acids. The presence of an arginine doublet and other polar residues preceding the mature sPLA2-X protein indicates that the signal sequence is a prepropeptide, although there is no biochemical evidence for the cleavage sites. sPLA2-X is the most acidic (pI 5.3) among human sPLA2s thus far identified and contains one potential glycosylation site. This sPLA2 possesses 16 cysteine residues located at positions characteristic of both sPLA2-IB and sPLA2-IIA/IID and also has an amino acid COOH-terminal extension that is typical of sPLA2-IIA and -IID. A 1.5-kilobase transcript coding for sPLA2-X was detected in human spleen and thymus, suggesting its potential role in the immune system and/or inflammation (9Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.-G.

Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), although there are no data available with respect to its functional role in physiological and pathological conditions. To define the biochemical properties of human sPLA2-X, we prepared the antibody (Ab) and purified the protein. We found that human sPLA2-X releases arachidonic acid from PC more efficiently than other sPLA2 groups and also induces a rapid and marked release of arachidonic acid from several human myeloid leukemia cells compared with sPLA2-IB and -IIA. We also present evidence for the expression of sPLA2-X in human alveolar epithelial cells by immunohistochemical analysis. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Kokusai Shiyaku KK (Kobe, Japan). Recombinant human sPLA2-IB was prepared as described previously (28Arita H. Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Oka S. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19139-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant human sPLA2-IIA was a generous gift from Dr. Ruth Kramer (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN). Diheptanoylthio-PC was synthesized as described previously (24Hagishita S. Yamada M. Shirahase K. Okuda T. Murakami Y. Ito Y. Matsuura T. Wada M. Kato T. Ueno M. Chikazawa Y. Yamada K. Ono T. Teshirogi I. Ohtani M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3636-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). AACOCF3 was obtained from Cayman Chemicals. 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was obtained from Wako Chemicals, Japan. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PPPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PAPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, and 1- palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. 1-Palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PDPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PLPE) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. The coding region of human sPLA2-X cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using human placenta cDNA as a template. The sequences of the upstream and downstream primers were: hGX-S, (5′-CTGTGTACGCGTCCACCATGCTGCTCCTGCTACTGCCGTC-3′; and hGX-AS, 5′-TCAAGTGCGGCCGCTCAGTCACACTTGGGCGAGTCC-3′, respectively. hGX-S had a Kozak sequence and an MluI recognition site. hGX-AS possessed a NotI recognition site. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, for 35 cycles. The PCR-amplified fragment was digested withMluI and NotI followed by the insertion into the modified pBS-SK(−). After sequencing confirmation, COOH-terminal His-tagged sPLA2-X (sPLA2-X-HisTag) was constructed by PCR using hGX-S primer and hGX-H6AS primer: 5′-TCAAGTGCGGCCGCTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGGTCACACTTGGGCGAGTCCGGCT-3′ (the underlined sequence corresponds to the His tag). The PCR-amplified fragment was digested with NotI andXhoI, which had a recognition site in the coding region of sPLA2-X followed by exchange of the corresponding region in the native sPLA2-X plasmid. The sequence of the PCR-amplified region was confirmed, and the cDNAs were inserted into the mammalian cell expression vector under SR-α promoter. The sPLA2-V cDNA was amplified by PCR from human heart cDNA as a template using the primers 5′-AAAGAACGCGTCCACCATGAAAGGCCTCCTCCCACTGGCT-3′ and 5′-CTCGCTGCGGCCGCCTAGGAGCAGAGGATGTTGGGAAA-3′. The upstream primer had a Kozak sequence and an MluI recognition site. The downstream primer possessed a NotI recognition site. The amplified fragment was digested with MluI andNotI followed by subcloning in the modified pBS-SK(−). The sPLA2-V expression plasmid was constructed by the same method as described above. The preparation of sPLA2-IID cDNA and its expression plasmid were performed as described previously (10Ishizaki J. Suzuki N. Higashino K. Yokota Y. Ono T. Kawamoto K. Fujii N. Arita H. Hanasaki K. J.

(36Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Dennis E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 180 μl of the reaction mixture solution containing 1 mm diheptanoylthio-PC, 0.3 mm Triton X-100, 0.12 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 10 mmCaCl2, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.1% BSA in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) was preincubated in a 96-well plate for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of the enzyme preparation and continued for an appropriate time at 37 °C. The reaction was monitored by the absorbance at 405 nm. Recombinant plasmid containing sPLA2-X-HisTag and 0.5 μg of hygromycin B-resistant gene were co-transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney 293 (293T) cells with LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the stably expressing clones were generated by selection against hygromycin B (250 μg/ml). Expression of the recombinant protein was determined with the chromogenic PLA2 assay. The conditioned medium (10% fetal calf serum (FCS)) was applied to a Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and the bound materials were eluted with 500 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Peak fractions of PLA2 activity were dialyzed against 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and loaded on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5m. The sPLA2-X-HisTag fractions was then applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column (Cosmosil, 5C18 300AR, 4.6 × 150 mm, Nacarai Tesque, Japan) with a gradient of acetonitrile from 20 to 95% in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The chromogenic PLA2 assay revealed that sPLA2-X-HisTag was eluted at 43% acetonitrile. The eluted materials were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 15–25% acrylamide gradient gels (Daiichi Chemicals, Co.). In separate experiments, the purified protein was treated with 0.2 unit ofN-glycosidase F (E-5003; Oxford GlycoSystems) in 0.5% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% Nonidet P-40 for 18 h at 37 °C. After SDS-PAGE, electroblotting of proteins to an Immobilion-P membrane (Millipore Co.) was performed as described previously (37Hanasaki K. Powell L.D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7543-7550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the protein bands were excised, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer. Recombinant plasmid containing sPLA2-V or sPLA2-IID was transfected into CHO cells with LipofectAMINE reagent, and stably expressing clones were generated by selection against G418 (1 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). In the case of sPLA2-IID, the recombinant enzyme was partially purified with a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (10Ishizaki J. Suzuki N. Higashino K.

After immunization of rabbits with purified sPLA2-X-HisTag (200 μg), the anti-serum was prepared, and the IgG fractions were purified with a HiTrap protein G-column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specificity and titer of the anti-serum and purified Ab were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as follows. The 96-well plates (Nunc, Immuno MaxiSorp plate) coated with purified sPLA2 proteins (100 ng) were blocked with Block-Ace solution (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals Co.) and incubated with anti-sPLA2-X Ab, anti-human sPLA2-IB Ab (Seikagaku Corp.), and anti-human sPLA2-IIA serum (Cayman Chemical Co.) for 2 h. After washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, the plates were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Immunotech) followed by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.3) containing 0.01% (v/v) H2O2. The reaction was stopped by addition of 4n H2SO4, and the plates were read at 492 nm. In separate experiments, the plates were coated with sPLA2-X-HisTag or Axl-HisTag proteins and assayed as described above. The inhibitory effects of anti-sPLA2-X Ab on PLA2 activity were examined with the chromogenic assay. Purified sPLA2 proteins (50 ng), partially purified sPLA2-IID, and the conditioned medium from the sPLA2-V-expressing CHO cells were incubated with anti-sPLA2-X Ab for 2 h and then added to the reaction mixture solution, as described above. The inhibitory potency of anti-sPLA2-X Ab was examined at the times when each sPLA2 reaction reached the sub-maximum at 37 °C. Transfection with sPLA2-X expression plasmid and preparation of stably expressing clones were performed as described above, and the established CHO cells were grown in 10% FCS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After reaching confluence, the medium was changed to serum-free PM-1000 medium (Eiken Co., Japan), and the cells were incubated for 3 days. The conditioned medium was then applied to the anti-sPLA2-X Ab-conjugated affinity column, which had been prepared by coupling of anti-sPLA2-X IgG (30 mg) to HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing with 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 1.7). For further separation, the affinity-purified materials were applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column with a gradient of 20 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The three major fractions were collected, dried, and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.3 m NaCl. Human sPLA2s were subjected to individual reactions with 12 types of commercially available phospholipids as a substrate. These sPLA2 materials were also subjected to reactions with the mixed phospholipids composed of four types of PCs or three types of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) as the substrates. The enzymatic activity was measured using mixed micelles of 3 mm sodium deoxycholate (DOC) and 1 mm of each substrate or micelles of 3 mm DOC and mixed PCs or PEs consisting of 0.25 mm concentrations of each substrate in a total volume of 100 μl. The assay mixture contained 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 150 mm NaCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After the incubation at 40 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Dole's reagent (heptane, 2-propanol, 2 n sulfuric acid = 10:40:1, v/v/v), and the released fatty acids were quantified according to the method of Tojo et al. (38Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS and pretreated with 1.3% dimethyl sulfoxide for 2 days before the assay (39Kubin M. Chow J.M. Trinchieri G. Blood. 1994; 83: 1847-1855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, the cells were suspended in Hanks' buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 0.1% BSA at a density of 5.56 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots of cell suspension (0.45 ml) were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C and stimulated with sPLA2 proteins (0.05 ml). To analyze the released fatty acids, the reaction was stopped with 2 ml of Dole's reagent, and 3 nmol of margaric acid (Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc.) was added as an internal standard. After the addition of 1.2 ml of heptane and 0.8 ml of water, the heptane phase was removed and dried in vacuo, and the fatty acids in this fraction were labeled with 9-anthryldiazomethane (Funakoshi Co.), as described by Tojo et al. (38Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a LiChroCART 125–4 Superspher 100 RP-18 column (Merck) with acetonitrile/water (97:3, v/v) as the solvent. The column oven temperature was 26 °C, and the column effluents were monitored by the fluorescence intensity at the wavelengths of excitation and emission of 365 and 412 nm, respectively. To measure PGE2and LTC4, the reaction was stopped by cooling on ice. The supernatant was then collected after centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the released PGE2and LTC4 were quantified with a radioimmunoassay kit (NEN Life Science Products) and an ELISA kit (Cayman Chemicals Co.), respectively. Human U937 and HL60 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) grown in 10% FCS, RPMI 1640 were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (0.5 μCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 18 h. After washing three times, the cells were resuspended in 10% FCS, RPMI 1640. Aliquots of cell suspension (5 × 105 cells) were stimulated with sPLA2 proteins in a total volume of 400 μl at 37 °C. After the reaction, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C, and the released radioactivity in the supernatant (100 μl) was counted. Total incorporated radioactivity into the cells used for one assay was 1.04 × 106 and 1.02 × 106 dpm in U937 and HL60 cells, respectively. Preparations of normal adult human lung tissue were purchased from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). The tissue slides were dewaxed, incubated in methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min, and then treated with 5% normal rabbit serum for 20 min. The slides were incubated with anti-sPLA2-X Ab (6 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 14 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, they were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min followed by treatment with horseradish peroxidase avidin-biotin complex reagent (Vector Laboratories). After washing, the peroxidase activity was visualized with 10-min incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 200 μg/ml diaminobenzidine and 0.006% H2O2. After th"

Previously, we detected two mammalian nuclear proteins of 100 and 75 kDa (POMp100 and POMp75, respectively) that are able to promote homologous DNA pairing, a key step in homologous recombination. Here we describe the identification of human (h) POMp75 as the pro-oncoprotein TLS/FUS. hPOMp75/TLS binds both single- and double-stranded DNAs and mediates annealing of complementary DNA strands. More important, it promotes the uptake of a single-stranded oligonucleotide into a homologous superhelical DNA to form a D-loop. The formation of a D-loop is an essential step in DNA double-strand break repair through recombination. DNA annealing and D-loop formation catalyzed by hPOMp75/TLS require Mg2+ and are ATP-independent. Interestingly, the oncogenic fusion form TLS-CHOP is not able to promote DNA pairing.

DSBs are generated by chemical damaging agents and ionizing radiation and are specifically induced during meiosis. Unrepaired or aberrantly repaired DSBs can lead to chromosomal rearrangements, eventually resulting in the formation of tumors or cell death. In mammalian cells, two major pathways for DSB repair are non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. In Escherichia coli, RecA protein plays a crucial role in DSB repair by promoting homologous pairing and strand exchange between homologous DNAs (1Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5355-5358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Discovery of homologues of RecA in every eukaryote examined has underscored conservation of similar repair mechanisms throughout evolution (3Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev.

The finding that human and yeast Rad51 proteins promote ATP-dependent homologous pairing and strand exchange further support their central role in recombination and DSB repair (11Sung P.

Although these studies indicate that the basic mechanism and key players of DSB repair are evolutionarily conserved, the process in higher eukaryotes is much more complex than in E. coli and involves a number of additional factors. In this context, evidence is accumulating for a possible role for the tumor suppressor proteins p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 in DNA recombination and repair (4Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem.

This includes interaction of p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 with RAD51; colocalization of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 on the axial elements of the synaptonemal complexes during meiosis; similarities in expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51; and early embryonic lethality of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51 nullizygous mice, which is partially suppressed by homozygous p53 germ-line mutation. We have developed an in vitro pairing on membrane (POM) assay to measure homologous DNA-pairing activities in cellular extracts (16Bertrand P. Corteggiani E. Dutreix M. Coppey J. Lopez B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Akhmedov A.T. Bertrand P. Corteggiani E. Lopez B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using this approach, we have detected two mammalian nuclear proteins of 100 and 75 kDa (POMp100 and POMp75, respectively) that are able to promote ATP-independent homologous DNA pairing that does not require an associated exonuclease activity (17Akhmedov A.T.

In this work, we describe the purification of hPOMp75 from HeLa nuclei and its identification as the human pro-oncoprotein TLS (also known as FUS). TLS (translocated inliposarcoma) is a member of the TETfamily of genes that includes EWS, a gene commonly involved in other sarcomas and TAFII68 that encodes a component of the basal transcriptional machinery (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 19Rabbits T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat.

Although the oncogenic forms of TLS have been the subject of intense investigation, much less is known about the function of its normal cellular form. We demonstrate that purified hPOMp75/TLS binds ssDNA and dsDNA and promotes ATP-independent annealing of complementary ssDNAs and D-loop formation in superhelical dsDNA. The oncogenic fusion form TLS-CHOP is not able to promote DNA pairing. These data suggest a possible role for hPOMp75/TLS in maintenance of genomic integrity. Single- and double-stranded M13mp19 replicative form I DNAs and plasmid pUC19 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; φX174 ssDNA and dsDNA were from New England Biolabs Inc.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) was dialyzed extensively against TED buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) with 50 mm NaCl and the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The precipitate formed during dialysis was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h, and the pellet was extracted with TEDU buffer (TED buffer + 6m urea) and 100 mm NaCl (Fraction II). Fraction II was loaded onto a HiLoad Q-Sepharose 16/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a HiTrap heparin column (5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with TEDU buffer and 100 mm NaCl. After washes with TEDU buffer and 100 mm NaCl, the HiTrap heparin column was disconnected and developed with a 60-ml gradient of 150–600 mm NaCl in TEDU buffer. The fractions containing the peak of hPOMp75 activity that eluted at ∼350 mm NaCl were pooled (Fraction III), diluted 2-fold with TEDU buffer to lower the ionic strength, and loaded onto an UNO S column (5 ml; Bio-Rad). The hPOMp75 activity was eluted with a 60-ml gradient of 200–600 mm NaCl in TED buffer. The active fractions that eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl were pooled (Fraction IV) and applied directly onto a Bio-Scale CHT-I hydroxylapatite column (2 ml; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with TED buffer and 300 mm NaCl. The flow-through (Fraction V) was diluted 2-fold with TED buffer and loaded onto an UNO S Polishing column (0.16 ml; Bio-Rad), which was developed with a 5-ml gradient of 150–500 mm NaCl in TED buffer. hPOMp75 eluted from the column at ∼300 mm NaCl, the pool of which (Fraction VI) was concentrated in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc.) and stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. His6-tagged recombinant TLS (rTLS) was expressed inE. coli as described (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). rTLS was purified under denaturing conditions in the presence of 6 m urea using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN Inc.) followed by heparin affinity chromatography under native conditions. His6-tagged rTLS-CHOP was expressed in E. coliand purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). For microsequencing, purified hPOMp75 (Fraction VI) was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the 75-kDa polypeptide was digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography, and selected peptides were sequenced by standard procedures using an Applied Biosystems Model 494 HT automated sequencing apparatus. The derived peptide sequences were compared with the EBI and Swiss Protein Data Banks using the computer programs FastA and Blast. For Western blot detection, protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% BisTris gels (Novex) and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibody probing was performed according to standard techniques, and proteins were visualized using the Supersignal system (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. Anti-TLS monoclonal antibody 4H11 was described previously (23Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). INDIA HisProbe horseradish peroxidase (anti-His) was from Pierce; anti-CHOP (GADD153) mouse monoclonal antibody (B-3) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoprecipitation, HeLa nuclear extracts were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with anti-TLS antibody-coupled protein G-Sepharose beads in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40) for 12 h at 4 °C on a rotator apparatus. The beads were subsequently washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and 500 mm NaCl. Unbound (supernatant) and bound (immunoprecipitate) fractions were analyzed by the POM assay. The POM assay was performed essentially as described (17Akhmedov A.T. Bertrand P. Corteggiani E. Lopez B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay measures the ability of nuclear proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane to pair labeled linear dsDNA with homologous ssDNA immobilized on the membrane. Autoradiography revealed homologous pairing activity as a radioactive band, corresponding to the migration of the proteins displaying this activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 12–24 nm (6000 cpm) 5′-32P-labeled 49-mer oligonucleotide in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protein as indicated. In competition experiments, competitor DNAs were added 5 min before the probe. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. 32P-Labeled DNA was detected by autoradiography and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and area integration modes. Complementary DNA strands were obtained by heat denaturation of a 3′-32P labeled 422-base pair DNA fragment, produced by AvaI digestion of M13mp18 replicative form I DNA (21Borggrefe T. Wabl M. Akhmedov A.T. Jessberger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17025-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 60 nmheat-denatured 32P-labeled 422-base pair DNA fragment, and various amounts of protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 10% SDS and 100 mm EDTA and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide). 32P-Labeled DNA was detected by autoradiography and quantified using the PhosphorImager. Various amounts of protein were preincubated at room temperature for 5 min with 0.3–0.4 μm32P-labeled 49-mer in reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After preincubation, superhelical pUCSγ DNA was added at 30 μm, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, unless otherwise stated. At various times, reactions were stopped and deproteinized at 37 °C for 15 min in 0.5% SDS and 2 mg/ml proteinase K. The products were analyzed on 0.8% agarose gels in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2run at 2 V/cm for 16 h at 4 °C and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. 32P-Labeled DNA was detected by autoradiography and quantified using the PhosphorImager. Since D-loop formation was performed with a 3-fold molar (molecule) excess of oligonucleotide relative to dsDNA, the percentage of D-loop formation was calculated relative to the limiting amount of dsDNA. We previously described a 75-kDa protein as one of the major DNA-pairing proteins detected by the POM assay in different mammalian cell lines (17Akhmedov A.T. Bertrand P. Corteggiani E. Lopez B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using the POM blot as a functional assay, we purified hPOMp75 from HeLa nuclear extracts (HNEs) to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 B) and used it in the studies described below. In all purification steps, the hPOMp75 activity coincided with the presence a 75-kDa protein (Fig.1 C). No nuclease activity with ssDNA or dsDNA was detected in the purified fraction (data not shown). Moreover, the purified protein did not contain any hRAD51 protein as revealed by immunoblot analysis of the preparation with anti-RAD51 antibodies purchased from Calbiochem (data not shown). hPOMp75 (Fraction VI) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to internal sequence analysis. Four peptide sequences were obtained (Fig.2 A) and found to be identical to that of the human pro-oncoprotein TLS (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 19Rabbits T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we immunoprecipitated TLS from HNEs with an excess of monoclonal antibody 4H11 to TLS (23Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in significant depletion of the hPOMp75 activity from the extract and recovery of such activity in the immune complex (Fig. 2 B). The hPOMp100 activity was unaffected by these steps, reflecting the specificity of the immunodepletion procedure. hPOMp75 purified from HeLa nuclei and bacterially expressed recombinant TLS exhibited similar electrophoretic mobility and DNA-pairing activity and were recognized by the anti-TLS monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 C). These results establish the identity of TLS to a component of the hPOMp75 activity. TLS was shown to contain an RNA-binding domain of the RRM type and to bind RNA in vitro and in vivo (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 23Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously that the human 75-kDa DNA-pairing activity bound to ssDNA- and dsDNA-cellulose (17Akhmedov A.T. Bertrand P. Corteggiani E. Lopez B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we investigated further the DNA-binding properties of hPOMp75/TLS. Upon incubation of increasing amounts of hPOMp75/TLS with the32P-labeled 49-mer oligonucleotide, protein-DNA complexes that exhibited retarded mobility were observed (Fig.3 A). In contrast to RecA protein or its human homologues (RAD51 and DMC1), the addition of ATP had no effect on the binding (data not shown). To compare hPOMp75/TLS affinity for ssDNA and dsDNA, its binding to the labeled 49-mer oligonucleotide was carried out in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor φX174 replicative form I ssDNA or dsDNA. φX174 ssDNA competed more efficiently with the labeled oligonucleotide for hPOMp75/TLS binding than did φX174 dsDNA. Indeed, a 12-fold molar excess of ssDNA completely abolished binding, whereas a 24-fold molar excess of duplex competitor was needed to achieve a similar effect (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 3–6 with lanes 7–10). Similar results were obtained with M13mp19 ssDNA and dsDNA (data not shown). Thus, hPOMp75/TLS binds both ssDNA and dsDNA, with a 2-fold higher affinity for ssDNA. To examine the ability of hPOMp75/TLS to anneal complementary ssDNAs, we incubated increasing amounts of the protein with a heat-denatured32P-labeled 422-base pair DNA fragment. The products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4, hPOMp75/TLS promoted annealing of 422-nucleotide DNA strands in a concentration-dependent manner. Optimal activity was observed at one hPOMp75/TLS molecule/6–10 nucleotides of ssDNA. The reaction required Mg2+, but not ATP (Fig. 4, lanes 12 and 13; data not shown). Under optimal conditions, the efficiency of hPOMp75/TLS-promoted renaturation approached 50% within 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, and further incubation did not result in an increase of the product (Fig. 4). The incorporation of ssDNA into homologous duplex DNA, leading to the formation of a D-loop, is an essential feature of homologous recombination. The E. coli recombination proteins RecA, RecT, and RecO and the yeast (S. cerevisiae Rad51) and human (DMC1) RecA homologues are able to catalyze this reaction (25Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 26McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 11221-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, this in vitro reaction cannot have resulted from contaminating exonuclease activity since such activity should diminish D-loop formation. To study the ability of hPOMp75/TLS to promote the formation of D-loops, hPOMp75/TLS was incubated with the32P-labeled 49-mer oligonucleotide and the homologous superhelical dsDNA. Following incubation, protein was removed by the addition of proteinase K, SDS, and EDTA, and the reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of radioactivity into the superhelical DNA was visualized by autoradiography. As a positive control, we tested the D-loop formation catalyzed by E. coli RecA protein using the same DNA substrates. hPOMp75/TLS promoted the formation of stable D-loops in a homology-dependent manner (Fig.5 B). Two major DNA bands were observed similar to those formed in the RecA-mediated reaction (Fig.5 B, compare lanes 8–10 with lane 12). The more slowly migrating DNA species migrated similarly to relaxed dsDNA and might represent the assimilation of ssDNA into relaxed dsDNA present in the superhelical DNA preparation. In agreement with results reported previously for RecA protein (25Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), this reaction is less efficient. When the superhelical dsDNA was replaced with the linear dsDNA, no D-loop formation was detected (Fig. 5 B, lane 3). The yield of D-loops formed by hPOMp75/TLS was dependent on the duration of incubation and protein concentration (Fig. 5,B and C). It increased up to 14% at 40 nm hPOMp75/TLS after 40 min of incubation at 37 °C. In contrast to the pseudo-reversible reaction mediated by RecA (31Shibata T. Ohtani T. Iwabuchi M. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the hPOMp75/TLS-promoted reaction was much slower and did not exhibit the pseudo-reversibility. Optimal activity occurred at roughly one hPOMp75/TLS molecule/8–13 nucleotides of ssDNA. Similar results were obtained with a 60-mer oligonucleotide and homologous superhelical pUC19 or M13mp19 DNAs (data not shown). The reaction catalyzed by hPOMp75/TLS required Mg2+, and optimal activity was observed at 2.5–5 mm Mg2+(Fig. 5 B, lanes 11 and 13–15). In contrast to the RecA-promoted reaction, the addition or omission of ATP had no effect on D-loop formation (Fig. 5 C, comparelanes 6 and 7). The RNA-binding proteins SF2/ASF and U2AF65 have previously been shown to promote annealing of complementary nucleic acid strands (32Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 33Lee C.-G. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13472-13478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the evidence that these proteins and hPOMp75/TLS have at least one highly conserved RNA recognition motif of the RRM type, it raises the question whether D-loop formation is a specific feature of hPOMp75/TLS. Therefore, we tested the ability of SF2/ASF and U2AF65 to promote D-loop formation. In contrast to hPOMp75/TLS, both proteins did not mediate the formation of D-loops (data not shown). In human myxoid and round cell liposarcomas, chromosomal translocation fusesTLS to the CHOP (also known asGADD145) gene, resulting in expression of the fusion oncoprotein TLS-CHOP (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 19Rabbits T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To investigate the DNA-pairing activity of TLS-CHOP, bacterially expressed TLS-CHOP was purified by nickel chelate chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-His and anti-CHOP antibodies. Although TLS-CHOP is slightly bigger than TLS (75 versus 68 kDa), both proteins exhibited similar electrophoretic mobility under our SDS-PAGE conditions (Fig.6, upper panel). Only TLS-CHOP, however, was recognized by the anti-CHOP monoclonal antibody, whereas both recombinant proteins reacted with antibodies to the polyhistidine tag in the N terminus of the proteins (Fig. 6,middle panels). Interestingly, when equal amounts of rTLS or rTLS-CHOP were examined by the POM assay, rTLS-CHOP was completely inactive, whereas rTLS displayed a high POM activity (Fig. 6,lower panel). Using an assay that measures homologous DNA pairing in cell extracts, we have purified a 75-kDa DNA-pairing protein (termed hPOMp75) from HeLa nuclei. Microsequencing and immunoblot analysis revealed its identity to the human pro-oncoprotein TLS (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 19Rabbits T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Moreover, purified bacterially expressed TLS promotes homologous DNA pairing and exhibits major functional characteristics identical to those of hPOMp75 purified from HeLa nuclei. However, TLS exists in mammalian cells in a complex with RNA and other proteins, and these are co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to TLS (23Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot exclude that comigrating components of this complex such as TAFII68 might also contribute to the hPOMp75 activity in HeLa extracts. hPOMp75/TLS binds both ssDNA and dsDNA, with a slightly higher affinity for ssDNA. In contrast to RecA protein or its human homologues (RAD51 and DMC1), ATP is not required for DNA binding of hPOMp75. Unlike RecA protein (35Menetski J.P. Kowalzcykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and similar to hRAD51 protein (36Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), hPOMp75/TLS does not bind to ssDNA with high cooperativity. One of the characteristic activities associated with homologous DNA-pairing proteins like E. coli RecA, RecT, and RecO;Ustilago maydis Rec2; and S. cerevisiae Rad52 is the ability to catalyze the annealing of two complementary DNA strands (37Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Kmiec E.B. Cole A. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7163-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This type of activity has also been demonstrated with hPOMp75/TLS. The hPOMp75/TLS-promoted annealing requires Mg2+, but unlike the RecA- or Rec2-mediated reactions, is ATP-independent. In this respect, the reaction is similar to that promoted by RecT or RecO (38Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the ability to anneal complementary ssDNA molecules is a prerequisite of recombination proteins, it is a rather simple reaction that can occur nonenzymatically and that can be facilitated by unrelated proteins and by agents that concentrate or condense DNA (3Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In this regard, D-loop formation is a much more specific reaction, representing an invasion of a single-stranded end of one molecule into intact homologous duplex DNA, an essential step in DSB repair through recombination. hPOMp75/TLS is able to catalyze the formation of D-loops in superhelical duplex DNA. The reaction promoted by hPOMp75/TLS differs in several respects from that promoted by RecA: it does not require ATP or ATPγS, is much slower, and does not exhibit pseudo-reversibility. Similar characteristics have been demonstrated for the formation of D-loops by RecT and RecO proteins (27Noirot P. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12274-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The hPOMp75/TLS-promoted D-loop formation requires Mg2+; however, the optimal concentration of the ion is lower than for the RecA-promoted reaction. The formation of D-loops by RecO protein and strand transfer by hRAD51 are also optimal at low Mg2+concentrations, implying inability of these proteins to remove secondary structures from ssDNA (39Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Finally, the ability to promote D-loop formation is a specific feature of hPOMp75/TLS; two other RNA-binding proteins, SF2/ASF and U2AF65, which efficiently mediate RNA and DNA annealing (32Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 33Lee C.-G. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13472-13478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are not able to promote D-loop formation. The biochemical characterization of hPOMp75/TLS presented here suggests that the protein may play a role in homologous DNA pairing and recombination. This hypothesis is supported by recent observations made on mice with an induced mutation in Tls. MaleTls −/− mice are sterile, with demonstrable defects in chromosome pairing during meiosis. Nuclear extracts fromTls −/− testes lack the POMp75 activity. Moreover, mutant mice and cells derived from them exhibit increased sensitivity to ionizing irradiation. 2M. Kuroda, J. Sok, L. Webb, H. Baechtold, F. Urano, Y. Yin, P. Chung, D. G. de Rooij, A. Akhmedov, T. Ashley, and D. Ron, submitted for publication. TLS was originally identified as contributing the N-terminal part of fusion genes with CHOP in myxoid liposarcoma or withERG in acute myeloid leukemia (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 19Rabbits T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat.

The N-terminal portion of TLS is a potent transcriptional activator essential for the oncogenic potential of TLS-CHOP and TLS-ERG fusion proteins, whereas the C terminus is required for RNA binding (18Crozat A.Y. Aman P. Mandal N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 24Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P.

The association of TLS with components of the basal transcriptional machinery (20Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and transcription factors (43Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) suggests participation of this multifunctional protein in various aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. TLS nucleic acid-binding activity may be activated by BCR/ABL, an abnormal form of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase (45Perrotti D. Bonatti S. Trotta R. Martinez R. Skorski T. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Iozzo R.V. Cooper D.R. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4442-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). c-Abl kinase activity is normally regulated by genotoxic agents (46Kharbanda S. Ren R.

These results suggest the possibility that hPOMp75/TLS and c-Abl may participate in the same pathway activated by DSB. Of note is that c-Abl has recently been shown to interact with hRAD51 and to inhibit in vitro its recombination activity by phosphorylation (48Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T.

Several recent reports have suggested the association of factors controlling tumorigenesis such as p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 with DSB repair machinery (4Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem.

In addition to the well established role of p53 in DNA repair via cell cycle control, it is suspected to participate more directly in this process (49Dudenhöffer C. Rohaly G. Will K. Deppert W. Wiesmüller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The pro-oncoprotein hPOMp75/TLS might represent another example of a tumorigenic factor with recombination enzymatic potential. Intriguingly, its oncogenic fusion form, TLS-CHOP, is not able to promote DNA pairing under the POM conditions. Given the presence of the second normal allele of TLS in liposarcomas, it is tempting to speculate that TLS-CHOP may interfere with hPOMp75/TLS function in DNA repair, leading to additional instability of liposarcoma cells. Further experimental evidence is needed to substantiate this hypothesis and to elucidate a role for this multifunctional protein in maintenance of genomic integrity.

https://openalex.org/W2090595109,"Among the five membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMPs have about a 20-amino acid cytoplasmic tail following the transmembrane domain. In contrast, a putative transmembrane domain of MT4-MMP locates at the very C-terminal end, and the expected cytoplasmic tail is very short or nonexistent. Such sequences often act as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring signal rather than as a transmembrane domain. We thus examined the possibility that MT4-MMP is a GPI-anchored proteinase. Our results showed that [(3)H]ethanolamine, which can be incorporated into the GPI unit, specifically labeled the MT4-MMP C-terminal end in a sequence-dependent manner. In addition, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment released the MT4-MMP from the surface of transfected cells. These results indicate that MT4-MMP is the first GPI-anchored proteinase in the MMP family. During cultivation of the transfected cells, MT4-MMP appeared to be shed from the cell surface by the action of an endogenous metalloproteinase. GPI anchoring of MT4-MMP on the cell surface indicates a unique biological function and character for this proteinase."
https://openalex.org/W1981002854,"Regulated activation of the highly conserved Ras GTPase is a central event in the stimulation of cell proliferation, motility, and differentiation elicited by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In fibroblasts, this involves formation and membrane localization of Shc·Grb2·Sos complexes, which increases the rate of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange. In order to control Ras-mediated cell responses, this activity is regulated by receptor down-regulation and a feedback loop involving the dual specificity kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK). We investigated the role of EGFR endocytosis in the regulation of Ras activation. Of fundamental interest is whether activated receptors in endosomes can participate in the stimulation of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange, because the constitutive membrane localization of Ras may affect its compartmentalization. By exploiting the differences in postendocytic signaling of two EGFR ligands, epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α, we found that activated EGFR located at the cell surface and in internal compartments contribute equally to the membrane recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in NR6 fibroblasts expressing wild-type EGFR. Importantly, both the rate of Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange and the level of Ras-GTP were depressed to near basal values on the time scale of receptor trafficking. Using the selective MEK inhibitor PD098059, we were able to block the feedback desensitization pathway and maintain activation of Ras. Under these conditions, the generation of Ras-GTP was not significantly affected by the subcellular location of activated EGFR. In conjunction with our previous analysis of the phospholipase C pathway in the same cell line, this suggests a selective continuation of specific signaling activities and cessation of others upon receptor endocytosis.

This leads to activation of the EGFR catalytic tyrosine kinase domain, autophosphorylation of specific residues in its carboxyl terminus, and recruitment and phosphorylation of heterologous signaling proteins (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The EGFR can also transactivate other members of the erbB receptor family via heterodimerization, enhancing the diversity of potential signaling interactions (2Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Overexpression and activating mutations of EGFR and other erbB family members, in conjunction with other permissive mutations, have been widely implicated in transformation and tumorigenesis. Increased ligand secretion and autocrine signaling through the EGFR can also contribute to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Secretion of TGFα in particular is potently mitogenic, because its dissociation from EGFR after endocytosis promotes receptor recycling; the sparing of receptors from proteolysis allows unabated signaling in the presence of a continuous ligand source (3Rosenthal A.

Physiol. 1999; 179: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the interaction of EGF with the receptor persists after internalization by virtue of its relative insensitivity to decreases in pH, yielding continued tyrosine phosphorylation and, later, receptor down-regulation (5Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 6French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another broad determinant of cell transformation involves dysregulation of the 21-kDa Ras GTPase, a ubiquitous and highly conserved signaling protein normally converted to the GTP-bound active state in response to stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (8Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Interruption of Ras GTPase activity prevents hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, yielding a constitutively active Ras and unregulated cell proliferation. The biological activity of Ras is completely dependent on posttranslational modifications that lead to its insertion into the plasma membrane. Active Ras aids in the recruitment of other signaling proteins to the membrane via its effector loop, including the Raf serine/threonine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and activators of the Rho and Rac GTPases (10Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Activation of Raf initiates a kinase cascade involving successive activation of the dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) kinase (MEK) and Erk. In fibroblasts, this pathway is required for both cell cycle progression and cell motility, whereas a divergent signaling pathway involving phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) is required for cell motility but is dispensable for mitogenesis (11Chen P.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 616-625Google Scholar). Ras is positively modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which accelerate the dissociation of bound nucleotides. This favors the subsequent binding of the more abundant GTP from the cytosol. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases leads to the recruitment of Ras-GEF activity to the membrane, which is sufficient to elicit Ras activation (14Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 15Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8512-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Membrane localization is mediated by adaptor proteins such as Grb2, which uses its SH3 domains to complex with the Ras-GEF Sos and its SH2 domain to interact with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. For example, the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds the Y1068 minor autophosphorylation site of the EGFR (16Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). However, the Grb2 SH2 domain has a 5-fold higher affinity for the tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc adaptor protein (17Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which binds to autophosphorylated EGFR and erbB-2 using both SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains (18Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Given that Shc uses two high affinity phosphotyrosine recognition domains, and also that its preferred binding sites on the EGFR are more extensively phosphorylated than Y1068 in vivo (19Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 20Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct mechanisms have been identified that attenuate Ras activation in response to EGFR stimulation. These are desensitization by a MEK-dependent negative feedback loop, which causes disassembly of Shc·Grb2·Sos complexes (23de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Pronk G.J. Medema J.P. Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23421-23428Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). With regard to the latter mechanism, however, it is unclear when Ras activation is silenced during the intracellular trafficking of the EGFR. Shc can associate with endosomal membranes in response to EGF stimulation, and this Shc pool is efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated in rat liver (30Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 31Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the fact that Ras is a membrane-associated protein suggests that it might be compartmentalized. For example, we previously showed that activated EGFR in internal compartments effectively participate in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, but not in the hydrolysis of its membrane lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (32Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We therefore endeavored to determine whether active, internalized EGFR could participate in the activation of Ras. To deconvolute the two modes of Ras regulation, we employed the specific inhibitor PD098059 to block the MEK-dependent feedback loop in NR6 fibroblasts expressing wild-type EGFR, which prolonged Ras-GEF activity on the time scale of receptor internalization. We then quantitatively related the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, the coprecipitation of Shc with the EGFR, and the generation of Ras-GTP to the total level of EGFR autophosphorylation. These experiments were performed under conditions that manipulated the relative numbers of EGFR activated at the surface and in internal compartments. We found that receptors in internal compartments were at least as potent as surface receptors in stimulating all of the signaling determinants investigated. Thus, Ras activation mediated by EGFR is attenuated primarily by feedback desensitization rather than by receptor internalization. Coupled with our previous findings that internalized EGFR does not functionally participate in the phospholipase C pathway in the same cell line, these data demonstrate that internalized EGFR can selectively either continue or cease signaling through different pathways. NR6 mouse fibroblasts transfected with wild-type human EGFR (NR6 WT) (11Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 33Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were quiesced at subconfluence using restricted serum conditions without G418 (MEM-α/26 mm sodium bicarbonate with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin) for 18–24 h prior to experiments. Experiments were carried out in an air environment using MEM-α/13 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) with 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as the binding buffer. The activation of MEK was selectively blocked using PD098059 (34Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). The agent, purchased from Calbiochem, was dissolved to a stock concentration of 50 mmin Me2SO and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Just before use, an aliquot was warmed to 37 °C and diluted to 50 μm in warm binding buffer. In all cases, cells were preincubated with PD098059 for 60 min at 37 °C before growth factor challenge. This stimulation procedure allows the numbers of activated EGFR at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments following endocytosis to be varied independently, as described previously (32Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and illustrated in Fig.1. Briefly, after preincubation with either PD098059 or vehicle only (0.1% Me2SO), mouse EGF (Life Technologies) or human TGFα (Peprotech) was added to 20 nm in the same medium for 20 min. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold WHIPS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 7.4) and incubated in an acid wash (50 mm glycine-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 3.0) on ice for 2 min. By 1 min, this treatment is equally efficient in dissociating EGF and TGFα from surface EGFR of NR6 cells. After another wash with ice-cold WHIPS, cells were reequilibrated for 5 min in 37 °C binding buffer containing various concentrations of TGFα (0–20 nm) in the continued presence of either PD098059 or Me2SO only. Thus, a constant level of internal receptor activation, depending only on whether cells were pretreated with EGF or TGFα, is titrated with various levels of surface receptor activation following the acid wash. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR was assessed using a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High-binding 96-well plates (Corning) were precoated with 10 μg/ml anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody 225 in PBS and then with blocking buffer (10% horse serum/0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS), at room temperature. After various treatments, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm sodium iodoacetate, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A; transferred to an Eppendorf tube; and incubated on ice for 20 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, diluted to various extents in blocking buffer supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and incubated in the antibody-coated wells for 1 h at 37 °C. The amount of associated phosphotyrosine was determined using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated RC20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) substrate as described previously (32Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 1% Triton X-100 cell lysates were generated as detailed above. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 5 μg of PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-EGFR antibody 225 precoupled to protein G-Sepharose, or 5 μg of anti-Shc polyclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) precoupled to protein A-Sepharose. The antibody-coupled beads were incubated with equivalent total cellular protein amounts (determined by Micro BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard; Pierce) or with equivalent lysate volumes at 4 °C for 60–90 min. For the latter case, employed to enhance recovery of coprecipitating proteins, total protein amounts were determined subsequently. The Sepharose beads were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the residual liquid was removed with a syringe. Precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted using anti-Shc polyclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated RC20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Protein bands were detected and quantified using SuperSignal Ultra detection reagent (Pierce) and a Bio-Rad chemiluminescence screen and molecular imager, and band intensities were normalized to total cell protein amounts. After various treatments, cells were lysed in ice-cold Ras extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmMgCl2) supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A. After incubation on ice for 20 min, each lysate was clarified; transferred to a new tube; adjusted to 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS; and subjected to 2 h of immunoprecipitation at 4 °C using 3 μg of Y13-259 anti-Ras monoclonal antibody precoupled with 30 μg of rabbit anti-rat IgG and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed 10 times with high salt buffer (50 mmTris HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.005% SDS) and 3 times with 20 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, and residual liquid was removed using a syringe. The beads of each sample were resuspended in 40 μl of elution buffer (5 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol), boiled for 3 min, cooled briefly on ice, and pelleted for 5 min at 16,000 ×g. The supernatants, containing guanine nucleotides dissociated from the immunoprecipitated Ras, were collected and either analyzed immediately or stored at −80 °C. Ras-GEF activity was measured by permeabilization of cells with digitonin and uptake of [α-32P]GTP by Ras (35de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van der Voorn L. Downward J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells quiesced in 150-mm plates were washed once with ice-cold permeabilization buffer (10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EGTA, 0.64 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm ATP) after various treatments and then incubated with 0.5 ml of permabilization buffer supplemented with freshly added 0.1% digitonin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 25 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products) for 2 min at 37 °C. The liquid was aspirated carefully. Cells were lysed, Ras was immunoprecipitated, and nucleotides were eluted as described above, except that 1 mm ATP and 100 μm each of GTP and GDP were included in the extraction buffer, and clarified lysates were precleared using 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 5 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity eluted from Ras was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The extent of Ras activation was determined using quantitative assays developed by Scheele et al. (36Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that independently assess absolute, fmol amounts of GDP and GTP eluted from Ras immunoprecipitates. Ras was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and guanine nucleotides were eluted, as described above. The absolute amount of GTP eluted from immunoprecipitated Ras was determined using a kinetic assay, in which GTP is converted to ATP by nucleoside 5′-diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) in the presence of excess ADP, and ATP is consumed by the highly sensitive firefly luciferase reaction to produce light (36Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reaction, monitored in a photon-counting luminometer (MGM Instruments), contained equal volumes of eluate sample and an enzyme mixture. The latter consisted of ATP assay mix (Sigma; FL-AAM), supplemented with 1 μm ADP (purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to remove ATP contamination) and 1 unit/ml NDP kinase (Sigma) (purified by dialysis). Levels of GTP in samples were determined by integrating photon counts over 10 min and subtracting counts obtained for a control sample in which Y13-259 anti-Ras antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation. The amount of GDP was determined by equilibrium conversion of GDP and radioactive ATP to ADP and radioactive GTP using NDP kinase, with subsequent separation of GTP and ATP by TLC. 5 μl of sample was reacted with 250 fmol of unlabeled ATP, 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (purified by TLC), and 25 milliunits of NDP kinase in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2 (15 μl total reaction volume) for 90 min at 37 °C. 10 μl of each reaction mixture was spotted onto a plastic-backed cellulose TLC plate (Baker). After being developed as in (36Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of Ras is transient in fibroblasts, achieving a maximum after only 2 min or so of EGFR stimulation (28Osterop A.P.R.M. Medema R.H. van der Zon G.C.M. Bos J.L. Moller W. Maassen J.A. Eur.

On the other hand, trafficking of the EGFR between the surface and intracellular compartments requires about 20 min to reach a quasi-steady state in NR6 WT cells (32Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A.

Although receptor internalization may play a role in the deactivation of Ras, it is also known that a MEK-dependent feedback loop, acting downstream of receptor activation and upstream of Ras activation, is a potent regulatory mechanism in this pathway (23de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Pronk G.J. Medema J.P. Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 919-925PubMed Google Scholar, 24Langlois W.J. Sasaoka T. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

In order to deconvolute the potential contributions of the MEK-dependent negative feedback loop and EGFR trafficking to Ras deactivation in NR6 WT fibroblasts, the pharmacological agent PD098059 (34Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) was employed to block the former mechanism; this inhibitor selectively binds to MEK and prevents its activation by Raf. PD098059 affects biological responses of NR6 WT cells to EGF with an apparent IC50 of approximately 10 μm (13Xie H. Pallero A. Gupta K. Ware M.F. Chang P. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Illrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 616-625Google Scholar). The agent was therefore expected to prolong activation of Ras, as it does in other fibroblast lines. To confirm this, an assay that assesses Ras guanine nucleotide exchange was used, as this activity is the proposed target of MEK-dependent desensitization. NR6 WT cells were permeabilized with digitonin, in the presence of [α-32P]GTP, and Ras-associated radioactivity was immunoprecipitated. After 2 min of maximal (20 nm) EGF stimulation, a 3.6-fold increase in Ras-specific GNP exchange was observed (after subtracting nonspecific cpm) (Fig.2). This is in agreement with translocation of exchange activity (measured in vitro) to the plasma membrane in NR6 WT, which is elevated about 3-fold after 2 min stimulation (38Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Bai F. Rose D.W. Leitner J.W. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Gill G.N. Kobayashi M. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8338-8344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After 20 min of EGF stimulation, GNP exchange activity decreased to nearly the basal level, consistent with the desensitization of Ras activation seen in other fibroblast lines. However, treatment with PD098059 led to maintenance of elevated Ras-GNP exchange activity (2.8-fold above basal) after 20 min (Fig. 2). PD098059 had no effect on the basal activity (data not shown). Thus, on the time scale of EGFR trafficking, Ras activation is desensitized in a MEK-dependent manner in NR6 WT cells. We previously demonstrated that the EGFR remains maximally tyrosine-phosphorylated after internalization of EGF, but not TGFα, in NR6 WT cells (32Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This was shown using both pH 3 dissociation of surface-bound ligand and clearance of surface-biotinylated proteins from anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates. The difference in internal receptor activation was not surprising, because TGFα exhibits a much lower affinity than EGF for the EGFR at the acidic pH typically found in sorting endosomes (6French A.R.

The mechanism by which it differentiates between secretory and cytosolic proteins is poorly understood. To identify its binding motif, we screened 2688 peptides covering sequences of 23 proteins for SecB binding. The motif is ∼9 residues long and is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, whereas acidic residues are disfavored. Its identification allows the prediction of binding regions within protein sequences with up to 87% accuracy. SecB-binding regions occur statistically every 20–30 residues. The occurrence and affinity of binding regions are similar in SecB-dependent and -independent secretory proteins and in cytosolic proteins, and SecB lacks specificity toward signal sequences. SecB cannot thus differentiate between secretory and non-secretory proteins via its binding specificity. This conclusion is supported by the finding that SecB binds denatured luciferase, thereby allowing subsequent refolding by the DnaK system.

The principles governing substrate selection by SecB are controversial. Based on their finding that, in vitro, SecB has 100-fold higher affinity for denatured signal sequence containing MBP precursor than for the corresponding mature protein, Watanabe and Blobel (19Watanabe M. Blobel G. Cell. 1989; 58: 695-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, signal sequences were dispensable for association of SecB with other substrates, including MBP, both in vitro (25Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Suciu D. Hardy S.J.S.

Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3277-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) postulated a kinetic partitioning model, according to which SecB does not bind specifically to the signal sequence, but to various segments of the precursor polypeptide. The role of the signal sequence in this model is to reduce the folding rate of newly synthesized precursors to allow association with SecB. The refolding rate of unfolded MBP is indeed faster in the absence than in the presence of the signal sequence (30Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and SecB is unable to associate with refolding mature MBP unless a mutation in mature MBP is introduced that slows down the folding rate without affecting the thermostability of the folded protein. This kinetic partitioning model has been challenged by stopped-flow kinetic measurements of SecB interactions with denatured bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and barnase (32Fekkes P. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Association of SecB with these substrates is nearly diffusion-limited and therefore orders of magnitude faster than folding of newly synthesized polypeptides with or without signal sequences. Since the folding rates of newly synthesized proteins are in any case slower than the SecB association rate, they cannot therefore account for the ability of SecB to discriminate between cytosolic and exported proteins as required for the kinetic partitioning model. Recognition of high affinity binding sites in the precursor polypeptide might thus be a more important determinant for SecB substrate specificity than the folding rate of the substrate (32Fekkes P. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sequence motif that is recognized by SecB is poorly understood. In the case of MBP (34Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), GBP (35Khisty V.J. Munske G.R. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25920-25927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and OppA (36Smith V.F. Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1746-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), SecB binds to multiple fragments covering a large fraction (∼50%) of the primary sequence. The SecB tetramer has a binding site for positively charged peptides, the occupation of which is proposed to result in conformational changes that expose hydrophobic binding sites (37Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We determined the substrate specificity of SecB by screening cellulose membrane-coupled peptide scans of protein sequences for SecB binding as well as the potential of SecB to assist the folding of non-secretory proteins. These approaches allowed us to elucidate principles of action of this chaperone. The secB gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using chromosomal DNA as template and cloned downstream of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-regulatable promoter of the pREP4 expression plasmid. Overexpression of secB was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the cell culture grown in double-concentrated Luria broth medium. About 30 g of wet bacterial cells obtained from 5 liters of fermentation broth was resuspended on ice in 140 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 5 mm ε-aminocaproic acid; 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 0.1 mm o-phenanthroline, 0.1 mm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, 50 μm E-64, 10 μm leupeptin, and 100 units/ml aprotinin. After supplementation with 1.4 mg of DNase (10 μg/ml) and 14 mg of lysozyme (100 μg/ml), cells were sonified for 10 min (Branson sonifier, medium rod, 50% cycle, 20 watts). After opening of cells by sonication, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. SecB was precipitated from the supernatant by addition of ammonium sulfate up to 35% relative saturation, resolubilized in 50 mm piperazine-HCl (pH 5.0) (piperazine buffer), and then extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. After filtration through a 0.45-μm pore-sized filter, the solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.6 × 15 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with piperazine buffer. After washing, bound material was eluted by a salt gradient. Fractions containing SecB as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were pooled; adjusted to pH 7.4; and then applied to a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (2.6 × 100 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 140 mm NaCl (∼100 mg of SecB load/run). Fractions containing purified SecB were pooled and stored frozen at −80 °C. About 100 mg of homogeneous SecB was obtained from 1 liter of fermentation broth. Ion spray mass spectroscopy, N-terminal sequencing, and amino acid analysis verified the authenticity of the purified protein. Recombinant SecB started with serine at the amino terminus and was not blocked, in contradiction to what was reported earlier (20Weiss J.B. Ray P.H. Bassford Jr., P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8978-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2728-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purified SecB was protected against proteinase K cleavage by reduced andS-carboxyamidomethylated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) or by the peptides melittin, mastoparan, or bradykinin as described (37Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At concentrations below 0.7 g/liter, SecB formed an equilibrium between tetramers and monomers as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (21Schönfeld H.-J. Behlke J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The SecB mutants L75Q and E77K were purified as described previously (39Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. van der Wolk J.P.W.

A stock solution of firefly luciferase (Sigma; 64 μm in 1m glycylglycine (pH 7.4)) was diluted 6.4-fold into unfolding buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m guanidinium chloride) and denatured by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. Denatured luciferase was diluted to an 80 nm final concentration into refolding buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm ATP) containing 800 nm DnaK, 160 nm DnaJ, and 200 nm(GrpE)2 where indicated. Aliquots of 1 μl were diluted into 125 μl of assay buffer (25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm ATP) and analyzed for bioluminescence activity in a Biolumat (Berthold) as described previously (40Schröder H.

Peptides were C-terminally attached to cellulose via a (β-Ala)2 spacer. Peptides were derived from protein sequences of E. coli (GBP, LamB, MBP, OmpA, OmpF, alkaline phosphatase, β-lactamase, outer membrane lipoprotein, ribose-binding protein, FtsZ, SecA, ς32, and ribosomal protein L2),Saccharomyces cerevisiae (cytochromeb 2, ATP synthase β-chain (F1β), prepro-α-factor, and ATP synthase protein 9 (Su9)), pig (citrate synthase), cattle (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor), mouse (dihydrofolate reductase), Photinus pyralis (luciferase), and bacteriophage λ (λCI and λO). Before screening, the dry membranes were washed for 10 min in methanol and 3 × 20 min in Tris-buffered saline (31 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 170 mm NaCl, and 6.4 mm KCl). SecB (200 nm) was allowed to react with peptide scans in MP2 buffer (31 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% sucrose) for 40 min at 25 °C with gentle shaking. Unbound SecB was removed with Tris-buffered saline (4 °C), and peptide-bound SecB was electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) as described (44Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were sandwiched between blotting papers soaked with XK buffer (75 mm Tris base, 120 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 0.01% SDS) and the anode buffers XA1 (90 mm Tris base) and XA2 (300 mm Tris base) kept at 4 °C. Transferred SecB was detected by SecB-specific polyclonal rabbit sera, an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, and enhanced chemifluorescence measurement (ECF kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a fluoroimaging system (FLA2000, Fuji). Quantification was performed using TINA 2.10g (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany), and the relative intensities have been normalized to the averaged signal of the reference peptides AKTLILSHLRFVV, VVHIARNYAGYG, and QRKLFFNLRKTKQ, which was set as 100. Peptides were grouped into four SecB-binding classes relative to this signal (class 1, high affinity, relative SecB affinity value of ≥43.5; class 2, medium affinity, <43.5 and ≥16.5; class 3, low affinity, <16.5 and ≥4.5; and class 4, no affinity, <4.5). To elucidate the substrate specificity of SecB, we investigated the degree of specialization of SecB for secretory proteins. We tested in vitro whether SecB has the capability to assist folding of non-secretory proteins using firefly luciferase as substrate. Luciferase is cytosolic when produced in E. coliand requires the activity of the DnaK chaperone system for efficient refolding after thermal or chemical denaturation (40Schröder H. Langer T.

Biol. 1996; 261: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Guanidinium-denatured luciferase did not refold spontaneously or in the presence of bovine serum albumin (Fig.1). SecB, even when added at a 20-fold molar excess of the SecB tetramer over luciferase, did not affect the rate of spontaneous refolding. In contrast, when DnaK and its co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE (at a 10:2:5-fold molar excess over luciferase) were present in refolding buffer at time 0 when luciferase was added, luciferase refolded with a high rate to ∼80% of the native control. The simultaneous presence of SecB at an even higher concentration (25-fold molar excess) did not affect the rate and yield of luciferase refolding, indicating that SecB does not interfere with the chaperone activity of the DnaK system. However, at this high concentration (25-fold molar excess over luciferase), SecB was capable of preventing aggregation of denatured luciferase for at least 1 h as measured by light scattering (data not shown). Although it is a high concentration, it is still below the physiological concentration of SecB (∼13 μmtetramer). 2E. Schaffitzel, unpublished data. To test whether SecB can cooperate with the DnaK system in luciferase refolding, we performed order-of-addition experiments (Fig. 1) in which the DnaK system was added 20 min after addition of luciferase to the refolding mixture. In the absence of SecB, this late addition reduced the refolding yield to ∼25% of the maximal value due to aggregation of luciferase. Increasing concentrations of SecB present at time 0 steadily increased the rate and yield of luciferase refolding by the DnaK system (added at 20 min), with the highest refolding yield obtained at a 50-fold molar excess of SecB tetramer over luciferase (Fig. 1). The refolding yields were higher when DnaK was added already at 10 min after addition of luciferase (data not shown), indicating that SecB holds luciferase in a folding-competent state for only a limited time. These experiments indicate that SecB can act as a “holder” chaperone that prevents aggregation and that cooperates with DnaK in refolding of a non-native cytosolic protein. To determine the binding motif within protein sequences recognized by SecB, we screened cellulose-bound peptide scans (48Reineke U. Sabat R. Kramer A. Stigler R.-D. Seifert M. Michel T. Volk H. Schneider-Mergener J. Mol. Diversity. 1995; 1: 141-148Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) representing the complete sequences of 23 proteins for SecB binding. The peptide scans were composed of 13-mer peptides that overlap by 10 residues and therefore present all potential linear binding sites for SecB. A subset contains secretory proteins represented in the library as precursors with signal sequences. They are either prokaryotic proteins translocated in a SecB-dependent (GBP, LamB, MBP, OmpA, and OmpF) or -independent (alkaline phosphatase, β-lactamase, outer membrane lipoprotein, and ribose-binding protein) manner or eukaryotic proteins translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and prepro-α-factor) or mitochondria (citrate synthase, cytochrome b 2, ATP synthase β-chain (F1β), and ATP synthase protein 9 (Su9)). For comparison, a subset of non-secretory proteins was screened (dihydrofolate reductase, FtsZ, luciferase, SecA, ς32, L2, λCI, and λO). They were incubated with SecB to equilibrium, followed by electrotransfer and immunodetection of the chaperone. Fig. 2shows selected peptide scans. SecB bound only to a subset of the peptides, indicating that it differentiates between amino acid side chains. It bound frequently to neighboring peptides in the scan, indicating that a SecB-binding site is shared by these peptides. SecB-binding peptides existed in all peptide scans tested, with no apparent clustering within the scans (e.g. at N or C termini). Sequence alignment of overlapping binding peptides allowed definition of SecB-binding regions (see below). These occurred frequently, every 20–30 residues within the protein sequences tested. This frequency was not affected by cellular and organellar origin, size, and oligomeric status of the proteins and did not differ between secretory and non-secretory and homologous and heterologous proteins. SecB thus has broad substrate-binding specificity at the peptide level, which by itself cannot differentiate between substrates and non-substrates. The SecB mutants L75Q and E77K associate with precursor polypeptides, but are deficient in SecA interaction (39Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. van der Wolk J.P.W. Kimsey H.H. Kumamoto C.A. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We compared the specificity of these mutants with wild-type SecB for association with 76 peptides derived from the λCI sequence and found identical binding patterns (data not shown). This suggests that the SecB peptide-binding site is different from the SecA recognition site. The large data set allowed reliable statistical analysis of the substrate motif recognized by SecB. All screened peptides were grouped into four classes according to their affinity for SecB (high, medium, low, and no affinity) as determined by fluoroimager quantification of the SecB signals (Fig. 3 A). The relative occurrence of the 20 amino acids in the peptide library is similar to what is found in natural proteins, except for a low representation of Cys (44Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Substantial differences existed between the amino acid distribution of SecB-binding and non-binding peptides (Fig. 3 B). Medium affinity SecB-binding peptides are enriched in basic residues (Arg and Lys). High affinity SecB binders are, in addition, up to 2-fold enriched in aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, and Trp). Acidic residues (Asp and Glu) are strongly disfavored, and most other residues are slightly disfavored. Large hydrophobic residues (Ile, Leu, and Val) are not enriched. 94 regions with high affinity for SecB were aligned to identify the consensus binding motif. It consists of ∼9 neighboring residues, as judged from the fact that a continuous stretch of that length showed significant changes in amino acid composition compared with the total library. The binding motif is enriched in basic and aromatic residues, whereas acidic residues are disfavored unless localized in the neighborhood of basic residues (Fig.4). The relative enrichment of aromatic residues in SecB-binding peptides is lower compared with the enrichment of hydrophobic residues in DnaK-binding peptides (44Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This is a consequence of the lower abundance in the peptide library of aromatic residues (8.1%) as compared with hydrophobic residues (26%). SecB-binding regions contain each at least 3 aromatic or basic residues. The presence of each acidic residue in a SecB-binding region has to be compensated by another basic residue. Furthermore, in the absence of aromatic residues, at least four net positive charges are required. The positioning of charged and aromatic residues within the motif is not important, except that 2 aromatic residues in the direct neighborhood do not contribute more to SecB affinity as compared with only 1 residue. We compared the presence of these identified features of the motif within SecB-binding regions with the experimental data of five peptide scans comprising 2209 amino acids (alkaline phosphatase, LamB, luciferase, MBP, and OmpA) (Table I). These features existed in 79% of the 53 high affinity binding regions if the considered consecutive stretch between basic and aromatic residues had a length of up to 9 residues, and only four predicted regions were not high affinity binders (Table I). In the case of a length of up to 10 residues, the prediction of correctly identified regions increased to 87%, with seven incorrect predictions of SecB-binding regions. Together, the identified motif allows a precise description of SecB-binding regions in protein sequences.Table IPrediction of high affinity SecB-binding regions in five protein sequencesMaximum length of predicted regions9 residues10 residuesTotal regions Experimentally determined53 (100%)1-aValues in parentheses represent percentage of the total number of experimentally determined high affinity SecB-binding regions.53 (100%) Predicted4653Correct predicted regions42 (79%)46 (87%)False predicted regions4 (8%)7 (13%)High affinity SecB-binding regions were predicted as consecutive peptide sequences of 9 or 10 residues according to the following rules.

The molecular mechanisms regulating phenotypic modulation are unknown. Previous studies have suggested that the serine/threonine protein kinase mediator of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) promotes modulation to the contractile phenotype in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). Because of the potential importance of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways in VSMC proliferation and phenotypic modulation, the effects of PKG expression in PKG-deficient and PKG-expressing adult RASMC on MAP kinases were examined. In PKG-expressing adult RASMC, 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP activated extracellular signal- regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The major effect of PKG activation was increased activation by MAP kinase kinase (MEK). The cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP inhibited ERK1/2 activation in PKG-deficient and PKG-expressing RASMC but had no effect on JNK activity. The effects of PKG on ERK and JNK activity were additive with those of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), suggesting that PKG activates MEK through a pathway not used by PDGF. The stimulatory effects of cGMP on ERK and JNK activation were also observed in low-passaged, contractile RASMC still expressing endogenous PKG, suggesting that the effects of PKG expression were not artifacts of cell transfections. These results suggest that in contractile adult RASMC, NO-cGMP signaling increases MAP kinase activity.

NO stimulates the production of cyclic GMP (14Gruetter C.A. Barry B.K. McNamara D.B. Kadowitz P.J. Ignarro L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 214: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar), which, in turn, regulates several functions of VSMC such as smooth muscle relaxation (15Lincoln T.M. Cyclic GMP: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Pathophysiology. Landes Inc., Austin, TX1994Google Scholar). The major receptor protein for cGMP in VSMC is cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of important proteins that regulate intracellular Ca2+ levels and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (16Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1146-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that PKG also plays a major role in the regulation of the phenotype and morphology of VSMC (17Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression of PKG is highly variable in VSMC. When adult rat aortic SMC are subcultured in vitro, PKG expression is reduced to nearly undetectable levels (16Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1146-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cornwell T.L. Soff G.A. Traynor A.E. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Coincident with the loss of expression of PKG, VSMC assume the more synthetic phenotype. Transfection of the PKG-deficient VSMC with cDNAs encoding either PKG Iα or the catalytic domain of type I PKG reverted the morphology from synthetic to the original contractile morphology (17Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases are important mediators of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus, thereby regulating several cellular responses such as growth and differentiation (20Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 21Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that it is the duration of the MAP kinase activation that determines whether a stimulus evokes proliferation or differentiation (28Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Three distinct MAP kinase pathways have been identified in mammalian cells: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 kinase. MAP kinases are activated upon phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues by the dual function kinase MAP kinase kinase or MEK (mitogen-activated extracellular-regulated protein kinase kinase). The various MEKs are themselves activated by serine phosphorylation. In the case of the MEK that activates ERKs, phosphorylation on serine by Raf kinase is the first step in ERK activation. Using constitutively active and nonactive mutants of MEK, it was demonstrated that activation of MEK was necessary and sufficient for PC12 differentiation and transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (27Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). The two isoforms of ERK, p42 and p44 (ERK2 and ERK1, respectively), are present in adult contractile mammalian VSMC at relatively high concentrations (24Watson M.H. Venance S.L. Pang S.P. Mak A.S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Adam L.P. Gapinski C.J. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Childs T.J.

Yokoyama M.C.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that ERK1 and -2 are partially activated in fully differentiated contractile smooth muscle by contractile agonists (29Adam L.P. Gapinski C.J. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Khalil R.A. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C406-C411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Katoch S.S. Moreland R.S. Am.

Several reports suggest that ERK activation may be involved in regulating contraction of differentiated smooth muscle (35Adam L.P. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 167-177Crossref Google Scholar), but others have found only small effects of ERK activation on contraction (34Gorenne I. Su X. Moreland R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H131-H138PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the MAP kinase pathway may be involved in other functions besides the regulation of proliferation in fully contractile smooth muscle cells. Hence, it is possible that MAP kinase activation is regulatory in phenotypic modulation. Because PKG itself appears to be important for the expression of the VSMC contractile phenotype, it was of interest to examine the effects of PKG expression on MAP kinase pathways in VSMC compared with VSMC that do not express PKG. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that PKG activation increases the expression of a number of protooncogene transcription factors in a variety of cell types (36Dhaunsi G.S. Hassid A.

In particular, increased expression of c-fosand Jun-B in response to PKG activation may underlie the increases in VSMC proliferation observed by some investigators (41Hassid A. Arabshahi H.

RASMC were isolated from the thoracic and abdominal aortas of adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g, Harlan) as described previously (16Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol.

Rats were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and aortae were excised and placed in a wash medium of DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The aortae were cleaned and placed in digestion medium (wash medium containing 1 mg/ml elastase and 130 units/ml collagenase) for 8 min. The tunicae adventitiae were removed, and the medial layers were minced and further digested for 1–2 h in digestion medium containing 200 units/ml collagenase until a single-cell suspension was obtained. Cells were washed twice with the wash medium and plated in culture dishes. Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin and grown under 10% CO2 and subcultured every 6 days.

The precipitate was added to the cell monolayer, and the cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2. The transfection was terminated by adding DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum. Stably transfected cells were selected using 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418). After isolating the colonies, the transfected cell lines were maintained in 250 μg/ml G418. The transfected cells from passage 6–12 were used for the experiments. For the experiments reported here, at least three different clones of cells expressing physiological levels of PKG and three different clones of cells transfected with empty vector and not expressing PKG were examined, as reported previously (17Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells plated in 60 mm culture dishes and grown to confluence were serum-deprived in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 24 h, treated with various agents in serum-free medium for different time intervals, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were harvested by scraping in 0.25–0.5 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin A, and 10 nm caliculyn A), rotated for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were separated, and protein contents were estimated by using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The activity of JNK was measured by an immunocomplex kinase assay using an antibody specific for JNK-1 (PharMingen, clone G 151–333) and c-Jun (amino acids 5–89) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST c-Jun) as the substrate as described previously (44Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). 200 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated with anti JNK-1 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with Protein G-agarose beads. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with the extraction buffer followed by two washes with JNK assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmdithiothreitol). The immunocomplexes were further incubated in 20 μl of JNK assay buffer containing GST-c-Jun (5 μg/sample), 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 8 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of a 5× electrophoresis stop buffer (312.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.9, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 m sucrose, 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.8m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and the denatured proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and subjected to autoradiography. The radioactivity incorporated into the phosphorylated GST-c-Jun protein bands was quantitated by scintillation counting and by densitometry of the autoradiogram. Cell lysates (10–50 μg of protein) from the treated samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, protein transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with antibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, p38, JNK-1, and MEK1/2. As a control, the amount of total ERK1/2 protein, p38 protein, JNK-1 protein, and MEK1/2 protein was determined by using antibodies that are specific to total ERK1/2, p38, JNK-1, and MEK1/2, respectively. PKG was detected using goat anti-bovine type I PKG prepared in our laboratory or purchased from StressGen. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce). The intensity of the bands was quantitated by densitometry. Experiments were performed a minimum of three times, and the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. and analyzed by Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was used as the criterion of significance. It was demonstrated earlier that the level of PKG decreases with each passage when adult RASMC are cultured in vitro (16Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol.

Similar results have been reported by other laboratories for adult rat aortic and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (13Chiche J.-D. Schlutsmeyer S.M. Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M.

On the other hand, RASMC isolated from juvenile animals have been reported to maintain PKG expression under certain plating and growth conditions (46Brown C. Pan X. Hassid A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to ensure that PKG expression was suppressed for the studies described below, cells were isolated from adult animals and passaged several times. The lack of PKG expression was also examined by Western blot analysis, Northern blot analysis, and enzymatic assay. Any non-transfected cell lines still expressing PKG were excluded from these studies. Transfection of RASMC with either the cDNA encoding PKG Iα or the catalytic domain of PKG-I in passages 3–5 reversed the morphology of the cells to a more contractile phenotype (17Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the morphology of RASMC stably expressing physiological levels of PKG Iα compared with control transfected not expressing PKG. The RASMC transfected with the empty vector had a synthetic morphology as demonstrated by the flattened appearance and the irregular growth pattern (panel A), whereas the RASMC transfected with pcDNA1-neo/PKG Iα had a contractile morphology as demonstrated by the spindle-shaped appearance and “hill and valley” growth pattern (panel B). Similar results were obtained by transfection of the catalytic domain (data not shown). To determine whether the phenotypic changes were associated with alterations in MAP kinase expression, RASMC deficient in PKG and those expressing PKG Iα were used to study the activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. Fig. 2 demonstrates the levels of protein expression for these MAP kinases along with PKG expression in transfected RASMC. It is important to note the absence of detectable PKG expression in RASMC transfected with the empty vector. No PKG was detected by Western blot analysis when up to 50 μg of soluble protein were probed using either a polyclonal, immunopurified anti-PKG generated in our own laboratory or an antibody purchased fromStressGen. It is also important to note that the loss of PKG expression in passaged adult rat VSMC has been found by at least three other laboratories independent of our own (13Chiche J.-D. Schlutsmeyer S.M. Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M. Roberts Jr., J.D. Fillippov G. Janssens S.P. Rosenzweig A. Bloch K.D. J. Biol.

There were no significant differences in the levels of JNK and p38 kinases in these two cell types.Figure 2Expression of MAP kinases and PKG Iα in vector-transfected (C) and PKG-transfected (1α) RASMC . Shown is a representative Western blot for p38, ERK1/2, JNK-1, and PKG Iα in extracts from vector alone-transfected RASMC and PKG Iα-transfected RASMC (1α). 10–50 μg of total protein were prepared and analyzed by Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures” using antibodies specific for these kinases. Thearrows indicate the kinases at their respective molecular sizes. The band above the 46-kDa JNK1 is a related 54–55-kDa JNK isoform.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Empty vector- and PKG Iα-transfected cells were treated with an analog of cGMP, 8-CPT-cGMP, for different time intervals. Fig. 3 is the time course of activation of ERK1/2 by cGMP in vector only (lanes 1–4) and PKG Iα-transfected RASMC (lanes 5–8). Compared with empty vector-transfected cells, the untreated (time 0) RASMC transfected with PKG Iα demonstrated increased activation of ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2, lane 5 compared with lane 1). Greater levels of ERK in the PKG-expressing cells did not appear to account for the increased levels of phospho-ERK, suggesting that the basal activation state of ERK is greater in PKG-expressing cells (panel B). 8-CPT-cGMP increased ERK1/2 activity at 15, 30, and 60 min with peak increases by cGMP observed at 15 min. On the other hand, no significant increases in ERK1/2 activation by 8-CPT-cGMP were observed in the vector alone-transfected cells. The statistical analysis of ERK1/2 activation in PKG-deficient and PKG-expressing cells is shown in panel D of Fig.3. The effects of PKG Iα transfection and 8-CPT-cGMP on ERK1/2 activity were reproducibly observed in three different clonally isolated cells expressing PKG compared with three different clonally isolated cells transfected with empty vector. We had previously described the controls performed to ensure that the results observed with PKG expression were not artifacts associated with the transfection and isolation procedure itself (17Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results observed were not due to unique characteristics of a particular cell type derived from a lone colony of RASMC, but rather reflected the consequences of PKG expression in the RASMC. Fig. 3 (panel E) is a time course of activation of JNK in PKG-deficient and PKG-expressing cells. As shown in the panel, cGMP also activates JNK kinase as represented by GST-cJun phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated JNK (vector only cells,lanes 1–4 and PKG Iα cells, lanes 5–8). Compared with empty vector-transfected cells, the untreated control (time 0) from the PKG-Iα RASMC had an increased activity of JNK. 8-CPT-cGMP increased JNK activation at 15 min in the PKG-expressing cells but had no significant effects on JNK activation in the PKG-deficient cells. The total level of JNK protein in these two cell lines was not significantly different (panel F), and the statistical analysis of the data for JNK activation by 8-CPT-cGMP is shown in panel G. PKG transfection and 8-CPT-cGMP had no significant stimulatory effects on p38 kinase in the PKG-expressing cells compared with the PKG-deficient cells (data not shown) and was not studied further. Panel C in Fig. 3 illustrates the level of PKG in the vector alone-transfected cells (lanes 1-4) and the PKG Iα-transfected cells (lanes 5–8). Again, it is important to note the lack of detectable expression of PKG-I in vector alone-transfected adult RASMC. Sorbitol is an osmotically stressful agent to cultured cells that is known to activate MAP kinase pathways. Sorbitol significantly activated both ERK1/2 and JNK in vector alone-transfected RASMC (panels A and C and the statistical analysis in panel D in Fig.4). In PKG-expressing RASMC, sorbitol increased JNK activation more potently than did 8-CPT-cGMP. In these same cells, however, sorbitol was not more potent in increasing ERK1/2 than was 8-CPT-cGMP. The total increase in JNK activation by sorbitol in PKG-deficient and PKG-expressing cells was similar. Growth factors such as PDGF activate MAP kinases through both Ras-dependent pathways and G-protein coupled pathways in smooth muscle cells (47Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To gain fu"

They existin planta as both the aglycone and glycosyl conjugates. We identified a flavonol 3-O-galactosyltransferase (F3GalTase) that is expressed exclusively in the male gametophyte and controls the formation of a pollen-specific class of glycosylated flavonols. Thus an essential step to understanding flavonol-induced germination is the characterization of F3GalTase. Amino acid sequences of three peptide fragments of F3GalTase purified from petunia pollen were used to isolate a full-length cDNA clone. RNA gel blot analysis and enzyme assays confirmed that F3GalTase expression is restricted to pollen. Heterologous expression of the F3GalTase cDNA inEscherichia coli yielded active recombinant enzyme (rF3GalTase) which had the identical substrate specificity as the native enzyme. Unlike the relatively nonspecific substrate usage of flavonoid glycosyltransferases from sporophytic tissues, F3GalTase uses only UDP-galactose and flavonols to catalyze the formation of flavonol 3-O-galactosides. Kinetic analysis showed that thek cat/K m values of rF3GalTase, using kaempferol and quercetin as substrates, approaches that of a catalytically perfect enzyme. rF3GalTase catalyzes the reverse reaction, generation of flavonols from UDP and flavonol 3-O-galactosides, almost as efficiently as the forward reaction.

Subsequent reactions give rise to the various classes of flavonoids which differ in the oxidation state of the central pyran ring and by modifications such as glycosylation, acylation, and methylation to the three rings (1Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids: Advances in Research Since 1986. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1994: 499-535Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Flavonoids perform a variety of functions including protection from ultraviolet light (2Li J. Ou-Lee T.-M. Raba R. Amundson R.G. Last R.L. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 171-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), signaling between leguminous roots and nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria (3Burn J. Rossen L. Johnston A.W.B. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 456-464Crossref Google Scholar), and the visible anthocyanin pigments in flowers attract pollinators (4Harborne J.B. Bell E.A. Charlwood B.V. Secondary Plant Products. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1980: 329-395Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, an essential role in plant reproduction was established for the flavonol class (Fig. 1) (5Mo Y. Nagel C. Taylor L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7213-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In flowering plants when pollen germinates on a receptive stigma it extrudes a tube which rapidly grows by apical extension to transport the sperm cells to the embryo sac for fertilization. Chalcone synthase mutants in maize and petunia produced viable pollen which lacked flavonols and was unable to germinate or produce a functional pollen tube. However, the mutant pollen was conditionally male fertile (CMF)1 (6Taylor L.P. Jorgensen R. J. Hered. 1992; 83: 11-17Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar); it could be biochemically complemented by adding flavonols such as kaempferol or quercetin to the stigma at pollination or to a suspension of the mutant pollen in germination medium (5Mo Y. Nagel C. Taylor L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7213-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The latter procedure was the basis of an in vitro bioassay that was used to demonstrate that the germination response was rapid (tube outgrowth was observed within 5 min), sensitive (0.4 μm kaempferol elicits the maximum response), and specific for flavonols (5Mo Y. Nagel C. Taylor L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7213-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 8Vogt T. Wollenweber E. Taylor L.P. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 589-592Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Flavonols are synthesized in the tapetal cells of the anther wall, released into the anther locule and taken up by the developing pollen grain where they are glycosylated. Wild-type petunia pollen accumulates 2 flavonol glycosides, the 3-O-(2′′-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-β-d-galactopyranoside conjugates of kaempferol and quercetin (7Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Zerback R. Bokel M. Geiger H. Hess D. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 897-899Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 1 → 2 interglycosidic linkage is common in pollen (10Markham K.R. Campos M. Phytochemistry. 1996; 43: 763-767Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but rare in sporophytic tissues such as petunia corollas which accumulate an entirely different flavonol conjugate, flavonol rhamnosyl 1 → 6 glucoside (11Wiering H. de Vlaming P. Sink K.C. Petunia. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 49-68Google Scholar). When a suspension of CMF pollen is treated with kaempferol or quercetin to induce germination, the added flavonals are rapidly converted to glycosyl conjugates identical to those that accumulate in wild-type pollen (7Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Xu P. Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Planta. 1997; 202: 257-265Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Xu et al. (12Xu P. Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Planta. 1997; 202: 257-265Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) detected radiolabeled kaempferide 3-O-galactoside and kaempferide 3-O-glucosylgalactoside within 1 min of adding [14C]kaempferide, a flavonol that induces pollen germination as efficiently as kaempferol, to a suspension of CMF pollen. This study demonstrated that formation of the two flavonol glycosides preceded visible tube outgrowth and ruled out a structural role in cell wall formation for flavonols or their catabolites. The two enzyme activities responsible for formation of the pollen-unique class of flavonol glycosides were identified as a F3GalTase, which used UDP-galactose as a substrate to convert flavonols to the flavonol 3-O-galactosides, and a flavonol 3-O-galactoside-2”-O-glucosyltransferase (F2”GT) which transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to the 2” position of galactose to form the flavonol glucosylgalactoside (Fig. 1). Both glycosyltransferase activities were simultaneously extracted from pollen and catalyzed the formation of the flavonol diglycosidesin vitro (7Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that kaempferol, quercetin, and UDP-galactose were the only endogenous substrates of F3GalTase, and that the flavonol 3-O-galactoside is the only endogenous substrate that the F2”GT activity glucosylates (e.g. it does not glucosylate the flavonol). Importantly, formation of the flavonol 3-O-galactoside was a prerequisite to formation of the flavonol diglycoside (7Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is one of the final steps in flavonoid biosynthesis (1Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids: Advances in Research Since 1986. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1994: 499-535Google Scholar, 13Harborne J.B. Williams C.A. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids, Advances in Research Since 1980. Chapman and Hall, London1988: 303-328Google Scholar) and converts a chemically reactive molecule into a less reactive form. Presumably, the enhanced solubility of flavonoid glycosides aids their intracellular transport and sequestration (14Bandurski R.S. Cohen J.D. Slovin J. Reinecke D.M. Davies P.J. Plant Hormones: Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1995: 39-65Crossref Google Scholar,15Sembdner G. Atzorn R. Schneider G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1459-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although the cellular location of flavonol glycosides is unknown, another class of flavonoids, the anthocyanidin glucosides are targeted to the vacuole following conjugation with glutathione (16Marrs K.A. Alfenito M.R. Lloyd A.M. Walbot V. Nature. 1995; 375: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Glycosyl conjugation might also function to provide a reservoir of active molecules. The activity of plant growth regulators and other signal molecules is proposed to be regulated by interconversion between the active aglycone and the inactive glycosyl conjugate (15Sembdner G. Atzorn R. Schneider G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1459-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The alternative roles of glycosylation are not mutually exclusive and in the case of flavonols there is evidence for both. High levels of flavonols are cytotoxic (8Vogt T. Wollenweber E. Taylor L.P. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 589-592Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and flavonols induce germination but the glucosylgalactosides accumulate in pollen (5Mo Y. Nagel C. Taylor L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7213-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 8Vogt T. Wollenweber E. Taylor L.P. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 589-592Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Pollak P.E.

Plenum Press, New York1998: 35-44Google Scholar). We want to establish the mechanism by which flavonols induce pollen to germinate and the role of glycosyl conjugate formation in this process. F3GalTase activity was deemed to be a critical component of flavonol-mediated pollen germination because: 1) F3GalTase is the sole activity in petunia pollen that metabolizes flavonols; 2) formation of flavonol glucosylgalactosides in petunia pollen is strictly dependent on F3GalTase activity; and 3) F3GalTase activity, through its forward and reverse reactions, has the potential to modulate the abundance of the active molecule. We used a directed approach, exploiting amino acid sequences in the native protein, to isolate a F3GalTase cDNA clone. Heterologous expression of the F3GalTase cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in obtaining soluble, active F3GalTase which was used for biochemical characterization. The resulting information was used to construct a model of how F3GalTase activity might function during flavonol-induced pollen germination. Pollen from anthers of stage 2–9 flowers (17Pollak P.E. Vogt T. Mo Y. Taylor L.P. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) of the flavonoid-deficient line of Petunia hybrida, termed CMF, previously characterized by Taylor and Jorgensen (6Taylor L.P. Jorgensen R. J. Hered. 1992; 83: 11-17Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was used as a source of both native F3GalTase and total RNA for PCR and Northern blot analyses. RNA isolated from pollen, leaf, seedling, stigma/style, and corolla tissue was from the V26 inbred line, designated wild-type, of P. hybrida. The V26 and CMF petunia lines are genetically identical except for the presence of a chalcone synthase transgene in the CMF line (19Napoli C. Lemieux C. Jorgensen R. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 279-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flavonoids were purchased (Indofine, Extrasynthase), were from our laboratory collection, or were enzymatically synthesized (kaempferol- and quercetin 3-O-galactosides). Other compounds were purchased (Sigma) or were from our laboratory collection and included NAD+, ferrulic acid, sinapic acid, naphthylphthamic acid, and the plant growth regulators gibberillin, indole acetic acid, abscisic acid, and jasmonic acid. The HPLC system and gradients used to separate the flavonol glycosides from flavonols have been previously described (12Xu P. Vogt T. Taylor L.P. Planta. 1997; 202: 257-265Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all chromatography and desalting/concentration procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The fast protein liquid chromatography system used for chromatography of native F3GalTase is described in Shuttleworth et al. (20Shuttleworth W.A. Hough C.D. Bertrand K.P. Evans J.N.S.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) into a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm DTT. The released pollen was filtered through nylon mesh, pelleted at 1,800 × g (4 °C) for 5 min, resuspended in the same buffer and recentrifuged. The pollen, suspended in 250 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), was disrupted by 6 × 30-s pulses with chilled, silanized quartz beads in a bead mill (Biospec Products). F3GalTase activity in the crude homogenate was loaded, at 1 ml min−1, onto a preparative anion exchange chromatography column (Econo-Pac, 1 ml, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT at room temperature. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT and F3GalTase activity was eluted with 5 column volumes of the same buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. The eluate was desalted by ultrafiltration (Amicon) into 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT and F3GalTase activity was loaded onto a Mono-Q 16/10 preparative anion exchange chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated in the same buffer, at a flow rate of 3 ml min−1. The column was washed until the UV absorbance (280 nm) of the flow-through returned to the baseline level, and F3GalTase activity was eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m KCl in 90 min. Those fractions containing F3GalTase activity were pooled and desalted/concentrated by ultrafiltration as described previously. The desalted preparation was then loaded onto a Mono-Q HR 5/5 analytical anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT, washed as before, and then eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.35m KCl in 90 min at 1 ml min−1. Alternate fractions were analyzed for F3GalTase activity and those with the highest activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining to assess purity. These analyses demonstrated the enrichment of a protein migrating at about 45 kDa. The fractions containing the highest level of enzyme activity with the least amount of contaminating protein were pooled and desalted/concentrated to about 0.6 ml. To confirm that the 45-kDa protein was F3GalTase, a portion of the concentrated Mono-Q HR 5/5 eluate was subjected to affinity chromatography on 2 ml of UDP-diphosphohexanolamine-agarose matrices (Sigma) after desalting on a Sephadex G-25M PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into 5 mm MES-OH, pH 5.5, and 1 mm DTT. After extensive washing with the same buffer, F3GalTase activity was eluted in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT. For sequencing, 0.3 mg of the desalted/concentrated Mono-Q HR 5/5 eluate was purified by preparative SDS-PAGE through 1.5-mm gels (Mini-Protean II, Bio-Rad) and the 45-kDa peptide was localized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 45 kDa was excised and subjected to proteolytic digestion using Lys-C endopeptidase. The resulting peptide fragments were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and collected for N-terminal amino acid sequencing by automated Edman degradation. All manipulations following excision of the protein from the gel were performed at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility at Stanford University Medical Center. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript Lambda System (Life Technologies, Inc.) from 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from stage 6 CMF pollen. Size-fractionated cDNA (20 ng) was ligated into 0.5 μg ofNotI/SalI-digested ZipLox DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the resulting constructs were packaged in vitrousing the Gigapack II System (Stratagene). The library was amplified by plating on E. coli host strain Y1090 and contained 2.3 × 109 phage ml−1. To obtain a nucleotide probe for screening the petunia pollen cDNA library, a RACE PCR protocol (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) was performed using total RNA isolated from stage 6 pollen and the following primers in the 5′ to 3′ direction: primer 1, CTGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAGCTCTAGAACAAGC(T)17; 2, CTGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAG; 3, TCTCGAGCTCTAGAACAAGC; 4, AAYTTYITYAAYGTNGGNCC; 5, GTNGCNACNCCNCCNCC; 6, GGICCIACRTTIARRAARTTRTTRAA; 7, CAAATCACAGGCACACCAGC; 8, AACTTGTACTTGTGGTGCCC; 9, GCTAGTCGTGCATATGTCCAATTACCATG; 10, GGGTCAGCTCGAGTTAATTGCAAGAGTG. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed in 1× reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm DTT) containing 5 μg of total RNA, 10 units of RNasin, 25 pmol of primer 1, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 μl final volume. The reaction was incubated for 50 min at 45 °C and terminated by heating at 70 °C for 15 min. After cooling on ice, 2 units of E. coli RNase H was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. The RNase H-treated cDNA was diluted into 0.5 ml of TE buffer and stored at −80 °C. A 3′-RACE PCR product was generated using 3 μl of the cDNA as template, 25 pmol of primers 2 and 4, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 50 μl of reaction volume. The addition of the other components were as described by the manufacturer. The cycling parameters were: 2 min hot start at 94 °C, 5 min at 45 °C, 20 min at 72 °C, one cycle; 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 45 °C, 1.25 min at 72 °C, 35 cycles; final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. One μl of a 1:1000 dilution (in TE) of the reaction was used as template in a nested PCR experiment using 25 pmol of primers 3 and 5 and other reaction components as described previously. Cycling conditions were: 2 min hot start at 94 °C; 60 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 45 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, 30 cycles; final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The most abundant amplicon at about 600 bp was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli TOP10F competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The deduced peptide sequences from three of the five plasmids subjected to nucleotide sequencing contained all of peptide 3 and residues 14–20 of peptide 2 (Fig. 3). The deduced peptide sequence of the plasmid, designated pF3GalTase3′RACE, showed a high level of identity with flavonoid glucosyltransferase from cassava (22Hughes J. Hughes M.A. DNA Sequence. 1994; 5: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), grape (23Sparvoli F. Martin C. Scienza A. Gavazzi G. Tonelli C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and maize (24Furtek D. Schiefelbein J.W. Johnston F. Nelson O.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Ralston E.J. English J.J. Dooner H.K. Genetics. 1988; 119: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar). A 5′-RACE PCR product was obtained using 5 μg of total RNA from stage 6 pollen as described previously for the 3′-RACE protocol except that 10 pmol of primer 7 was used. Following RNase H treatment, the mixture was passed through Sephadex G-25 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), evaporated to 10 μl, and a poly(A) tail was added to the 5′ end of the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture was diluted into 250 μl of TE buffer and used as the 5′-RACE cDNA pool. PCR was performed on 3 μl of this cDNA using 10 pmol of primer 1 and 25 pmol of primers 2 and 8. Other components and the cycling parameters were as described previously for the nested 3′-RACE PCR experiment. A nested PCR experiment was conducted on 3 μl of a 1:100 dilution (in TE buffer) of the first 5′-RACE PCR experiment using the previously described components except that 25 pmol of primers 3 and 6 were used. The cycling conditions were: 2 min hot start at 94 °C; 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, every two cycles the annealing temperature was decreased by 2 °C until 48 °C was reached; 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 48 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, 15 cycles; final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The most abundant amplicon (∼700 bp) was cloned as described previously and the deduced amino acid sequence of the resulting 725-bp clone, designated as pF3GalTase5′RACE, contained residues 1–9 of peptide 2 and all residues of peptide 1 (Fig. 3). Approximately 1.0 × 105 plaque forming units of the previously described stage 6 petunia pollen cDNA library were plated onto E. coliY1090 host cells, the DNA transferred to nylon filters, and hybridized with the 5′-RACE PCR product labeled with [32P]dCTP. Positive plaques were purified by three rounds of plating and hybridization. In vivo excision of the pZIP plasmid from the phage in the positive plaques was unsuccessful so λ phage DNA was isolated and digested with NotI/SalI. The resulting restriction fragment (about 1.5 kbp) was gel purified and cloned into the pBluescript (SK+) phagemid (Stratagene) for sequence analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence from the resulting 1.431-kbp clone (pF3GalTase1) was determined to contain the sequences in peptides 1–3 (Fig. 3) as well as the nucleotide sequences comprising both the 3′ and 5′-RACE PCR products. Total RNA was extracted from anthers or pollen of stages 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 flowers as well as leaf, corolla, stigma/style, and seedling (shoot + root) tissues and 10–15 μg was subjected to RNA gel blot analysis. Hybridization and washing conditions are described in Guyon et al. 2V. Guyon, J. Astwood, and L. P. Taylor, submitted for publication. To quantify the expression of F3GalTase mRNA, the autoradiographs were scanned and analyzed by the NIH Image 1.62 software program. The mRNA signals were normalized to the rRNA signals and mRNA/rRNA ratios were calculated for each sample. The pF3GalTase1 plasmid was used as a template to generate a PCR product suitable for expression in E. coli. A 100-μl reaction used 5 units of native Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 10 ng of pF3GalTase1 plasmid, and 50 pmol of primers 9 and 10 at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The other reaction components and the cycling parameters were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for a 2.0-kbp template. The resulting amplicon was gel-purified, digested withNdeI/XhoI, ligated into pET28a (Novagen), and used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). For expression, the resulting plasmid (pETF3GalTase) in BL21(DE3) cells was grown at 37 °C in LB medium + 30 μg ml−1 kanamyacin to an OD600 = 0.4–0.6. The culture was adjusted to 22 °C and rF3GalTase expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 5.0 μm. The culture was incubated for at least 16 h at 22 °C (300 rpm) prior to harvesting the cells for rF3GalTase purification. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 m KCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mimidazole, 2.0 mg ml−1 lysozyme, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were thawed and after 5 min at room temperature, the lysate was adjusted to 5 mm MgCl2 and DNase was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1. The lysate was incubated for an additional 10 min and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min (4 °C). The supernatant was decanted and Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) was added (0.01 ml of the 50% slurry, as supplied by the manufacturer, per ml of lysate) and mixed with the lysate for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was pelleted by brief centrifugation, washed two times, and eluted with 0.2 m imidazole according to the manufacturer's instructions except that 1% Triton X-100 was included in the wash and elution buffers. The N-terminal 6× His-tag was then removed using thrombin at 10 units mg−1rF3GalTase, in elution buffer, at 4 °C for 16 h. To terminate the reaction, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm. rF3GalTase was diluted 10-fold in wash buffer, excluding the imidazole, and incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose resin as described previously for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation and rF3GalTase in the supernatant was quantified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). rF3GalTase activity in the forward direction was measured in 50 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 50 μm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 5 mm UDP-galactose, and 2.5 ng of purified rF3GalTase in a 50-μl final volume. The mixture was incubated at 43 °C for 3 min and the reaction was initiated by adding various concentrations of kaempferol or quercetin in dimethyl sulfoxide (final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration, 1%), and vortexed briefly to mix. After 3 min, the reaction was terminated with 2 volumes of 100% methanol and the assay mixture centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min. The amount of flavonol 3-O-galactoside in 50 μl of the supernatant was determined by HPLC. Quantification was performed by integrating the peak area and using the first order regression equation derived from calibration curves of kaempferol 3-O-galactoside and quercetin 3-O-galactoside standards. One unit of rF3GalTase activity is defined as that amount of enzyme which catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of flavonol 3-O-galactoside in 1 min using the described conditions. rF3GalTase activity in the reverse direction was measured as described previously except that 50 mm MES-Tris buffer, pH 6.0, and 5 mm UDP were used. The reaction was initiated by adding various concentrations of flavonol 3-O-galactoside (in dimethyl sulfoxide). The calibration curves for quantification of flavonols were based on kaempferol and quercetin standards. One unit of rF3GalTase activity in the reverse direction is defined as that amount of enzyme which catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of kaempferol or quercetin in 1 min using the described conditions. Anthocyanidins were assayed as potential substrates according to the method previously described (26Ford C.M. Boss P.K. Høj P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9224-9233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The activity of rF3GalTase in the forward direction was evaluated at temperatures from 35 to 60 °C using the previously described assay conditions except that the indicated temperatures were used. rF3GalTase activity in both the forward and reverse directions were evaluated from pH 4.5–9.0 using two buffer systems: MES-Pi (pH 4.5–6.5) and Tris-MES, pH 6.5–9.0. All other components in the assay mixture and reaction conditions were as described previously. Nondenaturing PAGE was used to calculate the native mass of purified rF3GalTase according to the method described by Hedrick and Smith (27Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). MW-ND-500 kit (Sigma) native standard proteins were used to construct the standard curve as described previously (Sigma Technical Bulletin MKR-137). The initial velocity versus substrate concentration curves for the rF3GalTase reaction in the forward direction were determined using a fixed UDP-galactose concentration of 5 mm and varying the concentration of flavonol from 1 to 25 μm, or using a fixed flavonol concentration of 25 μm and varying the concentration of UDP-galactose from 0.1 to 5 mm. For the rF3GalTase reaction in the reverse direction, a fixed UDP concentration of 5"

This response is characterized by a transient initial increase because of intracellular Ca2+ release followed by a sustained elevation which varies in amplitude depending on the nature of the stimulus. In contrast, low-level stimulation often evokes oscillatory changes in [Ca2+]i. The specific information provided by repetitive [Ca2+]i spikes appears to be encoded in the frequency rather than in the amplitude of [Ca2+]i oscillations. The specific, membrane-permeable inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) receptor blocker Xestospongin C (XeC, 2–20 μm) was used to affect [Ca2+]isignaling in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) during an established response to low-level (1 μm) histamine stimulation. XeC produced a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations during histamine stimulation without affecting oscillation amplitude. Histamine stimulated a 14-fold increase in NF-κB-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene activity that was dose-dependently decreased by XeC. Thus, during low-level agonist stimulation, [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency regulates nuclear transcription in HAEC.

[Ca2+]i oscillations may permit cells to respond to information provided by increases in [Ca2+]iwhile avoiding prolonged exposure to constantly elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The information provided by [Ca2+]i oscillations may be encoded in the frequency rather than in the amplitude of the oscillations (8Goldbeter A. Dupont G. Berridge M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

[Ca2+]i oscillations may enhance signaling efficiency at low, otherwise subthreshold levels of stimulation, when peak [Ca2+]i only periodically exceeds the threshold for activation. In cell-free experiments, the frequency of oscillatory changes in [Ca2+] has been shown to regulate the activity of Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (11De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The relationship between [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency and gene expression has heretofore only been examined under conditions in which [Ca2+]i oscillations have been generated and regulated “artificially” without agonist stimulation of membrane receptors (12Dolmetsch R.E.

In this report, we used the recently developed, specific, membrane-permeable Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor blocker Xestospongin C (XeC) (16Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F.

We found that a decrease in the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations during low-level histamine stimulation resulted in a parallel decrease in NF-κB activity. The regulation of nuclear transcriptional activity by the frequency of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations may provide cells with a specific mechanism to control gene expression during agonist stimulation. HAEC (Clonetics) were grown to passage 5–9 at ∼70% confluence on gelatin-coated, 25-mm diameter circular glass coverslips (VWR Scientific) (7Hu Q. Corda S. Zweier J.L. Capogrossi M.C. Ziegelstein R.C. Circulation. 1998; 97: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HAEC [Ca2+]i was measured after loading with 10 μm concentration of the acetoxymethyl ester form of indo 1 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature (7Hu Q. Corda S. Zweier J.L. Capogrossi M.C. Ziegelstein R.C. Circulation. 1998; 97: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Ziegelstein R.C. Cheng L. Blank P.S. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Hansford R.G.

Indo 1 fluorescence was recorded from single HAEC on the stage of a modified Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope after excitation at 350 ± 50 nm using a Xenon short arc lamp (Ushio Inc.). Bandpass interference filters (Omega Optical) selected wavelength bands of emitted fluorescence at 405 ± 10 and 485 ± 10 nm, corresponding to the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms of the indicator, respectively. The intracellular minimum and maximum ratios (R minand R max, respectively) were determined as described previously (17Ziegelstein R.C. Cheng L. Blank P.S. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Hansford R.G. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J.

Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where K d is the dissociation constant of indo 1, and Sf2 and Sb2are the fluorescence intensities at ∼ 490 nm of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-saturated indicator, respectively. K d was determined to be 207 nm under the present experimental conditions using anin vitro calibration method (17Ziegelstein R.C. Cheng L. Blank P.S. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Hansford R.G.

In some experiments, XeC (2, 6, and 20 μm, Calbiochem) was used after being dissolved in 0.01–0.1% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma).

Cells were then exposed for 2–3 min to Mg2+/ATP-free intracellular-like medium (ICM) containing (in mm): 125 KCl, 19 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA (Sigma) 1, and 0.33 CaCl2 (free Ca2+concentration = 50 nm, pH adjusted to 7.20 at room temperature with KOH). After permeabilization, HAEC were washed with Mg2+/ATP-free ICM and then exposed to complete ICM (containing 1 mm ATP and 1.4 mmMgCl2; free Mg2+ concentration = 0.1 mm) for 10 min to allow for filling of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Permeabilized HAEC were then superfused for at least 10 min with Ca2+-releasing medium (CRM) containing (in mm): 125 KCl, 19 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1.4 MgCl2, and 150 nm CaCl2 (calculated concentration confirmed by fluorescence of indo 1 free acid). The pH of the CRM was adjusted to 7.20 with KOH. Mag-indo 1 fluorescence was recorded at room temperature from single HAEC on coverslips in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of a modified Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope as described above for indo 1. Since low-affinity Ca2+-sensitive indicators like Mag-indo 1 report free Ca2+ concentration in the micromolar range and accumulate in intracellular organelles, they may be effectively used to monitor the free Ca2+ content in these organelles but are relatively insensitive to changes in cytosolic Ca2+, which typically occur in the nanomolar range. The fluorescence ratios at zero and saturating free calcium were determined from 10 μm Mag-indo 1 free acid solutions in Mg2+/ATP-free ICM containing no added CaCl2 and 1 mm EGTA or containing 10 mmCaCl2., respectively, and were used as the minimum and maximum ratios (R min andR max, respectively). R min= 0.19 ± 0.04 and R max = 4.56 ± 0.75 for an average of six experiments using Mag-indo 1-loaded HAEC. The approximate ER Ca2+ was calculated as described previously (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9750-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), according to the formula Ca2+ =K d (R −R min)/(R max −R)(Sf2/Sb2), where K d is the dissociation constant of Mag-indo 1 and Sf2 and Sb2are the fluorescence intensities at 490 nm of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-saturated indicator, respectively. When CRM with different concentrations of free Ca2+(pCa from 8.0 to 5.0) were used, the free Ca2+ concentration was buffered using 10 mm EGTA and 10 mm Ca-EGTA as described previously (21Horiuti K. J. Physiol. 1988; 398: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). An NF-κB-CAT reporter plasmid was transfected into HAEC using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (23Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HAEC were seeded in 60-mm dishes (Falcon) at∼ 2 × 105/ml. After reaching ∼70% confluence, cells were incubated with 2 μg of the reporter plasmid and 12 μg of LipofectAMINE per dish. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and CAT activity was assessed using [14C]chloramphenicol (NENTM Life Science Products, Inc.) and a CAT enzyme assay system (Promega). CAT activity was normalized to the total number of HAEC. The results of three separate experiments using HAEC containing the NF-κB-CAT reporter were used to report CAT activity after stimulation with 1 μm histamine in the absence or presence of XeC. [Ca2+]i oscillations occurred in 26 of 33 HAEC stimulated by 1 μm histamine. The amplitude of these oscillations was relatively constant in 24 of these 26 HAEC (Fig. 1 A). In 4 of the 33 HAEC studied, a single [Ca2+]i transient was observed, and 3 showed no response to this concentration. At higher concentrations (10 μm) histamine typically stimulated a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, characterized by a transient initial increase followed by a persistent elevation above base line (not shown). [Ca2+]i oscillations were inconsistently observed (4 of 11 cells) at a lower concentration of histamine (0.3 μm); the remainder exhibited single [Ca2+]i transients or no response. During an established response to 1 μm histamine, characterized by sustained, nondecremental [Ca2+]i oscillations, XeC produced a dose-dependent decrease in [Ca2+]ioscillation frequency without affecting oscillation amplitude (Fig.1 B). There was a trend for 2 μm XeC to decrease [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency (83.0 ± 5.4%, p = NS versus control, Fig.1 C), but this did not achieve statistical significance until a concentration of 6 μm (63.1 ± 8.6%,p < 0.05). At a concentration of 20 μm, XeC further decreased [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency (45.9 ± 7.4%, p < 0.05versus 2 μm XeC and versuscontrol). The effect of XeC on the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations was partially reversible after washout, as [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency recovered to 68.0 ± 7.9% (p < 0.05versus 20 μm XeC). No changes in [Ca2+]i oscillation amplitude were observed during exposure to XeC (912.3 ± 53.7 nm for controlversus 953.5 ± 127.4 nm for 20 μm XeC, p = NS). The mechanism of the effect of XeC on [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency was examined in permeabilized HAEC using the low-affinity Ca2+ probe Mag-indo 1 to monitor ER Ca2+ release. When intact HAEC monolayers were loaded with Mag-indo 1, fluorescence of the dye distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm. Saponin permeabilization caused a large loss of intracellular fluorescence because of membrane permeabilization and release of intracellular dye. The remaining fluorescence appeared visually to encircle the nucleus. Over a 25-min period, fluorescence intensity decreased by ∼15% (F 405:14.5 ± 2.4%,F 485:15.9 ± 3.2%), although theF 405:F 485 fluorescence ratio changed by <1%. When permeabilized HAEC were exposed to Mg2+- and ATP-containing medium to allow for filling of intracellular Ca2+ stores, the increase of the Mag-indo 1 ratio was dependent on the Ca2+ concentration in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP but was not affected by either Mg2+ alone, Mg2+ and ATP, or Ca2+alone. These findings are consistent with the known characteristics of Mag-indo 1, whose sensitivity to Mg2+ is 100-fold less than to Ca2+ (K d = 3.1 mm for Mg2+ and 35 μm for Ca2+ both at 22 °C, pH = 7.40) (24Lattanzio F.A. Bartschat D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The addition of Ins-1,4,5-P3 stimulated a concentration-dependent decrease in ER Ca2+that saturated at 1 μm (Fig.2 A). The subsequent addition of 1 μm ionomycin further emptied ER Ca2+stores. In the presence of 20 μm XeC (Fig.2 B), Ins-1,4,5-P3-induced Ca2+release was inhibited, but the response to ionomycin was unaffected. XeC (6 and 20 μm) inhibited the maximal ER Ca2+ release induced by Ins-1,4,5-P3 without affecting the approximate EC50 for Ins-1,4,5-P3(440.2 ± 51.0 nm for 6 μm XeC and 483.7 ± 41.7 for 20 μm XeC, p = NSversus vehicle control, 423.2 ± 54.9 nm, Fig. 2 C). The effect of a submaximal concentration of Ins-1,4,5-P3(300 nm) on ER Ca2+ was studied at different Ca2+ concentrations (pCa 8.0 to pCa 5.0) to further characterize the mechanism of XeC. XeC stimulated a dose-dependent shift to the right of the ER Ca2+ release-pCa relationship (Fig.3). Increasing the Ca2+concentration gradually increased Ins-1,4,5-P3-induced ER Ca2+ release from 2.6 ± 0.6% at pCa 8.0 to a maximal effect of 55.7 ± 2.2% for pCa 6.5. Further increases in Ca2+ inhibited Ins-1,4,5-P3-induced ER Ca2+ release (28.8 ± 4.2%, 16.6 ± 3.0%, and 5.9 ± 1.5% for pCa 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0, respectively); this is similar to the bell-shaped ER Ca2+ release-pCa relationship reported previously (22Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In the presence of 20 μm XeC, the Ca2+ concentration for maximal ER Ca2+ release induced by Ins-1,4,5-P3 increased from a pCa of 6.5 to a pCa of 6.0. Thus, in the presence of XeC, higher Ca2+ concentrations are required to activate Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptors than in the absence of XeC. Together, these results show that XeC produces a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of established [Ca2+]i oscillations by noncompetitive inhibition of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor. HAEC were transfected with an NF-κB-CAT reporter plasmid (23Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine whether histamine stimulates NF-κB transcriptional activity in HAEC, as it does in epithelial cells (15Aoki Y. Qiu D. Zhao G.H. Kao P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L1030-L1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histamine (1 μm) induced an ∼14-fold increase in reporter gene activity from a basal level of 0.05 ± 0.00 to 0.70 ± 0.08 units/100 μl of extract/3 × 105cells, Fig. 4). XeC, at concentrations that decrease [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency in histamine-stimulated HAEC, also decreased CAT reporter activity in HAEC stimulated with 1 μm histamine (0.34 ± 0.02 units/100 μl of extract/3 × 105 cells for 6 μm XeC and 0.19 ± 0.02 units/100 μl of extract/3 × 105 cells for 20 μm XeC,p < 0.05 versus histamine alone for each). A 2 μm concentration of XeC, which did not affect [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency, also did not affect CAT reporter activity (0.60 ± 0.10 units/100 μl of extract/3 × 105 cells, p = NSversus histamine alone). XeC by itself did not affect CAT activity (0.04 ± 0.01 units/100 μl of extract/3 × 105 cells, p = NS versus basal level). Similarly, the effect of XeC to inhibit [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency during histamine stimulation in HAEC transfected with the NF-κB-CAT reporter plasmid was not different from that observed in control HAEC (data not shown). Thus, 6 and 20 μm XeC, which decreased [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency from 0.32 ± 0.04 min−1 to 0.20 ± 0.05 min−1 and 0.11 ± 0.03 min−1, respectively, also significantly reduced NF-κB transcriptional activity. We employed the recently developed membrane-permeable Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor blocker XeC to dose-dependently decrease the frequency of established [Ca2+]i oscillations during low-level histamine stimulation. At a concentration of 20 μm, XeC decreased the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations and NF-κB transcriptional activity each by more than 50%. This effect of XeC on Ca2+ signaling results from noncompetitive inhibition of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor and a change in its Ca2+ sensitivity. At the concentrations used in this study, XeC decreased the frequency of histamine-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations within the oscillation frequency dependence range of NF-κB activity previously reported in T lymphocytes in which a “calcium clamp” method was used to generate [Ca2+]i oscillations in the absence of agonist stimulation (12Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). The use of XeC to affect Ca2+ signaling establishes, for the first time, a direct link between [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency and the activity of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB during agonist stimulation. Inactive NF-κB is present in the cytosol, complexed with the inhibitory protein, IκB. Disinhibition of NF-κB occurs when it is released from IκB inhibition, resulting in the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and the binding of NF-κB to the κB motif of the target gene (25Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). The release of active NF-κB is Ca2+-dependent since [Ca2+]i elevations activate NF-κB (26Shatrov V.A. Lehmann V. Chouaib S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas NF-κB activity is decreased by buffering [Ca2+]i (26Shatrov V.A. Lehmann V. Chouaib S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or by inhibiting Ca2+influx (27Kanno T. Siebenlist U. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5277-5283PubMed Google Scholar). It has been thought that Ca2+-dependent processes like NF-κB activation are stimulated when their threshold [Ca2+]i for activation is exceeded. If this view is correct, it is unclear how a given stimulus which increases [Ca2+]i above the threshold for activation of many intracellular targets can activate some but not others. It has recently been suggested that [Ca2+]i oscillations may confer signaling specificity by their frequency rather than by the amplitude of repetitive [Ca2+]i spikes (8Goldbeter A. Dupont G. Berridge M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 9Sneyd J. Keizer J. Sanderson M.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1463-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Frequency modulation may enhance signaling efficiency and permit cells to respond to physiologic stimuli even when peak [Ca2+]i only periodically exceeds the threshold for activation. The regulation of nuclear transcriptional activity by [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency as demonstrated in the present study may provide cells with a specific mechanism whereby gene expression is controlled during agonist stimulation."

Using single islets from KO mice and stimulation with 45 mm KCl, the peak of [Ca2+]i was 3.5-fold greater in islets from KO mice compared with wild type islets (p < 0.01) and [Ca2+]i remained higher during the plateau phase. In addition to the increase in [Ca2+]i in response to KCl there was also a significant increase in insulin release in islets isolated from KO mice. Evidence for modulation by calbindin of [Ca2+]i and insulin release was also noted using β cell lines. Rat calbindin was stably expressed in βTC-3 and βHC-13 cells. In response to depolarizing concentrations of K+, insulin release was decreased by 45–47% in calbindin expressing βTC cells and was decreased by 70–80% in calbindin expressing βHC cells compared with insulin release from vector transfected βTC or βHC cells (p < 0.01). In addition, the K+-stimulated intracellular calcium peak was markedly inhibited in calbindin expressing βHC cells compared with vector transfected cells (225 nm versus1,100 nm, respectively). Buffering of the depolarization-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was also observed in calbindin expressing βTC cells. In summary, our findings, using both isolated islets from calbindin-D28k KO mice and β cell lines, establish a role for calbindin in the modulation of depolarization-stimulated insulin release and suggest that calbindin can control the rate of insulin release via regulation of [Ca2+]i.

Taylor A.N. Science. 1966; 152: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Calbindin has since been reported in many other tissues including kidney and bone and in tissues that are not primary regulators of serum calcium such as brain and pancreas (2Christakos S.

Hyllner S.J. Feldman D. Glorieux F. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Francisco, CA1997: 209-221Google Scholar). This calcium-binding protein has been conserved during evolution and is regulated by a number of different hormones and factors (3Christakos S. Endocr. Rev.

Calbindin-D28k, a predominantly cytosolic protein, is a member of a family of high affinity calcium-binding proteins that includes calmodulin, S100 protein, and parvalbumin (5Heizmann C.W. Hunziker W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the role of calbindin in kidney and intestine is to facilitate transcellular calcium diffusion (6Feher J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C303-C307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bronner F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F707-F711PubMed Google Scholar). In brain, calbindin is not vitamin D-dependent and its proposed function is to buffer calcium, resulting in protection against calcium-mediated neurotoxicity (8Mattson M.P. Rychlik B. Chu C. Christakos S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 9Guo Q. Christakos S. Robinson N. Mattson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Norman A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further autoradiographic and immunohistochemical analyses have shown that vitamin D receptors and calbindin-D28k are both localized in the β cell (11Clark S.A. Stumpf W.E. Sar M. DeLuca H.F.

It has been suggested that the role of vitamin D in calcium metabolism of the β cell may involve a genomic effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3, including the production of calbindin.Although isolated islets and perfused pancreas from vitamin D-deficient animals have previously been used to study the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on β cell function (14Norman A.W. Frankel B.J. Heldt A.M. Grodsky G.M. Science. 1980; 209: 823-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 15Clark S.A. Stumpf W.E. Sar M.

Clark S.A. Gill R.K. Christakos S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1602-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Reddy D. Pollock A.S. Clark S.A. Sooy K. Vasavada R.C. Stewart A.F. Honeyman T.

Although interesting data have been generated in numerous studies using RIN cells, the RIN cell line may not be the best model because these cells have little or no response to glucose and the insulin content of these cells is only approximately 0.1% of the insulin content found in the normal β cell.In this study, to understand the role of calbindin-D28k in the pancreatic β cells, calbindin was transfected and overexpressed in βHC and βTC cells, pancreatic β cells that secrete insulin in a regulated manner and at levels more comparable with those of normal β cells. Both cell lines are derived from transgenic mice that express the SV40 T-antigen in β cells under the control of the insulin gene regulatory region (20D'Ambra R. Surana M. Efrat S. Starr R.G. Fleischer N. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Efrat S. Leiser M. Surana M. Tal M. Fusco-Demane D. Fleischer N.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, calbindin-D28k nullmutant (or knockout) mice were also used because they provide a good model in which to examine the effect of complete ablation of calbindin in the pancreatic islet on insulin release. This study, which is the first to address the role of calbindin in the β cell using both islets and β cell lines, suggests that calbindin has an important role in controlling depolarization-induced increases in intracellular calcium and therefore insulin release from the pancretic β cell.DISCUSSIONIn this study we found that calbindin acts as a modulator of depolarization-induced calcium transients in the pancreatic β cell and that calbindin has a role in controlling depolarization-induced insulin release via regulation of [Ca2+]i. The data show that in islets isolated from calbindin-D28k KO mice, in addition to an increase in [Ca2+]i in response to KCl, there is also an increase in sustained insulin release when compared with WT islets. Although both the peak and plateau [Ca2+]i in response to KCl are significantly greater in the islets from KO mice, only the sustained phase of KCl-induced insulin release (and not peak insulin release) is significantly greater in islets from KO mice when compared with WT islets (Figs. 2 and 3). The most likely explanation of this finding is that 45 mm KCl increases [Ca2+]i in WT islets to a level that is sufficient to maximally induce first phase insulin release. The greater rise in peak [Ca2+]iobserved in the islets from the KO mice cannot result in a further increase in the first phase insulin release rate, although the sustained phase of insulin release (which may not be maximally induced in the WT islets) is significantly increased. Thus the role of calbindin may be as a modulator of the sustained phase of insulin release via regulation of [Ca2+]i. A role for calbindin in modulation of insulin release via regulation of [Ca2+]i was also noted in the studies using calbindin overexpressing β cells. In response to K+stimulation both the [Ca2+]i peak as well as insulin release are decreased or inhibited compared with β cells not expressing calbindin (Figs. 5, 6, 8, and 9). Thus the changes noted in insulin release from cells overexpressing calbindin and islets from KO mice as well as the presence of calbindin in the normal β cell strongly suggest that calbindin plays a role in normal insulin secretory physiology. Reduction of [Ca2+]itransients evoked by voltage depolarization has previously been observed to be a function of calbindin in neurons (24Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A.

A. 1995; 92: 5144-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was suggested that impaired motor coordination, which is the phenotype of the calbindin KO mice, may be the result of abnormal cerebellar activity because of altered depolarization-induced calcium transients in the Purkinje cells (24Airaksinen M.S.

Calbindin was also reported to play a role in the control of hypothalamic neuroendocrine neuronal firing patterns. Calbindin was introduced into rat supraoptic neurons using the whole cell patch clamp method. Calbindin suppressed Ca2+-dependent depolarization after-potentials, and it was suggested that calbindin, by regulating depolarization-induced potentials, may be involved in the control of hormone secretion from hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons (38Li Z. Decavel C. Hatton G.I. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus calbindin appears to act similarly in β cells and neurons. Functional and phenotypic similarities have previously been reported between neurons and pancreatic β cells. For example β cells, similar to neurons, express proteins and amino acids specialized for neurotransmission such as glutamate receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid and synapsin I (39Weaver C.D. Yao T.L. Powers A.C. Verdoorn T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12977-12984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40Rorsman P. Berggren P.O. Bokvist K. Ericson H. Mohler H.

Glutamate has been shown to induce depolarization in islets and currents evoked by glutamate in islets show properties very similar to currents induced in neurons (39Weaver C.D. Yao T.L. Powers A.C. Verdoorn T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12977-12984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is of interest that in previous studies in neurons, calbindin has been reported to reduce [Ca2+]i in response to glutamate (8Mattson M.P. Rychlik B. Chu C. Christakos S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that calbindin may similarly modulate the rise [Ca2+]i in response not only to K+ but also to glutamate in the β cell. In our study we focused on the effect of calbindin on modulation of calcium transients in islets and β cell lines induced by depolarizing concentrations of KCl. Not much is known, however, about the ability of calbindin to modulate calcium influx in the β cell in response to other secretagogues. In one study using RIN1046-38 cells, induction of calbindin was shown to attenuate the [Ca2+]iresponse to the secretagogues glucose and KCl as well as to the calcium ionophore ionomycin and to thapsigargin (which releases Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores) (44Rhoten W.B. Sergeev I.N. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 989-995Google Scholar). These studies, combined with our findings, suggest a basic role for calbindin in controlling various calcium fluxes in the β cell.In addition to calbindin, calmodulin (45Watkins D.T. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and calcyclin (46Okazaki K. Niki I. Iino S. Kobayashi S. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6149-6152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are two other calcium-binding proteins present in the β cell that have been reported to play a role, through their interaction with Ca2+, in modulating the insulin secretory response. Calcyclin, unlike calbindin, which acts as a Ca2+ buffer, was reported to enhance insulin release by a mechanism involving Ca2+-induced exocytosis (46Okazaki K. Niki I. Iino S. Kobayashi S. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6149-6152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using transgenic mice with the calcium-binding protein calmodulin overexpressed in the pancreatic β cells show that these mice (referred to as CaM mice) have decreased plasma insulin levels, leading to increased serum glucose levels and early onset of diabetes (47Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 1067-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Impairment in the metabolism of glucose and the subsequent generation of ATP was reported to be the underlying mechanism involved in the defective insulin secretion in the calmodulin transgenic mouse (48Ribar T.J. Jan C.-R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Further studies were done on another mouse transgenic line, referred to as CaM-8. CaM-8 expresses in its β cells a mutant form of calmodulin that is functionally similar to calbindin because it binds calcium with high affinity, and, unlike calmodulin but similar to calbindin, it does not activate effector proteins such as protein phosphatases and kinases (49Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Jan C.-R. Ribar T.J. Means A.R. Augustine G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15478-15485Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The CaM-8 transgenic mice also display defective insulin secretion. However the mechanism responsible for the underlying defect in insulin secretion is different than the mechanism reported for the CaM mice. The primary defect in the CaM-8 mice is not a defect in glucose utilization but rather a reduction in Ca2+ current flowing through voltage-gated calcium channels resulting in a reduction in the rise in [Ca2+]i (50Jan C.-R. Ribar T.J. Means A.R. Augustine G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15478-15485Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). CaM-8 mice showed a marked attenuation in the elevation in [Ca2+]iobserved in response to depolarizing concentrations of KCl (50Jan C.-R. Ribar T.J. Means A.R. Augustine G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15478-15485Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), similar to the attenuation observed in our studies in isolated islets and in β cells overexpressing calbindin. Further, patch clamp measurements using β cells from CaM-8 mice revealed a significant decline in the peak amplitude of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel currents. The Ca2+ channels affected by the CaM-8 mutation are the l-type Ca2+ channels because dihydropyridines blocked these currents (50Jan C.-R. Ribar T.J. Means A.R. Augustine G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15478-15485Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is of interest that previous patch clamp studies using GH3 pituitary cells stably transfected with calbindin found that calbindin reduces Ca2+ influx through voltage dependent l-type Ca2+ channels (51Lledo P.M. Somasundaram B. Morton A.J. Emson P.C. Mason W.T. Neuron. 1992; 9: 943-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, immunohistochemical studies mapping calbindin in brain noted the similarity between the distribution of calbindin immunoreactivity and the distribution ofl-type calcium channels mapped using autoradiography (52Celio M.R. Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 375-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine (as suggested by our studies with KCl and the similarities observed between calbindin and CaM-8) whether calbindin can act not only as a buffer protein but also as a protein that can affect other Ca2+-regulating proteins such as Ca2+ channels not only in GH3 cells but also in β cells. In the future, it will be of interest to examine whether calbindin can modulate Ca2+ channel activity by a direct binding mechanism or whether calbindin can affect other proteins involved in regulating calcium channels.In addition to depolarizing concentrations of potassium, calbindin overexpression was also found to suppress insulin secretion in response to the phorbol ester TPA, which is known to activate certain forms of protein kinase C. TPA can stimulate insulin secretion in the presence or absence of basal glucose (35Yada T. Russo L.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2455-2462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Regazzi R. Li G. Deshusses J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15003-15009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Carpinelli A.R. Poloczek P. Winand J. Castagna M. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 3827-3831PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phorbol ester-stimulated insulin secretion is linked with membrane depolarization and an increase in [Ca2+]i (35Yada T. Russo L.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2455-2462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,55Arkhammar P. Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Welsh M. Nanberg E. Sjöholm A. Kohler M. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the effect of KCl. The Ca2+ channels responsible for the increased [Ca2+]i signal in response to TPA have been reported to be the l-type Ca2+ channels (35Yada T. Russo L.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2455-2462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Arkhammar P. Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Welsh M. Nanberg E. Sjöholm A. Kohler M. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Velasco J.M. Petersen O.H. Q. J. Exp. Physiol. 1989; 74: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the role for PKC is to maintain the phosphorylation state of the voltage-gated l-type Ca2+ channel, thus enabling the appropriate function of this channel (55Arkhammar P. Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Welsh M. Nanberg E. Sjöholm A. Kohler M. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting effect of TPA is similar but not identical to the effect of KCl because less depolarization is observed in response to TPA and additional actions of TPA have been suggested (35Yada T. Russo L.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2455-2462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Arkhammar P. Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Welsh M. Nanberg E. Sjöholm A. Kohler M. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus calbindin may be a modulator of insulin secretion in response to both KCl and TPA because both secretagogues act, at least in part, by a similar mechanism. Calbindin, in response to both secretagogues, may act by reducing Ca2+ influx through voltage dependent calcium channels.Although this study clearly establishes for the first time a role for calbindin in the modulation of depolarization-stimulated insulin release (in response to KCl or TPA), the exact role of calbindin in response to other secretagogues (including glucose, a variety of neuropeptides, and other transmitter substances that can combine to activate Ca2+ oscillations in the β cell) remains to be determined. Further studies in βHC cells, which have been reported to preserve the major characteristics of glucose metabolism of native β cells better than other murine β cell lines (22Radvanyi F. Christgau S. Baekkeskov S. Jolicoeur C. Hanahan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Heimberg H. Devos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ. J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 58Liang Y. Bai G. Doliba N. Buettger C. Wang L. Berner D.K. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E846-E857PubMed Google Scholar), will be of interest to examine the consequences of calbindin overexpression on glucose-dependent functions in the β cells. It is possible that calbindin has a “fine tuning” modulatory role on glucose-dependent insulin release that may not be obvious unless the effect is amplified (for example by activation of protein kinase A).It is also likely that calbindin can have functions in the β cell in addition to modulation of insulin release. Previous studies by Bourlonet al. (59Bourlon P-.M. Faure-Dussert A. Billaudel B. Sutter B.Ch.J. Tramu G. Thomasset M. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 148: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of calbindin in α as well as β cells of the rat pancreatic islet and suggested an additional role for islet calbindin in glucagon secretion. In this study correlations were made between levels of calbindin as measured by densitometry of immunocytochemically stained sections of pancreas and glucagon secretion. Additional studies using more sensitive methods of quantitation as well as studies with islets from calbindin KO mice may provide additional insight with regard to the interesting possibility of a relationship between calbindin and glucagon secretion. In the nervous system the proposed role of calbindin, similar to its role in the β cell, is to buffer calcium. In the nervous system buffering of calcium by calbindin results in protection against calcium-mediated toxicity. Thus in the β cell, similar to the neuron, in response to depolarization-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, calbindin may buffer the rise in [Ca2+]i to prevent calcium-mediated β cell death. Further studies are needed to examine other potential functions of calbindin in the β cell.The role of calcium targets in the β cell has not been well understood. Although further studies are needed to determine additional mechanisms and multiple consequences of calbindin in the β cell, our findings, using islets from KO mice and β cells lines, are important because they define a role for calbindin in the β cell in calcium regulation and modulation of insulin release. Calbindin-D28k is a 28,000 M rcalcium-binding protein initially identified in avian intestine and was the first known target of vitamin D action (1Wasserman R.H. Taylor A.N. Science. 1966; 152: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Calbindin has since been reported in many other tissues including kidney and bone and in tissues that are not primary regulators of serum calcium such as brain and pancreas (2Christakos S. Gabrielides C. Rhoten W.B. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 3Christakos S. Endocr. Rev. Monograph. 1995; 4: 108-110Google Scholar, 4Christakos S. Beck J.D. Hyllner S.J. Feldman D. Glorieux F. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Francisco, CA1997: 209-221Google Scholar). This calcium-binding protein has been conserved during evolution and is regulated by a number of different hormones and factors (3Christakos S. Endocr. Rev. Monograph. 1995; 4: 108-110Google Scholar, 4Christakos S. Beck J.D. Hyllner S.J. Feldman D. Glorieux F. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Francisco, CA1997: 209-221Google Scholar). Calbindin-D28k, a predominantly cytosolic protein, is a member of a family of high affinity calcium-binding proteins that includes calmodulin, S100 protein, and parvalbumin (5Heizmann C.W. Hunziker W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the role of calbindin in kidney and intestine is to facilitate transcellular calcium diffusion (6Feher J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C303-C307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bronner F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F707-F711PubMed Google Scholar). In brain, calbindin is not vitamin D-dependent and its proposed function is to buffer calcium, resulting in protection against calcium-mediated neurotoxicity (8Mattson M.P. Rychlik B. Chu C. Christakos S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 9Guo Q. Christakos S. Robinson N. Mattson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In 1979 the discovery in the pancreas of a high affinity receptor for the hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), was the first demonstration of a nonclassical target tissue to contain vitamin D receptors (10Christakos S. Norman A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further autoradiographic and immunohistochemical analyses have shown that vitamin D receptors and calbindin-D28k are both localized in the β cell (11Clark S.A. Stumpf W.E. Sar M. DeLuca H.F.

If LPS binds to circulating leukocytes, it triggers innate host defense mechanisms and often elicits toxic reactions. If instead LPS binds to plasma lipoproteins, its bioactivity is largely neutralized. This study shows that lipoproteins can also take up LPS that has first bound to leukocytes. When monocytes were loaded with [3H]LPS and then incubated in plasma, they released over 70% of the cell-associated [3H]LPS into lipoproteins (predominantly high density lipoprotein), whereas in serum-free medium the [3H]LPS remained tightly associated with the cells. The transfer reaction could be reproduced in the presence of pure native lipoproteins or reconstituted high density lipoprotein. Plasma immunodepletion experiments and experiments using recombinant LPS transfer proteins revealed that soluble CD14 significantly enhances LPS release from the cells, high concentrations of LPS-binding protein have a modest effect, and phospholipid transfer protein is unable to facilitate LPS release. Essentially all of the LPS on the monocyte cell surface can be released. Lipoprotein-mediated LPS release was accompanied by a reduction in several cellular responses to the LPS, suggesting that the movement of LPS from leukocytes into lipoproteins may attenuate host responses to LPS in vivo.

Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6383) Google Scholar), are particularly sensitive to LPS (4Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752PubMed Google Scholar). They respond by producing inflammatory mediators that amplify and diversify the LPS signal, triggering host defenses that wall off and destroy invading bacteria. For reasons that are not entirely clear, however, the response to LPS can also be harmful, resulting in severe sepsis, septic shock, and even death. Mechanisms that regulate responses to LPS are therefore likely to be very important for the host.HDL is the most abundant of the lipoproteins in human plasma and interstitial fluids. It can remove both phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol from cells (reviewed in Ref. 5Rothblat G.H. De la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux and the subsequent delivery of HDL-cholesterol to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport) are thought to help protect animals from atherosclerosis. This study addresses another facet of the HDL particle: its ability to bind LPS and neutralize its biological activity. There is abundant evidence that HDL and other plasma lipoproteins play an important role in controlling host responses to LPS. Numerous studies have shown that complexes of LPS with HDL and other lipoproteins have little or no stimulatory activity, eitherin vitro or in vivo (6Ulevitch R.J. Johnston A.R. Weinstein D.B. J.

We found that HDL facilitates the release of cell-bound LPS, that sCD14 enhances this release, and that the removal of LPS from the cells attenuates proinflammatory responses. This new pathway of LPS traffic to lipoproteins may be important for regulating host responses to Gram-negative bacteria. These findings also raise the possibility that efflux of microbial ligands from macrophages to HDL contributes to the anti-inflammatory potency of HDL in processes such as atherosclerosis.RESULTSHuman plasma rapidly removes LPS from monocytes. LPS binds rapidly to mCD14 on monocytes and THP-1 cells; maximal binding occurs within a few minutes. In contrast, bound LPS dissociates from the cells very slowly in the absence of serum, even when the cells are treated with inhibitors that prevent LPS internalization (23Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments shown in Fig. 1, CD14-transfected THP-1 cells were loaded with [3H]LPS for 5 min at 37 °C, washed to remove the unbound LPS, and then reincubated in either SFM or human plasma. As expected, [3H]LPS bound to the cells rapidly and then dissociated extremely slowly from cells that were suspended in SFM. When plasma was added after the cells were loaded with LPS, in contrast, the cells rapidly released most of the LPS they had bound. Plasma-mediated LPS release was not due to cell loss or membrane permeability, as trypan blue exclusion by the cells was not affected (not shown).Cell-derived LPS Binds to Plasma LipoproteinsWe next asked whether the released [3H]LPS was transferred to plasma lipoproteins. After the [3H]LPS-loaded cells had been incubated with plasma for 30 min, the major lipoprotein classes (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) in the culture supernatants were separated by ultracentrifugation in KBr at different densities (d) to isolate VLDL, IDL, and chylomicrons (d ≤ 1.019 g/ml), LDL (1.019 < d ≤ 1.063 g/ml), and HDL (1.063 < d ≤ 1.21 g/ml). The recoveries of [3H]LPS, total cholesterol, and phospholipids were 74 ± 9, 86 ± 3, and 87 ± 7%, respectively (mean ± S.D.; n = 4). After correcting for recovery of lipoprotein cholesterol, 80% of the released LPS was found in lipoproteins (the majority was in HDL), whereas only 5.6% was in nonlipoprotein fractions (d > 1.21 g/ml), and 14% was not accounted for (Table I). In control experiments, free [3H]LPS did not float at any KBr density in the absence of plasma, even when the LPS was prebound to sCD14 or LBP or released from cells by protease treatment.Table IDistribution of released LPS among human plasma lipoproteins separated by ultracentrifugal flotationd<1.019 (VLDL)1.019–1.063 (LDL)1.063–1.21 (HDL)≥1.21%[3H]LPS2.721.5565.6(1.4)(3.8)(10)(6)LPS:cholesterol ratioND1-aND, not determined.3.912.8ND(0.8)(5.9)LPS:phospholipid ratio2.67.49.25.6(1.0)(1.2)(4.0)(4.1)[3H]LPS-loaded THP-1 cells were incubated with human plasma for 30 min.

The data are means (S.D.) of four experiments performed in duplicate.1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Having shown that at least 80% of the released [3H]LPS was bound to lipoproteins, we also separated the lipoproteins according to their particle sizes on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Fig.2); most of the cell-derived [3H]LPS co-eluted with HDL and LDL, the majority being in the HDL fractions. Whether the distribution of lipoprotein-bound [3H]LPS was measured by centrifugal flotation (Table I) or gel filtration (Fig. 2), it correlated closely with phospholipid content but not with total cholesterol. Taken together, these experiments showed that HDL was the dominant acceptor for cell-bound LPS in normal plasma (HDL > LDL ≫ VLDL), and the distribution among the fractions correlated with the phospholipid content of the lipoproteins. In experiments not shown, HDL was also the dominant acceptor when free [3H]LPS was added to plasma.Figure 2Chromatographic separation of plasma [3H] LPS released by cells. Whole human plasma was incubated with [3H]LPS-loaded THP-1 cells for 30 min as in Fig. 1. 200 μl of the resulting plasma was separated on a Superose 6 column, and the fractions were assayed for phospholipids (μg/fraction), total cholesterol (μg/fraction), and [3H]LPS (dpm divided by 10) per fraction. Recoveries of phospholipids, cholesterol, and [3H]LPS were 92, 91, and 80%, respectively. HDL peak fractions contained apoA-I but not apoB, whereas LDL peak fractions contained apoB but not apoA-I (not shown). The experiment was repeated with plasma from a different donor with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purified Plasma Lipoproteins Promote the Release of Cell-associated LPSWe next studied LPS release from THP-1 cells into serum-free medium to which pure lipoproteins were added, with or without added recombinant LPS transfer proteins. The results show that nHDL (Fig.3, A–C) or R-HDL (Fig. 3,D–F) promoted LPS release from the cells without a requirement for soluble LPS transfer proteins. R-HDL promoted more rapid LPS release than did nHDL, in keeping with the ability of R-HDL to rapidly adsorb free LPS (32Lerch P.G. Förtsch V. Hodler G. Bolli R. Vox Sang. 1996; 71: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In experiments not shown, nLDL promoted LPS release with kinetics that were similar to those of nHDL. Adding rsCD14 to nHDL (Fig. 3 A) or R-HDL (Fig.3 D) accelerated the release of cell-associated LPS. Testing different concentrations of sCD14 showed that maximal release was obtained at approximately 5 μg of sCD14/ml (not shown). rLBP also accelerated the release of cell-associated LPS in the presence of R-HDL (Fig. 3 E), with maximal release at 0.03 μg of rLBP/ml, whereas the same concentration of rLBP had no effect in the presence of nHDL (not shown). However, when much higher concentrations (10 μg of rLBP-His/ml) were added, the LBP slightly enhanced LPS release from the cells in the presence of nHDL (Fig. 3 B). The low activity of the rLBP-His in this assay was not due to its inability to transfer LPS; 1 μg of rLBP-His/ml completely restored the ability of LBP-depleted plasma to promote [3H]LPS binding to mCD14 on cells, and the activities of the rLBP and rLBP-His were similar (not shown). PLTP had no effect in the presence of either lipoprotein (Fig.3, C and F) at concentrations (up to 20 μg rPLTP/ml) that were many fold higher than normal plasma PLTP concentrations. The lack of effect of rPLTP was not due to a lack of LPS transfer activity. In experiments not shown, less than 1 μg of rPLTP/ml transferred 80% of free [3H]LPS (200 ng/ml) to native lipoproteins, whereas rPTLP was unable to transfer much smaller amounts (∼20 ng/ml) of cell-bound [3H]LPS to HDL (Fig.3, C and F) or LDL (not shown). rPLTP did not contribute to the release of LPS when it was added together with rsCD14 or rLBP (not shown).Figure 3Pure HDL particles promote the release of cell-associated LPS . [3H]LPS-loaded THP-1 cells were incubated with SFM with or without nHDL (1 mg of apoA-I/ml) (A–C) or R-HDL (0.1 mg of apoA-I/ml) (D–F) with or without rsCD14 (5 μg/ml) (A and D), rLBP-His (10 μg/ml) (B), rLBP (0.06 μg/ml) (E), or rPLTP (C and F) for the indicated times and analyzed as in Fig. 1. Each experiment was performed at least three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)No significant release of cell-associated LPS occurred in the presence of rLBP or rPLTP alone (Fig. 3, B, C, E, and F). In contrast, when sCD14 was added alone (Fig. 3, A andD), the cells released 20–30% of their LPS within 7 min and maintained the same percentage of released LPS throughout the time course of the incubation. Maximal LPS release did not occur unless lipoproteins were added. These data suggest that an equilibrium is rapidly established between cell-associated LPS and soluble LPS-sCD14 complexes, whereas the addition of a stronger LPS acceptor (HDL) shifts the equilibrium toward the lipoprotein particles and allows the bulk of the LPS to be removed from the cells.sCD14 Enhances the Release of LPS into Human PlasmaTo test whether normal plasma levels of the three LPS transfer proteins are important for accelerating LPS release from cells into whole plasma, we immunodepleted or neutralized LBP, PLTP, or sCD14 using specific antibodies. Immunodepletion removed 97 ± 4 (n = 8) and 99.6 ± 0.3% (n = 5) of the immunoreactive plasma sCD14 and LBP, respectively. As expected, LPS binding assays showed a marked reduction in the ability of LBP-depleted plasma to promote [3H]LPS binding to THP-1 cells; 49.1 ± 0.1% of the added [3H]LPS bound to the cells in control plasma, whereas 4.4 ± 2.8% bound in LBP-depleted plasma (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). Anti-PLTP neutralized 97 ± 1% (n = 3) of the plasma PLTP activity.As shown in Fig. 4, reducing sCD14 levels significantly decreased the release of cell-associated [3H]LPS into plasma, whereas reducing LBP or PLTP levels had no effect. Neutralization of PLTP in LBP-depleted plasma also had no effect on LPS release from cells (not shown). The amount of cell-associated [3H]LPS released into sCD14-depleted plasma was the same as that released into serum-free medium to which were added approximately normal concentrations of plasma lipoproteins (isolated by KBr density flotation (d < 1.21 g/ml)); the isolated lipoprotein fraction was essentially devoid of sCD14, LBP, and PLTP (not shown). Normal activity was restored to sCD14-depleted plasma by adding physiologic concentrations (2 μg/ml) of rsCD14 (Fig.4), whereas adding rPLTP (10 μg/ml) or rLBP (0.5 μg/ml) had no effect, and adding rLBP-His (10 μg/ml) only slightly increased LPS transfer.Figure 4Immunodepletion of sCD14 from normal plasma reduces the release of cell-associated LPS .[3H]LPS-loaded THP-1 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with control plasma or plasma immunodepleted of LBP (LBP−), PLTP (PLTP−), or sCD14 (sCD14−); rsCD14 (2 μg/ml) was added to sCD14-depleted plasma (sCD14− + rsCD14), or isolated plasma lipoproteins were added to SFM (LP). The release of cell-associated [3H]LPS was measured and expressed as a percentage of LPS released by control plasma (mean ± S.D., number of experiments (n) = 5, 3, 8, 8, and 3, respectively). The percentage of cell-associated [3H]LPS released into control plasma was 52 ± 8% (n = 13).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the Presence of Lipoproteins, Monocytes Release Almost All Cell-Surface LPSAs noted above, the fraction of the total cell-associated LPS that was released from the cells in the presence of lipoproteins reached a plateau at approximately 70–80%. We used two LPS internalization assays (23Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the cellular location of the remaining 20–30% of the LPS. In the experiment shown in Fig.5, the release of cell-associated LPS was measured in normal human monocytes (mononuclear cells). After various incubation times in the presence of R-HDL, the cells were washed and incubated with 0.02% proteinase K on ice to remove LPS from mCD14 or other protease-sensitive LPS-binding proteins on the cell surface. Before the cells were exposed to R-HDL (Fig. 5 A, time 0), the protease released 78% of the total cell-associated [3H]LPS. After 60 min in the presence of R-HDL + rLBP, the cells released 73% of the [3H]LPS into the medium (not shown), and protease treatment released only an additional 2% of the original cell-associated [3H]LPS (Fig.5 A). The results suggest that R-HDL promoted the release of nearly all of the surface-bound (protease-sensitive) LPS from the cells, whereas the remaining cell-associated LPS was protease-resistant (Fig. 5 B). Because surface-exposed LPS that is inserted into the membrane or bound to a protease-resistant protein would be counted with the internalized LPS in this assay, we measured cell-associated BODIPY-LPS by flow cytometry before and after quenching the fluorescence of the surface-exposed BODIPY-LPS with trypan blue. Before rewarming the cells (Fig. 5 C, 0–4 °C), the surface and internal fractions of LPS were 80 and 20%, respectively. After incubation with R-HDL, surface LPS decreased dramatically, whereas there was little change in internalized LPS. Similar results were obtained using normal human monocytes (not shown). These data suggest that virtually all of the cell-surface LPS is rapidly released in the presence of lipoprotein particles, leaving only internalized LPS.Figure 5HDL promotes LPS release from monocyte surfaces. A and B, PBMC were loaded with [3H]LPS (total cell-associated [3H]LPS per tube was 520 dpm) and incubated with R-HDL (0.1 mg of apoA-I/ml) with or without rLBP (0.03 μg/ml) for the indicated times. After washing, the cells were treated with cold protease solution as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A shows the percentage of the total cell-associated [3H]LPS that could be released by proteolysis of cell-surface proteins, and B shows the protease-resistant fraction. Percentages were calculated from the original cell-associated [3H]LPS. C,CD14-transfected THP-1 cells were loaded with BODIPY-LPS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Surface and internalized fractions of cell-associated LPS were determined by measuring internal LPS (presence of trypan blue) and total LPS (absence of trypan blue) by flow cytometry before (0–4 °C) or after reincubating (30 min at 37 °C) the washed cells in rLBP (0.03 μg/ml) and rsCD14 (2 μg/ml). Surface LPS was calculated (total minus internal). The experiments were repeated with similar results. Symbols anderror bars show mean ± range of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)HDL Attenuates Signal Responses in LPS-loaded CellsThe cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with LPS concentrations that were sufficient to stimulate cytokine responses. The unbound LPS was removed by washing, the cells were incubated in fresh serum-free medium with or without R-HDL or nHDL, and cytokines released by the cells were measured. IL-8, which is produced rapidly in response to LPS (27Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9904-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), was measured in the medium after incubation for 2 h, whereas the cells were incubated for 16 h before measuring cytokines that are produced more slowly (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). As shown in TableII, in both freshly isolated PBMC and THP-1 cells, R-HDL reduced IL-8 release to approximately 45% of control levels. nHDL was less inhibitory than R-HDL in this assay, in keeping with the ability of R-HDL to promote more rapid LPS release, yet nHDL was an effective inhibitor of cytokine responses that occurred over a longer time period. nHDL reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 release by LPS-loaded PBMC to 49–61% of control levels; this inhibitory effect appeared to be LPS-specific because the cellular response to recombinant IL-1B (rIL-1β) was not inhibited. Similar degrees of response inhibition occurred after cells had been exposed to various stimulatory concentrations of LPS. Because the measurements of LPS release described above were performed using higher LPS concentrations, we asked whether the rate of LPS release was different when lower amounts of LPS had bound to the cells. We found that after exposure to only 3 ng/ml [3H]LPS, the percentage of cell-associated LPS released in the presence of nHDL and sCD14 in 1 h was only slightly greater than the percentage of LPS released by cells that had been exposed to 50 ng/ml [3H]LPS (data not shown). Although the specific activity of our [3H]LPS precluded cell binding and release measurements at lower concentrations, we believe that the measurements of [3H]LPS movement presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 can be used to describe the LPS release that occurs at low levels of cell-bound LPS (Table II).Table IIHDL reduces cytokine responses in LPS-loaded cellsAgonistResponseCellsHDLCytokines released% of controlLPSIL-8 (2 h)THP-1R-HDL41 ± 1.5 (n = 3)LPSIL-8 (2 h)PBMCR-HDL49 ± 16 (n = 3)LPSIL-8 (2 h)THP-1nHDL77 ± 15 (n = 3)LPSIL-8 (2 h)PBMCnHDL108 ± 17 (n = 2)LPSTNF-α (16 h)PBMCnHDL49 ± 20 (n = 5)LPSIL-1β (16 h)PBMCnHDL49 ± 22 (n = 6)LPSIL-6 (16 h)PBMCnHDL61 ± 15 (n = 5)IL-1βIL-6 (16 h)PBMCnHDL119 ± 34 (n = 3)For IL-8 response assays, cells were pulsed with LPS (0.03–0.1 ng/ml for PBMC or 0.3–1 ng/ml for THP-1 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-differentiated cells), washed, and reincubated in SFM containing R-HDL, rLBP (0.03 μg/ml), and sCD14 (5 μg/ml) as described in Fig. 5. For TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 response assays, PBMC were pulsed with LPS (0.3–3 ng/ml), washed, and reincubated in medium with or without nHDL (1 mg of apoA-I/ml) in the absence of LPS transfer proteins for 16 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control experiments, the cells were incubated with rIL-1β (5–10 ng/ml) in the absence of LPS to stimulate IL-6 production. Cytokines were measured in the culture supernatants by ELISA. The data are shown as percentage of control values (100%) obtained from the same LPS-loaded cells that were incubated in the absence of HDL. Means ± S.D. are shown for nexperiments done in duplicate or triplicate. Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAlthough numerous studies have shown that HDL and other lipoproteins can bind and neutralize the biological activity of free LPS, lipoprotein-mediated removal of LPS from cell membranes has not been previously described. We found not only that LPS can leave the monocyte surface and bind lipoproteins, but also that exposing LPS-loaded cells to HDL significantly reduces the production of several cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8). Inhibition of LPS responses occurred when cell responses to a non-LPS agonist, IL-1β, were not affected. The findings thus suggest that removing LPS from the cell surface in the presence of HDL attenuates cellular responses.Our data suggest that prolonged contact of the cells with LPS must be maintained in order to produce LPS signals of maximal strength and duration. This hypothesis is supported by other studies. For example, prolonged expression of LPS-induced inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, and tissue factor) in whole blood requires continuous exposure to LPS (38Dedrick R.L. Conlon P.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in vivo therapeutic intervention with Limulus anti-LPS factor (39Roth R.I. Su D.H. Child A.H. Wainwright N.R. Levin J. J. Infect.

Old Herborn Univ. Semin.

The reaction mechanism of many phosphatases or phosphotransferases involves the formation of a catalytic intermediate, in which the phosphate group derived from the substrate is bound to the side chain of a serine, histidine, cysteine (1Vincent J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2038260033,"The immediate-early gene cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) is induced in a variety of hyperplastic pathological conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and colorectal cancer. Although a causal role for Cox-2 has been proposed, mechanisms by which Cox-2 function contributes to the pathogenesis of hyperplastic disease are not well defined. We constructed a green fluorescent protein-tagged Cox-2 (Cox-2-GFP) to examine its effects on a variety of cell types upon overexpression. Subcellular localization and enzymatic and pharmacological properties of Cox-2-GFP polypeptide were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type Cox-2 polypeptide. Overexpression of the Cox-2-GFP or the Cox-2 polypeptide by transient transfection suppressed the population of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, with a concomitant increase in G(0)/G(1) population. In contrast, transient overexpression of GFP had no effect on cell cycle distribution, whereas endoplasmic reticulum-retained GFP (GFP-KDEL) overexpression was associated with only a minor decrease of cells in S phase. Interestingly, neither NS-398 (a Cox-2-specific inhibitor) nor indomethacin could reverse the effect of Cox-2-GFP overexpression on cell cycle progression. Furthermore, two mutants of Cox-2, S516Q and S516M, which lack the cyclooxygenase activity, exhibited the same effect as Cox-2-GFP. The cell cycle effect of Cox-2-GFP was observed in ECV-304, NIH 3T3, COS-7, bovine microvascular endothelial cells, and human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These findings suggest that Cox-2 inhibits cell cycle progression in a variety of cell types by a novel mechanism that does not require the synthesis of prostaglandins."

RA treatment of U937 cells is characterized by a decrease in Bcl-2 and marked induction of ""tissue"" transglutaminase (tTG) gene expression. In this study, we show that the inhibition of tTG expression in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis prevents their death. In fact, U937 cell-derived clones transfected with the human tTG gene in the antisense orientation showed a pronounced decrease in apoptosis induced by several stimuli. These findings demonstrate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent irreversible cross-linking of intracellular proteins catalyzed by tTG represents an important biochemical event in the gene-regulated cell death in monoblasts. In addition, our data indicate that the apoptotic program in promonocytic cells is strictly regulated by RA and that a key role is played by the free intracellular calcium concentration."

Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One site is near the MEK C terminus, and the second is in the proline-rich insert. These sites are phosphorylated in intact cells (16Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt R.R. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In vitro and in cells, the proline-rich insert of MEK1 is also phosphorylated by the p21-activated kinase PAK1, among others (11Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P.S. Lewis R. Ahn J. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the regulated binding of the insert to an unknown factor improved the efficiency of ERK activation. A binding site for ERK2 at the N terminus of MEK1 was found to mediate their stable association (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This type of interaction may also take place between other MEK/MAP kinase pairs. 2B. Mayer, personal communication. Because MEK1 contains a nuclear export sequence, it has been suggested that the binding to MEK1 retains ERK2 in the cytosol of unstimulated cells (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We examined the impact of this binding site on the feedback phosphorylation of MEK1 on Thr292 and Thr386 by ERK2 and the activation of ERK2 by MEK1. Deletion of the binding site reduced the rate of phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2, but had no effect on MEK1 phosphorylation by PAK1. Deletion of the N terminus of MEK1 also reduced its ability to phosphorylate ERK2 in vitro and to stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 in transfected cells. Using ERK2-p38 chimeras and an ERK2 deletion mutant, a site of MEK1 binding was localized to the N terminus of ERK2. This study implies a significant role for the ERK-MEK noncatalytic association in signaling through the cascade. The pRSET-MEK1(FL) and pRSET-MEK1(ΔN1) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Natalie Ahn (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). ΔN1 lacks the first 32 amino acids of MEK1 (19Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To create kinase-dead versions of these constructs, the conserved lysine 97 in subdomain II was mutated to methionine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were 5′-GGTCATGGCCAGAATGCTAATTCATCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGATGAATTAGCATTCTGGCCATGACC-3′. To subclone full-length MEK1 and MEK1-ΔN1 DNAs into pCMV5-Myc, the DNAs were digested withHindIII first, filled in by Klenow, and then digested withBamHI. 1.5-kilobase pair DNA fragments were gel-isolated and ligated into pCMV5-Myc digested with BamHI-SmaI. pCEP4HA-ERK2 was as described (11Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P.S. Lewis R. Ahn J. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and pCMV5-Elk-1-His6was kindly provided by Peter Shaw. His-tagged, kinase-dead MEK1 proteins were expressed and purified inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Overnight cultures grown in terrific broth containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 125 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated into 1 liter of TB/chloramphenicol/ampicillin. The culture was grown at 30 °C untilA 600 = 0.4–0.6 and induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at room temperature. Cell pellets were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice, and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Cells were lysed in a glass homogenizer and then sonicated. Supernatants were adjusted to 1% Tween 20, 1 m NaCl, and 20% glycerol, and MEK proteins were purified as described (15Mansour S.J. Resing K.A. Candia J.M. Hermann A.S. Gloor J.W. Herskind K.R. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Ahn N.G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The concentrations of MEK proteins were estimated by comparing serial dilutions to bovine serum albumin standards on the same gel. MEK1-ΔN1 and full-length MEK1 express equally well in bacteria and in mammalian cells (see below). Active ERK2 was prepared and purified as described (20Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P.

GST-PAK1-(232–544) was kindly provided by Jeff Frost (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). His6-tagged wild-type MEK1, MEK1-T292A and MEK1-T386A proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Ahn. Recombinant GST-ERK2-K52R was expressed and purified as described (4Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged ERK2-p38 chimeras were created and purified as described (21Wilsbacher J. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GST-ERK2 truncated after ERK2 residue 337 was kindly provided by Megan Robinson. The two MEK1 N-terminal peptides synthesized were P1 (KKKPTPIQLNPAPAGSAVNG) and P2 (RRRLNPAPAGSAVNGTSSAE), which overlaps with P1 as indicated by underlining. Neither was a substrate for ERK2. Kinase reactions were carried out in 30 μl of 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 μm ATP (1 cpm/fmol) at 30 °C for the indicated times. Reactions were stopped by adding 6 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling for 2 min. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). 293 cells at 50–80% confluence were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. After 16 h, cells were placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and maintained for 24 h prior to harvest. For immunoprecipitation kinase assays, cells from each 60-mm dish were collected and lysed in 0.5 ml of 50 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors. For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in a Dounce apparatus in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer containing no detergent. As indicated, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope (9E10), Cell Culture Center; monoclonal antibody to the hemagglutinin epitope (12CA5), Berkeley Antibody Co.; anti-ERK1 antibody Y691, raised as described (22Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); anti-phospho-ERK antibodies, Promega and New England Biolabs Inc.; anti-Raf-1 antibody (SC-133), Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-Elk-1 antibody, New England Biolabs Inc. To detect overexpressed or endogenous proteins, ∼20 μg of cell lysates were loaded and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose paper. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Proteins precipitated from 0.2 ml of cell lysates with 2 μl of antibody and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were used for immune complex kinase assays. Beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1m NaCl and once with 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), and 10 mm MgCl2. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 0.4 ml of cell lysates were mixed with 4 μl of antibody and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated at 4 °C for a total of 2 h. The beads were washed three times with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mNaCl, and 0.1 m MgCl2 and suspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. Several substrates of the MAP kinase ERK2, including the ternary complex factor Elk-1, contain a targeting domain (D domain) for ERK2 that is required for their efficient phosphorylation and activation (23Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase kinase MEK1 is the physiological upstream enzyme for ERK2. MEK1 binds to ERK2 via its N-terminal 32 amino acids (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Within the MEK1 N terminus, there is a sequence that resembles a D domain motif. Because MEK1 is also a substrate for ERK2 both in vitro and in vivo (15Mansour S.J. Resing K.A. Candia J.M. Hermann A.S. Gloor J.W. Herskind K.R. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Ahn N.G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt R.R.

Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we asked if deletion of the ERK-binding domain of MEK1 affected its phosphorylation by ERK2. His-tagged, bacterially expressed, kinase-dead full-length MEK1 and an N-terminal deletion mutant (MEK1-ΔN1) lacking residues 1–32 were used as substrates for active ERK2 (Fig.1 A). In the time course of Fig. 2 A, phosphorylation of the N-terminal deletion mutant ΔN1 by ERK2 was much reduced compared with that of full-length MEK1; after 90 min, maximal phosphorylation of ΔN1 was only ∼25% of that of full-length MEK1. When increasing concentrations of MEK1 proteins from 10 to 350 nm were used in the kinase reactions, phosphorylation of full-length MEK1 by 16 nm ERK2 was greater than that of ΔN1 at equivalent concentrations (Fig. 2 B). The data suggest that phosphorylation of ΔN1 is still in the linear range even at 350 nm. These results indicate that the ERK-binding domain enhances the rate of feedback phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2.Figure 2Deletion of the N-terminal ERK-binding domain of MEK1 reduces its phosphorylation by ERK2. A, time course of phosphorylation of full-length MEK1-K97M (FL) and MEK1-ΔN1 K97M by active ERK2. MEK1 proteins (180 nm) were phosphorylated by 16 nm active ERK2 for the indicated times.

One of two similar experiments is shown. The increase in phosphorylation of ΔN1 by PAK at 60 min was observed in both experiments. Its significance is unknown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The p21-activated protein kinase PAK1 phosphorylates MEK1 on Ser298 in vitro and in vivo (11Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P.S. Lewis R. Ahn J. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To show that the ERK-binding domain is not required for MEK1 phosphorylation by other protein kinases, constitutively active, recombinant PAK1 was used to phosphorylate full-length MEK1 and ΔN1in vitro (Fig. 2 C). Whereas ERK2 phosphorylated MEK1 to a higher extent than ΔN1 over the time course examined, PAK1 phosphorylated ΔN1 MEK1 at least as well as full-length MEK1. This indicates that deletion of the ERK-binding domain from MEK1 does not impair its phosphorylation by other protein kinases. To gain further evidence that the ERK-binding domain of MEK1 is required for its efficient phosphorylation by ERK2, two MEK1 N-terminal peptides were used as competitors in the kinase assays. Peptide P1 (residues 3–22) contains the ERK-binding domain, whereas the control peptide P2, which contains three N-terminal arginines linked to residues 11–27 of MEK1, is C-terminal to the binding domain, but overlaps P1 within the deleted region (Fig. 1 B). As expected, P1 inhibited phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Consistent with these results, P1 has little effect on phosphorylation of MEK1-ΔN1 by ERK2 (data not shown). Significant inhibition of phosphorylation of full-length MEK1 by ERK2 was observed with as little as 20 μm P1. On the other hand, P2 had little effect on MEK1 phosphorylation by ERK2 even at 200 μm. This result shows that a peptide containing the ERK-binding domain itself can efficiently inhibit phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2, suggesting that the ERK-binding domain can compete with MEK1 for binding to ERK2. To demonstrate the specificity of inhibition, the ability of the peptide to block MEK1 phosphorylation by PAK1 was tested (Fig.3 B). Whereas clear inhibition was observed for phosphorylation by ERK2, little or no inhibition was observed with PAK1 even with 100 μm P1. This supports the conclusion that the effect of P1 is not on MEK1 itself, but on its interaction with ERK2. To test whether P1 can inhibit ERK2 activity toward other substrates, the effect of P1 on phosphorylation of MBP and the ternary complex factor Elk-1 by ERK2 was assessed (Fig. 3 C). Even 200 μm P1 had little effect on phosphorylation of MBP by ERK2. This indicates that P1 is not a general inhibitor of ERK2, independent of substrate. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Elk-1, which is targeted to ERK2 by a D domain and a second targeting domain (25Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), was inhibited partially at 200 μm, the highest concentration of P1 tested. ERK2 phosphorylates Thr292, which is located within the MEK1 proline-rich insert, and Thr386, which is near its C terminus. P1 at 100 μm reduced MEK1 phosphorylation by ERK2 to ∼25% of that without P1. To investigate whether phosphorylation of both Thr292 and Thr386 is inhibited by P1, we used the T292A and T386A mutants as substrates for ERK2 in the presence or absence of 100 μm P1 (Fig.4). P1 strongly inhibited ERK2 phosphorylation of both residues of MEK1 because MEK1-T386A and MEK1-T292A were each phosphorylated less well in the presence of 100 μm P1. Thus far, we have shown that the MEK1 N-terminal ERK-binding domain is required for the efficient phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2. Because ERK2 is a physiological substrate of MEK1, we wanted to test whether deletion of the ERK2-binding domain of MEK1 would diminish its phosphorylation and activation of ERK2. Equal amounts of overexpressed, Myc-tagged full-length MEK1 and MEK1-ΔN1 were immunoprecipitated from 293 cells and used in vitro to phosphorylate GST-ERK2-K52R (Fig. 5, A and B). Wild-type MEK1 had significantly higher activity toward ERK2 than did ΔN1 isolated from either unstimulated or EGF-stimulated cells. We considered the possibility that deleting residues 1–32 of MEK1 might reduce its intrinsic activity toward ERK2, thereby decreasing the extent of its activation (19Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This is unlikely to contribute significantly to reduced ERK activation because, as shown in Fig. 7, ΔN1 phosphorylated a protein lacking a putative docking site on ERK2 (p38IIERK2, see below) nearly as well as did full-length MEK1 when each was immunoprecipitated from EGF-treated cells. Thus, the difference in activity in vitro and in transfected cells appears to be due to an impaired ability to bind to ERK2 rather than a large difference in intrinsic activity of ΔN1. This result shows that deletion of the ERK-binding domain of MEK1 not only reduces the feedback phosphorylation by ERK2, but also reduces the ability of MEK1 to phosphorylate ERK2 in vitro.Figure 7A MEK1-binding site of ERK2 is localized to its N terminus. Three ERK2-p38 chimeras and the ERK2 deletion mutant are shown schematically in the lower panel. The chimeras and wild-type ERK2 (each at 240 nm) and the deletion mutant (at 125 nm) were phosphorylated for 30 min at 30 °C by wild-type full-length MEK1 and MEK1-ΔN1 immunoprecipitated from EGF-stimulated 293 cells. Incorporation by ΔN1 is plotted as percent incorporation due to full-length MEK1; counts/min due to ERK2 and chimera autophosphorylation were subtracted from the total incorporation. Solid bars, full-length MEK1;hatched bars, MEK1-ΔN1. The number of experiments for each ERK2 or chimeric protein is shown in parentheses above thehatched bars. The rates of phosphorylation of these proteins relative to wild-type ERK2 are as follows: p38IIERK2 (PIIE), 10%; p38IVERK2 (PIVE), 100%; ERK2IIp38IVERK2 (EIIPIVE), 30%; and ERK2–337 (337), 5–10% (see Ref. 21Wilsbacher J. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether the ERK-binding domain is important for endogenous ERK activation, the effects of Myc-tagged full-length MEK1 and ΔN1 were tested in transiently transfected 293 cells (Fig. 5,C and D). EGF stimulated the activation of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2, measured by blotting lysates with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2. Expression of full-length MEK1 in the cells had little or no effect on ERK activity in the presence or absence of EGF. However, in cells expressing ΔN1, ERK activation by EGF was significantly less than that in cells expressing MEK1 or the vector control. This inhibitory effect is probably due to sequestering of endogenous Raf-1 by ΔN1, preventing its activation of endogenous MEK. These results indicate that the ability to activate endogenous ERK proteins is impaired by the deletion of the ERK-binding domain of MEK1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the N-terminal ERK-binding domain of MEK1 enhances not only efficient feedback phosphorylation by ERK2, but also phosphorylation and activation of ERK2 by MEK1. We have suggested that ΔN1 phosphorylates ERK2 less well than MEK1 because it binds less well to ERK2. To obtain additional evidence in support of this conclusion, we tested the ability of wild-type MEK1 and ΔN1 to co-immunoprecipitate with ERK2 from transfected cells. The data of Fig. 6 A demonstrate that whereas wild-type full-length MEK1 brings down detectable amounts of ERK2, ΔN1 does not. In agreement with the in vitroexperiments of Fukuda et al. (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), these results indicate that in cells ERK2 binds to MEK1 through its N-terminal 32 residues. MEK1 associates with its substrates ERK1 and ERK2 as well as its upstream activator Raf-1 in cells. The N terminus of MEK1 contains the ERK-binding domain, but the region of MEK1 that interacts with Raf-1 has not been delineated. We wanted to examine whether deletion of the ERK-binding domain of MEK1 affected its association with endogenous Raf-1. Equal amounts of Myc-tagged MEK1 and MEK1-ΔN1 were immunoprecipitated from transfected cells using an anti-Myc antibody, and the precipitates were blotted for the presence of endogenous Raf-1 (Fig. 6 B). Raf-1 co-immunoprecipitated with MEK1-ΔN1 as well as it did with full-length MEK1, indicating that the N-terminal ERK-binding domain is not required for Raf-1 association. This supports the idea that ΔN1 may interfere with ERK activation by competing with endogenous MEK1 for association with Raf-1. The N terminus of MEK1 contains the ERK-binding domain. To localize the MEK1-interacting domain of ERK2, we used three ERK2-p38 chimeras and an ERK2 deletion mutant along with full-length ERK2 asin vitro substrates for MEK1 and ΔN1 (Fig.7). As shown above, under these conditions, ERK2 was more highly phosphorylated by wild-type full-length MEK1 than by ΔN1. However, if the MEK1-interacting domain of ERK2 were replaced by sequences from the p38 MAP kinase, the resulting chimera should be phosphorylated by both wild-type MEK1 and ΔN1 to similar extents. Based on this rationale, we compared three different ERK2-p38 chimeras and an ERK2 C-terminal deletion mutant asin vitro substrates for immunoprecipitated MEK1 proteins (Fig. 7). p38IIERK2 contains ERK2 with its N terminus through the end of subdomain II replaced by p38; ERK2IIp38IVERK2 contains ERK2 with p38 substituted for subdomains III and IV; p38IVERK2 contains p38 substituted for ERK2 from the N terminus through subdomain IV; and ERK2–337 lacks the C-terminal 21 residues from ERK2. When equal amounts of Myc-tagged MEK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from EGF-treated 293 cell lysates and used to phosphorylate these proteins, full-length MEK1 had 5-fold more activity than did ΔN1 toward wild-type ERK2, as expected. However, the difference between full-length MEK1 and ΔN1 in phosphorylation of the chimeras p38IIERK2 and p38IVERK2, which have the p38 N terminus, was much smaller. The chimera retaining the ERK2 N terminus, ERK2IIp38IVERK2, was phosphorylated better by full-length MEK1 than by ΔN1. These data suggest that a MEK1-interacting domain of ERK2 is located at its N terminus. The results with the ERK2 deletion mutant are consistent with this notion and suggest that the C terminus of ERK2 is not involved because full-length MEK1 phosphorylated ERK2 lacking the C terminus significantly better than did ΔN1. We show here that a binding site for ERK2 at the N terminus of MEK1 enhances not only the feedback phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2, but also the activation of ERK2 by MEK1 in vitro and in cells. The reduced rate of phosphorylation of MEK1 lacking the binding site is not due to conformational changes that would alter phosphorylation of MEK1 by kinases other than ERK2 because PAK1, another protein kinase that phosphorylates MEK1, phosphorylates MEK1 equally well in the presence or absence of the ERK-binding site. The inhibition of EGF-stimulated ERK2 phosphorylation in cells expressing MEK1 that lacks this interacting domain indicates that the domain is also necessary for activation of ERK2 by MEK1 in intact cells. These results are consistent with a recent report examining the function of the MEK1 N terminus (26Gotoh I. Fukuda M. Adachi M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11874-11880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Multiple domains of MEK1 have now been shown to be important for activation of downstream ERK proteins in vivo. Specialized domains of MEK1 facilitate productive interactions among components of the cascade. These domains, including the MEK1 N terminus and its proline-rich insert, each appear to participate in protein-protein interactions that together serve to colocalize the cascade components in cells (9Dang A. Frost J.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19909-19913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the first identified protein kinase cascade, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activates phosphorylase kinase, which activates phosphorylase (27Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Moving down the cascade, each kinase or substrate is ∼10-fold more abundant than its upstream activator. Thus, 1:1 complexes of the proteins in the cascade would not be observed. In contrast, in the ERK/MAP kinase cascade, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 are present at roughly equimolar concentrations (MEK is in excess in at least a few cells (8Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar)), and their coprecipitation andin vitro binding suggest that they are associated to some extent in cells. The formation of 1:1 complexes of MEK and ERK is undoubtedly important for appropriate regulation of the MAP kinase pathway. For example, Fukuda et al. (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have suggested that ERK-MEK association contributes to the regulated nuclear accumulation of ERK2. The sequence of the binding site on MEK1 displays features characteristic of the D domain, a substrate-targeting domain for certain members of the MAP kinase family. Hallmarks of this domain are a cluster of basic residues and two leucine or isoleucine residues (see Fig. 1 B, for example) (28Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of a MEK1-derived peptide containing this binding site on phosphorylation of other substrates by ERK2 to test the possibility that ERK2 binds to MEK1 in a manner comparable to the binding of a substrate. A peptide containing the binding site did not inhibit phosphorylation of MBP, which is not believed to contain any targeting domain, but did weakly inhibit phosphorylation of Elk-1, which contains both D and FXFP-targeting domains (25Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). This provides support for the idea that the ERK2-binding site of MEK1 employs a substrate-targeting domain to bind to ERK2. Two possible explanations for the difference in inhibition seem likely. First, because Elk-1 contains an independent type of targeting sequence, interference through a D domain peptide is not sufficient to cause such great inhibition. Second, the site of binding of the D domain to ERK2 has not been unequivocally determined; two sites may exist, one within the catalytic domain and one that has been specialized for MEK recognition and that may be located at the N terminus, as suggested by our results. Other MAP kinases also recognize targeting domains to generate high affinity interactions with substrates. Karin and co-workers (29Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M.

The difference was due to the presence or absence of a targeting domain in the substrate, just N-terminal to its phosphorylation sites, that bound to the kinase. They subsequently showed that this region of c-Jun bound with higher affinity to a particular splice variant of the Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase that contained an insert between subdomains IX and X in the C-terminal portion of the kinase catalytic core (30Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Based on three-dimensional structures of protein kinases (31Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 32Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), this part of the catalytic domain is involved in binding protein substrates. Therefore, these findings suggested that the targeting domain of a substrate recognized a particular sequence within the kinase catalytic core, the normal function of which was to recognize protein substrates. Our results with ERK2-p38 chimeras and a deletion mutant indicate that a D domain-like sequence of MEK1 binds to ERK2 at least in part through an N-terminal sequence of ERK2. Our findings are consistent with those of Bardwell et al. (33Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,34Bardwell L. Thorner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 373-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), who reported that yeast MAP kinases interact with the yeast MEK Ste7p through residues outside its catalytic domain. Thus, it may be possible that substrate-interacting domains bind to their cognate protein kinases in regions outside the kinase active site or catalytic core. Support for this idea comes from the fact that substrate-targeting domains like the D domain may have any number of orientations relative to the sites that are phosphorylated by the kinase (25Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 28Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Reports on protein kinases such as myosin light chain kinase suggest that sequences outside the catalytic core are also important for recognition of their substrates (35Leachman S.A. Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. McPhaul M.J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4930-4938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, future experiments will explore the possibility that MAP kinases may bind substrates through accessory sequences outside the catalytic domain.

https://openalex.org/W1995966523,"Long chain acyl-CoA esters are important intermediates in degradation and synthesis of fatty acids, as well as having important functions in regulation of intermediary metabolism and gene expression. Although the physiological functions for most acyl-CoA thioesterases have not yet been elucidated, previous data suggest that these enzymes may be involved in lipid metabolism by modulation of cellular concentrations of acyl-CoAs and fatty acids. In line with this, we have cloned four highly homologous acyl-CoA thioesterase genes from mouse, showing multiple compartmental localizations. The nomenclature for these genes has tentatively been assigned as CTE-I (cytosolic), MTE-I (mitochondrial), and PTE-Ia and Ib (peroxisomal), based on the identification of putative targeting signals. Although the various isoenzymes show between 67% and 94% identity at amino acid level, each individual enzyme shows a specific tissue expression. Our data suggest that all four genes are located within a very narrow cluster on chromosome 12 in mouse, similar to a sequence cluster on human chromosome 14, which identified four genes homologous to the mouse thioesterase genes. Four related genes were also identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, all containing putative PTS1 targeting signals, suggesting that the ancestral type I thioesterase gene(s) is/are of peroxisomal origin. All four thioesterases are differentially expressed in tissues examined, but all are inducible at mRNA level by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator clofibrate, or during the physiological condition of fasting, both of which conditions cause a perturbation in overall lipid homeostasis. These results strongly support the existence of a novel multi-gene family cluster of mouse acyl-CoA thioesterases, each with a distinct function in lipid metabolism.

Acyl-CoAs also act as potent feedback inhibitors of,e.g., fatty acid synthesis, competitive inhibitors of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (2Li Q. Yamamoto N. Morisawa S. Inoue A. J. Cell.

Although this enzyme activity has been shown to be widely distributed among organisms and cell types, the physiological functions are known only in a few cases. Treatment of rats and mice with peroxisome proliferators strongly induces long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase activity in the liver (4Miyazawa S. Furuta S. Hashimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Berge R.K. Skrede S. Farstad M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two apparent peroxisome proliferator-inducible acyl-CoA thioesterase protein families of approximately 40 and 110–150 kDa were previously identified, which were expressed in cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes and which were only weakly expressed in the liver under normal conditions (6Svensson L.T. Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight enzymes were tentatively named CTE-I and MTE-I, corresponding to the cytosolic and mitochondrial counterparts, respectively. Purification of the mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase identified a monomeric protein of about 45 kDa (7Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12177-12183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibodies to MTE-I cross-reacted with proteins of similar, but not identical, molecular masses in cytosol and peroxisomes isolated from peroxisome proliferator-treated rats, suggesting the existence of a structurally related family of acyl-CoA thioesterases with multiple subcellular localizations (7Svensson L.T.

The cDNAs corresponding to both CTE-I and MTE-I from rat and CTE-I from mouse were recently cloned (8Svensson L.T. Engberg S.T. Aoyama T. Usuda N. Alexson S.E.H. Hashimoto T. Biochem.

Commun. 1998; 248: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Studies on the regulation of expression of CTE-I and MTE-I verified that both enzymes are strongly induced by feeding peroxisome proliferators to rodents, but interestingly fasting was also found to induce the mRNA levels to a similar extent as clofibrate feeding (9Lindquist P.J.G. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Peroxisome proliferators comprise a chemically heterogeneous class of compounds that exert hypolipidemic effects, which are mediated by changes at the transcriptional level (for review, see Ref. 11Schoonjans K.

Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar), which is activated by various peroxisome proliferators, was shown to mediate activation of transcription of several genes encoding peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes, as well as cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum proteins (13Bardot O.

The PPARα heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promotor region of target genes (19Gearing K.L. Göttlicher M. Teboul M. Widmark E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1440-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The important role of the PPARα in lipid metabolism was demonstrated by targeted disruption of the gene (20Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). The PPARα-null mice do not respond to peroxisome proliferators with the usual parameters of hepatomegaly, peroxisome proliferation, hepatocarcinogenesis, and induction of lipid metabolizing enzymes. Free fatty acids are proposed to be the physiological activators of the PPARα, as they have been shown to bind to and activate transcription via the PPARα (21Göttlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q.

Based on this we hypothesized that enzymes affecting acyl-CoA/free fatty acid levels may regulate lipid metabolism as well as several other cellular functions at the substrate and gene transcription levels. Accordingly, we describe the cloning of four acyl-CoA thioesterase genes, which catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl CoAs to free fatty acids and CoA and which therefore could be involved in regulation of acyl-CoA/free fatty acid levels in vivo. Two of these genes encode CTE-I and MTE-I, with two further genes encoding putative peroxisomal thioesterases (PTE-Ia and PTE-Ib), forming a novel family of highly conserved genes localized in a cluster on mouse chromosome 12. The expression of the genes shows a remarkable pattern of tissue specificity, and all are highly regulated by feeding peroxisome proliferators and by fasting, strongly connecting them to lipid metabolism.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and TreatmentsAdult male C57 BL/6 mice, obtained from B & K, Sollentuna, Sweden, or F4 C57BL/6N (produced on an Sv/129 background as described; Ref. 20Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) were used throughout this study. Mice were maintained on a standard chow diet (R36, Lactamin, Vadstena, Sweden) before commencement of the treatments, where mice were fed a diet containing 0.5% clofibrate or were fasted for 24 h as indicated in the figure legends. Alternatively mice were fasted for 24 h and refed a 0.5% clofibrate-containing diet for the time points indicated. All mice had access to water ad libitum. The animals were euthanized by CO2 treatment, followed by cervical dislocation, and weighed immediately. The various tissues were then excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were stored at −70 °C until further analysis.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from mouse tissue samples using either QuickPrepR total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Ultraspec RNA kit (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.). Total RNA (either 10 or 20 μg as outlined in figure legends) was denatured in formaldehyde/formamide and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action using Northern blotting technique. A full-length cDNA probe for mouse CTE-I was prepared as described (9Lindquist P.J.G. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An MTE-I probe corresponding to the mitochondrial leader peptide of the rat MTE-I cDNA sequence (8Svensson L.T. Engberg S.T. Aoyama T. Usuda N. Alexson S.E.H. Hashimoto T. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was prepared by restriction enzyme digestion of the full-length cDNA for MTE-I. cDNA probes were prepared for PTE-Ia (a 646-bp fragment corresponding to an area in the 3′-untranslated region) and PTE-Ib (a 548-bp fragment corresponding to amino acids 212–393 of the open reading frame) by PCR amplification. A probe for β-actin was also used. All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products, Belgium) by random priming (Oligolabeling Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nylon membranes were pre-hybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in a solution of 50 mm Pipes, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% SDS at pH 6.8, together with 100 μg salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and further hybridized overnight at 65 °C with the specific α-32P-labeled cDNA probe. Following hybridization, the filters were washed at 65 °C in 1× SSC, 5% SDS and further in decreasing concentrations of SSC/SDS solutions and were subsequently exposed to x-ray film (CEA RP medical x-ray screen film). The filters were stripped in boiling 0.5% SDS solution and re-probed as above.cDNA IdentificationThe cDNA corresponding to the mouse cytosolic acyl-CoA thioesterase (mCTE-I) was recently reported (9Lindquist P.J.G. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Searches in the mouse EST data base using this sequence as a query revealed other ESTs (expressed sequence tags) of high similarity. The corresponding clones were obtained from the United Kingdom Human Genome Mapping Project (HGMP) Resource Center (Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and were completely sequenced. None of the clones contained an entire open reading frame. Two of the cDNAs (GenBank accession nos. AA571285and AA575425) were assumed to encode peroxisomal isoforms (based on the presence of putative peroxisomal targeting signals in the COOH-terminal ends) and cDNA probes were prepared for the screening of the genes as described below. The sequence of one cDNA (GenBank accession no.AA268889) contained a PTS2-like sequence in the amino-terminal end but also contained several stop codons, which would result in a substantially truncated protein, and was therefore not further characterized.Cloning of the Acyl-CoA Thioesterase GenesCTE-I GeneApproximately 2 × 106 plaques of a mouse genomic λ-Zap library (Stratagene) were screened with a cDNA probe containing about 2/3 (3′) of the cDNA sequence of mouse CTE-I. Two hundred and eight positive clones were isolated, of which 30 were rescreened twice, with 90% of the clones remaining positive after the three rounds of screening. Two clones were partially sequenced and identified to contain the CTE-I gene, and one exon/intron boundary was sequenced. Primers were generated for PCR-based screening of mouse P1 clones (ES 129 strain) which was carried out by Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). One PCR primer was selected in the first exon (5′-GGTCGAGATGGAGGCGACGCT-3′) and the other primer selected in the first intron (5′-AGCGTCGCCTCCATCTCGACC-3′). This screening resulted in one positive clone, which contained the entire open reading frame of CTE-I, and this clone was used to sequence the entire gene.MTE-I GeneA “mini-library” was prepared by pooling all 208 positive clones isolated from the first screening with the partial CTE-I cDNA probe, as described above. This mini-library was screened for MTE-I genomic clones using an MTE-I cDNA probe corresponding to the amino-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence. Nine positive clones were isolated and rescreened, and one clone was completely sequenced and found to contain the entire gene.PTE-I GenesPTE-I cDNA probes were prepared and used to rescreen the mini-library as described above. Eight positive clones were isolated for both PTE-Ia and PTE-Ib, all of which were rescreened twice. One genomic clone was sequenced for each PTE-I gene, which in each case contained the entire open reading frame.All sequence reactions were carried out using the ABI Prism dye terminator ready-reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) or Big-Dye Prime kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) at Cybergene AB (Huddinge, Sweden) in an ABI 373A DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence analysis was performed using the LaserGene software package (DNAStar), Clustal X, and the Phylip package.Southern Blot AnalysisRestriction enzyme digestions were carried out on approximately 10 μg of mouse genomic DNA (NIH Swiss Strain, Promega Corp.) or 1 μg of Pl-phage DNA (containing the CTE-I gene) with EcoRI or XhoI and BglI, respectively, as indicated in figure legends. The digested DNA was electrophoresed in 0.7% and 1% agarose gels, respectively, and transferred to nylon membranes by capillary transfer. The membranes were probed with α-32P-labeled DNA probes to CTE-I (a specific probe of 307 bp prepared 5′ of the ATG start site, corresponding to −34 to −340 of the promotor region), and probes for MTE-I and PTE-Ia and Ib as described above.Cloning of the Promotor Region of CTE-IApproximately 2.4 kb of the 5′-flanking region of CTE-I was sequenced in both sense and antisense directions. Oligonucleotides were designed for PCR amplification of a fragment of the promotor region of CTE-I based on the sequences corresponding to an area 57 bp 3′ of the ATG start site (5′-AGGCTTCAGCGGTTCGTCCCAGCAG-3′) and 2,378 bp 5′ of the ATG start site (5′-AGGCTTTGTGGAGAGCAGGGGTTTG-3′), with the addition of HindIII restriction enzyme sites (indicated in bold). PCR was carried out using GeneAmp XL-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) in an Eppendorf DNA thermal cycler at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min, using the P1 phage DNA as a template. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR-Script AMP (SK+) vector (Stratagene) and further cloned into the promotorless pGL3 Basic luciferase vector (Promega Corp.) and subsequently partially sequenced to confirm cloning in the correct orientation.Functionality of CTE-I Promotor in HepG2 CellsHepG2 cells were routinely subcultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin/streptomycin/gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The day before transfection, the cells were plated out in 60-mm culture dishes and grown to approximately 80% confluence. Cells were transfected using Tfx-50 (Promega Corp.) with 4 μg of CTE-I promotor in pGL3 Basic luciferase reporter plasmid or empty pGL3 Basic luciferase reporter plasmid as a negative control. Transfections were carried out in duplicate and were repeated three times. After 48 h, cells were harvested for assay of luciferase activity using luciferase reporter gene assay (Promega Corp.). Acyl-CoAs play important roles in the degradation and synthesis of fatty acids and in their incorporation into complex lipids (for review, see Ref. 1Waku K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoAs also act as potent feedback inhibitors of,e.g., fatty acid synthesis, competitive inhibitors of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (2Li Q. Yamamoto N. Morisawa S. Inoue A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and act as ligands for the hepatic nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α)1 (3Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Fatty acids entering cells are rapidly esterified to the corresponding CoA-esters, which are oxidized in mitochondria or peroxisomes, elongated, and desaturated or esterified into complex lipids or post-translationally to proteins. Acyl-CoA thioesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths to free fatty acids and CoASH. Although this enzyme activity has been shown to be widely distributed among organisms and cell types, the physiological functions are known only in a few cases. Treatment of rats and mice with peroxisome proliferators strongly induces long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase activity in the liver (4Miyazawa S. Furuta S. Hashimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Berge R.K. Skrede S. Farstad M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two apparent peroxisome proliferator-inducible acyl-CoA thioesterase protein families of approximately 40 and 110–150 kDa were previously identified, which were expressed in cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes and which were only weakly expressed in the liver under normal conditions (6Svensson L.T. Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight enzymes were tentatively named CTE-I and MTE-I, corresponding to the cytosolic and mitochondrial counterparts, respectively. Purification of the mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase identified a monomeric protein of about 45 kDa (7Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12177-12183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibodies to MTE-I cross-reacted with proteins of similar, but not identical, molecular masses in cytosol and peroxisomes isolated from peroxisome proliferator-treated rats, suggesting the existence of a structurally related family of acyl-CoA thioesterases with multiple subcellular localizations (7Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12177-12183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cDNAs corresponding to both CTE-I and MTE-I from rat and CTE-I from mouse were recently cloned (8Svensson L.T. Engberg S.T. Aoyama T. Usuda N. Alexson S.E.H. Hashimoto T. Biochem.

Studies on the regulation of expression of CTE-I and MTE-I verified that both enzymes are strongly induced by feeding peroxisome proliferators to rodents, but interestingly fasting was also found to induce the mRNA levels to a similar extent as clofibrate feeding (9Lindquist P.J.G. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferators comprise a chemically heterogeneous class of compounds that exert hypolipidemic effects, which are mediated by changes at the transcriptional level (for review, see Ref. 11Schoonjans K.

Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar), which is activated by various peroxisome proliferators, was shown to mediate activation of transcription of several genes encoding peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes, as well as cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum proteins (13Bardot O.

The PPARα heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promotor region of target genes (19Gearing K.L. Göttlicher M. Teboul M. Widmark E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1440-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The important role of the PPARα in lipid metabolism was demonstrated by targeted disruption of the gene (20Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). The PPARα-null mice do not respond to peroxisome proliferators with the usual parameters of hepatomegaly, peroxisome proliferation, hepatocarcinogenesis, and induction of lipid metabolizing enzymes. Free fatty acids are proposed to be the physiological activators of the PPARα, as they have been shown to bind to and activate transcription via the PPARα (21Göttlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q.

Based on this we hypothesized that enzymes affecting acyl-CoA/free fatty acid levels may regulate lipid metabolism as well as several other cellular functions at the substrate and gene transcription levels. Accordingly, we describe the cloning of four acyl-CoA thioesterase genes, which catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl CoAs to free fatty acids and CoA and which therefore could be involved in regulation of acyl-CoA/free fatty acid levels in vivo. Two of these genes encode CTE-I and MTE-I, with two further genes encoding putative peroxisomal thioesterases (PTE-Ia and PTE-Ib), forming a novel family of highly conserved genes localized in a cluster on mouse chromosome 12. The expression of the genes shows a remarkable pattern of tissue specificity, and all are highly regulated by feeding peroxisome proliferators and by fasting, strongly connecting them to lipid metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and TreatmentsAdult male C57 BL/6 mice, obtained from B & K, Sollentuna, Sweden, or F4 C57BL/6N (produced on an Sv/129 background as described; Ref. 20Lee S.S. Pineau T.

Mice were maintained on a standard chow diet (R36, Lactamin, Vadstena, Sweden) before commencement of the treatments, where mice were fed a diet containing 0.5% clofibrate or were fasted for 24 h as indicated in the figure legends. Alternatively mice were fasted for 24 h and refed a 0.5% clofibrate-containing diet for the time points indicated. All mice had access to water ad libitum. The animals were euthanized by CO2 treatment, followed by cervical dislocation, and weighed immediately. The various tissues were then excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were stored at −70 °C until further analysis.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from mouse tissue samples using either QuickPrepR total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Ultraspec RNA kit (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.). Total RNA (either 10 or 20 μg as outlined in figure legends) was denatured in formaldehyde/formamide and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action using Northern blotting technique. A full-length cDNA probe for mouse CTE-I was prepared as described (9Lindquist P.J.G"
https://openalex.org/W2158696091,"We recently observed that specific inhibitors of post-proline cleaving aminodipeptidases cause apoptosis in quiescent lymphocytes in a process independent of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV. These results led to the isolation and cloning of a new protease that we have termed quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP). QPP activity was purified from CD26− Jurkat T cells. The protein was identified by labeling with [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate and subjected to tryptic digestion and partial amino acid sequencing. The peptide sequences were used to identify expressed sequence tag clones. The cDNA of QPP contains an open reading frame of 1476 base pairs, coding for a protein of 492 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of QPP reveals similarity with prolylcarboxypeptidase. The putative active site residues serine, aspartic acid, and histidine of QPP show an ordering of the catalytic triad similar to that seen in the post-proline cleaving exopeptidases prolylcarboxypeptidase and CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV. The post-proline cleaving activity of QPP has an unusually broad pH range in that it is able to cleave substrate molecules at acidic pH as well as at neutral pH. QPP has also been detected in nonlymphocytic cell lines, indicating that this enzyme activity may play an important role in other tissues as well.

These include exopeptidases such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26/DPPIV),1 dipeptidyl peptidase II (DPPII), and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PCP, angiotensinase C; Ref. 1Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). CD26/DPPIV is a ubiquitously expressed molecule found on the cell membrane and in a secreted form (2Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 3von Bonin A. Huhn J. Fleischer B. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CD26 was recently shown to cleave dipeptides off the amino terminus of chemokines such as regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted, stromal-derived factor 1, and macrophage derived chemokine, altering the biological activity of these molecules (4Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G. Gorrell M.D. Ditto M. Nguyen N.Y. Boykins R. Unsworth E. Norcross M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 5Shioda T. Kato H.

DPPII has a similar substrate specificity to CD26/DPPIV but is only active at acidic pH (7Mentlein R. Struckhoff G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PCP, however, is a post-proline cleaving activity that liberates amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of proteins (8Tan F. Morris P.W. Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16631-16638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently observed that inhibitors of post-proline cleaving aminodipeptidases cause apoptosis in quiescent lymphocytes but not activated or transformed lymphocytes (9Chiravuri M. Schmitz T. Underwood R. Yardley K. Dayal Y. Huber B.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3092-3099PubMed Google Scholar). This apoptosis is not mediated by CD26, because CD26− and CD26+cells both undergo apoptosis in response to the addition of these inhibitors (9Chiravuri M. Schmitz T. Underwood R. Yardley K. Dayal Y. Huber B.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3092-3099PubMed Google Scholar). Closer analysis revealed an intracellular post-proline cleaving aminodipeptidase activity that was functional at neutral and acidic pH. In this paper we report the purification and sequence of a post-proline cleaving aminodipeptidase that we have termed quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), according to its functional properties. The post-proline cleaving activity was purified 1000-fold by following the cleavage of the reporter substrates Ala-Pro-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) and Gly-Pro-paranitroanilide (pNA). The active-site serine containing protein was identified by labeling with [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Peptide sequencing of this protein provided us with four peptides, which were used to identify cDNAs from the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base. The QPP cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1476 base pairs coding for a 492-amino acid protein. This protein has strong sequence homology with PCP but little similarity to CD26/DPPIV. We show that the QPP cDNA codes for a fully functional enzyme with Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity. Unlike the reported activity of DPPII and DPPIV (7Mentlein R. Struckhoff G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), however, QPP is active at both acidic and neutral pH. This enzyme may play a role in the regulation of the large number of proteins that contain a conserved amino-terminal Xaa-Pro motif (1Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The peptidase inhibitors Lys-thiazolidide, Lys-piperidide, and Val-boro-Pro (VbP) were provided by R. Snow (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT).l-125 was provided by J. T. Welch (State University New York, Albany, NY; see Fig. 1). Frozen pellets of Jurkat cells were provided by R. Barton (Boehringer Ingelheim). All chromatography media and Ficoll-Hypaque were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Aim V cell culture medium was purchased from Life Technologies. [3H]DFP and [3H]Enhance were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Ala-Pro-AFC and AFC were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent purchased from Pierce, and centrifugal concentrators were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) polymerase chain reaction was performed using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit, and human leukocyte Marathon-Ready cDNA was purchased fromCLONTECH. DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis was performed at the protein analysis facility (Tufts University). The TA cloning vector pCR2.1 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). All EST clones were purchased from ATCC. All additional reagents were purchased from Sigma. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; ∼4.3 × 108 cells) were isolated from 450 ml of whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. The PBMCs were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 7 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.02 m Tris, pH 7.8, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 8 μg/ml leupeptin, 8 μg/ml antipain, 5 mmEDTA) and lysed by Dounce homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 45,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The 110,000 × g supernatant (S-110) was used as a source of soluble cellular proteins. For preparation of S-110 from Jurkat cells, a 68 g (wet weight) frozen pellet of these cells was subjected to the same homogenization and centrifugation procedure used to prepare S-110 from PBMCs. For preparation of S-110 from 293T human fibroblasts expressing QPP cDNA, ∼1.8 × 108cells were lysed in 5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.02m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, instead of 0.02m Tris and then subjected to the same homogenization and centrifugation procedure used to prepare S-110 from PBMCs. 30 ml of Jurkat S-110 (corresponding to 17 g of cells) was dialyzed (molecular mass cutoff, 2 kDa) overnight at 4 °C against 4 liters of 50 mm acetic acid, titrated to pH 4.5 with NaOH. The protein sample was clarified by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was concentrated on a Centricon 50 membrane to ∼10 ml. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a 3-ml HiTrap SP-Sepharose column and equilibrated with 50 mm acetate, pH 4.5 (start buffer). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of start buffer and eluted with a linear 0–300 mm NaCl gradient in start buffer. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for cleavage of Gly-Pro-pNA. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼1 ml on a Centricon 50 membrane and then to ∼0.2 ml on a Microcon 30 membrane. The concentrated material was loaded onto a Superdex 12 gel filtration column and equilibrated with 50 mm acetate, pH 4.5, 150 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for Gly-Pro-pNA cleavage. Active fractions were pooled and used as a purified preparation of the activity. The soluble Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity of the QPP cDNA-transfected 293T human fibroblasts was partially purified by using a gel filtration column and then an ion exchange column, in a similar manner as above. CD26/DPPIV was purified from pig kidney as described previously (10Seidl R. Schaefer W. Prep. Biochem. 1991; 21: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar). 5 mg (total protein) of purified Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity was mixed with [3H]DFP (specific activity 8.4, Ci/mmol) at a final concentration of 12 mm in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. SDS loading buffer was added, and the reaction was boiled and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). A control reaction without [3H]DFP was run in parallel on the same gel. The control lane was silver-stained, and the labeled lane was equilibrated first in [3H]Enhance and then 3% glycerol. The gels were dried, and the labeled gel was exposed to film. DPPIV-like activity was assayed by fluorogenic or chromogenic assays. In the fluorescence assay, peptidase activity was measured by monitoring the accumulation of AFC liberated from the substrate Ala-Pro-AFC for 1 min, using a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrometer (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). Assays were carried out in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 μm Ala-Pro-AFC. In the chromogenic assay, pNA liberated from the substrate Gly-Pro-pNA (1 mm) was measured by absorbance at 410 nm. Plates were read on an MR700 plate reader (Dynatech Inc.). The K m for the cleavage of Ala-Pro-AFC was determined by assaying a standard amount of activity at several concentrations of substrate in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5.K m was calculated by standard transformation of the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation. The K i for VbP was determined by assaying a standard amount of Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity and several concentrations of inhibitor. Purified QPP was added to 150 μl of 20 μm Ala-Pro-AFC in one of the following buffers: 170 mm cacodylate buffer (pH range, 4.0–7.0, in increments of 0.5), 50 mm HEPES (pH range, 6.5–8.5, in increments of 0.5), and 50 mm HEPBS (pH range, 7.5–9.0, in increments of 0.5). The liberation of AFC from the substrate Ala-Pro-AFC was measured using a fluorescent plate reader at excitation 390 nm and emission 510 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To prepare QPP for tryptic digestion and amino acid sequence analysis, the active fractions from the Superdex 12 column were concentrated to ∼60 μl and neutralized by the addition of 5 μl 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8. SDS loading buffer was added, and the sample was boiled before separation by SDS-PAGE. After running, the gel was fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 15 min and then stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The 55-kDa band was excised and washed with water and with 50% high-performance liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile. The final wash was decanted, and the gel slice was snap-frozen in N2. Peptide sequences were used to identify homologous proteins and EST clones using BLAST at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Searches of Swissprot for proteins with homology to QPP were performed using FASTA3 at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Multiple alignment of homologous sequences was performed using CLUSTAL W at the European Bioinformatics Institute. EST 69230 was supplied in pBluescript atEcoRI-XhoI (ATCC). The 5′ end of the QPP cDNA was isolated from human leukocyte cDNA, using the Marathon 5′ RACE system. The primary amplification mixture contained 1 × polymerase chain reaction buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 mm primer AP1, 0.5 ng of adapter-ligated human leukocyte cDNA, 1 × KlenTaq polymerase mix, and 0.2 mmQPP-specific primer BBE1R (ACTCTGGCCCTCAAAGTCCGCCGTG). The products of this reaction were diluted 50-fold with 10 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 15 μl was used as template for a nested amplification, using 0.2 mm primer AP2, and 0.2 mm nested QPP-specific primer BBE2R (GCCGAGGCCTGCCACAGCTAGAACG). A prominent band of 600 base pairs was excised, extracted from the gel, and TA-cloned into pCR2.1. Several clones were isolated and sequenced. All contained ∼200 base pairs of 3′ sequence that overlapped with EST 69230. To assemble a full-length cDNA, EST 69230 was digested with NotI andMstII. The 5′ RACE product was excised from pCR2.1 by digestion with NotI and MstII. The 5′ RACE product and pBluescript containing the 3′ sequences of EST 69230 were gel purified and ligated together, generating a full-length cDNA in pBluescript. QPP cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with primers containingXhoI and EcoRI restriction sites using DeepVent polymerase (New England Biolabs). This was cloned into the pCI-neo expression vector (Promega) and transfected into 293T fibroblasts using the calcium phosphate method (11Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lysates from transient transfectants were assayed for Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity, as described above. Stable lines of 293T cells were used as a source of recombinant QPP for analysis of pH optima and inhibitor analysis. Total RNA was isolated from resting PBMCs and Jurkat cells using the TRIZOL kit (Life Technologies). 20 μg of total RNA per lane was loaded from each sample. 32P-labeled QPP cDNA was used to probe the Northern blot. Functional analyses revealed that culturing PBMCs with CD26/DPPIV inhibitors led to apoptosis in resting lymphocytes (9Chiravuri M. Schmitz T. Underwood R. Yardley K. Dayal Y. Huber B.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3092-3099PubMed Google Scholar). CD26/DPPIV, a T cell surface molecule, was excluded as a target for this death-inducing activity, because both CD26+ and CD26− lymphocytes were equally sensitive to apoptosis induction in the presence of the DPPIV inhibitors (9Chiravuri M. Schmitz T. Underwood R. Yardley K. Dayal Y. Huber B.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3092-3099PubMed Google Scholar). To search for a novel DPPIV-like activity, a soluble fraction of PBMCs was prepared. This fraction contained proteolytic activity that cleaved the CD26/DPPIV substrate Ala-Pro-AFC (data not shown). The activity was inhibited by VbP (Ref. 12Flentke G.R. Munoz E. Huber B.T. Plaut A.G. Kettner C.A. Bachovchin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1556-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 for structure) in the micromolar range but only partially inhibited by millimolar concentrations of serine- and cysteine-protease inhibitors with broad specificity (Table I). We analyzed the ability of various DPPIV inhibitors to block QPP activity. As can be seen in Table I, Lys-thiazolidide and Lys-piperidide inhibit QPP with similar K i values to VbP, whereasl-125 (see Fig. 1. for structure) does not.Table IInhibition profile of QPPInhibitorConcentration% Inhibition%VbP1 μm85Antipain1 mm0Leupeptin1 mm12Phenymethylsulfenyl fluoride1 mm36Benzamidine1 mm35N-ethylmaleimide1 mm27Iodoacetimide1 mm24CD26/DPPIV inhibitorsK i (nM)CD26QPPnmVbP2125Lys-thiazolidideND1-aND, not determined.145Lys-piperidideND300l-125188>10001-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Because PBMCs contain CD26+ cells, and a large quantity of blood would be required to isolate enough PBMCs to purify the activity, the soluble fraction of CD26− Jurkat T cells was used as a source for Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity. We analyzed theK m values of the purified Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activities from PBMCs and Jurkat T cells and found them to be similar. Both PBMC and Jurkat activities are inhibited by VbP with aK i of 125 nm (Fig.2 A). From these studies we concluded that the Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity found in the soluble fraction of PBMCs and Jurkat cells is attributable to the same enzyme, and we used Jurkat cells as a source of the activity for purification. The soluble Ala-Pro-AFC-cleavage activity, termed QPP, was purified from the soluble fraction of Jurkat cells by the removal of an acid-insoluble, denatured fraction, followed by column chromatography on SP-Sepharose and Superose 12. At each step fractions were assayed for cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Gly-Pro-pNA. Active fractions were combined and further purified. The Gly-Pro-pNA cleaving activity eluted as a single peak from all chromatography columns, and this scheme provided a 1000-fold purification of the activity with 27% yield (TableII). Acid precipitation removed ∼75% of the bulk protein with a 131% recovery of Ala-Pro-AFC-cleaving activity. This increased activity was most likely attributable to the removal of an acid-insoluble inhibitor. However, from the purification it is impossible to distinguish whether the cytosolic fraction contained inhibitors or natural substrates of QPP activity. Cellular substrates could compete with Ala-Pro-AFC, thus acting as competitive inhibitors. Similar to CD26/DPPIV, which cleaves amino-terminal dipeptides when the penultimate amino acid is proline or, to a lesser extent, alanine (13Heins J. Welker P. Schonlein C. Born I. Hartrodt B. Neubert K. Tsuru D. Barth A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the purified QPP activity is an amino dipeptidase that degrades substrates with prolyl and, to a lesser extent, alanyl residues in the penultimate position. Purified QPP activity is devoid of amino peptidase activity and does not cleave model substrates with blocked amino termini (Fig. 2 B).Table IIPurification of QPPFractionProteinActivity2-aUnits defined as the cleavage of 1 μmol of substrate/min.Specific activityPurificationYieldmgmUmU/mgfold%S-11048011192100Acetate1091466137131SupernatantSP599419910089SepharoseSuperdex-120.1530120071004272-a Units defined as the cleavage of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Open table in a new tab The Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity of purified QPP is active over a broad pH range, from acidic to neutral pH (pH 5.0–7.5; Fig.3). The Ala-Pro-AFC-cleaving activity is clearly detectable from pH 4.0–7.5. When incubated in 170 mm cacodylate buffer, a peak of maximum activity was detected at an acidic pH of 5.5, whereas a similar amount of activity was seen at pH 7.0 with HEPES buffer. The Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity was lower (69%) at pH 7.0 with the cacodylate buffer than the HEPES buffer, and this may be attributable to the fact that this pH is out of the range of the buffering capacity of cacodylate buffer. In both HEPES and HEPBS buffers the activity clearly drops off at pH 8.0 and is completely undetectable by pH 8.5. The activity eluted from gel filtration with an apparent molecular size of 120 kDa. SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of several polypeptides in the purified preparation but no polypeptide of 120 kDa (Fig.4 A), indicating that the native enzyme may be multimeric or exist as a complex. The catalytic polypeptide was identified using the irreversible inhibitor of serine-type proteases DFP. First, DFP was shown to inhibit the purified activity (Fig. 4 B), and then an aliquot of the purified activity was incubated with [3H]DFP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radiofluorography. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, a single polypeptide of 58 kDa was labeled compared with three bands seen by silver staining. The corresponding band was excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and submitted for tryptic digestion and amino acid sequence analysis (Harvard Microchemistry Facility). Four peptides were successfully isolated and sequenced (Fig.5 A). The peptide sequences were used as virtual probes to search translations of the EST data base. Four overlapping EST clones were identified and sequenced. The largest clone, EST 69230, contained 1.23 kilobases of sequence including a polyadenylation signal and poly(A) tail and encoded the three peptides obtained from the tryptic digest, GT69, GT103, and GT148. The 5′ end of the cDNA was isolated by RACE polymerase chain reaction from human leukocyte cDNA and was found to encode the fourth peptide, GT85. The RACE product was ligated to EST 69230 atMstII to form a full-length cDNA of 1.7 kilobases. The nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA encoding QPP was unambiguously determined by sequencing both strands. The cDNA encodes a protein of 492 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 54.3 kDa. It appears to contain the complete open reading frame, because the nucleotide sequence around the initiating methionine conforms to the Kozak consensus (14Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3577) Google Scholar), and the cDNA contains a polyadenylation signal and poly(A) tail. Furthermore, the QPP cDNA contains the consensus sequence for the active-site serine residue of serine-type proteases, Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly (Fig.5 A). As Fig. 5 B shows, QPP protein bears strong homology to PCP (Ref. 8Tan F. Morris P.W. Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16631-16638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 42% identity), particularly at the putative active site residues. It is interesting that these two post-proline cleaving enzymes have strong sequence homology, even though QPP is an aminodipeptidase, whereas PCP is a carboxypeptidase. QPP also shows homology to hypothetical proteins obtained from theCaenorhabditis elegans EST data base (Fig. 5 C). There is a remarkable conservation at and around the active-site residues, suggesting an evolutionary link. Northern blot analysis of Jurkat T cells and PBMCs shows that QPP is expressed in both of these cell types (Fig.6 A). Using a QPP cDNA probe the Northern analysis revealed a band of 1.7 kilobases that corresponds to QPP. To determine whether the QPP cDNA encodes an active protease, we transfected 293T human fibroblasts with QPP cDNA cloned into the pCIneo expression vector. Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity was measured from lysates of these samples at neutral pH. We found that extracts of fibroblasts transfected with the QPP cDNA contained severalfold higher specific Ala-Pro-AFC cleaving activity than cells transfected with the pCI-neo vector alone (Fig.6 B). Recombinant QPP exhibits a pH profile similar to that of native QPP (Fig. 3 B). The discrepency between the units of specific activity of the pH profiles of the native and recombinant QPP is attributable to the fact that the recombinant QPP was only partially purified. This presence of extraneous proteins results in a decrease in specific activity. However, the general trends of the pH profile mirror those of native QPP. Additionally, recombinant QPP has a similar K i for VbP as native QPP and exhibits the same level of inhibition with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fig.6 C). These results show that the cloned cDNA is full-length and encodes an active QPP protease, the activities and characteristics of which mimic the native QPP. QPP was biochemically purified from CD26/DPPIV−Jurkat cells, sequenced, and cloned. The translated product contains the consensus sequence for the active site of a serine-type protease, in agreement with the aminodipeptidase inhibitor profile. The purified activity eluted from gel filtration chromatography with an apparent molecular size of 120 kDa but ran as a [3H]DFP-labeled band of 58 kDa on SDS-PAGE, indicating that the native enzyme may be oligomeric or exist as a complex. A search of the Swissprot data base for similar proteins produced surprising results: PCP (8Tan F. Morris P.W. Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16631-16638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bore significant amino acid sequence homology to QPP, whereas CD26/DPPIV did not. The sequence of QPP also bears similarity to the limited sequence available of porcine DPPII (15Huang K. Takagaki M. Kani K. Ohkubo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that there is significant protein homology between human QPP and three C. elegans proteins. Such conservation may imply an important role for this gene family. Alignment of QPP and PCP revealed a striking degree of sequence conservation around the active-site residues of PCP (Fig. 5). Serine-type peptidases catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds through a charge relay system. This catalytic mechanism is dependent on three active-site amino acid residues, serine, histidine, and aspartic acid. These residues are scattered throughout the primary structure of the protein but are brought into close proximity in the properly folded enzyme, forming the active site. Identification of the positions of these amino acids either experimentally or by comparison of the sequences of homologous enzymes is useful for the classification of the serine proteases into families, which are further grouped into clans. The members of a clan are groups of families thought to have common ancestry (16Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), preferably identified by similarities in tertiary structure. However, the tertiary structure of most enzymes is unknown; therefore, the order of the catalytic residues in the sequence is commonly used. The catalytic residues in the sequences of QPP and PCP are ordered serine, aspartic acid, and histidine. This arrangement and the homology of QPP and PCP (42% amino acid identity over their entire open reading frame) place QPP in the serine-type peptidase clan SC, family S28, with PCP. Recently, DPPII was assigned to this family, based on its amino-terminal sequence similarity to PCP and specificity for prolyl bonds (17Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, QPP and DPPII may be closely related despite certain differences in physical properties. In terms of substrate specificity, QPP resembles CD26/DPPIV and DPPII. QPP and CD26/DPPIV, however, have dissimilar cDNA structures and no significant amino acid homology. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of QPP and CD26/DPPIV activity revealed differences in their inhibitor profiles, indicating differences in the catalytic sites of the two proteases. Before obtaining the QPP cDNA, we had assumed that QPP and CD26/DPPIV had evolved from a common ancestral gene. Although this is clearly not the case, our results indicate that QPP is related to DPPII and PCP. It is interesting to note that QPP is able to cleave the substrate Ala-Pro-AFC over a broad pH range, from acidic to neutral pH. Typically, enzymes do not exhibit activity over such a wide pH range. There are a few exceptions, however, including cathepsin B, a cysteine protease that catalyzes toxin proteolysis in endosomes, which is active from acidic to neutral pH (18Blum J.S. Fiani M.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22091-22095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results show that QPP may indeed localize to the endosomal and lysosomal compartment and a secretory pathway, 2M. Chiravuri, F. Agarraberes, S. Hurta, K. Yardley, H. Lee, and B. T. Huber, manuscript in preparation. explaining its ability to function over a broad pH range. Further work is being done to explore these and other possibilities. Although QPP is expressed in resting and activated PBMCs as well as Jurkat cells, we have observed that blocking QPP leads to cell death exclusively in resting PBMCs (9Chiravuri M. Schmitz T. Underwood R. Yardley K. Dayal Y. Huber B.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3092-3099PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that QPP has many substrates that are processed in the cell, only some of which are necessary for survival of resting PBMCs. Activated PBMCs and transformed cells are very different from resting cells in both gene expression and cell cycle progression and may not produce the same substrates as resting cells or may not require the products of QPP for survival. Efforts are under way to identify the natural substrates of QPP as well as to elucidate the mechanisms of this cell death pathway. Proteases cleave substrates at little energy cost to the cell and may be important mediators of homeostasis in metabolically inactive quiescent cells. We have recently observed that post-proline aminodipeptidase inhibitors cause apoptosis in quiescent cells and that QPP is a likely target of these inhibitors. A large number of signal molecules have a highly conserved Xaa-Pro motif on the amino terminus, whereas there are relatively few enzyme activities that have the ability to cleave peptide bonds containing proline (1Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The isolation and cloning of QPP will help us understand the role of post-proline cleavage in the regulation of proteins with an amino-terminal Xaa-Pro motif.

https://openalex.org/W2028360008,"A cellular target of adenovirus E1A oncoprotein, p300 is a transcriptional coactivator and a negative regulator of cellular proliferation. A previous study suggests that the p300 family is also involved in cell type-specific transcription in cardiac myocytes. However, nothing is known about which cardiac transcription factor(s) interact with and transactivate through these proteins. The transcription factors GATA-4/5/6 have been implicated as key regulators of cardiogenesis, and they participate in the transcription of many cardiac-specific genes. Here we show that E1A represses the GATA-5-dependent transactivation of a promoter derived from the cardiac-restricted atrial natriuretic factor gene. This repression is correlated with the interaction of E1A with p300, indicating that p300 participates in GATA-5-dependent transactivation. E1A markedly down-regulates endogenous atrial natriuretic factor expression, as well as disrupts the interaction between p300 and GATA-5. A small fragment of p300 containing the carboxyl-terminal cysteine/histidine-rich domain, sufficient to interact with GATA-5, prevents transcriptional activation by GATA-5 as a dominant-negative mutant. Consistent with its role as a coactivator, p300 markedly potentiates GATA-5-activated transcription. These results implicate p300 as an important component of myocardial cell differentiation and provide an insight into the relationship between mechanisms that mediate cell type-specific transcription and cell cycle regulation during cardiogenesis.

The differentiated status of these cells is maintained by the expression of muscle-specific genes, the formation of sarcomeres, and rhythmic contractions (reviewed in Ref. 1Litvin J. Montgomery M. Gonzalez-Sanchez A. Bisaha J.G. Bader D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to skeletal myogenesis, a subset of differentiated cardiac myocytes continues to undergo cell division (2Goldstein M.A. Claycomb W.C. Schwartz A. Science. 1974; 183: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, during late gestation, increasing proportions of these cells arrest irreversibly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (3Claycomb W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3229-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rumyantsev P.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1977; 51: 187-273Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, adult cardiac myocytes no longer have the ability to proliferate, and further growth is limited to hypertrophy, i.e. an increase in cell volume but not in number. As such, the identification of the signaling pathways that mediate cardiac myocyte differentiation is critical to the ultimate elucidation of the molecular basis of cardiac muscle hypertrophy and failure. Clues regarding cellular proteins that regulate aspects of cardiac muscle differentiation have been provided by the effects of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein in these cells. When E1A is expressed in already differentiated cardiac muscle cells, it stimulates cellular DNA synthesis and represses muscle-specific gene expression (5Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J.

E1A interacts with at least two classes of cellular factors, namely, the p300 and Rb1 families (reviewed in Ref. 8Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As for the Rb pathway, adenovirus E1A targets the “pocket” domain of Rb and its relatives p107 and p130/Rb2, thereby perturbing normal cellular interaction with the transcription factor E2F/DP. Nevertheless, studies with E1A mutants indicate that interference with the p300 pathway is sufficient to stimulate DNA synthesis and repress muscle-specific gene expression in cardiac myocytes (5Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J.

These experiments suggest that p300 proteins are involved in maintaining both cell type-specific gene expression and cell cycle arrest in cardiac myocytes. p300 proteins are classified as the transcriptional coactivator that communicates between transactivators binding on enhancer DNA and the basal transcriptional complex formed on the promoter near the transcription initiation site (9Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. Decaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). This communication is required for transcriptional activation by the transactivators. Consistent with this view, the p300 family of transcriptional coactivators has been noted to modulate many examples of enhancer-mediated transcription (9Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M.

The members of this family, which, thus far, include p300 and the cAMP-response element binding protein binding protein (CBP), interact directly with components of the basal transcriptional apparatus (e.g. TFIIB and TATA box-binding protein (11Kwok R.P.S.

A p300 protein forms a specific complex with p53, providing a mechanism by which p300 modulates the checkpoint function in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (29Lill N.L. Grassman S.R. Ginsberg D.

In skeletal muscle, p300/CBP are transcriptional adaptors for MyoD and MEF-2, and these interactions are required for myogenesis (18Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition to their possible “bridging function,” p300 proteins possess intrinsic histone acetyl transferase activity (31Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar, 32Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), which is hypothesized to promote a locally “open” and transcriptionally active chromatin configuration. Given the potential role played by p300 protein(s) in cardiac-specific transcription as coactivator(s), the question arises as to which transcription factor(s) interact with and transactivate through these proteins in cardiac myocytes. Because E1A can repress the transcription of many cardiac genes (5Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

The following evidence suggests the importance of GATA-4/5/6, a subclass of zinc finger GATA transcription factors, in cardiogenesis. First, the expression of GATA-4/5/6 is restricted to the heart and gut (33Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell.

Second, this subclass of GATA factors specifically binds the consensus motif conserved among many cardiac-specific promoters, where they function as positive regulators (34Grepin C. Dagnino L.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Despite these data supporting critical roles of GATA factors in cardiogenesis, the ectopic expression of GATA-4 is not sufficient to initiate cardiac differentiation, suggesting that co-factors are required (37Jiang Y.M.

These findings prompted us to investigate whether p300 and GATA-4/5/6 interact with each other and regulate a subset of cardiac muscle-specific genes. As a cardiac-specific promoter, we used a promoter derived from the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, which is expressed very early in embryonic development at the stage when cells are committed to the cardiac phenotype. Throughout embryonic and fetal development, ANF expression characterizes both atrial and ventricular but not skeletal or smooth muscle cells, suggesting that the ANF gene provides a good model system to identify cardiac determinant factors. We present data showing that p300 and GATA-5 cooperate in activating the cardiac-restricted ANF promoter and that these proteins physically interact in vivo. This molecular interaction provides further insights into the relationship between mechanisms that mediate cell type-specific transcription and cell cycle regulation during cardiogenesis. The plasmid constructs pANFluc and pβ-actinluc consist of the firefly luciferase (luc) cDNA driven by 3412 of rat ANF or 433 bp of avian cytoplasmic β-actin promoter sequences (7Hasegawa K.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal (−123/118) GATA element in the rat ANF promoter was performed by amplifying a part of ANF promoter sequences with polymerase chain reaction (p131mutGATA-ANFluc). Wild type ANF promoter with correspondent length was also generated by polymerase chain reaction (p131wtANFluc). pRSVCAT and pRSVluc contain the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and the luc gene driven by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat sequences, respectively (7Hasegawa K.

Anti-GATA-5 antibody for supershift experiment was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS7 cells transfected with 2 μg of pcDNAG5 and 10 μg of either pCMVwtp300 or pCMV1514–1922p300. One mg of the extracts was immunoprecipitated using an anti-mouse GATA-5 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat serum in low stringency buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 16 h at 4 °C and incubated with protein G (Sigma) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1 mmdithiothreitol), heated to 95 °C for 2 min, electrophoresed by an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4%), transferred to an Immobilon membranes, and reacted with monoclonal antibodies against human p300 (a mixture of RW128, RW105, and RW109, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), which was subsequently detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove PA).

After a 2-h incubation with DNA-LipofectAMINE complex, the cells were washed twice with serum-free media and further incubated for 48 h.

To determine whether a forced expression of GATA-4/5/6 can transactivate the cardiac-restricted ANF promoter via the GATA sites in nonmuscle cells, we performed transient transfection experiments using NIH3T3 cells, which do not express GATA-4/5/6. We co-transfected a luc expression vector driven by the 3412-bp ANF promoter with a eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding one of GATA-4/5/6 or β-galactosidase as a control. The transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfected pRSVCAT activity. As shown in Fig.1 A, the expression of GATA-5 resulted in a marked (14-fold) activation of the 3412-bp ANF promoter, whereas the expression of GATA-4 or GATA-6 resulted in moderate activation (4.8- and 6.7-fold, respectively). In contrast, none of GATA-4/5/6 activated a constitutively active β-actin promoter (less than 2-fold). Moreover, co-transfection experiments employing the ANF promoter containing the proximal GATA site mutation, which ablates the binding of GATA-5 as shown below (Fig.2 A), illustrated that the mutation significantly attenuated transactivation of the 131-bp ANF promoter mediated by GATA-4 and -5 but not GATA-6 (Fig. 1). These data demonstrate that GATA-5 and, to a lesser extent, GATA-4 transactivate the cardiac-restricted ANF promoter through the proximal GATA site.Figure 2Analysis of interactions between the ANF GATA site and GATA-5.

Association ofmi with other proteins is a critical step in the regulation of mi-mediated transcriptional activation. We found protein kinase C-interacting protein 1 (PKCI) specifically associated withmi in yeast two-hybrid screening. Immunoprecipitation ofmi from quiescent rat basophilic leukemic cells or mouse melanocytes resulted in the specific co-immunoprecipitation of PKCI. This association was significantly reduced on engagement of the surface FcεRI of mast cells or engagement of the Kit receptor on melanocytes. Hence, cell activation caused disengagement of mi from PKCI. Microphthalmia was previously shown to activate the mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP-6) promoter. Cotransfection of miwith PKCI in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts containing an mMCP-6 promoter-luciferase reporter demonstrated an up to 94% inhibition ofmi-mediated transcriptional activation. PKCI by itself, although localized in the cytosol and nucleus of the cells, has no known physiological function and did not demonstrate transcriptional activity. Its ability to suppres mi transcriptional activity in the transient transfected fibroblast system suggests that it can function in vivo as a negative regulator ofmi-induced transcriptional activation.

Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation of mi expression plays a significant role in the decreased pigmentation observed in melanoma. We recently investigated the expression of mi in mast cells (9Nechushtan H. Zhang Z.-C. Razin E. Blood. 1997; 89: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found that mi plays a crucial role in cell proliferation.mi binds E-box-type enhancer elements (5Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, like many other transcription factors, mi's activity is probably determined through its interactions with other proteins. It was observed that mi may heterodimerize with the related family members TFEB, TFEC, TFE3 (10Carr C.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Beckman H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 12Zhao G.Q. Zhao Q.

Blood. 1997; 89: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present work, we have identified other mi-interacting proteins, using a construct containing the mi bHLH-Zip domains as bait in yeast two-hybrid library screening. We identified one high affinity interacting protein as protein kinase C-interacting protein 1 (PKCI). This protein is a ubiquitous member of the histidine triad (HIT) protein family that is denoted by a conserved HIT sequence motif (13Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This HIT family of proteins is highly conserved in nature, but the physiologic biological activity has not been identified for any of its members, although an in vitro study revealed that PKCI enzymatically hydrolyzes adenosine polyphosphates (13Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).In the present study, we present clear evidence of a function for PKCI as a repressor of mi-induced transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mi and PKCI interact in cell lysates and that this interaction is negatively regulated by cell surface receptor engagement. Thus, this study supports the idea thatmi transcriptional activity is up-regulated in response to cell surface receptor engagement by dissociation from PKCI.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated here that the interaction of PKCI withmi was found to inhibit the transcriptional activity ofmi. Thus, PKCI may serve as a negative regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation.Sequence alignment of PKCI family members ranging from mycoplasma to plants to humans reveal that this family of proteins is extremely well conserved throughout nature (17Robinson K. Aitken A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although PKCI was originally identified as an in vitro inhibitor of the conventional protein kinase C isoforms (18McDonald J.R. Walsh M.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), subsequent studies revealed that it is unlikely that this protein is a potent in vivo inhibitor of protein kinase C (16Klein M.G. Yao Y. Slosberg E.D. Lima C.D. Doki Y. Weinstein B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 244: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Studies using x-ray crystallography and in vitro enzyme assays have elucidated the structural and functional aspects of PKCI, suggesting a possible nucleotidyl hydrolase or transferase activity (13Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo function of PKCI is not known with certainty. Our above mentioned findings of this study along with the nuclear localization of PKCI and miserve to promote the possibility that the inhibitory effects of PKCI might be mediated through sequestration of mi or through PKCI-mediated changes in the mi-binding target DNA.Indirect evidence in support of the idea of mi as a key player in c-Kit-mediated signaling has been reported by Dubreilet al. (19Dubreil P. Forrrester L. Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Fujita J. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study it was shown that the G-CSF receptor could overcome a deficiency of Kit receptor in c-Kit-deficient mast cells, thus allowing these cells to proliferate in response to G-CSF. However, mast cells developed in culture frommi/mi mice, did not proliferate when G-CSF receptor was engaged. Therefore, mi probably acts downstream of c-Kit in growth factor-mediated signaling leading to mast cell proliferation. Thus, it would seem that mi plays a pluripotent role in mast cell activation both as a regulator of c-Kit gene expression and as an essential component in the Kit receptor-mediated signaling.Our present findings suggest a possible mechanism for regulation of cellular proliferation and development by sequestration ofmi from complexing with other transcription elements required for gene activation. This may be a more general mechanism, which may regulate mi association with other proteins such as TFE3, a bHLH-Zip transcription factor related to mi (11Beckman H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), which was previously shown to interact with mi and whose association with mi confirmed in our yeast two hybrid screening. The complexing of these two transcription factors has also been shown to play an important role in osteoclast function and possibly in age-related osteoclast homeostasis (15Weilbaecher K.N. Hershey C.L. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Hemesath T.J. Tashjian A.H. Fisher D.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).The expression of mMCP-6 is highly restricted to mast cells (20Reynolds D.S. Stevens R.L. Lane W.S. Carr M.H. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3230-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and even fibroblasts in normal tissues do not express this protease (21Stevens R.L.

For example, during a helminth infection, mast cells that reside in the jejunal epithelium fail to express mMCP-6, whereas mast cells in the peritoneal cavity, skin, and heart express this tryptase (23Friend D.S Ghildyal N.

Caulfield J.P. Woodbury R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3871-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Lutzelschwab C. Pejler G. Aveskogh M. Hellman L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), does not express substantial amounts of rat homolog of mMCP-6 (rMCP-6, 25). Therefore, it is possible that the expression of substantial amounts of PKCI in these cells may account for their failure to express significant levels of rMCP-6. mMCP-6 induces the selective extravasation of neutrophils into tissues (26Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar) by a mechanism as of yet undefined. Because mMCP-6 is potent, selective, and long-lived, multiple control mechanisms must exist to ensure that its expression is tightly regulated. This tight regulation is essential because mi is also expressed in cells other mast cells (1Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Based on our results, it now appears that one such mechanism is for PKCI to inhibit mi activity.PKCI, however, represents a novel type of molecule that associates withmi, as it does not have transcriptional activity. Its nuclear localization and its role in suppression of mitranscriptional activity indicate its physiological role as a co-repressor of mi. As it is a ubiquitously expressed protein, it may serve a similar role in regulating cell proliferation by interacting with cell-specific transcription factors. The observation that activation of mast cells and melanocytes causes a marked decrease in the association of PKCI with mi suggests that PKCI functions as a transcriptional repressor that associates withmi and prevents mi recruitment and/or activation of target genes until the appropriate stimuli is encountered. Hence, it is likely that mi participates in the coordination of expression of multiple genes by formation of specific complexes. These complexes are likely formed when mi dissociates from PKCI and is thus available to bind other transcription factors like TFE3 and USF2 that may provide both cellular and gene specificity. Microphthalmia (mi)1 is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) type (1Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutations at the mi locus were shown to cause the mouse microphthalmia phenotype (2Hughes M.J. Lingrel J.B Krakowsky J.M. Anderson K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20687-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is now known to contain more than 10 allelic variations (3Moore K.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and is typified by a decrease in mast cell number, deafness, a defect in osteoclasts, small unpigmented eyes and skin, and a major depletion of inner ear melanocytes (3Moore K.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In humans, mutation in this gene causes Wardenburg syndrome type II (4Tachibana M. Takeda K. Nobukuni Y. Urabe K. Long J.E. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Miki T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Northern blot of mRNA from different tissues and cell types showed that mi mRNA is present only in a limited number of tissues and cell types, those being heart, uterus, melanocytes, and mast cells (4Tachibana M. Takeda K. Nobukuni Y. Urabe K. Long J.E. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Miki T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It was reported that mi regulates the expression of mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP-6) (5Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse c-Kit (6Jippo T. Ushio H. Hirota S. Mizuno H. Yamatodani A. Nomura S. Matsuda H. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1994; 84: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Isozaki K. Tsujimura T. Nomura S. Morii E. Koshimizu U. Nishimune Y. Kitamura Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 827-838PubMed Google Scholar) and that mi is involved in the expression of genes involved in pigmentation such as tyrosinase (albino locus), tyrosinase-related protein, and the pink-eyed Pmel 17 (silver) (8Bentley N.J. Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation of mi expression plays a significant role in the decreased pigmentation observed in melanoma. We recently investigated the expression of mi in mast cells (9Nechushtan H. Zhang Z.-C. Razin E. Blood. 1997; 89: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found that mi plays a crucial role in cell proliferation. mi binds E-box-type enhancer elements (5Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, like many other transcription factors, mi's activity is probably determined through its interactions with other proteins. It was observed that mi may heterodimerize with the related family members TFEB, TFEC, TFE3 (10Carr C.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Beckman H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 12Zhao G.Q. Zhao Q. Zhou X. Mattei M.G. De Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4505-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and USF2 (9Nechushtan H. Zhang Z.-C. Razin E. Blood. 1997; 89: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have identified other mi-interacting proteins, using a construct containing the mi bHLH-Zip domains as bait in yeast two-hybrid library screening. We identified one high affinity interacting protein as protein kinase C-interacting protein 1 (PKCI). This protein is a ubiquitous member of the histidine triad (HIT) protein family that is denoted by a conserved HIT sequence motif (13Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This HIT family of proteins is highly conserved in nature, but the physiologic biological activity has not been identified for any of its members, although an in vitro study revealed that PKCI enzymatically hydrolyzes adenosine polyphosphates (13Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present clear evidence of a function for PKCI as a repressor of mi-induced transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mi and PKCI interact in cell lysates and that this interaction is negatively regulated by cell surface receptor engagement. Thus, this study supports the idea thatmi transcriptional activity is up-regulated in response to cell surface receptor engagement by dissociation from PKCI. DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated here that the interaction of PKCI withmi was found to inhibit the transcriptional activity ofmi. Thus, PKCI may serve as a negative regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation.Sequence alignment of PKCI family members ranging from mycoplasma to plants to humans reveal that this family of proteins is extremely well conserved throughout nature (17Robinson K. Aitken A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although PKCI was originally identified as an in vitro inhibitor of the conventional protein kinase C isoforms (18McDonald J.R. Walsh M.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), subsequent studies revealed that it is unlikely that this protein is a potent in vivo inhibitor of protein kinase C (16Klein M.G. Yao Y. Slosberg E.D. Lima C.D. Doki Y. Weinstein B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 244: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Studies using x-ray crystallography and in vitro enzyme assays have elucidated the structural and functional aspects of PKCI, suggesting a possible nucleotidyl hydrolase or transferase activity (13Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo function of PKCI is not known with certainty. Our above mentioned findings of this study along with the nuclear localization of PKCI and miserve to promote the possibility that the inhibitory effects of PKCI might be mediated through sequestration of mi or through PKCI-mediated changes in the mi-binding target DNA.Indirect evidence in support of the idea of mi as a key player in c-Kit-mediated signaling has been reported by Dubreilet al. (19Dubreil P. Forrrester L. Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Fujita J. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study it was shown that the G-CSF receptor could overcome a deficiency of Kit receptor in c-Kit-deficient mast cells, thus allowing these cells to proliferate in response to G-CSF. However, mast cells developed in culture frommi/mi mice, did not proliferate when G-CSF receptor was engaged. Therefore, mi probably acts downstream of c-Kit in growth factor-mediated signaling leading to mast cell proliferation. Thus, it would seem that mi plays a pluripotent role in mast cell activation both as a regulator of c-Kit gene expression and as an essential component in the Kit receptor-mediated signaling.Our present findings suggest a possible mechanism for regulation of cellular proliferation and development by sequestration ofmi from complexing with other transcription elements required for gene activation. This may be a more general mechanism, which may regulate mi association with other proteins such as TFE3, a bHLH-Zip transcription factor related to mi (11Beckman H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), which was previously shown to interact with mi and whose association with mi confirmed in our yeast two hybrid screening. The complexing of these two transcription factors has also been shown to play an important role in osteoclast function and possibly in age-related osteoclast homeostasis (15Weilbaecher K.N. Hershey C.L. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Hemesath T.J. Tashjian A.H. Fisher D.E. J. Exp.

Serafin W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3230-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and even fibroblasts in normal tissues do not express this protease (21Stevens R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2028110119,"Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is a coactivator which mediates transcriptional activation by interconnecting the general transcription factor TATA element-binding protein and gene-specific activators such as the <i>Drosophila</i>nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 or the yeast basic leucine zipper protein GCN4. The human homolog of MBF1 (hMBF1) has been identified but its function, especially in transcription, remains unclear. Here we report the cDNA cloning and functional analysis of hMBF1. Two isoforms, which we term hMBF1α and hMBF1β, have been identified. hMBF1α mRNA was detected in a number of tissues, whereas hMBF1β exhibited tissue-specific expression. Both isoforms bound to TBP and Ad4BP/SF-1, a mammalian counterpart of FTZ-F1, and mediated Ad4BP/SF-1-dependent transcriptional activation. While hMBF1 was detected in the cytoplasm by immunostaining, coexpression of the nuclear protein Ad4BP/SF-1 with hMBF1 induced accumulation of hMBF1 in the nucleus, suggesting that hMBF1 is localized in the nucleus through its binding to Ad4BP/SF-1. hMBF1 also bound to ATF1, a member of the basic leucine zipper protein family, and mediated its activity as a transcriptional activator. These data establish that the coactivator MBF1 is functionally conserved in eukaryotes."

BAG-1 is a cofactor that binds to the ATPase domain of hsp70/hsc70 and that modulates its chaperone activity. Inasmuch as BAG-1 has been found in association with several members of the steroid receptor family, we have examined the effect of BAG-1 on GR folding and GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. BAG-1 was present in reticulocyte lysate at a BAG-1:hsp70/hsc70 molar ratio of ∼0.03, and its elimination by immunoadsorption did not affect GR folding and GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. At low BAG-1:hsp70/hsc70 ratios, BAG-1 promoted the release of Hop from the hsp90-based chaperone system without inhibiting GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. However, at molar ratios approaching stoichiometry with hsp70, BAG-1 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of GR folding to the steroid-binding form with corresponding inhibition of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly by the minimal five-protein chaperone system. Also, there was decreased steroid-binding activity in cells that were transiently or stably transfected with BAG-1. These observations suggest that, at physiological concentrations, BAG-1 modulates assembly by promoting Hop release from the assembly complex; but, at concentrations closer to those in transfected cells and some transformed cell lines, hsp70 is continuously bound by BAG-1, and heterocomplex assembly is blocked.

Hop (60-kDa hsp organizer protein), hsp40 and p23, participate in the ATP/Mg2+-dependent and K+-dependent assembly process (for review of heterocomplex assembly, see Refs. 10Toft D.O.

Hip and BAG-1 (Bcl-2-associated gene product-1) are co-chaperones of hsp70 that are potential participants in or regulators of this multiprotein hsp90-based chaperone system. BAG-1 is an hsp70-binding protein that associates with the ATPase domain of the molecular chaperone with a K D of ∼1–10 nm (12Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). BAG-1 was originally cloned from a mouse library as a Bcl-2-binding protein and shown to have anti-apoptotic activity (13Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Subsequently, BAG-1 was shown to form complexes with some signaling proteins, including receptors for hepatocyte growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (14Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf-1 (15Wang H.-G. Takayama S.

An isoform of the human BAG-1 protein called RAP46 (46-kDareceptor-associated protein; BAG-1M) was cloned and shown to bind to members of the nuclear receptor family, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (17Zeiner M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) to interact with hsp70 suggests an explanation for their association with the various signaling proteins. It is now clear that there is a conserved family of BAG-1-related proteins (12Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and three forms of BAG-1 itself exist as a result of alternative initiation of translation within a common mRNA (21Yang X. Chernenko G. Hao Y. Ding Z. Pater M.M. Pater A. Tang S.-C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The originally identified BAG-1 protein is the shortest, migrating at ∼32 kDa. Human ∼46-kDa RAP46 is the same as BAG-1M, and we will refer to it as BAG-1M in this work. A form migrating at ∼58 kDa is called BAG-1L (22Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The effect of BAG-1 on steroid receptor function appears to depend upon the isoform that is expressed. For example, BAG-1M (RAP46) was found to be a negative regulator of GR activity (23Kullmann M. Schneikert J. Moll J. Heck S. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Cato A.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14620-14625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas BAG-1L, but not BAG-1 or BAG-1M, forms complexes with the androgen receptor and enhances androgen receptor-mediated transactivation of a reporter gene (22Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). hsp70 is a protein chaperone possessing an amino-terminal domain that binds the nucleotides ADP and ATP and a carboxyl-terminal domain that binds peptide, with the binding of ADP versus ATP being coupled to its peptide-binding activity (for review, see Ref. 24Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). hsp70 possesses weak ATPase activity and an intrinsic ADP-ATP exchange activity (25Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). BAG-1, BAG-1M, and BAG-1L have been reported to bind to the hsp70 ATPase domain (19Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), acting much like bacterial GrpE in the DnaK chaperone cycle (Ref. 29Pierpaoli E. Sandmeier E. Schonfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6643-6649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; for review of BAG-1 regulation of hsp70, see Ref. 30Hohfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike GrpE, which enhances the folding activity of DnaK, BAG-1 forms a ternary complex with hsp70 and a non-native substrate, uncoupling the ATP-dependent release of the hsp70-associated substrate (31Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because hsp70 is absolutely required for formation of heterocomplexes between the GR and hsp90 and for changing the folding state of the GR hormone-binding domain to form the high affinity steroid-binding conformation (32Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have asked in this work how BAG-1 affects GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and GR folding by the multiprotein hsp90-based chaperone system. BAG-1 itself was the dominant BAG-1 isoform in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, where it was present at a low concentration with a BAG-1:hsp70 molar ratio of ∼0.03. Elimination of BAG-1 from lysate had little or no effect on its ability to assemble GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and to generate steroid-binding activity. Addition of low concentrations of purified recombinant BAG-1 to a five-protein minimal assembly system consisting of purified hsp90, hsp70, Hop, YDJ-1, and p23 promoted release of Hop from assembly complexes without inhibiting GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. At concentrations approaching stoichiometry with hsp70, however, BAG-1 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of GR folding to the steroid-binding form, with corresponding inhibition of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. Overexpression of BAG-1 resulted in decreased glucocorticoid-binding activity. Thus, at the low levels that exist in reticulocyte lysate, BAG-1 appears to modify heterocomplex assembly by promoting Hop release from the hsp90-based chaperone system; but at higher levels that may be closer to those achieved in transfected cells and some types of transformed cells (27Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar), it has the potential to regulate GR folding in a negative manner. [6,7-3H]Triamcinolone acetonide (42.8 Ci/mmol) and125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Hybridoma cells producing the FiGR monoclonal IgG against the GR were generously provided by Dr. Jack Bodwell (Dartmouth Medical School). The baculovirus for mouse GR was kindly provided by Dr. Edwin Sanchez (Medical College of Ohio). Construction of the pcDNA3-hu-BAG-1 plasmid for expression of human BAG-1 has been described previously (33Takayama S. Kochel K. Irie S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Sato T. Druck T. Huebner K. Reed J.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as was the GM-701 human fibroblast cell line stably expressing FLAG-BAG-1 (26Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C.

The cDNA for expressing GFP-GR, described previously (34Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Harrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol.

Monkey kidney COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When cells were confluent, they were rinsed three times with serum-free DMEM and incubated for an additional hour in DMEM with 5% serum. Cells were then transfected with 2 μg/ml GFP-GR cDNA and 3 μg/ml pcDNA3 vector or pcDNA3-hu-BAG-1. The DNAs were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 6 μl of TransFast reagent/μg of DNA in 200 μl of DMEM, and the mixtures were added to the cell cultures. After 1 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced by 10% charcoal-stripped bovine calf serum for an additional 24 h of incubation. The cells were washed three times with Earle's balanced saline and suspended in 1 volume of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 20 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture/3 ml of buffer. Cells were ruptured by Dounce homogenization and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g to prepare the cytosol. GM-701 human fibroblasts (the parental line and a subline stably transfected with FLAG-tagged murine BAG-1) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When cells were ∼80% confluent, they were harvested, and the cytosol was prepared as described for COS-7 cells. Sf9 cells were grown in SFM900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). Cultures were infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0. Cultures were supplemented with 1% glucose at infection and 24 h post-infection as described by Srinivasan et al. (35Srinivasan G. Post J.F.M. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed in Hanks' balanced saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm molybdate, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots of Sf9 cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 7 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 300 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate or various mixtures of purified proteins as noted, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immune pellet for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 1 ml of 0.5m KCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer, followed by a second wash with 1 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. For immunoadsorption of Hop, 300-μl aliquots of reticulocyte lysate were immunoadsorbed to 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose prebound with DS14F5 antibody against Hop or with nonimmune mouse IgG. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and immune pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer (TEG buffer with 20 mm sodium molybdate). FiGR immune pellets containing GRs stripped of hsp90 were incubated with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, with combinations of lysate DE52 fractions A–C, or with various mixtures of proteins (20 μg of purified hsp90, 20 μg of purified hsp70, 2 μl of lysate from bacteria expressing Hop, 6 μg of purified p23, and 2 μl of lysate from bacteria expressing YDJ-1) and adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.35) containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm MgOAc, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer and assayed for steroid-binding capacity and, in some experiments, for receptor-associated proteins. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight in 50 μl 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmmolybdate plus 50 nm [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound per FiGR immune pellet prepared from 50 μl of Sf9 cytosol. For assay of steroid binding in the cytosol from COS-7 cells or GM-701 cells, 100 μl of cytosol was incubated overnight with 50 nm [3H]triamcinolone acetonide (±1000-fold excess of radioinert dexamethasone). Bound steroid was separated from free steroid by adding 1.5 volumes of dextran-coated charcoal suspension (1% (w/v) charcoal and 0.2% (w/v) dextran in 10 mm Hepes and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.35). The radioactivity in the supernatant was assayed, and the specific binding was normalized for the cytosol protein concentration. To assay the GR and associated proteins or Hop and associated proteins, immune pellets were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 2 μg/ml BuGR2 for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 1 μg/ml N27F3-4 for hsp70, 0.1% DS14F5 mouse ascites for Hop, and 0.5% anti-hsp40 antibody or 0.1% JJ3 mouse ascites for p23. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate125I- or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. hsp90 and hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (32Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human p23 (36Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from 10 ml of bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52 as described (8Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Fractions containing p23 were identified by immunoblotting, pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration to ∼1.5 ml, dialyzed against HKD buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. The bacterial expression of YDJ-1 has been described previously (37Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this work, bacterial lysate expressing YDJ-1 or Hop was added to the heterocomplex assembly system without purification of the recombinant proteins. Murine BAG-1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified by adsorption to glutathione-agarose, followed by thrombin cleavage and ion-exchange and Superdex-75 gel filtration chromatography as described previously (20Stuart J.K. Myszka D.G. Joss L. Mitchell R.S. McDonald S.M. Xie Z. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22506-22514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purified BAG-1 (3 mg/ml) was stored at −70 °C in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. After unfreezing, the solution was cleared of insoluble protein by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g. Hop is a 60-kDa protein that interacts with hsp70 and hsp90 (39Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) via separate binding sites (40Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acting as an adaptor protein (41Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) in the hsp90-based chaperone machinery. We have shown previously that immunoadsorption of Hop from reticulocyte lysate is accompanied by co-immunoadsorption of hsp90, hsp70, and hsp40 as an hsp90·Hop·hsp70·hsp40 heterocomplex (8Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This complex immunoadsorbed from reticulocyte lysate or prepared from purified proteins is able to convert the GR to the high affinity steroid-binding conformation (6Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Formation of a heterocomplex between hsp90 and the hormone-binding domain of the GR is required to produce the proper folding state for steroid binding (42Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4992-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, we investigated whether either BAG-1 or Hip is present in the multiprotein GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly machine that we call a foldosome (44Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, immunoadsorption of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with a monoclonal antibody against Hop yielded co-adsorption of hsp90 and hsp70 as well as the hsp70-associated proteins hsp40, Hip, and BAG-1. hsp70 possesses separate non-overlapping binding sites for Hop, hsp40, and Hip (18Demand J. Luders J. Hohfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, Hip and BAG-1 compete for binding to the ATPase domain of hsp70 (28Hohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and they must exist in separate hsp90·Hop·hsp70·hsp40 heterocomplexes. It should be noted that, to visualize Hip and BAG-1, the autoradiograms for these proteins required a much longer exposure time than for the major proteins in Fig. 1. Thus, it seems that only a fraction of the multiprotein hsp heterocomplexes isolated from reticulocyte lysate contain either Hip or BAG-1. In Fig.2, the rabbit reticulocyte lysate proteins were fractionated by chromatography on DE52. The dominant BAG-1 isoform is ∼32-kDa BAG-1, which eluted early in the salt gradient with another slower migrating immunoreactive species that we refer to as BAG-1M (Fig. 2 A). A trace amount of an immunoreactive species migrated as expected for BAG-1L, but eluted at higher salt concentrations, indicating that it is more acidic than BAG-1 and BAG-1M. Reticulocyte lysate contained very little BAG-1 relative to both Hip and the established components of the hsp90-based chaperone system: hsp90, hsp70, Hop, hsp40, and p23 (Fig.2 A). The reticulocyte lysate proteins were combined into three DE52 subfractions designated A, B, and C (Fig.2 B). In Fig. 3 A, immune pellets containing GRs stripped of hsp90 were incubated with DE52 subfractions A–C in various combinations. Maximum generation of steroid-binding activity required all three fractions of reticulocyte lysate. Because of a low level of cross-contamination of components between fractions, some steroid-binding activity was generated when just two subfractions were present (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 B, substitution of fraction B with purified hsp90 and of fraction C with purified p23 yielded a reconstituted system that was entirely dependent upon the presence of lysate fraction A. To determine if BAG-1 in reticulocyte lysate was affecting (either negatively or positively) GR folding, BAG-1 was eliminated from lysate fraction A by immunoadsorption. As shown in Fig.4 A, adsorption of fraction A with protein A-Sepharose prebound with anti-BAG-1 antibody (I) eliminated BAG-1 from fraction A. Substitution of fraction A with either nonimmune IgG-adsorbed (A(NI)) or anti-BAG-1 antibody-adsorbed (A(I)) fraction A yielded comparable levels of GR steroid-binding activity and resulted in assembly of similar GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes (Fig. 4 B). Thus, we suggest that, at the levels that are present in reticulocyte lysate, BAG-1 does not affect the ability of the GR to be folded to the steroid-binding state by the hsp90-based chaperone system. To determine the effect of BAG-1 on GR folding at concentrations approaching stoichiometry with hsp70, we performed experiments in which stripped GR immune pellets were incubated with a minimal folding system (8Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

(1980)Biochemistry 19, 526–531), the ε subunit, an endogenous inhibitor of bacterial F1-ATPase, has long been thought not to inhibit activity of the holo-enzyme, F0F1-ATPase. However, we report here that the ε subunit is exerting inhibition in F0F1-ATPase. We prepared a C-terminal half-truncated ε subunit (εΔC) of the thermophilicBacillus PS3 F0F1-ATPase and reconstituted F1- and F0F1-ATPase containing εΔC. Compared with F1- and F0F1-ATPase containing intact ε, those containing εΔC showed uninhibited activity; severalfold higher rate of ATP hydrolysis at low ATP concentration and the start of ATP hydrolysis without an initial lag at high ATP concentration. The F0F1-ATPase containing εΔC was capable of ATP-driven H+ pumping. The time-course of pumping at low ATP concentration was faster than that by the F0F1-ATPase containing intact ε. Thus, the comparison with noninhibitory εΔC mutant shed light on the inhibitory role of the intact ε subunit in F0F1-ATPase. Since the report by Sternweis and Smith (Sternweis, P. C., and Smith, J.

F1-ATPase is the water-soluble portion of F0F1-ATPase and contains a catalytic core for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The F1-ATPase consists of five kinds of subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ε1. The catalytic sites of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis are located mainly on the β subunits, and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites are located mainly on the α subunits (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The α3β3γ subcomplex of F1-ATPase is regarded as a minimum stable complex, which has similar catalytic features to F1-ATPase (6Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Three catalytic sites of F1-ATPase exhibit strong negative cooperativity in ATP binding and positive cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis. Recent studies have revealed that the γ and ε subunits rotate relative to an α3β3 cylinder during the catalysis (9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase, a specific ATPase inhibitor protein and its cooperative proteins have been known (16Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Hashimoto T. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This system is thought to be responsible for maintenance of either electrochemical potential of protons or ATP level by preventing ATP synthesis/hydrolysis of F0F1-ATPase when the activity of respiratory system is decreased (18Hashimoto T. Shiroiwa M. Ichikawa N. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. Seikagaku. 1996; 68 (Japanese): 775Google Scholar). In chloroplast F0F1-ATPase, it has been proposed that the activity is controlled both by the electrochemical potential of protons, which turns on or off the inhibitory effect of ε subunit, and by the cellular redox state, which affects formation and cleavage of an inhibitory disulfide bond within γ subunit (for review, see Ref. 19Ort D.R. Oxborough K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 269-291Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar).However, such a regulatory system has yet been unknown in the bacterial F0F1-ATPase. Although the ε subunit is known to be an endogenous ATPase inhibitor of F1-ATPase (20Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Laget P.P. Smith J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it was reported that the inhibition by ε subunit of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase was no longer observed when F1-ATPase associated with F0 to form the holoenzyme, F0F1-ATPase (22Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of the inhibition by ε subunit has been thought to be the prevention of wasting ATP in the cell by free F1-ATPase which are transiently generated during the course of assembly to the holoenzyme (22Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Previously, we reported inhibitory effect of ε subunit on the ATPase activity of F1-ATPase from thermophilic BacillusPS3 (TF1)1 (23Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Pronounced inhibition was observed at low ATP concentrations, and the slow activation occurred as catalytic cycles repeated. At high ATP concentrations, activation proceeded fast, and the effect of ε subunit was seen only as a short initial lag (23Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unlike the case ofE. coli F1-ATPase where the ε subunit tends to dissociate from F1-ATPase during multiple turnovers of ATPase reaction, the ε subunit of TF1 remains associated with the α3β3γ portion during the course of activation (23Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consequently, TF1 has two different forms, inhibited form and uninhibited form, without changing the subunit composition.Here we investigated the inhibition of F0F1-ATPase from thermophilicBacillus PS3 (TF0F1) by the ε subunit. In the previous experiments on TF1, we compared the activities of the reconstituted subunit complexes of TF1 with and without ε subunit (23Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To compare the properties of TF0F1 by the same approach, one has to prepare TF0F1, which lacks ε subunit. However, F1-ATPase deficient in ε subunit is unable to associate with F0 (24Yoshida M. Okamoto H. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 936-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, we have used an N-terminal fragment of ε subunit (εΔC, see Fig. 1). The ε subunit is composed of two domains; N-terminal β strand sandwich domain and C-terminal helix-loop-helix hairpin domain (25Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M.

It was reported that the truncated ε subunit deficient in C-terminal helical domain lost the inhibitory effect in E. coli (28Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16423-16429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and chloroplast F1-ATPases (30Cruz J.A. Harfe B. Radkowski C.A. Dann M.S. McCarty R.E.

Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects, Vol. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1998: 1711-1714Google Scholar). Moreover, F1-ATPase containing the truncated ε could bind to F0 and supported cell growth on oxidative phosphorylation (28Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Xiong H. Zhang D. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16423-16429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that TF1containing εΔC (TF1(εΔC)) would show uninhibited ATPase activity but still retain the ability to mediate the binding of TF1 to TF0. This turned out to be the case and comparison of the properties of TF0F1 containing intact ε (TF0F1(ε)) with that containing εΔC(TF0F1(εΔC)) provided evidence that the ε subunit in TF0F1 is exerting inhibitory effect on ATP hydrolysis and ATP driven H+-pumping activities.

Cells of the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle (MTAL)1 are of special interest, since they are the major contributor to the generation of the renal cortico-papillary osmotic gradient allowing urinary concentration in terrestrial animals. The first adaptive process occurring in response to extracellular hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage is a regulatory cell volume increase (RVI). The RVI results from the stimulation of ion transporters which increase the intracellular ion content within minutes and partially restore the cellular volume from the initial cell shrinkage (2Parker J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1191-C1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sun A.M. Saltzberg S.N. Kikeri D. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A second adaptive mechanism, in mammalian cells, is the induction of genes encoding proteins involved in the accumulation of intracellular “compatible osmolytes” within hours and days. These osmoprotective proteins are either enzymes,i.e. aldose reductase generating sorbitol from glucose, or organic osmolytes transporters, i.e. myo-inositol, taurine, glycerophosphocholine, and betaine (4Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways mediating these adaptive mechanisms, especially the role of MAP kinases, are still incompletely understood.Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades are important intracellular signal-transduction pathways activated in response to changes in osmolality. MAP kinases are serine/threonine kinases activated via a cascade of kinases involving a sequential phosphorylation of two kinases (MAP kinase kinase kinase and MAP kinase kinase), which activates a MAP kinase via a dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues (5Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the MAP kinase family contains three major subgroups responding to distinct extracellular stimuli: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK) principally activated by growth factors, integrin-matrix interaction, and hormones or neurotransmitters with serpentine receptors (6Wu J.

Neither the respective role of intracellular hypertonicityversus cell shrinkage in the activation of MAP kinases by extracellular hyperosmolality nor the relationship between the MAP kinase activation and the regulatory cell volume increase have been investigated. We have undertaken this study: 1) to examine the effects of different solutes on the activation of MAP kinases in MTAL cells by hypertonicity, and 2) to analyze the relationship between MAP kinase activation and cell volume variations.DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that cell shrinkage induced by extracellular hypertonicity activates MAP kinases in rat MTAL.

Our study, taken with the results of Watts et al. (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar), extends this finding to native rat MTAL cells, which are exposed to extracellular osmolarities from 300 to 600 mosmol/liter under water diuresis and antidiuresis, respectively (1Knepper M.A. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 532-570Google Scholar). In the present study, the level of phosphorylation of MAP kinases was taken as an index of their activation since only phosphorylated MAP kinases are active (5Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar) and the increase in phosphorylation parallels the activity of MAP kinases in MTAL cells (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, taken together with a recent study showing that water restriction activates MAP kinases in the rat renal inner medulla (33Wojtaszek P.A. Heasley L.E. Berl T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), support the physiological relevance of the activation of MAP kinases by extracellular hypertonicity.The major role of MTAL cell shrinkage in the hypertonicity-induced MAP kinases activation is supported by the following observations. 1) Hypertonic urea, which did not alter cellular volume, did not activate MAP kinases; 2) hypertonic sucrose, which induced a larger decrease in cellular volume, was a more powerful activator of ERK and p38 kinases than hypertonic NaCl; 3) cellular volume was inversely correlated with the activation level of ERK and p38 kinases; 4) increased intracellular osmolarity without alteration in cellular volume did not activate ERK and p38 kinase; and 5) cell shrinkage under isotonic conditions was associated with an activation of ERK and p38 kinase, which was reversible upon return to the initial cell volume. These results strongly suggest that cell shrinkage activates the MAP kinases in rat MTAL cells. A role for cell volume variations in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways has already been demonstrated in human polymorphonuclear cells (34Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Since hyperosmolarity activates MAP kinases through changes in cellular volume, the hypothesis that components of the cytoskeleton may be the primary sensor should be considered. Moreover, extracellular hypertonicity drives water movement outside the cells leading to an increase in cytoplasmic concentration of macromolecules, which could play the role of volume sensor (2Parker J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1191-C1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, aggregation of growth factor and cytokine receptors leading to their ligand-independent activation could participate to the activation of MAP kinases by hypertonicity via membrane-based sensors (18Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Indeed, hypertonicity increases tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in human polymorphonuclear cells (34Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells (35Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the activation of ERK and p38 kinase is tyrosine kinase-dependent in rat MTAL cells (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas both MTAL and IMCD cells are exposed to extracellular hypertonicity, comparison of the activation pattern of MAP kinases reveals a cellular specificity. In agreement with Watts et al. (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar), our study shows that in MTAL cells, JNK is not activated by hypertonic NaCl, in contrast with the marked activation of JNK by hypertonic NaCl in mIMCD cells (VC52, VC18). Nevertheless, hypertonic sucrose stimulated JNK by about 2-fold in MTAL cells. However, JNK activation was considerably lower than stimulation of both ERK (about 10-fold) and p38 kinase (about 4-fold). This higher activation level of MAP kinases might be related to the more pronounced cell shrinkage induced by hypertonic sucrose as compared with hypertonic NaCl. In MTAL cells, cell shrinkage may induce a sequential activation of MAP kinases pathway, with a more sensitive response of ERK and p38 kinase pathways.The RVI is an essential mechanism of cellular protection against osmotic stress. After the initial cell shrinkage, MTAL cells exhibit a RVI response that involves the activation of ion transporters (3Sun A.M. Saltzberg S.N. Kikeri D. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This process drives sodium influx coupled to secondary water movements into the cells and allows the partial recovery of the initial cell volume (2Parker J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1191-C1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results confirm that MTAL cells undergo RVI after an hypertonic challenge (3Sun A.M. Saltzberg S.N. Kikeri D. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with NaCl and sucrose, and show that p38 kinase activation is required for this process, while ERK pathway does not appear to play a role. Whether p38 kinase activates ion transporters through direct phosphorylation or involves intermediate steps remains to be determined. Among them, one can postulate a role for a p38-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling (22Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have shown that, in rat MTAL cells, hypertonic extracellular medium activates ERK and p38 kinase and in a lesser extent JNK. This activation was not the direct consequence of an increase in intracellular osmolarity, but was mediated by cell shrinkage. In addition, this study demonstrates that activation of p38 kinase is essential in the regulatory cell volume increase process, a cell protection mechanism against the physiological hyperosmolarity of the rat kidney medulla. During diuresis and antidiuresis, the kidney medulla is exposed to large fluctuations of interstitial osmolarity (1Knepper M.A. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 532-570Google Scholar), which challenge cell volume constancy.

The RVI results from the stimulation of ion transporters which increase the intracellular ion content within minutes and partially restore the cellular volume from the initial cell shrinkage (2Parker J.C.

Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar), including MDCK cells (26Itoh T. Yamauchi A. Miyai A. Yokoyama K. Kamada T. Ueda N.

Our study, taken with the results of Watts et al. (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar), extends this finding to native rat MTAL cells, which are exposed to extracellular osmolarities from 300 to 600 mosmol/liter under water diuresis and antidiuresis, respectively (1Knepper M.A. Rector Jr., F.C. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 532-570Google Scholar). In the present study, the level of phosphorylation of MAP kinases was taken as an index of their activation since only phosphorylated MAP kinases are active (5Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar) and the increase in phosphorylation parallels the activity of MAP kinases in MTAL cells (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, taken together with a recent study showing that water restriction activates MAP kinases in the rat renal inner medulla (33Wojtaszek P.A. Heasley L.E. Berl T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), support the physiological relevance of the activation of MAP kinases by extracellular hypertonicity.The major role of MTAL cell shrinkage in the hypertonicity-induced MAP kinases activation is supported by the following observations. 1) Hypertonic urea, which did not alter cellular volume, did not activate MAP kinases; 2) hypertonic sucrose, which induced a larger decrease in cellular volume, was a more powerful activator of ERK and p38 kinases than hypertonic NaCl; 3) cellular volume was inversely correlated with the activation level of ERK and p38 kinases; 4) increased intracellular osmolarity without alteration in cellular volume did not activate ERK and p38 kinase; and 5) cell shrinkage under isotonic conditions was associated with an activation of ERK and p38 kinase, which was reversible upon return to the initial cell volume. These results strongly suggest that cell shrinkage activates the MAP kinases in rat MTAL cells. A role for cell volume variations in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways has already been demonstrated in human polymorphonuclear cells (34Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Since hyperosmolarity activates MAP kinases through changes in cellular volume, the hypothesis that components of the cytoskeleton may be the primary sensor should be considered. Moreover, extracellular hypertonicity drives water movement outside the cells leading to an increase in cytoplasmic concentration of macromolecules, which could play the role of volume sensor (2Parker J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1191-C1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, aggregation of growth factor and cytokine receptors leading to their ligand-independent activation could participate to the activation of MAP kinases by hypertonicity via membrane-based sensors (18Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Indeed, hypertonicity increases tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in human polymorphonuclear cells (34Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells (35Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the activation of ERK and p38 kinase is tyrosine kinase-dependent in rat MTAL cells (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas both MTAL and IMCD cells are exposed to extracellular hypertonicity, comparison of the activation pattern of MAP kinases reveals a cellular specificity. In agreement with Watts et al. (30Watts B.A.I. Di Mari J.F. Davis R.J. Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F478-F486PubMed Google Scholar), our study shows that in MTAL cells, JNK is not activated by hypertonic NaCl, in contrast with the marked activation of JNK by hypertonic NaCl in mIMCD cells (VC52, VC18). Nevertheless, hypertonic sucrose stimulated JNK by about 2-fold in MTAL cells. However, JNK activation was considerably lower than stimulation of both ERK (about 10-fold) and p38 kinase (about 4-fold). This higher activation level of MAP kinases might be related to the more pronounced cell shrinkage induced by hypertonic sucrose as compared with hypertonic NaCl. In MTAL cells, cell shrinkage may induce a sequential activation of MAP kinases pathway, with a more sensitive response of ERK and p38 kinase pathways.The RVI is an essential mechanism of cellular protection against osmotic stress. After the initial cell shrinkage, MTAL cells exhibit a RVI response that involves the activation of ion transporters (3Sun A.M. Saltzberg S.N. Kikeri D. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This process drives sodium influx coupled to secondary water movements into the cells and allows the partial recovery of the initial cell volume (2Parker J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1191-C1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results confirm that MTAL cells undergo RVI after an hypertonic challenge (3Sun A.M. Saltzberg S.N. Kikeri D. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with NaCl and sucrose, and show that p38 kinase activation is required for this process, while ERK pathway does not appear to play a role. Whether p38 kinase activates ion transporters through direct phosphorylation or involves intermediate steps remains to be determined. Among them, one can postulate a role for a p38-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling (22Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have shown that, in rat MTAL cells, hypertonic extracellular medium activates ERK and p38 kinase and in a lesser extent JNK. This activation was not the direct consequence of an increase in intracellular osmolarity, but was mediated by cell shrinkage. In addition, this study demonstrates that activation of p38 kinase is essential in the regulatory cell volume increase process, a cell protection mechanism against the physiological hyperosmolarity of the rat kidney medulla. The present study shows that cell shrinkage induced by extracellular hypertonicity activates MAP kinases in rat MTAL.

Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in<i>Cdx-2/3</i> exhibit multiple malfunctions including tail abnormalities, stunted growth, a homeotic shift in vertebrae, and the development of multiple intestinal adenomatous polyps, indicating that<i>Cdx-2/3</i> is haplo-insufficient. <i>In vitro</i> studies have identified more than a half-dozen downstream target genes expressed in pancreatic and intestinal cells for this transcription factor. We have examined the transcriptional properties of the mouse<i>Cdx</i>-2/3 promoter. This promoter could be autoregulated in pancreatic and intestinal cells that express endogenous Cdx-2/3. In contrast, Cdx-2/3 transfection represses the <i>Cdx-2/3</i>promoter in fibroblasts, which do not express endogenous Cdx-2/3. Since Cdx-2/3 activates proglucagon gene promoter in both pancreatic and intestinal cells and in fibroblasts, we suggest that some, yet to be identified, cell type-specific components are required for activating selected target gene promoters of Cdx-2/3, including the Cdx-2/3 promoter itself. Cdx-2/3 binds to the TATA box and another AT-rich motif, designated as DBS, within an evolutionarily conserved proximal element of the <i>Cdx-2/3</i> promoter. The DBS motif is critical for the autoregulation, whereas the TATA box may act as an attenuating element for the autoregulatory loop. Finally, overexpression of Cdx-2/3 in a pancreatic cell line activated the expression of the endogenous Cdx-2/3. Taken together, our results indicate that the dose-dependent phenotype of Cdx-2/3 expression on its downstream targets <i>in vivo</i> could be regulated initially via a transcriptional network involving cell type-specific autoregulation of the <i>Cdx-2/3</i> promoter."

Importantly, we identify the presence of serine 133-phosphorylated CREB in the nucleus of F9-differentiated cells but not in the nucleus of F9 EC cells.

A subset of this superfamily are the TGF-βs, which consists of at least five genes encoding distinct proteins in vertebrates (referred to as TGF-β1–5). TGF-β1–3 are the mammalian homologs and share approximately 70% amino acid sequence homology. Despite this high sequence homology, each isoform has a distinct temporal and spatial pattern of development (4Pelton R.W. Nomura S. Moses H.L. Hogan B.L.M.

Interestingly, TGF-β1, -β2 and -β3 null mice show distinctive developmental defects with little to no phenotypic overlap. TGF-β1 knockout mice die shortly after birth due to multifocal inflammatory disease (9Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Keir A.B. Pawlowski S. Deibold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D.

Furthermore, striking differences exist between the 5′-flanking regions of each gene, suggesting that differences in isoform expression may be mediated through tissue-specific gene transcription (12Kim S.J.

Important for the modulation of the TGF-β2 gene during the differentiation of F9 EC cells is the presence of a critical positive regulatory region in the TGF-β2 gene promoter, localized between −77 and +63, where +1 is the transcription start site (23Kelly D.

Additionally, in electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays, ATF-1 and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) bind to the CRE/ATF motif, and the upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (USF1 and -2) bind to the E-box element (26Burt D.W.

Previous studies have demonstrated that these transcription factors are present in nuclear extracts prepared from both F9 EC cells and F9-differentiated cells and can bind to their respective cis-regulatory elements in vitro (25Scholtz B.

Expression of a dominant-negative USF expression plasmid reduces the expression of a TGF-β2 promoter/reporter construct by approximately 80% (25Scholtz B. Kingsley-Kallesen M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32375-32380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the USF proteins are important for the proper expression of the TGF-β2 gene, but prior to this study, the exact function of the E-box and CRE/ATF binding proteins in the case of the TGF-β2 promoter in F9-differentiated cells had not been elucidated. USF1 and USF2 are basic/helix loop helix/leucine zipper proteins that are ubiquitously expressed and bind as dimers to a canonical CACGTG core DNA sequence (termed an E-box) (29Gregor P.D.

Although the biological functions of the USF proteins are poorly understood, they are involved in the regulation of a wide variety of genes including α1(I) collagen (33Rippe R.A. Umezawa A.

Falaschi A. Giacca M.. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2765-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings have identified USF1 as a phosphoprotein (36Galibert M.D. Boucontet L. Goding C.R. Meo T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6176-6183PubMed Google Scholar), which may contribute to its regulation. Additionally, USF1 proteins do not appear to interact with nucleosomes that are associated with histone H1 (37Juan L.J. Utley R.T. Adams C.C. Vettese-Dadey M. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6031-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but they preferentially bind nucleosomal DNA highly acetylated on histone H4 (38Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R.

The CRE/ATF transcription factors, ATF-1 and CREB have been well characterized, exhibit approximately 70% homology overall, and are over 90% homologous within their DNA binding, dimerization, and kinase-inducible domains (39Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The kinase-inducible domain contains multiple phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated by a number of different kinases (reviewed in Refs. 39Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys.

The primary purpose of this study was to understand how the TGF-β2 gene is regulated in F9-differentiated cells. First, we demonstrate that ATF-1, CREB, USF1, and USF2 function in vivo to up-regulate TGF-β2 promoter activity. We also demonstrate that the activity of CREB and ATF-1 is enhanced by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and calmodulin kinase IV (CaMKIV). Additionally, since phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 and ATF-1 at serine 63 by these kinases has been shown previously to recruit p300 and CBP (41Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17957-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of p300 and CBP to modulate TGF-β2 promoter activity. We determined that p300 and CBP augment TGF-β2 promoter activity when expressed in conjunction with CREB or ATF-1 and the catalytic subunit of PKA or constitutively active CaMKIV. This activation is dependent on an intact CRE/ATF site but not an intact E-box. We also show that the serine 133-phosphorylated form of CREB is present in the nucleus of F9-differentiated cells but not in the nucleus of F9 EC cells. Importantly, this phosphorylated form is present in whole cell extracts of both the parental and differentiated cells, suggesting that nuclear accumulation of serine 133-phosphorylated CREB is regulated during differentiation of F9 EC cells. In view of the findings presented here, we propose that accumulation of serine 133-phosphorylated CREB in the nucleus of F9-differentiated cells allows for recruitment of p300/CBP to the TGF-β2 promoter, and this is likely to play an important role in the activation of the TGF-β2 gene when EC cells differentiate. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium HG-21 and Ham's F-12 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). All-trans-RA was purchased from Acros Organics, a division of Fisher. All other chemicals, including protease and phosphatase inhibitors, gelatin, and dibutyryl cAMP were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. F9 EC cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and grown on tissue culture dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin. When cellular extracts were prepared, differentiation of F9 EC cells was induced by a 4-day treatment with 5 μm RA. When differentiated cells were used in transfection studies, they were treated for 3 days with 5 μm RA before transfection. Stock cultures and all experimental cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. F9-differentiated cells were transfected in monolayer by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as modified by our laboratory (23Kelly D. O'Reilly M. Rizzino A. Dev.

In each experiment, 2 μg of either pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pCH111 (obtained from Dr. Ron Hines, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI) was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. pCH110 contains the β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the SV40 promoter and enhancer. The pCH111 plasmid contains the β-galactosidase reporter under the control of the RSV long terminal repeat. After an overnight incubation with the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (1:1) and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (and 5 μm RA for F9-differentiated cells).

https://openalex.org/W2000755750,"The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans encodes six putative chloride channels (CeCLC-1 through CeCLC-6) that represent all three known branches of the mammalian CLC gene family. Using promoter fragments to drive the expression of the green fluorescent protein, CeCLC-2, -3, and -4 expression was studied in transgenic C. elegans. CeCLC-4 was specifically expressed in the large H-shaped excretory cell, where it was co-expressed with CeCLC-3, which is also expressed in other cells, including neurons, muscles, and epithelial cells. Also, CeCLC-2 was expressed in several cells of the nervous system, intestinal cells, and vulval muscle cells. Similar to mammalian CLC proteins, only two nematode CLC channels elicited detectable plasma membrane currents inXenopus oocytes. CeCLC-3 currents were inwardly rectifying and were activated by positive prepulses. Its complex gating behavior can be explained by two gates, at least one of which depends on extracellular anions. In this respect it resembles some mammalian chloride channels with which it also shares a preference of chloride over iodide. C. elegans thus provides new opportunities to understand common mechanisms underlying structure and function in CLC channels and will allow for a genetic dissection of chloride channels in this simple model organism.

CeCLC-4 was specifically expressed in the large H-shaped excretory cell, where it was co-expressed with CeCLC-3, which is also expressed in other cells, including neurons, muscles, and epithelial cells. Also, CeCLC-2 was expressed in several cells of the nervous system, intestinal cells, and vulval muscle cells. Similar to mammalian CLC proteins, only two nematode CLC channels elicited detectable plasma membrane currents inXenopus oocytes. CeCLC-3 currents were inwardly rectifying and were activated by positive prepulses. Its complex gating behavior can be explained by two gates, at least one of which depends on extracellular anions. In this respect it resembles some mammalian chloride channels with which it also shares a preference of chloride over iodide. C. elegans thus provides new opportunities to understand common mechanisms underlying structure and function in CLC channels and will allow for a genetic dissection of chloride channels in this simple model organism. green fluorescent protein (2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid) CLC chloride channels, first identified by the cloning of ClC-0 from the electric fish Torpedo (1Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. Schwarz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), are present in organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, and plants to animals (for review, see Ref. 2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In humans, nine different CLC genes are known. The functions of CLC Cl− channels probably include the stabilization of membrane potential, transepithelial transport, cell volume regulation, and endocytosis (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Several CLC channels may have a role in intracellular organelles rather than in the plasma membrane. The physiological roles of CLC channels are best illustrated by human inherited diseases: mutations in the muscle Cl− channel ClC-1 lead to myotonia (3Steinmeyer K. Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M.

CLC proteins have 10 or 12 transmembrane domains and are structurally distinct from other Cl− channels such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine receptors. At least some CLC channels may have a “double-barreled” structure with two identical pores (8Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 10Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), although this is still controversial for ClC-1 (10Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Gating of CLC channels often depends on anions, which may serve as the gating charge (12Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13Chen T.Y. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Several studies have addressed structure-function issues of the approximately six CLC channels that can be functionally expressed. To have a broader basis for understanding the structure and function of this important channel class, an access to additional CLC channels would be desirable. In a search for new CLC channels we turned to the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans. This worm offers unique possibilities as a model animal. For instance, it is relatively easy to obtain transgenic C. elegans that can be used to obtain expression patterns of genes (14Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5484) Google Scholar). As a first step toward elucidating the properties and roles of CLC channels in C. elegans, we have cloned five CLC cDNAs from that nematode and have investigated the expression pattern of three of these. The biophysical analysis of CeCLC-3, which is the only channel that gave reasonably large currents upon heterologous expression, gives interesting new insights into CLC Cl− channel gating. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) homology searches of GenBank with the ClC-6 sequence yielded the C. elegans expressed sequence tag yk16b8 (accession number D35033) and several genomic cosmid clones (C33B4 (accession number Z48367), T27D12 (accession number Z70037), F32A5 (accession number U20864), E04F6 (accession number U28943), T06F4 (accession number U41551), R02E4 (accession number U40957), C07H4 (accession number Z68334), T24H10 (accession number Z54216)), and R07B7 (accession number 275955). T27D12 contains the genomic region of expressed sequence tag yk16b8, which we named Ceclc-1. C33B4 contains Ceclc-2, and the sequences of F32A5 and E04F6 span the Ceclc-3 genomic region. Ceclc-4 is encoded on cosmids T06F4 and R02E4, whereas C07H4 and T24H10 containCeclc-5 and R07B7 Ceclc-6. cDNA clones were obtained either from a mixed stage C. elegans cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on mRNA from mixed stage C. elegans cultures (strain Bristol N2). 3 μg of poly(A)+-selected RNA were reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to match exons predicted by the program Genefinder. 5′- and 3′ ends were isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. Full-length cDNAs were assembled by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the expression vector PTLN (15Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The sequences of all five cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing and deposited in the GenBank-EMBL data base, accession numbers. AF173170–AF173174. Genomic clones used for transgenic animals were isolated from a genomicC. elegans library in λFix II phages (Stratagene). AllC. elegans strains (Bristol N2 and pha-1 (e2123)) were cultured on nematode growth medium plates seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 previously grown in 3XD liquid cultures. Animals were grown at 18° C (Bristol N2) and 15 °C (pha-1 (e2123)). For GFP1 expression constructs, the following genomic sequences and vectors were used (sequence upstream of the transcription start indicated in parentheses): ceclc-2::GFP1, 3.8-kbSapI-BbsI fragment, cloned into pPD 95.79 (courtesy of A. Fire, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Baltimore, MD; Ref. 14Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5484) Google Scholar) (3 kb); ceclc-2::GFP2, 8.5-kbMluI-PflMI cloned into pPD 95.75 (4 kb); the fusion protein lacks the last 23 amino acids of CeCLC-2 and carries the GFP portion instead; ceclc-3::GFP, 10.5-kbNotI-BstXI fragment from a λ clone cloned into pPD 95.77 (7 kb); and ceclc-4::GFP, 7.2-kbNotI-ClaI fragment from a λ clone cloned into pPD 95.75 (6.9 kb). NotI restriction sites were derived from the λFix II vector. The fragments were blunted and cloned into theSmaI site of the GFP expression vectors. Transgenic animals were generated as described (16Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of GFP expression plasmid and selection marker (pBX, containing a wild-type copy of the pha-1 gene; Ref. 17Granato M. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1762-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) were co-injected into gonads of pha-1 (e2123) mutants. The animals were transferred to 25 °C ∼5 h after injection. Nematode strains and pBX plasmid were gifts from Ralf Schnabel. Micrographs were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) on live animals. After linearization, capped cRNAs were synthesized from CeCLC expression constructs in PTLN (15Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and ∼50 nl (∼0.5 μg/μl) were injected into Xenopusoocytes prepared by manual defolliculation or collagenase treatment. After 1–7 days at 17 °C in (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6), oocytes were examined by two-electrode voltage clamping using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Currents were usually recorded in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 2.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at room temperature. For anion replacement experiments, 80 mm NaCl was replaced by equimolar amounts of NaI, NaBr, NaNO3, or Na-glutamate. When pH was changed, Tris, pH 8.5, or MES, pH <7, was used instead of HEPES. For fast solution exchanges (see Fig. 5) a special perfusion chamber and computer-controlled electromagnetic valves were used. We isolated cDNAs encoding five different CLC proteins from C. elegans, which we named CeCLC-1 through CeCLC-5 according to the terminology of the CLC channels (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of CeCLC-1, -2, and -5 contain SL1 leader sequences at their 5′ ends. This is because of trans-splicing of their mRNAs, a common phenomenon in C. elegans (18Krause M. Hirsh D. Cell. 1987; 49: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The completion of theC. elegans Genome Project (19C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar) revealed that there is just one additional CLC gene in its genome, bringing the total number to six. Sequence comparison and hydropathy analysis revealed that all predicted CLC proteins from C. elegans share domains D1 through D12 with their mammalian counterparts (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These domains may span the lipid bilayer 10 or 12 times (20Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Like mammalian CLC proteins, CeCLC proteins have two CBS domains (21Ponting C.P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in their cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. These domains of unknown function are also present in the single yeast CLC but are absent from some bacterial CLC proteins (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Based on homology, the nine known mammalian CLCs can be grouped into three different branches. We aligned the predicted proteins CeCLC-1 through CeCLC-6 with the mammalian proteins and constructed a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1 A). It reveals that every mammalian branch is also represented in C. elegans. The most extended mammalian branch has also the largest number of members in C. elegans (CeCLC-1 through CeCLC-4), but these are not direct orthologs of the mammalian channels. The two other branches are represented by just a single CLC in C. elegans. We analyzed the genomic organization of the C. elegansCLC genes by aligning the cDNAs to the corresponding genomic sequence (19C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar). The CLC genes of C. elegans contain mostly short introns (Fig. 1 B). Their number is less than in mammalian CLCs, which have ∼20 introns (22Lorenz C. Meyer-Kleine C. Steinmeyer K. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Chu S. Zeitlin P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Exon-intron boundaries are not conserved between the C. elegans CLC genes. The ceclc-5 gene is shorter and contains less introns than the other CLC genes. This apparent evolutionary divergence is also reflected in its weak homology to the other CeCLC proteins. In localization studies we focused on those channels (CeCLC-2 and CeCLC-3) that yielded currents (see below) and later extended our analysis to CeCLC-4. We generated transgenic animals expressing GFP under the control of respective promoter elements. The appropriate constructs were co-injected with a plasmid containing the pha-1 gene into the gonads of the pha-1 (e2123) strain (17Granato M. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1762-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This allows for a selection of transgenic animals by shifting the incubation temperature from 15 to 25 °C. When GFP expression was driven by the upstream sequence of CeCLC-2, fluorescence was found in some parts of the neuromuscular system (Fig. 2, A–C). The nervous system was labeled to a large extent. Labeling was strong in the nerve ring (nr), and included the dorsal and ventral nerve cord (dnc and vnc), and tail neurons (tn). The vulval muscles (vm) and the pharyngeal intestinal valve cells (piv), which connect the pharynx to the intestine, were also stained. The same structures were labeled, albeit weaker, when a CeCLC-2-GFP fusion protein was expressed from a slightly longer upstream region (data not shown). A CeCLC-3 promoter element labeled different cell types (Fig. 2,G–I). There was GFP fluorescence in the large, H-shaped, excretory cell (ec). The first four epithelial cells of the intestine (ic), the muscles of the defecation system (em), and the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSN), which innervate vulval muscles, were labeled as well. In contrast to CeCLC-2 and -3, a promoter element from CeCLC-4 directed GFP expression only to a single cell, the large, H-shaped, excretory cell (Fig. 2 M). Thus, this cell co-expresses CeCLC-3 and CeCLC-4. Expression patterns were identical in all four larval stages and adults except the vulval muscles and the HSN neurons, which are absent in larvae and are only generated at the last molt of L4 to adult hermaphrodites (data not shown). We expressed CeCLC proteins in Xenopus oocytes and measured currents by two-electrode voltage clamping. Although CeCLC-2 and CeCLC-3 gave currents, we were unable to observe currents with any of the other CeCLC proteins we tested (CeCLC-1, -4, and -5). Currents induced by CeCLC-2 (Fig.3 A) were small and barely above background (Fig. 3 B). They activated slowly upon hyperpolarization and were abolished by a mutation (P422L) analogous to a mutation in ClC-1 (P480L) that causes human myotonia (24Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Pusch M. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and were reduced when extracellular chloride was replaced by iodide (data not shown). The low amplitude of these currents precluded a more detailed investigation. CeCLC-3 gave larger, strongly inwardly rectifying currents, which activated rapidly (τ ∼ 10 ms) upon hyperpolarization (Fig.3 C). This was followed by a slower (τ ∼ 500 ms) decay to stationary values after a maximum at ∼80 ms (Fig. 3,D and E). Similar results were obtained in the HEK293 expression system (data not shown). Steady-state currents displayed strong inward rectification and were slightly smaller when extracellular chloride concentration was reduced (Fig. 3 F). No outward tail currents could be measured at positive voltages after activating hyperpolarizing prepulses (data not shown), indicating that the channel closes very fast at depolarized voltages. The magnitude and the shape of the transient inward current depended strongly on the voltage preceding the hyperpolarization. With prepulses more positive than −30 mV, the transient inward currents increased both with the magnitude and the length of this pulse (Fig.4 A). With prepulses to +30 or +50 mV, this activation did not saturate even with prepulse lengths of 6 s. This indicated a slow gating process activating the channel with depolarization. This activation, however, became only visible when stepping to hyperpolarizing voltages. Because the gating of many CLC Cl− channels depends on anions (12Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13Chen T.Y. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Pusch M. Jordt S.E. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 341-353Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D.S. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 423-435Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we replaced extracellular chloride partially with other anions during the entire pulse protocol (Fig. 4,B and C). Peak currents were nearly unchanged with NO3− but decreased with other anions. This yielded a sequence of Cl− ≥ NO3− > Br− > I− > glutamate with respect to their ability to stimulate inward currents (i.e. outward flow of anions). Similar to other CLC channels (26Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D.S. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 423-435Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 28Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), CeCLC-3 currents are also modulated by pH. Extracellular acidification increased currents at physiological pH values (Fig. 4, D and E). Two known inhibitors of Cl− channels, diphenylamino-2-carbonic acid (1 mm) and niflumic acid (0.5 mm), largely inhibited CeCLC-3 currents (data not shown). Although the experiments of Fig. 4, B andC, demonstrate that extracellular anions modulate CeCLC-3 currents, they do not identify the phase (pre or test pulse) during which they are important. We therefore changed the Cl−concentration during the activating prepulse 0.5 s before applying the hyperpolarizing test pulse (Fig. 5). This ensured that the solution exchange was virtually complete at the beginning of the test pulse. Comparison of traces a and b (or c and d) (Fig.5 A) shows that the peak current at the beginning of the test pulse did not depend on the extracellular Cl−concentration at that time. However, it depended strongly on the presence of Cl− before the test pulse, i.e.during the depolarizing prepulse (e.g. Fig. 5 A, compare traces b and c, where Cl−concentration was high and low, respectively, during the prepulse, but was constant (low) during the test pulse). The kinetics of the current decay and the steady-state current, however, depended on the actual Cl−-concentration (Fig. 5 A, comparetraces a and b; also see Fig.3 F). Because the activation by depolarization is slow, we tested whether the activation by Cl− during an otherwise constant prepulse is equally slow (Fig. 5 B). Indeed, the magnitude of the subsequent hyperpolarization-induced current depended approximately to the same degree on the length of exposure to Cl− as it did on the length of depolarization in the experiment of Fig.4 A. Thus, the activation of CeClC-3 is attributable to a slow process that needs both depolarizing voltages and extracellular chloride. Because some CLC channels form heteromers (15Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), we co-expressed CeCLC-2 and CeCLC-3. The resulting currents could not be distinguished from CeCLC-3 currents, which will dominate macroscopic currents if both channels are formed independently. Because CeCLC-3 and CeCLC-4 co-localize in the excretory H-shaped cell, we also co-expressed their cDNAs even though CeCLC-4 by itself did not yield currents. Again, we found no indication for a functional interaction (data not shown). The C. elegans genome encodes six different CLC channels and 37 ligand-gated chloride channels like γ-aminobutyric acid A and inhibitory glutamate receptors (29Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The number of CLC genes in C. elegans compares favorably with the number of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (six) and to Ca2+ channels (nine) but is much less than that of K+ channels (>60). Also in vertebrates, many more K+ channels than CLC Cl− channels are known. We currently know nine different mammalian CLC channels. Based on homology, they are grouped into three different classes (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These three branches are also represented in the nematode. By contrast, there is only a single CLC gene in S. cerevisiae, and all channels isolated so far from Arabidopsis belong to the third CLC branch (30Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B. Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33632-33638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The presence of all three CLC classes in C. elegans may suggest that they serve different, conserved functions. In analogy to mammalian CLCs, we suspect CeCLC-1 through CeCLC-4 to be plasma membrane channels. Indeed, plasma membrane currents were observed with CeCLC-2 and -3. It has been speculated (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) that channels from the second and third mammalian branch are predominantly expressed in intracellular organelles where they may facilitate their acidification. This was most convincingly shown for ClC-5 (31Günther W. Lüchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Hence, it is tempting to speculate that CeCLC-5 and possibly CeCLC-6 have similar roles. Consistent with diverse functions, we observed highly specific expression patterns for those channels we analyzed in transgenicC. elegans. Expression of both CeCLC-2 and CeCLC-3 was not restricted to a single cell type and not even to a single cell lineage. CeCLC-2 was broadly expressed in the nervous system and in the vulval muscle and pharyngeal intestinal valve cells. CeCLC-3 is expressed in some epithelial cells, in defecation muscles, in serotonergic HSN neurons, and in the large, H-shaped excretory cell. This latter cell also expresses CeClC-4, whose transcription seems to be limited to this single cell. Establishing the functions of CLC channels in C. elegansrequires the knowledge not only of their expression pattern but also of their channel properties. Of the five CeCLC cDNAs tested, only two yielded currents. Similarly, only five of nine mammalian CLC channels yielded reproducible channel activity (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), whereas none of theArabidopsis CLCs gave currents (30Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B. Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33632-33638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the nonexpressible channels reside normally in intracellular membranes. Alternatively, the expression system may be inadequate, or auxiliary subunits might be missing. Any of these reasons could explain our failure to observe currents with CeCLC-1, -4, and -5. CeCLC-2 gave inwardly rectifying currents, which could not be analyzed in detail because they were too small. CeCLC-3, however, showed reasonable expression and very interesting gating characteristics. Its inwardly rectifying currents were slowly activated by prepulses to positive voltages. This is somehow reminiscent of the K+channel HERG (32Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). HERG is activated by depolarization, but it inactivates so fast that virtually no currents are present at positive voltages. When stepping back to negative voltages, the channel returns to the open state, leading to transient inward currents. Similarly we propose two different gates for CeCLC-3, which operate on very different time scales. A slow anion-dependent process activates CeCLC-3 by depolarization. A faster “inactivation,” however, closes the channel quickly at positive voltages such that practically no outward currents can be measured. When stepping back to negative potentials, the channel recovers from inactivation within some 10 ms. The inward peak currents did not depend on the presence of extracellular anions at that time (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that the inactivation process is independent of external anions. At these negative voltages, the channel then partially closes again with comparatively slow kinetics. Also, this slow closure depends on anions, as shown by the faster deactivation when extracellular Cl−concentration was reduced (Fig. 5 A). The presence of two gates and the dependence of gating on extracellular anions are reminiscent of ClC-0, the prototype Torpedochannel. ClC-0 is a double-barreled channel with two identical pores (8Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). One of the two gates (which is present in two “copies”) is fast and opens single pores upon depolarization, whereas the other gate is slow and opens both pores together upon hyperpolarization. The fast depolarization-activated gate depends on extracellular chloride (12Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar,13Chen T.Y. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, the slow depolarization-activated gate of CeCLC-3 may operate by a similar mechanism. In the absence of single-channel data, we do not know whether CeCLC-3 is also a double-barreled channel. The depolarization-activated, Cl− dependent gate of ClC-0 is fast, the depolarization-activated, Cl− dependent gate of CeCLC-3 is slow. The kinetics of the other gate ARE also different: the hyperpolarization-activated gate is slow in ClC-0, whereas it is fast in CeCLC-3. Also between closer related CLC channels these two gates have different properties: the common gate operating on both channels is slow and hyperpolarization activated in ClC-0, whereas it is faster and activated by depolarization in ClC-1 (10Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The strong inward rectification and the fast inactivation precluded a determination of the anion selectivity of CeCLC-3. However, the efficiency with which extracellular anions activated CeCLC-3 fits with the anion selectivity of CLC channels. With the exception of controversial data for ClC-K2 and ClC-3 (2Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), all CLC channels displayed a Cl− > I− selectivity and most often conduct Cl− better than Br−. What might be the physiological importance of the complex gating of CeCLC-3? In nonexcitable cells, the activation by depolarizing voltages seems irrelevant, and only the inwardly rectifying steady-state currents are important. Such an inward rectifier may be involved in transepithelial transport or in the regulation of intracellular Cl− concentration, as suggested for the inward rectifier ClC-2 (33Staley K. Smith R. Schaack J. Wilcox C. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The Cl− and pH dependence may be important for the excretory H-cell and the intestinal cells, which express CeCLC-3. Both cell types are involved in transport processes with their environment. The H-cell has a role in detoxification (34Broeks A. Janssen H.W. Calafat J. Plasterk R.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and seems essential for the osmoregulation of the worm (35Nelson F.K. Riddle D.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 231: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is interesting that the mammalian ClC-2 is activated by cell swelling (27Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, swelling had no effect on CeCLC-3 expressed in oocytes (data not shown). The situation is different in the excitable cells, that express CeCLC-3. C. elegans has no voltage-dependent Na+ channels (29Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and neurons lack action potentials and propagate electrical signals tonically (36Goodman M.B. Hall D.H. Avery L. Lockery S.R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 763-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These neurons have a region of phenomenological high resistance between −90 and −30 mV. In this range small currents (as elicited by synaptic transmission) lead to rather large voltage changes (36Goodman M.B. Hall D.H. Avery L. Lockery S.R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 763-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). CeCLC-3 will not blunt these signals, because it is closed in this range. By contrast, action potentials occur in nematode muscles (37Davis M.W. Somerville D. Lee R.Y. Lockery S. Avery L. Fambrough D.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8408-8418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lee R.Y. Lobel L. Hengartner M. Horvitz H.R. Avery L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6066-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). They depend on Ca2+ channels (38Lee R.Y. Lobel L. Hengartner M. Horvitz H.R. Avery L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6066-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), are much longer (∼150 ms) than in mammals, and reach voltages exceeding +30 mV. This will activate CeCLC-3, especially if action potentials are repetitive. Interestingly, an activation behavior similar to CeCLC-3 (but faster) was described for the “negative spike current” in Ascaris muscle (39Byerly L. Masuda M.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 288: 263-284Google Scholar). These inward K+ currents, which are also activated by positive prepulses, are thought to influence the termination of action potentials both in Ascaris (39Byerly L. Masuda M.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 288: 263-284Google Scholar) and in C. elegans(37Davis M.W. Somerville D. Lee R.Y. Lockery S. Avery L. Fambrough D.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8408-8418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) muscle. Assuming that the Cl− equilibrium potential in C. elegans is close to resting membrane voltage, as supported by the effects of γ-aminobutyric acid (40McIntire S.L. Jorgensen E. Kaplan J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 41Reiner D.J. Thomas J.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6094-6102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CeCLC-3 could have a similar function. However, it is unlikely that it contributes directly to the repolarization, because it is closed at depolarized potentials. Rather, it will increase the membrane conductance at resting and hyperpolarizing voltages, in particular after action potentials. Somewhat similar to HERG (32Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) in the cardiac muscle, it could influence muscle excitability and its rhythmic activity. As with mammalian genes, a disruption of the C. elegans CLC genes will help determine their physiological roles. Although no homologous recombination procedure is established for the nematode, this can be done by transposon insertion or novel RNA-mediated interference approaches (42Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11728) Google Scholar). Our work provides the framework for such experiments in this model organism. In addition, the availability of a novel, expressible CLC Cl− channel with unique biophysical characteristics will advance our understanding of the structure and function of this important channel family.

Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). During development, the intercellular junctional complex, composed of tight junctions, adherens junctions (AJs),1 and desmosomes (2Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar), is repeatedly destroyed and formed. Therefore, the mechanism of regulation of the formation and destruction of the junctional complex has attracted a great deal of interest from cell as well as developmental biologists. AJs are electron microscopically characterized by their electron-dense plasmalemmal undercoats through which actin filaments are densely associated with plasma membranes (3Geiger B. Ginsberg D. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,4Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Curr. Opin.

Vestweber D. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several constituents of AJ undercoats, which may connect E-cadherin to the actin-based cytoskeleton or regulate some AJ functions, have been identified, including α-, β-, and γ-catenins (7Ozawa M.

The molecular mechanism of the formation and destruction of AJs can thus be rephrased as the mechanism responsible for the assembly and disassembly of the multimolecular complexes consisting of E-cadherin and these undercoat-constitutive proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins has been shown to be directly involved in the assembly and disassembly of AJs (13Warren S.L. Nelson W.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the past decade, this fraction has allowed the identification of several AJ-associated proteins such as β-catenin, tenuin, radixin, afadin, and ponsin (8Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Several src family tyrosine kinases (c-src, c-yes, and lyn kinases) were also shown to be concentrated in this fraction as autophosphorylated forms (22Tsukita S. Oishi K. Akiyama T. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As a continuation of this study, here we attempted to identify heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the isolated junctional fraction from the mouse liver. Unexpectedly, an enzyme with protein cross-linking activity, transglutaminase type 1 (TGase1), was identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated form.TGase is a general term for enzymes that catalyze the post-translational cross-linking of proteins by acyl transfer reaction (for reviews see Refs. 23Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 24Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar, 25Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In this reaction, γ-carboxamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues and primary amines of peptide-bound lysine serve as acyl donor and acceptor substrates, respectively, to form either ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds. The resulting cross-linking bonds are covalent, stable, and resistant to proteolysis, thereby increasing the resistance of proteins to chemical, enzymatic, and physical degradation. To date, at least five distinct types of TGases have been identified; four intracellular forms (TGase1–TGase4) and one extracellular form (plasma coagulation factor XIIIa). Among these, TGase2, the so-called “tissue-type” TGase, was first identified in the liver (26Clarke D.D. Mycek M.J. Neidle A. Waelsch H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 79: 338-354Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested to be involved in cell-to-matrix adhesion (27Gentile V. Thomazy V. Piacentini M. Fesus L. Davies P.J. J.

Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), but its physiological relevance is not fully understood. Next, plasma coagulation factor XIIIa was shown to be a TGase (31Loewy A.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. Suppl. 1968; 28: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). TGase3 and TGase4 were identified as “epidermal-type” and “prostate-type” enzymes, respectively, because of their tissue-specific expression patterns (32Kim H.C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.C.

Green H. Cell. 1977; 11: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 35Rice R.H. Green H. J.

TGase1 is directly involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope of terminally differentiated epidermis by cross-linking proteins beneath plasma membranes (38Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Several mutations in the TGase1 gene were reported in some families with lamellar ichthyosis, an autosomal recessive skin disorder, which is evident clinically at birth as a “collodion baby” accompanied with erythroderma (39Huber M. Rettler I. Bernasconi K. Frenk E. Lavrijsen S.P. Ponec M. Bon A. Lautenschlager S. Schorderet D.F. Hohl D. Science. 1995; 267: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). TGase1 has been suggested to be expressed exclusively in the skin epidermis, and its expression and functions in other tissues have not been examined in detail. TGase1-deficient mice were reported to die at an early neonatal stage, but their histological changes in tissues other than the skin epidermis have not been examined in detail (40Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S. Ueda E. Morishima Y. Tabata K. Yasuno H. Hashida M. Iizuka H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Kondoh G. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Identification of TGase1 in the isolated junctional fraction from the liver prompted us to evaluate the intriguing possibility that TGase-dependent cross-linking of proteins plays some important role in the regulation of AJ assembly and disassembly.DISCUSSIONTGase1 was reported to be expressed specifically in keratinocytes, and its cross-linking activity was thought to play a central role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope of terminally differentiated epidermis (38Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S.

A. 1998; 95: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study, however, Northern as well as Western blotting analyses indicated that TGase1 was also expressed in large amounts in tissues containing simple epithelia, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that endogenous TGase1 was mostly colocalized with E-cadherin and concentrated, although this localization was not exclusive, at AJs in simple epithelial cells. These findings prompted us to reexamine the physiological relevance of TGase1.The TGase activity detected using 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine as a substrate was also enriched in the isolated junctional fraction from the liver and co-concentrated with E-cadherin at AJs in cultured simple epithelial cells. However, this pentylamine is not a specific substrate for TGase1. Among the four types of intracellular TGases (types 1–4), only type 2 (TGase2) was reported to be expressed in various types of cells (52Thomazy V. Fesus L. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports (53Piacentini M. Ceru M.P. Dini L. Di Rao M. Piredda L. Thomazy V. Davies P.J. Fesus L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Western blotting with anti-TGase2 mAb (CUB7402; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) revealed that TGase2 was abundant in the cytoplasm of the liver and was not concentrated in the junctional fraction in contrast to TGase1 (data not shown). Furthermore, in cultured simple epithelial cells, TGase2 was not detected by Western blotting or immunofluorescence staining with anti-TGase2 mAb (CUB7402; data not shown). Therefore, the TGase activity detected with 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine in this study was mostly attributed to TGase1, although the possibility cannot be ruled out that as yet unidentified type of TGase gives rise to part of observed activity, and the TGase1 concentrated at E-cadherin-based cell adhesion sites appeared to be active as a transglutaminase within cells. The “membrane-associated TGase activity,” which was previously reported in the liver (54Slife C.W. Dorsett M.D. Bouquett G.T. Register A. Taylor E. Conroy S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), would be the same as the activity described in this study.These findings suggested that the TGase1-mediated covalent cross-linking of proteins is directly involved in the formation and maintenance of intercellular junctions, especially AJs. To date, only the noncovalent protein-protein binding in the junctions has been intensively analyzed. Western blotting of the junctional fraction with anti-TGase1 pAb revealed that TGase1 was concentrated in the junctions not only as a full-length 97-kDa form but also as higher molecular mass forms (see Fig. 3 B). Because TGase itself was known to be cross-linked to various proteins through its own enzymatic activity, in the junctions this “auto-cross-linking” also would produce higher molecular mass forms of TGase1. Furthermore, the numerous biotin-labeled bands shown in Fig. 6 indicated that in the junctions TGase1 used various proteins as substrates. Thus, in the intercellular junctions, especially in AJs, we would expect the presence of highly complicated multimolecular complexes, in which constituents including TGase1 itself were covalently cross-linked through the TGase1 enzymatic activity. Because these complexes would be resistant to extraction even with SDS, it would be difficult to analyze them with conventional biochemical methods, including SDS-PAGE.To understand the physiological functions of TGase1 in simple epithelial cells, several important questions must be answered in future studies. The first important question is how TGase1 is targeted to the intercellular junctions, especially to AJs, in simple epithelial cells. TGase1, but not the other TGases, was reported to be acylated with myristates and/or palmitates at its NH2-terminal cysteine-rich region, and this was thought to be the reason why only the TGase1 was anchored on membranes. However, to be recruited to AJs, other additional mechanisms are required. Furthermore, it should be emphasized here that even in simple epithelial cells TGase1 was not exclusively distributed at AJs. Taking into consideration that TGase1 forms large multimolecular complexes that include TGase1 itself, the mechanism responsible for localization of TGase1 in simple epithelial cells would be rather complicated.The second point to be elucidated is the identities of the major substrates for TGase1 in AJs. As discussed above, in the 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine cross-linking experiments with the isolated junctional fraction, various proteins appeared to be cross-linked by endogenous TGase1 activity. It is technically possible to isolate biotinylated, glutamine-containing proteins from the fraction using avidin-coupled columns and to determine what species of proteins are cross-linked with 5-(biotin-amido)pentylamine. Identification of the substrates of the enzymatic reaction would greatly help us analyze the cellular function of TGase1 in future studies. Third, it is necessary to determine the mechanism of regulation of TGase1 activity. We initially identified TGase1 as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from the junctional fraction of the mouse liver, suggesting that the TGase1 activity is regulated through its tyrosine phosphorylation. Although it was confirmed that some fraction of TGase1 was actually tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured simple epithelial cells by immunoprecipitation (data not shown), the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on the enzymatic activity of TGase1 remained to be elucidated.The results of this study shed light on the possible functions of TGase1 in AJs in simple epithelial cells. TGase1-deficient mice were reported to die within 4–5 h after birth (40Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S. Ueda E. Morishima Y. Tabata K. Yasuno H. Hashida M. Iizuka H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Kondoh G. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It was speculated that mice died of dehydration caused by skin barrier dysfunction, because the widespread expression of TGase1 in tissues other than the skin had not been demonstrated. However, they noticed that TGase1-deficient mice were smaller than controls, and preliminary studies identified some histological changes at least in the lung. Further extensive analyses of the TGase1-deficient mice will lead us to a better understanding of the physiological roles of TGase1 in simple epithelia. Because it is widely thought that the plasmalemmal undercoat structures in AJs are involved in the stabilization and/or up-regulation of cadherin-based cell adhesion, it is reasonable to speculate that TGase1-mediated cross-linking of proteins plays a role in further stabilization and up-regulation of cell-cell adhesion. However, this cross-linking is not necessarily irreversible in vivo. The enzymatic activity that catalyzes the breakdown of γ-glutamylamines to free amines and 5-oxo-proline, i.e. the breakdown of the TGase-mediated covalent bonds, was identified in rabbit tissues such as the kidneys, liver, and intestine (55Fink M.L. Chung S.I. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4564-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, TGase2 and factor XIIIa themselves were reported to possess such hydrolytic activities (56Parameswaran K.N. Cheng X.F. Chen E.C. Velasco P.T. Wilson J.H. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10311-10317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the TGase1-mediated covalent cross-linking is dynamically regulated in simple epithelial cells. Further studies are required to characterize the physiological functions of TGase1 in epithelial cells and to determine whether the TGase1-mediated cross-linking of proteins is one of the important and general mechanisms involved in formation, maintenance, and regulation of the structural integrity of simple epithelial cells, especially at AJs. Cell-cell adhesion is essential for the formation and maintenance of the integrity of animal body as a community of a wide variety of cells (1Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). During development, the intercellular junctional complex, composed of tight junctions, adherens junctions (AJs),1 and desmosomes (2Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar), is repeatedly destroyed and formed. Therefore, the mechanism of regulation of the formation and destruction of the junctional complex has attracted a great deal of interest from cell as well as developmental biologists. AJs are electron microscopically characterized by their electron-dense plasmalemmal undercoats through which actin filaments are densely associated with plasma membranes (3Geiger B. Ginsberg D. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,4Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). E-cadherin (5Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), a transmembrane protein responsible for Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion, is concentrated and functions as a major adhesion molecule at AJs (6Boller K. Vestweber D. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several constituents of AJ undercoats, which may connect E-cadherin to the actin-based cytoskeleton or regulate some AJ functions, have been identified, including α-, β-, and γ-catenins (7Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 8Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S.

Wheelock M.J. Matsuyoshi N. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the formation and destruction of AJs can thus be rephrased as the mechanism responsible for the assembly and disassembly of the multimolecular complexes consisting of E-cadherin and these undercoat-constitutive proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins has been shown to be directly involved in the assembly and disassembly of AJs (13Warren S.L. Nelson W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Takata K. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Behrens J. Vakaet L.

Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We developed a procedure for the isolation of AJs (“junctional fraction”) from the rat liver (17Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the past decade, this fraction has allowed the identification of several AJ-associated proteins such as β-catenin, tenuin, radixin, afadin, and ponsin (8Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 18Tsukita S. Itoh M. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Several src family tyrosine kinases (c-src, c-yes, and lyn kinases) were also shown to be concentrated in this fraction as autophosphorylated forms (22Tsukita S. Oishi K. Akiyama T. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As a continuation of this study, here we attempted to identify heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the isolated junctional fraction from the mouse liver. Unexpectedly, an enzyme with protein cross-linking activity, transglutaminase type 1 (TGase1), was identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated form. TGase is a general term for enzymes that catalyze the post-translational cross-linking of proteins by acyl transfer reaction (for reviews see Refs. 23Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 24Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar, 25Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In this reaction, γ-carboxamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues and primary amines of peptide-bound lysine serve as acyl donor and acceptor substrates, respectively, to form either ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds. The resulting cross-linking bonds are covalent, stable, and resistant to proteolysis, thereby increasing the resistance of proteins to chemical, enzymatic, and physical degradation. To date, at least five distinct types of TGases have been identified; four intracellular forms (TGase1–TGase4) and one extracellular form (plasma coagulation factor XIIIa). Among these, TGase2, the so-called “tissue-type” TGase, was first identified in the liver (26Clarke D.D. Mycek M.J. Neidle A. Waelsch H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 79: 338-354Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested to be involved in cell-to-matrix adhesion (27Gentile V. Thomazy V. Piacentini M. Fesus L. Davies P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis (29Fesus L. Madi A. Balajthy Z. Nemes Z. Szondy Z. Experientia. 1996; 52: 942-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and signal transduction as a GTPase (30Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), but its physiological relevance is not fully understood. Next, plasma coagulation factor XIIIa was shown to be a TGase (31Loewy A.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. Suppl. 1968; 28: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). TGase3 and TGase4 were identified as “epidermal-type” and “prostate-type” enzymes, respectively, because of their tissue-specific expression patterns (32Kim H.C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12660-12667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGase1, the so-called “keratinocyte-type” TGase, was identified and analyzed in epidermal keratinocytes (34Rice R.H. Green H. Cell. 1977; 11: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 35Rice R.H. Green H. J.

A. 1990; 87: 9333-9337Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). TGase1 is directly involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope of terminally differentiated epidermis by cross-linking proteins beneath plasma membranes (38Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Several mutations in the TGase1 gene were reported in some families with lamellar ichthyosis, an autosomal recessive skin disorder, which is evident clinically at birth as a “collodion baby” accompanied with erythroderma (39Huber M. Rettler I. Bernasconi K. Frenk E. Lavrijsen S.P. Ponec M. Bon A. Lautenschlager S. Schorderet D.F. Hohl D. Science. 1995; 267: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). TGase1 has been suggested to be expressed exclusively in the skin epidermis, and its expression and functions in other tissues have not been examined in detail. TGase1-deficient mice were reported to die at an early neonatal stage, but their histological changes in tissues other than the skin epidermis have not been examined in detail (40Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S. Ueda E. Morishima Y. Tabata K. Yasuno H. Hashida M. Iizuka H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Kondoh G. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Identification of TGase1 in the isolated junctional fraction from the liver prompted us to evaluate the intriguing possibility that TGase-dependent cross-linking of proteins plays some important role in the regulation of AJ assembly and disassembly. DISCUSSIONTGase1 was reported to be expressed specifically in keratinocytes, and its cross-linking activity was thought to play a central role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope of terminally differentiated epidermis (38Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S.

A. 1998; 95: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study, however, Northern as well as Western blotting analyses indicated that TGase1 was also expressed in large amounts in tissues containing simple epithelia, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that endogenous TGase1 was mostly colocalized with E-cadherin and concentrated, although this localization was not exclusive, at AJs in simple epithelial cells. These findings prompted us to reexamine the physiological relevance of TGase1.The TGase activity detected using 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine as a substrate was also enriched in the isolated junctional fraction from the liver and co-concentrated with E-cadherin at AJs in cultured simple epithelial cells. However, this pentylamine is not a specific substrate for TGase1. Among the four types of intracellular TGases (types 1–4), only type 2 (TGase2) was reported to be expressed in various types of cells (52Thomazy V. Fesus L. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports (53Piacentini M. Ceru M.P. Dini L. Di Rao M. Piredda L. Thomazy V. Davies P.J. Fesus L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Western blotting with anti-TGase2 mAb (CUB7402; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) revealed that TGase2 was abundant in the cytoplasm of the liver and was not concentrated in the junctional fraction in contrast to TGase1 (data not shown). Furthermore, in cultured simple epithelial cells, TGase2 was not detected by Western blotting or immunofluorescence staining with anti-TGase2 mAb (CUB7402; data not shown). Therefore, the TGase activity detected with 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine in this study was mostly attributed to TGase1, although the possibility cannot be ruled out that as yet unidentified type of TGase gives rise to part of observed activity, and the TGase1 concentrated at E-cadherin-based cell adhesion sites appeared to be active as a transglutaminase within cells. The “membrane-associated TGase activity,” which was previously reported in the liver (54Slife C.W. Dorsett M.D. Bouquett G.T. Register A. Taylor E. Conroy S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), would be the same as the activity described in this study.These findings suggested that the TGase1-mediated covalent cross-linking of proteins is directly involved in the formation and maintenance of intercellular junctions, especially AJs. To date, only the noncovalent protein-protein binding in the junctions has been intensively analyzed. Western blotting of the junctional fraction with anti-TGase1 pAb revealed that TGase1 was concentrated in the junctions not only as a full-length 97-kDa form but also as higher molecular mass forms (see Fig. 3 B). Because TGase itself was known to be cross-linked to various proteins through its own enzymatic activity, in the junctions this “auto-cross-linking” also would produce higher molecular mass forms of TGase1. Furthermore, the numerous biotin-labeled bands shown in Fig. 6 indicated that in the junctions TGase1 used various proteins as substrates. Thus, in the intercellular junctions, especially in AJs, we would expect the presence of highly complicated multimolecular complexes, in which constituents including TGase1 itself were covalently cross-linked through the TGase1 enzymatic activity. Because these complexes would be resistant to extraction even with SDS, it would be difficult to analyze them with conventional biochemical methods, including SDS-PAGE.To understand the physiological functions of TGase1 in simple epithelial cells, several important questions must be answered in future studies. The first important question is how TGase1 is targeted to the intercellular junctions, especially to AJs, in simple epithelial cells. TGase1, but not the other TGases, was reported to be acylated with myristates and/or palmitates at its NH2-terminal cysteine-rich region, and this was thought to be the reason why only the TGase1 was anchored on membranes. However, to be recruited to AJs, other additional mechanisms are required. Furthermore, it should be emphasized here that even in simple epithelial cells TGase1 was not exclusively distributed at AJs. Taking into consideration that TGase1 forms large multimolecular complexes that include TGase1 itself, the mechanism responsible for localization of TGase1 in simple epithelial cells would be rather complicated.The second point to be elucidated is the identities of the major substrates for TGase1 in AJs. As discussed above, in the 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine cross-linking experiments with the isolated junctional fraction, various proteins appeared to be cross-linked by endogenous TGase1 activity. It is technically possible to isolate biotinylated, glutamine-containing proteins from the fraction using avidin-coupled columns and to determine what species of proteins are cross-linked with 5-(biotin-amido)pentylamine. Identification of the substrates of the enzymatic reaction would greatly help us analyze the cellular function of TGase1 in future studies. Third, it is necessary to determine the mechanism of regulation of TGase1 activity. We initially identified TGase1 as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from the junctional fraction of the mouse liver, suggesting that the TGase1 activity is regulated through its tyrosine phosphorylation. Although it was confirmed that some fraction of TGase1 was actually tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured simple epithelial cells by immunoprecipitation (data not shown), the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on the enzymatic activity of TGase1 remained to be elucidated.The results of this study shed light on the possible functions of TGase1 in AJs in simple epithelial cells. TGase1-deficient mice were reported to die within 4–5 h after birth (40Matsuki M. Yamashita F. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Yamada K. Kinoshita C. Fushiki S. Ueda E. Morishima Y. Tabata K. Yasuno H. Hashida M.

It was speculated that mice died of dehydration caused by skin barrier dysfunction, because the widespread expression of TGase1 in tissues other than the skin had not been demonstrated. However, they noticed that TGase1-deficient mice were smaller than controls, and preliminary studies identified some histological changes at least in the lung. Further extensive analyses of the TGase1-deficient mice will lead us to a better understanding of the physiological roles of TGase1 in simple epithelia.

Recently, TGase2 and factor XIIIa themselves were reported to possess such hydrolytic activities (56Parameswaran K.N. Cheng X.F. Chen E.C. Velasco P.T. Wilson J.H. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10311-10317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the TGase1-mediated covalent cross-linking is dynamically regulated in simple epithelial cells. Further studies are required to characterize the physiological functions of TGase1 in epithelial cells and to determine whether the TGase1-mediated cross-linking of proteins is one of the important and general mechanisms involved in formation, maintenance, and regulation of the structural integrity of simple epithelial cells, especially at AJs. —We thank Dr. E.

Because FA cells are sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), FA gene products could be involved in cellular defense mechanisms. The FANCA and FANCG proteins deficient in FA groups A and G interact directly with each other. We have localized the mutual interaction domains of these proteins to amino acids 18–29 of FANCA and to two noncontiguous carboxyl-terminal domains of FANCG encompassing amino acids 400–475 and 585–622. Site-directed mutagenesis of FANCA residues 18–29 revealed a novel arginine-rich interaction domain (RRRAWAELLAG). By alanine mutagenesis, Arg1, Arg2, and Leu8 but not Arg3, Trp5, and Glu7 appeared to be critical for binding to FANCG. Similar immunolocalization for FANCA and FANCG suggested that these proteins interact in vivo. Moreover, targeting of FANCA to the nucleus or the cytoplasm with nuclear localization and nuclear export signals, respectively, showed concordance between the localization patterns of FANCA and FANCG. The complementation function of FANCA was abolished by mutations in its FANCG-binding domain. Conversely, stable expression of FANCA mutants encoding intact FANCG interaction domains induced hypersensitivity to MMC in HeLa cells. These results demonstrate that FANCA-FANCG complexes are required for cellular resistance to MMC. Because the FANCC protein deficient in FA group C works within the cytoplasm, we suggest that FANCC and the FANCA-FANCG complexes suppress MMC cytotoxicity within distinct cellular compartments.

Fanconi anemia mitomycin C nuclear localization signal nuclear export signal polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis hemagglutinin polymerase chain reaction Chromosomal instability is a feature of many different mendelian cancer susceptibility syndromes as well as acquired tumors (1Wright E.G. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and may be induced by a variety of physical, chemical, and biological agents. Although chromosomal instability induced by ionizing radiation or ultraviolet radiation has been studied extensively, there is relatively little information on the molecular factors that protect cells against damage by other genotoxic agents. A number of such agents are known to induce apoptosis mediated by p53 (2Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar) in collaboration with other cellular proteins (3Fearnhead H.O. McCurrach M.E. O'Neill J. Zhang K. Lowe S.W. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); such protein-protein interactions determine the sensitivity of cells to genotoxic agents and antineoplastic drugs. Fanconi anemia (FA)1 is a human disease model for chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to genotoxic agents. Cells from FA patients have unstable chromosomes and are highly susceptible to apoptosis after exposure to specific clastogens, particularly bifunctional cross-linkers, such as mitomycin C (MMC) (4Auerbach A.D. Buchwald M. Joenje H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill, New York1998: 317-332Google Scholar). The phenotype of FA is pleiotropic and includes birth defects, bone marrow failure, and cancer predisposition. Somatic cell fusion studies have identified eight distinct complementation groups, designated A–H, and the genes defective in FA complementation groups A (FANCA) (5Lo Ten Foe J.R.

Although all three genes were cloned by virtue of their ability to suppress the toxicity of MMC in FA lymphoblastoid cells of appropriate complementation groups, the encoded proteins have no significant homology to each other or to other known proteins, save for limited homology between FANCA and heme peroxidases (9Mian I.S. Moser M.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our previous data as well as data from other laboratories have shown that FANCC is predominantly cytoplasmic (10Yamashita T. Barber D.L. Zhu Y. Wu N. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lightfoot J. Alon N. Bosnoyan-Collins L. Buchwald M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Forced targeting of these proteins to particular subcellular compartments has revealed that FANCC requires cytoplasmic localization (16Youssoufian H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and FANCA nuclear localization (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be able to suppress cross-linker-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the function of FANCC has been partially elucidated by its interaction with the microsomal membrane protein NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, an enzyme involved in the metabolic activation of many xenobiotics, including MMC (17Kruyt F.A.E. Hoshino T. Liu J.M. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 3050-3056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of other FA proteins, however, remains elusive and may involve a variety of functions including DNA repair, detoxification, and regulation of apoptosis (4Auerbach A.D. Buchwald M. Joenje H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill, New York1998: 317-332Google Scholar). We (18Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Kruyt F.A.E. de Groot J. van der Weel L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4866-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) have recently described an interaction between FANCA and FANCG within protein complexes found in non-FA but not in FA cells from several complementation groups. However, FANCA-FANCG complexes were not universally absent in all FA subgroups, and in the latter case the complexes were presumed to be functionally deficient. Therefore, a direct link between the expression of FANCA-FANCG complexes and cellular resistance to MMC could not be established. Also, except for an amino-terminal domain of FANCA required for interaction with FANCG in vitro, the precise structural determinants of this interaction were not known. In this study, we have analyzed the amino acid residues required for the integrity of these complexes in vitro. We have also modeled the FA defect in non-FA cells by deregulation of FANCA-FANCG complexes with dominant negative FANCA alleles. Our results demonstrate that the integrity of FANCA-FANCG complexes is essential for a novel cellular function that regulates resistance to MMC. COS-1 and HeLa cell were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. COS-1 cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran, and HeLa cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as described (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected HeLa cells were selected on medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual clones were isolated and characterized by Western blotting. Lymphoblastoid cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After electroporation, stably transfected lymphoblasts were grown in the same medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. The MMC growth inhibition assays were performed within 2–3 weeks of stable transfection by exposing cells (7.5 × 104/ml) to various concentrations of MMC. For HeLa cells and derived stable transfected cell lines, cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 10,000 cells/well followed by exposure to different MMC concentrations. Cell numbers were determined using a Coulter counter, as before (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FANCA- and FANCG-derived deletion constructs were generated by using standard PCR-based cloning strategies. PCR products were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) or the Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal vector pDR2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For site-directed mutagenesis, specific PCR primers were designed, and the products were subcloned into either pcDNA3 or pDR2, as indicated below. PCR-generated mutations were confirmed by sequencing. pcDNA3HA-FANCG has been described before (18Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Kruyt F.A.E. de Groot J. van der Weel L. Dijkmans L.M. Zhi Y. Arwert F.

Chimeric constructs encoding the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) or the nuclear export signal (NES) from the gene for the inhibitor of cAMP kinase as well as a mutant version were generated by appending these motifs to FANCA deletion mutants, as before (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Youssoufian H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cellular lysates and immunoprecipitation conditions have been described previously (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were generated using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the suggestions of the manufacturer. Proteins were allowed to form complexes in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After immunoprecipitation, samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. Antibodies used included the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus of FANCA (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal antibody, 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. The bands on some autoradiograms were quantified by densitometry. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with FANCA or modified FANCA constructs together with HA-FANCG in pcDNA3, as indicated. Cells were replated on glass coverslips and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy, as described before (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies included fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were identified by Hoechst staining (Sigma). Using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, we initially tested the interaction of FANCA and FANCG with each other in lysates of transfected COS-1 cells. We used both full-length FANCA and a panel of deletion mutants to map the binding domains. HA-tagged FANCG co-precipitated with full-length and carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants of FANCA using anti-FANCA antibody in the immunoprecipitation step and the anti-HA 12CA5 antibody in the Western blotting step (Fig.1 A, top). In the reciprocal experiment, full-length FANCA and the same panel of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants co-precipitated with HA-FANCG using anti-HA antibody in the immunoprecipitation step and the FANCA antibody in the Western blotting step (Fig. 1 A, bottom). In both cases, FANCA mutants lacking amino acids 301–1455 remained capable of binding to FANCG. Under similar conditions, co-transfection of HA-FANCG with FANCC followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments failed to reveal an interaction between FANCC and HA-FANCG (data not shown). These results extend our earlier studies that the amino-terminal region of FANCA mediates binding to FANCGin vitro (18Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Kruyt F.A.E. de Groot J. van der Weel L. Dijkmans L.M. Zhi Y. Arwert F. Scheper R. Youssoufian H. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10320-10325Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because of the concordance between in vitro binding assays and those utilizing cell lysates, we used the former to map the boundaries of the FANCG-binding domain on FANCA more precisely. In these experiments, both binding partners were visualized simultaneously by labeling the in vitro-translated products with [35S]methionine. The amino terminus of FANCA contains a consensus site for a bipartite NLS motif encompassing amino acid residues 18–35 (8De Winter J.P. Waisfisz Q. Rooimans M.A. van Berkel C.G.M. Bosnoyan- Collins L. Alon N. Carreau M. Bender O. Demuth I. Schindler D. Pronk J.C. Arwert F. Hoehn H. Digweed M. Buchwald M. Joenje H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To determine the position of the interaction domain relative to the NLS motif, we generated several mutants lacking the complete NLS (35–300), containing half of the NLS (29–300) or the entire NLS (18–300), and examined their ability to interact with HA-tagged FANCG (Fig. 1 B). The residues between position 18 and 29 were essential for binding to FANCG. By contrast, deletion of an additional 100-amino acid segment from the carboxyl terminus (1–200) had no effect on binding. These results demonstrate that residues 18–29 of FANCA are required for interaction with FANCG in vitro. The 11-amino acid domain of FANCA required for interaction with FANCG has no similarity to other known protein interaction motifs. Using the Chou-Fasman algorithm for secondary structure prediction, we noted that this domain is positioned within an α-helical structure. We evaluated the role of specific residues within this domain for binding to FANCG by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2 A). First, we changed the charged amino acid residues to alanine. Each mutant was translatedin vitro along with HA-FANCG and analyzed by immunoprecipitation. While the substitution of alanine for arginine at position 20 (R20A) had a relatively minor effect on binding, the substitution of two (Arg19-Arg20) or three adjacent arginine residues (Arg18-Arg19-Arg20) by alanine strongly reduced binding to FANCG (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, the substitution of alanine for glutamic acid at position 24 (E24A) resulted in a modest increase in binding. These results indicate a requirement for either arginine or other basic hydrophilic amino acids at positions 18 and 19 of FANCA for binding to FANCG. We then tested the roles of two nonpolar hydrophobic residues that are located in the vicinity of charged residues and the α-helix. The substitution of alanine for tryptophan at position 22 (W22A) resulted in a minor decrease in binding to FANCG (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, the substitution of alanine for leucine at position 25 (L25A) profoundly reduced binding to FANCG. Similarly, substitution by proline (L25P) completely abolished binding. In every case, the level of expression of these mutant proteins was comparable (Fig. 2 B,middle panel), ruling out the trivial possibility that the observed variations in binding are due to differences in protein input or stability. Because both proline, a residue known to disrupt α-helical structures, and alanine at position 25 compromised binding to FANCG, the requirement for an α-helix per se could not be determined. Taken together, these results demonstrate that positions 18, 19, and 25 of FANCA are critical for interaction with FANCG. Next, we performed deletion analysis on FANCG to delineate the region(s) involved in binding to FANCA. Several HA-tagged carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of FANCG were generated and tested for complex formation with FANCA. As before, FANCG mutants were co-translated and radiolabeled in vitro with wild type FANCA and tested for binding by immunoprecipation with the 12CA5 antibody (Fig. 3). Deletion of 37 residues from the carboxyl terminus of FANCG (HA-FANCG1–585) resulted in a strong reduction in binding to FANCA. However, although larger carboxyl-terminal deletions extending to the amino acid position 475 did not further compromise the binding, the deletion of a further 75-amino acid segment (HA-FANCG1–400) completely abolished binding to FANCA. These results indicate that at least two noncontiguous regions of FANCG contribute to interaction with FANCA: residues 400–475 are necessary for complex formation, whereas residues 585–622 strongly augment the binding. The interaction between FANCA and FANCG in vivo was investigated by studying their subcellular localization. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with vectors encoding FANCA and HA-FANCG. The use of the rabbit polyclonal anti-FANCA antibody and the mouse monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody allowed us to detect simultaneously the localization of these proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. The specificity of the anti-FANCA antibody has been demonstrated previously (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): in these experiments, it did not cross-react with HA-FANCG, and the 12CA5 antibody did not detect FANCA (data not shown). As before (18Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Kruyt F.A.E. de Groot J. van der Weel L. Dijkmans L.M. Zhi Y. Arwert F. Scheper R. Youssoufian H. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10320-10325Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), FANCA and HA-FANCG were present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig.4). Although the proportion of nuclear to cytoplasmic FANCA and HA-FANCG differed among transfected cells, there was close concordance in the subcellular expression patterns of these proteins: cells with high levels of nuclear FANCA also had high levels of HA-FANCG in the nucleus, and those with high levels of FANCA in the cytoplasm also had high levels of HA-FANCG in the cytoplasm. These data suggest that FANCA and FANCG co-localize in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The static co-localization of FANCA and FANCG may be coincidental, or it may reflect a dynamic association in vivo. To distinguish between these possibilities, HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-FANCG and either FANCA fused to the SV40 NLS (FANCA-NLS) or to the NES of the inhibitor of cAMP kinase (FANCA-NES), which show, respectively, nearly exclusive nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of FANCA (11Youssoufian H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7975-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consistent with an in vivo association, HA-FANCG was found primarily in the nucleus when it was co-expressed with FANCA-NLS, and it was found primarily in the cytoplasm when it was co-expressed with FANCA-NES (Fig. 4). As before (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no such concordance was observed between FANCA and FANCC by cotransfection of FANCA-NES or FANCA-NLS with FANCC (data not shown). These data support the model that FANCA and FANCG associate with each other in vivo. The complementing activity of several FANCA mutants was assessed after stable expression in the HSC72 lymphoblastoid cells that belong to FA complementation group A. Stable expression of the FANCA mutants was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown), and cytotoxicity to MMC was assessed as before (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although FANCA18–1455 was fully capable of correcting the MMC sensitivity of HSC72 cells, the FANCA29–1455 mutant lacking the FANCG interaction domain failed to complement this defect (Fig.5 A). We also tested the effect of cytoplasmic or nuclear enrichment on the complementation function of these mutants. Forced nuclear targeting of the FANCA29–1455 with the SV40 NLS failed to rescue its complementation function (data not shown). By contrast, the FANCA18–1455 construct remained functional when targeted to the nucleus with the SV40 NLS. However, cytoplasmic targeting with wild type NES abolished its complementation function. As a control, a mutant NES appended to FANCA18–1455 that results in both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization described previously (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) remained active (data not shown). These result suggest that (a) the ability of FANCA to bind FANCG is essential for its complementation function and (b) the functionally relevant interaction occurs in the nucleus. The notion that FANCA-FANCG interaction is required for complementation activity suggests that overexpression of mutant versions of these proteins that contain otherwise intact interaction domains should induce MMC sensitivity in cells with wild type patterns of resistance. To test this hypothesis, we generated stably transfected HeLa cells expressing FANCA1–1200, FANCA1–600, FANCA1–300, and FANCA29–1455. From each transfection, clonal cell lines were derived, and the expression of mutant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). Two independent clones from each mutant class were assessed for resistance to MMC. For each clone, the expression of the truncated protein was readily detectable and represented approximately a 3–6-fold increase compared with the expression of the full-length, endogenous FANCA protein in parental HeLa cells. The overexpression of all three carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants that are capable of interacting with FANCG induced hypersensitivity to MMC (Fig.5 B; data for the FANCA1–600 mutant is not shown for clarity). As before (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), full-length FANCA overexpression (also approximately 3–6-fold higher than in parental HeLa cells) did not induce hypersensitivity to MMC in HeLa cells. By contrast, similar overexpression of the FANCA29–1455 deletion mutant that lacks the FANCG-binding domain failed to induce MMC hypersensitivity. These results provide strong genetic evidence for the importance of FANCA-FANCG interaction in the regulation of cellular resistance to MMC. In this report we have performed co-precipitation, co-localization, and functional assays to demonstrate that FANCA and FANCG interact with each other in the nucleus to protect cells from the cytotoxicity of MMC. Because MMC sensitivity is a surrogate marker of chromosomal instability in FA cells, we propose that the interaction of FANCA with FANCG is important in the regulation of chromosomal stability. This interaction appears to be direct without the need for accessory factors. However, it is possible that a residual protein or another macromolecule in the reticulocyte lysate facilitates this interaction. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the localization of FANCA and FANCG is highly coordinated, and overexpression of mutant FANCA alleles that retain the ability to bind to FANCG resulted in a dominant negative effect by a mechanism that most likely involves the dislodging of FANCG from wild type FANCA-FANCG complexes. However, this observation does not exclude potentially important functions for other regions of the FANCA protein. Although FANCA-FANCG complex formation was shown previously to take place in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, a nuclear function was suspected (18Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Kruyt F.A.E. de Groot J. van der Weel L. Dijkmans L.M. Zhi Y. Arwert F. Scheper R. Youssoufian H. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . U. S.

The delineation of FANCA-FANCG binding domains allowed us to perform a genetic experiment using nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of FANCA. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the nuclear localization of FANCA-FANCG complexes is critical for cellular resistance to MMC. This is in contrast to the requirement for FANCC to remain in the cytoplasm to function: its major function is apparently carried out in the cytoplasm as nuclear targeting abolishes its complementation function (16Youssoufian H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that FANCC interacts with NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase and affects its activity (17Kruyt F.A.E. Hoshino T. Liu J.M. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 3050-3056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that at least two spatially distinct protein complexes regulate the cellular resistance to MMC. We have also mapped the interaction domains on both FANCA and FANCG. An unusual domain of 11 amino acids in the amino terminus of FANCA delineated by residues 18–29 was required for binding to FANCG. Two arginines (Arg18 and Arg19) in a row of three played dominant roles in contacting FANCG, but the third arginine (Arg20) contributed less to binding. The leucine residue at position 25 was also found to contribute to FANCG binding. This motif defines a new interaction domain, RRRAWAELLAG, in which the third arginine, the tryptophan, and the glutamic acid residues contribute little to binding, whereas the first two amino-terminal arginine residues and the eighth leucine residue contribute substantially more to binding. This region can potentially form an α-helical oligomer, which may be disrupted by the introduction of a proline. However, an α-helical structure per se may not be required for binding because changing the leucine at position 25 to arginine also abolishes binding to FANCG. Experiments to test this hypothesis further as well as to establish a minimum interaction domain are in progress. A previous study used a chimeric NLS-FANCA protein that lacked the amino-terminal 36 residues of FANCA and failed to complement the MMC hypersensitivity defect in FA complementation group A cells (20Naf D. Kupfer G.M. Suliman A. Lambert K. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although this failure was thought to result from impaired interaction of FANCA with FANCC, our data suggest a different model. First, the juxtaposition of the FANCG interaction site with the bipartite NLS on FANCA presents a potential difficulty in the interpretation of these data. In the present study, we circumvented this problem by appending the SV40 NLS to the carboxyl-terminal region of FANCA, thereby leaving the amino-terminal region of FANCA unperturbed. Our SV40 NLS add-back experiments demonstrate clearly that both nuclear expression and proper interaction with FANCG are required for the complementation function of FANCA. Second, we suggest that the failure of complementation of amino-terminal FANCA mutants observed previously (19Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Naf D. Wasik J. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4866-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20Naf D. Kupfer G.M. Suliman A. Lambert K. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was most likely due to impaired interaction of FANCA with FANCG rather than with FANCC. Indeed, we have been unable to detect an interaction between FANCA and FANCC (14Kruyt F.A.E. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and investigators who have reported such an interaction have suggested that it is likely indirect (12Hoatlin M.E. Christianson T.A. Keeble W.W. Hammond A.T. Zhi Y. Heinrich M.C. Tower P.A. Bagby G.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Naf D. Wasik J. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), involving a minor pool of total intracellular FANCC (19Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Naf D. Wasik J. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4866-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). By contrast to the FANCG-binding domain of FANCA, the FANCA-binding domain on FANCG appeared to be more complex involving two noncontiguous regions. Although residues 400–475 were important for binding to FANCA, the carboxyl-terminal 37 residues greatly enhanced this binding. The mechanism of this enhancement is unclear. One possible model to account for this finding is that the carboxyl terminus of FANCG forms a loop around the amino terminus of FANCA, and the two noncontiguous domains of FANCG interact with FANCA for optimal binding. However, it is also possible that there are two independent interaction sites with FANCA. The topology of this region may be clarified by structural studies of the FANCA-FANCG complex. FANCG is the last identified member of the FA family of genes and was cloned originally by virtue of its ability to rescue mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells from the cytotoxicity of MMC (21Liu N.J. Lamerdin J.E. Tucker J.D. Zhou Z.-Q. Walter C.A. Albala J.S. Busch D.B. Thompson L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, FANCG as well as FANCC (22Wevrick R. Clarke C.A. Buchwald M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are functionally conserved in other mammals. However, no orthologues have been identified in more distant species. Although all known FA gene products are capable of attenuating the toxicity of bifunctional cross-linkers, their precise functions remain obscure. Both oxidative stress and defective interstrand DNA cross-linking have been considered. Cross-link repair inSaccharomyces cerevisiae may require the function of genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair (23Jachymczyk W.J. von Borstel R.C. Mowat M.R. Hastings P.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, interstrand cross-link repair is not defective in FA group C cells, and the function of FANCC precedes cross-link repair (16Youssoufian H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the limited homology of FANCA to peroxidases (9Mian I.S. Moser M.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that FANCA also functions in a prerepair step, albeit in the nucleus. Thus, FANCA-FANCG and FANCC-reductase complexes may have functionally similar roles in their respective cellular compartments, and cellular sensitivity to cross-linkers may depend on the integrity of both complexes. Conversely, the disruption of these complexes by dominant negative molecules or small drugs could present opportunities for the chemosensitization of neoplastic cells to bifunctional cross-linkers. We thank Dr. Hans Joenje (Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for kindly providing the HA-FANCG construct, Dr. H. Zoghbi for use of the fluorescent microscope, Dr. P. J. Hastings for comments on the manuscript, and V. Gharibyan for technical assistance."

Our preliminary observations suggest that, in some patients with coronary heart disease with high serum Lp(a) levels, administration of aspirin reduced Lp(a) levels. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the effects of aspirin on the production of apo(a), the expression of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) mRNA and the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene promoter. Aspirin (5 mm) reduced the apo(a) levels in culture medium of human hepatocytes and suppressed apo(a) mRNA expression to 73% and 85% of the controls, respectively. Aspirin also reduced the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene transfected into HepG2 hepatoma cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal effect at 5 mm (44.3 ± 1.5% of the control). Sodium salicylate (5 mm) also reduced apo(a) gene transcription, whereas indomethacin (10 μm) had no effect. Deletion analysis of apo(a) gene promoter showed that promoter region extending from −30 to +138 is critical for the effect of aspirin. Furthermore, enhanced production, mRNA expression, and gene transcription of apo(a) by interleukin-6 were also inhibited by aspirin. These results demonstrate that aspirin reduces apo(a) production from hepatocytes via reduction of the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene with suppression of apo(a) mRNA expression. The suppression of apo(a) production by aspirin may at least in part play a role in the anti-atherogenic effect of aspirin in vascular disorders.

Science. 1989; 246: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Lp(a) has been shown to be deposited in atherosclerotic plaques (2Cushing G.L. Gaubatz J.W. Nava M.L. Burdick B.J. Bocan T.M.

Serum Lp(a) level is strongly influenced by genetic backgrounds and is not influenced by age, foods, or environmental conditions (10Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). However, in several disease states such as inflammatory disorders, serum Lp(a) levels are elevated (11Maeda S. Abe A. Seishima M. Makino K. Noma A. Kawade M. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 78: 145-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies demonstrated that patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases show higher serum Lp(a) levels (12Genest Jr., J. Jenner J.L. McNamara J.R. Ordovas J.M.

It has been reported that nicotinic acid can lower serum Lp(a) levels by as much as 38% (16Stein J.H. Rosenson R.S. Arch. Intern. Med. 1997; 157: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although several adverse effects by this agent hampers general clinical use for patients with high serum Lp(a) levels. Aspirin has been used widely in patients with atherosclerotic diseases, and its efficacy in preventing coronary heart disease has been established. Although the effect of aspirin is thought to be mainly due to an inhibition of platelet aggregation, other possibilities have not been ruled out. Because these patients are often complicated with hyperlipidemia, many investigators examined the influence of aspirin on serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels with negative results (17Singh R.B. Verma R. Mehta P.J. Rastogi S.S. Nutrition. 1991; 7: 125-129PubMed Google Scholar). Recent investigations on the action of aspirin have revealed novel mechanisms that aspirin affects transcriptional factors and an antioxidant protein. In humans, aspirin inhibits the activities of transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (18Kopp E. Ghosh S.

Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These effects may explain the anti-atherosclerosis, anti-carcinogenesis, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of aspirin. In addition, aspirin increases ferritin synthesis in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (24Oberle S. Polte T. Abate A. Podhaisky H.P. Schroder H. Circ . Res. 1998; 82: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereby aspirin may enhance endothelial resistance to oxidative damage. We have been evaluating the effect of aspirin on serum Lp(a) levels in several patients with coronary heart diseases or old cerebral infarction with high levels of serum Lp(a), and preliminary observations suggest that serum Lp(a) levels decrease after treatment with 81 mg/day of aspirin by 15–20%. 2A. Kagawa, H. Azuma, M. Akaike, Y. Kanagawa, and T. Matsumoto, unpublished data. Because serum Lp(a) levels are determined mainly by the synthesis of apo(a) protein in the liver (25Rader D.J. Cain W.

Invest. 1993; 91: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and because the synthesis of apo(a) is mostly regulated by the expression of apo(a) gene (27Azrolan N. Gavish D. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether aspirin modulates the apo(a) production, apo(a) mRNA expression, and transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene promoter using normal human hepatocytes and HepG2 hepatoma cells. Aspirin (Wako Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) and indomethacin (Wako Chemical Co.) were dissolved in absolute ethanol and added to cultures at a final ethanol concentration of 0.1%. Sodium salicylate and interleukin (IL)-6 (Wako Chemical Co.) were dissolved in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human hepatocytes from several individuals were obtained (Cell Systems Corp., Kirkland, WA) and cultured in collagen-coated 10-cm dishes and maintained in 5% CO2 in CS-C serum-free medium (Cell Systems Corp.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Hepatocytes capable of producing the highest amounts of Lp(a) were selected by using a TintElize Lp(a) kit (Biopool AB, Umeå, Sweden), propagated, and stocked for the following study. At subconfluence, culture medium was removed and fresh medium containing aspirin and/or IL-6 was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Culture medium was then collected, 10 mm benzamidine was added, and the medium was centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. The medium was concentrated by centrifugation using Centricon Plus-20 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Apo(a) levels in the medium were measured by TintElize Lp(a) kit. Because this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit uses polyclonal anti-human apo(a) antibodies for catching and detecting the apo(a) protein, both free and bound forms of apo(a) can be detected. Total RNA was isolated from normal human hepatocytes treated with or without aspirin and/or IL-6 for 24 h using a commercially available kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). RNA samples were quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm, and 1 μg of RNA in a 20 ml volume was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT)18primer using an Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (CLONTECH). One microliter of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was then subjected to PCR forTaq polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan) using both the forward primer 5′-ACCTGAGCAAAGCCATGTG-3′, corresponding to nucleotide numbers 99–117 (numbering according to McLean et al. (Ref. 5McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M.

(28Rouy D. Duverger N. Lin S.D. Emmanuel F. Houdebine L.M. Denefle P. Viglietta C. Gong E. Rubin E.M. Hughes S.D. J. Biol.

Linearity of the PCR reaction was tested by amplification of 200 ng of total RNA per reaction from 15 to 50 cycles. The linear range was found to be between 15 and 40 cycles. In no case did the amount of RNA used for PCR reaction exceed 200 ng/reaction. The sample were amplified for 25–30 cycles using the following denaturation, annealing, and extension conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. The amplified products were confirmed to be an apo(a) cDNA by sequencing analysis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were used as a control. Apo(a) probe corresponding to the region spanning +99 to +343 of apo(a) cDNA was prepared as described above and was ligated into the pCRTM2.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The resulting plasmid containing apo(a) probe inserted in the inverted orientation (3′ to 5′ in front of the Sp6 promoter) was digested with EcoRV and used as a template for the synthesis of the antisense RNA probe. Radioactive transcripts were prepared using [γ-32P]UTP and the Ambion RPA IIITM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Ten micrograms of RNA and 50,000 cpm/sample of the apo(a) probe or 20,000 cpm/sample of the β-actin probe were co-precipitated, resuspended in hybridization buffer, and incubated overnight at 42 °C. Unbound RNA was then digested with RNase, and the remaining radioactive RNA was precipitated, resuspended in loading buffer, and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to X-OmatTMAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. The intensities of the protected bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning. Chimeric luciferase plasmids were constructed with modification of a previously reported method (29Azuma H. Yamaguchi H. Mima N. Shirakawa M. Miyamoto K. Kanagawa Y. Watanabe A. Shigekiyo T. Saito S.

In brief, 1438-, 1088-, 698-, 441-, and 168-base pair fragments of apo(a) gene promoter extending from nucleotides −1300 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−1300), −950 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−950), −560 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−560), −303 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−303), and −30 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−30) (numbering according to Wade et al.

The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI,EcoRV/XhoI, EcoRV/XhoI,HindIII/XhoI, or EcoRV/XhoI site of pBS/KS− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resultant clones were digested with SmaI (3′ of the EcoRI,DraI, EcoRV, and HindIII polylinker sites of pBS/KS−) and XhoI. TheSmaI/XhoI fragments were cloned into theSmaI/XhoI site of the luciferase reporter vector pGL2/Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). HepG2 cells were cultured and co-transfected with 2 μg of a chimeric luciferase plasmid and 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) using LipofectoAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described previously (29Azuma H. Yamaguchi H. Mima N. Shirakawa M. Miyamoto K. Kanagawa Y. Watanabe A. Shigekiyo T. Saito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). At 16 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μl ofl-glutamine and various agents, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. All cultures without aspirin, sodium salicylate, indomethacin, or IL-6 contained the respective vehicles. Cell lysates were prepared as previously reported (29Azuma H. Yamaguchi H. Mima N. Shirakawa M. Miyamoto K. Kanagawa Y. Watanabe A. Shigekiyo T. Saito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (model 1253; Bio-Orbit Oy, Turku, Finland) by mixing 100 μl of luciferase substrate solution (Toyo Inki, Tokyo, Japan) with 20 μl of cell lysates. For measurement of β-galactosidase activity, 20 μl of cell lysates diluted 100-fold with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer was mixed with 200 μl of Galactone (Tropix, Bedford, MA), which was previously diluted 100-fold with 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 1 mmmagnesium chloride pH 7.8, for 1 h at room temperature. Then, β-galactosidase activity was measured following addition of 300 μl of Emerald (Tropix). Luciferase activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses of the data were performed by a pairedt test for serum Lp(a) levels (Fig. 1 B), and by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's test forin vitro experiments (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Figure 5Effects of aspirin on transcriptional activity of deletion constructs containing apo(a) gene promoter.Aspirin (5 mm) was added to HepG2 cells co-transfected with luciferase plasmid containing apo(a) gene promoter extending from nucleotides −1300 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−1300), −950 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−950), −560 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−560), −303 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−303), or −30 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−30) and pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid, followed by incubation for 48 h.

A, normal human hepatocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of aspirin and/or IL-6 for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT)18 primer using an Advantage RT-for-PCR kit. RT-PCR product of an expected size (245 base pairs) was obtained, and the intensity of amplified bands of apo(a) cDNA was quantitated by densitometric scanning with normalization to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. B, radiolabeled antisense RNA probes of apo(a) and β-actin were hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA, incubated overnight at 42 °C, and digested with RNase. Protected radiolabeled RNA was precipitated and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The size of protected bands was as expected (245 base pairs), and those intensities were quantitated by densitometric scanning with normalization to that of β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether aspirin affects the production of apo(a) from the liver, the apo(a) levels in culture medium from normal human hepatocytes were measured in the presence or absence of aspirin. The results showed that 5 mm aspirin reduced the apo(a) levels in culture medium to 73% of the control (Fig.1). Because the levels of apo(a) gene expression are known to play a major role in determining the hepatic production and serum levels of Lp(a) (27Azrolan N. Gavish D. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined the effects of aspirin on apo(a) mRNA expression and transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene promoter, using RT-PCR analysis, ribonuclease protection assay, and luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 2 A(lanes 1 and 2), 5 mmaspirin suppressed the expression of apo(a) mRNA, calculated from density ratio of apo(a)/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, to 60% of the control value. To quantitate more accurately the changes of apo(a) mRNA levels, ribonuclease protection assay was performed and demonstrated that 5 mm aspirin also suppressed the expression of apo(a) mRNA to 85% of the control values (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and2). Then, luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 5′ flanking region of apo(a) gene promoter extending from nucleotides −1300 to +138 (relative to the transcription start site) was constructed (pGL2/apo/−1300) and was transfected into HepG2 human hepatoma cells to assess the luciferase activity in the presence or absence of aspirin. The luciferase activity of pGL2/apo/−1300 in the absence of aspirin was taken as a control. As shown in Fig.3 A, aspirin treatment reduced the luciferase activity. A significant reduction of luciferase activity was observed at the lowest dose of aspirin (0.05 mm), and a maximal effect was obtained at 5 mm (44.3 ± 1.5% of the control value). The suppressive doses of aspirin are relevant to the serum concentrations in patients taking aspirin (1–3 mm) (19Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P. Science. 1996; 274: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). When sodium salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, was added at similar concentrations, the luciferase activity was also reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). However, it appears that a slightly higher concentration of sodium salicylate (0.5 mm) was required to cause a significant reduction in luciferase activity. Although aspirin is known to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, sodium salicylate does not inhibit the enzyme. In order to confirm that the effect of these anti-inflammatory agents was not mediated via an inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, the effect of a potent inhibitor of COX-1, indomethacin, was examined (Fig. 3 C). At concentrations comparable to the plasma levels in patients receiving effective doses of indomethacin (1–20 μm) (19Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P. Science. 1996; 274: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), no inhibitory effect of indomethacin was observed on the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene. These results are consistent with the assumption that aspirin and sodium salicylate can reduce the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene independent of prostaglandin synthesis. We have shown that IL-6 enhances the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene promoter (29Azuma H. Yamaguchi H. Mima N. Shirakawa M. Miyamoto K. Kanagawa Y. Watanabe A. Shigekiyo T. Saito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which may be the mechanism for the elevation of serum Lp(a) levels under inflammatory conditions. In fact, we confirmed in the present study that IL-6 (10 ng/ml) increased the production of apo(a) from hepatocytes (Fig. 1) and markedly enhanced the expression of apo(a) mRNA (Fig. 2, A and B,lane 3). Therefore, we examined whether aspirin can suppress the increase in apo(a) production, apo(a) mRNA expression, and transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene by IL-6. The results demonstrated that the increased production of apo(a) from hepatocytes in the presence of IL-6 (10 ng/ml) was significantly suppressed by aspirin (5 mm) (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2(A and B), RT-PCR analysis and ribonuclease protection assay also revealed that aspirin (5 mm) markedly suppressed the induction of apo(a) mRNA by IL-6 (10 ng/ml). In addition, IL-6 (10 ng/ml) increased the luciferase activity to 193.6 ± 7.5% of the control, and simultaneous addition of aspirin (5 mm) along with IL-6 (10 ng/ml) completely inhibited the IL-6-induced increase and further reduced the luciferase activity to 65.2 ± 1.0% of the control (Fig.4). In order to further elucidate which region(s) of apo(a) gene promoter is responsible for the actions of aspirin, four different lengths of deletion luciferase plasmids containing the promoter regions extending from −950 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−950), −560 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−560), −303 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−303), and −30 to +138 (pGL2/apo/−30) were constructed, and changes in luciferase activity in the presence or absence of aspirin were assessed. As shown in Fig.5, with all four shorter constructs examined, aspirin reduced the luciferase activity to a similar degree to that with pGL2/apo/−1300, although basal transcriptional activity varied with different lengths of constructs. These results suggest that the effect of aspirin on apo(a) gene transcription is mediated via a promoter sequence from −30 to +138, and that aspirin may exhibit its effect by modulating a transcriptional factor(s) that can bind to this region. The present studies demonstrated that therapeutically relevant concentrations of aspirin can effectively reduce the production of apo(a) from cultured normal human hepatocytes by suppressing the apo(a) mRNA expression and gene transcription. In addition, aspirin also reduced the enhanced apo(a) gene transcription and mRNA expression along with the elevated apo(a) production from hepatocytes induced by IL-6. Accumulated evidence indicates the close relationship between inflammation and atherosclerosis. In a prospective study by Ridkeret al. (31Ridker P.M. Cushman M. Stampfer M.J. Tracy R.P. Hennekens C.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar), elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein are shown to predict the risk of future myocardial infarction and stroke, and aspirin can reduce the risk of a first myocardial infarction with a significant decrease in C-reactive protein levels. Biasucci and colleagues (32Biasucci L.M. Vitelli A. Liuzzo G. Altamura S. Caligiuri G. Monaco C. Rebuzzi A.G. Ciliberto G. Maseri A. Circulation. 1996; 94: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) demonstrated that serum levels of IL-6 in patients with unstable angina are commonly elevated, are correlated with C-reactive protein levels, and are associated with the prognosis of the disease. In the light of these observations, there is a possibility that the inflammation-associated risk of vascular events is mediated at least in part by an IL-6-induced increase in serum Lp(a) levels. Therefore, one of the plausible mechanisms for aspirin to prevent these events may be to reduce serum Lp(a) levels, and large scale clinical studies for analyzing the effect of aspirin on serum Lp(a) levels are warranted. The rate of production but not the catabolism of Lp(a) plays a major role in determining serum Lp(a) levels (25Rader D.J. Cain W. Ikewaki K. Talley G. Zech L.A. Usher D. Brewer Jr., H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26Rader D.J. Cain W. Zech L.A. Usher D. Brewer Jr., H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The rate of Lp(a) production could be affected by transcriptional efficiency (29Azuma H. Yamaguchi H. Mima N. Shirakawa M. Miyamoto K. Kanagawa Y. Watanabe A. Shigekiyo T. Saito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), stability of apo(a) mRNA, post-translational processing of apo(a) protein (33White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and efficiency of apo(a)-apolipoprotein B-100 complex formation (34White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15471-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Among these steps, many previous studies support the importance of the expression levels of apo(a) mRNA to determine the serum Lp(a) levels. There is a correlation between serum Lp(a) levels and hepatocyte mRNA levels in cynomolgus monkeys (27Azrolan N. Gavish D. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), baboons (36White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (37Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Harders-Spengel K. Soutar A.K. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ramharack et al. (38Ramharack R. Spahr M.A. Hicks G.W. Kieft K.A. Brammer D.W. Minton L.L. Newton R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1294-1304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that gemfibrozil suppresses the expression of apo(a) mRNA, which leads to a significant reduction in plasma Lp(a) level. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that IL-6 and all-trans-retinoic acid enhance transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene in vitro, and treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid elevates serum Lp(a) levels in vivo (29Azuma H. Yamaguchi H. Mima N. Shirakawa M. Miyamoto K. Kanagawa Y. Watanabe A. Shigekiyo T. Saito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that aspirin can reduce the production of apo(a) from hepatocytes as well as apo(a) mRNA expression with a suppression of the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene both in the presence and absence of IL-6. From these results, it is plausible to assume that serum Lp(a) levels are modified by the expression levels of apo(a) mRNA, and that the levels of apo(a) mRNA are regulated mainly by transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene. The present results also suggest that new agents which are capable of reducing serum Lp(a) level can be created by screening their effects on apo(a) gene promoter activity. The molecular mechanism of action of aspirin in platelets, vessel walls, stomach, and kidneys is well characterized. Aspirin is shown to acetylate the hydroxyl group of a serine residue at position 529 in the polypeptide chain of COX-1, resulting in decreased conversion of arachidonate to prostaglandin G2 and ultimately to prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2 (39Patrono C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). However, because inhibition of COX-1 by indomethacin had no effect on the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene (Fig. 3 C), the mechanism of action of aspirin on apo(a) gene transcription appears to be different. In addition, sodium salicylate, which does not inhibit COX-1, suppressed the transcription of apo(a) gene. It has been reported that sodium salicylate affects prostaglandin-independent signaling process via an inhibition of NF-κB (18Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 40Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 41Weissmann G. Sci. Am. 1991; 264: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Aspirin is also reported to inhibit the activation of NF-κB by preventing the degradation of I-κB (18Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar) or by blocking the induction of NF-κB (19Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P. Science. 1996; 274: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and the activity of AP-1 via an elevation of intracellular H+ concentration (21Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or via blocking of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase family members (22Huang C. Ma W.Y. Hanenberger D. Cleary M.P. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26325-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a possibility that these agents affect the transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene by a similar mechanism(s). Apo(a) gene contains putative binding sites for several transcriptional factors including NF-κB at nucleotide −1074, AP-1 at +82, NF-IL6 at −1132, −999, −740, −606, −139, −82, and +97, and C/EBP at −770, −112, −54, and +102 of apo(a) gene promoter (Fig. 5) (30Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wade D.P. Clarke J.G. Lindahl G.E. Liu A.C. Zysow B.R. Meer K. Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, because aspirin and sodium salicylate can inhibit the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, the suppression of apo(a) gene transcription may be mediated by these transcriptional factors. The results obtained by deletion analysis suggest that a negative regulatory element(s) elicited by aspirin exists between nucleotide −30 and +139 of apo(a) gene promoter, and that a transcriptional factor(s) binding to this region may be affected by aspirin. Wadeet al. (30Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a possible negative regulatory element was present around a putative AP-1 binding site at +82 of apo(a) gene promoter, but that the binding of nuclear proteins to this site was not displaced by excess amounts of AP-1 oligonucleotide competitor. These results provide evidence that an unknown transcriptional factor(s) other than AP-1 is likely to be involved in binding to this site. Although the effect of aspirin on transcriptional activity of apo(a) gene promoter could be mediated by this unknown transcriptional factor, further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of apo(a) gene by aspirin.

We have discovered that islet cells, isolated from the pancreas of a PHHI patient, proliferate in culture while maintaining a beta cell-like phenotype. The PHHI-derived cell line (NES2Y) exhibits insulin secretory characteristics typical of islet cells derived from these patients, i.e. they have no KATP channel activity and as a consequence secrete insulin at constitutively high levels in the absence of glucose. In addition, they exhibit impaired expression of the homeodomain transcription factor PDX1, which is a key component of the signaling pathway linking nutrient metabolism to the regulation of insulin gene expression. To repair these defects NES2Y cells were triple-transfected with cDNAs encoding the two components of the KATP channel (SUR1 and Kir6.2) and PDX1.

It is characterized by inappropriate insulin release in relation to the corresponding levels of glycemia (1Aynsley-Green A. Dev. Med. Child. Neurol. 1981; 23: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,2Aynsley-Green A. Polak J.M. Bloom S.R. Gough M.H. Keeling J. Ashcroft S.J.H. Turner R.C. Baum J.D Arch. Dis. Child. 1981; 56: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Affected children run the risk of severe neurological damage unless immediate and adequate steps are taken to avoid profound hypoglycemia. Treatment involves administration of glucose along with drugs such as diazoxide and somatostatin that inhibit insulin secretion. However, in many cases this is not effective, and within the first few weeks of birth a near total (∼95%) pancreatectomy is required to control blood glucose levels.Recently, it has been shown that PHHI arises from defects in the regulation of insulin secretion. This is due principally to the loss of function of ATP-regulated potassium (KATP) channels. Genetic linkage has identified a susceptibility locus for PHHI within a region of chromosome 11 that encodes subunits of these channels (3Glaser B. Chiu K.C. Anker R. Nestorowicz A. Landau H. Ben-Bassat H. Sholmai Z. Kaiser N. Thornton P.S. Stanley C.A. Spielman R.S. Gogolin-Ewens K. Cerasi E. Baker L. Rice J. Donis-Keller H. Permutt M.A. Nat.

Science. 1995; 268: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), while direct recordings of beta cells isolated from PHHI patients (following pancreatectomy) have documented the absence of KATP channels (5Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Squires P.E. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Milla P.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Dunne M.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In beta cells these channels are composed of at least two subunits as follows: a K+ channel pore, Kir6.2, and an ATP-binding cassette protein, SUR1 (6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 7Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Open KATP channels set the resting membrane potential for the beta cell and a change in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio following glucose metabolism results in their closure and the initiation of a depolarization of the cell membrane. This in turn activates voltage-dependent calcium channels and the ensuing influx of calcium stimulates membrane docking and fusion of preformed insulin granules resulting in insulin exocytosis (8Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Insulin, Molecular Biology to Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1992: 97-150Google Scholar). A number of mutations in the SUR1 and Kir6.2 genes, which affect KATP channel function in PHHI, have been described (9Dunne M.J. Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Sanchez J.A. James R.F.L. Johnson P.R.V. Aynsley-Green A. Lu S. Clement IV, J.P. Lindley K.J. Seino S. Aguilar-Bryan L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Nestorowicz A. Glaser B.

The significance of this loss of channel function is that beta cells can no longer adequately control the regulated entry of Ca2+ ions. Since elevated [Ca2+]iconcentrations have been reported in isolated PHHI beta cells, this unregulated Ca2+ influx has been suggested to stimulate Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, which underpins insulin hypersecretion (11Dunne M.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 197-203Google Scholar). Recently, two related but clinically distinct disorders of familial hyperinsulinemia-induced hypoglycemia have also been linked to defects in beta cell stimulus-response coupling mechanisms. These are associated with gene defects in glucokinase (12Glaser B. Kesavan P. Heyman M. Davis E. Cuesta A. Buchs A. Stanley C.A. Thornton P.S. Permutt M.A. Matschinsky F.M. Herold K.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), a key component of the beta cell glucose-sensing mechanism (13Randle P.J. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and in glutamate dehydrogenase (14Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y.L. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). However, unlike PHHI, patients with glucokinase-hyperinsulinism of infancy and glutamate dehydrogenase-hyperinsulinism of infancy present with milder symptoms and are responsive to medical therapy.We have recently presented preliminary data on a beta cell-like cell line (NES2Y) that was derived from islets of Langerhans isolated from the pancreas of a patient with PHHI resulting from defective KATP channel activity (15Macfarlane W.M. Cragg H. Docherty H.M. Read M.L. James R.F.L. Aynsley-Green A. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we now describe how cell engineering can be used to repair the genetic defects within these cells by demonstrating that the restoration of ion channel function leads to the generation of a glucose-responsive human insulin-secreting cell line. The resultant cell line, NISK9, exhibited normal KATP channel activity, intracellular calcium regulation, and insulin output within the normal physiological range of glucose concentrations. This approach may be of value in engineering PHHI-derived islets for autotransplantation to treat the disease following pancreatectomy and for generating beta cell lines for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.DISCUSSIONPersistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy is a rare neonatal disorder with devastating consequences for the newborn. The clinical characteristics of the condition are heterogeneous, with most cases presenting symptoms within the first few hours of life with very severe disease. However, some cases present at several months to 1 year of age and even some adult cases have also been described. Drug responsiveness in PHHI patients is also highly variable, and in the majority of cases medical therapy is of limited use, and this can be directly correlated with a major loss in the control of insulin release (5Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Squires P.E. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Milla P.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Dunne M.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this syndrome is also heterogeneous. In 1994, familial disease was linked to chromosome 11p15.1 (3Glaser B. Chiu K.C. Anker R. Nestorowicz A. Landau H. Ben-Bassat H. Sholmai Z. Kaiser N. Thornton P.S. Stanley C.A. Spielman R.S. Gogolin-Ewens K. Cerasi E. Baker L. Rice J. Donis-Keller H. Permutt M.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and was later confirmed in multiplex Saudi Arabian families (22Thomas P.M. Cote G.J. Hallman D.M. Mathew P.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 416-421PubMed Google Scholar). This region of Ch.11 encodes both subunits of KATP channels, Kir6.2 and SUR1 (6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In those cases where mutations have been linked to the disease (23Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Wilson B.A. Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Stanley C.A. Thornton P.S. Permutt M.A. Hum. Mol.

Thus there are reports of non-Mendelian inheritance among discordant identical twins (24Santer R. Hoffmann H. Suttorp M. Simeoni E. Schaub J. J. Pediatr. 1995; 126: 1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and data to suggest that PHHI can be inherited in an apparent autosomal dominant way (25Thornton P.S.

Endocrinol. & Metab. 1997; 82: 1192-1194PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of maternally-imprinted genes in PHHI has recently been described. In these cases, the patient inherits a single paternal recessive SUR1 gene mutation, and a portion of the pancreas is reduced to hemizygosity because of the loss of maternal imprinted genes (27Ryan F.

Invest. 1998; 102: 1286-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Loss of heterozygosity in the affected beta cells results in insulin hypersecretion, but because of the loss of other maternally-expressed imprinting genes (such as the tumor suppressor genes H19 and p57KIP2), the pancreata of patients with this condition also have the morphologically distinct appearance of focal regions of beta cells hyperproliferation. This has given rise to the terminology of “focal PHHI” (Fo-PHHI) as distinct from “diffuse PHHI” which is not associated with loss of imprinted genes. In addition, spontaneous SUR1 gene mutations also give rise to PHHI, and each of these factors has hindered attempts to provide a concise genotype-phenotype relationship in the field. In previous publications (5Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Squires P.E. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Milla P.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Dunne M.J. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have described how the NES2Y cells were derived from a patient with diffuse PHHI and that the disease was manifest in association with the loss of beta cell KATP channels. As a result of the complexities of inherited KATP channel gene defects, it has still not been possible to identify the genetic lesions in this particular patient, but this is perhaps not too unexpected since an estimated 60% of all patients with PHHI remain anonymous in terms of the genetic basis of the condition even following pancreatectomy (29Glaser B. Landau H. Permutt M.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 55-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The NES2Y cell is a beta cell-like insulin-secreting cell line derived without modification from post-operative PHHI tissue. Although a number of rodent and hamster beta cell-like lines have been generated through viral transformation (HIT-T15) (30Santerre R.F. Cook R.A. Cristel R.M.D. Shar J.D. Schmidt R.J. Williams D.C.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), attempts to generate human beta cell lines have proved unsuccessful. It is unclear as to why the NES2Y cells proliferate in culture. As described previously (15Macfarlane W.M. Cragg H. Docherty H.M. Read M.L. James R.F.L. Aynsley-Green A. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it may be a consequence of the impaired expression of the homeodomain transcription factor PDX1, a major islet cell differentiation and lineage determination factor (19Jonsson J. Carlsson J. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Thus the NES2Y cells may represent a stage in islet cell development at which the cells have retained the ability to replicate while attaining a beta cell-like phenotype. Alternatively, the ability to proliferate may be a general property of neonatal human islet tissue, which has not been well studied because of the paucity of available tissue. On the other hand, the requirement for pancreatectomy for PHHI has made available for experimental purposes tissue from this source. Further studies will address the potential applications of the NES2Y as a model for beta cell replication. The present paper has focused on the properties of the cell line as they relate to the insulin secretory dysfunction in PHHI. A major finding was that the secretory defects could be repaired at the molecular level by cell engineering.The NES2Y cells were shown to reproduce the properties and key features of acutely-isolated insulin-secreting cells from patients with PHHI (5Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Squires P.E. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Milla P.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Dunne M.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus NES2Y cells (i) lack operational KATP channels, (ii) have markedly impaired cytosolic Ca2+ signaling mechanisms, (iii) constitutively release insulin at an elevated rate in the absence of stimuli, and (iv) do not respond to depolarization-dependent agonists through the release of insulin (Figs. 1 and 2). These same characteristics have also been recently described in transgenic mice that express a “dominant-negative” form of KATP channels in pancreatic beta cells (34Miki T. Tashiro F. Iwanaga T. Nagashima K. Yoshitomi H. Aihara H. Nitta Y. Gonoi T. Inagaki N. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11969-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) but not in “Kir6.2 knock-out” animals (35Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thus, as PHHI is a rare condition, the availability of the NES2Y beta cell is an important asset to ongoing studies of the molecular pathophysiology of the condition.The NES2Y cells retained some capacity to secrete insulin in response to elevated glucose (Fig. 2 B). This finding can be explained through the “KATP channel-independent” pathway of glucose-induced secretion. Glucose “augmentation” routes have been described in rodent (36Sato Y. Aizawa T. Komatsu M. Okada N. Yamada T. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 37Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 38Best L. Yates A.P. Tomlinson S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2483-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and human insulin-secreting cells (39Straub S.G. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,40Straub S.G. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These pathways are uncovered in normal beta cells by using pharmacological agents that eliminate the contribution of KATP channels to the operation of beta cells and are now recognized as accounting for the second phase of insulin release. As second phase secretion is dependent upon glucose metabolism and the concomitant entry of Ca2+, the lack of operational KATP channels in NES2Y cells coupled with the unregulated influx of Ca2+ will fuel glucose-induced secretion in these cells (Fig. 2 B). Similar findings have also been recently observed in acutely isolated beta cells from a patient with PHHI. 4W. M. Macfarlane, K. Docherty, and M. J. Dunne, manuscript in preparation. Defects in NES2Y cells were overcome following a triple transfection with cDNAs encoding SUR1, Kir6.2, and PDX1. The properties of KATP channels expressed in the NISK9 beta cells were strikingly similar to those reported in native tissue (41Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The recombinant channels were inwardly rectifying, inhibited by cytosolic ATP in a concentration-dependent manner, activated by ADP in the presence of ATP, underwent spontaneous run-down in isolated patches, and were modulated by diazoxide, tolbutamide, and efaroxan (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). The operation of these KATP channels is also clearly important to the function of the NISK9 beta cells. Not only did the transfection event substantiate the development of glucose responsiveness within a physiologically-relevant concentration range (Fig. 7 C), but it also governed both KCl- and tolbutamide-induced increases in the cytosolic Ca2+concentration and insulin release (Fig. 7, A-C) and controlled the inhibition of glucose-induced rises in cytosolic Ca2+ by diazoxide (Fig. 7 A). Experiments are currently in progress to determine the contribution of each of the transfected cDNAs to these properties. In cells stably transfected with PDX1 alone (NES-PDX1 cells), we know that insulin mRNA levels are increased following incubation in high glucose, whereas in NES2Y cells they are not. 5W. M. MacFarlane and H. M. Docherty, unpublished observations. This provides the first clear evidence for the pivotal role of PDX1 in regulating not only insulin promoter activity (as measured by transfected reporter constructs) but also insulin gene expression in response to glucose. These results suggest that PDX1 would be necessary when engineering PHHI-derived islet cells in order to provide the capacity to replenish insulin stores following secretory stimuli. Interestingly, NISK9 and NES2Y-PDX1 cells proliferated in culture with a cell doubling time roughly similar to that of NES2Y. This would indicate that PDX1 contributes only partially, if at all, to the ability of the PHHI-derived islet cells to proliferate. NES2Y cells stably transfected with SUR1 and Kir6.2 (but not PDX1) also express fully-operational KATP channels and secrete insulin in response to glucose stimulation. However, unlike NISK9 beta cells these cells fail to exhibit glucose-dependent insulin gene promoter activity because of impaired PDX1 function.NES2Y cells represent a key in vitro model system for the study of beta cells in the absence of functional KATPchannels. Our data have established proof of concept that in vitro gene therapy could be used to successfully reverse a metabolically related disorder. These results allude to the possibility that in the future, following pancreatectomy, acutely-isolated beta cells from PHHI patients could be similarly engineered for subsequent autotransplantation. By transgenic manipulation of the NES2Y cells, we have generated the first fully glucose-responsive human insulin-secreting cell line. We believe that these, and other PHHI-derived islet cell lines, are of major importance for in vitro studies of human beta cell function and potentially valuable in transplantation-based therapies for both diabetes mellitus and PHHI. Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI)1 is a potentially lethal disease of the newborn. It is characterized by inappropriate insulin release in relation to the corresponding levels of glycemia (1Aynsley-Green A. Dev. Med. Child. Neurol. 1981; 23: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,2Aynsley-Green A. Polak J.M. Bloom S.R. Gough M.H. Keeling J. Ashcroft S.J.H. Turner R.C. Baum J.D Arch. Dis. Child. 1981; 56: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Affected children run the risk of severe neurological damage unless immediate and adequate steps are taken to avoid profound hypoglycemia. Treatment involves administration of glucose along with drugs such as diazoxide and somatostatin that inhibit insulin secretion. However, in many cases this is not effective, and within the first few weeks of birth a near total (∼95%) pancreatectomy is required to control blood glucose levels. Recently, it has been shown that PHHI arises from defects in the regulation of insulin secretion. This is due principally to the loss of function of ATP-regulated potassium (KATP) channels. Genetic linkage has identified a susceptibility locus for PHHI within a region of chromosome 11 that encodes subunits of these channels (3Glaser B. Chiu K.C. Anker R. Nestorowicz A. Landau H. Ben-Bassat H. Sholmai Z. Kaiser N. Thornton P.S. Stanley C.A. Spielman R.S. Gogolin-Ewens K. Cerasi E. Baker L. Rice J. Donis-Keller H. Permutt M.A. Nat.

Science. 1995; 268: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), while direct recordings of beta cells isolated from PHHI patients (following pancreatectomy) have documented the absence of KATP channels (5Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Squires P.E. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Milla P.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Dunne M.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In beta cells these channels are composed of at least two subunits as follows: a K+ channel pore, Kir6.2, and an ATP-binding cassette protein, SUR1 (6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 7Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Open KATP channels set the resting membrane potential for the beta cell and a change in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio following glucose metabolism results in their closure and the initiation of a depolarization of the cell membrane. This in turn activates voltage-dependent calcium channels and the ensuing influx of calcium stimulates membrane docking and fusion of preformed insulin granules resulting in insulin exocytosis (8Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Insulin, Molecular Biology to Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1992: 97-150Google Scholar). A number of mutations in the SUR1 and Kir6.2 genes, which affect KATP channel function in PHHI, have been described (9Dunne M.J. Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Sanchez J.A. James R.F.L. Johnson P.R.V.

The significance of this loss of channel function is that beta cells can no longer adequately control the regulated entry of Ca2+ ions. Since elevated [Ca2+]iconcentrations have been reported in isolated PHHI beta cells, this unregulated Ca2+ influx has been suggested to stimulate Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, which underpins insulin hypersecretion (11Dunne M.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 197-203Google Scholar). Recently, two related but clinically distinct disorders of familial hyperinsulinemia-induced hypoglycemia have also been linked to defects in beta cell stimulus-response coupling mechanisms. These are associated with gene defects in glucokinase (12Glaser B. Kesavan P. Heyman M. Davis E. Cuesta A. Buchs A. Stanley C.A. Thornton P.S. Permutt M.A. Matschinsky F.M. Herold K.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), a key component of the beta cell glucose-sensing mechanism (13Randle P.J. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and in glutamate dehydrogenase (14Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y.L. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). However, unlike PHHI, patients with glucokinase-hyperinsulinism of infancy and glutamate dehydrogenase-hyperinsulinism of infancy present with milder symptoms and are responsive to medical therapy. We have recently presented preliminary data on a beta cell-like cell line (NES2Y) that was derived from islets of Langerhans isolated from the pancreas of a patient with PHHI resulting from defective KATP channel activity (15Macfarlane W.M. Cragg H. Docherty H.M. Read M.L. James R.F.L. Aynsley-Green A. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we now describe how cell engineering can be used to repair the genetic defects within these cells by demonstrating that the restoration of ion channel function leads to the generation of a glucose-responsive human insulin-secreting cell line. The resultant cell line, NISK9, exhibited normal KATP channel activity, intracellular calcium regulation, and insulin output within the normal physiological range of glucose concentrations. This approach may be of value in engineering PHHI-derived islets for autotransplantation to treat the disease following pancreatectomy and for generating beta cell lines for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. DISCUSSIONPersistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy is a rare neonatal disorder with devastating consequences for the newborn. The clinical characteristics of the condition are heterogeneous, with most cases presenting symptoms within the first few hours of life with very severe disease. However, some cases present at several months to 1 year of age and even some adult cases have also been described. Drug responsiveness in PHHI patients is also hi"

In addition to TSHR cleaved into A and B subunits, mature single-chain receptors with complex carbohydrate were also present on the cell surface. A low A/B subunit ratio indicated partial shedding of extracellular A subunits from transmembrane B subunits. TSHR cleavage at upstream site 1 (within amino acid residues 305–316) would generate a B subunit of 51–52 kDa. However, only smaller B subunits (40–46 kDa) were detected, corresponding to N termini from residues ∼370 (site 2) extending downstream to the region of B subunit insertion into the plasma membrane. The intervening C peptide region between sites 1 and 2 could not be purified from TSHR epitope-tagged (c-myc) within this region. However, the small proportion of B subunits recovered with a c-myc antibody were larger (45–52 kDa) than the majority of B subunits recovered with a C-terminal antibody. In conclusion, our study provides the first characterization of cell surface TSHR including their A and B subunits. Single-chain, mature TSHR do exist on the cell surface.

Remarkably, functional autoantibodies do not arise to the other, closely related members of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family. A potential reason for this difference is the unique subunit structure of the TSH receptor. Thus, unlike the other glycoprotein hormone receptors, a variable proportion of TSHR on the cell surface cleaves into an extracellular A subunit and a largely transmembrane B subunit that remain linked by disulfide bonds (2Furmaniak J.

This cleavage introduces the potential for antigenic stimulation of the immune system, for two reasons. First, TSHR cleavage into A and B subunits results in the deletion of an intervening “C peptide” region (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B.

Extracellular release of this polypeptide, either intact or in fragments, could initiate or propagate an immune response to the TSHR. Second, there is the propensity for the A subunit itself to be shed, at least in vitro (7Couet J. Sokhavut S. Jolivet A. Vu Hai M.-T. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol.

Initial evidence for a cleavage site closely upstream of amino acid residue 317, obtained by TSH cross-linking to a TSHR deletion mutant (3Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was contradicted by reports that amino acid residues 352–366 lie within the A subunit (10Ban T. Kosugi S.

However, residues 352–366 cannot be part of the A subunit because they are part of a C peptide region excised from the TSHR during intramolecular cleavage (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y.

The observed deletion of this segment (5Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B.

Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2135-2138PubMed Google Scholar), provided evidence for two separate TSHR cleavage sites, the second (downstream) site being in the vicinity of amino acid residue 370 (14Kakinuma A.

A recent refinement of this concept is that, rather than there being two distinct cleavage sites, cleavage at upstream site 1 (approximately residue 314) is primary and is followed by the sequential excision of the C peptide region, terminating in the region of site 2 (6de Bernard S.

However, in this report, there is a discrepancy between the small size of the B subunit polypeptide chains observed and their predicted size based on their N-terminal residues.Overall, a major problem in evaluating this somewhat confusing compendium of data is that previous studies on the immunodetection or immunopurification of TSHR subunits have been performed on thyroid tissue or cell homogenates that include TSHR products in the degradation and synthetic pathways as well as TSHR on the cell surface (4Loosfelt H.

Although in one study, surface-radiolabeled TSHR were examined, subunit forms of the receptor, in particular the B subunit, could not be clearly identified (16Harfst E. Ross M.S. Nussey S.S.

In the present study, we have succeeded in using a cell surface biotinylation approach to examine the properties of both TSHR subunits expressed exclusively on the cell surface.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and CultureTSHR-10,000 is a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line overexpressing the human TSHR (∼2 × 106receptors/cell) (20Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Overexpression was attained by transgenome amplification using a dihydrofolate reductase minigene approach. The TSHRmyc-10,000 CHO cell line was generated by the same method. To accomplish this, we transferred the cDNA for an epitope-tagged TSHR (TSHR amino acids 338–349 replaced with the human c-myc peptide EEQKLISEEDLL) (21Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Yamasaki H. Hayashi H.

Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 78: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were propagated in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml).Biotinylation and Extraction of Metabolically Labeled TSHR on the Cell SurfaceTSHR-10,000 or TSHRmyc-10,000 cells in 60-mm diameter culture dishes were pulsed (1 h at 37 °C) with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's, high glucose (4500 mg/l), methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 5% heat-inactivated FCS, as described previously (20Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, and the biotin cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide) ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce; 0.5 mg/ml in PBS, pH 8.0) was added for 20 min on ice. The solution was removed and the cross-linking procedure was repeated once. After aspiration, remaining reactive sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide) ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate was blocked by addition of 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, pH 8.0, for 10 min on ice with occasional agitation.Extraction of TSHR was as described previously (20Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (both from Sigma)). The cells were pelleted, rinsed, and resuspended in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. After 2 h at 4 °C with occasional vortexing, the mixture was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g and the supernatant was retained for immunoprecipitations. Where indicated, in an alternative procedure (23Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 2129-2134PubMed Google Scholar), 1.2 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin was added directly to the cell monolayer without scraping. After rocking for 2 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered and centrifuged as described above.Immunoprecipitation of TSHR and Separation in Biotinylated and Non-biotinylated FractionsThe immunoprecipitation procedure used has been described previously in detail (20Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, solubilized cell proteins were diluted 1:1 in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitors described above) and were precleared with normal mouse serum IgG prebound to 25 μl of packed and washed protein A-agarose (Sigma). Mouse monoclonal antibodies were added (16 h at 4 °C), and immune complexes were recovered using protein A-agarose. The following antibodies were used: (i) to TSHR A subunit amino acid residues 147–229 (A9; Dr. Paul Banga, King's College, London, United Kingdom; 1:1,500 final) (24Nicholson L.B. Vlase H. Graves P.

Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), (ii) to the TSHR B subunit (T3–365; Dr. Edwin Milgrom, Hôpital de Bicetre, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; 2 μg/ml) (4Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), or (iii) to the c-myc epitope introduced into the TSHR at residues 338–349 (21Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Yamasaki H. Hayashi H. Namba H. Yamashita S. Niwa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (9E10; American Type Tissue Culture; 1:500).After extensive washing in buffer B, immunoprecipitated TSHR were removed from the protein A by adding 3 μl of 10% SDS and 150 μl of buffer B (30 min at 50 °C). After centrifugation for 3 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted with 150 μl of buffer B, and incubated for 2 h with 25 μl of pre-washed streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) and centrifuged. The supernatant containing non-biotinylated TSHR was retained. The beads were washed four times with buffer B and once with PBS and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer with 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol (30 min at 50 °C) to release the bound, biotinylated TSHR. Aliquots of both biotinylated and non-biotinylated TSHR were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were included in parallel lanes. We precalibrated these markers against more accurate unstained markers (Bio-Rad) to obtain the molecular weights indicated in the text. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autography on Biomax MS x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Enzymatic Deglycosylation of TSHR ProteinBiotinylated TSHR bound to streptavidin-agarose or TSHR not bound to the streptavidin-agarose beads were incubated (10 min, 100 °C) in denaturing buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Enzymatic deglycosylation was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs).N-Glycosidase F digestion (100 units for 2 h at 37 °C) was in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40. Endoglycosidase H digestion (50 units for 2 h at 37 °C) was in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5. Samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above.Attempts to Purify the TSHR C Peptide Region Released into the Culture MediumMetabolic Labeling and ImmunoprecipitationTSHRmyc-10,000 cells near confluence in 60-mm diameter culture dishes were metabolically labeled as described above, with the following modifications. Cells were pulsed for 3 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution with 5% dialyzed FCS and 5 μCi/mll-[U-14C]amino acid mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). After rinsing, cells were cultured in standard F12 medium with 10% FCS. The medium was harvested after 16 h, and 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody to the c-myc epitope was added, as described above.Affinity Purification23 mg of purified 9E10 IgG was added to 2 g of pre-washed CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and tumbled for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then blocked with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, rinsed successively with 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.0, 0.5 m NaCl and with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl. F-12 medium with 10% FCS (1200 ml) harvested from 10-cm diameter dishes of TSHRmyc-10,000 cells was applied (1.5 ml/min) to the 9E10-agarose affinity column. After rinsing the column with 0.1 mammonium acetate, pH 7.5, protein was eluted with 1 macetic acid, pH 2.2. The fractions were evaporated to dryness under vacuum, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer with 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol (30 min at 50 °C), electrophoresed on 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated overnight (4 °C) with 9E10 (final dilution;1:500). After rinsing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400) (Cappel, Durham, NC). The signal was developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2.DISCUSSIONThe present data are the first to examine the properties of TSHR, including their A and B subunits, expressed on the surface of intact cells. Analysis of TSHR carbohydrate moieties establishes the efficacy of the cell surface biotinylation approach that we used to distinguish between cell surface and intracellular receptors. Previous studies on TSH cross-linking to TSHR on the surface of intact cells (for example, Refs. 2Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A. Buckland P.R. Petersen V.B. Beever K. Howells R.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 3Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) could distinguish between single-chain receptors and the A subunits of cleaved receptors, but the ligand-receptor complexes were not amenable to fine resolution of their sizes and the non-ligand binding B subunit could not be detected. Immunopurification of TSHR does provide more detailed information (for example, Ref. 4Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, such studies have been performed on cell and thyroid homogenates, which include mixtures of cell surface receptors and intracellular receptors at different stages of the synthetic and degradative pathways. Intracellular products are reported to be particularly abundant in transfected cells expressing the recombinant TSHR (17Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The data on cell surface TSHR expression clarify a number of puzzling or controversial issues. One issue that has been the subject of debate for many years is whether or not mature, single-chain TSHR exist on the cell surface. This possibility was raised by the detection of single-chain TSHR on TSH cross-linking to intact cells (2Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A. Buckland P.R. Petersen V.B. Beever K. Howells R.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Disulfide-linked, two-subunit receptors were well recognized (4Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Buckland P.R. Rickards C.R. Howells R.D. Jones E.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1982; 145: 245-249Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, high affinity TSH binding to the single-chain TSHR comparable to the cleaved receptor led to the suggestion that the former were physiological (3Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This concept has been vigorously disputed, and these observations have been considered an artifact of transfected cells (4Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,6de Bernard S. Misrahi M. Huet J.-C. Beau I. Desroches A. Loosfelt H. Pichon C.

Endocrinol. 1997; 137: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is proposed that single-chain TSHR precursors with immature carbohydrate have been “mistaken for the mature receptor” (6de Bernard S. Misrahi M. Huet J.-C. Beau I. Desroches A. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Pernollet J.-C. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 101-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and that such precursors are readily detected in transfected cells because of their abnormal abundance consequent to TSHR overexpression overwhelming the mechanism for glycan maturation and TSHR processing (17Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Misrahi M. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 137: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The present data clearly indicate that single-chain TSHR on the cell surface have mature, complex carbohydrate and are consistent with the previous observation of high affinity TSH binding to single-chain TSHR on the cell surface (3Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, single-chain receptors capable of TSH binding are not confined to transfected cells, but are also observed in a well differentiated rat thyroid cell line (2Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A. Buckland P.R. Petersen V.B. Beever K. Howells R.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, the same proportion of single-chain versuscleaved TSHR on the cell surface is observed over a 100-fold range in the level of expression in transfected cells (20Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), excluding the suggested limitation in synthetic capacity.Turning to the process of TSHR cleavage, the impressive accomplishment of de Bernard et al. (6de Bernard S. Misrahi M. Huet J.-C. Beau I. Desroches A. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Pernollet J.-C. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 101-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in affinity-purifying large quantities of TSHR B subunits from thyroid tissue and from transfected mouse L cells confirms previous findings that an epitope within a C peptide segment is excised from the TSHR (5Chazenbalk G.D.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with an upstream cleavage site in the vicinity of amino acid residues 305–316 (3Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y.

Misrahi M. Huet J.-C. Beau I. Desroches A. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Pernollet J.-C. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 101-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), supports the concept that the C peptide region is removed through a process of progressive cleavage or degradation. Regarding the region downstream of the excised C peptide segment, B subunits purified from homogenates of thyroid tissue and transfected mouse L cells reveal multiple N termini, the dominant ones being between amino acid residues 366 and 378 (6de Bernard S. Misrahi M. Huet J.-C. Beau I. Desroches A. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Pernollet J.-C. Milgrom E. J. Biol.

Taken together, these data suggest that, in contrast to our previous interpretation of available evidence, C peptide excision may not occur by means of two distinct cleavage sites. Rather, as reported by de Bernard et al. (6de Bernard S. Misrahi M. Huet J.-C. Beau I. Desroches A. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Pernollet J.-C. Milgrom E. J. Biol.

Regardless of whether there are one or two primary cleavage sites, the end result is the same, namely removal of a C peptide region between sites 1 and 2.Our present data provide new insight into other aspects of TSHR cleavage that have been diff"

We previously demonstrated that a yeast DnaJ-like protein, Ydj1p, was important for activation of heterologously expressed steroid hormone receptors (Caplan, A. J., Langley, E., Wilson, E. M., and Vidal, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5251–5257). In the present study, we analyzed Ydj1p function by assaying hormone binding to the human androgen receptor (AR) heterologously expressed in yeast. We analyzed hormone binding in strains that were wild type or deleted for the YDJ1 gene. In the deletion mutant, the AR did not bind hormone to the same extent as the wild type. Introduction of mutant forms of Ydj1p to the deletion strain revealed that the J-domain is necessary but not sufficient for Ydj1p action, and that other domains of the protein are also functionally important. Of three human DnaJ-like proteins introduced into the deletion mutant, only Hdj2, which displays full domain conservation with Ydj1p, suppressed the hormone binding defect of the deletion mutant. By comparison of the domains shared by these three human proteins, and with mutants of Ydj1p that were functional, it was deduced that the cysteine-rich zinc binding domain is important for Hdj2/Ydj1p action in hormone receptor function.

These cycles are mechanistically related to nucleotide-dependent changes in chaperone protein conformation, which are in turn regulated by proteins called co-chaperones. One of the more intriguing aspects of chaperone biology is that the co-chaperones can also have chaperone-like activity,i.e. they too can bind to unfolded or partially folded polypeptides, prevent them from aggregating, and maintain them in a folding competent conformation (see Refs. 1Hartl F.U.

This apparent dual function of some co-chaperones is not well understood, although it may be related to the specificity with which general molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70, may act.Well characterized molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70 and the oligomeric chaperonins Hsp60 and GroEL, typically display very little substrate specificity in vitro. The substrate binding pocket in Hsp70 can accept a wide variety of peptide sequences of 7–9 amino acid in length and having a hydrophobic character. Such sequences have been reported to occur in proteins every 36 amino acids (2Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). How then, does Hsp70 perform some very specific tasks, such as clathrin uncoating (3Chappell T.G. Welch W.J. Schlossman D.M. Palter K.B. Schlesinger M.J. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1986; 45: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 4Ungerwickell E. EMBO J. 1985; 2: 1401-1408Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar)? The answer appears to lie in the divergent nature of the co-chaperones, specifically of the class called DnaJ, named after theirEscherichia coli orthologue (also called Hsp40). DnaJ-like co-chaperones are all related by the presence of a 70-amino acid helical domain called the J-domain, which is required for these proteins to stimulate Hsp70's ATPase activity and alter Hsp70 substrate binding. Conversion of Hsp70-ATP to Hsp70-ADP leads to a change in peptide binding affinity that has been correlated variously with tighter peptide binding and also in peptide release (reviewed in Refs. 5Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chap. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar and 6Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Beyond the J-domain, dnaJ-like co-chaperones can be highly divergent. For example, auxilin is a protein that functions in association with Hsc70 to perform clathrin uncoating and is localized to the clathrin cage itself, but shares only the J-domain with DnaJ (7Ungerwickell E. Ungerwickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Linder R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). By localizing to the clathrin cage, auxilin recruits Hsc70 to the ideal location to catalyze uncoating. On the other hand, proteins sharing full domain conservation with E. coli dnaJ can be found in both humans and yeast, as can a plethora of other proteins sharing some but not all domains (5Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chap. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic DnaJ-like proteins sharing full domain conservation with E. coli DnaJ may have a general chaperoning function, since they can facilitate polypeptide folding in association with Hsp70 (8Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Terada K. Kanazawa M. Bukau B. Mori M. J.

These divergent DnaJ-like proteins have been characterized into three broad categories: type I (sharing full domain conservation with DnaJ; see Ref. 5Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chap. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), type II (sharing a more limited domain conservation by having an N-terminal J-domain and Gly/Phe-rich region, but not the central cysteine-rich zinc binding domain), and type III DnaJ proteins, such as auxilin, that share only a J-domain in common with all other DnaJ-like proteins, and this may reside anywhere in the polypeptide, not just at the N terminus.Two recent studies (9Terada K. Kanazawa M. Bukau B. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have directly compared the ability of type I and type II DnaJ proteins to participate in protein folding events in the presence of Hsp70. In both cases, only the type I DnaJ proteins (DnaJ itself, yeast Ydj1, and human HDJ2), which have the zinc finger domain could function in folding, while the type II DnaJ proteins (HDJ1/Hsp40) failed to do so, although an earlier study had shown that HDJ1 (Hsp40) can have some chaperone activity (11Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Two domains of type I DnaJ proteins are known to bind peptides, which may explain their role in folding events. One is the cysteine-rich zinc binding domain that is found exclusively in type I DnaJ proteins, and the other is a region found in the C-terminal half of type I and some type II DnaJ proteins (45% similarity; see Refs. 12Banecki B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones cooperate in the folding of steroid hormone receptors and in maintaining them in a high affinity hormone binding conformation (reviewed in Ref. 15Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). DnaJ-like co-chaperones are also involved in this process. Genetic studies, using yeast as a model system, revealed that mutation in a yeast DnaJ-like protein, YDJ1 (a type I DnaJ protein), led to reduced levels of hormone-dependent signaling by androgen receptors (AR),1 glucocorticoid receptors (GR), and estrogen receptors (ER) (16Caplan A.J. Langley E. Wilson E.M. Vidal J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Kimura Y Yahara I. Lindquist S. Science. 1995; 268: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The role of DnaJ proteins in receptor signaling has also been probed by biochemical methods. Depletion of endogenous DnaJ-like proteins from rabbit reticulocyte lysates inhibits association between GR and Hsp90, but addition of purified Ydj1 protein restored binding (25Dittmar K. Banach J. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In another recent study, association of the progesterone receptor with Hsp90 also required purified Ydj1 (or its human homologue Hdj2) and Hsp70 (26Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Together, these studies demonstrated that DnaJ-like proteins are required for proper maturation of steroid hormone receptors. What has remained unclear is whether there is specificity in the action of different DnaJ-like proteins in this process.In the present study, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to study the domain organization of Ydj1, and to test the specificity of different DnaJ-like proteins in the activation of heterologously expressed human AR. Previous studies have demonstrated the conserved nature of yeast with respect to folding of steroid hormone receptors, and their dependence on Hsp90 for activity (18Caplan A.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of yeast Hsp90 led to a reduction in hormone-dependent signaling by the AR that was correlated with decreased hormone binding by the receptor (19Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28697-28702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe results shown in this report are consistent with a role for Hsp40 molecular chaperones at an early stage in the activation process of a steroid hormone receptor. Specifically, a subclass of Hsp40 proteins containing the zinc binding domain are necessary for hormone binding by the AR. Deletion of the yeast YDJ1 gene results in loss of hormone binding, but this phenotype was suppressed by expression of other type I DnaJ proteins, such as E. coliDnaJ itself and human Hdj2, both of which have the zinc binding domain. The hormone binding defect was not suppressed upon expression of other Hsp40 proteins such as Hdj1 and Hsj1, or overexpression of Sis1p in a Δydj1 strain. What all of these proteins have in common is that they are type II DnaJ proteins, with each having a J-domain and an extended glycine/phenylalanine-rich region but not the zinc binding domain common to type I DnaJ proteins (see Fig.9). Furthermore, mutation of one cysteine in the zinc binding domain led to a defect in hormone binding by the AR, consistent with this region being important for Ydj1/Hdj2 function in this process. Besides the zinc binding domain, the J-domain was also found to be important for hormone binding by the AR.Two assays were used in these studies: direct in vivohormone binding and hydroxyflutamide competition. To a large extent, results from these assays correlated with each other. Decreased levels of hormone binding correlated with supersensitivity of the AR to competition by hydroxyflutamide. However, this was not always so. The major exception was the ydj1-C159Y mutant in which decreased levels of hormone binding by the AR were observed, yet the level of competition by hydroxyflutamide was wild type. The hydroxyflutamide competition assay was first described in studies on the AR in yeast strains that were mutant for Hsp90 (19Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28697-28702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The supersensitivity of the AR in these strains was very similar to the supersensitivity of theydj1 mutant strains described here. Our working hypothesis to account for this change in sensitivity is that the AR adopts a low affinity hormone binding conformation in the absence of molecular chaperones in vivo. This manifests in both reduced hormone binding and in the ability of hydroxyflutamide to compete more effectively. This assumes that the affinity of hydroxyflutamide for the AR is largely unaltered in strains that are mutant for different molecular chaperones. The ability of molecular chaperones to affect the binding of one ligand (R1881) but not another (hydroxyflutamide) suggests that the conformational changes involved are relatively small, and that the AR maintains its overall tertiary organization even in the absence of molecular chaperones. Indeed, only the hormone binding appears to be affected by Ydj1p loss of function since AR1–660 functioned normally even in the Δydj1 strain (Fig. 2). The results from the ydj1-C159Y mutant, however, were not consistent with this hypothesis. In this case, there was a defect in hormone binding similar to that found in the Δydj1 strain, although the ability of hydroxyflutamide to compete for this binding was wild type. This suggests that the two assays, direct hormone binding and hydroxyflutamide competition, measure different aspects of AR folding, although what these may be remains to be determined. One possibility is that the ydj1-C159Y mutant behaves differently from other ydj1 mutants or human type II DnaJ proteins. This may manifest in a wild type phenotype for hydroxyflutamide competition and a Δydj1 mutant phenotype for hormone binding.Besides the zinc binding domain, the J domain was also found to be important for folding of the AR hormone binding domain. The J-domain is a well characterized region of DnaJ/Hsp40 family members, and functions to catalyze ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70. This action is a regulatory step in the Hsp70 reaction cycle, and in its ADP form, Hsp70 has a more stable interaction with its peptide substrates. In the context of AR activation, the action of Ydj1p/Hdj2 may reflect a mechanism by which Hsp70 becomes more stably associated with the receptor. Initial recruitment of Hsp70 may depend on prior binding of Ydj1/Hdj2 via the zinc binding domain, which is known to bind peptides and assist in Hsp70-mediated folding events (10Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that Ydj1p binds to the progesterone receptor by direct interaction, and that this binding is necessary for subsequent interaction with Hsp70. Furthermore, both Dittmar et al.(25Dittmar K. Banach J. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and Kosano et al. (26Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) observed that excess Ydj1p was inhibitory to subsequent maturation of the receptors. Combined with the data presented in this report, a model for the action of Ydj1/Hdj2 may be proposed. In this model, Ydj1/Hdj2 bind to receptors via their cysteine-rich zinc binding regions. Presumably, the hormone binding domains of steroid receptors adopt a relatively unfolded conformation that is recognized by this region of the chaperone. Bound Ydj1/Hdj2 can then interact with Hsp70 in the context of the receptor itself, and may help position Hsp70 accurately for subsequent folding events. Stable association of Hsp70 with the receptor is catalyzed by the J-domain stimulating ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70. As discussed by Kosano et al., excess Ydj1p inhibits folding of the hormone binding domain due to its ability to catalyze Hsp70's ATPase prior to receptor binding, thus preventing association. Once Ydj1p/Hdj2 has successfully stabilized Hsp70 binding to the receptor, it may itself dissociate and recycle to another receptor moleculeWhat remains unclear, however, is the connection between the specific action of Ydj1p or Hdj2 and Hsp90. That such a connection exists is supported by the evidence shown here, that only these Hsp40 subtypes participate in Hsp90-mediated folding of the AR, and that the mutations in genes encoding Ydj1p and Hsp90 display a synthetic lethal phenotype (17Kimura Y Yahara I. Lindquist S. Science. 1995; 268: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One possibility is that only type I DnaJ proteins containing the Zinc binding region recognize steroid hormone receptors and bind to them with sufficient stability to recruit Hsp70. The co-chaperone called Hop could then serve to integrate the actions of both Hsp90 and Hsp70 by forming a bridge between them (reviewed in Ref. 39Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The alternative is that Hsp90 and Ydj1p or Hdj2 interact with each other, although there is no evidence for a direct physical association.The role of Ydj1/Hdj2 in this process may be similar to the role of auxilin in clathrin uncoating. In this case, however, auxilin is an integral part of the clathrin cage (7Ungerwickell E. Ungerwickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Linder R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Indeed, if soluble dnaJ-like proteins are added to a clathrin cage, they will also inhibit uncoating in a manner that is reminiscent of the inhibitory action of excess Ydj1p to hormone binding by steroid receptors (35Cheetham M.E. Anderton B.H. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4067-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Together, these examples may provide a more general hypothesis to explain the action of all DnaJ-like proteins, regardless of their domain organization. This is because different domains of dnaJ-like proteins may simply serve to correctly position Hsp70 on a substrate molecule. Once correctly positioned, the J-domain helps Hsp70 to lock into place. The cysteine-rich zinc binding domains of Ydj1p/Hdj2 (of type I dnaJ proteins) may recognize a particular conformation of an unfolded protein that may help Hsp70 to bind in a place where it can facilitate folding. Other types of DnaJ-like proteins may have a different or more restrictive range of substrates with which they can interact. Of type II proteins, for example, Hdj1 interacts specifically with the protein kinase inhibitor p58IPK and in doing so recruits Hsp70 into a ternary complex (37Melville M.W. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Song J. Morimoto R.I. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3797-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Type III DnaJ-like proteins may have their J-domains located elsewhere on the protein besides the N terminus, potentially providing an anchor or localization signal for Hsp70. For example, Sec63 has a J-domain situated between two transmembrane domains, thus providing a highly restricted space for Hsp70 to bind (38Sadler I. Chiang A. Kurihara T. Rothblatt J. Way J. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2665-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have found that folding of a steroid hormone receptor requires a subset of DnaJ-like proteins that all share the central cysteine-rich domain. We propose that this domain is important for targeting Hsp70 to nascent or unfolded receptor molecules. These events probably reflect early steps in Hsp90-dependent steroid receptor maturation. Molecular chaperones function in protein folding by repeated cycles of binding and release from their polypeptide substrates or targets. These cycles are mechanistically related to nucleotide-dependent changes in chaperone protein conformation, which are in turn regulated by proteins called co-chaperones. One of the more intriguing aspects of chaperone biology is that the co-chaperones can also have chaperone-like activity,i.e. they too can bind to unfolded or partially folded polypeptides, prevent them from aggregating, and maintain them in a folding competent conformation (see Refs. 1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar and 2Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar for reviews). This apparent dual function of some co-chaperones is not well understood, although it may be related to the specificity with which general molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70, may act.

Deletion of the yeast YDJ1 gene results in loss of hormone binding, but this phenotype was suppressed by expression of other type I DnaJ proteins, such as E. coliDnaJ itself and human Hdj2, both of which have the zinc binding domain. The hormone binding defect was not suppressed upon expression of other Hsp40 proteins such as Hdj1 and Hsj1, or overexpression of Sis1p in a Δydj1 strain. What all of these proteins have in common is that they are type II DnaJ proteins, with each having a J-domain and an extended glycine/phenylalanine-rich region but not the zinc binding domain common to type I DnaJ proteins (see Fig.9). Furthermore, mutation of one cysteine in the zinc binding domain led to a defect in hormone binding by the AR, consistent with this region being important for Ydj1/Hdj2 function in this process. Besides the zinc binding domain, the J-domain was also found to be important for hormone binding by the AR.Two assays were used in these studies: direct in vivohormone binding and hydroxyflutamide competition. To a large extent, results from these assays correlated with each other. Decreased levels of hormone binding correlated with supersensitivity of the AR to competition by hydroxyflutamide. However, this was not always so. The major exception was the ydj1-C159Y mutant in which decreased levels of hormone binding by the AR were observed, yet the level of competition by hydroxyflutamide was wild type. The hydroxyflutamide competition assay was first described in studies on the AR in yeast strains that were mutant for Hsp90 (19Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28697-28702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The supersensitivity of the AR in these strains was very similar to the supersensitivity of theydj1 mutant strains described here. Our working hypothesis to account for this change in sensitivity is that the AR adopts a low affinity hormone binding conformation in the absence of molecular chaperones in vivo. This manifests in both reduced hormone binding and in the ability of hydroxyflutamide to compete more effectively. This assumes that the affinity of hydroxyflutamide for the AR is largely unaltered in strains that are mutant for different molecular chaperones. The ability of molecular chaperones to affect the binding of one ligand (R1881) but not another (hydroxyflutamide) suggests that the conformational changes involved are relatively small, and that the AR maintains its overall tertiary organization even in the absence of molecular chaperones. Indeed, only the hormone binding appears to be affected by Ydj1p loss of function since AR1–660 functioned normally even in the Δydj1 strain (Fig. 2). The results from the ydj1-C159Y mutant, however, were not consistent with this hypothesis. In this case, there was a defect in hormone binding similar to that found in the Δydj1 strain, although the ability of hydroxyflutamide to compete for this binding was wild type. This suggests that the two assays, direct hormone binding and hydroxyflutamide competition, measure different aspects of AR folding, although what these may be remains to be determined. One possibility is that the ydj1-C159Y mutant behaves differently from other ydj1 mutants or human type II DnaJ proteins. This may manifest in a wild type phenotype for hydroxyflutamide competition and a Δydj1 mutant phenotype for hormone binding.Besides the zinc binding domain, the J domain was also found to be important for folding of the AR hormone binding domain. The J-domain is a well characterized region of DnaJ/Hsp40 family members, and functions to catalyze ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70. This action is a regulatory step in the Hsp70 reaction cycle, and in its ADP form, Hsp70 has a more stable interaction with its peptide substrates. In the context of AR activation, the action of Ydj1p/Hdj2 may reflect a mechanism by which Hsp70 becomes more stably associated with the receptor. Initial recruitment of Hsp70 may depend on prior binding of Ydj1/Hdj2 via the zinc binding domain, which is known to bind peptides and assist in Hsp70-mediated folding events (10Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that Ydj1p binds to the progesterone receptor by direct interaction, and that this binding is necessary for subsequent interaction with Hsp70. Furthermore, both Dittmar et al.(25Dittmar K. Banach J. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and Kosano et al. (26Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) observed that excess Ydj1p was inhibitory to subsequent maturation of the receptors. Combined with the data presented in this report, a model for the action of Ydj1/Hdj2 may be proposed. In this model, Ydj1/Hdj2 bind to receptors via their cysteine-rich zinc binding regions. Presumably, the hormone binding domains of steroid receptors adopt a relatively unfolded conformation that is recognized by this region of the chaperone. Bound Ydj1/Hdj2 can then interact with Hsp70 in the context of the receptor itself, and may help position Hsp70 accurately for subsequent folding events. Stable association of Hsp70 with the receptor is catalyzed by the J-domain stimulating ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70. As discussed by Kosano et al., excess Ydj1p inhibits folding of the hormone binding domain due to its ability to catalyze Hsp70's ATPase prior to receptor binding, thus preventing association. Once Ydj1p/Hdj2 has successfully stabilized Hsp70 binding to the receptor, it may itself dissociate and recycle to another receptor moleculeWhat remains unclear, however, is the connection between the specific action of Ydj1p or Hdj2 and Hsp90. That such a connection exists is supported by the evidence shown here, that only these Hsp40 subtypes participate in Hsp90-mediated folding of the AR, and that the mutations in genes encoding Ydj1p and Hsp90 display a synthetic lethal phenotype (17Kimura Y Yahara I. Lindquist S. Science. 1995; 268: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One possibility is that only type I DnaJ proteins containing the Zinc binding region recognize steroid hormone receptors and bind to them with sufficient stability to recruit Hsp70. The co-chaperone called Hop could then serve to integrate the actions of both Hsp90 and Hsp70 by forming a bridge between them (reviewed in Ref. 39Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The alternative is that Hsp90 and Ydj1p or Hdj2 interact with each other, although there is no evidence for a direct physical association.The role of Ydj1/Hdj2 in this process may be similar to the role of auxilin in clathrin uncoating. In this case, however, auxilin is an integral part of the clathrin cage (7Ungerwickell E. Ungerwickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Linder R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Indeed, if soluble dnaJ-like proteins are added to a clathrin cage, they will also inhibit uncoating in a manner that is reminiscent of the inhibitory action of excess Ydj1p to hormone binding by steroid receptors (35Cheetham M.E. Anderton B.H. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4067-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Together, these examples may provide a more general hypothesis to explain the action of all DnaJ-like proteins, regardless of their domain organization. This is because different domains of dnaJ-like proteins may simply serve to correctly position Hsp70 on a substrate molecule. Once correctly positioned, the J-domain helps Hsp70 to lock into place. The cysteine-rich zinc binding domains of Ydj1p/Hdj2 (of type I dnaJ proteins) may recognize a particular conformation of an unfolded protein that may help Hsp70 to bind in a place where it can facilitate folding. Other types of DnaJ-like proteins may have a different or more restrictive range of substrates with which they can interact. Of type II proteins, for example, Hdj1 interacts specifically with the protein kinase inhibitor p58IPK and in doing so recruits Hsp70 into a ternary complex (37Melville M.W. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Song J. Morimoto R.I. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3797-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Type III DnaJ-like proteins may have their J-domains located elsewhere on the protein besides the N terminus, potentially providing an anchor or localization signal for Hsp70. For example, Sec63 has a J-domain situated between two transmembrane domains, thus providing a highly restricted space for Hsp70 to bind (38Sadler I. Chiang A. Kurihara T. Rothblatt J. Way J. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2665-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have found that folding of a steroid hormone receptor requires a subset of DnaJ-like proteins that all share the central cysteine-rich domain. We propose that this domain is important for targeting Hsp70 to nascent or unfolded receptor molecules. These events probably reflect early steps in Hsp90-dependent steroid receptor maturation. The results shown in this report are consistent with a role for Hsp40 molecular chaperones at an early stage in the activation process of a steroid hormone receptor.

Sperling M.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1771-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) GH receptor genes have been partially characterized. A feature that is common to the GH receptor transcripts from these different species is the heterogeneity in the 5′-untranslated region (9Edens A. Talamantes F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 559-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity in the 5′-UTR results from splicing of the various exon 1 fragments to a common splice site located 11 bp upstream of the initiating ATG. Whereas the number of 5′-untranslated exons varies among species, in all examples the location of the splice site from the initiating ATG is constant. In the human liver there are at least eight distinct 5′-UTRs (V1–V8), with the most common GH receptor variant being termed V1 (9Edens A. Talamantes F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 559-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The identity and distribution of the 5′-untranslated exons in other tissues of the body, in which significant expression of GH receptor occurs and which are targets of GH action, such as kidney and heart, are as yet unknown. In the rat five distinct 5′-UTRs (GHR1–5) have been identified (10Domene H.M. Cassorla F. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D.

The class of RNA containing the GHR15′-UTR variant is expressed only in liver, is far more abundant in females than in males, and is specifically increased during pregnancy (11Baumbach W.R.

Another UTR termed exon 1B displays a striking GC content of 79% and is homologous to the human V2, rat GHR2, and mouse L2. In the cow three 5′-UTRs, termed 1A, 1B, and 1C, have been identified (7Jiang H. Okamura C.S. Lucy M.C. J. Biol.

Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Expression of the L1 and L2 transcripts is regulated in a tissue- and development stage-specific manner. The L1-GH receptor transcript is expressed in liver only during pregnancy (3Schwartzbauer G. Yu J.H. Cheng H. Menon R.K. J. Biol.

Barrett B.A. Bikbulatova L. Ilkbahar Y. Wu K. Talamantes F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the placenta L2-GHR UTRs are more abundant than L1-GHR UTRs. Information regarding the specific factors regulating expression of the different UTRs is at present limited to that for the mouse L1 UTR. All identified proximal and distal regulatory elements contain a core CCAAT sequence (4Schwartzbauer G. Menon R.K. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5236-5239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most distal cis-element identified to date in the mouse promoter is located 3.6 kb 5′ to the transcription start site, and two CCAAT box-binding proteins, MSY-1 and NF-Y, regulate the activity of the L1 promoter via interaction with thiscis-element (3Schwartzbauer G.

In contrast to the L1 transcript, there is a paucity of information regarding thecis-elements and trans-acting factors regulating expression of the L2 transcript of the murine GH receptor gene. The current report describes the identification and partial characterization of the promoter-regulatory region of the L2 transcript of the murine GH receptor gene. In this report we present data that define the location of the transcription start site, demonstrate promoter activity in the 5′-flanking region of the L2 transcript of the murine GH receptor gene, establish that the Sp family of proteins regulate expression of the L2 transcript, and provide evidence to indicate that alterations in the levels of the Sp proteins play a role in ontogenic profile of GH receptor gene expression in the liver. The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used in these experiments (residues altered in the mutant oligonucleotide are indicated in lowercase type): L2-A, TTTCACCCCGCCCCCTTCCTC; L2-A-m, CCCTTCCCAGTTTCACCaataaCCCTTCCTCCTCCCCAAGCC; L2-REV, GTTTCGCCTCGGGAGACAGAA; L2F4, CTCCCTTCCCAGTTTCA; L2F5, CTCCCCAAGCCTGACAA; Sp1, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC; Sp1-m, ATTCGATCGGttCGGGGCGAGC; GL5, CGCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA; random, CCCATGTTAGAATCCCAGCTTATACCCGCAGGCACAACATT. Where necessary double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing of synthetic oligonucleotides with the respective complimentary sequences. Extension reaction was carried out with 50 μg of adult mouse total RNA with synthetic oligonucleotide complimentary to a portion of the L2 transcript of the GH receptor mRNA. The 21-base oligonucleotide designated L2-REV (see Fig. 2) is defined by complimentarity of its 5′-end beginning 36 nucleotides upstream from the translational start site of the GH receptor mRNA (13Smith W.C. Kuniyoshi J. Talamantes F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The primer was 32P end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and hybridized with RNA in 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl (pH 6.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm dNTPs. The extension reaction was initiated by the addition of 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) and allowed to proceed for 120 min at 37 °C. After termination of the reaction, the reaction products were size fractionated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The sizes of the extension products were determined both by including radiolabeledHinfI digested φX174 DNA on the gel and by concurrently electrophoresing a sequencing reaction. To confirm the transcription start site of the reporter constructs, primer extension experiments were carried out with total RNA isolated from transfected cells and a primer (GL5) complimentary to the sequence of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). A 517-bpXbaI-SmaI fragment containing the upstream region of the L2 transcript was subcloned into the plasmid pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) to create plasmid pSK/66b/0.6. Using experimentally established sequence information from this clone, polymerase chain reaction, and routine cloning strategies, the plasmid pNoTA/T7/L2-mGHR14 was created that contained 115 bp of exon 2 fused to 605 bp of the genomic DNA upstream of the putative transcription start site for the L2 UTR. Ribonuclease protection assay was carried out with 50 μg of total RNA and an antisense RNA probe generated by transcription of the EcoRI linearized plasmid pNoTA/T7/L2-mGHR14 with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP. The probe protects a 314-bp fragment that corresponds to the L2 transcript and a 117-bp fragment corresponding to a part of exon 2 of the GH receptor mRNA and is thus common to both the L1 and L2 transcripts. Hybridization at 42 °C and RNase digestion with RNase A/T1 mixture were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). Following digestion with RNase, the RNase-resistant products were size-fractionated on a denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For quantitation of individual transcripts, the radioactivity of the individual band was equalized for the number of uracil nucleotides in the transcript. Nuclear extracts from mouse liver were prepared as described previously (14Menon R.K. Stephan D.A. Singh M. Morris Jr., S.M. Zou L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8851-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors (leupeptin 2 μg/ml, pepstatin 1 μg/ml, and aprotinin 1%) were included in the buffers used to prepare the nuclear extracts. Double-stranded DNA fragments used as probes were obtained by annealing complementary custom synthesized single-stranded oligonucleotides. The DNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 30 fmol of DNA was added to 1 μg of nuclear extract or 1 footprint unit of recombinant Sp1 protein (Santa Cruz Biotech) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mmNaCl, bovine serum albumin (50 μg/ml), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at room temperature through an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 80:1) with 90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.5), 2 mm EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography with intensifying screens (NEN Life Science Products) at −80 °C. Competition experiments included the addition of excess unlabeled DNA fragments to the reaction mix. In some experiments nuclear extracts were incubated with the indicated amounts of polyclonal antibodies against Sp1 (sc-59x), Sp2 (sc-643x), Sp3 (sc-644x), or Sp4 (sc-645x) (Santa Cruz Biotech), for 30 min at room temperature before addition to the binding reactions. Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al. (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) using either the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or the Fmol sequencing kit (Promega). Sequencing primers either were complementary to the canonical T3, T7, or SP6 sites flanking the multiple cloning site of the vector or were complementary to experimentally established sequences. The sequence data were managed using the sequence analysis program MacVector5.0 (Oxford Molecular Group, Inc.). Luciferase reporter gene constructs were engineered to contain various portions of the GH receptor 5′-flanking region. Construction of the reporter gene-GH receptor 5′-flanking region hybrids were as follows: an approximately 2.0-kb sized SmaI fragment from the 66B lambda clone (courtesy of Dr. Frank Talamantes, University of California at Santa Cruz) containing the 5′-flanking region and extending 110 bp into the L2 UTR was subcloned into the corresponding site in the polylinker of pGL3-Basic (Promega) to create pGL3B-L2[−2.0]. Digestion of pGL3B-L2[−2.0] with SacI or NheI followed by religation resulted in the creation of pGL3B-L2[−0.7] and pGL3B-L2[−210], respectively. pGL3B-L2[−75] and pGL3B-L2[−43] were engineered by using polymerase chain reaction; the 5′-ends of these constructs were defined by the oligonucleotides L2F4 and L2F5, respectively. pGL3B-L2[−75 m] was created by incorporating the mutation defined in the oligonucleotide L2-A-m into pGL2B-L2[−75] using QuikChange (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced through the vector-insert junctions to ensure nucleotide fidelity and verify directionality. The culture media used for tissue culture experiments were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise stated. BNL CL.2 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (with nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and Earle's balanced salt solution), 10% fetal calf serum, with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). 0.25 × 106 cells were plated on 35-mm plates 24 h prior to transfection. 3 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected per plate using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the experiments involving decoy oligonucleotides, 0.9 or 1.8 μg of relevant double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild type or mutagenized Sp1-binding site sequence were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of pGL3-L2[−75]. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then supplemented with medium for 40 h prior to harvest for luciferase assay. For estimation of luciferase activity the plates were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested by the addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer (Dual Luciferase Assay System; Promega). Following a brief freeze-thaw cycle the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 2–3 min at 12,000 × g. 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were then immediately processed for sequential quantitation of both firefly and Renilla luciferase activity (Dual Luciferase Assay System; Promega) using a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence). All transfections were performed in duplicate. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection of 0.2 μg of either the plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) expressing the Renillaluciferase (deletional analysis) or plasmid RSV/β-gal in which β-galactosidase expression is directed by the Rous sarcoma viral promoter (decoy experiments). The results of the luciferase assay are expressed in relative light units equalized for transfection efficiency. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Statistical differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance. pvalues equal to or less than 0.05 were considered significant. Schneider Drosophila Line 2 (SL2) cells were grown in 10-cm dishes in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were allowed to grow to a confluency of 50–60% prior to commencement of transient transfection experiments. 31 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected per plate using the calcium phosphate transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.). To investigate the role of Sp1 and Sp3 in regulating the activity of the GH receptor promoter, 12 μg of the reporter plasmids containing the GH receptor promoter fragments were co-transfected with varying amounts (0.25–16 μg) of Sp1 (pAct-Sp1) and/or Sp3 (pPacUSp3) expression plasmids. 3 μg of a plasmid RSV/β-gal was included in each transfection mixture to enable monitoring of transfection efficiency. The cells were exposed to the DNA precipitate for 48 h prior to being harvested and processed for chemiluminescent assays for measurement of luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase activity (CLONTECH). 15-μg aliquots of nuclear protein from mouse liver were heated for 3 min at 90 °C in 62.5 mm Tris HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.05% SDS, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. The protein samples were then electrophoresed through a 4% stacking, 10% resolving, discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel in 25 mmTris HCl, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS buffer. High and low molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad Laboratories) were also concurrently electrophoresed. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 15% methanol, pH 10.5) for 1 h. The nitrocellulose filters were then soaked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1× PBS, and 0.1% Tween-20 and subsequently probed with antibody against the specified protein using the ECL enhanced chemiluminscence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, blots were sequentially probed for different proteins following removal of primary and secondary antibodies from the membranes by incubation with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50 °C. The primary antibodies used were anti-Sp3 (sc-644x, Santa Cruz Biotech) or anti-YY1 (sc-1703x, Santa Cruz Biotech). Primer extension was performed using reverse transcriptase after end-labeled antisense oligonucleotide (L2-REV) was hybridized to total cellular RNA from nonpregnant mouse liver. The extension of L2-REV consistently resulted in three specific bands: one major band measuring 195 nucleotides and two minor bands of 140 and 117 nucleotides in lengths (Fig. 1 A). To precisely localize the transcription start sites in the 5′-untranslated region, ribonuclease protection assays were performed. 32P-Labeled antisense RNA, transcribed from the appropriate strand of pNoTA/T7/L2-mGHR14, was hybridized to total cellular RNA from nonpregnant mouse liver and digested with RNase A and T1. The major protected bands were approximately 118 and 311 nucleotides in length (Fig. 1 B). The shorter band corresponds to exon 2, and the longer band corresponds to the major transcription start site mapped by the primer extension experiment at 210 bp upstream of the initiating ATG. Quantitation of the radioactivity in the bands revealed that in the liver RNA from nonpregnant mouse (Fig. 1 B, lane C), the longer band representing L2 UTR containing GH receptor mRNA accounted for 56% of the total GH receptor RNA; the remaining 44% of the mRNA was in the shorter band representing non-L2 UTR containing GH receptor mRNA. In contrast in liver RNA from pregnant mouse approximately 98% of the mRNA was in the non-L2 band while 2% was in the L2 band. The sequence upstream of the transcription start site is GC-rich (69% up to −213 bp from transcription start site). Comparison with the transcription factor data base TRANSFAC (16Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter T. Hermjakob H. Kel A. Kel O. Ignatieva E. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya N.L. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) failed to reveal consensus sequences for either a TATA or CCAAT box in the immediate upstream region from the transcription start sites (Fig.2). The functional role of the 5′-flanking region in the regulation of transcription of the GH receptor gene was assessed by its ability to direct expression of the luciferase gene in a transient transfection assay. A 2.0-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the GH receptor gene, containing 110 bp of exon 1, was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene contained in the promoterless expression vector (pGL3-basic). This fusion construct (pGL3B-L2[−2.0]) exhibited significant luciferase activity when transiently transfected into BNL CL.2 mouse liver cells (Fig.3 A). In multiple transfection experiments, the relative expression of luciferase using pGL3B-L2[−2.0] was consistently about 6–9-fold greater than the background measured with the promoterless vector and approximately equal to that observed with the positive control that contains the cytomegalovirus promoter. Primer extension experiments with RNA isolated from the transfected cells indicated that the transcription start site utilized by the L2 promoter plasmids corresponded to the major start site identified in RNA extracted from whole liver tissue (Fig. 4). Hence, we conclude that the 5′-flanking region of the L2 transcript of the murine GH receptor gene has promoter activity and that expression of the reporter gene was initiated at a site identical to that used by the GH receptor gene in liver tissue.Figure 4Determination of transcription initiation site usage in luciferase expression plasmids. Autoradiograph of the size-fractionated products of a primer extension reaction carried out with primer (GL5) complimentary to the sequence of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) and 40 μg of total RNA from BNL CL.2 cells transfected with either pGL3-Basic (lane A) or pGL3B-L2[−75] (lane B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The size of the specific product (indicated byarrow) was determined by concurrently electrophoresed32P-labeled φX174 HinfI DNA markers and sequencing reactions (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To localize putative cis-acting elements regulating transcription of the GH receptor gene, we engineered progressively shorter fragments of GH receptor 5′-DNA (Fig. 3 A), and the expression of these deletion mutants was examined in BNL CL.2 cells by transient transfection assays. Whereas deletion of approximately 1925 bp did not result in a significant alteration in the expression of the reporter gene, deletion of the next 32 bp resulted in complete abrogation of promoter activity. These results indicate that the sequence between −75 bp and −43 bp upstream of the transcription start site is essential for basal activity of the GH receptor gene. To examine potential cell type specificity of the GH receptor for the L2 transcript, the activities of the various reporter gene constructs were assayed in CV-1 (monkey kidney) (Fig. 3 B) and HRP.1 (trophoblast) (data not shown). The expression profile of these various constructs was similar to that observed in BNL CL.2 cells with the −75 to −43-bp region being necessary for basal activity. However, in CV-1 cells there was also a significant increase in activity from 0.7 kb to −210 bp, indicating the presence of a putative inhibitory regulatory element in this region. These results indicate that the basal promoter regulating expression of the L2 transcript of the GH receptor is active in a wide variety of tissues, a finding consistent with the widespread expression of the L2 transcript in mouse tissues (12Southard J.N. Barrett B.A. Bikbulatova L. Ilkbahar Y. Wu K. Talamantes F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results with the CV-1 cells suggest that distal promoter elements present upstream in the 5′-flanking region of the L2 UTR may play a role in the tissue-specific regulation of expression of the L2 GH receptor transcript. The loss of expression consequent on deletion of the 32-bp region located between −75 and −43 bp upstream of the transcription start site suggested the presence of basal regulatory element(s) within this region. Computer analysis of the sequence of this 32-bp region indicated the presence of a canonical Sp1-binding site within this region (Fig. 2). An oligonucleotide (L2-A) was designed that encompassed the putative Sp1-binding site, and its protein binding activity was tested by EMSA. Addition of nuclear extract from female mouse liver to an aliquot of32P-labeled L2-A resulted in the formation of three protein-DNA complexes we termed C1, C2, and C3 (Fig.5). To determine the sequence specificity of these protein-DNA complexes, competition experiments were performed. Whereas a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled L2-A eliminated the formation of all three DNA-protein complexes, an oligonucleotide with random sequence did not affect the binding even at a 100-fold molar excess. Thus, these results demonstrate that these protein-DNA complexes are sequence-specific. To determine the identity of the proteins(s) binding to this putative regulatory element, we performed competition experiments with an oligonucleotide (Sp1, Santa Cruz Biotech) containing a consensus binding site for the Sp family of proteins. Although the addition of molar excess of an oligonucleotide with consensus binding site for Sp1 abrogated the formation of all three protein-DNA complexes, addition of an oligonucleotide with point mutations in the Sp1-binding site (Sp1-m, Santa Cruz Biotech) failed to abrogate the formation of the three protein-DNA complexes (Fig.6). We next tested the ability of the L2-A sequence to bind recombinant Sp1 protein. EMSA experiments wherein32P-labeled L2-A was incubated with recombinant Sp1 prior to electrophoresis revealed that the L2-A sequence was able to bind Sp1 protein (Fig. 6, lane 5). In cross-competition experiments, unlabeled L2-A was able to abrogate the binding of recombinant Sp1 protein to both 32P-labeled L2-A and to the32P-labeled oligonuc"

Major components of BCR signaling appear to be expressed at normal levels in these mice, implying that PU.1 and Spi-B cooperate in the transcription of additional target genes important for antigen receptor signaling. We used subtractive hybridization to identify novel in vivo PU.1/Spi-B target genes and determined that the expression of a heptahelical receptor, P2Y10, is dramatically reduced inPU.1 +/− Spi-B −/−B-cells. Further analysis shows that P2Y10 expression is restricted to lymphoid cells and parallels that of Spi-B in B-lymphocytes. Lastly, the P2Y10 promoter contains a PU.1/Spi-B binding site functionally required for efficient transcription in B-cells.

Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) due to a cell intrinsic defect (26Scott E.W. Fisher R.C. Olson M.C. Kehrli E.W. Simon M.C. Singh H.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mice with a different targeted allele of PU.1 display a less severe phenotype, but also lack B-cells (28McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M.

Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the dramatic phenotype presented by the PU.1 −/− animals,Spi-B −/− animals are viable and have no defect in B- or T-cell numbers (30Su G.H. Chen H. Muthususamy N. Garrett-Sinha L. Baunuch D. Tenen D.G. Simon M.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7118-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However,Spi-B −/− B-cells exhibit an interesting defect in BCR1 signaling which appears to be due to misexpression of one or more novel signaling molecule(s) (31Garrett-Sinha L. Su G.H. Rao S. Hao Z. Clark M.R. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).PU.1−/− and Spi-B −/− mice present two of the problems commonly observed when analyzing the phenotype of knock-out animals. The PU.1 −/−mice completely lack B-cells, and thus it is impossible to use these animals as a tool for exploring the role of PU.1 in a mature B-cell. In contrast, Spi-B −/− mice may exhibit a mild phenotype because their B-cells express wild-type levels of PU.1 protein, which could compensate for the lack of Spi-B (31Garrett-Sinha L. Su G.H. Rao S. Hao Z. Clark M.R. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To assess functional redundancies of PU.1 and Spi-B, we generatedPU.1 +/− Spi-B −/− mice (31Garrett-Sinha L. Su G.H. Rao S. Hao Z. Clark M.R. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These mice are viable, but unlike thePU.1 +/+ Spi-B −/−animals, they exhibit perturbed B-cell numbers as well as a more severe decrease in BCR mediated signaling. Thus,PU.1 +/− Spi-B −/− mice act as a genetic model which allows us to explore the roles of this subgroup of Ets proteins in B-cell transcription and function.Although a large number of B-cell PU.1/Spi-B target genes have been identified, all major signaling molecules are expressed at normal levels inPU.1 +/− Spi-B −/− mice (31Garrett-Sinha L. Su G.H. Rao S. Hao Z. Clark M.R. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We hoped to identify novel PU.1/Spi-B target genes important for BCR signaling using subtractive hybridization onPU.1 +/− Spi-B −/−B-cells. These mice provided an attractive population to perform the subtraction because they are phenotypically identical toPU.1 +/+ Spi-B +/+ B-cells based on fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis except for the loss of Spi-B and PU.1. One cDNA corresponding to an mRNA underexpressed inPU.1 +/− Spi-B −/−B-cells encodes a lymphoid-restricted, heptahelical receptor (P2Y10) that couples through heterotrimeric G-proteins. The promoter ofP2Y10 contains a functionally important PU.1/Spi-B-binding site critical for its transcriptional activity in B-cells. We, therefore, identify an in vivo PU.1/Spi-B target gene dependent on wild-type levels of PU.1 and Spi-B for its transcription. P2Y10 is unique in the way it was identified and can act as a model for transcriptional regulation by this important group of DNA-binding proteins in B-cells. In addition, P2Y10 provides an intriguing connection between heterotrimeric G-proteins and membrane proximal BCR signaling events.DISCUSSIONPU.1−/− mice fail to develop any mature B-cells (25Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 28McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is no way to assess the role of PU.1 in B-cell function without a conditional mutation in B-lymphocytes (37Lam K.P. Kühn R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar,38Rickert R.C. Roes J. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1317-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To explore the role of PU.1 in mature B-cells, we created a semi-epistatic condition in which B-cells expressed 50% of wild type PU.1 protein levels and lacked Spi-B (PU.1 +/− Spi-B −/−). B-cells fromPU.1 +/− Spi-B −/− mice contained sufficient PU.1 protein to support B-lymphocyte development but insufficient PU.1/Spi-B binding activity for efficient transcription of all target genes.PU.1+/−Spi-B−/− B-cells represent a tractable model system for analysis of these factors in vivo because they are phenotypically normal when unstimulated (31Garrett-Sinha L. Su G.H. Rao S. Hao Z. Clark M.R. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) but display signaling defects upon IgM cross-linking. As such,PU.1 +/− Spi-B −/− andPU.1 +/+ Spi-B +/+ purified B-cells provide attractive substrates for subtractive hybridization, with the only difference in the two populations being disruption of thePU.1 and Spi-B loci. Our data indicate that PU.1 and Spi-B are necessary for efficient transcription of membrane proximal component(s) of the BCR signaling cascade. Importantly, the expression of several presumptive target genes of PU.1 and Spi-B such as mb-1, Btk, Blk, κ, and λ light chains and all known components of BCR signaling appear unaffected by reduced levels of PU.1 and Spi-B (31Garrett-Sinha L. Su G.H. Rao S. Hao Z. Clark M.R. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore,PU.1 +/− Spi-B −/−B-cells could be used to clone novel PU.1/Spi-B targets important for BCR-mediated responses.We show in this report that PU.1 and Spi-B are both necessary for efficient transcription of P2Y10 in B-cells. It is possible that PU.1 and Spi-B also regulate another transcription factor required for the proper expression of P2Y10. However, we have cloned theP2Y10 promoter and demonstrated that it contains a consensus PU.1/Spi-B-binding site important for promoter activity in B-cells. While these data cannot exclude the possibility that PU.1 and Spi-B also regulate additional gene(s) required for P2Y10 expression, our data illustrate that PU.1 and Spi-B directly control P2Y10promoter activity. Other possible low affinity PU.1/Spi-B sites in the proximal P2Y10 promoter (Fig. 7 B) may explain why the single mutation created in our reporter constructs (Fig. 7,A and B) does not completely abolish transcription in transient assays.The importance of PU.1 and Spi-B for P2Y10 transcription is supported by their convergent expression patterns. In B-cells, P2Y10 expression essentially parallels that of Spi-B in that both are preferentially transcribed in immature and mature B-cells, whereas PU.1 is expressed throughout B-cell development. Importantly, one of the two pre-B cell lines producing P2Y10 (38 B9) also expresses low levels of Spi-B (9Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.M. Chen H.M. Simon M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the other pre-B cell line lacks both P2Y10 (70 Z/3) and Spi-B. These data imply that Spi-B is important for P2Y10 expression (Fig. 4 B). However, EMSA shows that PU.1 is the predominant DNA binding activity contained in A20 or primary B-cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 5, B and C). Based on these results and mRNA levels of P2Y10 fromPU.1 +/+ Spi-B −/− andPU.1 +/− Spi-B −/−purified B-cells (Fig. 2), P2Y10 transcription in B-cells is dependent on the combined dosage of PU.1 and Spi-B, although PU.1 is more critical because it is expressed at higher levels than Spi-B. Transient transfection experiments in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts also support a combined role for PU.1 and Spi-B (Fig. 7). Our data are similar to results reported for bHLH proteins of the E2A family where B-cell development is affected (39Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In this situation, combinations of mutations in E2A, E2–2, and HEB revealed that a critical dosage of all three genes is required for efficient B-cell formation and development. However, in our situation the dosage of PU.1 and Spi-B seems to effect the transcription of a specific target gene. One possible reason that P2Y10 transcription depends on adequate levels of PU.1 and Spi-B is that its proximal promoter contains a paucity of binding sites for other known transcription factors (data not shown). PU.1 and Spi-B are likely to be scaffolding proteins which bind DNA elements and create activation complexes that recruit the basal transcriptional machinery to promoters through multiple protein-protein interactions (40Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 41Eichbaum Q. Heney D. Raveh D. Chung M. Davidson M. Epstein J. Ezekowitz R.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When other factors are present, such protein-protein interactions stabilize PU.1 and/or Spi-B binding and low levels of PU.1/Spi-B are sufficient to create effective transcriptional activation complexes. The lack of binding sites for other transcription factors in the P2Y10 promoter could reduce the stability of activation complexes, requiring maximal levels of PU.1 and Spi-B for proper activation.Another explanation for the observed gene dosage effects could be the presence of additional Ets sites outside of the 0.6-kb P2Y10promoter that preferentially bind either PU.1 or Spi-B which are critical for P2Y10 transcription. Functional Ets sites in B-cell promoters or enhancers which selectively bind PU.1 or Spi-B have not been identified thus far. However, an Ets site in the myeloid cell-specific c-fes promoter appears to bind PU.1 at a significantly higher affinity than Spi-B (22Rao S. Matsumura A. Yoon J. Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11115-11125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The loss of PU.1 or Spi-B would selectively reduce P2Y10 transcription through the activity of such DNA elements.The ultimate goal of our studies was to understand how PU.1/Spi-B target genes contribute to the phenotype of mutant mice. ThePU.1 +/− Spi-B −/− B-cell defect is striking: they exhibit poor proliferation in response to antigenic stimulation both in vivo and in vitro, decreased levels of substrate tyrosine phosphorylation, and a blunted calcium response upon IgM cross-linking. The most likely cause of reduced BCR signaling is decreased Syk phosphorylation of its downstream targets such as phospholipase C-γ2 and BLNK (31Garrett-Sinha L. Su G.H. Rao S. Hao Z. Clark M.R. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Could P2Y10 be the in vivo target gene responsible for thePU.1 +/− Spi-B −/− B-cell signaling defect? Classically, membrane proximal BCR signaling events are thought to involve tyrosine phosphorylation, while activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins and calcium fluxes act downstream. Like other heptahelical receptors, P2Y family members couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins (usually Gαq) and eventually lead to PLC activation (45Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Phamacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 541-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent evidence indicates that Btk, a critical tyrosine kinase in BCR signaling and B-cell development (46Khan W.N. Alt F.W. Gerstein R.M. Malynn B.A. Larsson I. Rathbun G. Davidson L. Muller S. Kantor A.B.

Therefore P2Y10 could activate Btk via G-proteins, thereby influencing the tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proximal components of BCR signaling.If P2Y10 does influence BCR signaling, it must become activated by binding its cognate ligand. Unfortunately, the P2Y10 ligand remains unknown, and it may not be the classical ligand for most purinergic receptors: ATP/ADP or UTP/UDP (55Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Dubyak G.R.

Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Once the natural ligand or a chemical agonist of P2Y10 is discovered the role of this receptor in BCR signaling can be directly assessed.This study represents a unique example of gene targeted mice as a model to identify in vivo target genes of two transcription factors which contribute to an observed lymphoid phenotype. P2Y10 appears to be a direct transcriptional target of both PU.1 and Spi-Bin vivo and provides an interesting model of transcriptional activation by this subgroup of Ets proteins. In addition, P2Y10 could have important implications in coupling heterotrimeric G-proteins directly with membrane proximal BCR signaling events. It will be important to explore the transcriptional regulation of P2Y10as well as its effects on antigen receptor signaling in B-cells. B-cell development represents a complex series of steps during which a single, pluripotent stem cell gives rise to a mature B-lymphocyte with rearranged heavy and light chain loci. Transcription factors play a crucial role in this process by regulating gene expression which affects both lineage specification and function (1Desiderio S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 605-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,2Reya T. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ets DNA-binding proteins represent a key family of transcription factors implicated in lymphoid development and activity. Ets proteins consist of monomeric transcription factors which bind the DNA site GGA(A/T) through their Ets domain, a unique winged helix-turn-helix motif (3Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D.

Because of these differences, PU.1 and Spi-B proteins can also bind the non-canonical AGAA (8Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,9Su G.H.

The major crystallin in high molecular mass and insoluble proteins, α-crystallin, has been thought to play a major role in the maintenance of lens transparency (3Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), as manifested by the recent finding that α-crystallin acts like a chaperone in in vitro experiments (4Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of high molecular mass aggregation and insolubilization have not been well established. A reasonable assumption is that these events are related to proteins being in an unstable or not fully folded state, and thus tending to aggregate when their concentrations are high. A study on thermodynamic and kinetic stability may provide a reliable clue. An earlier report indicated that the native α-crystallin is thermally very stable (5Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It does not denature even at 100 °C, but undergoes a thermal transition at 60–65 °C. Later, it was reported that α-crystallin becomes partially unfolded at this temperature (6Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The refolding is irreversible after exposure to the high temperature (6Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,7Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the reversibility of denaturant unfolding of α-crystallin has been reported (8Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19888-19892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic and kinetic stability, however, has not been studied in detail, presumably because of the heterogeneity and oligomeric nature of α-crystallin. In contrast, the monomeric γ-crystallin has been extensively studied (10Rudolph R. Siebendritt R. Nesslauer G. Sharma A.K. Jaenicke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4625-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Siebendritt R. Sharma A.K. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biol. Chem.

Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported a thermodynamic and kinetic study on γF-crystallin (14Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which is the most stable γ-crystallin gene product (15Mandal K. Bose S.K. Chakrabarti B. Siezen R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 832: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Mandal K. Bose S.K. Chakrabarti B. Siezen R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To obtain pure homogeneous α-crystallin, we have cloned human lens αA- and αB-crystallins (17Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which are good models for studying the unfolding and refolding properties of α-crystallin. In addition to the unfolding intermediate, we also need to consider whether α-crystallin has a dissociation intermediate (18Jeanicke R. Rudolph R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 218-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this work, we used the chemical denaturant GdnHCl1 to compare thermodynamic stability between αA- and αB-crystallins and global analysis to obtain the standard free energy, ΔG UH2O. Global analysis uses multiple data sets, such as results from CD and fluorescence measurements, and involves a simultaneous nonlinear analysis to obtain a single set of parameters that satisfy all sets of data (19Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 20Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 487-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Eftink M.R. Shastry M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 258-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Preparation of the recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins was as described in a previous report (17Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). They are present in solution as 600–800-kDa homo-oligomers. We have also reported some of their biochemical and biophysical properties (17Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Sun T.-X. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Sun T.-X. Akhtar N.J. Liang J.J.-N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by absorption based on aromatic amino acid composition (24Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Absorption was measured with a Perkin-Elmer Model Lambda 11 spectrophotometer. The absorption readings at 235 nm were plotted against GdnHCl concentrations. CD spectra were measured with an Aviv Model 60 DS circular dichroism spectrometer. Five scans were recorded, and the averaged spectrum was smoothed by a polynomial-fitting program. The readings at 223 nm were compiled with GdnHCl concentrations. Appropriate base lines were always subtracted from spectra obtained with the corresponding GdnHCl concentrations. Fluorescence was measured with a Shimadzu Model RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer. Trp emission spectra were scanned with an excitation wavelength at 290–295 nm. To avoid the effect of a red shift in the emission maximum by unfolding, emission intensities at 320 or 350 nm were obtained. The fluorescent probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) was used to study the hydrophobicity of the protein molecule (25Andley U.P. Liang J.N. Chakrabarti B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ANS solution (50 μm) was added to α-crystallin solutions with increasing GdnHCl concentrations, which had been incubated overnight to attain equilibrium. The samples were incubated for 30 min before fluorescence measurements. Emission spectra were scanned with an excitation wavelength at 395 nm. Dissociation of the α-crystallin aggregate was studied with FPLC gel filtration and light scattering at 400 nm. α-Crystallin samples incubated for 24 h with increasing GdnHCl concentrations were applied to a Superose-6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system) and eluted with the same GdnHCl buffer. The column was pre-equilibrated with the appropriate GdnHCl solution. Light scattering was measured at a 90° angle with the Shimadzu spectrofluorometer set at 400 nm for both excitation and emission wavelengths. Scattering intensity of the samples with increasing GdnHCl concentrations was plotted against GdnHCl concentration. The folding reactions have been described in several previous publications (26Utiyama H. Baldwin R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Thomson J.A. Shirley B.A. Grimsley G.R. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11614-11620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Matthews C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For oligomeric α-crystallin, the investigation of unfolding needs to consider whether there is a dissociation intermediate in addition to an unfolding intermediate (18Jeanicke R. Rudolph R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 218-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The presence of a dissociation intermediate can be determined by investigating the molecular mass as a function of the denaturant concentration by FPLC gel filtration. In many systems, dissociation of the subunit aggregate usually precedes subunit unfolding. The unfolding transition was monitored by three probes: Trp fluorescence and absorption (local or tertiary structural change) and far-UV CD (secondary structural change). The data sets can be analyzed either individually or simultaneously by global analysis. The simplest model is a two-state transition. This is the simplest case of denaturant-induced unfolding in which the transition is two-state, with rate constants k 1 andk −1 between a native state N and an unfolded state U and an insignificantly low population of intermediate. Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 describe the thermodynamics of this model. KU=[U]/[N]Equation 1 Q=1+KUEquation 2 XN=1/Q;XU=KU/Q=1−XNEquation 3 ΔGU=ΔGUH2O−mD=−RT lnKUEquation 4 K U is the unfolding equilibrium constant;Q is the partition function; and X Nand X U are mole fractions of the proteins in the native and unfolded states, respectively. ΔG Uand ΔG UH2O are the standard free energy changes for the unfolding transition in the presence and absence of denaturant D, and m is the denaturant susceptibility parameter that describes the dependence of ΔG U on denaturant concentration. Substituting Equation 4 for Equations 2 and 3, we get Equations 5 and 6. Q=1+exp(mD−ΔGUH2O)/RTEquation 5 XU=(exp(mD−ΔGUH2O)/RT)/QEquation 6 The observed parameter F[D] at any denaturant concentration [D] is given by Equation 7. F[D]=XNFN+XUFUEquation 7 where F N and F Uare the parameters of the native and unfolded states, respectively. A nonlinear least-squares fitting program will yield the free energy difference in the absence of denaturant (ΔG UH2O) andm. If a detectable intermediate I is involved, then a three-state model with rate constants k 1, k −1,k 2, and k −2 should be applied. The treatment of data and the equations used (Equations Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12, Equation 13) are similar to those of the two-state model. KNI=[I]/[N];KIU=[U]/[I]Equation 8 Q=1+KNI+KIU+KNIKIUEquation 9 XN=1/Q;XI=KNI/Q;XU=KNIKIU/QEquation 10 ΔGNI=ΔGNIH2O−mNID=−RT lnKNIEquation 11 ΔGUI=ΔGIUH2O−mIUD=−RT lnKIUEquation 12 F[D]=XNFN+XIFI+XUFUEquation 13 where F I is the parameter of the intermediate. Similarly, a nonlinear least-squares fitting will yield the free energy differences between the native form and the intermediate (ΔG NIH2O) and between the intermediate and the unfolded form (ΔG IUH2O) as well asm NI and m IU. Global analysis considers all measurement parameters simultaneously; the thermodynamic model is acceptable only if it fits all three spectral signal changes (20Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 487-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Eftink M.R. Shastry M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 258-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A nonlinear least-squares fitting program was written in association with SigmaPlot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The initial parameters were provided, and regression was run until the R or R 2 values were minimal. We sought to establish whether the α-crystallin aggregate (600–800 kDa) dissociates gradually or abruptly with increasing GdnHCl concentrations. Fig. 1 shows the FPLC elution profiles with increasing GdnHCl concentrations. Both αA- and αB-crystallins displayed a sharp peak at 20–22-ml fractions and started dissociating at around 1.0 m GdnHCl. A dissociated intermediate appeared and was in equilibrium with the undissociated multimer and the completely unfolded monomer at 1.0–1.5 mGdnHCl for both αA- and αB-crystallins. The peak position for the undissociated multimer, however, shifted to a position of slightly higher molecular mass. The transition range was narrow and completed at 2.0 m GdnHCl. With heating (6Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), no dissociation intermediate was observed, and the fate of the partially unfolded protein is to undergo high molecular mass aggregation. The scattering data also reflect on the size of aggregates (Fig.2). The transition is apparently two phases involving a stable intermediate. ANS intensity initially increased with increasing GdnHCl concentration, reached a maximum intensity at 0.4 mGdnHCl, and then decreased (Fig. 3). The total loss of binding was achieved at a lower GdnHCl concentration for αB-crystallin than for αA-crystallin. α-Crystallin samples with increasing GdnHCl concentrations were left overnight at room temperature to reach equilibrium. Three spectroscopic measurements were used to probe the unfolding transition: far-UV CD for secondary structure and Trp fluorescence and absorption for tertiary structure. Fig.4 (A and B) shows plots of absorbance at 235 nm, Trp fluorescence intensity at 320 nm, and CD intensity at 223 nm versus GdnHCl concentration. An initial global analysis with the two-state model gave an exceptionally poor fit, and the data were abandoned. A three-state fit is presented in Fig. 4 (A and B) (solid lines), and the resulting ΔG iH2O andm i values are listed in TableI. Thermodynamically, αA-crystallin (ΔGNUH2O = 6.38 kcal/mol) is more stable than αB-crystallin (5.04 kcal/mol), although the difference (1.34 ± 0.705 kcal/mol) is borderline significant. The small difference in m NU (9.92 versus7.29 kcal/mol/mol) between αA- and αB-crystallins apparently indicates that their conformations are similar. Fig.5 (A and B) displays the residuals of the fits, which should be randomly distributed about zero. Apparently, the three-state model is not a perfect fit, but the four-state model is too complicated to analyze, with too many parameters involved.Table IΔGiH2Oand mi values of three-state fits for αA- and αB-crystallinsCrystallinΔG NIH2OΔG IUH2OΔG NUH2Om NIm IUm NUαA2.90 ± 0.503.48 ± 0.836.38 ± 0.672.89 ± 0.183.91 ± 0.459.92 ± 0.32αB1.69 ± 0.113.35 ± 0.335.04 ± 0.224.76 ± 0.392.53 ± 0.207.29 ± 0.30The unit for ΔGiH2O is kcal/mol, and that for m i is kcal/mol/mol.

The reconstituted homopolymeric αA- and αB-crystallins were either smaller than the native protein or not in the native conformation (29Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G.U. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 969-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Wang K. Ma W. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Sharma K.K. Kaur H.

The use of recombinant technology to clone αA- and αB-crystallins has overcome this difficulty and facilitated many kinds of studies (17Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol.

Macromol. 1998; 22: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, interest in α-crystallin has been intensified following many findings: α-crystallin possesses a chaperone-like property (4Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 38Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.-J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); αB-crystallin is a small heat-shock protein expressed in non-lenticular tissues, and its expression increases in some neurological diseases (39Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 40Groenen P.J. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J.

We have reported differences in hydrophobicity, chaperone-like activity, thermal stability, and rate of subunit exchange between αA- and αB-crystallins (17Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Sun T.-X. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Sun T.-X. Akhtar N.J. Liang J.J.-N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The thermal stability study indicated that αB-crystallin is more susceptible to aggregation than αA-crystallin and that addition of αA- to αB-crystallin reduces aggregation (22Sun T.-X. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The lower thermal stability for αB-crystallin at high temperature may be related to its greater hydrophobicity (17Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 42Bloemendal M. Bloemendal H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The present thermodynamic study also indicated that αA-crystallin is conformationally more stable than αB-crystallin. The difference may contribute to the differential susceptibility to modification-related aggregation and insolubilization. We are currently studying the human lens insoluble fraction to see whether it contains equal or different amounts of αA- and αB-crystallins by an immunochemical method. The low conformational stability of either αA- or αB-crystallin may imply that in vivo, α-crystallin is more susceptible to aggregation and insolubilization than other crystallins. Low conformational stability of calf lens α-crystallin was also reported by calorimetric measurement (ΔG UH2O ∼ 6 kcal/mol) (43Gesierich U. Pfeil W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have reported rather high conformational stability for calf lens γF-crystallin (ΔG UH2O ∼ 9 kcal/mol) (14Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin has been suggested to have a stable intermediate (8Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19888-19892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G.U. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 969-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,45Wistow G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 46van den Oetelaar P.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 995: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 47Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An ANS study of calf lens α-crystallin demonstrated that it undergoes partial unfolding in dilute GdnHCl concentrations, and an intermediate was observed at 0.8–1.0 m GdnHCl with maximum hydrophobicity and chaperone-like activity (9Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). None of the earlier reports, however, distinguished the unfolding intermediate from the dissociation intermediate. Our FPLC data indicated that αA- and αB-crystallins started dissociating at 1.0 m GdnHCl. The fractions between 25 and 30 ml contained partially dissociated proteins, whereas the fractions between 35 and 40 ml contained mostly unfolded proteins. The corresponding unfolding curve of the Trp emission maximum shows a gradual shift from 336 to 352 nm (>3.0m GdnHCl), indicating an initial partial unfolding to complete unfolding (data not shown). The fact that dissociation yields only one oligomer with a defined size indicates that the dissociation is a cooperative reaction. A nonspecific dissociation will yield many oligomers with various sizes, resulting in a very broad FPLC peak. The sequence of events appears to be partially unfolding and loosing of the quaternary structure, followed by dissociation and complete unfolding. No three-dimensional x-ray crystal structure is available for α-crystallin, and many structural models have been proposed, including a three-layer model (48Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoender H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 49Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a micellar model (50Augusteyn R.C. Koretz J.F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a chaperone two-stack model (51Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a “pitted-flexiball” model (52Smulders R.H. van Boekel M.A. de Jong W.W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and a model of a spherical assembly with a central cavity (53Haley D.A. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). More recently, a three-dimensional structural model was constructed (54Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) based on the similarity between the sequences of human αB-crystallin and the sHsp Mj HSP 16.5, whose high resolution structure is known (55Muchowski P.J. Wu G. Liang J.J.N. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The building block is a dimer in which the monomer folding unit composes a β-sandwich arrangement: eight β-strands in the core “α-crystallin” (Glu67–Ile161) and one β-strand in the N-terminal domain. Further study is needed to establish whether the building block dimer is the intermediate observed in this study. One analogous system for the unfolding study of α-crystallin is chaperonin-60 (GroEL). GroEL is an oligomer consisting of 14 subunits of 57 kDa each, with a molecular mass close to the 800 kDa of α-crystallin (56Becker J. Craig E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure is two heptameric rings stacked on top of each other to form a cylinder. Each subunit is folded into three functional domains. The unfolding of GroEL had been studied by equilibrium measurements in urea and was completed at 3.1m urea as measured by CD or Trp fluorescence (57Gorovits B.M. Seale J.W. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13928-13933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The free energy ΔG was estimated to be 13 kcal/mol; whereas Mg2+ binding increased the stability, ADP nucleotide binding decreased the stability (44Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that both αA- and αB-crystallins have stable intermediates during the unfolding process and that αA-crystallin is thermodynamically more stable than αB-crystallin. The significance of stable intermediates may be related to their chaperone-like activity; the intermediates show greater activity than the native α-crystallin."

These mutants are called γY207C/cc′Q42C and εE31C/cc′Q42C, respectively. Cross-linking of ε to thec subunit ring was obtained almost to completion without significant effect on any enzyme function, i.e. ATP hydrolysis, ATP synthesis, and ATP hydrolysis-driven proton translocation were all close to that of wild type. The γ subunit could also be linked to the c subunit ring in more than 90% yield, but this affected coupling. Thus, ATP hydrolysis was increased 2.5-fold, ATP synthesis was dramatically decreased, and ATP hydrolysis-driven proton translocation was abolished, as measured by the 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridinequenching method. These results for εE31C/cc′Q42C indicate that the c subunit ring rotates with the central stalk element. That the γ-ε cross-linked enzyme retains ATPase activity also argues for a γε-c subunit rotor. However, the uncoupling induced by cross-linking of γ to the c subunit ring points to important conformational changes taking place in the γε-c subunit interface during this. Blocking these structural changes by cross-linking leads to a proton leak within the F0.

This enzyme can use a proton gradient to synthesize ATP, a process that is reversible in bacteria, where the hydrolysis of ATP is used to generate a proton motive force for substrate and ion transport (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The best-characterized F1F0-type ATP synthase, that fromEscherichia coli, is composed of two parts: a membrane-embedded F0 part containing three different subunits (a, b2, c12) (3Foster D.L.

Rev. 1987; 51: 477-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a water-soluble ECF1 part with five different subunits (α3, β3, γ, δ, ε). The structures of the α and β subunits are known in detail from x-ray crystallography (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The F1 portion contains the three catalytic sites, each predominantly on a β subunit, but with the contribution of residues of the α subunits. Recent electron microscopy studies show that the F1 and F0 parts are connected by two stalks (8Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Böttcher B. Schwarz L. Gräber P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The more central stalk has been shown to include the γ and ε subunits (10Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas the outer stalk is made by theb and δ subunits (12Ogilvie I. Aggeler R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that the central stalk is rotating inside the α-β subunits, with the more peripheral stalk acting to hold the α-β hexagon in position relative to the a subunit (14Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 15Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31765-31969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Various models of the catalytic mechanism have been proposed where the ring of c subunits is a part of the rotor coupling proton translocation across the membrane to conformational changes that lead to the formation of ATP (17Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 18Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the direct evidence that thec subunit ring rotates with the γ-ε subunits is lacking. One approach to establishing that γ, ε, and c subunits work together as the rotor would be to show that cross-linking of these subunits does not block energy-coupling within the complex. A positive result would be strong evidence that the linked subunits move in unison. A negative result would not rule out co-rotation but would require a molecular explanation, which might give important insight into the coupling mechanism. The sites of interaction between γ and ε with the csubunit have been partly mapped by genetic and chemical cross-linking studies. The γ subunit interacts with the polar loop of csubunits via a region including residues Tyr-205, Tyr-207, and Glu-208 (19Watts S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15065-15068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chrm. 1998; 273: 22292-22297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The interaction of the ε subunit with the polar loop ofc subunit is via a loop provided by residues Glu-31 to His-38 (21Hermolin J. Dmitriev O.Y. Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17011-17016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although cross-linking of both γ and ε to thec subunit ring have been obtained already, the effects of these cross-links on function have been hard to assess. Introducing Cys residues into each of the polar loop regions of c causes dimer formation of this subunit, and the effects of these are difficult to differentiate from γ-c or ε-cinteractions. To avoid such problems, we have now generated mutants in which Cys residues are present only in the polar loop of every secondc subunit. This was accomplished by generating subunitc fusions genetically, where the linkage is from the C terminus of the first to the N terminus of the second copy ofc. The mutant is constructed so that a Cys is present only in the second c subunit of each pair. As a result, there is very little cross-linking between c subunits, allowing the functional effects of cross-linking of γ or ε to the csubunit ring to be assessed unambiguously. E. coli strains used wereCJ236 (New England Biolabs) for site-directed mutagenesis according to Kunkel et al. (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to express the mutant ATP synthases. The c subunit dimer was created using a two-stage polymerase chain reaction strategy (26Landt O. Grunert H-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide 5′-CGTGATGTTCGCTGTCGCGGGTACC ACTAGTTAAGCGTTGCTTTTATTTAAAGAGC-3′ incorporates consecutive in-frame KpnI (bold) andSpeI (bold, underlined) restriction enzyme sites at the 3′ end of the uncE (subunit c) gene before the stop codon. This oligonucleotide was used in a polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with an antisense primer (TCTGGCGCAAGCGCGC), which anneals downstream of the uncE region of the wild-type template pRA100 (described in Aggeler et al. (27Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). The purified “megaprimer” product of this reaction was used in a second polymerase chain reaction with a sense primer (CTGTCGGAATGGACGA), which anneals upstream of the uncE region of the template plasmid pRA100. The product, which encodes subunit c with a C-terminal 4-residue GTTS extension, was excised and integrated into the plasmid pRA100 with BssHII/BsrGI, creating the plasmid pJM1. In a separate polymerase chain reaction, sense and antisense oligonucleotides were employed to amplify the uncE region. The sense primer, 5′-CGGGTACC AGTGCTAGCAACGGCGCGAGTAGCGCGATGGAAAACCTGAAT-3′, incorporates a 5′ KpnI restriction site (bold) preceding a 27-base region (italic, underlined) encoding the sequence SASNGASSA, a random sequence predicted to be flexible. The corresponding antisense primer, 5′-TTA ACTAGTCGCGACAGCGAACATC-3′, incorporates a 3′ SpeI restriction site (bold, underlined). Using the plasmid pBS106, which was created by inserting a 7.3-kilobaseBsrGI/NsiI fragment of pYZ215 into pRA100, as template DNA, the amplification product resulted in an uncEregion with the mutation Q42C. This amplification product is inserted into pJM1 using restriction sites KpnI and SpeI, creating pRA197, which encodes two c subunits linked by the 11-residue loop GTSASNGASSA with a cysteine residue in position 42 and threonine-serine at the C terminus of the second c subunit only (cc′Q42C). The double mutant pRA198, containing thec-dimer and a cysteine in position 31 of the ε subunit (cc′Q42C/εE31C), was generated by ligating the 7.2-kilobase XhoI/NsiI fragment of pRA197 with the 5.8-kilobase fragment of pBS106. Mutant pRA230 containing a cysteine in position 207 of the γ subunit (γY207C) was created by site-directed mutagenesis, using the oligonucleotide 5′-GGGATTACCTGTGCGAACCCGATCC-3′, and subcloning of the mutated γ gene into pRA100 was performed as described in Aggeler and Capaldi (28Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21355-21359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pRA214 with thec-dimer and a cysteine in position 207 of the γ subunit (cc′Q42C/γY207C) was obtained from pRA197 and pRA230. Inner membranes were isolated from the strain RA1 (11Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Reconstitution of F1F0 in egg lecithin vesicles and CuCl2-induced cross-linking at 0.5 mg of protein/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol was carried out as described by Aggeler et al.

ATP synthesis was determined with a luciferin/luciferase detection system (Sigma), and NADH and ATP-dependent proton translocation by following the quenching of ACMA1 (Molecular Probes) with an SLM 8000 fluorometer. 2B.

Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS gels containing 10–18% polyacrylamide (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (36Downer N.W. Robinson N.C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) or blotting on nitrocellulose membranes for identification with a pair of monoclonal antibodies against γ and ε subunit, respectively, as described by Mendel-Hartvig and Capaldi (37Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that csubunits of the F0 part of ECF1F0can be linked from the C terminus of one copy to the N terminus of a second copy to form fused dimers (4Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme containing these genetically fused c subunits was shown to retain function. By introducing a Cys residue in the polar loop of only one of the two copies of such a c subunit dimer, we reasoned that it might be possible to prevent the cross-linking between polar loops of near neighbor c subunits, which has been problematic in previous studies that examined the effects of cross-linking γ or ε subunits to the c subunit ring. To this end, the mutant shown in Fig. 1 was constructed. This new mutant contained the c subunit as a dimer connected by a loop of 11 amino acids from the C terminus of the first to the N terminus of the second copy of the subunit. The second csubunit of each pair also had two additional amino acids at its C terminus, as a result of the cloning strategy used. Finally, the polar loop region of the second, but not the first c subunit of the construct, had a Cys replacing the Gln at position 42. If thec subunits were arranged as a ring of 12 (33Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), there would have been 6 Cys residues at alternating positions in the ring in ECF1F0 from this mutant. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the ATPase activity of the inner membranes from the cc′Q42C mutant was approximately one-half that of wild-type cell membranes. ECF1F0 isolated from the mutant had an ATPase activity of 16.5 units/mg compared with around 24 units/mg for wild type, a reduction of around 30%. The lower activity appeared to be in part due to lower levels of assembled enzyme, but as shown by data for the purified enzyme, the mutant also had a lower turnover rate. Enzyme in inner membranes from the mutant cc′Q42C retained a level of DCCD sensitivity of the ATPase activity close to that for wild-type, 70% compared with 80% using 20 μm DCCD. Proton pumping was only marginally affected (compare plot C against plot B of wild type in Fig. 2). In this respect, the dimer construct prepared in this study was different from that described recently by Jones and Fillingame (4Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which had a much reduced proton-pumping function. The efficient coupling of proton translocation to catalytic site activity was further evaluated by ATP synthesis measurements, studies not done by Jones and Fillingame (4Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis activity by the mutant containing the fused c subunit dimer was not measured directly, but even in the mutant with the ε31C, there was no dramatic decrease in ATP synthesis (90% that of wild type). Thus, dimers linked by a loop on the periplasmic side, away from the F1, functioned well in energy coupling within the ECF1F0 complex. As hoped, there was no significant cross-linking between Cys residues in the cc′ subunit ring at levels of Cu2+, which generated high yields of γ-c 2 or ε-c 2 products. At higher Cu2+concentrations, tetramer formation was observed without concomitant loss of activity. To examine the effects of cross-linking of the ε subunit to the c subunit ring, the mutant εE31C/cc′Q42C was constructed. As shown in Fig.3, there was ready disulfide bond formation between ε and the cc′ in this mutant. At 150–200 μm Cu2+, the yield of ε-c 2 cross-linking was 80–90% based on the disappearance of the ε subunit in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels when purified ECF1F0 from the mutant was reacted with Cu2+. A similar yield of cross-linking was calculated in inner membranes after treatment with the same Cu2+ concentration, based on the disappearance of ε subunit when determined by Western blotting. The effects of cross-linking ε to cc′ on functioning of ECF1F0 are summarized in Fig.4. High cross-linking yields had no significant effect on ATP hydrolysis rates or on proton pumping function when measured in the ACMA quenching assay (Fig.4 B). The rate of ATP synthesis was only reduced 30% when 200 μm Cu2+ was used for cross-linking. However, a similar level of inhibition was obtained when wild-type enzyme was treated in the same way. Therefore, this effect could be due to cross-linking of other enzymes in the E. coli membrane that lead to some proton leakage or an effect on ECF1F0 other than cross-linking of ε toc 2. Our previous studies have shown that a Cys at positions 205 or 207 (19Watts S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15065-15068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) can be cross-linked to the polar loop of thec subunit in high yield. The mutant γY205C/cQ42C was examined in detail previously (19Watts S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15065-15068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, the mutant γY207C/cc′Q42C was studied because it grew like wild type on succinate, whereas the γY205C/cc′Q42C mutant did not. As shown in Fig. 5 A, there were significant levels of cross-linking of γ to cc′ in ECF1F0 purified from the mutant at 200 μm Cu2+, but maximal yields required levels up to 1 mm. In membranes, lower levels of Cu2+gave higher levels of γ-c 2 product than in the isolated membrane, based on monoclonal antibody binding in Western blots (Fig. 5 C), but cross-linking was still incomplete at 200 μm. Fig. 5 B shows the effects of the cross-linking on ATPase activity. At 200 μmCu2+, with an approximate 50% yield of cross-link, there was a 170% increase in ATPase activity. At 500 μmCu2+, the activation was over 2-fold. Fig. 5 Ashows that subsequent dithiothreitol treatment failed to break all of the γ-c 2 cross-links or regenerate fully the free γ subunit. This is presumably because of covalent linking of γ to c 2 via the Cys of cc′ and the Tyr at position 205 of γ, based on previous work. Functional studies on E. coli membranes were conducted at 200 μm Cu2+, a concentration at which effects unrelated to cross-linking within ECF1F0 were minimal. The cross-linking of γ to c 2 in membranes led to the same activation of ATPase activity seen with the purified enzyme. Concomitant with this was a major reduction in proton pumping and a 70% reduction in ATP synthesis rates (Fig.6), even though the yield of cross-linked product was maximally 50%. These represent a direct effect of cross-linking of γ to c 2 and not a secondary result of Cu2+ addition, as proton pumping was mostly recovered on addition of dithiothreitol, which breaks disulfide bonds (result not shown). The cross-linking of γY207C or εE31C to cQ42C has been studied before (19Watts S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15065-15068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, functional studies were complicated by the fact that the Cys introduced into the c subunit led to the formation of c dimers in addition to the γ-c or ε-c product being examined. In our previous work (19Watts S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15065-15068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), this dimer formation caused an inhibition of the enzyme function, making interpretation of the effects of cross-linking of the central stalk subunits to the c subunit ring difficult. To avoid this problem , we followed an approach developed by Jones and Fillingame (4Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and created a c dimer in which the two copies were connected by a flexible loop at the periplasmic side. We then introduced 1 cysteine/dimer in the second subunit in the polar loop part at position 42. The effect was to place Cys at alternatec subunits around the ring on the F1-facing side. This proved to eliminate significant cross-linking between adjacent polar loops of the c subunits. Tetramers,i.e. cross-links of two cc′ subunits, were obtained at higher Cu2+ concentrations. As reported by Jones and Fillingame (4Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), E. coli with ECF1F0 in which the c subunit is a dimer instead of monomer, grew well on succinate. With the linkage between the two monomers on the periplasmic side, ECF1F0 retained ATP-coupled proton translocation close to that of wild-type enzyme. In the mutant εE31C/cc′Q42C, there was ready cross-linking of ε to the c subunit ring, an observation first made by Zhang and Fillingame (38Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using a mutant incorporating a Cys at position 31 in ε but with a Cys for Gln-42 in all 12 csubunits. In their studies, they compared enzyme function in membranes of their mutant that had been prepared with and without reducing conditions. This was possible because cross-linking between the Cys at position 31 in ε and a Cys in the polar loop at positions 40, 42, or 43 was formed in significant yield without the addition of Cu2+. Zhang and Fillingame (38Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) report that the yield of cross-linking of ε Cys-31 to c Cys-42 in their studies was 63–78%, based on staining in Western blots, and that this level of cross-linking reduced ATPase activity by around 30% and proton pumping by 50–90%. Based on these findings, they concluded that cross-linking of ε to the c subunits blocks alternation between catalytic sites in F1, with residual ATPase activity reflecting mutationally induced uncoupling of F1 from F0. In their studies, Zhang and Fillingame (38Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) formed significant levels of c dimer due to cross-linking of proximal Cys-42 residues. They argued that c-ccross-linking was not responsible for the observed effects because the ACMA quenching of enzyme in the mutant cQ42C was normal. Here, we examined the effects of cross-linking of a Cys in ε at position 31 and in the c subunit at position 42 in both purified ECF1F0 from the mutant εE31C/cc′Q42C and in inner membranes from this mutant. Cross-linking had essentially no effect on ATPase activity in purified enzyme, where the yield of ε-c 2 cross-linking was very high, and yet generation of cross-linking between polar loops of cc′ subunits was essentially zero. Cross-linking of ε to the cc′ subunit ring also had no significant effect on ATPase activity in inner membranes, and there was little or no effect on proton translocation or ATP synthesis because of covalent linkage of the two subunits. These results are consistent with the csubunit ring and the ε subunit rotating together during coupling of catalytic site events and proton channeling in both ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis. It is interesting to note that the yield of cross-link of the ε to c2 was close to 100% (and that of γ to the c2 subunits greater than 80%), although only 50% of the 12 polar loops of the c subunit ring contain a Cys. The most likely explanation is that the polar loop regions of c are deformable enough that the Cys-42 in two (or more) c2 subunits can reach Cys-31 of ε or Cys-207 of γ. This is supported by the fact that some tetramer formation was observed, requiring significant flexibility of the loop. There is now considerable data to indicate that both γ and ε subunits rotate during functioning of F1F0-type ATPases (14Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31765-31969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The observation that the two can be cross-linked together without effect on ATP hydrolysis or ATP synthesis is strong evidence that the two subunits move together during coupling (25Schulenberg B. Wellmer F. Lill H. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It was surprising, then, to find that cross-linking of γ to thec subunit ring induced an uncoupling of the F1from the F0 part such that ATPase activity was increased by release from constraints of the F0, and that the F0 part became leaky to protons. This leak through the F0 not only affected ATP-driven proton translocation but also NADH-driven proton pumping (see Fig. 6). Accepting that γ, ε, and c subunits all rotate in unison, the data for the mutant γY207C/cc′Q42C are best interpreted as indicating conformational changes of the γ subunit and/or c subunit ring during the rotation that are important for functioning. It is important to note that the mutant functions like wild type in the absence of cross-link formation. Only after disulfide bond formation, which would prohibit the conformational change, was there loss of coupling. It is interesting that the recent model of the csubunit ring provided by Fillingame and co-workers (33Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) has a key residue in the proton-translocating path, Asp-61, pointing away from the surface of the a subunit thought to complete the proton channel. These authors propose that there must be rearrangement of the c subunits as each is brought into interaction with the a subunit during the rotation process. It could be this reorientation of all or a part of the c subunits that is being blocked by the cross-linking described here. Clearly, the γY207C/cc′Q42C mutant will be interesting to study by physical methods such as video microscopy to explore the linkage of rotation of the γ-ε rotor to proton translocation in more detail. In summary, we provide the first strong evidence that the csubunit ring rotates along with the γ−ε rotor, based on results with the mutant εE31C/cc′Q42C. It appears that the rotor is not a rigid entity but undergoes conformational rearrangements transmitted from γ−ε to the c subunits during coupling steps based on studies of the γY207C/cc′Q42C mutant. Such conformational flexibility of the γ−ε to the c subunit ring interface was already apparent in previous cross-linking studies in that a Cys at position 31 of ε readily cross links at several sites on the polar loop of c and that a Cys at 205 of γ can link to several positions on this loop of the csubunit. We thank Kathy Chicas-Cruz and Beth Monika for their help in making enzyme preparations. The plasmid pYZ215 was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Fillingame."
https://openalex.org/W1997226028,"Serpins represent a diverse class of endogenous protease inhibitors that regulate important biological functions. In consideration of the importance of regulated proteolysis within secretory vesicles for the production of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters, this study revealed the molecular identity of a novel serpin, endopin 1, that is localized to neurosecretory vesicles of neuropeptide-containing chromaffin cells (chromaffin granules). Endopin 1 of 68–70 kDa was present within isolated chromaffin granules. Stimulated cosecretion of endopin 1 with chromaffin granule components, [Met]enkephalin and a cysteine protease known as ""prohormone thiol protease,"" demonstrated localization of endopin 1 to functional secretory vesicles. Punctate, discrete immunofluorescence cellular localization of endopin 1 in chromaffin cells was consistent with its secretory vesicle localization. Endopin 1 contains a unique reactive site loop with Arg as the predicted P1 residue, suggesting inhibition of basic residue-cleaving proteases; indeed, trypsin was potently inhibited (<i>K</i> <sub>i</sub><sub>(app)</sub> of 5 nm), and plasmin was moderately inhibited. Although endopin 1 possesses homology with α<sub>1</sub>-antichymotrypsin, chymotrypsin was not inhibited. Moreover, endopin 1 inhibited the chromaffin granule prohormone thiol protease (involved in proenkephalin processing). These results suggest a role for the novel serpin, endopin 1, in regulating basic residue-cleaving proteases within neurosecretory vesicles of chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1991497157,"Eight genes (atpI, atpB,atpE 1, atpE 2,atpE 3, atpF, atpH, andatpA) upstream of and contiguous with the previously described genes atpG, atpD, andatpC were cloned from chromosomal DNA ofAcetobacterium woodii. Northern blot analysis revealed that the eleven atp genes are transcribed as a polycistronic message. The atp operon encodes the Na+-F1F0-ATPase of A. woodii, as evident from a comparison of the biochemically derived N termini of the subunits with the amino acid sequences deduced from the DNA sequences. The molecular analysis revealed that all of the F1F0-encoding genes from Escherichia coli have homologs in the Na+-F1F0-ATPase operon fromA. woodii, despite the fact that only six subunits were found in previous preparations of the enzyme from A. woodii. These results unequivocally prove that the Na+-ATPase from A. woodii is an enzyme of the F1F0 class. Most interestingly, the gene encoding the proteolipid underwent quadruplication. Two gene copies (atpE 2 and atpE 3) encode identical 8-kDa proteolipids. Two additional gene copies were fused to form the atpE 1 gene. Heterologous expression experiments as well as immunolabeling studies with native membranes revealed that atpE 1 encodes a duplicated 18-kDa proteolipid.

Gottschalk G. Drake H.L. Acetogenesis. Chapman & Hall, New York1994: 127-156Crossref Google Scholar). The sodium ion potential is established by a yet not identified primary pump, connected to the acetyl-CoA pathway (2Heise R. Müller V. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5473-5478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Heise R. Müller V. Gottschalk G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 261-268Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The Δμ̃Na+1established is used as driving force for flagellar rotation as well as ATP synthesis (3Heise R. Müller V. Gottschalk G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 261-268Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 4Heise R. Reidlinger J. Müller V. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Heise R.

The enzyme responsible for Δμ̃Na+-driven ATP synthesis was purified and characterized as a Na+-translocating enzyme (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was characterized by immunological methods, inhibitor studies, and by the molecular analysis of the genes encoding subunits γ, β, and ε as a Na+-F1F0-ATPase (8Forster A. Daniel R. Müller V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Reidlinger J. Mayer F. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Spruth M. Reidlinger J. Müller V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 96-102Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A gene encoding subunit c was cloned, and the sequence analysis together with biochemical studies revealed residues potentially involved in Na+ liganding in the proteolipid (11Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, there are only two thoroughly studied examples in this class of Na+-F1F0-ATPases, the enzymes fromPropionigenium modestum (12Dimroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 11-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and A. woodii. Interestingly, the purified Na+-F1F0-ATPase of A. woodii contained only six polypeptides (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Five were identified as subunits α, β, γ, ε, and c, respectively. Because all bacterial ATPases known to date contain eight non-identical subunits, two subunits (including at least one of the membrane-bound subunits a and b) were apparently missing in the purified enzyme. Nevertheless, the purified enzyme was capable of coupling ATP hydrolysis to Na+ transport. A simpler architecture was also postulated for some F1F0-ATPases from phylogenetically related clostridia (13Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Das A. Ivey D.M. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Clarke D.J. Fuller F.M. Morris J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 597-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether the ATPase from A. woodii does indeed contain less subunits than the enzyme from Escherichia coli, an alternative way was chosen. To delineate the subunit composition of the enzyme, we chose a molecular approach taking advantage of the fact that (most) bacterial F1F0-ATPase encoding genes are organized in operons (16Futai M. Park M.Y. Iwamoto A. Omote H. Maeda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a DNA region containing eight genes (atpI, atpB, atpE 1,atpE 2, atpE 3,atpF, atpH, and atpA) upstream of and contiguous with the previously described genes atpG,atpD, and atpC. All chemicals used were reagent grade and purchased from Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany. [35S]Methionine was from Hartmann Analytik, Braunschweig, Germany. Antibodies were prepared by Bioscience, Göttingen, Germany. A. woodii (DSMZ 1030) was obtained from the “Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen” (DSMZ), Braunschweig, Germany, and grown under strictly anaerobic conditions on carbonate-buffered medium supplemented with 0.4% glycine (17Tschech A. Pfennig N. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 137: 163-167Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (Φ80lacZΔM15) hsdr17recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi1relA1 (18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8090) Google Scholar)) was grown on Luria broth at 37 °C, E. coli DK6 (F−, Strr, hsdR,minA, minB, purE, pdxC,his, ilv, metΔ(uncB-uncC) (19Klionsky D.J. William S.A. Brusilow A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) at 30 °C on Luria broth plus 1% glucose. Plasmids used were pBluescript SK and KS (Stratagene), pACYC184 (20Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pHSG398 and pHSG399 (21Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and pMalc2X (New England Biolabs). Chromosomal DNA of A. woodii was isolated by a modified Marmur preparation as described before (11Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8934) Google Scholar), restricted, size-fractionated by gradient centrifugation, and cloned into pBluescript SK or pACYC184. All procedures used were standard techniques (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc. GmbH, Eggenstein, Germany. DNA sequence was determined by the chain termination method of Sanger (24Sanger F.S. Nickelen F. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52200) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a VAX computer using the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package, Version 8.1 (University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI). Cloning of pAF1 and pSR4 was described before (8Forster A. Daniel R. Müller V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 2.7-kbpBglII/HindIII fragment from pSR4 that hybridized with a 1.9-kbp EcolI/HindIII fragment was cloned into BamHI/HindIII restricted pACYC184 (pSR184BHV). The cloning of the 5′-terminal region of theatp operon was not possible by conventional methods. However, from Southern blots the presence of a SmaI site ≈1600 bp upstream of atpE 1 was evident. A degenerated primer carrying the SmaI restriction site (OSmaV, 5′-TT(GT)(GT)(GT)(GT)(GT)CCCGGG-3′) and a homologous primer (OAwar, 5′-TCCATCGCCCCAGAAATAAA-3′) derived from the 3′-terminal end of the atpB gene were used to amplify by PCR the 5′-terminal region of the atp operon. The resulting 1.6-kbp fragment was cloned into EcoRV restricted pACYC184 and designated pSREVB. After DNA sequencing, PCR was used to verify that this fragment is present as such on the chromosome (data not shown). For RNA isolation, cells were harvested in the logarithmic growth phase and immediately used or frozen at −70 °C. RNA isolation was done with the “RNeasyTMTotal RNA Kit,” Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, as described by the manufacturer. pSR184BHV was restricted withEcoRV, and atpE 1,atpE 2, and atpE 3 were cloned into EcoRV restricted pHSG399 (pSR7v).atpE 1 derived by PCR was cloned into pHSG398 (pSRc1v). A 10-bp XhoI linker (CCCTCGAGGG) was inserted into the unique Eco47III site within atpE 1of pSRc1v, resulting in pSRc1vX. Plasmids were transformed intoE. coli DK6, and minicells were isolated essentially as described (25Homma M. Kutsukake K. Iino T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 464-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene expression was induced by IPTG. Two identical minicell preparations were pooled, pelleted, and resuspended in buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm EDTA, 15% sucrose, and 0.3 mg of lysozyme/ml. After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in ice-cold H2O. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant containing cytoplasm and periplasm was removed, and the membranes were washed twice. SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and autoradiography was as described (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 369-379Crossref Scopus (10399) Google Scholar, 27Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Base pairs 154 to 212 ofatpE 1 (named atpE 1*) were amplified from chromosomal DNA of A. woodii by PCR using two oligonucleotides which introduced EcoRI and PstI sites, respectively (PatpE1-3, 5′-ATCGGACAGGAATTCGCGGCC-3′; PatpE1-4, 5′-TGCTCCTAGCTGCAGAATCAT-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned in pMalc2X, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5α. Cultures were grown in Luria broth at 37 °C, and expression was induced at an A 600 of 0.5 by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. After 2 h of growth, cells were harvested, washed, and disrupted at high pressure in a French press. Further purification of the fusion protein was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. For immunization of a rabbit, the entire fusion protein was used. Cytoplasm and washed membranes of A. woodii were prepared as described previously (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-PAGE (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 369-379Crossref Scopus (10399) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were blocked for 1 h, washed three times with PBST (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 6.4 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 0.05% Tween 20) for 10 min, and incubated with antisera (4 μg of protein/ml of PBST) for 12 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed again three times with PBST (30 min) and then incubated for 1 h with protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. After three further washing steps (10 min), luminescence was detected using the chemiluminescence blotting substrate from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). Previously, an EcoRI fragment containing the 3′ end of atpA, the complete atpG, atpD, and atpC genes, as well as the downstream intergenic region, and a following partial open reading frame encoding AlgD was cloned and sequenced (8Forster A. Daniel R. Müller V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have now cloned the DNA region upstream of thisEcoRI fragment on a series of overlapping clones (see “Experimental Procedures”). DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of eight genes which, based on data base searches, primary sequence alignments, secondary structure predictions, and by comparisons with the experimentally derived N termini of the subunits of the purified protein, encode the previously purified and characterized Na+-F1F0-ATPase (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These genes are organized in the order atpI,atpB, atpE 1,atpE 2, atpE 3,atpF, atpH, and atpA (Fig.1). A strong transcriptional terminator downstream of atpC has been described before (8Forster A. Daniel R. Müller V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether these genes are organized in an operon, RNA was isolated from fructose-grown cells and probed with a 1.9-kb fragment covering atpE 1-atpA. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the probe hybridized to a fragment of ≈10 kb. Because the deduced size of theatpI-atpC transcript is 8.035 kb, this experiment gives evidence that atpI through atpC are transcribed, together with non-coding regions upstream and downstream, as one message.Figure 2Northern blot of A. woodiimRNA probed withatpE 1-atpA.RNA was isolated as described and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was blotted and hybridized with a fragment covering atpE 1-atpA (A). RNA was visualized by UV light after ethidium bromide staining (B). Ethidium bromide was added to only one aliquot of the RNA preparation (lane 2) and the RNA standard (lane 3), but not to the sample in lane 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The genes atpI, atpB,atpE 1, atpE 2,atpE 3, atpF, and atpH are predicted to start with an ATG codon, but atpA starts with the rare codon TTG.

It is very hydrophobic with two predicted transmembrane spans. 26, 36, and 20% of its residues are identical in AtpI from P. modestum (28Krumholz L.R. Esser U. Simoni R.D. FEMS Microbiol.

Subunit a is essential for Na+transport across the membrane, and its structure and function in Na+ transport is described elsewhere (33Rahlfs S. Müller V.

To exclude any cloning artifacts, different primers were derived from the DNA sequence obtained and used to amplify this region from chromosomal DNA. All controls revealed that there are indeed three copies ofatpE present on the chromosome (data not shown). Because this finding is very unusual it is analyzed in more detail below. atpF codes for a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 20.8 kDa. It has a hydrophobic N terminus. The hydrophilic domain is largely α helical, as revealed by secondary structure predictions. 24, 22, and 28% of its residues are identical in subunitb of P. modestum (30Esser U. Krumholz L.R.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, indicating that AtpF is the homolog of subunit b. The similarities are 37, 36, and 42%, respectively. AtpF was not detected in the purified enzyme (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The deduced N-terminal sequence of AtpH is identical to the biochemically derived N-terminal sequence (XLVASKYA) of the 19-kDa subunit of the purified enzyme (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The deduced molecular mass of 20.68 kDa fits well to the experimentally derived value. 29, 22, and 23% of its residues are identical in subunit δ of P. modestum(28Krumholz L.R. Esser U. Simoni R.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 91: 37-41Crossref Google Scholar, 34Kaim G. Ludwig W. Dimroth P. Schleifer K.H. Eur. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, indicating that the 19-kDa subunit is the homolog of subunit δ. The deduced N-terminal sequence of AtpA is identical to the biochemically derived N-terminal sequence (XNL-PEEI) of the 57-kDa subunit of the purified enzyme, which was shown by immunological methods to be the homolog of subunit α (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This is supported by the molecular data: 53, 60, and 61% of its residues are identical in subunit α of E. coli (29Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), P. modestum (28Krumholz L.R. Esser U. Simoni R.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 91: 37-41Crossref Google Scholar,34Kaim G. Ludwig W. Dimroth P. Schleifer K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and M. thermoacetica (13Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The deduced molecular mass of AtpA (54.82 kDa) corresponds well to the experimentally derived value. The most unusual property which is without precedence in any bacterial species was the finding of three proteolipid-encoding genes (atpE 1,atpE 2, atpE 3) in the F1F0-ATPase operon. The DNA sequences ofatpE 2 and atpE 3 are nearly identical. Both have 246 base pairs, and only 18 substitutions occurred on the DNA level. The amino acid sequence of the deduced polypeptides is 100% identical, the deduced molecular mass is 8.18 kDa. 69, 42, and 40% of the residues are identical in subunitc of P. modestum, E. coli, andM. thermoacetica, respectively (Fig.3). The deduced N-terminal sequence matches exactly the biochemically derived sequence (XE(I)LDF(I)K) of the proteolipid detected in the purified enzyme (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The structure and function of AtpE2/AtpE3 and the role of Pro-25, Gln-29, Glu-62, and Thr-63 in Na+ transport have been discussed elsewhere (11Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the previously published sequence was erroneous which led to a protein extended C-terminally by seven residues. Most interestingly, atpE 1 has 546 base pairs, and repeated sequencing did not reveal a stop codon within the sequence of atpE 1. It is more than double the size ofatpE 2/atpE 3. The first and second halves are 66% identical on the DNA level, indicating a duplication and subsequent fusion of a precursor gene. The deduced molecular mass of AtpE1 is 18.37 kDa with four predicted transmembrane helices arranged in two hairpins. Only 60% of the residues of hairpins 1 and 2 are identical. 70 and 72% of the residues of hairpins 1 and 2, respectively, are identical in AtpE2/AtpE3. However, the membrane-buried Na+-translocating residue (Glu-62 in AtpE2/AtpE3), which is also conserved in H+-F1F0-ATPases (35Fillingame R.H. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Valiyaveetil F.I. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is substituted by a glutamine residue in hairpin 2 (Fig. 3). Apart from Glu-62, the residues Pro-25, Gln-29, and Thr-63 have been proposed to be involved in Na+ binding in AtpE2/AtpE3 (11Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); these three residues are conserved in both hairpins. Interestingly, from the multiple alignment it is evident that AtpE1 contains an enlarged N terminus of 17 residues which is not present in AtpE2/AtpE3(Fig. 3). Although the duplicated proteolipid-encoding gene suggested the presence of a duplicated proteolipid, posttranscriptional modifications had to be excluded. Therefore, atpE 1, atpE 2, and atpE 3 were cloned into an appropriate vector (pHSG399) and expressed in minicells of the ATPase-negative mutantE. coli DK6 in the presence of [35S]methionine (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cell-free extract was separated into membranes and cytoplasm and was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To determine whether the separation of cytoplasm and membranes was successful, the cellular localization of the β-lactamase, expressed from pBluescript SK, was analyzed. Pre-β-lactamase and β-lactamase were found predominantly in the membrane fraction and the soluble fraction (containing both cytoplasm and periplasm), respectively, as expected (Fig.4). WhenatpE 1, atpE 2, andatpE 3 were expressed, two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 7 and 16 kDa were detected. These proteins were not present in the vector control. The experimentally determined molecular mass of 7 kDa corresponds well to the deduced masses of AtpE2/AtpE3, and the experimentally determined molecular mass of 16 kDa corresponds well to the deduced molecular mass of the duplicated proteolipid, AtpE1. The proteolipids AtpE1 and AtpE2/AtpE3 were found exclusively in the membrane fraction. Because it is known that the proteolipid from A. woodiiforms very stable oligomers which are even resistant to boiling in SDS-containing buffer, it had to be excluded that the 16-kDa polypeptide is a dimer of AtpE2/AtpE3. Therefore, atpE 1 was cloned separately and, in addition, a frameshift giving rise to a truncated AtpE1 was introduced by cloning a linker into the coding sequence. WhenatpE 1 was expressed, only the 16-kDa protein was detected, which again was exclusively found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4). However, in the construct containing the linker, the 16-kDa protein was no longer present but a 9-kDa polypeptide was found instead in the membranes; the molecular mass of this protein corresponds well to the deduced mass of the truncated protein. These experiments clearly demonstrate that atpE 1 codes for a duplicated proteolipid with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa, which is, at least in E. coli, not converted into two 8-kDa proteolipids. Furthermore, the proteolipid from the Gram-positive A. woodii is targeted to the membrane of the Gram-negative host. To exclude a hypothetical, A. woodii-specific modification system not present in E. coli, the presence in A. woodii of the duplicated proteolipid, AtpE1, had to be verified. Therefore, an immunological approach was chosen. To generate an antiserum, atpE 1 was cloned into various vectors and expressed in E. coli as such or as fusion protein. However, overexpression could never be detected; instead, upon induction of transcription growth of the host cells stopped immediately, and the cells lysed. To circumvent this problem, only base pairs 154–212 (named atpE 1*) were fused tomalE. This construct was overexpressed in E. coliin high yields. Control experiments revealed that there is no MalE homolog in A. woodii (data not shown) and, therefore, the entire fusion protein was purified and used to immunize rabbits. For the immunological detection of AtpE1, A. woodiiwas grown on fructose up to logarithmic growth phase, harvested, and separated into cytoplasm and membranes. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was probed with an anti-AtpE1* antibody. As can be seen in Fig.5, the duplicated proteolipid (AtpE1) was unequivocally present in the membrane fraction. The migration behavior of native AtpE1 was identical to the heterologously expressed protein, and there was no indication for smaller forms of AtpE1. The heterologous expression experiments together with the Western blots exclude a posttranslational splitting of AtpE1 into two 8-kDa proteolipids but gave clear evidence for a duplicated proteolipid in A. woodii, the first ever found to be encoded by an F1F0-ATPase operon. From the data presented here and elsewhere (8Forster A. Daniel R. Müller V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it is evident that the Na+-F1F0-ATPase operon ofA. woodii contains eleven genes. All the genes found in other bacterial species (37Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) have homologs in A. woodii, and the overall genetic organization in the operons is the same. However, only six polypeptides were previously found in the purified enzyme (7Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). From the biochemically derived N-terminal sequences of the polypeptides and the deduced sequences, it is now possible to clearly establish the gene-polypeptide correspondence of the purified Na+-ATPase from A. woodii (Table III). From this comparison, it is obvious that previous enzyme preparations lacked the duplicated proteolipid (AtpE1) as well as subunit a (AtpB) and subunit b (AtpF). The same was observed in M. thermoacetica and Moorella thermoautotrophica. Although the encoding genes were present in the atp operon from M. thermoacetica, subunita and subunit b were not found in purified enzymes (13Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Das A. Ivey D.M. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, antisera against synthetic polypeptides derived from the sequences of subunit a and b ofM. thermoacetica did not cross-react with cell free extract of the same organism (13Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since atpB and atpFwere transcribed, it was concluded that the messages are not translated in M. thermoacetica. Whether this is also true for A. woodii or whether the subunits a and b were simply lost during the purification procedure remains to be determined. The subunit composition of the enzyme from A. woodii is currently under reinvestigation.Table IIIGene-polypeptide correspondence of the Na+-F1F0-ATPase of A. woodiiGene products and ATPase subunits3-aThe sequences deduced from the DNA sequences are shown above the experimentally derived N-termini of the polypeptides found in the purified enzyme.

Open table in a new tab One of the most striking and unique features of the atpoperon of A. woodii is the presence of multiple copies of proteolipid-encoding genes. Multiplication of proteolipid-encoding genes have been found before only in V1V0-ATPases from Eucarya (38Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 39Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol.

Biomembr. 1999; 31: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). What could be the selective pressure for multiplication of proteolipid-encoding genes? One has to keep in mind that the subunits of the ATPase are present in different amounts (a1b2c12δα3γβ3ε), and the proteolipid (subunit c) has by far the highest copy number in the complex. Most of our knowledge concerning the regulation of the synthesis of the proteolipid is derived from the paradigmE. coli. There, the proteolipid-encoding gene is part of a polycistronic message, and enhanced synthesis of the polypeptide is achieved by enhancement of translation. In addition, but to a lesser extent, regulation of the mRNA stability contributes to differential gene expression (42McCarthy J.E. Schairer H.U. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43McCarthy J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, an enhancer could not be identified in any of the atpE genes of A. woodii. What other mechanisms could lead to the high copy number of the proteolipid? First, the proteolipid-encoding gene could be part of the polycistronic message but is transcribed, in addition, also separately from its own promoter. This is apparently encountered in the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei (44Ruppert C. Wimmers S. Lemker T. Müller V. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3448-3452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a mechanism appears to be unlikely in A. woodii, judged from the Northern blots presented here. Second, multiplication of the gene and embedding the copies into the operon would be another way to increase the proteolipid message. This strategy is apparently realized by A. woodii. Another striking and unique feature is the finding in a F1F0-ATPase operon of a gene encoding a duplicated proteolipid. This is without precedence in bacteria. Duplicated proteolipids were, for a long time, seen as an exclusive feature of eucaryal V1V0-ATPases (45Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In archaea, duplication and triplication of proteolipid-encoding genes with subsequent fusion of the genes was described very recently (41Müller V. Ruppert C. Lemker T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,46Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25281-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With the experiments described here we add another argument, now derived from a bacterial species, that multiplied and fused proteolipid-encoding genes are not exclusively present inEucarya, but also in the other domains of life. This does not necessarily argue against the commonly favored view of evolution of ATPases but could result from horizontal gene transfer which is very often underestimated in natural systems. It remains to be established whether the duplicated proteolipid is assembled into the enzyme. This question is very crucial in view of the substitution of the membrane-buried carboxylate in hairpin 1 by a glutamine residue. However, it should be noted that the glutamine is capable to ligand Na+, the physiological coupling ion inA. woodii. The assembly and oligomeric structure of the proteolipid oligomer of A. woodii is currently under investigation. We are indebted to Dr. G. Gottschalk, Göttingen, Germany, for generous support."
https://openalex.org/W2051351017,"Insulin acutely up-regulates p85alpha phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85alphaPI 3-K) mRNA levels in human skeletal muscle (Laville, M., Auboeuf, D., Khalfallah, Y., Vega, N., Riou, J. P., and Vidal, H. (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 98, 43-49). In the present work, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism of action of insulin in primary cultures of human muscle cells. Insulin (10(-7) M, 6 h of incubation) induced a 2-fold increase in p85alphaPI 3-K mRNA abundances (118 +/- 12 versus 233 +/- 35 amol/microgram total RNA, n = 5, p < 0.01) without changing the expression levels of insulin receptor, IRS-1, glycogen synthase, and Glut 4 mRNAs in differentiated myotubes from healthy subjects. The effect is most probably due to a transcriptional activation of the p85alphaPI 3-K gene because the half-life of the mRNA was not affected by insulin treatment (4.0 +/- 0.8 versus 3.1 +/- 0.4 h). PD98059 (50 microM) did not modify the insulin response but increased p85alphaPI 3-K mRNA levels in the absence of insulin, suggesting that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway exerts a negative effect on p85alphaPI 3-K mRNA expression in the absence of the hormone. On the other hand, the insulin effect was totally abolished by LY294002 (10 microM) and rapamycin (50 nM). In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active protein kinase B increased p85alphaPI 3-K mRNA levels. These results indicate that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB/p70S6 kinase pathway is required for the stimulation by insulin of p85alphaPI 3-K gene expression in human muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2095036416,"The refolding and unfolding kinetics of the all-β-sheet protein human basic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-2) were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The kinetics of the unfolding transition are monophasic. The refolding reaction at high and low guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) concentrations is best described by mono- and biphasic folding, respectively. Refolding and unfolding of hFGF-2 (155 amino acids) is very slow compared with other non-disulfide-bonded monomeric proteins of similar size. For example, the rate constant for unfolding at 4.5 mol·liter−1GdmCl is 0.006 s−1, and the refolding rate constants at 0.4 mol·liter−1 GdmCl are 0.01 s−1 and 0.0009 s−1 (15 °C, pH 7.0). A characterization of the thermodynamic nature of the folding process using transition state theory revealed that the slow refolding is almost exclusively controlled by entropic factors, namely the strong loss of conformational freedom during refolding. The rate of the slow unfolding kinetics is mainly (and at low denaturant concentrations exclusively) controlled by the large positive change in enthalpy. hFGF-2 shows similar slow folding kinetics to that of its structural homolog interleukin-1β. Since both proteins show very little sequence identity, it is suggested that their slow folding kinetics are determined by the complex β-sheet arrangement of the native molecules.

The molecular origin of the slow folding kinetics of interleukin-1β has not yet been identified and, despite the presence of a cis proline in the native protein, could not be attributed to prolyl isomerization processes (8Craig S.

However, the stabilization of the three-dimensional structure of the protein with the establishment of native hydrogen bonds began only after 1 s with the protein passing through several folding intermediates containing an increasing content of stable hydrogen bonds within the β-sheets of the three topological units (9Varley P.

Experimental results from folding studies using pulse-labeling hydrogen exchange and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry suggested that the folding of interleukin-1β proceeds through an obligatory, defined intermediate on the folding pathway (10Heidary D.K.

The final stabilization of the native structure of interleukin-1β was observed on a time scale of minutes and could be monitored by tryptophan fluorescence emission spectroscopy (8Craig S.

Cousens L.S. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3441-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The tryptophan is partly exposed to the solvent and localized at the end of a very tight loop connecting two anti-parallel β-strands (3Eriksson A.E. Cousens L.S. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3441-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Eriksson A.E. Cousens L.S. Matthews B.W.

In contrast to interleukin-1β, the fluorescence emission of the single tryptophan present in hFGF-2 is completely quenched in the native molecule (13Estapé D. van den Heuvel J. Rinas U. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unfolding of hFGF-2 leads to a tryptophan-dominated fluorescence spectrum with an increase in the intensity of the emission and an accompanying shift of the maximum wavelength from 306 to 355 nm. The unusual total quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence in hFGF-2 is also abolished in response to marginal perturbations within the native structure of hFGF-2. Therefore, the disappearance of the tryptophan emission during refolding of hFGF-2 can be used as a sensitive probe for the attainment of the correct interactions within the complex β-sheet arrangement of the native molecule.In this study, we describe the refolding and unfolding kinetics of hFGF-2 at different temperatures and varying concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) using fluorescence emission spectroscopy. In addition, we have characterized the thermodynamics of the unfolding and refolding process using transition state theory.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONhFGF-2 is a very unstable protein and exhibits a strong tendency toward aggregation during refolding (13Estapé D. van den Heuvel J. Rinas U. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it can be reversibly unfolded by urea or GdmCl at low protein concentrations (0.5 μmol·liter−1 ≅ 9 μg·ml−1) and in the presence of reducing agents.Kinetics of Unfolding and RefoldingThe results of typical unfolding and refolding kinetics of hFGF-2 as determined by fluorescence spectroscopy and using a manual mixing technique are shown in Fig. 1. The unfolding reaction of hFGF-2 is described by a simple single exponential decay at all GdmCl concentrations investigated (e.g. Fig. 1 A). The refolding kinetics at intermediate GdmCl concentrations are best described by monophasic folding (Fig. 1 B). At low GdmCl concentrations the refolding can be described by a biphasic reaction, and the rate constants for both phases can be determined with sufficient accuracy (Fig. 1 C).The GdmCl-dependent rate constants of refolding and unfolding of hFGF-2 display the typical V-shaped dependence on the denaturant concentration with a minimum in the transition region (Fig.2) as has been reported for numerous other proteins (e.g. Refs. 7Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Company, New York1992: 197-241Google Scholar and 16Matthews C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). At low denaturant concentrations, refolding displays a biphasic behavior. At higher GdmCl concentrations, both phases approach each other and refolding can be described by an apparent monophasic behavior. This monophasic folding and the faster phase in the case of biphasic folding are in the following referred to as the major phase of refolding. Refolding of hFGF-2 is an extremely slow process, e.g. the rate constants of the major and the very slow phase of refolding at 15 °C and 0.4 mol·liter−1 GdmCl correspond tok f1 = 0.01 s−1 andk f2 = 0.0009 s−1, respectively (Fig. 2).Figure 2Determination of the GdmCl-dependent rate constants of refolding (triangles and diamonds correspond to the bi- and monophasic refolding region, respectively) and unfolding of hFGF-2 (circles). Refolding and unfolding experiments were performed at 15 °C at a protein concentration of 0.5 μmol·liter−1 in 0.1 mol·liter−1sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mol·liter−1 BME, and varying concentrations of denaturant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Unfolding of hFGF-2 is monophasic at all denaturant concentrations. Also, the slope of the GdmCl dependence of the lnk uis linear, indicating monophasic unfolding. The unfolding of the growth factor is also a very slow process, e.g. the rate constant of unfolding at 15 °C and 4.5 mol·liter−1 GdmCl corresponds to k u = 0.006 s−1 (Fig.2).The amplitude associated with the major phase of refolding represents 75–85% of the total amplitude observed at low GdmCl concentrations and decreases with increasing denaturant concentrations (data not shown). The amplitude or in the case of biphasic folding the sum of the two amplitudes associated with the refolding and unfolding transitions correspond to the entire amplitude expected from equilibrium unfolding experiments. This shows that the very fast and early phases of refolding that cannot be resolved by using manual mixing techniques are not associated with any or only with an insignificant change in tryptophan emission.Temperature Dependence of Unfolding Kinetics and Kinetics of the Major Refolding PhaseThe GdmCl-dependent refolding and unfolding kinetics of hFGF-2 were studied at temperatures ranging from 15 to 35 °C (Fig. 3). The unfolding rate constant shows a strong dependence on the denaturant concentration and is also affected considerably by the temperature. Unfolding of hFGF-2 is slow at all the temperatures studied. The slopes of the denaturant dependence of lnk u at a given temperature are linear at all temperatures investigated indicating monophasic unfolding of hFGF-2. Linear denaturant dependences of lnk are in general taken as an indication of a two-state folding transition (17Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar); however, it should be noted that they can also be associated with multiple state folding and cannot be taken as an unambiguous proof of a two-state folding process (18Mizuguchi M. Arai M. Ke Y. Nitta K. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Figure 3Determination of the temperature effect on the rate constants of refolding and unfolding of hFGF-2 as a function of denaturant. Only the rate constants of the major phase of the refolding reaction (small symbols: closed andopen symbols correspond to the bi- and monophasic refolding region, respectively) and of the unfolding reaction (large symbols) are shown. Refolding and unfolding experiments were performed at 15 (inverted triangles), 20 (diamonds), 25 (circles), 30 (squares), and 35 °C (triangles) at a protein concentration of 0.5 μmol·liter−1 in 0.1 mol·liter−1 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mol·liter−1 BME, and varying concentrations of denaturant. Please note that for clarity the rate constants of the very slow phase of refolding are omitted from this figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The refolding of hFGF-2 is also a slow process within the entire temperature range investigated. But in contrast to unfolding, there is not a pronounced effect of the temperature on the rate constants of refolding. Particularly, the rate constant of the major phase of refolding does not vary at a given temperature but is strongly affected by the denaturant concentration (Fig. 3). The small temperature effect on the rate constant of the very slow phase of refolding is discussed below. Thus, the kinetics of the major refolding phase are mainly determined by the residual denaturant concentration and not by the temperature. The denaturant dependence of lnk f of the major phase of refolding is linear suggesting that this phase is monophasic and not a composite of several folding transitions. However, other techniques such as circular dichroism spectroscopy or calorimetry which are not applicable, due to the low solubility of hFGF-2 folding intermediates, might reveal more intermediates on the folding pathway.Transition State Analysis of UnfoldingThe dependence of the unfolding rate constant on temperature and denaturant concentration was utilized to characterize the thermodynamic nature of the transition state during unfolding (15Eyring H. J. Chem. Phys. 1935; 3: 107-115Crossref Scopus (2918) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”).An Eyring plot (ln(k u·T -1)versus T -1) of the temperature dependence of the unfolding rate constant revealed a linear dependence at all denaturant concentrations investigated (Fig.4) indicating that there is no significant change in the heat capacity between the native and the transition state (19Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Therefore, the free energy of activation and the corresponding enthalpic and entropic components of unfolding of hFGF-2 as function of the denaturant concentration were calculated assuming that ΔH u‡andΔS u‡ are independent of the temperature within the temperature range investigated.Figure 4Eyring plot of the rate constant of unfolding of hFGF-2 . Unfolding experiments were performed in 2.0 mol·liter−1 (asterisks), 2.5 mol·liter−1 (triangles), 3.0 mol·liter−1 (crosses), 3.5 mol·liter−1 (circles), 4.0 mol·liter−1 (plus signs), and 4.5 mol·liter−1 GdmCl (squares) at a protein concentration of 0.5 μmol·liter−1 in 0.1 mol·liter−1 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mol·liter−1 BME, and varying temperatures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These calculations revealed that the enthalpy, the entropy, and the free energy of activation are linearly dependent on the denaturant concentration (Fig. 5). The activation free energy of unfolding of hFGF-2 is positive at all denaturant concentrations and decreases with increasing concentrations of GdmCl. Decreasing free energies of activation of unfolding with increasing denaturant concentration have been observed before (19Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 20Chen B.-L. Baase W.A. Schellman J.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). They indicate that the transition state interacts more strongly with the denaturant compared with the native state of the protein. The enthalpy of activation is also positive at all denaturant concentrations and decreases with increasing concentrations of GdmCl. A positive activation enthalpy of unfolding reveals that internal noncovalent interactions that are stabilizing the native protein are disrupted during the transition from the folded to the activated state. The decrease of the activation enthalpy with increasing concentrations of GdmCl indicates stronger solvation of the transition state compared with the native state of the protein. The activation entropy also decreases with increasing denaturant concentrations. The entropic term is positive at low denaturant concentrations but becomes negative above 2.4 mol·liter−1 GdmCl. Negative entropic values for the activation entropy for unfolding appear unexpected, but they have been reported previously (20Chen B.-L. Baase W.A. Schellman J.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Chen X. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6356-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They reflect the overcompensation of the loss of the conformational order by the concomitant ordering of solvent and co-solvent components caused by the disruption of hydrophobic interactions during the unfolding of the protein molecule. The high enthalpic barrier for unfolding at low denaturant concentrations is reduced by the gain in (conformational) entropy during the transition from the folded to the activated state. At high denaturant concentrations both the positive change in enthalpy and the negative change in entropy caused by the ordering of solvent molecules during the transition from the folded to the activated state contribute to the energy barrier for unfolding. Altogether, the slow unfolding kinetics of hFGF-2 are mainly (and at low denaturant concentrations exclusively) determined by the large positive change in enthalpy.Figure 5Thermodynamic characterization of the transition state of unfolding of hFGF-2 . Determination of the free energies of activation ΔG ‡(squares) and the corresponding enthalpicΔH ‡ (circles) and entropic components ΔS ‡ (triangles) of unfolding of hFGF-2 at 15 °C as a function of the denaturant concentration. Values were determined according to the transition state theory from data shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The maximum error associated with ΔG ‡, ΔH ‡, and ΔS ‡ is 3%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Transition State Analysis of the Major Phase of RefoldingThe Eyring plot of the rate constant of the major phase of refolding again emphasizes its temperature independence at a given denaturant concentration within the temperature range investigated (Fig.6). Chemical reaction rates generally increase with increasing temperature, but the opposite has been observed for protein folding reactions (22Oliveberg M. Tan Y.-J. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8926-8929Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Tan Y.-J. Oliveberg M. Fersht A.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that the refolding rate of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 and barnase initially increases and then goes through a broad maximum and finally decreases with increasing temperature. This affords into an Eyring plot of refolding with strong curvature resulting in positive activation enthalpies of refolding at low and negative values at high temperatures (22Oliveberg M. Tan Y.-J. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8926-8929Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Tan Y.-J. Oliveberg M. Fersht A.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The studies of the refolding of hFGF-2 have been in the temperature range where the rate constant of the major phase of refolding has reached its apparent highest value, thereby showing only a broad maximum in the Eyring plot (Fig. 6) where the enthalpy of activation for the major phase of refolding is approximately zero (Fig.7).Figure 6Eyring plot of the rate constant of the major phase of refolding of hFGF-2 . Experimental data from refolding experiments were determined at 0.5 mol·liter−1(squares), 0.7 mol·liter−1(circles), and 0.9 mol·liter−1 GdmCl (triangles) at a protein concentration of 0.5 μmol·liter−1 in 0.1 mol·liter−1 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mol·liter−1 BME, and varying temperatures. The experimentally determined rate constants near the transition region were corrected by subtracting the corresponding rate constants of unfolding to determine the true rate constant of the major refolding phase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Thermodynamic characterization of the transition state of the major refolding phase of hFGF-2 .Determination of the free energy ΔG ‡(squares, the enthalpic ΔH ‡(circles), and the entropic componentsΔS ‡ (triangles) of the activated state of the major phase of refolding of hFGF-2 at 15 °C as function of the denaturant concentration. Values were determined as described under “Results” and “Experimental Procedures” from data shown in Figs. 3 and 6. The maximum error associated withΔG ‡, ΔH ‡, andΔS ‡ is 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The enthalpy, the entropy, and the free energy of activation of the major phase of refolding as a function of denaturant concentration were calculated from the data shown in Figs. 3 and 6 with the simplification that the enthalpy of activation of the major refolding phase is set to zero and the assumption that the enthalpic and entropic terms do not show a significant change at a given denaturant concentration within the temperature range investigated (Fig. 7). The calculations revealed that the free energy of activation of the major refolding phase is positive at all denaturant concentrations and increases linearly with increasing concentrations of GdmCl indicating that the unfolded state interacts more strongly with the denaturant than does the transition state. The entropy of activation for the major refolding phase has negative values at all denaturant concentrations which decrease with increasing concentrations of GdmCl. Thus, the kinetics of the major refolding phase are exclusively controlled by entropic factors. The slow refolding kinetics must result from the loss of conformational freedom during refolding causing a strong decrease in the entropy during the transition from the unfolded to the activated state. The gain in entropy during refolding through the release of solvent and co-solvent components bound to the unfolded protein is largely overcompensated by the massive loss in conformational entropy.Transition State Analysis of the Very Slow Phase of RefoldingIn contrast to the rate constant of the major refolding phase, the rate constant of the very slow phase of refolding (only observable at low denaturant concentration, e.g. below 0.8 to 0.9 mol·liter−1 GdmCl) does not show a pronounced dependence on the denaturant concentration (see also Fig. 2). The Eyring plot revealed a slight temperature effect reflecting the modest increase of the refolding rate of the very slow phase with increasing temperature (Fig. 8). The data shown in Fig. 8 were utilized to calculate the enthalpy, the entropy, and the free energy of activation for the very slow phase of refolding. These calculations revealed values forΔH f2‡,ΔS f2‡, andΔG f2‡ of 33 kJ·mol−1, −190 J·mol−1·K−1, and 89 kJ·mol−1, respectively. Therefore, neither the major nor the very slow phase of refolding of hFGF-2 has properties consistent with proline isomerization, particularly, the activation enthalpies of refolding are low (≈0 and 33 kJ·mol−1, respectively). The activation enthalpies for proline isomerization are in general high and of the order of 80 kJ·mol−1 (7Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H.

Thiamin is the main form of the vitamin in blood plasma of animals and can be taken into cells across the membrane via carrier-mediated processes (3Rose R.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Inside the cells, thiamin is phosphorylated to TDP, a dominant form in almost all cells. TDP functions as a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, transketolase, and others (1Leder I.G. Greenberg D.M.

Primary structures and conformations of many of these TDP-dependent enzymes from various cells have been well studied, and the machinery and configuration of TDP as a transient intermediate carrier of the aldehyde group in the enzymes are characterized (6Schellenberger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In diseases such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which are caused by thiamin deficiency, decreases in the activities of one or more of the TDP-dependent enzymes are thought to account for the impairment of cell functions (7Haas R.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1988; 8: 483-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, TDP is the precursor for thiamin triphosphate that is suspected to have a specific role in neuronal activity (8Cooper J.R. Pincus J.H. Neurochem.

An important aspect of thiamin metabolism in mammals is the regulation of the intracellular levels of the four thiamin forms in a narrow range. The main factors involved in this regulation are membrane-associated thiamin transport systems and the cellular enzyme, thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK; EC 2.7.6.2). A number of biochemical analyses suggest that several types of thiamin transport systems exist in mammals, and in several cells the driving force for thiamin uptake appears to be its phosphorylation to TDP (3Rose R.C.

The isolation of the cDNA or genomic DNA for TPK from mammalian cells is indispensable for the elucidation of thiamin metabolism and its regulation in higher animals. In this study, we isolated a new mouse cDNA, whose translation product is homologous to the TPKs of the microorganisms, by the combination of expressed sequence tag (EST) database analysis, a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure (18Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and functional complementation screening using the yeast TPK-deficient mutant (thi80) (19Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2716-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression experiment in Escherichia coli showed that the cloned cDNA, termed mTPK1, produced the TPK activity. We also investigated the steady-state mRNA levels in various mouse tissues and two cultured cells grown under thiamin-sufficient or -deficient conditions. The E. coli strains DH5α and BL21 were used to amplify plasmids and express the recombinant protein, respectively. The S. cerevisiae thi80mutant strain used in this study was T48–2D (α thi80–1 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63) (16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The media and the growth conditions for the yeast and bacterial cells were as described previously (16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose in the yeast minimal medium was replaced with 2% galactose for inducing the transcription from the GAL1promoter in the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen). The mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro 2a (ATCC CCL-131), and the mouse normal liver cell line, NMuLi (ATCC CRL-1638), were purchased from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.; Suita, Japan. The mouse cells were grown in the special Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without thiamin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with glucose (6 mg/ml), 5% fetal bovine serum (Equitech-Bio; Ingram, TX), and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Under this condition the only source of thiamin was the fetal bovine serum, and the final thiamin concentration was 3.0 nm, which was determined using the method previously described (20Kawasaki Y. Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6145-6147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this medium will be referred to as thiamin-deficient medium. Also, thiamin-sufficient medium contained an additional 10 μm thiamin hydrochloride (Nacalai Tesque; Kyoto, Japan) than the thiamin-deficient medium. General methods for DNA and RNA manipulation and yeast or bacterial transformation were as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 22Rose M.D. Winston F. Maniatis T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of the S. pombe TPK gene (tnr3) (17Fankhauser H. Zurlinden A. Schweingruber A.-M. Edenharter E. Schweingruber M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28457-28462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used to conduct a text-based search of the mouse EST database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The sequence information of the obtained mouse clone AA981202 allowed the synthesis of three specific primers, F1 (5′-TGACCAAATCATGGCCTCTGTG), R1 (5′-TTCATGCTGAGCAACGAACCAG), and R2 (5′-TTAGCTCTTGATGGCCATGGT). PCR using the F1 and R1 primers produced a predicted 409-bp cDNA fragment from the SuperScript™ mouse 15.5-day embryo cDNA library made with pCMV-SPORT 2 as a cloning vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Amplification of the 5′-region was carried out following the two-step PCR procedure (18Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using an Advantage®-HF PCR kit (CLONTECH), which is capable of proofreading activity. The first PCR was performed using only the R1 primer to amplify a single-strand cDNA from the mouse embryo library as a template in a 25-μl reaction volume for 40 cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 63 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 3 min. The first PCR product was used as a template in the second run, where pCMV-F (5′-TACGCCTGCAGGTACCGGT) and R2 were used as primers to amplify the 5′-region cDNA. The PCR was carried out for 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 3 min at 68°C for 40 cycles. The second PCR product was directly ligated with pYES2 at the PvuII site and was subsequently transformed into the E. colistrain DH5α. Thus, the constructed library was used for the functional complementation analysis using the yeast thi80mutant. The full-length cDNA of mTPK1 was obtained from mouse embryo poly(A)+ RNA (Ambion) using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two specific oligonucleotides used were R4 (5′-ACAGTGACAAGGCCGGACCCATCGTAGG) for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and F3 (5′-CTCTCTCATCTACCTCCTCCAACCCGGG) for 3′-RACE. DNA sequencing of plasmid DNAs was performed using a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with synthesized nucleotides. The sequence of the full-length cDNA was confirmed by sequencing two clones that were generated using independent PCRs. Nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with programs from the GENETYX software package (Software Development; Tokyo, Japan). The intact open reading frame (ORF) of mTPK1 was amplified from pYES2-MT by the primers F2 (5′-cgcggatccATGGAGCATGCCTTTACCC), containing a BamHI site, and R3 (5′-cattggctcgagGCTCTTGATGGCCATGGT), containing a XhoI site. A bacterial expression vector coding for a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-mTPK1 fusion protein, pGEX-MT was made by inserting the mTPK1 ORF into aBamHI/XhoI site in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The E. coli strain BL21 bearing pGEX-4T-1 or pGEX-MT was grown overnight in 2 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, pelleted, grown for 2 h in 20 ml of fresh medium, and induced for 2 h with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 0.1 mm. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, and sonicated on ice for 10 min with an ultrasonic oscillator (Kubota; Tokyo). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was served as a crude extract. For examination of expression of themTPK1 gene in mouse tissues, a multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane (CLONTECH) was hybridized with the mTPK1ORF (see above) and the human β-actin cDNA as an internal control that had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (ICN Biomedicals) following the random primer labeling procedure. The washed membrane was exposed to X-Omat AR™ film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2 weeks (mTPK1) or 2 days (β-actin) at −80 °C. The content of mTPK1mRNA in cultured cells was investigated using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Total RNAs isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) were treated with deoxyribonuclease (Takara; Otsu, Japan) to eliminate residual genomic DNA. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 50 μl with the SuperScript™ preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT) as a primer. The synthesized cDNA (2 μl) was subsequently subjected to PCR with F1 and R1 primers in a total volume of 25 μl. After 15 cycles, 5 μl of the PCR product was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel, blotted onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with the mTPK1 probe. The membrane was exposed to the film for 1 day at −80 °C. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in cultured cells was investigated by Northern blot analysis using 10 μg of total RNA as described previously (16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane hybridized with the probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH) was exposed for 1 day at −80 °C. Thiamin-repressible acid phosphatase activity of the thi80 mutant on plates was detected using a staining method based on the diazo-coupling reaction (23Hansche P.E. Beres V. Lange P. Genetics. 1978; 88: 673-687PubMed Google Scholar). TPK activity was measured using the procedure described previously (16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the 1.5 ml of assay mixture containing 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm thiamin, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, and the enzyme source was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 0.3 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid. TDP in the reaction fluid was extracted with ethyl ether and determined using high-performance liquid chromatography after conversion to the corresponding thiochrome (24Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 60: 55-60Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The protein was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The deduced amino acid sequence of the S. pombe TPK gene, tnr3, was used to search a mouse EST database, and the entry AA981202 was identified as a potential homologue. The sequence of the AA981202 EST clone was 411 bp in length, and the predicted translation product had significant sequence similarity with the carboxyl-terminal moiety of the tnr3 protein. The F1 and R1 primers based on the sequence of AA981202 amplified a predicted 409-bp cDNA from a mouse embryo cDNA library, suggesting that the corresponding cDNA clone was present in this library. A two-step PCR was then performed to isolate the 5′-region of the cDNA, as described in Fig. 1. Because the R2 primer used in the second PCR involved the deduced stop codon of AA981202, the second PCR product was expected to contain the intact ORF and was inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 downstream of the yeast GAL1 promoter. Thus, the constructed library was employed to isolate the mouse TPK cDNA using functional complementation screening with theS. cerevisiae TPK-deficient thi80 strain. The expression of enzymes involved in yeast thiamin metabolism, such as thiamin-repressible acid phosphatase coded by the PHO3 gene (25Schweingruber M.E. Fluri R. Maundrell K. Schweingruber A.-M. Dumermuth E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15877-15882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are repressed by thiamin in the medium via the thiamin regulatory system, in which TDP serves as a corepressor (19Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2716-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression of PHO3 in the thi80 mutant is not repressed even under high concentrations of thiamin in the medium (Fig.2), which are caused by an insufficient increase in the intracellular concentration of TDP because of the low levels of TPK activity (16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A thi80 mutant, T48–2D, was transformed with the pYES2 library and plated on the agar medium containing 10−6m thiamin and 2% galactose without uracil. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 days, a total of 800 uracil-positive transformants were examined for the thiamin-repressible acid phosphatase activity using staining. About 100 transformants appeared as white colonies, and 8 colonies showed all the same plasmid, designated pYES2-MT, based on their restriction maps. As shown in Fig.2, T48–2D with pYES2-MT, as well as with the yeast THI80gene, showed a decrease in the phosphatase activity when grown in galactose medium, suggesting that the intracellular concentration of TDP in the thi80 mutant was increased by the product of the mouse cDNA inserted in pYES2-MT.Figure 2Functional complementation of the yeastthi80 mutant. A yeast thi80 mutant strain, T48–2D, bearing pYES2 or the pYES2 derivative was incubated for 3 days on agar medium containing 10−6mthiamin with 2% glucose or galactose as a carbon source and tested for acid phosphatase activity. The plasmid, pYES2-THI80, was constructed by ligating pYES2 with an EcoRI/SphI fragment containing the intact THI80 ORF from pTrc99A-THI80 (16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We identified an 835-bp mouse cDNA in pYES2-MT that contained a single ORF whose ATG translation start codon conformed to Kozak's rules (26Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The predicted protein encoded by the ORF contained 243 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 27,068. This numerical value was similar in size to the determined molecular mass of the purified TPK polypeptide from human red cells (28,000 Da) (13Egi Y. Koyama S. Shioda T. Yamada K. Kawasaki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this mouse ORF actually encodes TPK, we attempted to express the ORF as a GST fusion protein in E. coli, in which TPK does not exist and TDP is synthesized from thiamin monophosphate by thiamin-monophosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.16) (27Nishino H. Iwashima A. Nose Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows the patterns of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the crude extracts of bacterial cells expressing GST or the GST fusion protein. A 53-kDa band, which was almost consistent with the expected size, appeared in the crude extract of cells inducing the fusion protein. After the samples were dialyzed sufficiently, the TPK activities in the crude extracts were determined. As shown in Fig. 3 B, marked TPK activity was detected in the cells expressing the GST fusion protein, whereas no enzyme activity was detected in the cells expressing GST alone. When thiamin monophosphate, for which the TPK is completely inactive (1Leder I.G. Greenberg D.M. Metabolic Pathway: Metabolism of Sulfur Compounds 7. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 57-85Google Scholar), was used as substrate in place of thiamin, TDP formation was not observed in the cells. Moreover, potassium ions, which are required for thiamin-monophosphate kinase activity of E. coli (27Nishino H. Iwashima A. Nose Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), were not included in the mixture used for TPK activity. It was therefore concluded that this mouse ORF encodes a mouse TPK, and the cDNA was termed mTPK1. Until now almost all purified and recombinant TPKs have had dimeric structures (13Egi Y. Koyama S. Shioda T. Yamada K. Kawasaki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Hamada M. Seikagaku. 1969; 41: 837-849PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wakabayashi Y. Vitamins (Kyoto). 1978; 52: 223-236Google Scholar, 16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the comparison of the elution volume of TPK activity with those of standard proteins using gel filtration analysis, the molecular weight of the GST-mTPK1 fusion protein was estimated to be 110,000 (data not shown). This finding suggests that the native mouse TPK also exists in the dimer form of identical subunits. We compared the putative amino acid sequence of the mTPK1 protein with those of TPKs of other organisms such as S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, and P. denitrificans (Fig.4). The amino acid sequence of mTPK1 showed 39% identity with the carboxyl-terminal half of tnr3, which appears as a fusion protein (569 amino acids) with unknown function at the amino-terminal half (17Fankhauser H. Zurlinden A. Schweingruber A.-M. Edenharter E. Schweingruber M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28457-28462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mTPK1 protein was also similar to THI80 and pTPK1 over their full lengths (31% of amino acid identity). Amino acid sequence homology could not be detected between the conserved regions of TPKs and the TDP-dependent enzymes, suggesting that the structural feature in the interaction of amino acids with thiamin differs from that with TDP. It was also not possible to assign the ATP-binding site to any region of TPKs although many types of consensus sequences for peptide segments involved in nucleotide-binding sites are proposed (28Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The determination of functional domains in TPK polypeptides may facilitate the comprehension of the transfer mechanism of pyrophosphate from ATP to thiamin. To determine the expression pattern of the mTPK1 gene, we performed Northern blot analysis on various mouse tissues with the coding region as the probe. As shown in Fig.5 A, a 2.6-kilobase pair single band was detected predominantly in the kidney, followed by the liver, when the membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 2 weeks. The faint bands of the same length were detected in the heart, brain, and testis when analyzed using the bioimaging analyzer system (BAS2000, Fuji Photo Film; Tokyo) (data not shown). The length of these detected bands was about three times longer than that of mTPK1 cDNA inserted in pYES2-MT, suggesting that our cloned cDNA was not the full-length cDNA for the mTPK1 gene. Therefore, the full-length cDNA was isolated using the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE methods. The length of isolated transcript from mouse embryo mRNA was 2,563 bp, which was almost consistent with that of the detected bands. The full-length mTPK1 cDNA contained a 5′-noncoding region of 56 bp and a long 3′-noncoding region of 1.7 kilobase pairs, in which four putative polyadenylation sites, AATAAA (29Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar), were found (nucleotides 1000, 1796, 1800, and 2410. These findings indicated that the mTPK1 gene was expressed in a tissue-specific manner. An unexpected finding was that a very low level of mTPK1 expression was observed in the brain, in which the glucose and energy metabolism are aggressive. However, the distinctive mode of expression of the mTPK1 gene may be present in some areas of the central nervous system. It was previously demonstrated that the expression of the TPK gene (THI80) in S. cerevisiae is partially repressed by thiamin in the medium (16Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which intracellular TDP acts as a corepressor. In mammals, the relationship between the expression of TPK and the provision of thiamin are indistinct. Sanioto et al.(30Sanioto S.M. Reinauer H. Hollmann S. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1977; 47: 315-324PubMed Google Scholar) reported that TPK activity was reduced in liver and heart muscle of thiamin-deficient rats, whereas Trebukhina et al. (31Trebukhina R.V. Ostrovsky Y.M. Petushok V.G. Velichko M.G. Tumanov V.N. J. Nutr. 1981; 111: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that the activity was increased transiently in the livers of mice deprived of thiamin. To examine whether the expression of themTPK1 gene is controlled by thiamin or its phosphorylated derivatives, the effect of thiamin content in the medium on the steady-state mRNA level in mouse neuroblastoma and normal liver cell lines was investigated. Fig. 5 B shows the results of a reverse transcriptase-PCR experiment for mTPK1 in two cell lines growing for 2 weeks in thiamin-sufficient (10 μm) or -deficient (3.0 nm) medium. As expected from the results of the multiple tissue blot, the relative message level in neuroblastoma cells was about 20% of that in the liver cells by quantitation of radioactivity using the bioimaging analyzer system. However, the mRNA levels of both nerve and liver cells were unaffected by the thiamin concentration of the medium, suggesting that thiamin or a thiamin derivative does not participate in the regulation of mTPK1 in mouse cells. This finding was in contrast to TDP-dependent enzymes, such as transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, whose mRNA levels in human cultured cells are decreased by thiamin deficiency (32Pekovich S.R. Martin P.R. Singleton C.K. J. Nutr. 1988; 128: 683-687Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this is the first report on identification of the primary sequence for mammalian TPK. It was not possible to isolate mammalian TPK cDNA using a conventional functional complementation strategy, possibly because of the very low levels of expression of TPK. The successful cloning revealed in this study appeared to be caused by selective enrichment of the desired clone using the two-step PCR procedure. This study suggests that, using the mTPK1cDNA, progress will be made in understanding mammalian thiamin metabolism at the molecular level. Recently, we have isolated a human cDNA whose nucleotide sequence was nearly identical tomTPK1, and investigation to clarify the function of this human clone is in progress."

Tax lacks a conventional DNA binding domain, and the sequences in Tax that are in contact with DNA have not been previously identified. Analysis of cross-linked peptides now shows that the contact occurs between Tax residues 89 and 110, corresponding to a protease-sensitive linker joining two protein structural domains. The linker assumes a protease-resistant conformation in the cross-linked complex. Point mutations within the linker prevent cross-linking and interfere with Tax function. These data suggest that entry of Tax into the ternary complex may be coupled to folding of an unstructured protein domain, which then makes base-specific contacts with DNA.

In order to promote their own replication, many viruses have developed mechanisms to redirect the host cell transcription machinery to preferentially synthesize viral RNA. Human T-cell leukemia virus type I provides a well studied example.

Biochemical studies suggest that Tax activates proviral transcription, in large part, through an interaction with the host cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Tax alters the DNA binding specificity of CREB (6Brauweiler A. Garl P. Franklin A.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). CREB recognizes this site through a specific interaction of amino acids in the bZIP domain of the protein with functional groups in the major groove of DNA. In HTLV-I infected cells, Tax selectively stabilizes the binding of CREB to several extended sites in the proviral promoter known as Tax response elements. Each TxRE consists of an imperfect CREB site flanked by additional 5′ G-rich and 3′ C-rich elements (6Brauweiler A. Garl P. Franklin A.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol.

The effect of Tax on complex stability is attributable in part to an enhancement of CREB-CREB dimerization and in part to enhancement of protein-DNA interactions (6Brauweiler A. Garl P. Franklin A.A.

Cross-linking studies show that Tax itself makes two extremely restricted DNA contacts within the complex (23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These contacts are arranged symmetrically, 14 nucleotides apart, on opposite strands of the DNA. This places the contacts on the same face of the helix, 180° around the helical axis from the CREB dimerization domain. The formation of a Tax-CREB-DNA ternary complex at the proviral site is made even more significant because of an accompanying change in the interaction of CREB with the transcriptional coactivator, CBP. CBP ordinarily interacts selectively with CREB that has been phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase A (8Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 18Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The Tax-CREB-DNA ternary complex recruits CBP directly, bypassing the requirement for protein kinase A phosphorylation and allowing viral transcription to proceed constitutively, in the absence of cAMP-mediated signaling. (8Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Giebler H.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of Tax with the TxRE DNA is a key event in the viral life cycle. Although Tax has been exhaustively mutagenized, it lacks an identifiable DNA binding domain, and the mechanism by which it redirects CREB binding to the extended proviral site remains fundamentally a mystery. In the present study, we have used photochemical cross-linking to identify the specific peptide within Tax that is in contact with DNA. Aryl azide groups were introduced into the backbone of DNA at two specific sites by reaction of 4-azidophenacyl bromide with monophosphorothioate-containing DNA (23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Burgin A.B. Pace N.R.

Analysis of cross-linked adducts has identified sites of Tax-DNA contact within an exposed loop of the Tax protein that connects two structural domains. When Tax enters into a ternary complex with CREB and DNA, this loop becomes inaccessible to proteases, and we suggest that it folds into a defined conformation in order to make base-specific contacts within the 5′ and 3′ regions of the extended recognition site. Amino acid residues in Tax that contact DNA are immediately adjacent, within the primary sequence, to residues that interact with CBP. Thus, the same small region of Tax seems to be involved both in redirecting CREB-DNA binding specificity and in conferring cAMP-independent transcriptional activity. TaxH6 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography as described in Ref. 23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. CREB A protein was expressed inE. coli and purified by heparin-agarose chromatography as described (14Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The CREB bZIP protein (CREB 254–327) was expressed inE. coli and purified identically to CREB A. Binding reactions contained 0, 25, 50, or 100 nm CREB, 0 or 300 nm Tax, 520 pm [32P]DNA, 5.2 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and binding buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mmKCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm ZnSO4, 6% glycerol, 0.6 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a final volume of 20 μl. The wild type DNA probe was a 24-base pair fragment containing the most promoter-proximal of the three TxREs present in the HTLV-I promoter, and the symmetric DNA probe was a 22-base pair fragment containing a consensus cAMP response element and flanking regions (for sequence, refer to Fig. 1). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and binding was analyzed by 5% PAGE using a Tris-glycine running buffer (14Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Results were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Oligonucleotides containing a single phosphorothioate modification were obtained from Cybersyn (Lenni, PA) and from the Medical College of Georgia Molecular Biology Core Facility. Azido-modified, double stranded oligonucleotides were constructed from the phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides and 4-azidophenacyl bromide by the methods described in Ref. 23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. Tax (1700 nm) and CREB (1700 nm) were incubated with the azido-modified symmetric 32P-DNA probe (850 nm) in the absence of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer at room temperature for 15 min in a final volume of 6.5 ml. Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked by exposure to 302-nm ultraviolet light (AlphaImager 2000, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) for 30 s. The cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were separated from the free protein and DNA by 10% SDS-PAGE. The cross-linked complexes were excised from the gel and extracted by incubation overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The extracted material was subjected to complete digestion with trypsin under denaturing conditions (29Coligan J.E. Curr. Prot. Protein Sci.2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 11.1.1-11.1.11Google Scholar). The sample was incubated for 0.5 h at 37 °C, in 2m urea, 5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm Tris, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.025% SDS at pH 8, and then trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the reaction was continued for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptide-DNA adducts were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide loading buffer (90% deionized formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanole, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), and separated by electrophoresis in a gel containing 8m urea and 12% polyacrylamide. The peptide-DNA complexes were excised from the gel and extracted by overnight incubation in 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, and 10% acetonitrile. Extracted complexes were submitted for peptide sequencing at the Emory University Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA). Tax (300 nm) and CREB bZIP (600 nm) were incubated with the azido-modified symmetric DNA probe (520 pm) in the presence of 7.3 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer at room temperature for 15 min. The photocross-linked protein-DNA complexes were prepared as described previously (23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Trypsin (1.1 μg/ml) (Sigma) was then added to the reaction and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 0–40 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mg/ml, and the products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. For the N-terminal peptide sequencing of fragments 1 and 2, 100 μg of Tax was incubated in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol with 2.8 μg/ml trypsin (N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated) (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 2 ml. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 200 μl of 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reaction was dialyzed against 100 mm NH4OAc for 2 h and then against 10 mm NH4OAc for 2 h, lyophilized, resuspended in 1 ml of water, lyophilized again, and resuspended in 10 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer. The fragments were resolved by glycine-free SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (30Moos M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1998: 10.19.1-10.19.9Google Scholar). The electroblotted peptide fragments were submitted for peptide sequencing at Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). The sample for the sequencing of fragment 3 contained 15 μg of Tax, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 17 μg/ml trypsin in 75 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and was terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 μl of 4× SDS loading buffer. The fragments were resolved by glycine free SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (30Moos M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Antibody 88003 is a polyclonal anti-C-terminal Tax antibody (3Matthews M.A. Markowitz R.B. Dynan W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1986-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The rabbit used to produce antibody 88003 was originally immunized with a Tax-β-galactosidase fusion protein and was boosted with a C-terminal peptide conjugate. This resulted in a polyclonal serum that contains strong C-terminal reactivity and weak reactivity to the rest of the protein. Antibody 1314 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Reference Reagent Program) is a monoclonal anti-Tax antibody, which reacts with an epitope at the extreme C terminus of Tax. 2A. L. Kimzey and W. S. Dynan, unpublished data. Antibody 12701 is a polyclonal anti-N-terminal Tax antibody raised against peptide conjugate containing Tax residues 37–56 (SARLHRHALLATCPEHQITW) (Pocono Rabbit Farms, Canadensis, PA). Immunoblotting using antibodies 88003 and 1312 was performed using nitrocellulose membranes and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium detection (Promega). Immunoblotting using antibody 12701 was performed using polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and enzyme-catalyzed fluorescence substrate (Vistra ECF substrate, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmids containing the clustered point mutants of Tax (see Fig. 4 A) were made using an adaptation of a commercial method (QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla CA). The wild type Tax plasmid (31Giam C.-Z. Nerenberg M. Khoury G. Jay G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was subjected to polymerase chain reaction utilizing primers containing mutant sequences and a restriction site (SacI or HpaI). The mutant polymerase chain reaction products were purified, digested with the appropriate enzyme, purified again, ligated, subjected to DpnI digestion to remove any remaining wild type plasmid, and transformed into E. coli strain DH5α. The Tax protein was purified in an manner identical to wild type. In vitro transcription was performed as described (32Woodard R.L. Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using 120 ng of HeLa nuclear extract protein and 750 ng of circular plasmid template. The template consisted of four tandem copies of the promoter-proximal HTLV-I TxRE (14Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), joined to position −52 of the HTLV-I core promoter, joined at position +1 to a 380-nucleotide G-less cassette (gift of M. Anderson, Medical College of Georgia). A wild type oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 1 A), which is the same as was used in our previous studies, consisted of a partially symmetric 24-nucleotide sequence representing the most promoter-proximal of the three TxREs in the HTLV-I long terminal repeat (14Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A central imperfect CREB site was flanked by G-rich 5′ flanking and C-rich 3′ flanking sequences, as indicated. The binding of this DNA to CREB and Tax was measured in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Results were quantitated and are shown in Fig.1 B. The wild type oligonucleotide bound relatively weakly to CREB (K d > 100 nm), and the binding was stimulated 3–8-fold by Tax, consistent with previous results (23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To increase the efficiency of binding and simplify the analysis of products generated in subsequent cross-linking experiments, a new, idealized, symmetric 22-nucleotide probe was designed (Fig.1 A). The self-annealed symmetric DNA, which contained a perfect match to the consensus CREB site (18Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), bound more strongly to CREB than the wild type probe (Fig. 1 B). Tax further increased the level of this binding. To generate probes for site-specific cross-linking, the symmetric DNA probe was synthesized with a phosphorothioate group substituted for a backbone phosphate at the positions indicated (Fig. 1 A). Previous work has shown that these are the only positions on the DNA that strongly cross-link to Tax (23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The phosphorothioate-containing DNA was radiolabeled, self-annealed, and reacted with 4-azidophenacyl bromide to yield a photoreactive aryl azide, which is able to cross-link nonspecifically to protein functional groups within a 9-Å radius of its attachment point (25Burgin A.B. Pace N.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4111-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 33Meisenheimer K.M. Koch T.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 101-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to isolate and characterize Tax peptides present in cross-linked adducts. Protein-DNA complexes were formed, cross-linked, and isolated on a preparative scale. Because only a small percentage of the aryl azide groups form productive cross-links with protein, the protein-DNA adducts needed to be separated from free protein by SDS-PAGE. Tax and CREB are similar in size (40 and 35 kDa, respectively), and the Tax-DNA and CREB-DNA adducts migrate at overlapping positions (23Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These adducts are seen as the predominant radiolabeled band in Fig. 2 A(arrow). This band was excised from the gel. The remainder of the gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue R250, which revealed that free proteins migrated at the position marked (arrow) and were well resolved from the adducts (Fig. 2 A). The excised protein-DNA complexes were extracted from the polyacrylamide matrix and digested with trypsin under denaturing conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting peptide-DNA complexes were resolved by urea-PAGE and were detected by autoradiography (Fig. 2 B). Two peptide-DNA complexes were seen. We presume that the upper complex is a Tax adduct because it was seen only when the binding reactions contained Tax protein (data not shown). The lower band is apparently a CREB adduct because it was seen in all reactions containing CREB, whether or not Tax was also present. The complexes have been labeled accordingly in Fig. 2. A small amount of free DNA was also present. This may reflect a breakdown of adducts during purification, as well as some non-cross-linked DNA that was retained in the original protein-DNA complexes by base pairing. The Tax-DNA and CREB-DNA adducts were individually excised from the gel, extracted, and subjected to Edman degradation to identify the peptides that were present. The CREB-DNA adduct yielded protein sequence at the 2 pmol level. This sequence was (L)MXNX, where X denotes an unidentified amino acid, and the residue in parentheses is tentative. Although this sequence is short, it corresponds to a unique tryptic fragment within the CREB DNA binding domain, 276LMKNR (Fig.2 C). Because there was no cleavage after Lys278, and because this residue was not recovered as a PTH amino acid, it may be the residue that participates in adduct formation. A three-dimensional model of the CREB-DNA complex, showing the position of this residue (presented under “Discussion”) showed that the Lys278 side chain lies in close proximity to the modified phosphate. These results serve as an important control because they show that data obtained from analysis of the cross-linked CREB peptide agrees with structural predictions (34König P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) The Tax-DNA adduct yielded protein sequence at the 1 pmol level. This sequence was VLTPPITX(T)(T), which corresponds to a unique tryptic fragment of Tax, 89VLTPPITHTTPNIPPSFLQAR. Residue His96, which was not recovered as a PTH amino acid derivative, could be the actual site of cross-linking. Because this residue falls near the end of the readable sequence, however, this identification is tentative, and we cannot rule out the possibility that a more C-terminal residue in this peptide is the actual site of cross-linking. As described in the next section, the Tax peptide that we have identified is of particular interest because it appears to be part of a loop that connects two structural domains. It lies immediately adjacent to, but appears to be distinct from, a sequence that is involved in CBP binding (12Harrod R. Tang Y. Nicot C. Lu H.S. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Limited proteolytic digestion is an established method of determining protein domain structure. To apply this approach to the Tax-CREB system, ternary complexes were formed between Tax, the bZIP DNA binding domain of CREB, and DNA. The 9-kDa bZIP domain of CREB was used in place of full-length protein because it is small enough not to interfere with the visualization of proteolytic fragments of Tax. Cross-linking was performed, followed by partial digestion with trypsin. Products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was silver-stained to identify the bulk Tax digestion pattern (Fig.3 A) and was subjected to PhosphorImager analysis to identify the digestion pattern of the cross-linked Tax (Fig. 3 B). Three Tax fragments that were resistant to limited proteolysis under native conditions were visualized by silver staining (Fig.3 A). Although the digestion was performed in the presence of CREB bZIP domain and DNA, free Tax was in large excess over bound Tax in these reactions and the bulk digestion pattern (as observed in Fig.3 A) was indistinguishable from that obtained with Tax alone (data not shown). The CREB bZIP domain migrated well ahead of these fragments. We identified the proteolytic fragments of Tax by a combination of mass spectroscopy, immunoblotting and N-terminal sequence analysis. Fragment 1 contains the Tax N terminus but has lost a small segment at the C terminus. It was not reactive with an anti-C-terminal peptide antibody or with an anti-C-terminal monoclonal antibody but was reactive with an anti-N-terminal peptide antibody (Fig. 3 C). Edman degradation of this fragment yielded sequence beginning with residue 2 of Tax. Mass spectroscopy indicated that the C-terminal cleavage occurred after Lys346 or Arg349; thus the missing C-terminal region was 10 or 13 amino acids long, including the histidine tag (data not shown). Fragment 2 contains sequence extending from Val89 to the Tax C terminus, as determined by Edman degradation and the immunoblotting shown in panel C. Fragment 3 contains sequence starting at Val89, as determined by Edman degradation, and has lost a small segment at the C terminus as determined by immunoblotting. Presumably, the C-terminal cleavage sites are the same as in fragment 1. A diagram of the fragment assignments is shown in Fig. 3 D. Under these conditions, we can find no evidence for tryptic cleavage at Arg110 or Arg116, as has been reported by another group (35Nicot C. Tie F. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have noted, however that additional degradation products appeared if tryptic fragments were subjected to prolonged dialysis at low ionic strength in preparation for sequencing, a procedure that we subsequently avoided (data not shown). It may be that differences in sample processing account for the discrepancy in results. The pattern of protease susceptibility seen with the cross-linked fraction of the Tax differs dramatically from the bulk digestion pattern (compare Fig. 3, A and B). Fragments 2 and 3, resulting from cleavage between Lys88 and Val89, are essentially absent from the radiolabeled, cross-linked products. Because chemical analysis of the adducts shows that cross-linking occurs distal to this cleavage site, both fragments 2 and 3 should have been visible had cleavage occurred. Quantitation of these results showed that the amount of cleavage between Lys88 and Val89 in the cross-linked protein was reduced 10-fold or more relative to the bulk Tax. We conclude that cross-linking within the adjacent region, residues 89–109, hinders trypt"
https://openalex.org/W2068829023,"EAA26 (VESMNEELKKIIAQVRAQAEHLKTAY) is a better inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, integrase than its parent Lys-159, reproducing the enzyme segment 147–175 with a nonpolar-polar/charged residue periodicity defined by four helical heptads (abcdefg) prone to collapse into a coiled-coil. Circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, sedimentation equilibrium, and chemical cross-linking were used to analyze EAA26 in various trifluoroethanol/H2O mixtures. In pure water the helix content is weak but increases regularly up to 50–60% trifluoroethanol. In contrast the multimerization follows a bell-shaped curve with monomers in pure water, tetramers at 10% trifluoroethanol, and dimers at 40% trifluoroethanol. All suggest that interhelical interactions between apolar side chains are required for the coiled-coil formation of EAA26 and subsist at medium trifluoroethanol concentration. The NH temperature coefficients measured by nuclear magnetic resonance show that at low trifluoroethanol concentration the amide groups buried in the hydrophobic interior of four α-helix bundles are weakly accessible to trifluoroethanol and are only weakly subject to its hydrogen bond strengthening effect. The increased accessibility of trifluoroethanol to buried amide groups at higher trifluoroethanol concentration entails the reduction of the hydrophobic interactions and the conversion of helix tetramers into helix dimers, the latter displaying a smaller hydrophobic interface. The better inhibitory activity of EAA26 compared with Lys-159 could arise from its better propensity to form a helix bundle structure with the biologically important helical part of the 147–175 segment in integrase. EAA26 (VESMNEELKKIIAQVRAQAEHLKTAY) is a better inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, integrase than its parent Lys-159, reproducing the enzyme segment 147–175 with a nonpolar-polar/charged residue periodicity defined by four helical heptads (abcdefg) prone to collapse into a coiled-coil. Circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, sedimentation equilibrium, and chemical cross-linking were used to analyze EAA26 in various trifluoroethanol/H2O mixtures. In pure water the helix content is weak but increases regularly up to 50–60% trifluoroethanol. In contrast the multimerization follows a bell-shaped curve with monomers in pure water, tetramers at 10% trifluoroethanol, and dimers at 40% trifluoroethanol.

Biol. 1999; 285: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). IN has no cellular counterpart and can be therefore considered as a specific target for development of anti-HIV therapy (20Thomas M. Brady L. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we have reported (13Sourgen F. Maroun R.G. Frère V. Bouziane M. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that Lys-159, a peptide corresponding to the 147–175 segment of HIV-1 IN, inhibited the integration catalyzed by IN, most likely through specific binding to its counterpart in the protein. Such a specific binding was plausible since in the crystal structure of the catalytic core IN50–212, the major part of the target 147–175 segment (from residue 147 to 166) is stabilized under a characteristic amphipathic helix (helix α4) (Fig. 1) with most of its hydrophobic side chains strikingly oriented outward from the molecule (21Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The accessibility of the 147–175 segment to ligands has then been confirmed by the use of antibodies raised against the peptide Lys-159 (12Maroun R.G. Krebs D. Roshani M. Porumb H. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The antibodies not only bind specifically to IN and its catalytic core but also exhibit strong inhibitory activity against the enzyme, confirming both the surface exposure of the 147–175 segment and its biological importance. In fact, this segment has been shown to contain several critical residues for both the binding of IN to the LTR (long terminal repeats) ends of the viral genomic DNA and the DNA end processing (22Heuer T.S.

EMBO J. 1998; 16: 6849-6859Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These include, for instance, residues Glu-152, Lys-156, Lys-159, and Arg-166 oriented on the polar/charged face of the α4 amphipathic helix (Fig. 1). The peptide, EAA26, was primarily conceived to provide a better inhibition of the catalytic activity of IN than its parent peptide Lys-159 (12Maroun R.G. Krebs D. Roshani M. Porumb H. Auclair C.

Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), with the a and dpositions being all apolar residues (except position a of the first and second heptads occupied by Q and N, respectively). EAA26 results from Lys-159 through several modifications (three substitutions are as follows: K156E, G163A, and D167A; and four deletions are as follows: Ser-147, Gln-148, Gly-l149, and Val-150) tending to increase the helical stability and the packing potential of helices (Fig. 1). We used data from previous reports showing that helical content can be augmented by creating interactions between side chain residues (26Armstrong K.M. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) algorithms for the α-helical bundle propensity of the selected peptides. EAA26 was studied in various 2,2,2,-trifluoroethanol (TFE)/H2O mixtures, TFE being the solvent widely used that favors helical structure in polypeptides (38Goodman M. Litowsky I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 3770-3771Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The main effect of TFE is supposed to occur through either a direct or an indirect strengthening of the intrahelical hydrogen bonds (39Luo P. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 40Jasanoff A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 41Padmanabhan S.

Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar), although it has been recently suggested that helix stabilization by TFE would not depend on such a strengthening (43Kentsis A. Sosnick T.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14613-14622Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Actually, TFE may exert more specific effects depending on the chemical structure of the studied individual peptide or the individual peptide region. For instance, TFE can stabilize not only helices but also β-hairpin structures (44Blanco F.J. Jiménez M.A. Pineda A. Rico M. Santoro J. Nieto J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6004-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 45Ramirez-Alvarado M. Blanco F.J. Serrano L. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 1996; 260: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Obviously, effects on the balance of stabilizing forces are not the same at low and high TFE concentrations (9Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10923-10929Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 39Luo P. Baldwin R.L.

Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). At concentrations above 40% TFE, the medium becomes less like bulk water and more like bulk alcohol. Under the latter conditions, TFE disturbs the tertiary structures stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, entailing the exposure of apolar side chains (49Monera O.D. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19218-19227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the analysis of EAA26 has been carried out by combining circular dichroism (CD), NMR, chemical cross-linking, and sedimentation equilibrium. CD spectroscopy is a useful tool to study the formation of α-helices in aqueous and organic solutions. There is, however, a controversy on its ability to distinguish safely between straight α-helices (free helices or helices packed into bundles) and α-helices wrapped into coiled-coil structures (50Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1995; 36: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NMR which is very potent to analyze both secondary and tertiary structure also fails to discriminate between intra- and inter-monomer NOE connectivities in symmetric multimers, as only one set of resonances arises from the monomer (51O'Donoghue S.I. Junius F.K. King G.F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, equilibrium sedimentation can be safely used to establish the multimerization of biological molecules (Ref. 52****Google Scholar and references therein). The present work follows three previous studies by our group on the IN fragment 147–175 and the properties of derived peptides (12Maroun R.G. Krebs D. Roshani M. Porumb H. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Sourgen F. Maroun R.G. Frère V. Bouziane M. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Krebs D. Maroun R.G. Sourgen F. Troalen F. Davoust D. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we focus more particularly on the propensity of EAA26 to form in TFE a stable amphipathic helix and the impact of the latter on the α-helical bundle formation through hydrophobic contacts. We show that the way in which TFE affects the helix stability is subtle. The major idea is that in four-helix bundles, predominant at low TFE concentration, the amide groups of the residues involved in the hydrophobic core do not interact directly with TFE and do not show strengthened hydrogen bonds. The helix stabilization is induced through the interaction of TFE with the amide groups of residues belonging to the hydrophilic stripe and propagates through the peptide backbone to the residues situated within the hydrophobic stripe. Indeed, the overall stabilization of the α-helical conformation is reflected by the NOE and CSI values of all residues. In contrast, only those amide groups belonging to the residues of the outer hydrophobic stripe and that have direct access to TFE demonstrate an increase in the NH temperature coefficients. However, increasing the TFE concentration destabilizes the hydrophobic core of the four-helix bundles and leads to dimeric coiled-coils. Concomitantly, TFE gains better access to the amide groups of even the apolar residues, and consequently, we observe the formation of additional intrahelical hydrogen bonds in these dimeric structures. α-Helix secondary structure predictions were carried out using the AGADIR computer program kindly provided by the authors (33Muñoz V. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 34Muñoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 35Muñoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). AGADIR considers short range interactions between residues at different pH values and temperatures and allows us to predict the helicity per residue of peptides lacking tertiary interactions in solution. Structure predictions reliable for peptide segments (in the protein environment) were also performed using the GOR algorithm (53Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar, 54Biou V. Gibrat J.F. Levin J. Robson B. Garnier J. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Propensity of peptides to adopt coiled-coil structure was assessed using the COILS and PAIRCOILS programs (36Lupas A. Van Dyke M.V. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar, 37Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), based on the relative frequency of amino acid occurrence at each position (a–g) of the coiled-coil heptad repeat. The sequence of EAA26 compared with the segment of the native peptide Lys-159 (sequence 147–175 of IN) is shown in Fig. 1. EAA26 peptide was assembled according to a standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) procedure on an Applied Biosystems model 432A peptide automatic solid phase synthesizer and was purified and characterized as described previously (13Sourgen F. Maroun R.G. Frère V. Bouziane M. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Peptide concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 275 nm of the tyrosine residue added at the C terminus using an extinction coefficient, Δε275, of 1330 cm−1. The oligonucleotides S1 (5′GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA) and S2 (3′CACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA) used in integration assays were synthesized by solid-phase methodology using the phosphoramidate procedure on an Applied Biosystems 318B automatic apparatus. All DNA strands were purified through 15% denaturating (7 m urea) polyacrylamide gels and labeled at their 5′ end with γ-32P (12Maroun R.G. Krebs D. Roshani M. Porumb H. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CD spectra were acquired using a Jobin-Yvon Mark VI spectrometer linked to a PC microprocessor. Measurements were calibrated with (+)-10- camphorsulfonic acid. Samples prepared in aqueous solution at pH 3.5 and in appropriate H2O/TFE mixtures were placed in thermally jacketed cuvettes with 0.1, 1, and 10 mm path lengths. Spectra recorded with 1 nm steps and corrected for the base line were averaged over 10 scans. Before spectra recording, samples were incubated 10 min at the chosen temperature (25 °C) to allow the solutions to reach their equilibrium state. Effects of TFE addition (from 0 to 90% in aqueous solution) and of peptide concentration (from 10 to 1000 μm) on α-helix contents were determined at 25 °C. The α-helix content was estimated by direct reading of the circular dichroism, Δε (m−1·cm−1) at 222 nm, as described previously (13Sourgen F. Maroun R.G. Frère V. Bouziane M. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 55Zhong L. Johnson W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4462-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Samples of the peptide were dissolved and equilibrated on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in water/TFE mixtures (0, 10, or 40% TFE) containing 0.1 m NaCl (at pH 6.2, 6.6, and 6 respectively). 0.15 ml of sample solution was introduced in the centrifugation cell over 50 μl of fluorocarbon FC43. The corresponding equilibration buffer (0.21 ml) was introduced in the reference sector of each centrifugation cell. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman Optima-XLA analytical centrifuge, using standard double sector cells with 1.2-mm thick aluminum centerpieces. A temperature of 30 °C was chosen to minimize the formation of micro-particles of TFE as reported previously (56Gast K. Chaffotte A, F. Zirwer D. Guillou Y. Mueller-Frohne M. Cadieux C. Hodges M. Damaschun G. Goldberg M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cells were scanned at the wavelengths indicated in the text, which was selected to keep the absorbance below 1 in the entire cell at equilibrium. After reaching the selected centrifugation speed, radial scans were recorded at 2-h intervals for at least 18 h to check that equilibrium was reached. When equilibrium was achieved, 10 successive scans were recorded and averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio in the recordings. Scans at 360 nm, a wavelength at which neither the buffers nor the sample absorb light, were also recorded at equilibrium to check the absence of optical artifacts that might affect the base line (because of the low molecular weight of the peptide, meniscus clearance could not be achieved even at 60,000 rpm, thus precluding the determination of the absorbance base line). The protein distribution at equilibrium was analyzed with the Origin-based Optima XL-A Data Analysis Software (Beckman). The different fitting models (Ideal 1, Ideal 2, and Assoc4) for single data sets (XLA-Single program) were systematically tested, and the best fitting was retained on the basis of both the χ2 value and the lack of systematic deviation of the residuals. In all cases, the base line was fixed at 0 absorbance and not allowed to float during the fitting procedure. The value of the partial specific volume used for molecular weight calculations was 0.747 ml/g, as determined according to Cohn and Edsall (57Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Aminoacids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. van Nostrand-Reinhold, Princeton, NJ1943: 370-381Google Scholar) from the amino acid composition of the EAA26 peptide. The densities of the NaCl solutions containing 0, 10, and 40% TFE were determined by use of a volumetric pycnometer (Prolabo, Paris, France) and found to be 1.004, 1.051, and 1.178 g/ml, respectively. Chemical cross-linking was performed with glutaraldehyde for EAA26 under three experimental conditions, namely 0, 10, and 40% TFE solutions containing 0.1 m NaCl, at pH 6.2, 6.6, and 6, respectively. The peptide EAA26 was dissolved at a final concentration of 50 μm in a total volume of 100 μl. After 15 min equilibration period, glutaraldehyde was added to 0.001% (mass/volume). 50 μl of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at 180 min. The reaction was stopped with 5 μl of NaBH4, 2 m. Each aliquot was mixed with 10 μl of sample buffer (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6, 8 50% glycerol (mass/volume), 0.05% bromphenol blue (mass/volume), and 10% SDS (mass/volume). The cross-linked products were analyzed by Tris/Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (58Shagger H. van Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10408) Google Scholar). The separating gel (16% acrylamide) resolution was increased by inserting a 10% spacing gel between stacking and separating gels. The separated products were detected by silver staining (59Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). One- and two-dimensional proton NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz in a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer and processed on a Silicon Graphic Station with the FELIX (MSI) software. Samples of EAA26 (∼2 mm) were analyzed under three different conditions as follows: aqueous solution (90% H2O, 10%2H2O); TFE 20%, H2O 80%; and TFE 60%, H2O 40%. The pH, not adjusted, measured by a glass electrode was nearly 3.0. All the samples contained 1 mmEDTA and a small amount of TSP, introduced as an internal chemical shift reference. Two-dimensional 1H NOESY and TOCSY experiments were recorded at 10, 20, 30, and 40 °C in order to determine the NH temperature coefficients. Solvent suppression was achieved either by presaturating the solvent signal or by using a gradient pulse WATERGATE (60Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3486) Google Scholar). These experiments were typically acquired with 2048 × 512 complext 1 points, a spectral width of 11 ppm, and a relaxation delay of 1–1.5 s. Mixing times were in the 80–120-ms range for TOCSY experiments and in the 50–300-ms range for NOESY experiments. Spectra were zero-filled (2048/1024 real points inf 2/f 1 dimensions) and subjected to shifted sine bell weighting functions (Π/6 generally) in both dimensions before Fourier transformation. Quantification of sequential NOEs was achieved by calculating the relative intensities in contour plot spectra between sequential d NN ord βbN and intra-residued αaN connectivities to the sequentiald αaN ones, taking into account (averaging) the parts below and upper the diagonal of spectra. Molecules were visualized and plotted using the Insight II program (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphic workstation O2 R10000. In a previous paper (24Krebs D. Maroun R.G. Sourgen F. Troalen F. Davoust D. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) we have mentioned that EAA26 was a better inhibitor of IN compared with Lys-159 (segment 147–175 of HIV IN). Its amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1, together with that of its parent Lys-159 and the profile of α-helix content predicted by AGADIR (33Muñoz V. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 34Muñoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 35Muñoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The latter reflects an average peptide helicity of nearly 25%, which is much higher than the helicity shown by Lys-159 (about 5%) (13Sourgen F. Maroun R.G. Frère V. Bouziane M. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Changing the pH does not significantly affect the profile of helix content. The curve shows that helicity increases abruptly from about 2% at Ser (i) to nearly 40% at Lys (i + 3). This maximum of helicity is maintained along the next 9–10 residues in the sequence but gradually decreases along the last 10 C-terminal residues. COILS (36Lupas A. Van Dyke M.V. Stock J.

The first step of this pathway, the reaction of dolichol phosphate with UDP-GlcNAc to formN-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol), is under investigation as a possible site of metabolic regulation. This report describes feedback inhibition of this reaction by the second intermediate of the pathway,N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol), and product inhibition by GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol itself. These influences were revealed when the reactions were carried out in the presence of showdomycin, a nucleoside antibiotic, present at concentrations that block the de novo formation of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol but not that of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. The apparent K i values for GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol under basal conditions were 4.4 and 2.8 μm, respectively. Inhibition was also observed under conditions where mannosyl-P-dolichol (Man-P-dol) stimulated the biosynthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol; the apparent K i values for GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol were 2.2 and 11 μm, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the types of inhibition indicated competitive inhibition by GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol toward the substrate UDP-GlcNAc and non-competitive inhibition toward dolichol phosphate. Inhibition by GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was uncompetitive toward UDP-GlcNAc and competitive toward dolichol phosphate. A model is presented for the kinetic mechanism of the synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol also exerts a stimulatory effect on the biosynthesis of Man-P-dol, i.e. a reciprocal relationship to that previously observed between these two intermediates of the dolichol pathway.

Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.K. Schachter H. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1995: 127-143Google Scholar). Our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this complex series of reactions, however, is still limited. To this end we have directed our attention to the initial reaction of the pathway, the reaction between dolichol phosphate and UDP-GlcNAc producing GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol,1catalyzed by the enzyme, UDP-GlcNAc:dolichyl-phosphateN-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate transferase (GPT-1). Factors that modulate the formation of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol could have an effect on the rate of synthesis of the other intermediates of the dolichol pathway and thus influence nascent glycoprotein biosynthesis in general. Several factors have previously been described that could have a regulatory influence on this reaction as follows: hormonal effects (2Hayes G.R. Lucas J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15095-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), genetic factors (3Lennon K. Pretel R. Kesselheim J. te Hessen S.

A reciprocal relationship has now been revealed whereby Man-P-Dol formation is stimulated by GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. The present study has revealed other potential aspects of regulation of the initial reaction of the dolichol pathway. Feedback inhibition of the biosynthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was demonstrated by the second intermediate of the pathway, GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. The formation of the latter compound is catalyzed by a separate GlcNAc-transferase, UDP-GlcNAc:GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, N-acetylglucosamine transferase (GT-2), the kinetics of which have recently been described (16Kean E.L. Niu N. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although the reversibility of GPT-1 has previously been demonstrated (17Heifetz A. Keenan R.W. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Harford J.B. Waechter C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the present report also described the kinetics of inhibition by GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol of its own synthesis. 2Preliminary reports of some of these studies have been made (Kean, E. L., Niu, N., and Imperiali, B. (1996)Glycobiol. 6, 740; Kean, E. L. (1997)Glycoconj. J. 14, (suppl) S35). 2Preliminary reports of some of these studies have been made (Kean, E. L., Niu, N., and Imperiali, B. (1996)Glycobiol. 6, 740; Kean, E. L. (1997)Glycoconj. J. 14, (suppl) S35). We have examined the effect of these inhibitory influences on the biosynthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol at the basal level and under stimulatory conditions in the presence of Man-P-dol. On the basis of these relationships a model is suggested as a mechanism of action of UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate, GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase. Microsomes were prepared from the retinas of 15–16-day-old embryonic chicks as described previously (10Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12561-12571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified, recombinant yeast mannosyl-P-dolichol synthase was obtained from Dr. John Schutzbach. Dolichol phosphate was purchased from Sigma. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and GDP-[14C]mannose were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, and GDP[3H]mannose were purchased from American Radioactive Chemicals, Inc.d-(+)-Showdomycin was obtained from Dr. Sung Ho Kang, Department of Chemistry, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, Korea. N-Benzyl-2′-deoxyshowdomycin was obtained from Dr. R. S. Hosmane, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore. Large scale preparations were performed by incubating microsomes from the retina of the embryonic chick with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc and dolichol phosphate, as described previously (10Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12561-12571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubations were performed in the presence also of Man-P-Dol and the antibiotic, showdomycin. As described previously, the former stimulates the production of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (7Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7952-7954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kean E.L. Biochim.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10508-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the latter both inhibits the formation of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and also brings about an increase in the production of the mono-GlcNAc derivative (19Kean E.L. Wei Z. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The product was isolated by solvent partitioning according to the procedure of Folch et al. (20Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, as described previously (10Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12561-12571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its concentration was determined by Dionex chromatography, as described below. By using dolichol kindly provided by Dr. Tadeusz Chojnacki of the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Warsaw, Poland, GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was initially synthesized by the method of Imperiali and Zimmerman (21Imperiali B. Zimmerman J.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 6485-6488Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which requires azeotropic drying (toluene or pyridine) at the stage of the oxalyl chloride-mediated coupling of dolichol phosphate to the per-O-acetyl-GlcNAc-P pyridinium salt. Acceptable yields of the latter intermediate could be obtained only by careful azeotropic drying of all commercial ingredients (including tetraethylammonium chloride and dibenzylphosphate) and use of freshly distilled solvents. In the published method (21Imperiali B. Zimmerman J.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 6485-6488Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), oxalyl chloride activation of dolichol phosphate generates the highly activated dolichylphosphoryl dichloride, which actually is an intermediate in the POCl3-mediated preparation of dolichol phosphate but which could not successfully be coupled directly to the protected GlcNAc-P, and was instead hydrolyzed to dolichol phosphate, which was then purified and reactivated with oxalyl chloride. During this study, it was found that the requisite dolichylphosphoryl dichloride could in fact be generated from dolichol in a directly usable form using excess POCl3 in hexane, followed by a brief extraction with water to remove HOPOCl2, and then evaporation of hexane and remaining POCl3 under high vacuum. Following coupling, purification of the protected pyrophosphate prior to NaOMe-mediated deacetylation was achieved by silica gel 60 column chromatography using CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (65:25:4, by volume) as the eluant. These modifications, which avoid the need to isolate and purify dolichol phosphate, resulted in the best overall yield of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol from dolichol. The enzymatically and chemically synthesized GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol functioned in a similar manner in these studies. Large scale preparations of [14C]Man-P-Dol were made by incubating dolichol phosphate, GDP[14C]mannose (1.7 dpm/pmol), buffer, and metal ions as described previously (12Kean E.L. Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10508-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with extracts fromMicrococcus luteus provided by Dr. Charles J. Waechter and Dr. Jeffrey S. Rush of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, or a purified, recombinant yeast dolichyl-P-synthase from yeast provided by Dr. John S. Schutzbach, Department of Biochemistry, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL. Purification was carried out by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose acetate as described previously (22Kean E.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 23Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by preparative thin layer chromatography at 4 °C on 0.5-mm thick plates of Silica Gel 60 (Merck) as described previously (10Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12561-12571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated by guide strips, the Man-P-dolichol region was scraped from the plates and recovered by leaching the gel in the cold with C/M (chloroform/methanol)/water (10:10:3) followed by C/M (2:1). After solvent partitioning by the procedure of Folch et al. (20Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration of [14C]Man-P-Dol was calculated from the specific activity of GDP[14C]mannose used in its preparation. Incubations were carried out for 10–20 min at 37 °C in the presence of dolichol phosphate (16–20 μm), Triton X-100 (0.15%), UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (52 μm; 169 dpm/pmol), MgCl2 (27 mm), showdomycin, orN-benzyl-2′-deoxyshowdomycin, as indicated, and enzyme (0.2–0.25 mg of protein) in a total volume of 0.15 ml (basal conditions). Reactions were also carried out in the presence of Man-P-Dol (2.1–6.4 μm) (stimulatory conditions). The incubations were performed in the absence or presence of exogenously added GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol or GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (as indicated in the tables and figures). The dolichol derivatives were evaporated to dryness with nitrogen, vortexed vigorously with 0.015 ml of 1.5% Triton X-100, after which the other components of the reaction mixture were added. The incubations, carried out at 37 °C, were started by the addition of the enzyme preparation and stopped by the addition of C/M (2:1). After solvent partitioning by the Folch procedure (20Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the radioactivity in the washed lower phase was determined by scintillation spectrometry, as described previously (7Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7952-7954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12561-12571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Embryonic chick retina microsomes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in a medium containing GDP-[3H]mannose (1.9 μm, 200 dpm/pmol), dolichol phosphate (16 μm), MnCl2 (20 mm), Triton X-100 (0.2%), Tes buffer (0.2 m, pH 7.45), in the presence or absence of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (as indicated), and enzyme in a total volume of 0.15 ml, as described previously (24Kean E.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 25: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The products were analyzed by scintillation spectrometry after Folch washing, as described above. Dilutions of purified, full-length, recombinant yeast Man-P-Dol synthase (25Schutzbach J.S. Zimmerman J.W. Forsee W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24190-24196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were made in a buffer 3J. S. Schutzbach, personal communication. containing 10% glycerol, 0.015 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (the latter acted to stabilize the enzyme upon dilution). Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 10 min essentially as described by Schutzbach et al. (25Schutzbach J.S. Zimmerman J.W. Forsee W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24190-24196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a medium containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (w/v), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 32 μm dolichol phosphate, GDP-[3H]Man (18 μm, 12–22 dpm/pmol) in the presence or absence of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (as indicated) and enzyme in a total volume of 0.15 ml. The products were analyzed by scintillation spectrometry after Folch washing, as above. After incubation followed by solvent partitioning as above, the material in the washed organic phase was evaporated to dryness and subjected to mild acid hydrolysis in 1 ml of 0.1 n HCl in 80% tetrahydrofuran for 100 min at 50 °C as described previously (26Lucas J.J. Waechter C.J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1992-2002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After evaporation to dryness and redissolving in water, the material was applied to a column containing 0.5 ml each of AG-2-X8 (200–400 mesh) acetate and AG-50-X8 H+ (200–400 mesh), the column eluted with 20 ml of water, the eluate evaporated to dryness, and the residual material redissolved in water as described previously (16Kean E.L. Niu N. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To an aliquot was added 5 nmol of fucose to serve as an early eluting reference marker and 10 nmol each of GlcNAc and GlcNAc-GlcNAc to serve as internal standards for analysis by high pH anion exchange chromatography (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The mixture was injected onto a CarboPAc 1 column (4 × 250 mm) with a Carbo PAc guard column (3 × 25 mm) and eluted isocratically with a mixture of 25% of 100 mm NaOH plus 75% 1 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution of the standards was followed by pulsed amperometric detection (high pH anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection), and the products of the reactions by measuring their radioactivity by scintillation spectrometry of 0.5-ml fractions collected from the pulsed amperometric detection cell, as described previously (27Prasad A.V.K. Plantner J.J. Kean E.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of GPT-1 and GT-2 was investigated by analyzing the distribution of the tritium label in the GlcNAc residues of their respective products, GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, as described previously (28Kean E.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29Kean E.L. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In short, this involves the following procedures carried out sequentially. After incubation, the GlcNAc lipids extracted into the chloroform-rich layer after solvent partitioning are subjected to mild acid hydrolysis. GlcNAc and GlcNAc-GlcNAc thus formed are separated by paper chromatography, recovered from the chromatogram, and reduced with NaBH4. After mixed bed ion exchange chromatography, strong acid hydrolysis N-deacetylates the products and cleaves chitobiose. The products are then subjected to high voltage paper electrophoresis in 1% sodium borate buffer, the electrophoretogram cut into 1-cm zones, and the radioactivity determined by scintillation spectrometry. The mobilities of standard [3H]GlcNH2 and [3H]GlcNH2OH were determined in the same manner. By these procedures glucosaminitol would have been derived from GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol after hydrolysis and glucosamine from the non-reducing end of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol after hydrolysis and glucosaminitol from the reducing end. The concentration of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was determined after mild acid hydrolysis, as above, by quantitative Dionex chromatography of the liberated GlcNAc and by the Morgan-Elson reaction as described by Reissig et al. (30Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. LeLoir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, provided by Dr. B. Imperiali, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, was determined by Dionex chromatography ofN,N′-diacetylchitobiose liberated by mild acid hydrolysis. The concentration of dolichol phosphate and the GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol used in the early phases of this work (provided by Dr. Imperiali) was determined by analysis for total phosphate as described previously (10Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12561-12571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total microsomal phospholipids were determined in a similar manner after solvent partitioning (20Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of retina microsomes. Thin layer chromatography was performed using 20 × 20-cm glass plates precoated with a 0.25- or 0.50-mm layer of Silica Gel 60 without fluorescent indicator. The following solvent systems were used: 1) chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2, by volume); 2) chloroform/methanol/ water (65:25:4, by volume). The location of radioactive material was accomplished by measuring the radioactivity by scintillation spectrometry of 1 × 3-cm zones scraped from the chromatogram. The migration of non-radioactive material was detected by the anisaldehyde spray reagent or by exposure to iodine vapor, as described previously (24Kean E.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 25: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Incubations carried out using dolichol phosphate and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as substrates would result in the formation of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and [3H]GlcNAc-[3H]GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. Thus, in assays carried out by solvent partitioning, any effect added compounds might have specifically on the new synthesis of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol would be masked by the accompanying formation of the labeled chitobiosyl product. This difficulty was resolved by carrying out the incubations in the presence of the nucleoside antibiotic, showdomycin, which inhibits the formation of the chitobiosyl compound, enhancing the formation of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (19Kean E.L. Wei Z. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The N-benzyl-2′deoxy derivative was shown to have the same effect (19Kean E.L. Wei Z. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, using concentrations of the showdomycins that extensively inhibited the formation of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, the effect of exogenously added non-radioactive GlcNAc-P-P-Dol on the de novo synthesis of the labeled compound could be readily determined. Apparent K i and V maxvalues were calculated from a non-linear least squares analysis of the data using GraFit (31Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit Version 3.0. Erithacus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar) fit to an expression for general inhibition derived from Equation 1 for mixed inhibition with a constant substrate concentration. v(inhibited)=V(uninhibited)(1+[I]/Kiapparent)Equation 1 Analyses of the types of inhibition were carried out in the following manner. The steady state kinetic data were fitted using the unweighted non-linear least squares method implemented in the computer program GraFit (31Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit Version 3.0. Erithacus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). Inhibition constants were determined by a global fit of the data from an entire experiment. The best fit of the data is one that minimizes the sum of the square of the observed and calculated velocities for an entire data set (32Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). The standard deviations of the data points were within 3% of the highest velocity. The data were initially fitted to Equation 2 for non-competitive or mixed inhibition. By using the criterion that if the standard error of the slope or intercept inhibition constants were over 50% of the fitted value, that parameter was excluded from the final fit. If so, the data were then fit to Equation 3 or Equation 4 for competitive and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively. The more restrictive mechanism was accepted if the χ-squared value was not increased by omitting the poorly defined inhibition constant. v=Vmax·SKm(1+I/Kis)+S(1+I/Kii)Equation 2 v=Vmax·SKm(1+I/Kis)+SEquation 3 v=Vmax·SKm+S(1+I/Kii)Equation 4 Incubations were carried out under initial rate conditions for the yeast and retina microsomal enzymes. Apparent K aand V max values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots of the data after analysis by computer using the Kcat program (BioMetalics, Princeton, NJ). Incubations were carried out under optimal conditions of GlcNAc lipid synthesis as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence or absence of exogenously added GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. The incubation mixtures additionally contained concentrations of showdomycin that inhibited 93–99% of the formation of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. As seen in Fig.1 A, with increasing concentrations of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol there was increasing inhibition (over 70%) of GlcNAc lipid synthesis. This effect on GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol biosynthesis occurred at the basal level and when the reaction was performed in the presence of Man-P-Dol shown previously to greatly stimulate its formation (10Kean E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12561-12571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, either under basal or stimulatory conditions, exogenously added GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was present over a range from 2- to 86-fold over the [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol formed in the absence of the inhibitor. (The curves in Fig. 1 were drawn in accord with an analysis of the data by Equation 1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”) The nature of the products formed under these conditions after analysis by Dionex chromatography is seen in Fig.2. Fig. 2 A shows a typical example of the distribution of the mono-GlcNAc and chitobiosyl products formed under basal conditions in the absence of showdomycin. As seen in Fig. 2 B, under basal conditions in the presence of showdomycin, there was now extensive inhibition of the formation of the chitobiosyl product (solid line) and an increase in the formation of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (solid line) as described previously (19Kean E.L. Wei Z. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When the reaction was carried out in the presence also of exogenously added GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (18 μm), there was now an 86% decrease (diamond symbols) in the de novo formation of [3H] GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. Exogenously added GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was present in 360-fold molar excess over the [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol formed in its absence. Similar results were obtained when the reactions were performed under stimulatory conditions, i.e. in the presence of Man-P-dolichol (Fig. 2 C). The formation of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol under these conditions was reduced 97% in the presence of showdomycin (filled circles). When the reaction was carried out in the presence also of exogenously added GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol (18 μm), the formation of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was decreased 88% (diamonds). The added GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol was present in 56-fold molar excess over that formed in its absence. The reaction between GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol and UDP-GlcNAc catalyzed by GT-2 results in the formation of the chitobiosyl derivative. As seen in Fig. 1 B, when GlcNAc lipid synthesis was examined in the presence of exogenously added GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, inhibition of about 90% of that formed in the absence of the inhibitor was attained. As with the mono-GlcNAc derivative (Fig. 1 A), inhibition was also induced and to a similar extent when the reaction was stimulated by the addition of Man-P-Dol as seen also in Fig. 1 B. Shown in Fig. 2 D is an identification of the products from experiments of this type using Dionex chromatography. The presence of showdomycin resulted in the essentially complete (96%) inhibition of the formation of the chitobiosyl derivative. When the incubation was"

Erythropoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2was time- and dose-dependent. By using FDC-P1 cells transfected with an erythropoietin receptor devoid of tyrosine residues, we showed that both effects required the tyrosine residues of intracellular domain on the erythropoietin receptor.

The erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R)1 belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily, and its cytosolic domain lacks intrinsic kinase activity. Nevertheless, ligand binding leads to a rapid but transient tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including the receptor itself (3Miura O. D'Andrea A. Kabat D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

This phosphorylation is carried out via the activation of an associated tyrosine kinase, JAK2 (6Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N.

Epo-R tyrosine phosphorylation creates binding sites for Src homology domain 2 (SH2) containing proteins such as Grb2, Shc, Stat5, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP1, and SHP2 that relay and amplify the signals (for review see Ref. 8Damen J.E. Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 1455-1459PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) molecules with the general structure lipid-phosphate-inositol glycan have been isolated from plants, bacteria, yeast, parasitic protozoa, and mammalian cells (9Ferguson M.A. Williams A.F.

In eukaryotic cells, GPI molecules may be attached to protein moieties thereby providing a membrane anchor. Free GPIs also exist under an uncomplexed form. Both forms of GPI have been shown to participate in signal transduction events (for review see Ref. 12Jones D.R. Varela-Nieto I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In different cellular systems GPI turnover is modulated by a variety of hormones, cytokines, and growth factors such as insulin (13Saltiel A.R. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Signal. 1994; 6: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Then the hydrolysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol could be another pathway in signal transduction. GPI hydrolysis generates diacylglycerol and the polar group of the lipid, an inositol phosphoglycan (IPG) which can act as a second messenger (for review see Ref. 22Varela-Nieto I. Leon Y. Caro H.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 115: 223-241Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The dependence on increased receptor phosphorylation and GPI hydrolysis after growth factor stimulation remains to be conclusively defined. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors were shown to be able to partially block epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated GPI hydrolysis (23Clemente R. Jones D.R. Ochoa P. Romero G. Mato J.M. Varela-Nieto I. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and hydrolysis of GPI in response to insulin is reduced in cells bearing kinase-deficient insulin receptors (24Villalba M.

Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1373-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The nature of the phospholipase C (PLC) responsible for hormone-induced GPI hydrolysis is still unknown. Mammalian GPI-PLC was partially purified from rat liver membranes (26Fox J.A. Soliz N.M. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus was shown to facilitate the release of some PI-glycan-ethanolamine-anchored proteins as PI-PLC isolated from trypanosomes (27Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W.

Among eukaryote PI-PLC isoforms, only the γ1 and γ2 types contain SH2 and SH3 domains and become potential candidates for binding to phosphotyrosine residues during Epo receptor activation (29Cantley L.C.

Epo activation of a PLC was suggested in erythroid progenitor cells (32Mason-Garcia M. Clejan S. Tou J.-S. Beckman B.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1197-C1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PLC-γ1 activation was evidenced in UT7 cells (33Ren H.-Y. Komatsu N. Shimizu R. Okada K. Miura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19633-19638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but Epo activation of PLC-γ2has never been described, whereas PLC-γ2 activation by macrophage-colony-stimulating factor has been described in FDC-P1 cells (34Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.-L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that erythropoietin induces a rapid and transient hydrolysis of GPI and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2. Both effects require the presence of the same tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of Epo receptor. We show that Epo-activated PLC-γ2 is able to hydrolyze purified [3H]GPI. Our results suggest that tyrosine Y1(Tyr343), Y2 (Tyr401), Y7, and/or Y8(Tyr464 and/or Tyr479) are implicated in Epo-induced GPI hydrolysis and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2, whereas tyrosines Y3 and/or Y4 (Tyr429 and/or Tyr431) seem to be involved in Epo-induced inhibition of GPI hydrolysis. Thus, our results strongly suggest that Epo regulates GPI hydrolysis via tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor and PLC-γ2activation. Purified recombinant human erythropoietin (specific activity of 120,000 units/mg) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [1-3H]Ethan-1-ol-2-amine hydrochloride (26 Ci/mmol) and d-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (33 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-PLC-γ2 antibodies (catalog number (Q-20) sc-407) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) (catalog number 17-123) and anti-JAK2 antibodies (catalog number 06-255) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. ECL substrate solution was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. α-MEM, Iscove Dulbecco's medium, and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The intracellular domain of the murine Epo receptor contains 8 tyrosines as follows: Tyr343(Y1), Tyr401 (Y2), Tyr429 (Y3), Tyr431(Y4), Tyr443 (Y5), Tyr460 (Y6), Tyr464(Y7), and Tyr479 (Y8) of the mature protein. Epo-R mutants were constructed as described previously (35Gobert S. Chretien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of Epo-R wild type (WT) and mutants is done in Fig. 1. The Y1–2F3–4Y5–8 Epo-R mutant was kindly provided by Dr. U. Klingmüller (Zentrum fur Molekulare Biologie, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany). FDC-P1 cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 3% WEHI conditioned media as a source of interleukin-3. Stable transfections of murine Epo-R cDNA into FDC-P1 cells were done as described previously (35Gobert S. Chretien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). After transfection, Epo-sensitive cells were maintained in α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 units/ml Epo. Cells were grown with 3% WEHI as source of growth factor and metabolically labeled with [3H]ethanolamine (1.5 μCi/ml) or [3H]glucosamine (5 μCi/ml) for 20 h prior to assay. Four hours before the end of this period, cells were starved of growth factor in α-MEM containing 1% (v/v) of fetal calf serum. Cells were then washed twice with α medium, 25 mm HEPES, and aliquots of 10–20 × 106 cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min before stimulation with 5 units/ml Epo for 0–30 min. Incubations were stopped with HClO4 (5% v/v). After centrifugation at 1200 × g, pellets and supernatants were stored at −20 °C before GPI and IPG quantitations. Lipids were extracted from the resultant pellets and analyzed by sequential acid/base silica gel thin layer chromatography (TLC, Silica Gel 60, Merck) as described previously (14Mato J.M. Kelly K.L. Abler A. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2131-2137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by HPTLC (Silica Gel 60 aluminum-backed HPTLC plates, Merck) developed in chloroform/methanol/NH4OH/water (45:45:3.5:10, v/v). HPTLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) and fluorographed on Kodak XAR-5 film. To quantitate incorporation of radiolabel into GPI, HPTLC plates were either scanned before fluorography on a Berthold LB 2821 automatic TLC linear analyzer, or 1-cm bands of TLC were scraped and their radioactivity content estimated by scintillation counting. IPG levels from perchlorate supernatants or from the aqueous phase obtained after GPI hydrolysis were determined by chromatography on a Dowex AG 1-X8 (200–400 mesh) column as described previously (13Saltiel A.R. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5793-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Devemy E. Billat C. Sartelet H. Martiny L. Haye B. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A sample of [3H]GPI from WT Epo-R FDC-P1 cells recovered after the basic thin layer chromatography was incubated in 25 mm sodium acetate, 0.16 msodium nitrite, pH 3.5, for 5 h at 37 °C (9Ferguson M.A. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) or with 1 unit/ml PI-PLC from B. cereus in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C (36Gaulton G.N. Kelly K.L. Pawlowski J. Mato J.M. Jarett L. Cell. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Controls were done by incubating [3H]GPI with buffer alone. Reaction was terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol (1:2), and the amount of radioactivity released in the aqueous phase after lipid extraction was determined. Results were expressed as the percentage of recovered radioactivity. Hydrolysis of purified [3H]GPI from WT FDC-P1 cells by mammalian PLC-γ2 was determined by incubation of Epo-activated PLC-γ2 from WT FDC-P1 cells bound on 2.5 mg of protein G beads or with PLC-γ2 from FDC-P1 ZERO obtained from a PLC-γ2 immunoprecipitation with 15 × 106 cells, in 250 μl of HEPES 25 mm, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C. Control was done by incubation of [3H]GPI with 2.5 mg of protein G beads in 250 μl of HEPES 25 mm, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted with the same protocol as above. Then, [3H]GPI contained in the organic phase was reanalyzed by HPTLC and quantitated on Berthold analyzer before fluorography. IPG contained in the aqueous phase was quantitated as described previously (13Saltiel A.R. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Then the deaminated glycan was reduced with sodium borotritide and subjected to solvolysis in 0.5m methanolic HCl for 12 h at 80 °C as described previously (37Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4245-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates developed for 10 cm in 1-propanol/acetone/water (9:6:5, v/v) (38Schneider P. Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. Fergusson M.A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and were scanned on a Berthold analyzer. 2,5-[3H]Anhydromannitol control was prepared by treating [3H]glucosamine as above. Starved FDC-P1 cells expressing the WT and mutant Epo-R were incubated with or without Epo (5 units/ml) for 1–10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized at 2 × 107cells/ml with 1% Brij 98 in solubilized buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmNa2VO4, pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitations were done as described previously (5Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with either anti-PLC-γ2 or anti-JAK2 antibodies. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to protean nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked, incubated with anti-PY antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody before adding ECL substrate solution and exposing to Kodak X-Omat film. When necessary, blots were stripped by incubating the membrane for 30 min at 55 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS. Then the blot was washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and reprobed as described previously. GPI identification was done with cells metabolically labeled for 20 h with [3H]ethanolamine, a radiolabeled precursor of GPI. Polar lipids were then extracted and resolved by sequential acid/base thin layer chromatography (TLC) or by HPTLC. During the first acid TLC, GPI did not migrate and was clearly separated from phosphatidylethanolamine which migrated at 9 cm (not shown). The material around the origin (2 cm) was recovered and analyzed on a second TLC or on HPTLC which was run in an alkaline solvant system. As shown in Fig. 2,A–C, a single peak of [3H]glycolipidic fraction was recovered between phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP). The same fraction was also labeled in extracts from WT Epo-R FDC-P1 cells incubated with [3H]inositol or [3H]glucosamine instead of [3H]ethanolamine (not shown). Characterization of GPI was confirmed by testing the sensitivity of the radiolabeled product to several GPI-hydrolyzing conditions. The recovered [3H]ethanolamine glycolipid fraction was first treated with nitrous acid that hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond between inositol and glucosamine. After deamination by nitrous acid, about 65% of the labeled material was recovered in the aqueous phase, and 10.5% of the radioactivity was recovered in the aqueous phase in control incubations. Moreover, we have shown 2,5-[3H]anhydromannitol production after having deaminated/reduced and methanolyzed the recovered [3H]glucosamine glycolipid fraction (Fig.3, A–C). We further investigated the cleavage of the purified recovered3H-labeled lipidic peak from WT Epo receptor-transfected FDC-P1 cells by PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from B. cereus. After treatment, about 21% of the labeled material was recovered in the aqueous phase versus control 5%. These values are in good agreement with previously published results showing the sensitivity of GPI from various tissues to B. cereusPI-PLC (24Villalba M. Alvarez J.F. Russell D.S. Mato J.M. Rosen O.M. Growth Factors. 1990; 2: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Eardley D.D. Koshland M.E. Science. 1991; 251: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Altogether, our results show that the lipidic products extracted from FDC-P1 WT Epo receptor-transfected cells and migrating between PIP and PC corresponded to GPI. GPI hydrolysis was assessed by measuring both GPI or inositol phosphate glycan (IPG) levels (its hydrolysis product) from cells metabolically labeled with [3H]ethanolamine. Epo (5 units/ml) induced a rapid and transient GPI hydrolysis with a parallel IPG release within 1 min in FDC-P1 cells transfected with WT Epo-R. Then the IPG level rapidly decreased and returned to control values after 30 min of Epo exposure. No GPI hydrolysis was detected after Epo stimulation of non-transfected FDC-P1 cells (Fig.4). To assay the possible involvement of PLC-γ2 in Epo-induced GPI hydrolysis, we first investigated its tyrosine phosphorylation in WT Epo-R FDC-P1 cells upon Epo stimulation. As shown in Fig.5 A, Epo induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 142-kDa protein immunoprecipitated with anti-PLC-γ2 antibodies. This effect was maximal after 1–2 min of Epo stimulation and then decreased after 5 min of stimulation. Reprobing the blot with anti-PLC-γ2antibodies confirmed that the 142-kDa protein was indeed PLC-γ2. Epo-induced PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation was dose-dependent as shown in Fig.5 B and the Epo effect was maximal at 0.1 units/ml. In order to know whether tyrosine residues of the Epo-R play a significant role in Epo-induced PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation, we used interleukin-3-dependent FDC-P1 cells transfected with the wild-type (WT) Epo-R and with Epo-R devoid of tyrosine residue (ZERO) (Fig. 1). Then, cells were stimulated for 1 min with Epo 5 units/ml. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLC-γ2 antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, in contrast to FDC-P1 cells expressing WT Epo-R, Epo did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 in FDC-P1 cells ZERO, suggesting that the tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain of the Epo-R were required for Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2. Reprobing the blot with anti-PLC-γ2antibodies showed that the same amounts of PLC-γ2 had been immunoprecipitated from each sample. Moreover, JAK2 immunoprecipitations carried on the same cellular extracts followed by an anti-phosphotyrosine blot showed that these cells were stimulated by Epo. PLC-γ2 immunoprecipitations from FDC-P1 cells expressing various Epo-R mutants were achieved after Epo stimulation. As shown in Fig. 7, PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation was found to occur in mutants Y1, F1Y2, F1Y5–8, and in Y1–2F3–4Y5–8 upon Epo stimulation. It was more important in Y1–2F3–4Y5–8 FDC-P1 cells than in WT FDC-P1 cells. In F1Y3–4 and Y1–6 FDC-P1 cells, an inhibition of PLC-γ2tyrosine phosphorylation was seen after Epo stimulation. It was probably due to the presence of Tyr428–431 which inhibited PLC-γ2 phosphorylation. This hypothesis was confirmed by the enhanced PLC-γ2 activation observed in Epo-stimulated Y1–2F3–4Y5–8 FDC-P1 cells. Altogether, our results suggest that Tyr343, Tyr401, and Tyr464 and/or Tyr479are involved in PLC-γ2 activation, whereas Tyr429 and/or Tyr431 reduced this PLC-γ2 activation. Treatment of recovered [3H]GPI with Epo-activated PLC-γ2bound on protein G beads from immunoprecipitates of WT or ZERO-FDC-P1 cells resulted in an hydrolysis of about 50.2 and 9.8%, respectively (Fig. 8 A). Analysis of the resultant products showed a greater IPG content released in the aqueous phase in samples treated with Epo-activated PLC-γ2 from WT FDC-P1 cells than from ZERO FDC-P1 cells (Fig. 8 A). To the contrary, analysis of [3H]GPI remaining in the organic phase is greater in sample hydrolyzed with Epo-activated PLC-γ2 from ZERO FDC-P1 than from WT FDC-P1 cells (Fig.8, B and C). This demonstrated that PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation is required for GPI hydrolysis. Moreover, as described previously, Epo induced a rapid IPG release within 1 min in FDC-P1 cells transfected with WT Epo-R, and no change of IPG levels was observed in FDC-P1 cells ZERO after Epo stimulation (Fig. 9). IPG levels were also determined upon Epo stimulation (5 units/ml, 1 min) in metabolically labeled FDC-P1 cells expressing various Epo-R mutants. These experiments show an excellent correlation between Epo-induced PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation and Epo-induced GPI hydrolysis. Indeed, after Epo stimulation, IPG levels were increased in Y1 and in F1Y2 mutants which only retains a single tyrosine at positions 343 and 401, respectively. These cells differ from FDC-P1 ZERO by only one tyrosine. Nevertheless, IPG level in Y1 or Y2 mutants was about half the level obtained in WT-Epo-R FDC-P1 transfected cells. IPG level was greatly increased after Epo stimulation in F1Y5–8 mutant, but IPG increase was also lower than in WT-Epo-R FDC-P1 transfected cells. In Y1–2F3–4Y5–8, IPG level obtained after Epo stimulation was greater than in WT-Epo-R FDC-P1-transfected cells. In F1Y3–4 and Y1–6mutants, Epo induced an inhibition of IPG basal level (Fig. 9).Figure 9Epo-induced GPI hydrolysis in FDC-P1 cells transfected with various Epo-R mutants. FDC-P1 cells expressing either the wild-type Epo receptor or Epo-R mutants were labeled with [3H]ethanolamine (1.5 μCi/ml) for 20 h, deprived of growth factor for 4 h, and then stimulated for 1 min with 5 units/ml Epo (+) or with vehicle alone (−). IPG release was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in WT cells and Epo-R mutants. Data are the means of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our results show that FDC-P1 cells contain GPI molecules that are hydrolyzed to produce IPG after Epo stimulation. After TLC or HPTLC analysis, GPI migrated as a single peak between PC and PIP as described previously in Epo-sensitive cells (21Devemy E. Billat C. Sartelet H. Martiny L. Haye B. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and in other cells (14Mato J.M. Kelly K.L. Abler A. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2131-2137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The material of this peak exhibited all the characteristics of GPI. Indeed, it could be labeled with [3H]inositol and [3H]glucosamine in addition to [3H]ethanolamine. Moreover, the GPI structure of this lipid was confirmed by its partial sensitivity to PI-PLC from B. cereus and nitrous deamination of the free amino group on glucosamine. Presence of glucosamine in 3H-recovered glycolipidic fraction was also confirmed by 2,5-anhydromannitol obtained after deamination/reduction and methanolysis of this molecule. Altogether these results indicate that the labeled glycolipid fraction corresponds to GPI. It has been previously shown that GPI displays various degrees of sensitivity to bacterial PI-PLCs cleavage (14Mato J.M. Kelly K.L. Abler A. Jarett L. J. Biol.

Epo stimulation of Epo receptor-transfected FDC-P1 cells metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine induced the same level of GPI hydrolysis with release of water-soluble IPG forms. In contrast to GPI molecules involved in insulin signal transduction in H35 hepatoma cells which does not contain ethanolamine (14Mato J.M. Kelly K.L. Abler A. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2131-2137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mato J.M. Kelly K.L. Abler A. Jarett L. Corkey B.E. Cashel J.A. Zopf D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), our results show that GPI molecules containing ethanolamine are involved in Epo signal transduction. Bacterial PI-PLCs can partially mimic the effects of the extracellular ligand on GPI through the generation of diacylglycerol and IPG (13Saltiel A.R. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5793-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 41Macaulay S.L. Larkins R.G. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 42Vila M.C. Milligan G. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8735-8740Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the formation of IPG from GPI is due to the activation of a phospholipase C. A GPI-specific PLC has been purified and cloned from T. brucei (43Bulow R. Overath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11918-11923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and peanuts (44Bütikofer P. Brodbeck U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17794-17802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is able to hydrolyze GPI-anchored proteins and phosphatidylinositol. However, this enzyme is not active on free GPI phospholipids (45Jones D.R. Avila M.A. Sanz C. Varela-Nieto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A mammalian GPI-PLC has been partially purified from rat liver membranes (26Fox J.A. Soliz N.M. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2663-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) but has not been cloned. The presence of two different GPI-PLC activities has also been reported in brain membranes (46Fouchier F. Baltz T. Rougon G. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that Epo induced the hydrolysis of GPI through the activation of PLC-γ2. Indeed, PLC-γ2immunoprecipitated from Epo-stimulated FDC-P1 cells was able to hydrolyze GPI molecules purified from these cells. The time course of Epo-induced PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation displays a good parallelism with the kinetics of Epo-induced GPI hydrolysis. Moreover, we observed a full correlation between the ability for mutated Epo receptors to activate PLC-γ2 and to induce IPG release. PLC-γ2 is expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells (47Noh D.-Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In FDC-P1 cells, macrophage-colony-stimulating factor induces activation of PLC-γ2 and its tyrosine phosphorylation (34Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.-L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that Epo stimulation of WT FDC-P1 cells induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of PLC-γ2 since maximal tyrosine phosphorylation was detected between 1 and 2 min and decreased after this time. Although Epo-induced PLC-γ2 has not been previously reported, it has been shown that Epo activates PLC-γ1 in the UT-7 human cell line (33Ren H.-Y. Komatsu N. Shimizu R. Okada K. Miura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19633-19638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of PLC-γ1 activation by Epo was not reported. Our results indicate that the tyrosine residues of the Epo receptor are involved in the activation of PLC-γ2. Indeed, Epo receptors devoid of tyrosine residue on their intracellular domain did not activate PLC-γ2. In contrast, Epo induced the activation of PLC-γ2 in FDC-P1 cells expressing Epo receptors with either the first (Tyr343) or second tyrosine (Tyr401) residue albeit to a reduced level compared with cells expressing normal Epo receptors. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the main activation site for PLC-γ2 is located in the C-terminal part of the receptor, suggesting that the seventh or eighth tyrosine residue could be involved in this activation. Yet, we could not show that PLC-γ2 is associated with the activated Epo-R and coimmunoprecipitate with it as for PLC-γ1 in UT7/Epo cells (33Ren H.-Y. Komatsu N. Shimizu R. Okada K. Miura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19633-19638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was probably due to the rapid dissociation of the SH2 domains of PLC-γ2from the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of the Epo receptor (48Rhee S.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 297-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Previous results have indicated that an intact tyrosine kinase activity is required for GPI hydrolysis in response to growth factors in Chinese hamster ovary cells carrying normal human insulin receptors. These cells hydrolyze up to 70% of their GPI within 2 min after the addition of 0.1 nm insulin, whereas cells expressing a mutant cDNA (Lys-1018 to Ala) that encodes a receptor lacking kinase activity (49Chou C.K. Dull T.J. Russell D.S. Gherzi R. Lebwohl D. Ullrich A. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1842-1847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) hydrolyzes only 20–30% in response to insulin (24Villalba M. Alvarez J.F. Russell D.S. Mato J.M. Rosen O.M. Growth Factors. 1990; 2: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, Clemente et al. (23Clemente R. Jones D.R. Ochoa P. Romero G. Mato J.M. Varela-Nieto I. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) had indicated that tyrosine kinase inhibitors partially block GPI hydrolysis in parallel to the inhibition of both EGF receptor autophosphorylation and EGF-induced cell proliferation. Our results also indicate that the tyrosine residues Tyr429and/or Tyr431 are involved in deactivation of PLC-γ2 phosphorylation and in GPI hydrolysis inhibition. Indeed, Epo-induced PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation and GPI hydrolysis in mutants F1Y3–4 are lower than in controls without Epo but are greater in mutants Y1–2F3–4Y5–8 (deprived of Tyr429 and Tyr431) than in WT FDC-P1 cells. Then tyrosines Tyr429 and/or Tyr431 appear to be negative regulators of GPI hydrolysis. The Tyr429 was identified as the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 in the cytoplasmic domain of the Epo-R (50Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that PLC-γ2 could be a substrate for Epo-activated SHP1. The levels of cell surface expression of Epo-R have been already published for the cell lines used in this study (35Gobert S. Chretien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) except for the mutant Y1–2F3–4Y5–8 which expressed 880 ± 50 Epo receptors. Most Epo-R mutants used in our experiments have been previously shown to be able to mediate Epo-induced Stat5 activation (35Gobert S. Chretien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ZERO Epo-R mutant which did not activate Stat5 (35Gobert S. Chretien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) mediates Epo-induced JAK2 activation (Fig. 6). These results show that all Epo-R mutants used in our experiments were activated by Epo. Although the levels of the cell surface expression are not identical, it should be noted that in WT FDC-P1 cells which expressed about 2100 Epo receptors or in Y1–2F3–4 Y5–8, we could detect a good level of phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 and GPI hydrolysis, whereas in mutant ZERO (without tyrosine residue) or in F1Y3–4 which expressed about 5700 and 7700 Epo receptors, respectively, we could not observe any PLC-γ2activation nor any GPI hydrolysis. From our results, we conclude that the levels of both Epo receptors are not correlated to GPI hydrolysis. A low level of PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation in immunoprecipitates of control cells was often observed. Nevertheless, no tyrosine phosphorylation of the Epo receptor was observed in these cells (not shown). This low level of PLC-γ2 could be attributed to unidentified molecules present in the fetal calf serum required to maintain cell survival during Epo starvation. The GPI/IPG pathway in Epo signal transduction has already been described in rat erythroid progenitor cells. Erythropoietin-stimulation of these cells increases GPI hydrolysis with a parallel increase in IPG levels, and purified erythroid rat IPG partially mimicked Epo-proliferative effects on erythroid colonies (21Devemy E. Billat C. Sartelet H. Martiny L. Haye B. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have also shown that IPG induced Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44 form) activation, and we also suggested that protein kinase C could be involved in this activation (51Devemy E. Billat C. Haye B. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Data presented here suggest a direct link between Epo receptor tyrosine phosphorylation leading to activation of PLC-γ2 and GPI hydrolysis and provide complementary information on the GPI/IPG pathway in Epo-proliferative effects. We thanks Marie-Line Sowa for excellent technical work."

The logarithm of the alcohol concentrations to achieve half-maximal PKC stimulation (ED50) and of the maximal PKC stimulation by alcohols were both linear functions of alcohol chain length, consistent with the Meyer-Overton effect. Binding of phorbol esters to PKC was not significantly affected by octanol. Octanol increased, up to 4-fold, the affinity of PKC binding to the lipid bilayers in both the absence and presence of DO. However, octanol increased PKC activity much more significantly than it enhanced binding of the enzyme to the lipid bilayers, suggesting that the stimulation of PKC is not merely a reflection of the increase in PKC bilayer binding affinity. 31P NMR experiments did not reveal formation of non-lamellar phases with octanol. Differential scanning calorimetry suggested that alcohols, like diacylglycerol, induce formation of compositionally distinct domains and the maximal enzyme activity with alcohol resided roughly in the putative domain-coexistence region. These results suggest that alcohols are mimicking diacylglycerol in activating PKC, not by binding to the high affinity phorbol ester binding site, but by altering lipid structure and by enhancing PKC-bilayer binding.

Kamaya H. Anesth. Analg. 1984; 63: 929-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). A common feature of anesthetic action is the modulation of electrical signaling which is accomplished by altering membrane conductance through ion channels or ion channel-linked receptors (3Hille B. Fink B.R. Progress in Anesthesiology, Vol. 2: Molecular Mechanism of Anesthesia. Raven Press, New York1980: 1-5Google Scholar). Two general hypotheses are proposed to account for the anesthetic actions on these membrane-associated protein systems (1Ueda I. Kamaya H. Anesth. Analg. 1984; 63: 929-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Hille B. Fink B.R. Progress in Anesthesiology, Vol. 2: Molecular Mechanism of Anesthesia.

The protein binding hypothesis argues that anesthetics bind directly to hydrophobic regions of specific protein receptors. The membrane perturbation hypothesis argues that anesthetics alter physical properties of the membrane that are necessary for the normal operation of various membrane-associated proteins. Protein kinase C (PKC)1phosphorylates and regulates many of the membrane proteins that have been implicated in pathways affected by anesthetics (5Shearman M.S. Sekiguchi K. Nishizuka Y. Pharmacol.

Moreover, PKC requires amphipathic molecules like diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS) as cofactors that may activate PKC by both direct binding and by altering the physical properties of the membrane. Many anesthetics are amphipathic molecules which have been proposed to bind to PKC at certain sites (10Slater S.J. Cox K.J. Lombardi J.V. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. Nature. 1993; 364: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) as well as to perturb the lipids in the bilayer (3Hille B. Fink B.R. Progress in Anesthesiology, Vol. 2: Molecular Mechanism of Anesthesia. Raven Press, New York1980: 1-5Google Scholar). Thus PKC is a potential target of anesthetic action and a model protein for testing both the protein binding hypothesis and the membrane perturbation hypothesis. PKC is a family of membrane-associated, serine/threonine kinases present in all tissues and especially abundant in the central nervous system (13Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). The PKC family consists of at least 11 isozymes which require negatively charged phospholipids (among which PS is much more effective than others), and for some of them, DAG and Ca2+to achieve full activation (14Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters can replace the DAG requirement (15Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the enzymes can be activated in a lipid-independent manner by protamine sulfate. While the role of cofactors in the PKC activation process is not clearly understood, a variety of studies has argued that physical properties of the lipid bilayers are important for the activation mechanism (16Sando J.J. Maurer M.C. Bolen E.J. Grisham C.M. Cell. Signal. 1992; 4: 595-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The physical properties of lipid bilayers that are most important in PKC activation have not been elucidated. Those that have been suggested include lateral heterogeneity or domain formation (17Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7961-7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Yang L.

J. 1994; 66: 382-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The surface potential of lipid bilayers also can influence activation by, for example, sequestering Ca2+ on the membrane surface (24Trudell J.R. Costa A.K. Csernansky C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Moris M.E. McLaughlin S. Lester D. Epand R.M. Protein Kinase C, Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Hills Horwood Limited, Chichester, England1992: 157-180Google Scholar). Since anesthetics can alter many of these membrane properties (12Trudell J.R. Costa A.K. Hubbell W.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 625: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Ho C. Kelly M.B. Stubbs C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Bottner M.

Acta. 1991; 1067: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is our working hypothesis that anesthetics affect PKC activity, at least in part, by their effects on membrane physical properties, and that the anesthetic-modulated enzyme directly or indirectly regulates the ion channels involved in anesthesia. Effects of anesthetics on PKC activation have been noted since the early 1980s (29Mori T. Takai Y. Minakuchi R. Yu B. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8378-8380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism of and even the direction of the effects have remained elusive. Lester and Baumann (30Lester D.S. Baumann D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 206: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated stimulation of PKC by alcohols in the presence of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) vesicles (30Lester D.S. Baumann D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 206: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hemmings and Adamo (31Hemmings H.C.J. Adamo A.I. Anesthesiology. 1994; 81: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) noted that varying anesthetic effects could be obtained in different lipid systems. Slater et al. (32Slater S.J.

Furthermore, the effects of the n-alcohols on lipid-associated PKCα activity differ markedly depending on whether the activity is induced by diacylglycerol or phorbol ester and are dependent upon n-alcohol chain length (10Slater S.J.

We have examined the effects of several alcohol anesthetics on PKC activity and membrane binding in characterized lipid systems that support PKC activity and mimic many features of the cellular membrane. The saturated lipids DMPC and DMPS were used in this study so that the phase behavior of these defined lipid binary and ternary systems at various alcohol concentrations could be studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). More physiological unsaturated lipid systems also were examined and similar effects were observed. The modulation of PKC activity by alcohols appears to be associated with alcohol effects on lipid structure, possibly via the induction of lateral heterogeneity or domain formation. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylserine (DMPS), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylserine (DPPS), 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylserine (POPS), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (DO), and dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (dansyl-PE) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). All of the lipids were greater than 99% pure as determined by thin-layer chromatography on Adsorbosil-Plus plates from Alltech Associates, Inc. (Deerfield, IL) using the solvent systems described previously (19Dibble A.R. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1877-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MOPS, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, and EGTA were Chemika grade and the magnesium chloride was puriss grade from Fluka Chemical Corp. (Ronkonkoma, NY). [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). [20-3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (10–20 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Lysine-rich histone (type III-s), ATP, and phorbol esters were from Sigma. Octanol, heptanol, hexanol, pentanol, and butanol were also from Sigma. Chloroform, methanol, and benzene were high performance liquid chromatography grade from Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA). Grace's culture medium, yeastolate, lactalbumin, and fetal calf serum for culture of Sf9 insect cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Sf9 insect cells (∼2 × 106 cells/ml in spinner culture) were infected with a PKCα baculovirus expression construct kindly provided by Drs. P. Parker, S. Stabel, and D. Fabbro. Infected cells were harvested when the viability dropped to approximately 85%. PKCα was purified from the cytosol by sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose columns, both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Enzyme concentration was determined by assay of phorbol ester binding as described previously (33Sando J.J. Young M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2642-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and enzyme purity was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and Western blotting using PKCα-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz. CA). The purified PKCα was then stored in 30% glycerol and 20 mmMOPS at −75 °C. Enzyme was thawed and diluted with MOPS/KCl buffer just prior to the kinase assays. The enzyme remained 90% intact after incubation for 1 h at 35 °C as described previously (19Dibble A.R. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1877-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The concentration of lipid stock solutions in chloroform was periodically determined by phosphate assay as described previously (34Morrison W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 7: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Phospholipids and DO stored in chloroform were mixed together at the desired molar ratios and dried thoroughly under nitrogen then under vacuum for at least 1 h. The lipids were then lyophilized from benzene/methanol (19/1, v/v) for a minimum of 12 h in the dark. Each dried sample was hydrated in 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 100 μm EGTA, pH 7.2 (MOPS/KCl buffer). Each sample was vortexed extensively above the main transition temperature for 20 min to make multilamellar vesicle (MLVs) dispersions. MLVs were subsequently extruded using a hand microextruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) to make large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), as described (19Dibble A.R. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1877-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All lipid vesicles were stored in the dark under an argon atmosphere at room temperature. Kinase activity was assessed by the ability of the enzyme to incorporate [γ-32P]ATP into histone. The reaction mixture (75 μl total) contained 5 mm MgCl2, 300 μm CaCl2, 0.2 mg/ml lysine-rich histone, 40 μm ATP spiked with [γ-32P]ATP to 1.6–3.7 Ci/mmol, 5 nm PKCα, 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 100 μm EGTA, pH 7.2, 1 mmlipids, and alcohols at concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was terminated after 4 min at 35 °C, 5–7 min at 30 °C, or 1 h at 4 °C by spotting 60 μl of the reaction mixture onto Whatman P-81 ion exchange paper (Whatman International, Maidstone, United Kingdom). The papers were washed three times in 50 mm NaCl to remove unreacted ATP and then dried. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by measuring the Cerenkov radiation on a Beckman scintillation counter. Phorbol ester binding was assessed by the ability of [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) to bind to PKCα. The reaction mixture (75 μl total) contained 5 mm MgCl2, 300 μm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 nm[20-3H]PDBu, MOPS/KCl buffer, 5 nm PKC, 1 mm lipids, with 1.5 μm non-labeled PDBu or 0.15% ethanol vehicle, and alcohols at concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was conducted for 5 min at 30 °C or 1 h at 4 °C, and bound [20-3H]PDBu was separated from free PDBu by rapid passage through Whatman 934-AH glass fiber filters. The filters were washed 3 times with iced phosphate-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl, 8.3 mm NaHPO4, 1.4 mm NaH2PO4), and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. The specific binding of PDB to PKC was calculated as the difference between binding in the presence and absence of excess unlabeled PDB. Affinity of PKC binding to the lipid bilayers was estimated using fluorescence energy transfer from tryptophans in PKC to a dansyl-PE probe with a SLM 8100 fluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL), as modified from Bazzi and Nelsestuen (35Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The excitation and the emission wavelengths were 283 and 510 nm, respectively. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing PC/PS/DO and 2 mol % dansyl-PE at various lipid concentrations were incubated with 33 or 67 nm PKC. The experiments were carried out in the same buffer as in the PKC activity assay but histone and ATP were omitted. MLVs (20 mm total lipid) were prepared with hydrating buffer containing 50% (v/v) D2O. After a minimum of 2 days of hydration, each sample was transferred to a 10-mm diameter NMR tube (Wilmad Glass Co., Buena, NJ). Proton-decoupled free induction decays were collected at 30 °C using a Varion 500 Unity Plus spectrometer operating at 202.4 MHz with the following instrument settings: sweep width, 30 kHz; pulse width, 20 μs; acquisition time, 0.41 s; receiver delay, 0.65 s; number of transients, 10,800. An exponential multiplication corresponding to line broadening of 10 Hz was applied to the accumulated free induction decays before Fourier transformation. Excess heat capacity measurements of lipid and lipid-alcohol dispersions (1.4 ml of 5 mm total lipid) were performed on a MicroCal MC-2 (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) differential scanning calorimeter at a nominal scan rate of 10 °C/h. The experimental data were analyzed with the MicroCal's Origin graphic software program. Partition coefficients of alcohols in DMPC/DMPS/DO systems were determined by injection titration calorimetry (36Zhang F. Rowe E.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and by measuring the depression of the gel-fluid transition temperature (37Kaminoh Y. Tashiro C. Kamaya H. Ueda I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), as described elsewhere. Injection titration calorimetry was performed on a MicroCal Omega calorimeter. Solvent blanks or lipids (5 mm) combined with alcohol were injected into alcohol solutions at 35 or 4 °C with an injection volume of 30 μl for a duration of 20 s. The syringe spin rate was 300 rpm. The free alcohol concentration in an alcohol-lipid-water suspension was determined by a solvent null method, heat is absorbed (released) if the free alcohol concentration in the cell is higher (lower) than that in the suspension; when the concentration in the cell matches the free concentration in the suspension, no heat is generated upon mixing. The freezing point depression method was used to obtain the difference between the partition coefficients of the alcohol into lipids in the fluid and gel state, using the transition temperature shift induced by alcohol. The relationship between the difference of partition coefficients and the shift of the phase transition temperature is, 1Tm*−1Tm=R×(Kp,f−Kp,g)×Xa,wΔHoEquation 1 where T m and T m* are the transition temperatures in the absence and presence of alcohol, respectively, K p,f and K p,g are the mole fraction partition coefficients of the alcohol in fluid and gel state lipids, respectively; R is the gas constant; ΔH° is the enthalpy per mole of lipid that undergoes a gel to fluid phase transition in the absence of alcohols;X a,w is the mole fraction of alcohol in the aqueous solution at T m*. The effect of alcohols on PKC activation was examined first in DMPC/DMPS/DO ((80-X)/20/X). PKC activity increased from 0 to 25–30 mol % DO and decreased above 30 mol % DO (data not shown). Addition of alcohols to this lipid system increased PKC activity (Fig. 1). In the presence of 15 and 25 mol % DO, alcohols activated PKC synergistically with DO until maximal enzyme activity was achieved. With shorter chain alcohols, PKC activation decreased significantly at higher alcohol concentrations (Fig. 1, D and E). Even in the absence of DO, high concentrations of alcohols activated PKC. With longer chain alcohols (Fig. 1, A-C), this activation was greater than that achieved with 25 mol % DO, which maximally activated PKC in the absence of alcohol (see above). The alcohol concentration to achieve half-maximal stimulation of PKC activity (ED50) correlated quantitatively with the chain length of the alcohol (Fig.2 A), with the longer chain alcohols requiring lower concentrations for half-maximal activation of PKC. For each alcohol, the ED50 was smaller in the presence of DO than in the absence of DO, but the slope of the log ED50 versus chain length appeared to be invariant. Since the alcohol chain length correlates linearly with the logarithm of alcohol partition coefficient between lipids and buffer, a quantitative correlation between the ED50 and the partition coefficient of alcohols was obtained as expected (inset of Fig. 2 A). A similar correlation was obtained between the alcohol chain length and the maximal alcohol-enhanced PKC activity, defined as the fold stimulation of maximal PKC activity with alcohol over that with 25 mol % DO without alcohol (Fig. 2 B). The maximal alcohol-enhanced PKC activity was greater with higher DO concentrations for individual alcohols, but maximal PKC activity appeared to increase with alcohol chain length more rapidly at lower DO concentrations, as indicated by the increase of the slope when DO mol % was decreased (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether the phospholipid composition, like the DO mol %, affected alcohol activation of PKC, we examined two additional lipid systems. DPPC/DPPS/DO was selected because this system is similar to DMPC/DMPS/DO with saturated acyl chains on the phospholipids, but it provides a gel state environment because its gel-liquid crystalline phase transition occurs at temperatures higher than the PKC activity assay temperature (30 °C). POPC/POPS/DO was selected because this system contains lipids with saturated and unsaturated acyl chains that are similar to cell membrane lipids and exist in the fluid state under our assay conditions. It also has been shown to activate more effectively than DMPC/DMPS/DO at low DO concentrations (20Bolen E.J. Sando J.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5945-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This system also supports PKC-phorbol ester binding which will be utilized in later experiments whereas neither of the saturated phospholipid systems (DMPC/DMPS or DPPC/DPPS) supports significant phorbol ester binding. We selected octanol as a representative alcohol to use with the two lipid systems because it was the most potent alcohol in stimulating PKC activity in the DMPC/DMPS/DO system. DPPC/DPPS/DO and POPC/POPS/DO were first characterized for PKC activating ability at various concentrations of DO from 0 to 25 mol % (data not shown). DPPC/DPPS/DO supported PKC activity with increasing DO from 0 to 10 mol %, with maximal PKC activity maintained until 20 mol %. PKC activity decreased when DO was higher than 20 mol %. POPC/POPS/DO required much less DO (1 mol %) to maximally activate PKC, similar to the fully unsaturated DOPC/DOPS/DO system studied previously (20Bolen E.J. Sando J.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5945-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The enzyme was nearly inactive at 0 mol % DO, then was activated linearly from 0 to 1 mol % DO, and maintained maximal activity from 1 to 25 mol % DO (data not shown). Addition of octanol to the DPPC/DPPS/DO system enhanced PKC activity similarly to that in DMPC/DMPS/DO (cf. Fig. 1 Aand Fig. 3 A). In the presence of 15 or 25 mol % DO, low concentrations of octanol stimulated PKC activity significantly and synergistically with DO. The stimulation was maximal at 2.5 mm octanol and decreased at higher octanol concentration. As with the DMPC/DMPS system, high octanol concentrations activated PKC in the DPPC/DPPS system in the absence of DO. However, a higher octanol concentration was required to obtain the onset of PKC stimulation in the DPPC/DPPS system in the absence of DO (∼2.5 mm octanol for DPPC/DPPS versus ∼1 mm octanol for the DMPC/DMPS system). In the POPC/POPS/DO system (Fig. 3 B), PKC activity increased with octanol concentration and did not seem to reach a maximum as observed with the DMPC/DMPS/DO and DPPC/DPPS/DO systems. In both the absence and presence of DO, even the lowest octanol concentrations caused significant increases in PKC activity. The presence of DO provided a small increase in the enzyme activity, but did not alter the dependence of PKC activation on octanol. The synergistic effect of DO and octanol on maximal PKC activation was not as prominent as with the saturated lipid systems. The effects of alcohols on PKC activation are similar to those of DAG in three respects. First, in the saturated lipid system higher alcohol or DAG concentration is required to significantly activate PKC. Second, the enzyme activity exhibits a maximum as a function of alcohol or DAG concentration. Third, in the unsaturated lipid system much lower concentrations of either alcohol or DAG are required to activate PKC. The observation that alcohols activate PKC in the absence of DO raised the possibility that alcohols might activate PKC by interacting with the binding sites for DO on the enzyme, presumably the cysteine-rich domains which also bind phorbol esters with high affinity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of octanol on the binding of phorbol esters to PKC. In POPC/POPS (50/50) MLVs, PDBu bound to 5 nm PKC with an apparent dissociation binding constant (K d) of about 20 nm (Fig. 4 A). We had to reduce the concentration of POPC from 80 to 50 mol % because we found that the nonspecific binding of PDBu to the membrane was greatly enhanced when POPC is greater than 70% (data not shown). High concentrations of octanol (1 and 2 mm) did not have inhibitory effects on the binding over a range of PDBu concentrations up to 10-fold the apparent K d (Fig. 4 A). Instead, octanol appeared to slightly enhance maximal PDB binding to PKC. To further investigate this enhancement, a series of octanol concentrations were applied to POPC/POPS (50/50) with 75 nmPDBu, under which conditions the high affinity phorbol ester-binding site of PKC was essentially saturated. No significant effect on the degree of PDB-PKC binding was observed (Fig. 4 B). Theinset of Fig. 4 shows that octanol activated PKC over this alcohol concentration range in this POPC/POPS (50/50) system as it did in POPC/POPS (80/20) (Fig. 3). Similar results were found in the presence of 5 mol % DO (POPC/POPS/DO (45/50/5)) with dramatic activation of PKC by octanol but with no effect on PDB binding to PKC (data not shown). PKC-α has a putative second phorbol ester-binding site with a K d at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that for the high affinity binding site (38Slater S.J. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Larkin J.D.
