https://openalex.org/W1971304382,"CNS white matter from higher vertebrates and cultured differentiated oligodendrocytes are nonpermissive substrates for neurite growth and fibroblast spreading. Membrane proteins of 35 kd and 250 kd with highly nonpermissive substrate properties could be extracted from CNS myelin fractions. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against these proteins: IN-1 and IN-2 bound both to the 35 kd and 250 kd inhibitors and to the surface to differentiated cultured oligodendrocytes. Adsorption of nonpermissive CNS myelin or nonpermissive oligodendrocytes with either antibody markedly improved their substrate properties. Optic nerve explants injected with IN-1 or IN-2 allowed axon ingrowth of cocultured sensory and sympathetic neurons. We conclude that the nonpermissive substrate properties of CNS white matter are due to these membrane proteins on the surface of differentiated oligodendrocytes and to their in vivo product, myelin."
https://openalex.org/W2076450755,"The identification of surface proteins restricted to subsets of embryonic axons and growth cones may provide information on the mechanisms underlying axon fasciculation and pathway selection in the vertebrate nervous system. We describe here the characterization of a 135 kd cell surface glycoprotein, TAG-1, that is expressed transiently on subsets of embryonic spinal cord axons and growth cones. TAG-1 is immunochemically distinct from the cell adhesion molecules N-CAM and L1 (NILE) and is expressed on commissural and motor neurons over the period of initial axon extension. Moreover, TAG-1 and L1 appear to be segregated on different segments of the same embryonic spinal axons. These observations provide evidence that axonal guidance and pathway selection in vertebrates may be regulated in part by the transient and selective expression of distinct surface glycoproteins on subsets of developing neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2078146089,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the development and survival of sympathetic and neural crest-derived sensory neurons. The mechanism of action of NGF has been extensively studied in the NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12. When treated with NGF, PC12 cells initiate neurite outgrowth and differentiate into cells with a neuronal phenotype. This process is prevented by RNA synthesis inhibitors. NGFI-B is a gene, identified by differential hybridization, that is rapidly, but transiently induced in PC12 cells by NGF. The nucleotide sequence of the NGFI-B gene was determined, and it encodes a 61 kd protein with strong homologies to members of the glucocorticoid receptor gene family. The two regions of homology between NGFI-B and this family of ligand-dependent transcriptional activators are the region corresponding to the DNA-binding domain and the region comprising the ligand-binding domain near the COOH-terminus. NGFI-B, as a possible ligand-dependent transcriptional activator induced by NGF, may play a role in initiating NGF-induced differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2062652610,"Xenopus embryos injected with tritiated thymidine throughout the stages of embryonic retinal neurogenesis showed that more than 95% of the embryonic retinal cells are born within a 25 hr period. While there are shallow central to peripheral, dorsal to ventral, and interlaminar gradients of neurogenesis in these eyes, throughout most of this 25 hr period, postmitotic cells are being added to all sectors and layers. Small clones of differentiated retinal neurons and glia derived from single neuroepithelial cells injected with HRP. These clones were elongated radially. They were also composed of many different combinations of cell types, suggesting a mechanism whereby determination is arbitrarily and independently assigned to postmitotic cells. Such a model, when tested statistically, fits our data very well. We present a scheme for cellular determination in the Xenopus retina in which a coherent group of clonally related cells stretch out radially as lamination begins. This brings different cells into different microenvironments. Local interactions in these microenvironments then lead the cells toward specific fates."

https://openalex.org/W1999922759,"Many adhesive interactions are mediated by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences within adhesive proteins. Such RGD sequences are frequently recognized by structurally related heterodimers that are members of the integrin family of adhesion receptors. A region was found in the platelet RGD receptor, gpIIb/IIIa, to which an RGD peptide becomes chemically cross-linked. This region corresponds to residues 109 to 171 of gpIIIa. This segment is conserved among the beta subunits of the integrins (76 percent identity of sequence), indicating that it may play a role in the adhesive functions of this family of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1997605512,"Studies of the biology and pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) have been hampered by the inability to maintain long-term cultures of KS cells in vitro. In this study AIDS-KS-derived cells with characteristic spindle-like morphology were cultured with a growth factor (or factors) released by CD4+ T lymphocytes infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type I or II (HTLV-I or HTLV-II) or with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV-1 or HIV-2). Medium conditioned by HTLV-II-infected, transformed lines of T cells (HTLV-II CM) contained large amounts of this growth activity and also supported the temporary growth of normal vascular endothelial cells, but not fibroblasts. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α stimulated the growth of the KS-derived cells, but the growth was only transient and these factors could be distinguished from that in HTLV-II CM. Other known endothelial cell growth promoting factors, such as acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and epidermal growth factor, did not support the long-term growth of the AIDS-KS cells. The factor released by CD4+ T cells infected with human retroviruses should prove useful in studies of the pathogenesis of KS."
https://openalex.org/W2055178533,"A new subunit, beta 2, of the neuronal nicotinic receptor family has been identified. This subunit has the structural features of a non-agonist-binding subunit. We provide evidence that beta 2 can substitute for the muscle beta 1 subunit to form a functional nicotinic receptor in Xenopus oocytes. Expression studies performed in oocytes have demonstrated that three different neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can be formed by the pairwise injection of beta 2 mRNA and each of the neuronal alpha subunit mRNAs. The beta 2 gene is expressed in PC12 cells and in areas of the central nervous system where the alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 4 genes are expressed. These results lead us to propose that the nervous system expresses diverse forms of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by combining beta 2 subunits with different agonist-binding alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2054093997,"We are studying how axons branch in vivo. Individual cortical neurons send axons to both the spinal cord and the basilar pons. Here we show that the corticopontine projection develops by an interstitial budding of collaterals from parent axons rather than a reported mechanism of axon branching, growth cone bifurcation. This mechanism is used regardless of whether the parent axon's postpontine segment, which forms the corticospinal projection, is permanent (motor cortex) or transient (visual cortex). Budding occurs days after the parent axons grow spinally past the pons, accounting for the “waiting period” reported in this system in contrast to an alternative explanation that the growth cones pause outside of their target. Timing and location of pontine collateral budding vary with cortical origin of the parent axon and are correlated with the temporal ordering of axon arrival."
https://openalex.org/W1480365149,"The lymphokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) rapidly increases the levels of mRNA encoding nerve growth factor (NGF) in primary cultures of fibroblasts isolated from adult rat sciatic nerves. The effect of IL-1 on NGF-mRNA was not inhibited by cycloheximide, which itself increased the NGF-mRNA. From the blocking ability of actinomycin D, it was deduced that the IL-1 action depends on continuous RNA synthesis and that the half-life of NGF-mRNA is about 90 min. Nuclear run-on studies showed that, although IL-1 enhances the low basic NGF-mRNA transcription, the main effect of IL-1 results from stabilization of the NGF-mRNA. In addition, indirect evidence is presented indicating that the IL-1 effect of NGF-mRNA levels involves activation of phospholipase A2."
https://openalex.org/W1896529685,"Interleukin 1 (IL 1) inhibits the growth of human melanoma A375 cells (1). To identify the subcellular events preceding inhibition of growth by IL 1, we have examined the effect of IL 1 on protein synthesis caused by A375 cells. IL 1 selectively and predominantly induced a 25-kDa polypeptide (p25) in A375 cells after 12 h. On subcellular fractionation, p25 was exclusively located in the 10,000 x g-pelleted (mitochondria-enriched) fraction. To identify the p25 moiety, it was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and reverse-phase, high-pressure liquid chromatography and its amino-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. The sequence of the 35 amino-terminal amino acids of the p25 moiety was identical to that of human manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD) (2). The enzymatic activities of SOD were induced only in the mitochondria-enriched fraction of IL 1-treated A375 cells. However, IL 1 also induced Mn SOD in normal human skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whose growth was stimulated by IL 1. The results show that induction of Mn SOD by IL 1 is a common biochemical event in IL 1-responsive cells.—Masuda, A.; Longo, D. L.; Kobayashi, Y.; Appella, E.; Oppenheim, J. J.; Matsushima, K. Induction of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase by interleukin 1. FASEB J. 2: 3087-3091; 1988."

https://openalex.org/W2038674593,"We used specific antibodies to gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits to characterize acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in extracts and at endplates of developing, adult, and denervated rat muscle. The AChRs in normal adult muscle were immunoprecipitated by anti-epsilon and anti-delta, but not by anti-gamma antibodies, whereas AChRs in denervated and embryonic muscles were precipitated by anti-gamma and anti-delta, but showed little or no reactivity to anti-epsilon antibodies. In immunofluorescence experiments, AChRs at neonatal endplates bound antibodies to gamma or delta, but not epsilon, subunit, whereas those in adult muscles bound antibodies to epsilon or delta, but not gamma, subunit. AChRs at denervated endplates and at developing endplates between postnatal days 9 and 16 bound all three antibodies. We conclude that the distribution of gamma and epsilon subunits of the AChR parallels the distribution of AChRs with embryonic and adult channel properties, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2081843209,"An overlap between subpopulations of nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive and capsaicin-sensitive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons has been suggested from a number of in vivo studies. To examine this apparent link in more detail, we compared the effects of capsaicin on adult rat DRG neurons cultured in the presence or absence of NGF. Capsaicin sensitivity was assessed histochemically by a cobalt staining method, by measuring capsaicin-induced 45Ca2+ uptake, and by electrophysiological recording of capsaicin-evoked membrane currents. When cultured with NGF, approximately 50% of these adult DRG neurons were capsaicin-sensitive, whereas adult sympathetic neurons or ganglionic nonneuronal cells were insensitive. DRG cultures grown in the absence of NGF, however, were essentially unresponsive to capsaicin. Capsaicin sensitivity could be regained fully within 4-6 days of replacement of NGF. These results indicate that, at least in vitro, NGF can modify the capsaicin sensitivity of adult DRG neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1562752364,"Intact and proteolytically modified human serpins, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and C1 inhibitor, were compared by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and resistance against unfolding by guanidine HCl. The modified proteins were prepared from the intact and active inhibitors by selective proteolytic cleavage in their reactive site loops and tested for complete loss of activity. Significant differences in the spectral properties between intact and modified inhibitors indicate that a major conformational rearrangement is triggered by the cleavage. This leads to a large increase in conformational stability as demonstrated by large shifts of the transition profiles recorded as a function of guanidine HCl concentration at 20 degrees C by circular dichroism at 220 nm. Intact inhibitors were unfolded in two steps of about equal size centered at 0.8-1.7 and 2.5-3.5 M concentrations of the denaturant, respectively. Under identical conditions modified inhibitors are completely stable, and their denaturation occurs only well above 4 M guanidine HCl in one or two steep transition steps. From the similarity of the spectral changes and shifts in transition profiles for all four serpins studied it is concluded that the conformational changes and stabilization triggered by the modification hit is an important common mechanistic feature of this class of inhibitors. This is supported by the observation that ovalbumin, which is homologous with the serpins but apparently lacks inhibitory activity, exhibits neither spectral changes nor a significant change in stability upon proteolytic modification."
https://openalex.org/W1977329952,"We have purified a 9 amino acid amidated neuropeptide, DPKQDFMRFamide, from whole adult D. melanogaster. This peptide exhibits sequence homology to the molluscan bioactive tetrapeptide FMRFamide and is a novel member of the FMRFamide peptide family. The gene encoding DPKQDFMRFamide has been cloned and characterized. It is present in a single copy per haploid genome, is expressed as a unique 1.7 kb mRNA species, and cytologically maps to 46C on the right arm of chromosome 2. Characterization of a cDNA clone indicates that the precursor protein is 347 amino acids in length and contains 5 copies of DPKQDFMRFamide, as well as 10 additional amidated peptides exhibiting varying degrees of structural relatedness. The Drosophila DPKQDFMRFamide gene and the Aplysia FMRFamide gene are ancestrally related; however, peptides display a higher degree of homology within a species than between species, suggesting intragenic concerted evolution of these neuropeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1483809793,"Synthesis of type I and III collagens has been examined in MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells after treatment with the steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). Analysis of total [3H]proline-labeled proteins and pepsin-derived collagens revealed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 selectively stimulated synthesis of alpha 1I and alpha 2I components of type I collagen after 6-12 h. Consistent with previous reports (Franceschi, R. T., Linson, C. J., Peter, T. C., and Romano, P. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4165-4171), parallel increases in fibronectin synthesis were also observed. Hormonal effects were maximal (2- to 2.5-fold versus controls) after 24 h and persisted for at least 48 h. In contrast, synthesis of the alpha 1III component of type III collagen was not appreciably affected by hormone treatment. Of several vitamin D metabolites (1,25-(OH)2D3, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) tested for activity in stimulating type I collagen synthesis, 1,25-(OH)2D3 was found to be the most active. Analysis of collagen mRNA abundance by Northern blot hybridization indicated that both types I and III procollagen mRNAs were increased 4-fold after a 24-h exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Pro alpha 1I mRNA remained elevated through the 48-h time point while pro alpha 2I and pro alpha 1III mRNAs returned to control values. These results indicate that the regulation of collagen synthesis by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is complex and may involve changes in translational efficiency as well as mRNA abundance. 1,25-(OH)2D3 also caused at least a 20-fold increase in levels of the bone-specific calcium-binding protein, osteocalcin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that 1,25-(OH)2D3 is stimulating partial differentiation to the osteoblast phenotype in MG-63 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1517422587,"We have studied the mRNA accumulation of pim and myb genes in two interleukin 2- (IL2-)dependent, CTLL-2 and B6.1, and one IL3-dependent, FDC-P2, murine hematopoietic cell lines. To be able to dissociate the IL2 response from the phenomenon of lymphocyte activation, we used cell lines constitutively expressing the high affinity IL2 receptor. Deprivation of IL2 for 16 h led to an accumulation of CTLL-2 cells in G0/G1, and stimulation with IL2 induced a progression in S phase after 10 h. An increased accumulation of pim mRNA was observed in all cases in response to IL2 or IL3. This regulation did not require de novo protein synthesis and was, in CTLL-2 cells, mostly at the transcriptional level. Expression of myb was more complex: in CTLL-2 and FDC-P2 it is high and constitutive, while in B6.1 it is low and induced by IL2. This difference in myb regulation correlates with the higher level of myb expression in immature cells, as only B6.1 is functionally mature. Furthermore, it shows that transcription of myb does not affect the control of the cell cycle by the growth factors IL2 and IL3. These studies demonstrate that pim belongs to the small group of protooncogenes that can be induced during the primary response to growth factors (fos, myc, and myb) and that constitutive expression of myb, at least at the RNA level, is not sufficient to abrogate the growth factor requirement of hematopoietic cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2054092941,"GAP-43 is a growth cone protein expressed in neurons especially during periods of axonal elongation. Poor repair in the adult mammalian CNS has been ascribed to restraints upon its expression. We have cloned human GAP-43 cDNA to investigate its potential involvement in neurological illness. Analysis of postmortem human brain tissue disclosed uniformly high expression of GAP-43 throughout the neonatal brain, whereas in the adult brain high levels of GAP-43 persist only in discrete regions. However, in the wake of ischemic injury in the adult brain, regions normally low in GAP-43 reexpress it at high levels, suggesting a role for GAP-43 in remodeling and repair of mature CNS neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2018349527,"Transgenic mouse lineages were established that carry the normal (M) or mutant (Z) alleles of the human alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-Pi) gene. All of the alpha 1-Pi transgenic mice expressed the human protein in the liver, cartilage, gut, kidneys, lymphoid macrophages, and thymus. The human M-allele protein was secreted normally into the serum. However, the human Z-allele protein accumulated in several cell types, but particularly in hepatocytes, and was found in serum in tenfold lower concentrations than the M-allele protein. Mice in one lineage carrying the mutant Z allele expressed high levels of human alpha 1-Pi RNA and displayed significant runting (50% of normal weight) in the neonatal period. This lineage was found to have alpha 1-Pi-induced liver pathology in the neonatal period, concomitant with the accumulation of human Z protein in diastase-resistant cytoplasmic globules that could be revealed in the Periodic acid-Schiff reaction (PAS). The phenotype of mice in the strain expressing high levels of the Z allele is remarkably similar to human neonatal hepatitis, and this strain may prove to be a useful animal model for studying this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2087890962,"In C. elegans, the newly identified ace-3 is the third gene affecting acetylcholinesterase (ACNE) activity. ace-3 II specifically affects class C ACNE and is unlinked to ace-1 X or ace-2 I, which affect the other two AChE classes (A and B, respectively). Strains homozygous for an ace-3 mutation have no apparent behavioral or developmental defect; ace-1 ace-3 and ace-2 ace-3 double mutants are also nearly wild type. In contrast, ace-1 ace-2 ace-3 triple mutant animals are paralyzed and developmentally arrested; their embryonic development is relatively unimpaired, but they are unable to grow beyond the hatching stage. Based on the analysis of genetic mosaics, we conclude that in the absence of ace-2 and ace-3 function, the expression of ace-1(+) in muscle cells, but not in neurons, is essential for postembryonic viability."
https://openalex.org/W1493308665,"In the present report we describe the isolation of a functional domain of platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib which retains von Willebrand factor (vWF)-binding activity. Glycocalicin, a proteolytic fragment of the alpha-chain of GP Ib generated by an endogenous calcium-activated protease, was submitted to digestion with trypsin. The two resulting fragments, one of 45 kDa extending between residues His1 and Arg293 and representing the amino terminus of the alpha-chain, the other of 84 kDa corresponding to the previously described macroglycopeptide, were purified to homogeneity. Glycocalicin, as well as the 45- and 84-kDa fragments, inhibited the ristocetin-dependent binding of native vWF to platelet GP Ib. The concentration inhibiting 50% of binding (IC50) was between 1 and 5 microM with all these molecules. In contrast, the binding of asialo-vWF to platelet GP Ib, measured directly in the absence of ristocetin, was blocked by glycocalicin and the 45-kDa fragment with a similar IC50, but not by the 84-kDa fragment. Both glycocalicin and the 45-kDa fragment bound to purified surface-bound vWF in a ristocetin-dependent manner and with similar affinities. Monoclonal antibodies against vWF or GP Ib inhibited this interaction in a way consistent with their inhibition of vWF binding to platelet GP Ib. These studies demonstrate that the amino-terminal extracytoplasmic region of the alpha-chain, extending between residues 1 and 293, contains a functional domain that interacts with vWF in the absence of any other structure of the GP Ib complex or any other platelet membrane component. Whereas the ristocetin-dependent binding of vWF may involve also other domains in the macroglycopeptide region, the direct vWF-GP Ib interaction appears to be mediated only by a domain in the amino-terminal region of GP Ib alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1568373312,"We have cloned and sequenced two barley alpha-amylase genes belonging to the high pI isozyme family, one of which, Amy6-4, corresponds to a cDNA previously characterized by our laboratory. A 750-base pair probe from Amy6-4, representing primarily the promoter/upstream sequences cross-hybridizes on genomic Southern blots under stringent conditions to five other genes or pseudogenes; this demonstrates that the promoter/upstream region in these different members of the gene family is highly conserved. In contrast, this probe hybridizes very poorly to the genomic fragment containing the other cloned high pI gene, Amy46, a finding consistent with substantial divergence of sequence about 200 base pairs upstream from the TATA box of each. We compared steady-state mRNA levels from these individual genes to levels for mRNAs from two low pI alpha-amylase genes and from the single copy gene for aleurain, a thiol protease, using quantitative S1 nuclease protection assays. We found, in RNA from aleurone cells treated with gibberellic acid for 19-24 h, that the two low pI alpha-amylase mRNAs are each about five times more abundant than Amy6-4 or aleurain, which are, in turn, about 10 times more abundant than Amy46. These results indicate that as many as seven closely related high pI genes are needed to provide mRNA levels approaching those from the two low pI genes. We speculate that the substantially lower level of expression of Amy46 may be related to its divergent sequence upstream from the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1542481208,"In this paper we outline a flexible and rapid method to measure picogram quantities of isotype-specific immunoglobulin (Ig), including IgE. Only readily or commercially available reagents are required: isotypespecific, anti-human Ig murine monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to coat microtiter plates, polyclonal alkaline phosphatase-coupled isotype-specific F(ab)‘2 or Fab’ fragments as second antibodies, and an enhanced developing system that amplifies the signal-to-noise ratio of the quantitatively bound second antibody. The procedure is detailed in the appendix to enable easy application, even if one has no previous experience with ELISAs. This system can be used to detect less than 10 picograms of Ig in cultures supernatants of cells that contain mixtures of various Igs and it can be used to detect the product of a single cell producing Ig. This method also will be applicable to measurement of the minute quantities of lymphokines and other biologically active molecules produced in vitro and found in various fluids in vivo.—Macy, E.; Kemeny, M.; Saxon, A.

https://openalex.org/W1485490040,"A low molecular weight serine protease inhibitor, named trypstatin, was purified from rat peritoneal mast cells. It is a single polypeptide with 61 amino acid residues and an Mr of 6610. Trypstatin markedly inhibits blood coagulation factor Xa (Ki = 1.2 x 10(-10) M) and tryptase (Ki = 3.6 x 10(-10) M) from rat mast cells, which have activities that convert prothrombin to thrombin. It also inhibits porcine pancreatic trypsin (Ki = 1.4 x 10(-8) M) and chymase (Ki = 2.4 x 10(-8) M) from rat mast cells, but not papain, alpha-thrombin, or porcine pancreatic elastase. Trypstatin forms a complex in a molar ratio of 1:1 with trypsin and one subunit of tryptase. The complete amino acid sequence of this inhibitor was determined and compared with those of Kunitz-type inhibitors. Trypstatin has a high degree of sequence homology with human and bovine inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors, A4(751) Alzheimer's disease amyloid protein precursor, and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. However, unlike other known Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, it inhibits factor Xa most strongly."
https://openalex.org/W1595694860,"Bradykinin gave a biphasic increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in serum-deprived Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts loaded with the photoprotein aequorin. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) alone did not increase [Ca2+]i, but when added after bradykinin there was an increase in [Ca2+]i. The EGF-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i was maximal at 3 min and disappeared with a half-life of 6 min after bradykinin. Removing Ca2+ from the external medium did not abolish either the bradykinin or the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i responses. Although prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha also gave [Ca2+]i responses and permitted an EGF-dependent [Ca2+]i response, the effect of bradykinin did not appear to be mediated by prostaglandins since it was not blocked by indomethacin. Vasopressin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate both gave a [Ca2+]i response but did not facilitate a [Ca2+]i response by EGF. Bradykinin or EGF alone did not increase DNA synthesis in growth-arrested Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, but EGF added together with, or after, bradykinin increased DNA synthesis. The effect disappeared with a half-life of 180 min after the addition of bradykinin. It is concluded that stimulation of receptor protein tyrosine kinase is unlikely, by itself, to explain the increase in DNA synthesis produced by EGF. The observed increase in [Ca2+]i caused by EGF after bradykinin probably reflects the interaction of intracellular second messenger pathways leading to facilitation of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1622556758,"Abstract The ability of the intermediate filament subunit protein vimentin to bind synthetic oligonucleotide telomere models containing repeat sequences from Oxytricha (T4G4), Saccharomyces (TGTGTG3), or Tetrahymena (T2G4) was investigated in vitro with a filter binding assay and a gel overlay assay. At low ionic strength, vimentin bound these oligonucleotides with high affinity. At higher ionic strength, the vimentin-oligonucleotide complex was less stable, such that approximately 30% of the initial binding remained at 150 mM KCl. One mole of vimentin tetramer bound approximately 1 mol of telomere oligonucleotide. Vimentin bound well oligonucleotides containing either a random duplex or random 3'-overhang, but showed a reduced affinity for a blunt-ended oligonucleotide. A control random sequence oligonucleotide was not bound by vimentin. The oligonucleotide-binding site of vimentin was shown to be localized in the non-alpha-helical N-terminal domain by assays employing purified proteolytic fragments of vimentin. Preliminary results in the gel overlay assay show that other members of the intermediate filament family, nuclear lamins A-C, all bind the synthetic oligonucleotide containing the telomere repeat sequence of Oxytricha."
https://openalex.org/W1496688565,"The developmental expression of adrenocortical steroid hydroxylases was studied in bovine fetuses from 40 to 280 days gestational age. The expression of P-450(17 alpha) is first detected at a gestational age of 50 days and reaches a maximum at 60-70 days. The expression of P-450(17 alpha) then declines and is nondetectable at a gestational age of 100 days. P-450(17 alpha) is not expressed again until about 240 days, i.e. shortly before birth (approximately 280 days). P-450scc, P-450c21, P-450(11 beta) and adrenodoxin were present in fetal adrenals throughout gestation. This on-off-on pattern of P-450(17 alpha) expression during fetal development was associated with a corresponding episodic production of cortisol. Immunoreactive corticotropin (ACTH) levels in fetal plasma were elevated in small fetuses (corresponding to less than or equal to 100 days) and in near-term fetuses (corresponding to greater than 250 days) compared with those in mid-gestation fetuses. In primary culture, adrenal cells from mid-gestation fetuses contained no detectable P-450(17 alpha) but rapidly responded to ACTH with an increase in P-450(17 alpha) protein and mRNA. The tissue specificity of the developmental patterns is emphasized by the fact that both P-450(17 alpha) and P-450scc were detectable throughout the development of the fetal testes, whereas only P-450scc was detectable in fetal bovine ovary prior to 200 days. Thus, in fetal bovine adrenal it appears that ACTH is the major regulatory factor effecting the intermittent presence of P-450(17 alpha), whereas the presence of the other steroid hydroxylases is either regulated by additional factors or shows a much different sensitivity to ACTH."
https://openalex.org/W1597846236,"Complementary DNAs (cDNA) encoding the brain and non-brain forms of the human clathrin light chains LCa and LCb have been isolated, sequenced, and compared with their homologues in cow and rat. The significant differences that distinguish LCa from LCb and the brain from non-brain forms show remarkable preservation in all three species. These features include the position and sequence of the brain-specific inserts, a totally conserved region of 22 residues near the amino terminus, the LCb-specific phosphorylation site, the heavy chain binding site, and a distinctive pattern of cysteine residues near the carboxyl terminus. Unorthodox sequences for translation initiation and polyadenylation are found for LCb contrasting with LCa which exhibits orthodox regulatory sequences. Small insertions in human LCa revealed a duplicated sequence of 13 residues that flank the 22-residue conserved region. Only the carboxyl-terminal copy of this sequence is present in LCb. All sequences are consistent with the heavy chain binding site comprising an alpha-helical central region of the light chains. The hydrophobic face of this helix, which is presumed to interact with the heavy chain, is highly conserved between LCa and LCb, whereas the hydrophilic face shows considerable divergence. To help define the carboxyl-terminal limit of the heavy chain binding region, the epitope recognized by the CVC.6 monoclonal antibody was localized to residues 192-208 of LCa with glutamic acid 198 being of most importance. The faithful preservation of clathrin light chain polymorphism in three mammalian species provides evidence supporting a functional diversification of the brain and non-brain forms of LCa and LCb."
https://openalex.org/W1578052592,"The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induces a unique secretory protein (LM) in the salivary glands of developing and adult rats. In order to study the regulation of growth and gene expression by catecholamines, we have isolated and sequenced several cDNA clones encoding the LM protein. Each of the LM cDNA clones described identifies, by Northern blot analyses, a single mRNA species of approximately 900 bases in size. The mRNA encoding this secreted protein was not detected in submandibular glands or brains of untreated adult rats. Sequence analyses of the LM cDNA clones revealed a striking similarity to the family 2 of cysteine proteinase inhibitors. Furthermore, when purified LM protein was used to assay for inhibition of cysteine proteinases, the data demonstrated that it is indeed a type of cysteine proteinase inhibitor. This inhibitor, termed rat cystatin S, provides the first example of cysteine proteinase inhibitors that can be induced by beta-adrenergic agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1588337995,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), an intracellular second messenger produced from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, interacts with cytoplasmic membrane structures to elicit the release of stored Ca2+. Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ mobilization is mediated through high affinity receptor binding sites; however, the biochemical mechanism coupling receptor occupation with Ca2+ channel opening has not been identified. In studies presented here, we examined the effects of naphthalenesulfonamide calmodulin antagonists, W7 and W13, and a new selective antagonist, CGS 9343B, on Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by Ins(1,4,5)P3 in neoplastic rat liver epithelial (261B) cells. Intact fura-2 loaded cells stimulated by thrombin, a physiological agent that causes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and Ins (1,4,5)P3 release, responded with a rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ levels that was dose dependently inhibited by W7(Ki = 25 microM), W13 (Ki = 45 microM), and CGS 9343B (Ki = 110 microM). Intracellular Ca2+ release stimulated by the addition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 directly to electropermeabilized 261B cells was similarly inhibited by pretreatment with anti-calmodulin agents. W7 and CGS 9343B, which potently blocked Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, had no significant effect on protein kinase A or C in dose range required for complete inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization. Ca2+ release channels and Ca2+-ATPase pump activity were also unaffected by calmodulin antagonist treatment. These results indicate that calmodulin is tightly associated with the intracellular membrane mechanism coupling Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors to Ca2+ release channels"
https://openalex.org/W1603379750,"Expression of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) in human mononuclear phagocytes may provide a local mechanism for inactivation of serine proteases at sites of tissue injury, thereby preventing incidental damage to surrounding tissue and allowing for orderly initiation of repair. We have previously shown that serine (neutrophilic or pancreatic) elastase and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) each mediate an increase in the expression of alpha 1-PI in human peripheral blood monocytes and bronchoalveolar macrophages. In this study we demonstrate that elastase and LPS have an additive positive regulatory effect on alpha 1-PI expression. Distinct pretranslational and translational mechanisms of action for elastase and LPS, respectively, account for the additive effect. The possibility that translational regulation of alpha 1-PI by LPS involves a mechanism analogous to that of the yeast gene GCN4 during amino acid starvation and that of the human ferritin gene in response to iron is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2137129539,"Synthetic peptides derived from the beta 1 domain of HLA-DR antigens containing RFDS and a peptide derived from the immunoglobulin-like amino-terminal domain of CD4 and containing RADS were shown to exhibit specific dose-dependent inhibitory effects on antigen-induced HLA class II-restricted T-cell proliferation and in vitro antibody synthesis. These inhibitory activities are similar to those exhibited by anti-CD4 and HLA-DR antibodies, respectively. The peptides derived from HLA-DR or CD4 and anti-CD4 or anti-HLA-DR antibodies acted together in synergy to inhibit these responses when the relevant cell populations were incubated with infrainhibitory concentrations of the reagents. In contrast, these peptides were shown to exert no inhibitory activity on nonspecific T-cell activation mediated by ionomycin, phorbol myristate acetate, and interleukin-2."
https://openalex.org/W1985890015,Several new synthetic agents show high affinity for binding adenine derivatives. The structures feature complementary hydrogen bonds that cause the molecular chelation of the purine nucleus. The high lipophilicity of the new agents permits the transport of adenosine and deoxyadenosine across organic liquid membranes. The use of synthetic receptors for small biological targets may have application in drug delivery.
https://openalex.org/W2010890636,"The sixth segmental ganglion in the ventral nerve cord of the leech H. medicinalis contains a bilateral pair of rostral penile evertor motor neurons (RPEs) that in the adult innervate the male genitalia. During embryogenesis, the RPEs extend numerous extraganglionic projections. Only two of these innervate the target and are normally retained in the adult, while the others retract. Early, but not late, removal of the male genitalia results in the indefinite retention and continued growth of projections that would normally retract. Any of these projections can innervate targets transplanted to ectopic locations. We conclude that an RPE motor neuron requires a signal, provided by its interaction with the target organ during a critical period, in order to stop extending axons, stabilize those axons that contact the target, and retract those that do not."
https://openalex.org/W1503025822,"Sequential stimulation and washout procedures were employed to examine the kinetics and reversibility of pharmacologically manipulated second messenger signals mediating phenotypic changes and proliferative activation of resting human T lymphocytes. Phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) was used to stimulate protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) while ionomycin was used to manipulate intracellular Ca2+ levels. Stimulation by PDBu alone induced phosphorylation of several endogenous substrates and altered expression of phenotypic markers, downregulating expression of CD4 and CD3 while increasing expression of CD2 and the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor. Stimulation with ionomycin alone caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels but did not induce proliferation or cause major changes in the expression of phenotypic markers (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, IL-2, and transferrin receptors). Analysis of endogenous PDBu stimulated phosphosubstrates indicated that some substrates (pp92, pp82, pp55) underwent dephosphorylation, returning to base-line levels following PDBu removal while others (pp61, pp65) showed only partial dephosphorylation, while one (pp28) remained phosphorylated. Washing ionomycin-stimulated cells resulted in an approximately 75% reduction of intracellular Ca2+. Ionomycin exposure did not alter the affinity (KD = 22.3 +/- 7.4 nM) or number of receptors (53,497 +/- 8,291 receptors/cell) for [3H]PDBu. These data suggest that signals induced by PDBu or ionomycin are reversible following removal of the stimulating agents with respect to proliferative activation of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, a transcriptional mechanism regulating the production of IL-2 mRNA requires simultaneous activation of protein kinase C and elevation of intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1673028275,"Intracellular protein degradation in perfused livers of fed rats has been shown to be directly regulated by 7 amino acids (Leu, Tyr, Gln, Pro, Met, His, and Trp) and co-regulated by alanine. Responses to graded increases of regulatory amino acids (individually or combined) are multiphasic and include (a) an initial inhibition at 0.5 times normal plasma concentrations, (b) a localized, zonal loss of inhibition at normal levels, and (c) suppression to basal rates at 4 times normal concentrations or greater; the zonal loss of inhibition is prevented by 0.5 mM (normal) alanine. In further perfusion studies carried out at the usual time (1100 h), we have occasionally observed a sharp decrease in proteolytic responsiveness at normal amino acid concentrations. The decrease, which occurred spontaneously in normal fed rats, was attributed to a nearly 90% loss in the sensitivity of alanine co-regulation. In all instances, alanine sensitivity was restored after 4 to 24 h of starvation. The cause of the insensitivity and the mechanism of its reversal by caloric deprivation are not presently known. Starvation for 24 h also appeared to alter the individual inhibitory effectiveness of Leu, Tyr, and Gln. On the other hand, inhibition by the full regulatory group at 4 times normal plasma levels was unchanged when compared with the complete plasma mixture except for a concentration shift in the peak zonal loss of proteolytic inhibition from 1.25 to 0.6 times plasma levels. Since the shift paralleled known changes in portal vein regulatory amino acids, it may have been adaptive in nature. As with fed animals, the zonal loss in starvation was abolished by 0.5 mM alanine, but not with high levels of lactate and pyruvate (10 mM), a finding consistent with the view that co-regulation is mediated by the recognition of alanine per se rather than its metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2092065785,"Cerebella, variably deficient in Purkinje cells, were obtained from aggregation chimeras of either Lurcher or Purkinje cell degeneration mutants. These cerebella were used to analyze the expression of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) in Bergmann glia. Immunocytochemistry showed apparently normal GPDH expression only in Bergmann glia in the immediate vicinity of surviving Purkinje cells. The number of GPDH-positive Bergmann glia cells associated with isolated Purkinje cells was close to that expected, based on measurements in Golgi-stained, normal cerebella of the Bergmann glia cell's domain. The results support the hypothesis that GPDH expression in Bergmann glia cells depends upon their sustained interaction with Purkinje cells, most likely involving direct cell-cell contact."
https://openalex.org/W1562644239,"The chemical coupling of diphtheria toxin to an antimurine Thy1 antibody resulted in the most efficacious immunotoxin to date. At 1 micrograms/ml the immunotoxin inhibited protein synthesis of a Thy+ AKR murine cell at a rate of 1.4 logs/h, within the order of magnitude of the efficacy of native toxins. This is unusual since murine cells are highly resistant to diphtheria toxin. The conjugate is highly specific; Thy- AKR cells display no intoxication at 1 microgram/ml even after 18 h. The effects of ammonia, acid pulsing of external media, and low temperature reveal some similarities and some differences between intoxication of sensitive cells by toxin and of murine cells by the antibody-toxin conjugate. The differences that result in the high efficacy of the antibody-toxin conjugate appear to result from the antibody-mediated routing. These results imply that murine cells possess an acidic compartment which can mediate toxin cytosolic entry. Unlike the Thy antigen, the toxin receptor on murine cells is unable to route the toxin to this cellular site."
https://openalex.org/W1500765560,"The primary sequences of five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs A-E) which bind with various affinities (Kd = 4-810 nM) to the D-2 dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol, have been determined. Immunoglobulin light and heavy chain mRNA was isolated and gene sequence determined by primer extension in the presence of dideoxynucleotides. The pattern of insertions and deletions found within the hypervariable regions produce loops which differ in length from one antibody to another, and are directly responsible for establishing the gross architecture of the combining site. Two of the anti-haloperidol mAbs have long hypervariable loops which form a pocket-shaped combining site. Three other mAbs have deletions of 3 or 4 amino acids in the third heavy chain complementarity producing region which result in a groove-like combining site as determined by computer based molecular modeling. A discussion of the probable mechanism by which the given sequences were generated from various gene segments is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1970516054,"Ionic selectivity characteristics of the K+ channel from the sarcoplasmic reticulum were studied as a function of temperature in order to decompose the profile of Gibbs free energy along the conduction pore into its enthalpic and entropic components. For Li+, Na+, K+, and Rb+, the enthalpy of binding to the channel is close to zero. Activation enthalpies for transferring ions from bulk aqueous solution to the channel's selectivity region are 20–25 kl/mol for Na+, K+, and Rb+ and substantially higher for Li+ and Cs+. Transfer of Li+ and Na+ to the selectivity region involved large favorable entropies. The results argue that the group IA cations shed about half their waters of hydration in permeating the selectivity region of this channel."
https://openalex.org/W1498681383,"Incubation of minced rat ventral prostate with 3'-deoxyadenosine (3'-dA) prior to labeling with the androgen, tritiated 7 alpha, 17 alpha-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone, reduced the level of androgen receptor bound to chromatin and increased the level of cytosolic androgen receptor and the fraction of cytosolic androgen receptor that did not bind to DNA. This effect was specific for 3'-dA and not mimicked by adenosine, 2'-deoxy-adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, or uridine. Adenosine was a competitive inhibitor of the 3'-dA effect. Labeled cytosolic androgen receptor from 3'-dA-treated prostate had properties that were similar to those exhibited by untransformed androgen receptor from prostate cytosol prepared in the presence of Na2MoO4, an inhibitor of receptor transformation in cell-free systems. Both androgen receptors had sedimentation coefficients of 8-9 S in low-salt gradients, did not bind to DNA tightly, and had a high affinity for DEAE-cellulose. The 3'-dA effect on these properties was not observed if androgen receptor from 3'-dA-treated prostate was isolated on high-salt gradients. These findings show that androgen receptor transformation does take place in intact prostate cells and suggest that 3'-dA inhibits chromatin binding of androgen receptor by interfering with androgen receptor transformation. The transformation process appears to involve removal of components from androgen receptor. Since 3'-dA is a potent inhibitor of the synthesis, polyadenylation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNA, the 3'-dA effect may indicate a role for RNA in the mechanism of receptor transformation in intact target cells."
