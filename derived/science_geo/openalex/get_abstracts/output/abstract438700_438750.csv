Beyond a role in energetic support, new evidence implicates nutrient-responsive metabolites as mediators of crosstalk between metabolic flux, cellular signaling, and epigenetic regulation of cell fate. Stem cell metabolism also offers a potential target for controlling tissue homeostasis and regeneration in aging and disease. In this Perspective, we cover recent progress establishing an emerging relationship between stem cell metabolism and cell fate control. Plasticity in energy metabolism allows stem cells to match the divergent demands of self-renewal and lineage specification. Beyond a role in energetic support, new evidence implicates nutrient-responsive metabolites as mediators of crosstalk between metabolic flux, cellular signaling, and epigenetic regulation of cell fate. Stem cell metabolism also offers a potential target for controlling tissue homeostasis and regeneration in aging and disease. In this Perspective, we cover recent progress establishing an emerging relationship between stem cell metabolism and cell fate control. Metabolism (from the Greek μεταβoλη´, i.e., transition, transformation) supports fundamental processes throughout life, as cells require a continuous yet adaptable energy supply to meet the demands of their specialized functions. Metabolic flexibility fuels divergent stem cell fates, which include quiescence to minimize stress damage, proliferation and self-renewal to maintain progenitor pools, and lineage specification for tissue regeneration. These vital processes are powered through the metabolism of energy substrates supplied by the environment, such as glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. Catabolism, the process of breaking down (oxidizing) metabolites to produce energy, and anabolism, the process of constructing macromolecules from precursors, are tightly balanced. As a result, catabolic products, including hydrocarbons and energy in the form of ATP and reducing cofactors, serve as substrates for the anabolic production of macromolecules that cannot be obtained from the environment. Beyond providing energetic supply, metabolic circuits engage master genetic programs in control of cell behavior (McKnight, 2010McKnight S.L. On getting there from here.Science. 2010; 330: 1338-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with cellular identity and functional state reflecting the specific metabolic pathways being used. This Perspective highlights the plasticity in stem cell metabolism, which enables prioritization of metabolic pathways to match anabolic and catabolic demands of evolving identities during cell fate determination. The one-cell embryo preferentially metabolizes pyruvate over glucose, extending the metabolic pattern of the oocyte (Figure 1). Initial oxidative metabolism in the embryo relies on abundant maternal mitochondria inherited from the oocyte. Early cell divisions in the preimplantation embryo result in discrete mitochondrial segregation, leading to reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number and density, as replication is initiated after implantation. This yields populations of progenitor cells with a spectrum of heteroplasmy, or mixture of healthy and mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondrial patterning allows blastomeres to purge metabolism-deficient progeny harboring disproportionally high levels of maternally derived mutant mtDNA, thus selecting for healthy metabolic profiles and preventing mutational meltdown in subsequent generations (Fan et al., 2008Fan W. Waymire K.G. Narula N. Li P. Rocher C. Coskun P.E. Vannan M.A. Narula J. Macgregor G.R. Wallace D.C. A mouse model of mitochondrial disease reveals germline selection against severe mtDNA mutations.Science. 2008; 319: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar; Shoubridge and Wai, 2008Shoubridge E.A. Wai T. Medicine. Sidestepping mutational meltdown.Science. 2008; 319: 914-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite their functional capacity to produce ATP from oxidative metabolism, mitochondria of oocytes and newly fertilized eggs are structurally undeveloped, consisting of spherical structures with truncated cristae that predominantly reside near the nucleus (Van Blerkom, 2009Van Blerkom J. Mitochondria in early mammalian development.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Glucose uptake gradually increases in the morula and is accelerated in the blastocyst stage where glucose uptake exceeds that of pyruvate or lactate and is predominantly metabolized through glycolysis (Johnson et al., 2003Johnson M.T. Mahmood S. Patel M.S. Intermediary metabolism and energetics during murine early embryogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31457-31460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Priming of the glycolytic system may occur in anticipation of implantation into the hypoxic uterine wall, as glucose uptake is further accelerated following implantation, where virtually all glucose is metabolized to lactate. During later development, mitochondrial replication, maturation into tubular cristae-dense structures, and cytosolic deployment enables reinitiation of oxidative metabolism and progressive decline in glycolysis (Johnson et al., 2003Johnson M.T. Mahmood S. Patel M.S. Intermediary metabolism and energetics during murine early embryogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31457-31460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Van Blerkom, 2009Van Blerkom J. Mitochondria in early mammalian development.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The chronology of metabolic regimes is underscored by embryonic phenotypes that reflect disrupted metabolic processes (Johnson et al., 2003Johnson M.T. Mahmood S. Patel M.S. Intermediary metabolism and energetics during murine early embryogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31457-31460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Glycolytic gene mutations precipitate early postimplantation lethality, while defects in oxidative processes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase mutations or genetic disruption of the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM, result in developmental delay and/or late onset lethality (Johnson et al., 2003Johnson M.T. Mahmood S. Patel M.S. Intermediary metabolism and energetics during murine early embryogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31457-31460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Larsson et al., 1998Larsson N.G. Wang J. Wilhelmsson H. Oldfors A. Rustin P. Lewandoski M. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Mitochondrial transcription factor A is necessary for mtDNA maintenance and embryogenesis in mice.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). The maturation of more efficient metabolic infrastructure during development has also been documented in highly specialized tissues. Cardiomyocytes from day 9.5 embryos (e9.5) contain few fragmented mitochondria with poorly defined and unorganized cristae, similar to those in the early embryo, which undergo extensive maturation into filamentous networks of elongated and branched mitochondria with abundant and organized cristae by day e13.5 (Hom et al., 2011Hom J.R. Quintanilla R.A. Hoffman D.L. de Mesy Bentley K.L. Molkentin J.D. Sheu S.S. Porter Jr., G.A. The permeability transition pore controls cardiac mitochondrial maturation and myocyte differentiation.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocyte development is dependent on mitochondrial status, as early induction of mitochondrial maturation accelerates cardiomyocyte differentiation, while differentiation is impaired when mitochondria are arrested in the immature state (Folmes et al., 2012bFolmes C.D.L. Dzeja P.P. Nelson T.J. Terzic A. Mitochondria in control of cell fate.Circ. Res. 2012; 110: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Hom et al., 2011Hom J.R. Quintanilla R.A. Hoffman D.L. de Mesy Bentley K.L. Molkentin J.D. Sheu S.S. Porter Jr., G.A. The permeability transition pore controls cardiac mitochondrial maturation and myocyte differentiation.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Progenitors in the developing retina are dependent on glycolytic flux from endogenous stores, such as glycogen, for proliferation and survival, while forced differentiation switches glycolysis into oxidative metabolism for ATP generation (Agathocleous et al., 2012Agathocleous M. Love N.K. Randlett O. Harris J.J. Liu J. Murray A.J. Harris W.A. Metabolic differentiation in the embryonic retina.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Metabolic plasticity thus enables flexibility in energetic substrate choice, which is critical for proper development. Different cell states require specific metabolic programs to support the unique bioenergetic demands underlying their specialized functions. Flexibility in metabolic pathway utilization maintains a balance of anabolic processes to support synthesis of cellular building blocks, and catabolic processes to ensure adequate bioenergetic resources. Metabolic requirements are defined by the energetic demands of stem cell proliferation, lineage specification, and quiescence. As such, metabolism at a stemness ground state is unable to fulfill the needs of differentiated progeny. Conversely, metabolic metamorphosis underlies pluripotent induction during nuclear reprogramming. Proliferating cells have a high requirement for not only reducing cofactors (NADPH) and energy (ATP), but also carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen to support biosynthesis of cell building blocks required for replication (Vander Heiden et al., 2009Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B. Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10144) Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 2012Zhang J. Nuebel E.

Complete consumption of available substrates cannot support their anabolic requirements. Rather, partial breakdown of glucose through glycolysis and shunting of intermediates through the pentose phosphate pathway provide a compromise between catabolic generation of ATP and reducing cofactors, and production of biosynthetic substrates to meet anabolic requirements (Figure 2). Indeed, increased expression of glycolytic enzymes and stimulation of glycolysis is required for cell immortalization and is sufficient to increase cellular lifespan (Kondoh et al., 2005Kondoh H. Lleonart M.E. Gil J. Wang J. Degan P. Peters G. Martinez D. Carnero A. Beach D. Glycolytic enzymes can modulate cellular life span.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar). Although glycolysis is inherently less efficient, producing a fraction of ATP compared to oxidative consumption of glucose, glycolysis does enable a fast rate of energy generation. Under abundant supply of glucose, the percentage of ATP generated from glycolysis can surpass that produced by oxygen-dependent respiration (Guppy et al., 1993Guppy M. Greiner E. Brand K. The role of the Crabtree effect and an endogenous fuel in the energy metabolism of resting and proliferating thymocytes.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As such, mitochondria may redirect away from oxidative ATP generation to cataplerosis, enabling extraction of partially oxidized substrates from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for biosynthetic purposes. Similar to the early embryo, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have a low mtDNA copy number and harbor a sparse mitochondrial infrastructure with immature cristae and limited perinuclear localization (Chung et al., 2007Chung S. Dzeja P.P. Faustino R.S. Perez-Terzic C. Behfar A. Terzic A. Mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is required for the cardiac differentiation of stem cells.Nat. Clin. Pract. Cardiovasc. Med. 2007; 4: S60-S67Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Such mitochondrial infrastructure is also characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Piccoli et al., 2005Piccoli C. Ria R. Scrima R. Cela O. D’Aprile A. Boffoli D. Falzetti F. Tabilio A. Capitanio N. Characterization of mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial oxygen consuming reactions in human hematopoietic stem cells.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26467-26476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Chen et al., 2008bChen C.T. Shih Y.R. Kuo T.K. Lee O.K. Wei Y.H.

Brenner C. Bavister B. Differentiation-related changes in mitochondrial properties as indicators of stem cell competence.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and may represent a marker of stemness (Folmes et al., 2011bFolmes C.D. Nelson T.J. Terzic A.

Mitochondria in stem cells.Mitochondrion. 2007; 7: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consistent with immature mitochondrial morphology, oxidative capacity is reduced and glycolysis-dependent anabolic pathways are enriched in stem cells including ESCs (Cho et al., 2006Cho Y.M. Kwon S.

Methods. 2011; 8: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), promotes stemness while inhibition of glycolysis halts proliferation and precipitates cell death (Kondoh et al., 2007Kondoh H. Lleonart M.E. Nakashima Y. Yokode M. Tanaka M. Bernard D. Gil J. Beach D. A high glycolytic flux supports the proliferative potential of murine embryonic stem cells.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). ESCs also have a high requirement for threonine metabolism to fuel anabolic pathways such as purine synthesis, with threonine withdrawal impairing cell growth and depleting stem cell markers (Wang et al., 2009Wang J. Alexander P. Wu L. Hammer R. Cleaver O. McKnight S.L. Dependence of mouse embryonic stem cells on threonine catabolism.Science. 2009; 325: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Core pluripotency circuitry, including the OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG subset, shares points of convergence with STAT3, a master metabolic regulator controlling the oxidative to glycolytic switch (Chen et al., 2008cChen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W.

Watson C.J. et al.A STAT3-mediated metabolic switch is involved in tumour transformation and STAT3 addiction.Aging (Albany NY). 2010; 2: 823-842PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, the stemness factor OCT4 has a number of targets associated with energy metabolism, which may impact the balance between glycolysis (pyruvate carboxylase and hexokinase 1) and oxidative metabolism (NDUFA3, ATP5D, and ATP5f1) (Chen et al., 2008cChen X.

Oct1 loss of function induces a coordinate metabolic shift that opposes tumorigenicity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Loss of an OCT family member, OCT1, induces a metabolic shift away from glycolysis in favor of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (Shakya et al., 2009Shakya A. Cooksey R. Cox J.E. Wang V. McClain D.A. Tantin D. Oct1 loss of function induces a coordinate metabolic shift that opposes tumorigenicity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Chromatin modifiers, such as polycomb repressor complexes, which promote pluripotency, also target metabolic enzymes within their active gene sets (Brookes et al., 2012Brookes E. de Santiago I. Hebenstreit D. Morris K.J. Carroll T. Xie S.Q. Stock J.K. Heidemann M. Eick D. Nozaki N. et al.Polycomb associates genome-wide with a specific RNA polymerase II variant, and regulates metabolic genes in ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar; Dang, 2012Dang C.V. MYC on the path to cancer.Cell. 2012; 149: 22-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). Moreover, kinase inhibitors (2i), which streamline germline-competent ESC derivation and prevent spontaneous differentiation, upregulate genes associated with metabolic functions (Marks et al., 2012Marks H. Kalkan T. Menafra R. Denissov S. Jones K. Hofemeister H. Nichols J. Kranz A. Stewart A.F. Smith A. Stunnenberg H.G. The transcriptional and epigenomic foundations of ground state pluripotency.Cell. 2012; 149: 590-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Key stemness transcriptional programs thus regulate energy metabolism to promote stem cell homeostasis. Development, envisioned in Waddington’s landscape, depicts gravity propelling a ball from a peak, representing pluripotency, to settle in local minimum elevation points of stable cell states (Enver et al., 2009Enver T. Pera M. Peterson C. Andrews P.W. Stem cell states, fates, and the rules of attraction.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). From the perspective of cell metabolism, the hills within the landscape represent thermodynamic barriers that segregate discrete cell states, with valleys corresponding to the minimum energetic paths connecting states, indicating that a specific metabolic capacity is required to overcome barriers to state conversion. Indeed, the energetic requirements of stem cells and their progeny differ; differentiated cells no longer need to sustain high rates of replication and thus have lower anabolic demands, but they require large amounts of energy to fuel the processes of cellular homeostasis and increasingly specialized functions of the progeny, such as sustained contraction in cardiomyocytes or electrical impulses in neurons (Folmes et al., 2012aFolmes C.D. Nelson T.J. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Energy metabolism plasticity enables stemness programs.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2012; 1254: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The lower requirement for anabolic precursors enables differentiated cells to catabolize substrates in a more energy efficient manner through complete oxidation within the TCA cycle, transfer of reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain, and production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, which for glucose produces 36 to 38 ATP compared to 2 ATP for glycolysis. Prioritization of discrete metabolic pathways offers a mechanism to align bioenergetic needs with evolving identities and specialized functions (Figure 3). Metabolomic comparison of ESCs and their differentiated progeny identified a global enrichment of unsaturated metabolites in the pluripotent state (Yanes et al., 2010Yanes O. Clark J. Wong D.M. Patti G.J. Sánchez-Ruiz A. Benton H.P. Trauger S.A. Desponts C. Ding S. Siuzdak G. Metabolic oxidation regulates embryonic stem cell differentiation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Metabolites with a high degree of structural unsaturation contain a number of carbon-carbon double and triple bonds, which renders them reactive and readily susceptible to oxidative reactions. The unsaturated metabolome may prime ESCs to differentiate in response to oxidative processes, as levels of these metabolites decrease upon differentiation. In support of this concept, inhibition of the eicosanoid pathway in ESCs, which maintains high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, preserves pluripotency, while addition of saturated metabolites to ESC media supports oxidative metabolism and accelerates lineage specification (Yanes et al., 2010Yanes O. Clark J. Wong D.M. Patti G.J. Sánchez-Ruiz A. Benton H.P. Trauger S.A. Desponts C. Ding S. Siuzdak G. Metabolic oxidation regulates embryonic stem cell differentiation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Consistent with an energetically privileged (primed) state, pluripotent cells display hyperpolarized mitochondria (Chung et al., 2007Chung S. Dzeja P.P. Faustino R.S. Perez-Terzic C. Behfar A. Terzic A. Mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is required for the cardiac differentiation of stem cells.Nat. Clin. Pract. Cardiovasc.

Somatic oxidative bioenergetics transitions into pluripotency-dependent glycolysis to facilitate nuclear reprogramming.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 264-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), poised to respond to an increase in energy demand during differentiation through efficient oxidative metabolism. Mitochondrial infrastructure and function can impact differentiation propensity independent of initial pluripotent features (Folmes et al., 2012bFolmes C.D.L. Dzeja P.P. Nelson T.J. Terzic A. Mitochondria in control of cell fate.Circ. Res. 2012; 110: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ESCs with high resting mitochondrial membrane potential have more efficient teratoma formation and less efficient mesodermal differentiation compared to counterparts displaying low mitochondrial potential (Schieke et al., 2008Schieke S.M. Ma M. Cao L. McCoy Jr., J.P. Liu C. Hensel N.F. Barrett A.J. Boehm M. Finkel T. Mitochondrial metabolism modulates differentiation and teratoma formation capacity in mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28506-28512Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Redistribution of mitochondria from the perinuclear space throughout the cytosol during extended passaging of MSCs is associated with greater spontaneous differentiation (Lonergan et al., 2006Lonergan T. Brenner C. Bavister B. Differentiation-related changes in mitochondrial properties as indicators of stem cell competence.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Slow-dividing mesoangioblasts, a precommitted cardiac progenitor cell, have extensive mitochondria and efficiently differentiate into cardiomyocytes, while their fast-dividing counterparts have few mitochondria that cannot support cardiac differentiation (San Martin et al., 2011San Martin N. Cervera A.M. Cordova C. Covarello D. McCreath K.J. Galvez B.G. Mitochondria determine the differentiation potential of cardiac mesoangioblasts.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Stimulation of mitochondria biogenesis can overcome the differentiation block in fast-dividing cells, while reducing mitochondrial content perturbs cardiomyocyte differentiation in slow-dividing cells (San Martin et al., 2011San Martin N. Cervera A.M. Cordova C. Covarello D. McCreath K.J. Galvez B.G. Mitochondria determine the differentiation potential of cardiac mesoangioblasts.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and metabolic infrastructure thus prime stem cells for differentiation. When induced to differentiate, ESCs and MSCs downregulate stemness genes and stimulate mtDNA replication in support of mitochondrial biogenesis and maturation of extensive and interconnected networks of elongated and cristae-rich mitochondria (Chen et al., 2008bChen C.T.

https://openalex.org/W2039741753,"Protein modification by SUMO affects a wide range of protein substrates. Surprisingly, although SUMO pathway mutants display strong phenotypes, the function of individual SUMO modifications is often enigmatic, and SUMOylation-defective mutants commonly lack notable phenotypes. Here, we use DNA double-strand break repair as an example and show that DNA damage triggers a SUMOylation wave, leading to simultaneous multisite modifications of several repair proteins of the same pathway. Catalyzed by a DNA-bound SUMO ligase and triggered by single-stranded DNA, SUMOylation stabilizes physical interactions between the proteins. Notably, only wholesale elimination of SUMOylation of several repair proteins significantly affects the homologous recombination pathway by considerably slowing down DNA repair. Thus, SUMO acts synergistically on several proteins, and individual modifications only add up to efficient repair. We propose that SUMOylation may thus often target a protein group rather than individual proteins, whereas localized modification enzymes and highly specific triggers ensure specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2109511835,"Individuals with the red hair/fair skin phenotype usually carry a polymorphism in the gene encoding the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) that results in the production of pigment containing a high pheomelanin-to-eumelanin ratio; here it is shown in a mouse model that inactivation of Mc1r promotes melanoma formation in the presence of the Braf oncogene, thus suggesting that pheomelanin synthesis is carcinogenic by an ultraviolet-radiation-independent mechanism. Individuals with a 'redhead' phenotype — who typically have pale skin, red hair and an inability to tan — often carry a polymorphism in the gene encoding the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) that reduces its ability to stimulate the production of the black/brown pigment eumelanin from the red/yellow pigment pheomelanin. David Fisher and colleagues report that in a mouse model, inactivation of Mc1r promotes melanoma formation in the presence of BRAFV600E, the most common melanoma oncoprotein, independently of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. They find that it is pheomelanin synthesis per se that promotes melanoma formation, through an increase in oxidative damage, because abrogation of all pigment production in the mice abolishes the effects. In practical terms this suggests that further protective strategies, in addition to avoiding sunlight, could be of benefit in at-risk individuals. People with pale skin, red hair, freckles and an inability to tan—the ‘red hair/fair skin’ phenotype—are at highest risk of developing melanoma, compared to all other pigmentation types1. Genetically, this phenotype is frequently the product of inactivating polymorphisms in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. MC1R encodes a cyclic AMP-stimulating G-protein-coupled receptor that controls pigment production. Minimal receptor activity, as in red hair/fair skin polymorphisms, produces the red/yellow pheomelanin pigment, whereas increasing MC1R activity stimulates the production of black/brown eumelanin2. Pheomelanin has weak shielding capacity against ultraviolet radiation relative to eumelanin, and has been shown to amplify ultraviolet-A-induced reactive oxygen species3,4,5. Several observations, however, complicate the assumption that melanoma risk is completely ultraviolet-radiation-dependent. For example, unlike non-melanoma skin cancers, melanoma is not restricted to sun-exposed skin and ultraviolet radiation signature mutations are infrequently oncogenic drivers6. Although linkage of melanoma risk to ultraviolet radiation exposure is beyond doubt, ultraviolet-radiation-independent events are likely to have a significant role1,7. Here we introduce a conditional, melanocyte-targeted allele of the most common melanoma oncoprotein, BRAFV600E, into mice carrying an inactivating mutation in the Mc1r gene (these mice have a phenotype analogous to red hair/fair skin humans). We observed a high incidence of invasive melanomas without providing additional gene aberrations or ultraviolet radiation exposure. To investigate the mechanism of ultraviolet-radiation-independent carcinogenesis, we introduced an albino allele, which ablates all pigment production on the Mc1re/e background. Selective absence of pheomelanin synthesis was protective against melanoma development. In addition, normal Mc1re/e mouse skin was found to have significantly greater oxidative DNA and lipid damage than albino-Mc1re/e mouse skin. These data suggest that the pheomelanin pigment pathway produces ultraviolet-radiation-independent carcinogenic contributions to melanomagenesis by a mechanism of oxidative damage. Although protection from ultraviolet radiation remains important, additional strategies may be required for optimal melanoma prevention."

https://openalex.org/W2131717226,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) maintain spermatogenesis throughout a man's life and may have application for treating some cases of male infertility, including those caused by chemotherapy before puberty. We performed autologous and allogeneic SSC transplantations into the testes of 18 adult and 5 prepubertal recipient macaques that were rendered infertile with alkylating chemotherapy. After autologous transplant, the donor genotype from lentivirus-marked SSCs was evident in the ejaculated sperm of 9/12 adult and 3/5 prepubertal recipients after they reached maturity. Allogeneic transplant led to donor-recipient chimerism in sperm from 2/6 adult recipients. Ejaculated sperm from one recipient transplanted with allogeneic donor SSCs were injected into 85 rhesus oocytes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Eighty-one oocytes were fertilized, producing embryos ranging from four-cell to blastocyst with donor paternal origin confirmed in 7/81 embryos. This demonstration of functional donor spermatogenesis following SSC transplantation in primates is an important milestone for informed clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W2154811651,"Models of unregulated nitric oxide (NO) diffusion do not consistently account for the biochemistry of NO synthase (NOS)-dependent signalling in many cell systems. For example, endothelial NOS controls blood pressure, blood flow and oxygen delivery through its effect on vascular smooth muscle tone, but the regulation of these processes is not adequately explained by simple NO diffusion from endothelium to smooth muscle. Here we report a new model for the regulation of NO signalling by demonstrating that haemoglobin (Hb) α (encoded by the HBA1 and HBA2 genes in humans) is expressed in human and mouse arterial endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial junction, where it regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity. Notably, this function is unique to Hb α and is abrogated by its genetic depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial Hb α haem iron in the Fe(3+) state permits NO signalling, and this signalling is shut off when Hb α is reduced to the Fe(2+) state by endothelial cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3, also known as diaphorase 1). Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CYB5R3 increases NO bioactivity in small arteries. These data reveal a new mechanism by which the regulation of the intracellular Hb α oxidation state controls NOS signalling in non-erythroid cells. This model may be relevant to haem-containing globins in a broad range of NOS-containing somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1990646351,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are key epigenetic regulators of hematopietic stem cell (HSC) fate. The PcG members Ezh2 and Ezh1 are important determinants of embryonic stem cell identity, and the transcript levels of these histone methyltransferases are inversely correlated during development. However, the role of Ezh1 in somatic stem cells is largely unknown. Here we show that Ezh1 maintains repopulating HSCs in a slow-cycling, undifferentiated state, protecting them from senescence. Ezh1 ablation induces significant loss of adult HSCs, with concomitant impairment of their self-renewal capacity due to a potent senescence response. Epigenomic and gene expression changes induced by Ezh1 deletion in senesced HSCs demonstrated that Ezh1-mediated PRC2 activity catalyzes monomethylation and dimethylation of H3K27. Deletion of Cdkn2a on the Ezh1 null background rescued HSC proliferation and survival. Our results suggest that Ezh1 is an important histone methyltransferase for HSC maintenance."

The presence of hemogenesis in the midgestation head is indicated by the appearance of intravascular cluster cells and the blood-forming capacity of a sorted endothelial cell population.

Bona fide HSCs emerge in the mouse embryonic head before appearing in the circulation Endothelial cells (ECs) in the mouse embryonic head have hemogenic potential HSCs derived from ECs in the embryonic head contribute to postnatal hematopoiesis Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can continuously produce hematopoietic cells of all lineages throughout the lifetime of an individual. Experimentally, they are defined by the competence to engraft into the bone marrow (BM) of lethally irradiated recipients and the ability to rebuild all the components of hematopoietic system via self-renewal and differentiation. Whereas BM serves as the main niche for supporting HSC activity in postnatal stage, the early emergence, stepwise maturation, and remarkable expansion of fetal HSCs occurs in different locations and is temporally restricted during mouse embryogenesis (Cumano and Godin, 2007Cumano A.

The journey of developing hematopoietic stem cells.Development. 2006; 133: 3733-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The first visible blood cells, the nucleated primitive erythrocytes producing embryonic hemoglobin, arise in the mouse extraembryonic yolk sac (YS) at embryonic day 7.0–7.5 (E7.0–7.5), concomitant with the developing vasculature (McGrath and Palis, 2005McGrath K.E. Palis J. Hematopoiesis in the yolk sac: more than meets the eye.Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 1021-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, the YS yields a cohort of unilineage and multilineage erythromyeloid progenitors that can migrate into the embryo proper via circulation (Lux et al., 2008Lux C.T. Yoshimoto M. McGrath K. Conway S.J. Palis J. Yoder M.C. All primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells emerging before E10 in the mouse embryo are products of the yolk sac.Blood. 2008; 111: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As the HSCs are positioned at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy and can ensure life-long production of blood cells, the questions of when, where, and how the HSCs are generated during mammalian embryogenesis are under intensive investigations but remain highly debated (Yoshimoto et al., 2008Yoshimoto M. Porayette P. Yoder M.C.

Among various midgestation embryonic tissues, the cells capable of long-term, high-level, and multilineage hematopoietic repopulation can first be exclusively detected in the E10.5 (>35 somite pairs; sp) aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region (Müller et al., 1994Müller A.M.

As further revealed by organ or reaggregation cultures, the HSC potential of the AGM region can be autonomously and remarkably augmented via maturation of a large number of nascent HSC precursors (pre-HSCs) (Cumano et al., 1996Cumano A.

Moreover, HSCs are detected simultaneously or slightly later in other major vessels (umbilical arteries and vitelline arteries) or highly vascularized structures (placenta and YS) at E10.5–E11.0 (de Bruijn et al., 2000de Bruijn M.F.

Interestingly, a type of newborn-repopulating HSC has been identified in both the YS and the para-aortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp, destined to form the AGM region) of E9.5 embryos via intraliver transplantation. Such cells are CD34+c-Kit+ and CD41+, and can further engraft into the BM of adults, implicating that they are immature precursors of adult-type HSCs (Ferkowicz et al., 2003Ferkowicz M.J. Starr M.

Furthermore, using a nonheartbeat Ncx1−/− mouse model, T and B lymphoid potential are observed in the P-Sp, YS, and placenta of E9.5 embryos, suggesting that the generation of lymphoid progenitor cells is independent of circulation (Rhodes et al., 2008Rhodes K.E. Gekas C. Wang Y. Lux C.T. Francis C.S. Chan D.N. Conway S. Orkin S.H. Yoder M.C. Mikkola H.K. The emergence of hematopoietic stem cells is initiated in the placental vasculature in the absence of circulation.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 252-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Notably, the placenta contains 15-fold more HSCs than AGM and YS at E12.5–E13.5 (Gekas et al., 2005Gekas C. Dieterlen-Lièvre F. Orkin S.H. Mikkola H.K. The placenta is a niche for hematopoietic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Unlike the hemogenic sites, the fetal liver cannot form HSCs de novo but is colonized by external HSCs via circulation (Zovein et al., 2008Zovein A.C. Hofmann J.J. Lynch M. French W.J. Turlo K.A. Yang Y. Becker M.S. Zanetta L. Dejana E. Gasson J.C. et al.Fate tracing reveals the endothelial origin of hematopoietic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). During the entire course of embryonic hematopoiesis, the formation of blood cells is closely correlated with vascular development. For the mouse embryo proper, vasculogenesis is initiated at E7.3 in the cranial part, and the dorsal aorta becomes discernable slightly later (Drake and Fleming, 2000Drake C.J. Fleming P.A. Vasculogenesis in the day 6.5 to 9.5 mouse embryo.Blood. 2000; 95: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, putative angioblasts within the rostral vasculature coexpress Flk-1 and Scl, the markers of hematopoietic specification from mesodermal precursors. By analyzing the hemogenic potential of epiblast tissue at E6.5–E7.7, Kanatsu et al. found that the anterior head-fold has hemogenic potential if activin or BMP4 is added (Kanatsu and Nishikawa, 1996Kanatsu M. Nishikawa S.I. In vitro analysis of epiblast tissue potency for hematopoietic cell differentiation.Development. 1996; 122: 823-830PubMed Google Scholar). At E9.5, the head contains a number of erythromyeloid progenitors no less than the number in the AGM region (Palis et al., 1999Palis J. Robertson S. Kennedy M. Wall C. Keller G. Development of erythroid and myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and embryo proper of the mouse.Development. 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More strikingly, after the AGM and fetal liver are removed, the remnants of the E11 embryo proper demonstrate robust HSC potential in vivo, which is not detected in concomitant circulating cells (Müller et al., 1994Müller A.M. Medvinsky A. Strouboulis J. Grosveld F. Dzierzak E. Development of hematopoietic stem cell activity in the mouse embryo.Immunity. 1994; 1: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, prior to circulation, the zebrafish head is an important site for early embryonic hematopoiesis, including genesis of macrophages and granulocytes (Bennett et al., 2001Bennett C.M. Kanki J.P. Rhodes J. Liu T.X. Paw B.H. Kieran M.W. Langenau D.M. Delahaye-Brown A. Zon L.I. Fleming M.D. Look A.T.

Origins and unconventional behavior of neutrophils in developing zebrafish.Blood. 2008; 111: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The above direct and indirect clues prompted us to comprehensively analyze the hematopoietic activity in the rostral half of embryo proper during mouse midgestation. Here, we report that the mouse E10.5–E11.5 head harbors authentic HSCs, which demonstrate long-term, efficient, and multilineage reconstitution and self-renewal capacity in lethally irradiated adult recipients. Such potential cannot be explained by later and rare emergence of HSCs in the embryonic circulation. Development of hemogenic endothelium in the head is further confirmed by morphological, functional, and lineage tracing strategies. More convincingly, in a unique SP-A-Cre transgenic mouse model, which is a fully physiological setting, the cerebrovascular endothelium demonstrates de novo hematopoietic potential and contribution to postnatal HSCs. In E9.5–E12.5 embryos (Figure 1A, a representative E10.5 embryo), the numbers of colony-forming units in the culture (CFU-Cs) of the caudal half (CH) or AGM region seemed steady (Figure 1B). In contrast, dramatic changes were observed in the head region. The number of CFU-Cs was increased from E9.5 (131 per tissue), peaked at E11.5 (1,074 per tissue), and then declined at E12.5 (704 per tissue). The percentage of CFU-GM and CFU-Mix in the head and CH/AGM appeared to be comparable between E9.5–E11.5 (Figure 1C, and data not shown). The CFU-Cs in the E10.5–11.0 head were mainly enriched in the Tie2+ population (Figure 1D). Lymphoid potential is thought to be an important indicator of definitive hematopoiesis. Here, the OP9 and OP9-DL1 cells were used to induce B and T lymphocytes, respectively. After being cocultured with the OP9 cells for 8–9 days, the Tie2+ cells from E9.5 heads were significantly expanded (Figure 1E), to an average of 4.1 × 105 cells per head region (from three independent experiments). Flow cytometry detected CD19+ (44.6%–68.6%) populations (Figure 1F). For one embryo equivalent (ee), the Tie2+ head cells gave rise to 2.34 × 105 CD19+ B cells, slightly lower than the CH ones (Figure 1G). For T lymphocyte differentiation, three or four passages on fresh OP9-DL1 feeders were required over 3–4 weeks. From day 13 onward, the head/OP9-DL1 cocultures generated a CD25+CD44− population, with a stepwise increase from 8.9% to 24.9%, indicating an early commitment to T cell lineage (Figure 1H). At day 26, the CD4+CD8+ and CD3+TCRβ+ populations reached up to 7.6% and 7.8%, respectively. That is, 1 ee of head could yield 1.13 × 109 CD4+CD8+ and 1.16 × 109 CD3+TCRβ+ cells in the coculture. Similarly, the Tie2+ cells from E9.5 CH gave rise to 1.70 × 109 CD4+CD8+ and 2.22 × 109 CD3+TCRβ+ cells (Figure 1H). Long-term transplantation is widely accepted as the most stringent and reliable assay for HSC activity. Previous literatures indicate that the adult-repopulating HSCs are rare in the mouse E10.5 conceptus (Gekas et al., 2005Gekas C. Dieterlen-Lièvre F. Orkin S.H. Mikkola H.K.

Development of hematopoietic stem cell activity in the mouse embryo.Immunity. 1994; 1: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Müller et al. revealed that the first adult-reconstituting HSC arose exclusively in the AGM region of E10.5 conceptus (34–41 sp), but its engraftment efficiency was low as only 3 out of 96 recipients in total were repopulated (Müller et al., 1994Müller A.M.

Development of hematopoietic stem cell activity in the mouse embryo.Immunity. 1994; 1: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Since the E9.5–E11.5 head region demonstrated robust multipotent lymphomyeloid potential in vitro, we wondered whether adult-repopulating HSCs developed concurrently in this site. Here, to improve the efficacy, we used more cells (1.7–2.5 ee per recipient) and a higher radiation dose rate (2.3 Gy per minute). The total cell numbers for transplantation at indicated time points are shown in Table S1 (available online). As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2A, none of the recipients transplanted with 1 ee of E10.5 (36–41 sp) AGM was repopulated with >10% chimerism after 16 weeks (n = 13, four independent experiments). Three recipients displayed <5.0% chimerism after 4 weeks, but the positive signals disappeared when retested 16 weeks posttransplantation (data not shown). In contrast, with 1.7–2.5 ee injection, 14–15 out of 39–40 recipients (13 independent experiments) were repopulated, with an average short-term chimerism of 27.5% ± 14.6% (>4 weeks) and long-term chimerism of 46.6% ± 22.4% (>16 weeks). In parallel, transplantation with E10.5 head cells led to successful reconstitution in 4–5 out of 40 recipients, with an average short-term chimerism of 27.3% ± 10.3% and long-term chimerism of 57.2% ± 22.9%. Two successful recipients received donor cells from the heads of <40 sp (1 of 37–38 sp and 1 of 38–39 sp heads, from two independent experiments). However, transplantation with 1.7–2.5 ee cells from E10.5 embryonic circulation (36–41 sp) did not repopulate the recipients (n = 29, 11 independent experiments), consistent with previous studies (Gekas et al., 2005Gekas C.

At E11.5, transplantation of 1 ee of head cells (42–50 sp) resulted in 40% of recipients (8/20) being efficiently repopulated, with an average long-term chimerism of 54.6% ± 23.8%. The efficiency was approaching that of the AGM region (60%, 9/15). Notably, two recipients could be repopulated with 0.3 ee of E11.5 head cells. At this time point, the embryonic circulating cells began to display reconstitution capacity (3 repopulated out of 15 recipients). Of note, repopulation was only detected in the recipients transplanted with late E11.5 circulating cells (from pooled 44–47 sp or 47–50 sp embryos). The inability of early E11.5 (<45 sp) embryonic circulating cells to reconstitute the adult hosts at high levels has been documented in several reports (Gekas et al., 2005Gekas C. Dieterlen-Lièvre F.

Furthermore, with infusion of 0.5 ee of E12.5 head cells, 13 out of 21 recipients could be efficiently repopulated, resembling that of the AGM region (5/11).Table 1The Emergence of Adult-Repopulating HSCs in the Mouse Embryonic Head and AGM RegionTime Posttransplantation>4 Weeks>16 WeeksStageOrganeeaee, embryo equivalents.Exp (n)RebRe, repopulated./TotalChimerism (%)Re/TotalChimerism (%)E10.5 (36–41 spcsp, somite pairs.)head140/11NAdNA, not available.0/9NA1.7–2.5134/4027.3 ± 10.35/4057.2 ± 22.9AGM140/13NA0/11NA1.7–2.51314/4027.5 ± 14.615/3946.6 ± 22.4blood140/5NA0/5NA1.7–2.5110/29NA0/27NAE11.5 (42–50 sp)head0.341/1648.02/2319.5, 56.41610/1827.8 ± 10.58/2054.6 ± 23.8AGM0.330/16NA0/16NA159/1532.8 ± 14.79/1547.9 ± 20.9blood0.310/5NA0/5NA153/1536.5 ± 6.53/1548.0 ± 19.3E12.5head0.5312/2139.5 ± 17.513/2149.3 ± 19.0AGM0.536/1134.7 ± 14.25/1150.1 ± 22.2a ee, embryo equivalents.b Re, repopulated.c sp, somite pairs.d NA, not available. Open table in a new tab Bona fide HSCs are functionally identified by two features: multilineage reconstitution and self-renewal ability. We analyzed multilineage repopulation in hematopoietic organs from recipients of head or AGM-derived cells (Figures 2B–2E; Figures S1A–S1D). The presence of E10.5 head- (38–39 sp) derived GFP+ myeloid (Gr-1+ or Mac-1+), B lymphoid (B220+), and T lymphoid (CD3+) cells was detected in the peripheral blood of repopulated recipient 6 months after transplantation (Figure 2B). Likewise, in the BM, thymus, and spleen of the same recipient, efficient multilineage engraftment was observed (Figures 2C–2E). Furthermore, self-renewal capacity was investigated by secondary transplantation of 3 × 106 BM cells from primary recipients that had been successfully repopulated with E10.5 head- or AGM-derived cells (Figure 2F). For instance, the BM cells from the recipient repopulated by head cells of 38–39 sp could efficiently engraft into the secondary hosts (H1 in Figure 2F), as revealed by multilineage chimerism in the peripheral blood 6 months after transplantation (Figure S1E). As expected, BM cells from E10.5 AGM-repopulated recipients (all donors of 36–41 sp) demonstrated a similar self-renewing capacity (Figure 2F and Figure S1E). Subsequently, we analyzed the immunophenotype of head HSCs. Similar to CFU-Cs in vitro, transplantation of Tie2+ rather than Tie2− population from E12.5 head led to reconstitution in 4 out of 12 recipients, similar to the AGM region (5/12, Figure 2G). Reportedly, HSCs in the mouse AGM, YS, and placenta reside in the CD34+c-Kit+ population (Gekas et al., 2005Gekas C. Dieterlen-Lièvre F. Orkin S.H. Mikkola H.K.

Likewise, the CD34+c-Kit+ population in the E12.5 head, constituting 0.2%–0.3% of collagenase-digested cells, could efficiently repopulate irradiated adult recipients (3/13) over 6 months (Figure S1F, two independent experiments). Combinations of c-Kit with CD34, CD41, or CD45 were used to roughly calculate the number of hematopoietic precursors. The frequencies of CD34+c-Kit+, CD41+c-Kit+, and CD45+c-Kit+ cells were comparable between the head and AGM region of E10.5 embryos (Figure 3A). Quantitatively, 1 ee of E10.5 head contained 6.8 × 103 CD34+c-Kit+, 4.0 × 103 CD41+c-Kit+, and 3.8 × 103 CD45+c-Kit+ cells on average (Figure 3B, three independent experiments). The double positive populations were also evident in the E9.5 and E11.5 head region (Figures S2A and S2B). Next, real-time PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels of hematopoietic/endothelial-related molecules in the head and AGM region. In particular, it is reported that Runx1 is expressed in all of the adult-repopulating HSCs of midgestation mouse embryos (North et al., 2002North T.E. de Bruijn M.F. Stacy T. Talebian L. Lind E. Robin C. Binder M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A. Runx1 expression marks long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells in the midgestation mouse embryo.Immunity. 2002; 16: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and the proximal P2 promoter (P2-Runx1) is more critically required, compared with the distal promoter, in the endothelium-hematopoietic cell transition (Bee et al., 2010Bee T. Swiers G. Muroi S. Pozner A. Nottingham W. Santos A.C. Li P.S. Taniuchi I. de Bruijn M.F.

The differential activities of Runx1 promoters define milestones during embryonic hematopoiesis.Blood. 2009; 114: 5279-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3C, at E10.5, the transcription levels of Scl, P2-Runx1, and GATA-2 in the head were 1.5-, 1.6-, and 2.3-fold relative, respectively, to that in the AGM region of littermates (three or four independent experiments). The expression levels of endothelial markers were comparable. Furthermore, the expression levels of three transcriptional factors were analyzed in specific subpopulations (Tie2+ or CD31+c-Kit+) that enriched hematopoietic potential in vitro and in vivo. Compared with E10.5, a significant decrease of P2-Runx1 transcription was observed in the CD31+c-Kit+ subsets of E11.5 embryos (Figure S2C), implying the downregulation of endothelial-hematopoietic transition. In contrast, a doubling of GATA-2 transcription at E11.5 might indicate expansion of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (Figure S2C). Comparable expression of P2-Runx1 between head and AGM was observed in either Tie2+ or CD31+c-Kit+ population (Figures 3D and 3E). These data suggested a cellular and molecular phenotype matching the hematopoietic potential of the head. A previous report has documented the hematopoietic potential of gastrulating head region in optimized conditions (Kanatsu and Nishikawa, 1996Kanatsu M. Nishikawa S.I. In vitro analysis of epiblast tissue potency for hematopoietic cell differentiation.Development. 1996; 122: 823-830PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the head and CH were carefully isolated from the precirculation embryo proper (E8.25, 1–6 sp) (Figure S2D), digested into single-cell suspension, and transferred to OP9 stromal cells in accordance with recent reports (Yoshimoto et al., 2011Yoshimoto M. Montecino-Rodriguez E. Ferkowicz M.J. Porayette P. Shelley W.C. Conway S.J. Dorshkind K. Yoder M.C. Embryonic day 9 yolk sac and intra-embryonic hemogenic endothelium independently generate a B-1 and marginal zone progenitor lacking B-2 potential.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 1468-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the clones composed of semiadherent round cells formed (Figure S2E), some of which underwent significant expansion within the next 5–7 days. As a result, the CH cells yielded a total of 83 clones in 11 experiments, and the head, 12 clones in 5 experiments. Flow cytometry analysis showed the presence of CD19+ cells in four experiments of the CH cocultures, a rate more frequent than that of the head cocultures (one experiment, Figure S2F). Notably, under the same conditions, the E8.25 YS was also capable of generating CD19+ B lymphocytes (data not shown). Subsequently, the cells coexpressing CD41 and c-Kit, which represent definitive hematopoietic progenitors (Ferkowicz et al., 2003Ferkowicz M.J. Starr M. Xie X. Li W. Johnson S.A. Shelley W.C. Morrison P.R. Yoder M.C.

Expression of CD41 marks the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo.Blood. 2003; 101: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure S2G, the head region and CH had 0.14%–0.44% and 0.11%–0.76% of CD41+c-Kit+ cells, respectively. At E8.5 (8–12 sp), the frequency was significantly increased in the head (1.24% on average) and CH (1.37% on average) (Figure S2G, three independent experiments). It was interesting to note that a small population of CD34+c-Kit+ was present in both E8.25 head and CH (Figure S2H). In comparison, expression of CD144, Sca-1, and CD45 was very limited in the c-Kit+ population (Figure S2H). Real-time PCR analysis showed comparable expression of Scl, Flk-1, and P2-Runx1 in the E8.25 head, compared with CH (Figure S2I). Given the obvious hematopoietic capacity of the embryonic head, we aimed to determine whether the head could generate blood cells de novo via an endothelial intermediate, which has been observed in the known hemogenic sites, such as AGM, YS, and placenta. To address the issue, a set of experiments were conducted. In the AGM region, intra-aortic cluster cells expressing endothelial markers are thought to grow out from the putative hemogenic endothelium, which is visualized initially at E9.5 and maximally at E10.5. Such cluster cells coincide with a distinguished CD31+c-Kithigh subset in flow cytometry (Yokomizo and"

Gene expression profiling of hematopoietic stem cells during embryonic development Expression profiles used to construct gene regulatory networks Multiple regulators of HSC development implicated ESC-derived HSCs resemble definitive HSCs but lack a Notch-signaling signature Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been extensively analyzed via global transcriptional profiling, which has yielded novel insights into their unique biology (Seita and Weissman, 2010Seita J. Weissman I.L. Hematopoietic stem cell: self-renewal versus differentiation.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Syst. Biol. Med. 2010; 2: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). A recent examination of human HSCs and their progeny revealed both hematopoietic cell-type specific and “reused” transcriptional programs (Novershtern et al., 2011Novershtern N. Subramanian A. Lawton L.N. Mak R.H. Haining W.N. McConkey M.E. Habib N. Yosef N. Chang C.Y. Shay T. et al.Densely interconnected transcriptional circuits control cell states in human hematopoiesis.Cell. 2011; 144: 296-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). A similarly comprehensive examination of the transcriptome of embryonic HSCs is absent from the literature, largely due to the practical difficulties of prospectively isolating sufficient quantities of highly purified HSCs and precursors from embryos (Godin and Cumano, 2002Godin I. Cumano A. The hare and the tortoise: an embryonic haematopoietic race.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The description of Sox17 as a disparate regulator of fetal versus adult HSCs indicates that distinct molecular pathways likely govern different stages of HSC development (Kim et al., 2007Kim I. Saunders T.L. Morrison S.J. Sox17 dependence distinguishes the transcriptional regulation of fetal from adult hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2007; 130: 470-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A deep understanding of the molecular regulation of HSC ontogeny would inform efforts to expand HSCs in vitro and induce HSC generation during pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation, as well as illuminate novel disease-causing genes. Definitive adult-type HSCs are born in the E10.5 aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM), and thereafter migrate to the fetal liver (FL), placenta, and bone marrow (Medvinsky et al., 2011Medvinsky A. Rybtsov S. Taoudi S. Embryonic origin of the adult hematopoietic system: advances and questions.Development. 2011; 138: 1017-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). HSCs apparently emerge from a subset of endothelial cells in the ventral aspect of the dorsal aorta (recently reviewed in detail; Medvinsky et al., 2011Medvinsky A. Rybtsov S. Taoudi S. Embryonic origin of the adult hematopoietic system: advances and questions.Development. 2011; 138: 1017-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Imaging reveals the dramatic “bending” of hemogenic endothelial cells as they move into the aortic space (Kissa and Herbomel, 2010Kissa K. Herbomel P. Blood stem cells emerge from aortic endothelium by a novel type of cell transition.Nature. 2010; 464: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Although these emergent cells have not been directly demonstrated to be functional HSCs, the preponderance of evidence indicates that definitive HSCs arise from hemogenic endothelium. Directed differentiation of PSCs to specific lineages for research and cell therapy is a major goal of stem cell biology. Nearly 2 decades of effort has not yielded robust, definitive HSCs from PSCs (McKinney-Freeman and Daley, 2007McKinney-Freeman S.L. Daley G.Q. Towards hematopoietic reconstitution from embryonic stem cells: a sanguine future.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of the homeotic genes HoxB4 and Cdx4 produced cells that reconstituted multilineage hematopoiesis in lethally irradiated primary and secondary mice (Kyba et al., 2002Kyba M. Perlingeiro R.C. Daley G.Q.

Although this approach generated hematopoietic progenitors with the cardinal stem cell features of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation, these embryonic-stem-cell-derived HSCs (ESC-HSCs) do not faithfully mimic the function or phenotype of whole bone marrow (WBM)-HSCs (Bonde et al., 2008Bonde S.

Recent data proposing the equivalence of hemogenic endothelium and the hemangioblast that arises during ESC differentiation (Lancrin et al., 2009Lancrin C. Sroczynska P. Stephenson C. Allen T. Kouskoff V. Lacaud G. The haemangioblast generates haematopoietic cells through a haemogenic endothelium stage.Nature. 2009; 457: 892-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) suggests that discerning the molecular pathways of hematopoietic ontogeny in vivo will provide a roadmap for differentiating definitive HSCs from PSCs in vitro. Here, we present the most complete analysis of the transcriptional program of definitive HSC ontogeny to date, gleaned from rigorously characterized hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations isolated from over 2,500 murine embryos and adult mice. To illuminate combinatorial control of gene expression, we applied a computational analysis that identifies a gene regulatory network for each critical developmental stage (Faith et al., 2007Faith J.J. Hayete B. Thaden J.T. Mogno I. Wierzbowski J. Cottarel G. Kasif S. Collins J.J. Gardner T.S. Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). We then validated several predicted regulators in HSC ontogeny via morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos. We discovered that HSCs exist in only three distinct transcriptional states during ontogeny and that a subset of HSCs from E12.5 FL retain the transcriptional signature of their endothelial precursors. Ultimately, we compared the transcriptional profiles of ESCs, ESC-derived hematopoietic progenitors, and ESC-HSCs to their potential in vivo counterparts, and found that ESC-HSCs most closely resemble definitive HSCs but are defective in essential HSC regulatory pathways, perhaps accounting for their functional deficits. Taken together, our unique data set, available to the stem cell community as a searchable web resource (http://hsc.hms.harvard.edu), illuminates aspects of hematopoietic development that will prove valuable for research in developmental hematopoiesis and in vitro directed differentiation. The technical challenges of purifying HSCs to absolute homogeneity from FL and WBM has not precluded the derivation of important biological insights from analysis of the global gene expression profiles of highly purified populations of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J.

Weissman I.L. Hematopoietic stem cell: self-renewal versus differentiation.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Syst. Biol. Med. 2010; 2: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Here, we restricted our purification scheme to surface markers that enrich functionally for hematopoietic repopulation (yolk sac [YS], placenta, FL, WBM, and ESC-HSCs) or HSC precursors (embryoid body [EB]-derived cells and AGM) (Figure 1A and Table 1). E9 YS CD41+c-kit+CD34+ cells can contribute to life-long hematopoiesis when transplanted into neonates (Ferkowicz et al., 2003Ferkowicz M.J. Starr M. Xie X. Li W. Johnson S.A. Shelley W.C.

CD41 expression defines the onset of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis in the murine embryo.Development. 2003; 130: 4393-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). E11.5 AGM HSCs are exceedingly rare (one to three functional HSCs per embryo; Kumaravelu et al., 2002Kumaravelu P. Hook L. Morrison A.M. Ure J. Zhao S. Zuyev S. Ansell J. Medvinsky A.

However, between E11.5 and E12.5, HSCs expand dramatically in the placenta and FL (Kumaravelu et al., 2002Kumaravelu P. Hook L. Morrison A.M. Ure J. Zhao S. Zuyev S. Ansell J. Medvinsky A.

This expansion results partly from an acceleration in de novo HSC specification from VE-cadherin+CD45+ AGM hemogenic precursors (Taoudi et al., 2008Taoudi S. Gonneau C. Moore K. Sheridan J.M.

To capture the molecular transition from hemogenic endothelium to definitive HSCs, we isolated VE-cadherin+CD45+ cells from E11.5 AGM and HSCs from E12.5 placenta and FL. We also collected HSCs from E13.5 FL, E14.5 FL, adult WBM, and ESCs (McKinney-Freeman et al., 2008McKinney-Freeman S.L. Lengerke C. Jang I.H. Schmitt S. Wang Y. Philitas M. Shea J. Daley G.Q.

Samples were double sorted into lysis buffer via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to assure cell purities of >95%, minimal loss of material, and maximal RNA integrity (Figure 1B and Figure S1 available online). Three to six biological replicates were collected for each population.

Open table in a new tab nr, not recorded. Pearson correlations between biological replicates revealed that most samples within a group were well correlated (Figure S2A). Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) reveal that embryonic hematopoietic populations segregate into three transcriptionally distinct groups, designated as “YS-like,” “Specifying HSCs,” and “Definitive HSCs” (Figures 2A and 2B ). Placenta and AGM samples cluster together (Figures 2A and 2B), confirming recent data that both are sites of hematopoietic specification (Rhodes et al., 2008Rhodes K.E. Gekas C. Wang Y. Lux C.T.

Interestingly, two E12.5 FL samples align with the AGM, whereas four align with later-stage FL and WBM HSCs (Figure 2A). We termed the AGM-like E12.5 FL samples “FL12 A,” and the FL-like E12.5 FL samples “FL12 F.” FL12 F, E13.5 FL, E14.5 FL, and WBM-HSCs cluster as one group (i.e. Definitive HSCs) while E9 YS clusters separately with EB-derived hematopoietic progenitors. Definitive HSCs isolated from FL across 2 days of embryonic development (E12.5–14.5) are nearly indistinguishable by gene expression. Nine genes were differentially expressed in FL12 F versus E13.5 FL and only five genes distinguished E13.5 from E14.5 (http://hsc.hms.harvard.edu). In contrast, 619 genes were differentially expressed between AGM and FL12 F HSCs (http://hsc.hms.harvard.edu). The clustering of FL12 A with placenta/AGM rather than FL/WBM suggests that the transcriptional signature of HSCs immediately upon arrival in the FL represents a critical transitional stage from hemogenic endothelium to definitive HSCs that can be observed fortuitously in some embryos (Figures 2A and 2B). Although AGM and FL12 A cluster together, they are transcriptionally distinct when specific hematopoietic genes are examined (Figure S2B). In total, our data reveal that AGM and FL12 A are distinct, yet transcriptionally related cell populations. To determine whether differences in the HSPC gene regulatory network (GRN) contribute to the three distinct transcriptional states of developing HSCs, we first identified the context-dependent GRNs of 44 distinct cell types and tissues, including HSPCs, using publicly available data (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). There are three components to each GRN: genes expressed by a cell type or tissue, the transcription factors (TFs) predicted to regulate these genes, and cooperating gene sets that must be highly expressed for the TFs to exert a regulatory influence (contexts). We compared the expression of the HSPC GRN in YS and AGM to WBM (Figure 2C). The expression of the HSPC regulators Erg, Nfe2, Hoxa9, and Hlf did not reach an adult HSC expression level in the YS and AGM. Also, Tulp4, a predicted repressor of the HSPC GRN, is highly expressed in both the YS-like and Specifying HSCs. However, Myb, Gata2, Tal1, Etv6, Prdm5, and Homez had low expression only in Specifying HSCs, suggesting that this difference contributes to the distinct states of the YS-like and Specifying groups. Examining the progression of GRN changes in the Definitive HSC population from FL12 to FL14, we found that Fos and Fosb are downregulated in highly proliferative FL HSCs (Figure 2C), consistent with their role as gatekeepers to HSC mitotic entry (Okada et al., 1999Okada S. Fukuda T. Inada K. Tokuhisa T. Prolonged expression of c-fos suppresses cell cycle entry of dormant hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 1999; 93: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). Our data represent the first global expression profiling of HSPCs and their precursors from the AGM, YS, and placenta. To determine the global resemblance of these populations to known, adult cell populations, we applied a Naive Bayesian classifier that calculates the probability that an unknown sample is indistinguishable from known cells types and tissues (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). HSCs from WBM, FL12 F, E13.5 FL, E14.5 FL, E9 YS, E12.5 placenta, E11.5 AGM, day-6 EB-derived cells, and ESC-HSCs all classified as HSPCs (Figure 3A). Surprisingly, E11.5 AGM hemogenic precursors also scored positively for similarities to macrophages, microglia, and osteoclasts. This likely does not result from contamination because the E11.5 AGM population is uniformly composed of small, blast-like cells that do not resemble macrophages (Taoudi et al., 2005Taoudi S. Morrison A.M. Inoue H. Gribi R. Ure J. Medvinsky A. Progressive divergence of definitive haematopoietic stem cells from the endothelial compartment does not depend on contact with the foetal liver.Development. 2005; 132: 4179-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The set of genes contributing most significantly to the macrophage classification (Figure S3A) is enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes of “cell migration,” “blood vessel development,” and “inflammatory response” (corrected p < 0.01), suggesting that AGM-derived cells and macrophages utilize common genetic programs to facilitate their migratory behavior and that these cells have remnants of their endothelial origin. The FL12 A samples also classified as macrophages, despite being isolated on the basis of a distinct cell surface phenotype that included the depletion of mature hematopoietic lineages, including macrophages. We speculated that differential activity of the regulatory network governing the macrophage program might account for the ability of hemogenic endothelial cells to transiently pass through a macrophage-like transcriptional state. To explore this, we again leveraged the context-dependent GRNs of 44 cell types and tissues, comparing the expression of the macrophage GRN in the AGM and FL-derived HSCs to primary macrophages. The expression of most macrophage positive regulators was unchanged (Figure 3B) in the AGM and FL12 A samples. However, Sfpi1, a master regulator of myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, does not reach the macrophage level of expression (Figure 3B). This is significant because Sfpi1 is autoregulated in differentiated myeloid cells, a mechanism by which cells are able to stabilize transcriptional states (Leddin et al., 2011Leddin M. Perrod C. Hoogenkamp M. Ghani S. Assi S. Heinz S. Wilson N.K. Follows G. Schönheit J. Vockentanz L. et al.Two distinct auto-regulatory loops operate at the PU.1 locus in B cells and myeloid cells.Blood. 2011; 117: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results suggest a model in which nascent HSCs temporarily access a macrophage-related transcriptional program, perhaps to facilitate their migration to the FL. Low Sfpi1 expression may ensure that this state is transient. EB-derived hematopoietic progenitors express c-kit and CD41 (McKinney-Freeman et al., 2008McKinney-Freeman S.L. Lengerke C. Jang I.H. Schmitt S. Wang Y. Philitas M. Shea J. Daley G.Q.

Menendez P. Shojaei F. Li L. Mazurier F. Dick J.E. Cerdan C. Levac K. Bhatia M. Generation of hematopoietic repopulating cells from human embryonic stem cells independent of ectopic HOXB4 expression.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Moreover, retroviral integration site analysis reveals clonal multilineage lymphoid-myeloid engraftment of primary and secondary animals, thereby reflecting the cardinal features of HSCs—self-renewal and multipotency (Wang et al., 2005aWang L. Menendez P. Shojaei F. Li L. Mazurier F. Dick J.E. Cerdan C. Levac K. Bhatia M. Generation of hematopoietic repopulating cells from human embryonic stem cells independent of ectopic HOXB4 expression.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although Cdx-Hox modified EB cells are the most robust ESC-HSCs reported to date, they fail to fully reconstitute the in vivo lymphoid compartment and display an aberrant cell surface phenotype (McKinney-Freeman et al., 2009McKinney-Freeman S.L. Naveiras O. Yates F. Loewer S. Philitas M. Curran M. Park P.J. Daley G.Q. Surface antigen phenotypes of hematopoietic stem cells from embryos and murine embryonic stem cells.Blood. 2009; 114: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A better understanding of how these ESC-HSCs relate to embryonic HSCs would inform protocols for deriving HSCs from PSCs or nonhematopoietic tissues via direct conversion. Thus, we compared the gene expression profiles of CD41BrightCD34−CD45− ESC-HSCs, c-kit+CD41+ day-6 EB-derived cells, and ESCs to the developmental data set (Figure 1 and Table 1). ESC-HSCs clustered mostly tightly with FL and WBM HSCs (Figures 2A and 2B) and were distinct from midgestation in vivo populations (i.e. E9 YS) and their cells of origin (i.e. c-kit+CD41+ EB-derived cells). As anticipated, EB-derived c-kit+CD41+ cells clustered with E9 YS, reflecting the known similarity of EB-derived and YS hematopoiesis (Keller et al., 1993Keller G. Kennedy M. Papayannopoulou T. Wiles M.V. Hematopoietic commitment during embryonic stem cell differentiation in culture.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Thus, despite their aberrant function, ESC-HSCs are most similar to HSC populations with a definitive, adult-like HSC fate. Because the expression of few known HSC regulators fluctuated during HSC ontogeny (Figure S2B), we next assessed differentially expressed genes between each population for enrichment of GO biological processes and canonical signaling pathways (Figures S4A and S4B). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was applied to pair-wise comparisons between all populations and major biological groups (i.e. YS-like, Definitive, and Specifying HSCs). As expected, ESC were enriched in the GO category “negative regulation of cell differentiation,” and all embryonic populations were enriched in active cell cycle categories (e.g., “cell division,” “cell cycle,” and “mitosis”) relative to WBM-HSCs, consistent with their known quiescence (Wilson et al., 2009Wilson A. Laurenti E. Trumpp A. Balancing dormant and self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). VE-cadherin+CD45+ AGM-derived cells were enriched for “cell communication,” “NO biosynthetic processes,” and “positive regulation of angiogenesis” (Figure S4A), reflective of their endothelial origin. AGM and placenta were both enriched for “neutrophil chemotaxis” and “chemotaxis,” suggesting migratory populations. AGM and placenta are also enriched in “inflammatory response” and “response to lipopolysaccharide” (Figure S4A), consistent with a transcriptional resemblance to macrophages (Figure S4A). Analysis of the major biological groups revealed that Specifying HSCs were enriched in chemotaxis, inflammatory response, positive regulation of nitric oxide, biosynthetic process, cell adhesion, positive regulation of angiogenesis, and the ERK cascade, again consistent with an endothelial origin (Figure 4A) (Krens et al., 2008Krens S.F. Corredor-Adámez M. He S. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Spaink H.P.

Erk1 and Erk2 regulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration during mouse embryonic angiogenesis.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether genes regulated in response to the 20 NetPath signaling pathways (Kandasamy et al., 2010Kandasamy K. Mohan S.S. Raju R. Keerthikumar S. Kumar G.S. Venugopal A.K.

Pecquet C. et al.NetPath: a public resource of curated signal transduction pathways.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were enriched in the YS-like, Definitive, and Specifying populations. Each NetPath-annotated signaling pathway has two gene sets: genes upregulated in response to a pathway and genes downregulated. Genes upregulated in response to Wnt and IL-3 signaling were enriched in Specifying HSCs (Figure 4B), in agreement with reports that Wnt and IL-3 signaling promote HSC specification (Goessling et al., 2009Goessling W. North T.E. Loewer S. Lord A.M. Lee S. Stoick-Cooper C.L. Weidinger G. Puder M. Daley G.Q. Moon R.T. Zon L.I.

https://openalex.org/W1964317019,"Resting-state fMRI is a novel approach to measure spontaneous brain activity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Although most resting-state fMRI studies have focused on the examination of temporal correlations between low-frequency oscillations (LFOs), few studies have explored the amplitude of these LFOs in MDD. In this study, we applied the approaches of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF to examine the amplitude of LFOs in MDD.A total of 36 subjects, 18 first-episode, treatment-naive patients with MDD matched with 18 healthy controls (HCs) completed the fMRI scans. Compared with HCs, MDD patients showed increased ALFF in the right fusiform gyrus and the right anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum but decreased ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, and right lingual gyrus. The fALFF in patients was significantly increased in the right precentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, and bilateral anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum but was decreased in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and right inferior parietal lobule. After taking gray matter (GM) volume as a covariate, the results still remained.These findings indicate that MDD patients have altered LFO amplitude in a number of regions distributed over the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices and the cerebellum. These aberrant regions may be related to the disturbances of multiple emotion- and cognition-related networks observed in MDD and the apparent heterogeneity in depressive symptom domains. Such brain functional alteration of MDD may contribute to further understanding of MDD-related network imbalances demonstrated in previous fMRI studies."

https://openalex.org/W1995299616,"The identification of two superluminous supernovae at redshifts of 2.05 and 3.90 extends the present technological redshift limit on supernova detection and presents the possibility of studying the deaths of the first stars to form after the Big Bang. Superluminous supernovae — stellar explosions ten times brighter than type Ia supernovae — were discovered only a few years ago, and are rare in the local Universe. A search for high-redshift supernovae has now identified two superluminous supernovae at redshifts of 2.05 and 3.90, both with slowly evolving light curves. These discoveries imply a production rate of superluminous supernovae at these redshifts at least 10 times greater than that seen in the local Universe, as predicted by theory. In addition, the search technology used has the potential to reveal superluminous supernovae at even greater redshifts, at which point it becomes possible for astronomers to witness the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang. A rare class of ‘superluminous’ supernovae that are about ten or more times more luminous at their peaks than other types of luminous supernova has recently been found at low to intermediate redshifts1,2. A small subset of these events have luminosities that evolve slowly and result in radiated energies of up to about 1051 ergs. Therefore, they are probably examples of ‘pair-instability’ or ‘pulsational pair-instability’ supernovae with estimated progenitor masses of 100 to 250 times that of the Sun3,4,5. These events are exceedingly rare at low redshift, but are expected to be more common at high redshift because the mass distribution of the earliest stars was probably skewed to high values6,7. Here we report the detection of two superluminous supernovae, at redshifts of 2.05 and 3.90, that have slowly evolving light curves. We estimate the rate of events at redshifts of 2 and 4 to be approximately ten times higher than the rate at low redshift. The extreme luminosities of superluminous supernovae extend the redshift limit for supernova detection using present technology, previously 2.36 (ref. 8), and provide a way of investigating the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang."
https://openalex.org/W2067449732,"The oxidation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate by mitochondrial sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) is a major pathway for transfer of cytosolic reducing equivalents to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is known to generate H2O2 at a range of rates and from multiple sites within the chain. The rates and sites depend upon tissue source, concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate and calcium, and the presence of different electron transport chain inhibitors. We report a detailed examination of H2O2 production during glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation by skeletal muscle, brown fat, brain, and heart mitochondria with an emphasis on conditions under which mGPDH itself is the source of superoxide and H2O2. Importantly, we demonstrate that a substantial portion of H2O2 production commonly attributed to mGPDH originates instead from electron flow through the ubiquinone pool into complex II. When complex II is inhibited and mGPDH is the sole superoxide producer, the rate of superoxide production depends on the concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate and calcium and correlates positively with the predicted reduction state of the ubiquinone pool. mGPDH-specific superoxide production plateaus at a rate comparable with the other major sites of superoxide production in mitochondria, the superoxide-producing center shows no sign of being overreducible, and the maximum superoxide production rate correlates with mGPDH activity in four different tissues. mGPDH produces superoxide approximately equally toward each side of the mitochondrial inner membrane, suggesting that the Q-binding pocket of mGPDH is the major site of superoxide generation.

Glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation can drive electrons in both the forward direction from Q through complex III and cytochrome c to complex IV and the reverse direction from Q through complex I to matrix NAD+. This can lead to production of superoxide and H2O2 from multiple sites within mitochondria, including mGPDH, complex I, complex III, and lipoate-linked matrix dehydrogenases (20.Miwa S. St-Pierre J.

The total and site-specific rates of superoxide and H2O2 production depend on the tissue source, the concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate and calcium, and the presence of various electron transport chain inhibitors, making it more difficult to identify superoxide production specifically from mGPDH and to compare effects between groups. Despite numerous attempts, purification of mGPDH has been unsuccessful without significant losses in cofactors and overall activity (15.Cole E.S. Lepp C.A. Holohan P.D. Fondy T.P.

As a result, few mechanistic analyses of enzymatic activity or superoxide production exist. More success has come from pharmacological isolation of mGPDH activity in intact mitochondria to investigate its production of superoxide and H2O2. Most commonly, combinations of complex I and complex III inhibitors (e.g. rotenone and myxothiazol) have been used to prevent production of superoxide from complex I during reverse electron transport and from the outer Q-binding site of complex III (site IIIQo) (21.Miwa S.

These studies identified mGPDH as a likely site of mitochondrial superoxide production and provided evidence that mGPDH generates superoxide to both sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane (20.Miwa S. St-Pierre J. Partridge L. Brand M.D. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by Drosophila mitochondria.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, no study has investigated rigorously the conditions and potential mechanisms that control superoxide production by mGPDH specifically. In the present work, we provide a detailed examination of superoxide and H2O2 production during glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation by mitochondria from rat skeletal muscle, brown fat, brain, and heart, with an emphasis on conditions under which mGPDH itself is the source of superoxide. During our characterization, we discovered that much of the measured H2O2 commonly attributed to mGPDH actually originates from the flow of electrons from the mobile Q-pool into complex II. Inhibitors of complex II prevent this flow without inhibiting mGPDH or other aspects of mitochondrial activity. Using refined conditions where mGPDH is pharmacologically isolated as the superoxide producer, we find that the rate of H2O2 production varies with the concentration of glycerol 3-phosphate and calcium in a manner that correlates positively with the predicted reduction state of the Q-pool and with the expected total activity of mGPDH. Further, the superoxide-producing center of mGPDH shows no sign of being overreducible. Topological assessment indicates that the major reactive species produced by mGPDH is superoxide that is released approximately equally to each side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This topology favors the Q-binding pocket in the outer leaflet as being the primary site of superoxide generation in mGPDH.

Freshly isolated heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria were assayed in buffer containing 120 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin without or with added CaCl2 to yield a final free concentration of 250 nm calcium at pH 7.0 at 37 °C.

Experiments were performed at 37 °C except for measurement of aconitase activity, which was assayed at 30 °C. Rates of superoxide and H2O2 production were quantified fluorometrically as H2O2, without distinguishing between them, in the presence of exogenous superoxide dismutase, horseradish peroxidase, and Amplex UltraRed, as described previously (29.Affourtit C.

Amplex UltraRed fluorescence was measured on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (excitation at 550 nm, emission at 590 nm). Briefly, 0.1–0.3 mg of mitochondria/ml were stirred continuously at 37 °C with all assay components present from the start except for substrate, which was added after 2–5 min of equilibration. Direct comparisons of variables like substrate concentration, calcium concentration, or the presence/absence of inhibitors were tested in parallel cuvettes except for the illustrative experiment in Fig. 2b. Rates of fluorescence change were measured once steady state was attained for each condition, typically within 3–4 min after substrate addition. Fluorescence changes were calibrated to H2O2 standards assayed under identical conditions (33.St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The concentration of glycerol phosphate significantly affected these calibrations (Fig. 1a) independently of other variables (i.e. the presence or absence of mitochondria, calcium, or various mitochondrial inhibitors). If uncorrected, this effect resulted in an overestimation in the calculated rates of H2O2 production. Therefore, to determine true rates of H2O2 production, a correction factor proportional to the percentage change versus no glycerol phosphate added was applied to calibration slopes (measured as fluorescence units/pmol of H2O2 added) for each concentration of glycerol phosphate greater than 1 mm. This effect of glycerol phosphate on the calibration was verified periodically to ensure the consistency of these corrections over the course of all experiments. All rates were determined empirically except for those in Fig. 8, which were corrected for H2O2 consumption by endogenous peroxidases according to Ref. 35.Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L.

Maximal rates of site-specific H2O2/superoxide production were measured in brown fat mitochondria (Fig. 8b). The maximal rate from mGPDH was determined as above but without CDNB pretreatment. The flavin mononucleotide site of complex I (site IF) was driven using 5 mm malate in the presence of 4 μm rotenone as described (35.Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L.

https://openalex.org/W2006277271,"The crystal structure of the Mediator head module from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is solved at 3.4 Å resolution. The Mediator complex has a central role in gene regulation, linking RNA polymerase II to its many transcriptional regulators. The structure of the budding yeast seven-subunit Mediator head module indicated three domains: the neck, fixed jaw and moveable jaw. Patrick Cramer and colleagues have determined the structure of the fission yeast head module at 3.4 Å resolution. The enhanced resolution allows refinement of interpretations of the initial structure and emphasizes the flexibility of the head module. The highly conserved structure is flexible, and the localization of known mutations permits the attribution of function to some regions of the molecule. Gene transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) II requires the coactivator complex Mediator. Mediator connects transcriptional regulators and Pol II, and is linked to human disease1,2,3,4. Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a molecular mass of 1.4 megadaltons and comprises 25 subunits that form the head, middle, tail and kinase modules5,6,7. The head module constitutes one-half of the essential Mediator core8, and comprises the conserved9 subunits Med6, Med8, Med11, Med17, Med18, Med20 and Med22. Recent X-ray analysis of the S. cerevisiae head module at 4.3 Å resolution led to a partial architectural model with three submodules called neck, fixed jaw and moveable jaw10. Here we determine de novo the crystal structure of the head module from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 Å resolution. Structure solution was enabled by new structures of Med6 and the fixed jaw, and previous structures of the moveable jaw11 and part of the neck12, and required deletion of Med20. The S. pombe head module resembles the head of a crocodile with eight distinct elements, of which at least four are mobile. The fixed jaw comprises tooth and nose domains, whereas the neck submodule contains a helical spine and one limb, with shoulder, arm and finger elements. The arm and the essential shoulder contact other parts of Mediator. The jaws and a central joint are implicated in interactions with Pol II and its carboxy-terminal domain, and the joint is required for transcription in vitro. The S. pombe head module structure leads to a revised model of the S. cerevisiae module, reveals a high conservation and flexibility, explains known mutations, and provides the basis for unravelling a central mechanism of gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2063383694,"The question of why some introduced species become invasive and others do not is the central puzzle of invasion biology. Two of the principal explanations for this phenomenon concern functional traits: invasive species may have higher values of competitively advantageous traits than non-invasive species, or they may have greater phenotypic plasticity in traits that permits them to survive the colonization period and spread to a broad range of environments. Although there is a large body of evidence for superiority in particular traits among invasive plants, when compared to phylogenetically related non-invasive plants, it is less clear if invasive plants are more phenotypically plastic, and whether this plasticity confers a fitness advantage. In this study, I used a model group of 10 closely related Pinus species whose invader or non-invader status has been reliably characterized to test the relative contribution of high trait values and high trait plasticity to relative growth rate, a performance measure standing in as a proxy for fitness. When grown at higher nitrogen supply, invaders had a plastic RGR response, increasing their RGR to a much greater extent than non-invaders. However, invasive species did not exhibit significantly more phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species for any of 17 functional traits, and trait plasticity indices were generally weakly correlated with RGR. Conversely, invasive species had higher values than non-invaders for 13 of the 17 traits, including higher leaf area ratio, photosynthetic capacity, photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency, and nutrient uptake rates, and these traits were also strongly correlated with performance. I conclude that, in responding to higher N supply, superior trait values coupled with a moderate degree of trait variation explain invasive species' superior performance better than plasticity per se."

Since membrane association is essential for Ras biological activity, we developed a high content assay for inhibitors of Ras plasma membrane localization.

Staurosporines are more active against K-Ras than H-Ras. K-Ras is displaced to endosomes and undergoes proteasomal-independent degradation, whereas H-Ras redistributes to the Golgi and is not degraded. K-Ras nanoclustering on the plasma membrane is also inhibited. Ras mislocalization does not correlate with protein kinase C inhibition or induction of apoptosis. Staurosporines selectively abrogate K-Ras signaling and proliferation of K-Ras-transformed cells.

Ilagan M.X. The canonical Notch signaling pathway: unfolding the activation mechanism.Cell. 2009; 137: 216-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). Canonical Notch signaling involves activation of the Notch transmembrane receptor (Notch1–4 in mammals) by the binding of one of its ligands (Dll1/3/4 and Jagged1/2 in mammals), which are expressed on the cell surface of adjacent cells. Upon binding, Notch receptor is sequentially cleaved by an ADAM family metalloprotease and the γ-Secretase complex, resulting in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates into the nucleus and binds the transcription factor RBP-J, releasing repressive cofactors and recruiting transcription machinery to activate RBP-J target genes. Notch plays a complicated role during organogenesis and tissue homeostasis (Chiba, 2006Chiba S. Notch signaling in stem cell systems.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).

To add to the complexity, the biological consequence of Notch activation can be distinct at different developmental stages. For example, Notch activation suppresses the differentiation of murine intestinal stem cells in embryos, but inhibits secretory fates of intestinal stem cells in the adult (Stanger et al., 2005Stanger B.Z. Datar R. Murtaugh L.C. Melton D.A. Direct regulation of intestinal fate by Notch.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 12443-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The majority of Notch-related studies in the prostate focused on its function during embryonic and neonatal stages. Developmentally, the prostate originates from a hindgut-derived endodermal tube termed urogenital sinus (UGS) (Staack et al., 2003Staack A. Donjacour A.A. Brody J. Cunha G.R. Carroll P. Mouse urogenital development: a practical approach.Differentiation. 2003; 71: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Prostatic morphogenesis starts at E17 in mice when the UGS epithelia (UGSE) protrude into the surrounding mesenchyme. The UGSE cells are the putative embryonic prostate epithelial stem cells and express both Keratin 5 (K5) and Keratin 8 (K8). Subsequently, the UGSE modules canalize to form lumens. UGSE cells undergo lineage commitment by selectively losing one of the keratins to form K8-expressing luminal cells surrounding the lumen and K5-expressing basal cells that reside between the basement membrane and luminal cells (Wang et al., 2001Wang Y. Hayward S. Cao M. Thayer K. Cunha G. Cell differentiation lineage in the prostate.Differentiation. 2001; 68: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Pharmacological suppression of Notch signaling in in vitro cultured UGS inhibits UGSE differentiation and blocks basal and luminal cell lineage commitment (Orr et al., 2009Orr B. Grace O.C.

In another study, disrupting Rbp-j in embryonic prostate epithelial cells caused defects in epithelial stratification and a reduction in basal cell number (Wu et al., 2011Wu X. Xu K. Zhang L. Deng Y.

Differentiation of the ductal epithelium and smooth muscle in the prostate gland are regulated by the Notch/PTEN-dependent mechanism.Dev. Biol. 2011; 356: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The function of Notch in adult prostate epithelial homeostasis has not been as well characterized. Studies in recent years demonstrated that adult prostate basal and luminal cells are mainly self-sustained independently in vivo, but basal cells display prominent multipotent stem cell activity in a transplantation-based regeneration assay (Burger et al., 2005Burger P.E.

Notch1-expressing cells are indispensable for functional regeneration of adult prostate, which implies a potential role for Notch signaling in the regenerative capacity of prostate epithelia (Wang et al., 2004Wang X.D. Shou J. Wong P. French D.M. Gao W.Q. Notch1-expressing cells are indispensable for prostatic branching morphogenesis during development and re-growth following castration and androgen replacement.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24733-24744Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We previously showed that Wnt signaling induces prostate basal cell proliferation by downregulating Notch signaling (Shahi et al., 2011Shahi P. Seethammagari M.R. Valdez J.M. Xin L. Spencer D.M. Wnt and Notch pathways have interrelated opposing roles on prostate progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ectopic Notch activation has also been shown to result in a benign prostate hyperplasia phenotype in vivo (Wu et al., 2011Wu X. Xu K. Zhang L. Deng Y. Lee P. Shapiro E. Monaco M. Makarenkova H.P. Li J. Lepor H. Grishina I. Differentiation of the ductal epithelium and smooth muscle in the prostate gland are regulated by the Notch/PTEN-dependent mechanism.Dev. Biol. 2011; 356: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the expression pattern of Notch signaling components and the functional role of Notch in different prostate epithelial lineages in adults still remain understudied. Prostate epithelial cells turn over very slowly. The quiescence of prostate epithelia is the overall net outcome of a variety of signaling networks that are often regulated by stromal-epithelial interactions (Marker et al., 2003Marker P.C. Donjacour A.A. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Hormonal, cellular, and molecular control of prostatic development.Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Among those signaling networks, TGFβ is one of the most extensively investigated signal transduction pathways. TGFβ has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining prostatic basal stem cell quiescence. Prostatic stem cells are enriched in the proximal region of the prostate that is anatomically adjacent to the urethra (Burger et al., 2005Burger P.E. Xiong X. Coetzee S. Salm S.N. Moscatelli D. Goto K. Wilson E.L. Sca-1 expression identifies stem cells in the proximal region of prostatic ducts with high capacity to reconstitute prostatic tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 7180-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar; Lawson et al., 2007Lawson D.A. Xin L. Lukacs R.U. Cheng D. Witte O.N. Isolation and functional characterization of murine prostate stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A large band of smooth muscle that secretes high levels of TGFβ envelops this proximal region (Nemeth and Lee, 1996Nemeth J.A. Lee C. Prostatic ductal system in rats: regional variation in stromal organization.Prostate. 1996; 28: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Salm et al. have shown that TGFβ can inhibit the proliferation of prostatic epithelial cells, and that the concentration and activity of TGFβ is higher in the proximal region, which contributes to the replicative quiescent nature of prostate stem cells (Salm et al., 2005Salm S.N. Burger P.E. Coetzee S. Goto K. Moscatelli D. Wilson E.L. TGF-beta maintains dormancy of prostatic stem cells in the proximal region of ducts.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). TGFβ signaling has been specifically disrupted in prostate epithelia. Surprisingly, no distinctive changes in cellular proliferation were observed when TGFβR2 (Placencio et al., 2008Placencio V.R. Sharif-Afshar A.R. Li X. Huang H. Uwamariya C. Neilson E.G. Shen M.M. Matusik R.J. Hayward S.W. Bhowmick N.A. Stromal transforming growth factor-beta signaling mediates prostatic response to androgen ablation by paracrine Wnt activity.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4709-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or SMAD4 (Ding et al., 2011Ding Z. Wu C.J. Chu G.C. Xiao Y. Ho D. Zhang J. Perry S.R. Labrot E.S. Wu X. Lis R. et al.SMAD4-dependent barrier constrains prostate cancer growth and metastatic progression.Nature. 2011; 470: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) were ablated in the prostate, while only a very mild increase in prostate epithelial proliferation was reported when a dominant-negative TGFβR2 was ectopically expressed (Kundu et al., 2000Kundu S.D. Kim I.Y. Yang T. Doglio L. Lang S. Zhang X. Buttyan R. Kim S.J. Chang J. Cai X. et al.Absence of proximal duct apoptosis in the ventral prostate of transgenic mice carrying the C3(1)-TGF-beta type II dominant negative receptor.Prostate. 2000; 43: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This implies the existence of other signaling pathways that are redundant to TGFβ, among which Notch is one (Kluppel and Wrana, 2005Kluppel M. Wrana J.L. Turning it up a Notch: cross-talk between TGF beta and Notch signaling.BioEssays. 2005; 27: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This study aims to investigate the role of Notch in adult prostate epithelial maintenance and differentiation, and to unveil how Notch and TGFβ coordinate together to regulate these biological processes. To gain insight into how Notch signaling is activated in the prostate, we determined the expression pattern of a comprehensive collection of Notch signaling components in prostate basal and luminal cell lineages by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Individual adult murine prostate cell lineages were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on their surface antigenic expression profiles as described previously (Lawson et al., 2007Lawson D.A. Xin L. Lukacs R.U. Cheng D. Witte O.N. Isolation and functional characterization of murine prostate stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). qRT-PCR analyses showed that transcripts for the basal cell marker P63, the luminal cell marker Nkx3.1, and the stromal cell marker Vimentin were enriched in their corresponding cell fractions, demonstrating successful cell fractionation (Figure 1B). A pathway-focused PCR array was utilized to determine the expression of 84 Notch-signaling-related genes in the prostate basal and luminal epithelial cell lineages (Figure 1C). Notch1 and Notch2 are the most highly expressed receptors in both prostate basal and luminal cells. Jagged1 (Jag1) is the most highly expressed Notch ligand and is highly enriched in basal cells. Interestingly, although Dll1 and Jag2 were expressed at lower levels, they are also preferentially expressed in basal cells. Dll3 and Dll4 were undetectable (data not shown). Notch processing components such as ADAM metalloproteases and γ-Secretase complex members, as well as signal modulators such as Numb, NCoR2, and the Fringe family members, were widely expressed in both cell lineages. Lastly, downstream canonical Notch target genes Hes1, Hey1, and HeyL and the transcription factor Rbp-j were expressed in both basal and luminal compartments. Collectively, these results suggest that Notch signaling is active in at least a fraction of cells in both basal and luminal epithelial cells of the prostate, and that basal cells express ligands that may activate Notch signaling in adjacent basal and luminal cells. To investigate whether Notch signaling plays a role in the maintenance of adult murine prostate epithelial homeostasis, we ablated Notch signaling specifically in the prostate by breeding Rbp-jf/f mice (Han et al., 2002Han H. Tanigaki K. Yamamoto N. Kuroda K. Yoshimoto M. Nakahata T. Ikuta K. Honjo T. Inducible gene knockout of transcription factor recombination signal binding protein-J reveals its essential role in T versus B lineage decision.Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) (hereafter referred to as WT mice) with ARR2PB-Cre mice (Jin et al., 2003Jin C. McKeehan K. Wang F. Transgenic mouse with high Cre recombinase activity in all prostate lobes, seminal vesicle, and ductus deferens.Prostate. 2003; 57: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to generate ARR2PB-Cre; Rbp-J f/f mice (hereafter referred to as KO mice). Using a fluorescence reporter-based strategy, we demonstrated that ARR2PB-Cre mediates homologous recombination in both luminal and basal epithelial cells in the prostate (Figure S1A available online). Expression of Rbp-j in KO mouse prostates was decreased by half as determined by qRT-PCR (Figure 2A). Genomic analyses of the floxed exon 6 of Rbp-j revealed approximately 30% deletion in both basal and luminal lineages (Figure 2B). Consistently, qRT-PCR analyses also confirmed a 65% and 96% decrease in Rbp-j transcript in FACS-sorted KO prostate basal cells and in prostate spheres derived from KO mouse prostate basal cells, respectively (Figure 2C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Rbp-j was deleted in both the prostate basal and luminal cell lineages. No defects in morphogenesis, lineage composition, or cellular turnover were observed in adult KO mice, suggesting that RBP-J-mediated canonical Notch signaling is dispensable for the maintenance of prostate epithelial homeostasis (Figures 2D, S1B and S1C). We then investigated whether Notch regulates lineage proliferation and differentiation during tissue regeneration. To induce extensive cellular turnover in the prostate, androgen was deprived and replaced for two cycles in adult WT and KO mice as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. KO mouse prostates were able to involute and regenerate similarly to WT prostates in response to fluctuating serum testosterone levels, suggesting that RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling is not essential for the regenerative capacity of prostate epithelia (Figure S1D). Alternatively, recombination-escaped cells may be sufficient to maintain the homeostasis and the regenerative potential of KO prostates. However, we observed a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the number of K5+ or P63+ basal cells in the KO mice (Figure 2E). This expansion in basal cells is due to an increase in proliferation as measured by Ki67 (Figures 2F and 2G), and not a decrease in apoptosis (data not shown). In contrast, there is only a slight, but not statistically significant, increase in proliferation in the P63− cells (Figure 2F). This minor increase is probably due to the inclusion of the proliferation of P63− basal cells because no change in proliferation is observed in the nonbasal cells when cytokeratin14 (K14), another more inclusive basal cell marker, was used in the analysis (Figure 2G). Taken together these data demonstrate that, in the absence of canonical Notch signaling, basal cells overproliferate during prostate regeneration. We employed an in vitro prostate sphere assay (Xin et al., 2007Xin L. Lukacs R.U. Lawson D.A. Cheng D. Witte O.N. Self-renewal and multilineage differentiation in vitro from murine prostate stem cells.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2760-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to further investigate how Notch signaling regulates basal cell proliferation and differentiation. FACS isolated adult murine prostate basal cells were cultured in the prostate sphere assay with or without N-[(3,5-Difluorophenyl)acetyl]-L-alanyl-2-phenyl]glycine-1,1-dimethylethyl ester (DAPT), an inhibitor of the γ-Secretase complex. DAPT effectively suppressed the generation of NICD and the expression of Notch downstream targets Hes1 and Hey1 in prostate sphere cells (Figures 3A and 3B ). Higher concentrations of DAPT are not able to further decrease NICD formation, suggesting that this reduction may be maximal for this assay (Figure S2A). Spheres treated with DAPT are larger and appear hyperbudded (Figure 3C and Figure S2B) (Shahi et al., 2011Shahi P. Seethammagari M.R. Valdez J.M. Xin L. Spencer D.M. Wnt and Notch pathways have interrelated opposing roles on prostate progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, prostate cells from RBP-J KO animals (Figure 3D) and prostate cells expressing a dominant-negative mastermind-like protein (dnMAML) (Maillard et al., 2008Maillard I. Koch U. Dumortier A. Shestova O. Xu L. Sai H. Pross S.E. Aster J.C. Bhandoola A. Radtke F. Pear W.S. Canonical notch signaling is dispensable for the maintenance of adult hematopoietic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 356-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) that blocks Notch signaling (Figures 3E and S2C) both show a similar sphere phenotype, confirming that the large hyperbudded phenotype is due to the suppression of Notch and not other DAPT targets. Lastly, overexpressing NICD in prostate spheres suppressed the DAPT-induced phenotype (Figures 3F and S2D). Collectively, these results suggest that the large hyperbudding phenotype is a direct consequence of inhibition of Notch signaling. Gene expression profiling of prostate spheres reveals that the cell cycle gene ontology group is significantly altered between vehicle- and DAPT-treated prostate spheres, of which several major targets were verified by qRT-PCR (Figures 4A, 4B, and S3A). Cell cycle analysis confirmed that cells treated with DAPT were enriched in S and G2/M phases compared to the vehicle control (Figure 4C). To investigate the biological consequence of Notch activation in prostate basal cells in vivo, we bred ARR2PB-Cre mice with ROSA(N1IC) transgenic mice (Stanger et al., 2005Stanger B.Z. Datar R. Murtaugh L.C. Melton D.A. Direct regulation of intestinal fate by Notch.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 12443-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) to express the constitutively active Notch1 intracellular domain in prostate epithelium (Figure S3B). As shown in Figure 4D, while Notch activation induces a hyperplastic growth of luminal cells, the number of basal cells is decreased, as quantified by FACS analysis in Figure 4E. Ectopic expression of NICD in FACS isolated adult mouse prostate basal cells by lentiviral infection did not induce their luminal differentiation (Figure S3C). This suggests that the skewed lineage composition in the ARR2PB-ROSA(N1IC) model is not due to a luminal fate bias of prostate stem cells by Notch activation. Instead, it suggests that Notch activation elicits distinctive growth outcomes in prostate basal and luminal cell lineages. Taken together these data suggest that Notch signaling negatively regulates the proliferation of prostate basal cells. Cells in the outermost layers of prostate spheres express P63, possess a higher replating capacity, and represent more primitive progenitor cells (Xin et al., 2007Xin L. Lukacs R.U. Lawson D.A. Cheng D. Witte O.N. Self-renewal and multilineage differentiation in vitro from murine prostate stem cells.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2760-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, DAPT-treated spheres express P63 throughout the entirety of the sphere (Figure 5A). We reasoned that inhibiting Notch signaling in prostate spheres not only increases their proliferation, but also attenuates their differentiation. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that Psca and Ar, two markers for differentiation, were markedly decreased in the DAPT-treated spheres (Figure 5B). Di-hydro-testosterone (DHT) has been shown to further induce differentiation of prostate sphere cells (Xin et al., 2007Xin L. Lukacs R.U. Lawson D.A. Cheng D. Witte O.N. Self-renewal and multilineage differentiation in vitro from murine prostate stem cells.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2760-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). DHT induces dilation of the sphere lumen, resulting in morphologically hollow prostate spheres (Figure 5C). In addition, while in DHT-free prostate sphere culture most spheres are composed predominantly of K5+K8− cells (type I), DHT increases the proportion of spheres that consist of nests of K5−K8+ cells in the center (type II) or spheres that are mainly composed of K5−K8+ cells (type III) (Figure 5D). DAPT treatment effectively suppresses the formation of DHT-induced lumen formation and the formation of type II and III spheres (Figures 5C and 5D). These results suggest that inhibiting Notch signaling suppresses the differentiation of prostate basal stem/progenitor cells. We then performed serial passaging experiments to functionally test whether inhibition of Notch signaling would increase the percentage of progenitor cells in prostate spheres. Treating dissociated primary prostate epithelial cells with DAPT did not increase the sphere-forming unit, indicating that DAPT treatment per se does not confer sphere-forming activity (Figure 5E). No significant differences in biology were noticed when higher concentrations of DAPT were used (Figure S4). The control and DAPT-treated primary spheres were then dissociated and passaged in bulk in the absence of DAPT. DAPT-treated spheres generated more secondary spheres compared to the control spheres, suggesting that there are more sphere-forming cells in the DAPT-treated primary culture (Figure 5F). We also dissociated single spheres and passaged them separately and found that the average sphere-forming unit within single DAPT-treated spheres is approximately 3-fold higher than that of the control spheres (Figure 5G). These results demonstrate that ablating Notch activity results in the expansion of sphere-forming progenitor cells. Finally, FACS sorted prostate basal cells from WT and RBP-J KO mice were mixed with UGS mesenchyme and injected subcutaneously into SCID mice to regenerate prostatic tissues (Xin et al., 2003Xin L. Ide H. Kim Y. Dubey P. Witte O.N. In vivo regeneration of murine prostate from dissociated cell populations of postnatal epithelia and urogenital sinus mesenchyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11896-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The KO basal cells formed prostate glands containing more K5+ cells (Figure 5H), further corroborating that Notch ablation induces expansion of basal cells in vivo during regeneration. Because Notch ablation only induced prostate basal cell proliferation when basal cells were cultured alone in vitro or when they underwent regeneration due to changes in their environmental cues, we reasoned that Notch coordinates with signaling mediated by prostate stromal cells to regulate basal cell homeostasis. Our expression microarray data show that the TGFβ signaling pathway ontology group is significantly downregulated in the DAPT-treated group, which was verified by qRT-PCR (Figures 6A, 6B, and S5A). TGFβ signaling plays a critical role in prostate epithelial quiescence (Salm et al., 2005Salm S.N. Burger P.E. Coetzee S. Goto K. Moscatelli D. Wilson E.L. TGF-beta maintains dormancy of prostatic stem cells in the proximal region of ducts.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and its signaling strength is negatively regulated by androgen (Nantermet et al., 2004Nantermet P.V. Xu J. Yu Y. Hodor P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1310-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, Notch and TGFβ signaling have been shown to interact in regulating cellular quiescence in a variety of tissues (Blokzijl et al., 2003Blokzijl A. Dahlqvist C. Reissmann E. Falk A.

https://openalex.org/W2141457299,"The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac anomaly and is frequently associated with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). The most prevalent type-I morphology, which results from left-/right-coronary cusp fusion, generates different hemodynamics than a tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). While valvular calcification has been linked to genetic and atherogenic predispositions, hemodynamic abnormalities are increasingly pointed as potential pathogenic contributors. In particular, the wall shear stress (WSS) produced by blood flow on the leaflets regulates homeostasis in the TAV. In contrast, WSS alterations cause valve dysfunction and disease. While such observations support the existence of synergies between valvular hemodynamics and biology, the role played by BAV WSS in valvular calcification remains unknown. The objective of this study was to isolate the acute effects of native BAV WSS abnormalities on CAVD pathogenesis. Porcine aortic valve leaflets were subjected ex vivo to the native WSS experienced by TAV and type-I BAV leaflets for 48 hours. Immunostaining, immunoblotting and zymography were performed to characterize endothelial activation, pro-inflammatory paracrine signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling and markers involved in valvular interstitial cell activation and osteogenesis. While TAV and non-coronary BAV leaflet WSS essentially maintained valvular homeostasis, fused BAV leaflet WSS promoted fibrosa endothelial activation, paracrine signaling (2.4-fold and 3.7-fold increase in BMP-4 and TGF-β1, respectively, relative to fresh controls), catabolic enzyme secretion (6.3-fold, 16.8-fold, 11.7-fold, 16.7-fold and 5.5-fold increase in MMP-2, MMP-9, cathepsin L, cathepsin S and TIMP-2, respectively) and activity (1.7-fold and 2.4-fold increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, respectively), and bone matrix synthesis (5-fold increase in osteocalcin). In contrast, BAV WSS did not significantly affect α-SMA and Runx2 expressions and TIMP/MMP ratio. This study demonstrates the key role played by BAV hemodynamic abnormalities in CAVD pathogenesis and suggests the dependence of BAV vulnerability to calcification on the local degree of WSS abnormality."
https://openalex.org/W2057271193,"RNA-sequencing and tailored bioinformatic methodologies have paved the way for identification of expressed fusion genes from the chaotic genomes of solid tumors. We have recently successfully exploited RNA-sequencing for the discovery of 24 novel fusion genes in breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate the importance of continuous optimization of the bioinformatic methodology for this purpose, and report the discovery and experimental validation of 13 additional fusion genes from the same samples. Integration of copy number profiling with the RNA-sequencing results revealed that the majority of the gene fusions were promoter-donating events that occurred at copy number transition points or involved high-level DNA-amplifications. Sequencing of genomic fusion break points confirmed that DNA-level rearrangements underlie selected fusion transcripts. Furthermore, a significant portion (>60%) of the fusion genes were alternatively spliced. This illustrates the importance of reanalyzing sequencing data as gene definitions change and bioinformatic methods improve, and highlights the previously unforeseen isoform diversity among fusion transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W2066876478,"In this study, we cloned, expressed and functionally characterized Stronglycentrotus purpuratus (Sp) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. This screen identified three multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters with functional homology to the major types of MDR transporters found in humans. When overexpressed in embryos, the apical transporters Sp-ABCB1a, ABCB4a, and ABCG2a can account for as much as 87% of the observed efflux activity, providing a robust assay for their substrate selectivity. Using this assay, we found that sea urchin MDR transporters export canonical MDR susbtrates such as calcein-AM, bodipy-verapamil, bodipy-vinblastine, and mitoxantrone. In addition, we characterized the impact of nonconservative substitutions in the primary sequences of drug binding domains of sea urchin versus murine ABCB1 by mutation of Sp-ABCB1a and treatment of embryos with stereoisomeric cyclic peptide inhibitors (QZ59 compounds). The results indicated that two substitutions in transmembrane helix 6 reverse stereoselectivity of Sp-ABCB1a for QZ59 enantiomers compared with mouse ABCB1a. This suggests that subtle changes in the primary sequence of transporter drug binding domains could fine-tune substrate specificity through evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2009605610,"In adult stem cell lineages, progenitor cells commonly undergo mitotic transit amplifying (TA) divisions before terminal differentiation, allowing production of many differentiated progeny per stem cell division. Mechanisms that limit TA divisions and trigger the switch to differentiation may protect against cancer by preventing accumulation of oncogenic mutations in the proliferating population. Here we show that the switch from TA proliferation to differentiation in the Drosophila male germline stem cell lineage is mediated by translational control. The TRIM-NHL tumor suppressor homolog Mei-P26 facilitates accumulation of the differentiation regulator Bam in TA cells. In turn, Bam and its partner Bgcn bind the mei-P26 3′ untranslated region and repress translation of mei-P26 in late TA cells. Thus, germ cells progress through distinct, sequential regulatory states, from Mei-P26 on/Bam off to Bam on/Mei-P26 off.

In many adult stem cell lineages, stem cell daughters destined for differentiation first undergo a limited number of mitotic divisions to amplify cell number prior to terminal differentiation. This transit amplifying (TA) division strategy may protect large long-lived animals from tumorigenesis by minimizing the number of stem cell divisions required for tissue homeostasis and preventing accumulation of oncogenic mutations in progenitor cells due to programmed differentiation. The mechanisms that limit the number of TA divisions and initiate terminal differentiation thus may provide tumor suppressor function, and defects may contribute to progression toward cancer in adult stem cell lineages (Clarke and Fuller, 2006Clarke M.F.

Here we investigate the mechanisms that force TA cells to stop proliferating and initiate terminal differentiation in the Drosophila male germline adult stem cell lineage. Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs) reside in a niche at the tip of the testis, attached to somatic hub cells and flanked by somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) (Figure 1A) (Fuller and Spradling, 2007Fuller M.T. Spradling A.C. Male and female Drosophila germline stem cells: two versions of immortality.Science. 2007; 316: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). When a GSC divides, one daughter remains in the niche and self-renews, while the other is displaced away and initiates differentiation. The resulting gonialblast, which is enveloped by a pair of CySCs, proceeds through four synchronous TA divisions with incomplete cytokinesis, producing a clone of 16 interconnected germ cells. These 16 mitotic sisters normally stop proliferating, undergo premeiotic DNA synthesis in synchrony, and switch to the spermatocyte program of cell growth, meiosis, and terminal differentiation (Figure 1A) (Fuller, 1993Fuller M.T. Spermatogenesis.in: Martinez-Arias M.B.A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1993: 71-147Google Scholar). Because TA sister cells are contained within a common somatic cell envelope, are joined by cytoplasmic bridges, and divide in synchrony, mutations that cause overproliferation of TA cells can be easily identified. The bag of marbles (bam) gene is required cell autonomously for TA spermatogonia to stop proliferating and enter the spermatocyte differentiation program. Male germ cells mutant for bam undergo several extra rounds of mitotic TA division, fail to differentiate, and eventually die (Gönczy et al., 1997Gönczy P. Matunis E.

Spradling A.C. bag-of-marbles: a Drosophila gene required to initiate both male and female gametogenesis.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2242-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The number of TA divisions appears to be set by the time required for Bam protein to accumulate to a critical threshold. Bam protein is normally first detected in 4-cell cysts, increases to a peak in 8-cell cysts, and is degraded in early 16-cell cysts immediately after premeiotic DNA replication. Lowering the bam dosage slowed Bam protein accumulation and delayed the transition to differentiation, whereas early accumulation of Bam protein caused a premature switch to differentiation (Insco et al., 2009Insco M.L. Leon A. Tam C.H. McKearin D.M. Fuller M.T. Accumulation of a differentiation regulator specifies transit amplifying division number in an adult stem cell lineage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 22311-22316Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bam, a protein with no recognizable domains, acts with a partner, benign gonial cell neoplasm (Bgcn), discovered in a genetic screen for Drosophila tumor suppressors (Gateff, 1994Gateff E. Tumor suppressor and overgrowth suppressor genes of Drosophila melanogaster: developmental aspects.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 565-590PubMed Google Scholar). bam and bgcn have similar mutant phenotypes (Gönczy et al., 1997Gönczy P. Matunis E. DiNardo S. bag-of-marbles and benign gonial cell neoplasm act in the germline to restrict proliferation during Drosophila spermatogenesis.Development. 1997; 124: 4361-4371PubMed Google Scholar), and Bam protein directly interacts with Bgcn in Drosophila ovaries or when coexpressed in cultured cells or yeast (Li et al., 2009Li Y. Minor N.T. Park J.K. McKearin D.M. Maines J.Z. Bam and Bgcn antagonize Nanos-dependent germ-line stem cell maintenance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9304-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; Shen et al., 2009Shen R. Weng C. Yu J.

USA. 2009; 106: 11623-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Bgcn is related to the DExH-box family of RNA-dependent helicases, indicating that Bgcn, and with it Bam, may regulate RNA. Consistent with a role in translational repression, Bam protein binds the translation initiation factor eIF4A. Furthermore, expression of Bam and Bgcn in Drosophila cultured cells resulted in a 4-fold reduction in expression of a luciferase reporter coupled to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of e-cadherin messenger RNA (mRNA), and tethering Bam to the 3′ UTR induced translational repression of the attached reporter (Shen et al., 2009Shen R. Weng C. Yu J. Xie T. eIF4A controls germline stem cell self-renewal by directly inhibiting BAM function in the Drosophila ovary.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 11623-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In female germ cells, Bam and Bgcn allow the onset of differentiation through translational repression of nanos (nos) via the nos 3′ UTR (Li et al., 2009Li Y. Minor N.T. Park J.K. McKearin D.M. Maines J.Z. Bam and Bgcn antagonize Nanos-dependent germ-line stem cell maintenance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9304-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, direct interaction of Bam or Bgcn protein with e-cadherin or nos mRNAs has not been demonstrated. Here we identify the microRNA (miRNA) regulator and TRIM-NHL (tripartite motif and Ncl-1, HT2a, and Lin-41 domain) family member Mei-P26 (Neumüller et al., 2008Neumüller R.A. Betschinger J. Fischer A. Bushati N. Poernbacher I. Mechtler K. Cohen S.M. Knoblich J.A. Mei-P26 regulates microRNAs and cell growth in the Drosophila ovarian stem cell lineage.Nature. 2008; 454: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar; Page et al., 2000Page S.L. McKim K.S. Deneen B. Van Hook T.L. Hawley R.S. Genetic studies of mei-P26 reveal a link between the processes that control germ cell proliferation in both sexes and those that control meiotic exchange in Drosophila.Genetics. 2000; 155: 1757-1772PubMed Google Scholar) both as a regulator of Bam protein accumulation and, subsequently, as a direct target of translational repression by Bam and Bgcn in male germ cells. Mei-P26 function facilitates both the switch from mitosis to meiosis and spermatocyte differentiation. In mei-P26 mutant males, Bam protein failed to accumulate to its normal peak levels. The overproliferation of TA cells in mei-P26 mutant testes was suppressed by expression of additional Bam, suggesting that the continued TA cell proliferation in mei-P26 mutant males is due to the failure of Bam protein to reach the threshold required for the switch to the spermatocyte state. In turn, Bam specifically binds the mei-P26 3′ UTR, and Bam and Bgcn function are required for translational repression of mei-P26 via its 3′ UTR in vivo. Mutating two potential let-7 target sites within the mei-P26 3′ UTR derepressed reporter expression in vivo and disrupted Bam binding in vitro. Our data suggest that a stepwise progression in regulatory states from [Mei-P26 on/Bam off] to [Mei-P26 on/Bam on] to [Bam on/Mei-P26 off], choreographed by translational regulation, accompanies the switch from TA cell proliferation to terminal differentiation in the Drosophila male GSC lineage. Loss of mei-P26 function in males led to overproliferation of spermatogonial TA cysts. Whereas the apical third of wild-type testes contains many large spermatocytes easily visible by phase-contrast microscopy (Figure 1B, arrows), testes from flies hemizygous for the null allele mei-P26mfs1 (Page et al., 2000Page S.L. McKim K.S. Deneen B. Van Hook T.L. Hawley R.S. Genetic studies of mei-P26 reveal a link between the processes that control germ cell proliferation in both sexes and those that control meiotic exchange in Drosophila.Genetics. 2000; 155: 1757-1772PubMed Google Scholar) showed cysts full of many small cells (Figure 1C), resembling testes from bam mutant males (Gönczy et al., 1997Gönczy P. Matunis E. DiNardo S. bag-of-marbles and benign gonial cell neoplasm act in the germline to restrict proliferation during Drosophila spermatogenesis.Development. 1997; 124: 4361-4371PubMed Google Scholar; McKearin and Spradling, 1990McKearin D.M. Spradling A.C. bag-of-marbles: a Drosophila gene required to initiate both male and female gametogenesis.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2242-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The clusters of small cells were Vasa positive, indicating germ cell identity, and had small nuclei (Figure 1E), similar to early germ cells at the apical tip of wild-type testes (Figure 1D). A short pulse of the nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed that early germ cells in mei-P26 mutant testes underwent several extra rounds of mitotic division and behaved as TA cells rather than as stem cells, with all cells within a cyst going through S phase synchronously (Figure 1G, arrow). Whereas wild-type testes briefly pulsed with EdU showed cysts in S phase with 2, 4, 8, or 16 cells, but none with >16 cells (Figure 1F, arrow) (n = 7 testes: 14 S phase cysts with 8 or 16 cells, and zero with >16 cells), mei-P26 mutant testes had many cysts with more than 16 cells undergoing S phase (Figure 1G, arrow) (n = 9 testes: 21 S phase cysts with 8 or 16 cells, and 52 with >16 cells). Overproliferating spermatogonial cysts in mei-P26 mutants eventually died, as indicated by the refractile appearance in phase-contrast images (Figure 1C, arrowheads) and by TUNEL staining (Figure S1B available online), similar to the eventual death of overproliferating germ cell cysts in bam mutant testes (Insco et al., 2009Insco M.L. Leon A. Tam C.H. McKearin D.M. Fuller M.T. Accumulation of a differentiation regulator specifies transit amplifying division number in an adult stem cell lineage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Spradling A.C. bag-of-marbles: a Drosophila gene required to initiate both male and female gametogenesis.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2242-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Early germ cells in mei-P26 mutant testes had enlarged nucleoli compared to their wild-type counterparts (Figures 1H–1J). Similar increases in nucleolar size were observed in mei-P26 mutant female germ cells (Neumüller et al., 2008Neumüller R.A. Betschinger J. Fischer A. Bushati N. Poernbacher I. Mechtler K. Cohen S.M. Knoblich J.A. Mei-P26 regulates microRNAs and cell growth in the Drosophila ovarian stem cell lineage.Nature. 2008; 454: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and in C. elegans cells mutant for the worm mei-P26 homolog ncl-1 (Hedgecock and Herman, 1995Hedgecock E.M. Herman R.K. The ncl-1 gene and genetic mosaics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1995; 141: 989-1006PubMed Google Scholar). The enlarged nucleoli observed in mei-P26 mutant male germ cells (Figures 1I and 1J) may correlate with accumulation of abnormally high levels of dMyc (Grewal et al., 2005Grewal S.S. Li L. Orian A. Eisenman R.N. Edgar B.A. Myc-dependent regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis during Drosophila development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In wild-type testes, dMyc levels were relatively low in GSCs and early TA cells and then increased in 8- and early 16-cell cysts (Figures S1C and S1E). However, dMyc protein levels were uniformly high in GSCs and early TA cells in mei-P26 mutant testes (Figures S1D and S1E). Mei-P26 function was not absolutely required for male germ cells to become spermatocytes, but rather appeared to make the switch to differentiation accurate and timely. Some germ cell cysts in mei-P26 mutant testes did switch to the spermatocyte state, exhibiting the characteristic growth in cell size and expression of the spermatocyte marker Sa (Figure 2B versus 2A). In wild-type testes, 95% of spermatocyte cysts located in the apical third of the testis contained 16 spermatocytes per cyst (Figure 2C, black bars, and 2D). However, in a comparable region of mei-P26 mutant testes, 68% of cysts had many small germ cells, consistent with overproliferating TA cells (20% >64 small cells [Figure 2E]; 48% refractile dying cysts), and 32% of cysts progressed to the spermatocyte state (Figure 2C, gray bars). Of the 32% of cysts that did progress to the spermatocyte state, only a third (10% of total cysts) had the correct 16 spermatocytes per cyst. Another third (9% of total cysts) had >16 spermatocytes per cyst, indicating that too many TA divisions occurred prior to the switch. Mei-P26 function was also required for proper differentiation of spermatocytes. Many cysts (13% of total cysts) had differentiating cells with grossly abnormal morphology, including elongating spermatids with 16 large nuclei instead of 64 small nuclei, consistent with progression to spermatid differentiation without meiotic division (Figure 2F). The mei-P26 mutant overproliferation and differentiation defects were rescued by a chromosomal duplication or a genomic transgene containing mei-P26 (Experimental Procedures). The inability of many mei-P26 mutant germ cell cysts to properly exit the TA divisions appears to be due to the failure to accumulate Bam protein to levels required for triggering the switch from proliferation to differentiation. The level of Bam protein detected by immunofluorescence staining was lower in 4-, 8-, and 16-cell TA cysts from mei-P26 mutant testes compared to wild-type testes stained on the same slides (Figures 3A–3C). In addition, Bam protein expression perdured at low levels in late overproliferating cysts in the mei-P26 mutant (Figures 3B and 3C). Strikingly, increasing the gene dosage of Bam by introducing a genomic transgene rescued the TA cell overproliferation defects observed in mei-P26 mutant testes, indicating that overproliferation of TA cells in mei-P26 mutant males is due to the failure to accumulate normal levels of Bam protein. Whereas testes from mei-P26mfs1 sibling controls showed overproliferation of early germ cell cysts (Figures 3D and 3G, light gray bars), introducing a single copy of a genomic transgene expressing either wild-type Bam (alpha-Bam, Figures 3E and 3G, dark gray bars) or Bam protein lacking the C-terminal PEST degradation sequence (Figures 3F and 3G, black bars) into the mei-P26 mutant background eliminated TA cell overproliferation. Testes from mei-P26mfs1;alpha-Bam/+ males had no cysts full of small cells or refractile cysts in the corresponding region (Figure 3E). Rather, 72% of the cysts in the spermatocyte region had 16 spermatocytes per cyst, and <1% had 8 spermatocytes per cyst (Figure 3G, dark gray bars). Likewise, in mei-P26mfs1;BamΔPEST/+ testes, none of the cysts in the spermatocyte region had overproliferating small cells (Figure 3F), 43% had 16 spermatocytes per cyst, and 37% had 8 spermatocytes per cyst (Figure 3G, black bars), similar to BamΔPEST alone (Insco et al., 2009Insco M.L. Leon A. Tam C.H. McKearin D.M. Fuller M.T. Accumulation of a differentiation regulator specifies transit amplifying division number in an adult stem cell lineage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 22311-22316Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similar suppression of the mei-P26 mutant overproliferation phenotype was observed after forced expression of Bam under the control of the heat shock promoter (Figure S2A). In addition to rescuing TA cell overproliferation, introducing an extra copy of bam also normalized the enlarged nucleoli observed in mei-P26 mutant testes. Whereas mei-P26 mutant germ cells in 16-cell cysts had enlarged nucleoli, both mei-P26mfs1;alpha-Bam/+ and mei-P26mfs1;BamΔPEST/+ germ cells had smaller nucleoli that were similar in size to wild-type nucleoli (Figure S2B). Introducing an extra copy of bam did not, however, rescue the meiotic and spermatid differentiation defects characteristic of mei-P26 mutant males. In mei-P26mfs1;BamΔPEST/+ testes, 30% of cysts from the spermatocyte region had differentiation defects, including abnormal mitochondrial derivatives and cysts of elongating spermatids with 16 large nuclei, indicating spermatid differentiation without meiosis (Figure 3I). Likewise, 27% of cysts from mei-P26mfs1;alpha-Bam/+ males showed spermatocyte or spermatid differentiation defects (Figure 3G, dark gray bars), indicating a late requirement for Mei-P26 function independent of Bam. Taken together, the results suggest that Mei-P26 first functions in early TA germ cells to facilitate timely accumulation of Bam protein. Mei-P26 also acts later, after the switch to spermatocyte state, facilitating the normal progression of meiotic divisions and spermatid differentiation. Mei-P26 protein levels detected by immunofluorescence changed dynamically in TA cells, starting high in early TA cells, consistent with a role in Bam accumulation, and dropping to background levels as Bam protein expression peaked (Figures 4A–4A″ and 4 C). Mei-P26 protein levels rose again in spermatocytes, consistent with the later requirement of Mei-P26 for meiosis and differentiation. Analysis of Mei-P26 and Bam protein in testes pulsed briefly with EdU revealed that Mei-P26 expression was at high levels in GSCs and early TA cells, gradually decreased in level in 4- through 8-cell cysts, and was below the level of detection by our immunofluorescence methods in 16-cell cysts in S phase. Mei-P26 reappeared in early spermatocytes after Bam disappeared (Figures 4B–4C). Mei-P26 protein appeared to concentrate in puncta in the cytoplasm, especially in early germ cells (Figure 4D, arrows). Many of the Mei-P26 puncta in early germ cells colocalized with the miRNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) component GW182 (Figures 4E–4G). Drosophila GW182 interacts with argonaute-1 (Ago-1) (Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006Behm-Ansmant I. Rehwinkel J. Doerks T. Stark A. Bork P. Izaurralde E. mRNA degradation by miRNAs and GW182 requires both CCR4:NOT deadenylase and DCP1:DCP2 decapping complexes.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1885-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), and both GW182 and Ago-1 have recently been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with Mei-P26 in the Drosophila ovary (Li et al., 2012Li Y. Maines J.Z. Tastan O.Y. McKearin D.M. Buszczak M. Mei-P26 regulates the maintenance of ovarian germline stem cells by promoting BMP signaling.Development. 2012; 139: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The drop in Mei-P26 protein expression in late TA cells was dependent on the function of Bam and Bgcn. In wild-type testes, Mei-P26 protein levels decreased in 8-cell cysts (Figure 4H, white outlines), and Mei-P26 was not detected in later 8-cell (Figure 4H′, arrow) or early 16-cell cysts (Figure 4B′, white outline). However, in bam or bgcn mutant testes, Mei-P26 protein levels remained high throughout the region of overproliferating early germ cells, including in 8-cell (Figures 4I, upper outline, and 4J, left outline) and 16-cell cysts in S phase (Figures 4I, lower outline, and 4J, right outline). Downregulation of Mei-P26 expression in late TA and early 16-cell cysts may be important for correct timing of the switch from spermatogonial proliferation to differentiation in the male germline. Early forced re-expression of Mei-P26 protein in late TA cells using the bamGal4 driver and a UAS-mei-P26 construct with a SV40 termination signal in place of the mei-P26 3′ UTR was sufficient for driving 23% of spermatocyte cysts to differentiate early, with fewer than 16 cells (Figure S3C). In contrast, <1% of spermatocyte cysts in wild-type testes had fewer than 16 cells per cyst. The decrease in Mei-P26 protein expression in late TA cells and early 16-cell cysts raised the possibility that mei-P26 might be translationally repressed. Although Mei-P26 protein levels dropped, in situ hybridization showed no break in mei-P26 mRNA expression in late TA or early 16-cell cysts (Figure S4A). Consistent with translational control, the 3′ UTR of mei-P26 was sufficient to reduce expression of an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) reporter in TA cells until Bam was downregulated in vivo (Figures 5B–5B″ , white outline). Reporters were transcribed specifically in TA cells with the use of bamGal4 for driving upstream activating sequence (UAS) constructs. A control reporter expressing eYFP with the SV40 termination sequence revealed eYFP expression in 79% of Bam-positive cysts (Figures 5A–5A″, 5C, and 5D, reporter 1). The control reporter was routinely first detected in cysts after Bam expression was initiated, presumably due to the time delay caused by the bipartite Gal4/UAS system. Consistent with this, the 20% of Bam-positive cysts that lacked eYFP with the control reporter were commonly the most apical (youngest) cysts (Figures 5A–5A″). To generate a reporter containing mei-P26 sequences, the mei-P26 3′ UTR expressed in wild-type testes was determined by 3′ rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends and then inserted between eYFP and the SV40 termination sequence. The mei-P26 3′ UTR expressed in the testes was shorter than the form expressed in embryos (549 versus 640 nt), terminating before the site bound and regulated by Vasa in female germ cells (Liu et al., 2009Liu N. Han H. Lasko P. Vasa promotes Drosophila germline stem cell differentiation by activating mei-P26 translation by directly interacting with a (U)-rich motif in its 3′ UTR.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2742-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Figure S5A). When transcription of the eYFP reporter containing the full-length mei-P26 3′ UTR was driven by bamGal4, the reporter was expressed in only 28% of Bam-positive cysts (Figures 5B–5D, reporter 2), in contrast to the 79% observed with the control reporter (Figures 5A–5A″, 5C, and 5D, reporter 1). Analysis of smaller regions of the mei-P26 3′ UTR in reporter constructs in vivo mapped the sequence sufficient for translational repression to 247 nucleotides (94–341) of the mei-P26 3′ UTR (Figures 5C and 5D, reporters 3, 5, and 6). Further deletion from the 3′ end of the 3′ UTR appeared to abolish translational repression in vivo, as reporter constructs carrying nucleotides 94 to 292 or 94 to 245 showed detectable eYFP expression in 60% of Bam-positive cysts (Figures 5C and 5D, reporters 10 and 11). Nucleotide substitutions in a predicted Pumilio binding site (482–489 nt) failed to disrupt repression in TA cells (Figures 5C and 5D, reporter 4). Known homologs of mei-P26, such as C.elegans lin-41 and Drosophila dappled, are translationally repressed via their 3′ UTR by the miRNA let-7 (O’Farrell et al., 2008O’Farrell F. Esfahani S.S.

Given this and recent reports of atypical miRNA target sites found through biochemical methods (Chi et al., 2012Chi S.W. Hannon G.J. Darnell R.B.

Cell. 2007; 27: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3033) Google Scholar), we searched by eye for possible let-7 seed sequences and found two sites within the region of the mei-P26 3′ UTR sufficient for translational repression (185–190 nt and 285–292 nt). RNAhybrid verified that the putative target sites were the areas most likely to exhibit let-7 binding in the entire mei-P26 3′ UTR (Figures 5E, S5C, and S5D) (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004Rehmsmeier M. Steffen P. Hochsmann M. Giegerich R. Fast and effective prediction of microRNA/target duplexes.RNA. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of one of the predicted let-7 target sites contributed to a PhastCons conserved element (Figure S5B, asterisk 2). Strikingly, introducing nucleotide substitutions (from CTCC to AGAA) in either seed sequence into the reporter carrying the mei-P26 3′ UTR disrupted repression, restoring eYFP expression to 79% of the Bam-positive cysts (Figures 5C and 5D, reporters 7–9). Consistent with the possibility that let-7 might contribute to translational repression of endogenous Mei-P26 in early male germ cells in vivo, varying the level of let-7 expression led to changes in Mei-P26 protein expression. In let-7-C homozygous mutant testes, the level of Mei-P26 protein detected by immunofluorescence was higher in GSCs and in 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-cell cysts compared to wild-type testes (Figures 5F–5H). Forced expression of let-7-C in early germ cells using nanosGal4 to drive UAS-let-7-C led to decreased levels of Mei-P26 protein expression at all cell stages compared to wild-type testes (Figures S5E–S5G). The action of Bam and Bgcn was required for repression of the mei-P26 3′ UTR reporter in TA cells in vivo. We compared the onset of"

Here we report on a recently discovered γD-crystallin mutant (W42R) that has been linked to autosomal dominant, congenital cataracts in a Chinese family. The mutant protein is much less soluble and stable than wild-type γD-crystallin. We solved the crystal structure of W42R at 1.7 Å resolution, which revealed only minor differences from the wild-type structure. Interestingly, the W42R variant is highly susceptible to protease digestion, suggesting the presence of a small population of partially unfolded protein. This partially unfolded species was confirmed and quantified by NMR spectroscopy. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments revealed chemical exchange between the folded and unfolded species. Exposure of wild-type γD-crystallin to UV caused damage to the N-terminal domain of the protein, resulting in very similar proteolytic susceptibility as observed for the W42R mutant. Altogether, our combined data allowed us to propose a model for W42R pathogenesis, with the W42R mutant serving as a mimic for photodamaged γD-crystallin involved in age-related cataract.

We solved the crystal structure of W42R at 1.7 Å resolution, which revealed only minor differences from the wild-type structure. Interestingly, the W42R variant is highly susceptible to protease digestion, suggesting the presence of a small population of partially unfolded protein. This partially unfolded species was confirmed and quantified by NMR spectroscopy. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments revealed chemical exchange between the folded and unfolded species. Exposure of wild-type γD-crystallin to UV caused damage to the N-terminal domain of the protein, resulting in very similar proteolytic susceptibility as observed for the W42R mutant. Altogether, our combined data allowed us to propose a model for W42R pathogenesis, with the W42R mutant serving as a mimic for photodamaged γD-crystallin involved in age-related cataract. Cataract, referred to as opacification of all or part of the crystalline lens of the eye (1Reddy M.A. Bateman O.A. Chakarova C. Ferris J. Berry V. Lomas E. Sarra R. Smith M.A. Moore A.T.

The congenital cataracts occur at an estimated prevalence of 2.2–2.5 cases per 10,000 live births (3Rahi J.S. Dezateux C.

Cataract-associated mutations in the crystallin genes are known to occur in all three crystallin families (5Hejtmancik J.F. Congenital cataracts and their molecular genetics.Semin. Cell Dev.

At the present time, at least 60 cases of inherited cataracts have been documented; these appear to be caused by a single-gene disorder, and amino acid substitutions have been mapped to the affected genes (7Shiels A.

These mutants, including F56A, I81A, V132A, and L145A, possess a destabilized N-td that results in a non-negligible population of partially folded species.

R2 relaxation dispersion experiments on the murine γS-F9S mutant showed an ∼2% population of a loosely structured intermediate at 37 °C that increased with temperature (20Mahler B. Doddapaneni K.

Human eyes are directly exposed to ambient sunlight, including potentially damaging UV. In native crystallins, which constitute the major eye lens proteins, it is assumed that extensive tryptophan fluorescence quenching influences the lens response to ultraviolet light and protects the retina from ambient ultraviolet damage (21Chen J. Callis P.R. King J. Mechanism of the very efficient quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in human γD- and γS-crystallins: the γ-crystallin fold may have evolved to protect tryptophan residues from ultraviolet photodamage.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3708-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Chen J.

Mechanism of the efficient tryptophan fluorescence quenching in human γD-crystallin studied by time-resolved fluorescence.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10705-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, oxidized tryptophan has been identified in HGD in the mature-onset cataractous human lens by mass spectrometry (24Searle B.C. Dasari S. Wilmarth P.A. Turner M. Reddy A.P. David L.L. Nagalla S.R. Identification of protein modifications using MS/MS de novo sequencing and the OpenSea alignment algorithm.J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and tryptophan photodamage in the crystallins may be one of the factors in the etiology of cataract formation (25Robman L. Taylor H. External factors in the development of cataract.Eye. 2005; 19: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel mutation in HGD was discovered in a Chinese family, with the affected individuals exhibiting nuclear congenital cataracts (26Wang B. Yu C. Xi Y.B. Cai H.C. Wang J. Zhou S. Zhou S. Wu Y. Yan Y.B. Ma X. Xie L. A novel CRYGD mutation (p.Trp43Arg) causing autosomal dominant congenital cataract in a Chinese family.Hum. Mutat. 2011; 32: E1939-E1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A single T/C change at position 127 in the CRYGD gene was mapped, translating into a tryptophan to arginine change at position 42 (W42R) in the amino acid sequence of the mature protein, i.e. the loss of one of the four conserved tryptophans from the protein. The W42R mutant protein was reported to be less stable and more prone to aggregate when subjected to environmental stresses, such as heat and UV irradiation, when compared with HGD (26Wang B. Yu C. Xi Y.B. Cai H.C. Wang J. Zhou S. Zhou S. Wu Y. Yan Y.B. Ma X. Xie L. A novel CRYGD mutation (p.Trp43Arg) causing autosomal dominant congenital cataract in a Chinese family.Hum. Mutat. 2011; 32: E1939-E1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, no structural or other biochemical characterizations were carried out to elucidate how this mutation could lead to cataract formation. To address whether the loss of the tryptophan residue in the mutant alters the protein such as to make it more susceptible to aggregation and precipitation, we investigated W42R γD-crystallin by NMR spectroscopy and determined its high resolution x-ray structure. In addition, the thermodynamic behavior was probed by guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding, and a comparative proteolysis study was performed for W42R and HGD. We show that W42R exhibits the HGD fold with no major, discernable conformational differences between mutant and wild type, although the relative domain orientation in the two x-ray structures is slightly different. Interestingly, however, a small, but noteworthy fraction of partially unfolded protein was detected for the W42R mutant in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Based on our overall results, we conclude that the W42R mutation introduces partial unfolding in the N-td, mimicking the effect of photodamage caused by UV exposure of HGD. This partially folded species may act as the seed for aggregation and precipitation of the mutant protein, nucleating cataract formation. Cloning, expression, and purification of the W42R mutant was essentially similar to that previously reported for wild-type HGD and the R76S mutant (27Jung J. Byeon I.J. Wang Y. King J. Gronenborn A.M. The structure of the cataract-causing P23T mutant of human γD-crystallin exhibits distinctive local conformational and dynamic changes.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2597-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Ji F.

Structural and biochemical characterization of the childhood cataract-associated R76S mutant of human γD-crystallin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli cells that harbored pET-14b with the mutant γD-crystallin gene were grown at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and further grown at 16 °C for 16 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1% (v/v) 100× HaltTM protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by passage through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Q XL anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The flow-through fraction was collected and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.2) in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 2% glycerol. The dialyzed sample was loaded on a HiTrap SP cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m over a 20-column volume. Fractions containing the protein were collected, concentrated, and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT as the final purification step. All purified proteins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE PRO instrument, operated in a linear mode with external calibration. HGD and W42R exhibited experimental molecular masses of 20,592.10 and 20,558.05 Da, respectively (the theoretical molecular masses are 20,606.94 and 20,576.91 Da, respectively). Protein concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), using extinction coefficients of 42.86 and 37.36 mm−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for HGD and W42R, respectively. Small and low quality crystals of W42R were initially grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 0.17 m Li2SO4, 0.085 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 25.5% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. Subsequent optimization was performed by adding 1% (w/v) of octyl β-d-glucopyranoside to the protein solution (8, 12, and 16 mg/ml) and by varying both Li2SO4 (0.14, 0.18, 0.22, and 0.26 m) and PEG 4000 (18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28%) concentrations. The ratio of protein to mother liquor was kept constant at 2:2 μl. The final diffraction data were collected from a crystal grown in 0.18 m Li2SO4, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 22% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 15% (v/v) glycerol at a protein concentration of 16 mg/ml. X-ray diffraction data were collected up to 1.6 Å on flash-cooled crystals (−180 °C) using a Rigaku FR-E generator with Saturn 944 charge-coupled device detectors at the wavelength corresponding to the copper edge (1.54 Å). Initial indexing of the diffraction patterns indicated that W42R crystallized in the P3221 space group with unit cell dimensions: a = 68.61 Å, b = 68.61 Å, and c = 133.38 Å (α = β = 90° and γ = 120°). Two molecules are present per asymmetric unit with an estimated solvent content of ∼44.11% (Vm = 2.2 Å3/Da) based on the Matthews Probability Calculator (29Kantardjieff K.A. Rupp B. Matthews coefficient probabilities: Improved estimates for unit cell contents of proteins, DNA, and protein-nucleic acid complex crystals.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1865-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). All diffraction data were processed, integrated, and scaled using the d*TREK software (30Pflugrath J.W. The finer things in X-ray diffraction data collection.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) and eventually converted to MTZ format using the CCP4 package (31Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar). The structure for W42R was solved by molecular replacement using wild-type HGD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 1HK0) as the search model in PHASER (32McCoy A.J. Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). After generation of the initial model, the chain was rebuilt using Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar) followed by iterative refinement that involved alternating between manual rebuilding and automated refinement in REFMAC (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13865) Google Scholar). Due to relatively incomplete reflections and intensity decay (high Rmerge) at the highest resolution range (1.7–1.6 Å), the final W42R structure was refined to 1.70 Å, with a final R-factor value of 20.0% and a free R value of 24.5%. 97.7 and 100% of all residues are located in the favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively, and no residues were found in the disallowed region, as judged by MOLPROBITY (35Davis I.W.

Spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technology Inc., Santa Clara, CA), equipped with a circulating water bath. Samples were prepared at 10 μg/ml protein concentration in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA in the absence or presence of increasing GdnHCl concentrations (0–5.5 m). Prior to the measurements, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to ensure that equilibrium had been reached. Spectra were corrected for background fluorescence from GdnHCl, and the unfolding curve was obtained by plotting the 360:320 nm fluorescence intensity ratio versus the concentration of GdnHCl. Equivalent data were collected for the urea unfolding experiments, conducted over the concentration range of 0–3 m urea. HGD and W42R proteins (20 μg) were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence and absence of sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100, in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm DTT, 0.02% NaN3. Solutions of unlabeled wild-type protein (1 mg/ml) in a 3-ml quartz cuvette were exposed to UV light of 254 nm at different total energy doses (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 J/cm2) using a SpectrolinkerTM UV source (Spectronics Corp.). Following irradiation, a small aliquot of each sample was saved, whereas the remainder was digested with trypsin as described above. Electrophoretic analysis was carried out for all irradiated samples, both with and without trypsin digestion. Similarly, a solution of 15N-labeled HGD (2 mg/ml) in an NMR tube was also exposed to UV light of 254 nm at an energy dose of 1.0 J/cm2. Like unlabeled HGD, a small aliquot was saved, and another aliquot was digested with trypsin. Both samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. For the remainder of the sample, a two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was recorded and compared with that of nonirradiated 15N-labeled HGD. NMR spectra for resonance assignments were acquired at 25 °C, using both 15N-labeled and 13C,15N-labeled samples on Bruker AVANCE 900, AVANCE 800, or AVANCE 600 spectrometers, equipped with 5-mm triple-resonance z-axis gradient cryoprobes. Temperature calibration was performed using the chemical shift differences between methyl and hydroxyl protons of 100% methanol. All samples contained 0.1 mm protein in NMR buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) D2O). HNCA and HNCACB experiments were recorded and used for backbone resonance assignments. The combined amide proton and nitrogen chemical shift differences between mutant and HGD were calculated using Δδ = √((0.15 × ΔδN)2+(ΔδH)2). For hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange experiments, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 25 °C over a total time interval of 30 h on 15N-labeled 0.1 mm protein samples in NMR buffer in 50% (v/v) D2O at 600 MHz. Time points of 0, 6, 11, 22, and 30 h were chosen for analysis. Temperature-dependent 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 25, 37, and 42 °C at 900 MHz. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar) and analyzed using CARA (38Keller B. Christen M. Oostenbrink C. van Gunsteren W.F. On using oscillating time-dependent restraints in MD simulation.J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 37: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or SPARKY3 (version 3.113) (39Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. 3.110 Ed. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). Native recombinant W42R mutant protein without a His-tag was prepared because we previously observed that the presence of a His-tag significantly increased the solubility of the P23T γD-crystallin (27Jung J. Byeon I.J. Wang Y. King J. Gronenborn A.M. The structure of the cataract-causing P23T mutant of human γD-crystallin exhibits distinctive local conformational and dynamic changes.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2597-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess the solubility and stability of the W42R mutant, we incubated the native mutant protein solution, concentrated at 10 mg/ml, and the wild-type protein as a control, at 37 °C overnight. After removal of protein precipitation by centrifugation, observed solely in the mutant sample, the final protein concentration in the supernatant was found to be 2.3 mg/ml. This is different from our findings for the wild-type protein, for which the solution stays clear and at the same protein concentration as initially measured. Indeed, the wild-type protein can be concentrated to ∼350 mg/ml, whereas the mutant protein readily precipitates when the protein concentration reaches ∼20 mg/ml. Our finding is therefore different from a previous report that found no noticeable difference between HGD and W42R solubility (26Wang B. Yu C. Xi Y.B. Cai H.C. Wang J. Zhou S. Zhou S. Wu Y. Yan Y.B. Ma X. Xie L. A novel CRYGD mutation (p.Trp43Arg) causing autosomal dominant congenital cataract in a Chinese family.Hum. Mutat. 2011; 32: E1939-E1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Note that both protein constructs that were used in the previous study contained His tags and that the analysis was carried out at low protein concentration (5 mg/ml) at a single temperature (26Wang B. Yu C. Xi Y.B. Cai H.C. Wang J. Zhou S. Zhou S. Wu Y. Yan Y.B. Ma X. Xie L. A novel CRYGD mutation (p.Trp43Arg) causing autosomal dominant congenital cataract in a Chinese family.Hum. Mutat. 2011; 32: E1939-E1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To assess the W42R mutant structure, we recorded 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the mutant and the wild-type protein under identical buffer conditions. Because backbone 1H-15N amide group resonances are very sensitive to conformation and electronic environment, 1H-15N HSQC spectra can be used as a fingerprint of the conformation of a protein. In the W42R mutant spectrum, 166 of 168 possible amide resonances were assigned. As evidenced by the superposition of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of W42R and HGD shown in Fig. 1A, the mutant exhibits equally well dispersed resonances of uniform line widths as the wild-type protein, with most resonances overlapping or shifted only by a small amount. This suggests that the structure of the mutant is very similar to that of HGD. A quantitative comparison of the backbone chemical shifts between W42R and HGD reveals that all effects of the mutation are confined to the N-td, and perturbed resonances belong to amino acids close in either sequence or structure to the site of mutation (Fig. 1B). The largest combined amide 1H-15N chemical shift differences are associated with Ile-3, Ser-39, Cys-41, and Ile-81, with a maximum value of ∼1.25 ppm. As expected, removal of the tryptophan side chain is expected to affect amide resonances of residues located above or below the large aromatic ring because ring current shifts will no longer be present in the mutant. Indeed, such changes are observed for Arg-2–Lys-5, Val-75, Cys-78–Ile-81, and Ser-84. At first sight, it seemed surprising that the replacement of the large hydrophobic side chain (Trp) by a long, positively charged side chain (Arg) did not cause a significant structural change. Given that in the HGD structure the Trp residue is positioned in the hydrophobic core of the N-td, one would have assumed that the positive charged Arg side chain would perturb the structure considerably. However, this appeared not to be the case. Conformation of our NMR findings was obtained by crystallography. Superposition of the N-td (residues 1–81) and C-td (residues 89–171) domains of the W42R mutant (Fig. 2A, colored red and magenta, respectively) onto those of HGD (Fig. 2A, colored cyan) yielded average pairwise r.m.s.d. values of 0.363 and 0.280 Å, respectively, for the backbone atoms. These low r.m.s.d. values confirm that the domain structures of the W42R mutant and HGD are extremely similar (Fig. 2A). Note that the two molecules of W42R in the asymmetric unit exhibit an average pairwise backbone atom r.m.s.d. value of 0.205 Å. Quite surprisingly, superposition of the overall W42R mutant and HGD structures (residues 1–171) yielded a somewhat larger, average backbone r.m.s.d. value of 0.795 Å. Indeed, the relative orientation between the N-td and C-td in the W42R mutant and HGD is slightly different with a tilt angle of 9.1° between the domains (Fig. 2B). This either could be caused by the Trp-Arg substitution or may simply be the result of crystal packing. Further detailed analysis of the W42R and the HGD structures revea"

We posit that a trace of a recent nociceptive event can be used to create sensory-re-experiencing of pain that can be qualified in terms of intensity and vividness. Fifteen healthy volunteers received three levels of thermal stimuli (warm, low pain and high pain) and subsequently were asked to recall and then rate this experience. Neuroimaging results reveal that recalling a previous sensory experience activates an extensive network of classical pain processing structures except the contralateral posterior insular cortex. Nociceptive-specific activation of this structure and the rated intensity difference between physical and recalled pain events allow us to investigate the link between the quality of the original nociceptive stimulus and the mental trace, as well as the differences between the accompanying neural responses. Additionally, by incorporating the behavioural ratings, we explored which brain regions were separately responsible for generating either an accurate or vivid recall of the physical experience. Together, these observations further our understanding of centrally-mediated pain experiences and pain memory as well as the potential relevance of these factors in the maintenance of chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2146678198,"During B cell differentiation in the bone marrow, the expression and activation of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) constitute crucial checkpoints for B cell development. Both constitutive and ligand-dependent pre-BCR activation modes have been described. The pre-BCR constitutes an immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igμ) and a surrogate light chain composed of the invariant λ5 and VpreB proteins. We previously showed that galectin-1 (GAL1), produced by bone marrow stromal cells, is a pre-BCR ligand that induces receptor clustering, leading to efficient pre-BII cell proliferation and differentiation. GAL1 interacts with the pre-BCR via the unique region of λ5 (λ5-UR). Here, we investigated the solution structure of a minimal λ5-UR motif that interacts with GAL1. This motif adopts a stable helical conformation that docks onto a GAL1 hydrophobic surface adjacent to its carbohydrate binding site. We identified key hydrophobic residues from the λ5-UR as crucial for the interaction with GAL1 and for pre-BCR clustering. These residues involved in GAL1-induced pre-BCR activation are different from those essential for autonomous receptor activation. Overall, our results indicate that constitutive and ligand-induced pre-BCR activation could occur in a complementary manner."

In yeast, the majority of PE is produced from phosphatidylserine (PS) by a mitochondrion-located PS decarboxylase, Psd1p. Because PS is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PS is transported from the ER to mitochondria and converted to PE. After its synthesis, a portion of PE moves back to the ER. Two mitochondrial proteins located in the intermembrane space, Ups1p and Ups2p, have been shown to regulate PE metabolism by controlling the export of PE. It remains to be determined where PS is decarboxylated in mitochondria and whether decarboxylation is coupled to trafficking of PS. Here, using fluorescent PS as a substrate in an in vitro assay for Psd1p-dependent PE production in isolated mitochondria, we show that PS is transferred from the mitochondrial outer membrane to the inner membrane independently of Psd1p, Ups1p, and Ups2p and decarboxylated to PE by Psd1p in the inner membrane. Interestingly, Ups1p is required for the maintenance of Psd1p and therefore PE production. Restoration of Psd1p levels rescued PE production defects in ups1Δ mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W2143973426,"Notch signaling constitutes an evolutionarily conserved pathway that transduces signals between neighboring cells and determines major decisions in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Notch signaling has been shown to play a pivotal role during T cell lineage determination. T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) display a severely altered phenotype with several molecular and functional aberrations, including defective capacities to up-regulate Notch-1 receptor expression upon T cell receptor activation. Here, we demonstrate that basal Notch-1 expression is decreased in T cells from active SLE patients at the mRNA and protein levels in various T cell subpopulations. Notch-1 transcript numbers inversely correlate with disease activity in SLE patients. We provide evidence that both enhanced histone H3 methylation and CpG DNA methylation of the human Notch-1 promoter contribute to decreased Notch-1 expression in SLE T cells. Previous data from our group identified cAMP-responsive element modulator α (CREMα), which is up-regulated in SLE T cells, as a key regulator of epigenetic patterns and gene transcription, e.g. that of IL2 and IL17 genes. In this study, we observed increased CREMα binding to the Notch-1 promoter, which eventually resulted in significantly reduced Notch-1 promoter activity and gene transcription. Notably, decreased Notch-1 levels were associated with elevated IL-17A levels. Our data suggest a role for Notch-1 in SLE immunopathogenesis, and for the first time, we present molecular mechanisms that mediate dysregulated Notch-1 expression in SLE T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1989016558,"A recent large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide studies has identified 95 loci, 59 of them novel, as statistically significant predictors of blood lipid traits; we tested whether the same loci explain the observed heterogeneity in response to lipid-lowering therapy with fenofibrate. Using data from the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN, n = 861) we fit linear mixed models with the genetic markers as predictors and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations as outcomes. For all four traits, we analyzed both baseline levels and changes in response to treatment with fenofibrate. For the markers that were significantly associated with fenofibrate response, we fit additional models evaluating potential epistatic interactions. All models were adjusted for age, sex, and study center as fixed effects, and pedigree as a random effect. Statistically significant associations were observed between the rs964184 polymorphism near APOA1 (P-value≤0.0001) and fenofibrate response for HDL and triglycerides. The association was replicated in the Pharmacogenetics of Hypertriglyceridemia in Hispanics study (HyperTG, n = 267). Suggestive associations with fenofibrate response were observed for markers in or near PDE3A, MOSC1, FLJ36070, CETP, the APOE-APOC1-APOC4-APOC2, and CILP2. Finally, we present strong evidence for epistasis (P-value for interaction = 0.0006 in GOLDN, 0.05 in HyperTG) between rs10401969 near CILP2 and rs4420638 in the APOE-APOC1-APOC4-APOC2 cluster with total cholesterol response to fenofibrate. In conclusion, we present evidence linking several novel and biologically relevant genetic polymorphisms to lipid lowering drug response, as well as suggesting novel gene-gene interactions in fenofibrate pharmacogenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2150530260,"In species with discrete morphs exhibiting alternative behavioral strategies, individuals may vary their aggressive behavior in competitive encounters according to the phenotype of their opponent. Such aggression bias has been documented in multiple polymorphic species evolving under negative frequency-dependent selection, but it has not been well-studied under other selection regimes. We investigated this phenomenon in white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), a passerine with plumage polychromatism maintained by disassortative mating. The two distinct color morphs differ with respect to reproductive strategy in that white-striped birds invest more in territorial aggression than tan-striped birds. Whether territorial aggression in this species is biased according to the morph of an intruder is less understood. We found that during peak territorial and mating activity, both color morphs and sexes can exhibit aggression bias, but whether they do so depends on the strategy (morph) of the intruder. During simulated territorial intrusions, resident white-striped males and tan-striped females, which represent the opposite ends of a continuum from high to low territorial aggression, altered their territorial responses according to intruder morph. Tan-striped males and white-striped females, which represent the middle of the continuum, did not show a bias. We propose that because of the disassortative mating system and morph differences in reproductive strategy, the fitness risks of intrusions vary according to the morphs of the resident and the intruder, and that aggression bias is an attuned response to varying threats to fitness."

Since the first derivation of hESCs in 1998, a variety of culture conditions have been described for the undifferentiated growth of hPSCs. In this study, we cultured both hESCs and hiPSCs in three different culture conditions: on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and SNL feeder cell layers together with conventional stem cell culture medium containing knockout serum replacement and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), as well as on a Matrigel matrix in mTeSR1 medium. hPSC lines were subjected to cardiac differentiation in mouse visceral endodermal-like (END-2) co-cultures and the cardiac differentiation efficiency was determined by counting both the beating areas and Troponin T positive cells, as well as studying the expression of OCT-3/4, mesodermal Brachyury T and NKX2.5 and endodermal SOX-17 at various time points during END-2 differentiation by q-RT-PCR analysis. The most efficient cardiac differentiation was observed with hPSCs cultured on MEF or SNL feeder cell layers in stem cell culture medium and the least efficient cardiac differentiation was observed on a Matrigel matrix in mTeSR1 medium. Further, hPSCs cultured on a Matrigel matrix in mTeSR1 medium were found to be more committed to neural lineage than hPSCs cultured on MEF or SNL feeder cell layers. In conclusion, culture conditions have a major impact on the propensity of the hPSCs to differentiate into a cardiac lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2153008171,"Acute alcohol intake is known to enhance inhibition through facilitation of GABAA receptors, which are present in 40% of the synapses all over the brain. Evidence suggests that enhanced GABAergic transmission leads to increased large-scale brain connectivity. Our hypothesis is that acute alcohol intake would increase the functional connectivity of the human brain resting-state network (RSN). To test our hypothesis, electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements were recorded from healthy social drinkers at rest, during eyes-open and eyes-closed sessions, after administering to them an alcoholic beverage or placebo respectively. Salivary alcohol and cortisol served to measure the inebriation and stress levels. By calculating Magnitude Square Coherence (MSC) on standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) solutions, we formed cortical networks over several frequency bands, which were then analyzed in the context of functional connectivity and graph theory. MSC was increased (p<0.05, corrected with False Discovery Rate, FDR corrected) in alpha, beta (eyes-open) and theta bands (eyes-closed) following acute alcohol intake. Graph parameters were accordingly altered in these bands quantifying the effect of alcohol on the structure of brain networks; global efficiency and density were higher and path length was lower during alcohol (vs. placebo, p<0.05). Salivary alcohol concentration was positively correlated with the density of the network in beta band. The degree of specific nodes was elevated following alcohol (vs. placebo). Our findings support the hypothesis that short-term inebriation considerably increases large-scale connectivity in the RSN. The increased baseline functional connectivity can -at least partially- be attributed to the alcohol-induced disruption of the delicate balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in favor of inhibitory influences. Thus, it is suggested that short-term inebriation is associated, as expected, to increased GABA transmission and functional connectivity, while long-term alcohol consumption may be linked to exactly the opposite effect."
https://openalex.org/W2015116329,"RNA helicases are ubiquitous enzymes whose modification of RNA secondary structure is known to regulate RNA function. The pathways controlling RNA helicase expression, however, have not been well characterized. Expression of the cyanobacterial RNA helicase, crhR, is regulated in response to environmental signals that alter the redox poise of the electron transport chain, including light and temperature. Here we analyze crhR expression in response to alteration of abiotic conditions in wild type and a crhR mutant, providing evidence that CrhR autoregulates its own expression through a combination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Temperature regulates crhR expression through alteration of both transcript and protein half-life which are significantly extended at low temperature (20°C). CrhR-dependent mechanisms regulate both the transient accumulation of crhR transcript at 20°C and stability of the CrhR protein at all temperatures. CrhR-independent mechanisms regulate temperature sensing and induction of crhR transcript accumulation at 20°C and the temperature regulation of crhR transcript stability, suggesting CrhR is not directly associated with crhR mRNA turnover. Many of the processes are CrhR- and temperature-dependent and occur in the absence of a correlation between crhR transcript and protein abundance. The data provide important insights into not only how RNA helicase gene expression is regulated but also the role that rearrangement of RNA secondary structure performs in the molecular response to temperature stress. We propose that the crhR-regulatory pathway exhibits characteristics similar to the heat shock response rather than a cold stress-specific mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2087828962,"The inner ears of adult humans and other mammals possess a limited capacity for regenerating sensory hair cells, which can lead to permanent auditory and vestibular deficits. During development and regeneration, undifferentiated supporting cells within inner ear sensory epithelia can self-renew and give rise to new hair cells; however, these otic progenitors become depleted postnatally. Therefore, reprogramming differentiated supporting cells into otic progenitors is a potential strategy for restoring regenerative potential to the ear. Transient expression of the induced pluripotency transcription factors, Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc reprograms fibroblasts into neural progenitors under neural-promoting culture conditions, so as a first step, we explored whether ectopic expression of these factors can reverse supporting cell quiescence in whole organ cultures of adult mouse utricles. Co-infection of utricles with adenoviral vectors separately encoding Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2, and the degradation-resistant T58A mutant of c-Myc (c-MycT58A) triggered significant levels of supporting cell S-phase entry as assessed by continuous BrdU labeling. Of the four factors, c-MycT58A alone was both necessary and sufficient for the proliferative response. The number of BrdU-labeled cells plateaued between 5–7 days after infection, and then decreased ∼60% by 3 weeks, as many cycling cells appeared to enter apoptosis. Switching to differentiation-promoting culture medium at 5 days after ectopic expression of c-MycT58A temporarily attenuated the loss of BrdU-labeled cells and accompanied a very modest but significant expansion of the sensory epithelium. A small number of the proliferating cells in these cultures labeled for the hair cell marker, myosin VIIA, suggesting they had begun differentiating towards a hair cell fate. The results indicate that ectopic expression of c-MycT58A in combination with methods for promoting cell survival and differentiation may restore regenerative potential to supporting cells within the adult mammalian inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2018795314,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are known for their robust antiviral response and their pro-tolerance effects towards allergic diseases and tissue engraftments. However, little is known about the role pDCs may play during a bacterial infection, including pulmonary Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP). In this study, we investigated the role of pDCs during pulmonary CP infection. Our results revealed that depletion of pDCs during acute CP infection in mice results in delayed and reduced lung inflammation, with an early delay in cellular recruitment and significant reduction in early cytokine production in the lungs. This was followed by impaired and delayed bacterial clearance from the lungs which then resulted in a severe and prolonged chronic inflammation and iBALT like structures containing large numbers of B and T cells in these animals. We also observed that increasing the pDC numbers in the lung by FLT3L treatment experimentally results in greater lung inflammation during acute CP infection. In contrast to these results, restimulation of T-cells in the draining lymph nodes of pDC-depleted mice induced greater amounts of proinflammatory cytokines than we observed in control mice. These results suggest that pDCs in the lung may provide critical proinflammatory innate immune responses in response to CP infection, but are suppressive towards adaptive immune responses in the lymph node. Thus pDCs in the lung and the draining lymph node appear to have different roles and phenotypes during acute CP infection and may play a role in host immune responses."

https://openalex.org/W2141292418,"Cell-mediated transmission and dissemination of sexually-acquired human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in the host involves the migration of immature dendritic cells (iDCs). iDCs migrate in response to the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120, and inhibiting such migration may limit the mucosal transmission of HIV-1. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism of HIV-1-gp120-induced transendothelial migration of iDCs. We found that gp120 enhanced the binding of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) and the Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex with β-actin, an interaction essential for the proper formation of podosomes, specialized adhesion structures required for the migration of iDCs through different tissues. We further identified Leukocyte-Specific Protein 1 (LSP1) as a novel component of the WASp-Arp2/3-β-actin complex. Pretreating iDCs with an active fragment of the secretory glycoprotein Slit2 (Slit2N) inhibited HIV-1-gp120-mediated migration and podosome formation, by inducing the cognate receptor Roundabout 1 (Robo1) to bind to and sequester WASp and LSP1 from β-actin. Slit2N treatment also inhibited Src signaling and the activation of several downstream molecules, including Rac1, Pyk2, paxillin, and CDC42, a major regulator of podosome formation. Taken together, our results support a novel mechanism by which Slit2/Robo1 may inhibit the HIV-1-gp120-induced migration of iDCs, thereby restricting dissemination of HIV-1 from mucosal surfaces in the host."

Female mice lacking leptin and insulin receptors in pro-opiomelanocortin neurons (IR/LepR(POMC) mice) and littermate controls were evaluated for estrous cyclicity, ovarian and adipose tissue morphology, and body composition by QMR and CT scan. Tissue-specific macrophage infiltration and cytokine mRNA expression were measured, as well as circulating cytokine levels. Finally, glucose regulation during pregnancy was evaluated as a measure of risk for diabetes development. Forty-five percent of IR/LepR(POMC) mice showed reduced or absent ovulation. IR/LepR(POMC) mice also had increased fat mass and adipocyte hypertrophy. These traits accompanied elevations in macrophage accumulation and inflammatory cytokine production in perigonadal adipose tissue, liver, and ovary. These mice also exhibited gestational hyperglycemia as predicted. This report is the first to show the presence of inflammation in IR/LepR(POMC) mice, which develop a PCOS-like phenotype. Thus, IR/LepR(POMC) mice may serve as a new mouse model to clarify the involvement of adipose and liver tissue in the pathogenesis and etiology of PCOS, allowing more targeted research on the development of PCOS and potential therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2094113514,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted much interest in oncology since they exhibit marked tropism for the tumor microenvironment and support or suppress malignant cell growth depending on the tumor model tested. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MSCs in the control of the growth of neuroblastoma (NB), which is the second most common solid tumor in children. In vivo experiments showed that systemically administered MSCs, under our experimental conditions, did not home to tumor sites and did not affect tumor growth or survival. However, MSCs injected intratumorally in an established subcutaneous NB model reduced tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of NB cells and prolonged the survival of hMSC-treated mice. The need for contact between MSCs and NB cells was further supported by in vitro experiments. In particular, MSCs were found to be attracted by NB cells, and to affect NB cell proliferation with different results depending on the cell line tested. Moreover, NB cells, after pre-incubation with hMSCs, acquired a more invasive behavior towards CXCL12 and the bone marrow, i.e., the primary site of NB metastases. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that functional cross-talk between MSCs and NB cell lines used in our experiments can occur only within short range interaction. Thus, this report does not support the clinical use of MSCs as vehicles for selective delivery of antitumor drugs at the NB site unless chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy create suitable local conditions for MSCs recruitment."

We investigate changes in functional connectivity, measured as cortico-cortical coherence (CCC), between rest blocks and the performance of a visually directed motor task in a healthy cohort. Task-positive changes in CCC were interpreted in the context of any concomitant modulations in spectral power. Task-related increases in whole-head CCC relative to the resting state were identified between areas established as part of the sensorimotor network as well as frontal eye fields and prefrontal cortices, predominantly in the beta and gamma frequency bands.

Nevertheless, the molecular reasons behind this drop, and whether it is a cause or an effect of disease progression is still poorly understood. With the skin and the liver, the kidney is one of the most important sites for vitamin D metabolism. Previous studies have also shown that CYP24A1 (an enzyme implicated in vitamin D metabolism), might play an important role in furthering the progression of kidney lesions during diabetic nephropathy. In this study we show a link between CYP24A1 increase and senescence followed by apoptosis induction in the renal proximal tubules of diabetic kidneys. We show that CYP24A1 expression was increased during diabetic nephropathy progression. This increase derived from protein kinase C activation and increased H2O2 cellular production. CYP24A1 increase had a major impact on cellular phenotype, by pushing cells into senescence, and later into apoptosis. Our data suggest that control of CYP24A1 increase during diabetes has a beneficial effect on senescence induction and caspase-3 increased expression. We concluded that diabetes induces an increase in CYP24A1 expression, destabilizing vitamin D metabolism in the renal proximal tubules, leading to cellular instability and apoptosis, and thereby accelerating tubular injury progression during diabetic nephropathy."

Seroepidemiology of pertussis has been widely described in industrialized countries, but rare are the studies referring to it in developing countries.We conducted a longitudinal survey in Northern Senegal to investigate the epidemiology of B. pertussis by evaluating the IgG antibody (Ab) response against pertussis toxin (PT). A cohort of 410 children aged 1 to 9 from five villages in the Middle Senegal River Valley were followed-up for 18 months. During that period, five visits were made to assess the immunological status of the children.PT-specific IgG responses were significantly different according to age. Until the age of 3, there was a decrease in the Ab response, which then increased in the older groups. Assessment of IgG antibodies to PT (IgG-PT) suggested evidence of recent exposures to the pathogen. Surprisingly, in one of the five villages the average Ab response to PT was very low at all ages during the first 6 months of the study. At the third visit, IgG-PT concentrations peaked to very high levels, to slightly decline at the end of the survey. This indicates an outbreak of B. pertussis, whereas in the other villages a pertussis endemic profile could be observed.Pertussis is endemic in Northern Senegal despite the introduction of vaccination.

https://openalex.org/W2056808363,"Fragile X syndrome is a common inherited form of mental retardation caused by the lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) because of Fmr1 gene silencing. Serotonin (5-HT) is significantly increased in the null mutants of Drosophila Fmr1, and elevated 5-HT brain levels result in cognitive and behavioral deficits in human patients. The serotonin type 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex; it acts on pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons to modulate cortical functions. 5-HT2AR and FMRP both regulate synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the lack of FMRP may affect serotoninergic activity. In this study, we determined the involvement of FMRP in the 5-HT modulation of synaptic potentiation with the use of primary cortical neuron culture and brain slice recording. Pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT2AR by R-96544 or ketanserin facilitated long-term potentiation (LTP) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of WT mice. The prefrontal LTP induction was dependent on the activation of NMDARs and elevation of postsynaptic Ca(2+) concentrations. By contrast, inhibition of 5-HT2AR could not restore the induction of LTP in the ACC of Fmr1 knock-out mice. Furthermore, 5-HT2AR inhibition induced AMPA receptor GluR1 subtype surface insertion in the cultured ACC neurons of Fmr1 WT mice, however, GluR1 surface insertion by inhibition of 5-HT2AR was impaired in the neurons of Fmr1KO mice. These findings suggested that FMRP was involved in serotonin receptor signaling and contributed in GluR1 surface expression induced by 5-HT2AR inactivation."

Epiphyte and vine abundance is primarily affected by the internal characteristics of patches (such as tree size, the presence of logging gaps or the proximity to patch edges) rather than patch and landscape features (such as patch size, shape or connectivity). These responses were intimately related to species-specific characteristics such as drought- or shade-tolerance. Our study therefore suggests that plant responses to fragmentation are contingent on both the species' ecology and the specific pathways through which the study area is being fragmented, (i.e. extensive logging that shaped the boundaries of current forest patches plus recent, unregulated logging that creates gaps within patches). Management practices in fragmented landscapes should therefore consider habitat quality within patches together with other spatial attributes at landscape or patch scales."
https://openalex.org/W2048087272,"Natural number arithmetic is a simple, powerful and important symbolic system. Despite intense focus on learning in cognitive development and educational research many adults have weak knowledge of the system. In current study participants learn arithmetic principles via an implicit learning paradigm. Participants learn not by solving arithmetic equations, but through viewing and evaluating example equations, similar to the implicit learning of artificial grammars. We expand this to the symbolic arithmetic system. Specifically we find that exposure to principle-inconsistent examples facilitates the acquisition of arithmetic principle knowledge if the equations are presented to the learning in a temporally proximate fashion. The results expand on research of the implicit learning of regularities and suggest that contrasting cases, show to facilitate explicit arithmetic learning, is also relevant to implicit learning of arithmetic."
https://openalex.org/W1967130275,"Background Flowering synchrony and floral sex ratio have the potential to influence the mating opportunities and reproductive success through female function. Here, we examine the variances in synchronous display of female and male function, ratio of male to female flowers per day and subsequently reproductive output in small populations of two monoecious plants, Sagittaria trifolia and Sagittaria graminea. Methodology/Principal Finding We created plant populations of size 2, 4, 10 and 20 and recorded the daily number of blooming male and female flowers per plant to determine daily floral display, flowering synchrony index and ratio of male to female flowers per day. We also harvested the fruits, counted the seeds and calculated the number of fruits and seeds per flower to measure reproductive success through female function. There is less overlap in flowering time of female and male function in smaller populations than in larger populations. Most importantly, we found that male-biased floral sex ratio and imbalanced display period of female and male function for individual plant can lead to a population-size-dependent ratio of male to female flowers per day. Increasing ratio of male to female flowers per day was generally associated with a greater percentage of fruit production. Conclusions/Significance Our results highlight the importance of flowering synchrony of female and male function and population-size-dependent ratio of male to female flowers per day for female reproductive success. This finding improves our understanding of a mechanism that reduces reproductive success in small populations."
