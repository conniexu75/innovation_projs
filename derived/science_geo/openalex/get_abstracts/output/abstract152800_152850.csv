https://openalex.org/W2076935230,"Electrophiles and reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Transcription factor Nrf2 was recently identified as a general regulator of one defense mechanism against such havoc. Nrf2 regulates the inducible expression of a group of detoxication enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, via antioxidant response elements. Using peritoneal macrophages from Nrf2-deficient mice, we show here that Nrf2 also controls the expression of a group of electrophile- and oxidative stress-inducible proteins and activities, which includes heme oxygenase-1, A170, peroxiredoxin MSP23, and cystine membrane transport (system xc−) activity. The response to electrophilic and reactive oxygen species-producing agents was profoundly impaired in Nrf2-deficient cells. The lack of induction of system xc− activity resulted in the minimum level of intracellular glutathione, and Nrf2-deficient cells were more sensitive to toxic electrophiles. Several stress agents induced the DNA binding activity of Nrf2 in the nucleus without increasing its mRNA level. Thus Nrf2 regulates a wide-ranging metabolic response to oxidative stress.

Am. J. Med. 1991; 91: 31-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Treatment of mammalian cells with electrophilic agents usually provokes cellular responses, including transcriptional activation of genes encoding proteins that partake in the defense against oxidative stress. This process is referred to as the electrophile counterattack response (2.Prestera T. Zhang Y. Spencer S.R. Wilczak C.A. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme. Regul. 1993; 33: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Through analyses of mouse and rat glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya subunit genes and the rat NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) subunit gene, the cis-acting element responsible for the induction by electrophiles was independently identified as an electrophile-responsive element (EpRE) (3.Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) or antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) (4.Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus ARE sequence has been extensively characterized (5.Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The consensus binding sequence of erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 shows high similarity to the ARE/EpRE sequence. Also, the expression profile of Nrf2, one of the NF-E2 subunit factors, overlaps with those of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as GST and NQO1. Based on these facts, we recently demonstrated that transcription factor Nrf2 (6.Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan W.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 7.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1995; 209: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is essential for the coordinated transcriptional activation of genes encoding the drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as GST and NQO1, via AREs/EpREs (9.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Nrf2-deficient mice fed with butylated hydroxyanisole, which normally leads to a pronounced up-regulation of Alpha, Pi, and Mu classes of GSTs and NQO1, failed to induce either of these detoxication enzymes in the liver or intestine (9.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Since these detoxication enzymes decrease the level of oxidative stress by removing compounds capable of generating ROS or other highly reactive substances, they thereby constitute part of the defense mechanism against oxidative stress (10.Prestera T. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8965-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Because ARE-type cis-acting sequences are frequently found in the regulatory regions of a number of other oxidative stress-inducible genes (5.Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 11.Inamdar N.M. Ahn Y.I. Alam J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Nrf2 might also serve as the key transcription factor activating these genes. A number of defense proteins and activities in murine peritoneal macrophages are markedly induced upon exposure to electrophilic agents or other oxidative stresses. These proteins include heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (14.Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 15.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc.

(Tokyo). 1990; 108: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), peroxiredoxin MSP23 (17.Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H. Matsue M. Taketani S. Nakayama K. Sugita Y. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18633-18636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cystine membrane transporter (system xc−) (18.Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and 60-kDa stress protein A170 (19.Ishii T. Yanagawa T. Kawane T. Yuki K. Seita J. Yoshida H. Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HO-1 is prominently induced under various oxidative stress conditions in many different cell types (14.Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). HO-1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts are hypersensitive to the cytotoxicity of both hemin and hydrogen peroxide (15.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Induction of system xc− activity increases the intracellular cysteine pool, which consequently augments the synthesis of GSH (20.Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a potent antioxidant with a short half-life. MSP23 is the murine peroxiredoxin I with antioxidative activity (21.Ishii T. Kawane T. Taketani S. Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that a mammalian peroxiredoxin isoform reduces the intracellular hydrogen peroxide level utilizing thioredoxin as an immediate electron donor (22.Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and protects cells from apoptosis by oxidative stress (23.Zhang P.

A170 has a structural domain that interacts with ubiquitin (24.Vadlamudi R.K. Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20235-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and PKC-ζ (25.Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Electrophilic agents, such as diethylmaleate (DEM), and other oxidative stress agents have been reported to induce the proteins HO-1, A170, MSP23, and system xc− activity in peritoneal macrophages (20.Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (26.Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2435-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these antioxidant stress proteins are also under the regulation of Nrf2, we examined in this study the electrophilic induction of this group of genes in peritoneal macrophages from the nrf2-null mutant mouse. Female wild type ICR andnrf2 mutant mice (9.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar) weighing 20–25 g received an intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate broth. Four days later, macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage (17.Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H. Matsue M. Taketani S. Nakayama K. Sugita Y. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18633-18636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended at 7.5 × 105 cells/ml and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum as described previously (17.Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H. Matsue M. Taketani S. Nakayama K. Sugita Y. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18633-18636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (27.Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 15: 936-942Google Scholar) assay, the cells were resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml and cultured in medium without fetal bovine serum. After 1 h of culture, stress agents were added to the medium. Final concentrations of the agents in the medium were 100 μm for DEM, paraquat, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); 80 μm for catechol; 20 milliunits/ml for glucose oxidase (GO); 5 μm for CdCl2 and menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone); 10 μm for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB); 20 μm for iodoacetic acid; 2.5 μm for t-butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ) and sodium arsenite (NaAsO2); and 1 ng/ml for lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The macrophages were harvested at the times indicated in the figure legends. Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay (27.Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 15: 936-942Google Scholar) and the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Total cellular RNA was extracted from macrophages by RNAzolTM B (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX). The RNA samples (10 μg) were electrophoresed and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes as indicated in the figure legends. β-Actin cDNA was used as a positive control. Macrophages were solubilized with SDS-sample buffer (without dye or 2-mercaptoethanol), and protein concentrations were estimated by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and electrotransferred onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To detect immunoreactive proteins, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and ECL blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against rat HO-1, rat MSP23, and recombinant murine A170 were used as described previously (19.Ishii T. Yanagawa T. Kawane T. Yuki K. Seita J. Yoshida H. Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21.Ishii T. Kawane T. Taketani S. Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specific antibody was raised against Nrf2 by immunizing rabbits with recombinant Nrf2 protein (amino acids 140–318 fused with E. colimaltose-binding protein). An anti-actin antiserum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image software. Cystine transport activity was measured using 14C-labeled cystine in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% glucose as described previously (20.Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Total (i.e. reduced plus oxidized) GSH was extracted from macrophages with 5% trichloroacetic acid solution, and GSH content was measured as described previously (20.Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The quail fibroblast cell line QT6 (28.Moscovici C. Moscovici M.G. Jimenez H. Lai M.M. Hayman M.J. Vogt P.K. Cell. 1977; 11: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and seeded in 24-well dishes 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with reporter (pHO-1-Luc (see “Results”) and pRBGP2 (7.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar)) plasmids and an effector plasmid (cNrf2; Ref. 7.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Luciferase assay was performed by utilizing the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) following the supplier's protocol and measured in a Biolumat Luminometer (Berthold, Germany). Transfection efficiencies were routinely normalized to the activity of a co-transfected β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pENL. Normally, three independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate, were performed, and the results were averaged. The cells were washed 12 h after transfection, and then DEM (Wako, Tokyo) was immediately added to the culture medium. Nuclear extracts were prepared from macrophages as described previously (7.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide containing the stress-responsive element of theho-1 AB1 enhancer (5′-TCTGTTTTCGCTGAGTCATGGTTCCCGTTG-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSA was performed as described previously (7.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Where indicated, antibodies were included in the binding reaction at 1:10 to 1:100 dilutions. The anti-chicken MafK antibody was described previously (9.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar), and that against human Nrf2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was included in the reaction (7.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A number of proteins or activities are induced by electrophilic agents in murine peritoneal macrophages. To test whether the electrophilic induction of this group of genes shares a common regulatory mechanism with that of the drug-metabolizing enzymes, we examined their expression in Nrf2-deficient macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from nrf2-homozygous and -heterozygous mutant (or wild type) female ICR siblings. The macrophages were then independently challenged with DEM (an electrophilic agent), paraquat (an O⨪2 generator), GO (an H2O2generator), or CdCl2 (heavy metal). After challenging macrophages with these agents, we examined expression levels of three oxidative stress-inducible proteins (below) by immunoblotting and RNA blotting analyses. Since wild type and heterozygous mutant mice did not show large differences in induction of the antioxidative proteins, we used both types of macrophages as positive controls. We first measured the levels of HO-1, MSP23, and A170 proteins 1 h after the start of in vitro culture and found that the basal levels of these proteins in the heterozygous macrophages were similar to those of nrf2-homozygous mutant macrophages (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 7). After transfer of thenrf2-heterozygous cells to in vitroculture, these stress-inducible proteins were gradually induced by unknown mechanisms (compare lanes 1 and2). The gradual induction of HO-1 and MSP23 expression was not seen in Nrf2-deficient cells (lanes 2and 8). The important finding here was that whereas all of the stress agents tested induced HO-1, MSP23, and A170 innrf2-heterozygous cells, induction was largely canceled in Nrf2-deficient cells. Closer examination revealed that in nrf2-null mutant cells (lanes 9–12) induction of HO-1 and A170 by DEM and GO was severely affected, but induction by paraquat and CdCl2 was less impaired. In contrast, while MSP23 was markedly induced by these agents in nrf2-heterozygous cells, induction was largely absent in nrf2-null mutant cells. We also examined induction of these proteins by other stress agents: catechol, CDNB, H2O2, iodoacetic acid, sodium arsenite, menadione, and t-BHQ. Quantitative analysis by densitometry of the stained bands is shown in Table I. Menadione and catechol induced HO-1 in the Nrf2-deficient cells at levels comparable with those in nrf2-heterozygous mutant cells, suggesting the involvement of signal-transducing pathway(s) other than the Nrf2 system. Apparently, induction of HO-1 by sodium arsenite, t-BHQ, CDNB, and iodoacetic acid is largely, if not exclusively, dependent on the presence of Nrf2. A significant increase of MSP23 by all stress agents except sodium arsenite, H2O2, and iodoacetic acid was also observed in the heterozygous mutant cells but not in homozygous mutant cells (Table I). These results thus indicate that inducible expression of MSP23 is regulated mainly through the ARE/Nrf2 system.Table IQuantitative analysis of the induction of HO-1 and MSP23 proteins by various stress agentsAgentsHO-1MSP23Nrf2 (+/−)Nrf2 (−/−)Nrf2 (+/−)Nrf2 (−/−)relative absorbanceNone (1 h)0.58 ± 0.020.50 ± 0.190.60 ± 0.170.50 ± 0.25None (9 h)1.000.57 ± 0.121.000.50 ± 0.16DEM1.67 ± 0.170.69 ± 0.041.83 ± 0.040.54 ± 0.30CDNB2.94 ± 0.210.77 ± 0.021.51 ± 0.690.34 ± 0.08GO1.22 ± 0.020.57 ± 0.071.51 ± 0.020.34 ± 0.21H2O21.26 ± 0.100.55 ± 0.060.97 ± 0.270.38 ± 0.14t-BHQ1.91 ± 0.770.86 ± 0.471.58 ± 0.070.44 ± 0.27Menadione6.38 ± 3.934.54 ± 2.761.94 ± 0.100.58 ± 0.21Catechol3.70 ± 0.021.77 ± 0.061.75 ± 0.060.52 ± 0.17CdCl21.57 ± 0.141.21 ± 0.081.38 ± 0.220.35 ± 0.15Paraquat1.34 ± 0.030.88 ± 0.031.50 ± 0.280.55 ± 0.25NaAsO23.70 ± 1.301.08 ± 0.511.01 ± 0.110.43 ± 0.16Iodoacetic acid2.05 ± 0.100.98 ± 0.271.15 ± 0.170.60 ± 0.27The protein levels were calculated from densitometrical analysis of the immunoblot bands.

The standard levels (1.00) are those of cells cultured for 9 h without agents. The culture conditions are the same as in Fig. 1 A. To assess the induction process at the level of transcription, RNA was extracted from macrophages that had been treated with various stress agents and analyzed by the RNA blot analysis. Treatment with stress agents significantly increased the levels of HO-1 and MSP23 mRNA innrf2-heterozygous cells (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–6), but the induction was markedly impaired in nrf2-null mutant cells (lanes 7–12). In contrast, whereas the lack of the induction of A170 mRNA in nrf2-null mutant cells was evident when DEM was used as the stress agent, the induction was only partially affected in Nrf2-deficient cells when paraquat, GO, or CdCl2 was used as an inducer. Marked induction of the genes was also observed in the nrf2-heterozygous cells treated with menadione, t-BHQ, catechol, or CDNB (data not shown). The induction of HO-1 mRNA by menadione and catechol was diminished in Nrf2-null mutant cells, while that byt-BHQ and CDNB was largely abolished. Induction of MSP23 mRNA by all of these agents was markedly impaired innrf2-null mutant cells. The three oxidative stress-inducible genes we addressed here showed roughly comparable variation in the mRNA and protein levels in response to various stress agents (Fig. 1, compare A and B, and data not shown). These results thus indicate that Nrf2 regulates the stress agent-mediated induction of HO-1, MSP23, and A170 gene expression. The results also clearly show that the contribution of Nrf2 to the transcriptional activation of these genes differed based upon the stress-inducing agent. Because oxidative stress agents transcriptionally induce system xc−activity in macrophages (20.Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26.Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2435-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the stress induction of system xc− activity innrf2-null mutant cells was examined next (Fig.2 A). Whereasnrf2-heterozygous cells show system xc− activity comparable with that of wild type cells under both basal and induced conditions (data not shown), the oxidative stress agents DEM, paraquat, GO, and CdCl2 barely induced system xc− activity innrf2-null mutant cells (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, LPS, a well known inducer of system xc− activity (30.Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), significantly induced the system xc− activity even innrf2-null mutant cells, indicating that LPS induction is mediated through an alternative regulatory pathway rather than the Nrf2 pathway. These results argue that the transcription of the cystine transporter gene may be under the regulatory influence of Nrf2. It should be noted that system xc−activity is necessary to maintain a high GSH level in cultured macrophages, since cysteine is easily oxidized to cystine upon exposure to air (18.Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). While the addition of 500 μm to 1 mm of DEM to the culture medium depletes the intracellular stores of GSH significantly, the addition of 100 μm DEM only diminishes the GSH level minimally, and then its level increases as a result of induced system xc−activity (26.Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2435-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the defect in inducible expression of system xc− activity innrf2-null mutant cells resulted in a decrease in cellular GSH content; after a 24-h incubation with DEM, the GSH level dropped to less than half its original level (Fig. 2 B). The AB1 and SX2 enhancers of theho-1 gene (31.Alam J. J. Biol.

Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Due to their responsiveness to a wide variety of stress agents including oxidative stress, the MAREs were also named stress-responsive elements (StREs) (31.Alam J. J. Biol.

To ask whether Nrf2 can regulate the expression of this antioxidative stress gene via the ho-1AB1 enhancer, we co-transfected a Nrf2 expression plasmid and aho-1 AB1 enhancer-luciferase (pHO-1-Luc) reporter or β-globin enhancer-luciferase (pRBGP2) reporter into QT6 fibroblasts (Fig. 3 A). DEM (Fig.3 B) and Nrf2 overexpression (Fig. 3 C) both activated HO-1-Luc reporter gene expression, with the highest concentrations of these agents generating more than 10-fold activation. This increase was strictly dependent on the presence of the AB1 enhancer (data not shown). We also tested a pRBGP2 reporter that contains three tandem copies of the NF-E2 binding sequence of the chicken β-globin enhancer (7.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), a sequence that is very similar to the AB1 enhancer sequence. Interestingly, the pRBGP2 reporter responded more efficiently than the pHO-1-Luc reporter did to both DEM and the overexpression of Nrf2 (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that StREs in the AB1 enhancer are actually responsible for the activation of ho-1 gene expression and that Nrf2 can activate the ho-1 gene expression through StREs. Given the clear lack of inductive response in a number of electrophile-inducible genes, it was of interest to determine how oxidative stress agents activate Nrf2 and thereby induce a group of genes to counteract oxidative stress. To this end, we first examined the level of Nrf2 mRNA in macrophages under various oxidative stresses and found that the mRNA level was not changed significantly by any of the oxidative stress agents tested (Fig.4 A). In contrast, we found that these same stress agents significantly enhanced the DNA binding activity of Nrf2 to the StRE of HO-1 AB1 enhancer. StRE binding activity in nuclear extracts was strongly induced by DEM treatment of macrophages, as revealed by the retarded band (arrow in Fig. 4 B, lanes 1and 2). The induction of binding activity was not observed in nuclear extracts prepared from nrf2-deficient cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and4). The complex was effectively competed by the addition of an excess of unlabeled StRE, mouse GST Ya gene ARE, or chicken β-globin enhancer NF-E2 binding site but not by a yeast Gal4 binding consensus sequence (Fig. 4 D). This DNA-protein complex was markedly diminished by treatment with antibodies against mouse Nrf2 (Fig. 4 C, lane 3) and chicken MafK (lane 4), which are partner molecules together comprising the heterodimeric transcription factor complex (34.Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), but the decrease was not obvious using a normal rabbit IgG (lane 5). These results indicate that the DNA-protein complex contains both Nrf2 and small Maf proteins. The same binding activity was also induced in nuclear extracts of macrophages treated with GO, paraquat, or CdCl2 (Fig.4 E). The Nrf2 expression level was also examined by immunoblotting analyses of nuclear extracts prepared from the macrophages treated with these stress agents. We found that DEM, GO, paraquat, CdCl2, and CDNB all increased the Nrf2 level 1.5–3-fold (Fig. 4 F). We therefore concluded that post-transcriptional regulation might be involved in the activation of Nrf2 by electrophilic agents and ROS. The analysis thus f"

Evidence suggests that p53 induces cell death by a multitude of molecular pathways involving activation of target genes and transcriptionally independent direct signaling. Mitochondria play a key role in apoptosis. We show here that a fraction of p53 protein localizes to mitochondria at the onset of p53-dependent apoptosis but not during p53-independent apoptosis or p53-mediated cell cycle arrest. The accumulation of p53 to mitochondria is rapid (within 1 h after p53 activation) and precedes changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome<i>c</i> release, and procaspase-3 activation. Immunoelectron microscopy and immuno-fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of isolated mitochondria show that the majority of mitochondrial p53 localizes to the membranous compartment, whereas a fraction is found in a complex with the mitochondrial import motor mt hsp70. After induction of ectopic p53 without additional DNA damage in p53-deficient cells, p53 again partially localizes to mitochondria, preceding the onset of apoptosis. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL abrogates stress signal-mediated mitochondrial p53 accumulation and apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest, suggesting a feedback signaling loop between p53 and mitochondrial apoptotic regulators. Importantly, bypassing the nucleus by targeting p53 to mitochondria using import leader fusions is sufficient to induce apoptosis in p53-deficient cells. We propose a model where p53 can contribute to apoptosis by direct signaling at the mitochondria, thereby amplifying the transcription-dependent apoptosis of p53."

https://openalex.org/W2140793658,"The SOCS proteins are induced by several cytokines and are involved in negative feedback loops. Here we demonstrate that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin, a hormone whose receptor does not belong to the cytokine receptor family, induces SOCS-3 expression but not CIS or SOCS-2. Using transfection of COS-7 cells, we show that insulin induction of SOCS-3 is enhanced upon Stat5B expression. Moreover, Stat5B from insulin-stimulated cells binds directly to a Stat element present in the SOCS-3 promoter. Once induced, SOCS-3 inhibits insulin activation of Stat5B without modifying the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Two pieces of evidence suggest that this negative regulation likely results from competition between SOCS-3 and Stat5B binding to the same insulin receptor motif. First, using a yeast two-hybrid system, we show that SOCS-3 binds to the insulin receptor at phosphotyrosine 960, which is precisely where Stat5B binds. Second, using confocal microscopy, we show that insulin induces translocation of SOCS-3 from an intracellular compartment to the cell membrane, leading to colocalization of SOCS-3 with the insulin receptor. This colocalization is dependent upon phosphorylation of insulin receptor tyrosine 960. Indeed, in cells expressing an insulin receptor mutant in which tyrosine 960 has been mutated to phenylalanine, insulin does not modify the cellular localization of SOCS-3. We have thus revealed an insulin target gene of which the expression is potentiated upon Stat5B activation. By inhibiting insulin-stimulated Stat5B, SOCS-3 appears to function as a negative regulator of insulin signaling.

They share a homologous structure, an N-terminal region of variable length, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal SOCS box. The SOCS are rapidly induced by various cytokines in a tissue-specific manner (4.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A.

Once expressed, they participate in a negative feedback loop by inhibiting cytokine-mediated Jak-Stat activation. The function of the SOCS is assumed to be solely regulated at the transcriptional level. An IL-21-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 has been described, but its role is undefined (6.Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The SOCS proteins inhibit the Jak-Stat pathway by various mechanisms. Through their SH2 domains they bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated cytokine receptors. For instance, CIS binds to the β chain of the IL-3 receptor and to the EPO receptor (1.Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), whereas SOCS-1 binds to the kit receptor tyrosine kinase (7.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These associations can lead to a competitive inhibition with SH2 domain-containing molecules (such as the Stats) or to the recruitment of other signaling molecules to the receptors. Indeed, SOCS-1 binds to SH3-containing proteins such as Grb-2 and Vav via a di-proline determinant, specific for SOCS-1 (7.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Using its SH2 domain and an additional N-terminal 12-amino acid sequence, SOCS-1 binds to and inhibits the Jak tyrosine kinases (8.Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T.

More recently, it has been shown that the SOCS box binds to elongins B and C, but the resulting effect on SOCS stability is a matter of debate (10.Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.J.

Transgene-mediated expression of SOCS-3 blocks fetal erythropoiesis, resulting in embryonic lethality, and SOCS-3 deletion results also in embryonic lethality associated with marked erythrocytosis (15.Marine J.C.

So far the induction of the SOCS seems to be restricted to activators of the cytokine receptor family, such as LIF, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, interferon γ, GH, and leptin. The induction of the SOCS is thought to be mediated through Stat elements present in the promoters of the different SOCS (2.Ohya K. Kajiyaga S. Yamashita Y. Miyazoto A. Hatake K. Miura Y. Ikeda U.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although Stat activation is the hallmark of cytokines action, these transcription factors can be activated by other agents. Indeed, stimulation of serpentine receptors such as the angiotensin II receptor leads to the activation of Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 (18.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinase receptors are also potential Stat activators. Stat1 and Stat3 belong to the signaling pathway of the epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptors (19.Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). By performing a yeast two-hybrid screen using the insulin receptor as a probe we (20.Sawka-Verhelle D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) show that Stat5B is a direct substrate of the insulin receptor. Insulin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5B in transfected cells (20.Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare D.S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) but also in rhabdomyosarcoma cells (22.Storz P. H D.p. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and perfused rat liver (21.Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5B leads to its activation, as measured by its ability to bind a cDNA probe corresponding to the Stat5 binding site from the β-casein promoter. Taken together, these studies bring at least the two following insights to insulin action. (i) Insulin can induce gene transcription by a signaling circuitry distinct from the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent transcription factors; (ii) a direct signaling path linking the cell surface insulin receptor and the nucleus might control hormonal effects on gene expression. Here we show that insulin induces the expression of SOCS-3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In COS-7 cells, insulin-induced transcription of SOCS-3 is enhanced by Stat5B. Once expressed, SOCS-3 inhibits activation of Stat5B by insulin and appears thus to function as an inhibitor of insulin signaling. This inhibition is thought to be the result of a binding competition between Stat5B and SOCS-3 to the insulin receptor, since both molecules bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor. This was observed by a yeast two-hybrid system and by confocal microscopy in intact cells. In conclusion, our study identifies SOCS-3 as an insulin-induced negative regulator of hormone signaling. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). They were grown and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (23.Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Classically 80% of the cells were differentiated after 10 to 15 days. COS-7 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. 3T3-L1 and COS-7 were starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (w/v) before use. Total RNAs from 100-mm dishes were isolated with the Trizol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). 15 μg of total RNA was denatured in formamide and formaldehyde and subsequently separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. RNA was transferred to Hybond membranes (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Full-length SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS cDNAs were used as probes. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified with the Probequant kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in Denhardt's, formamide 50%, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, and denatured salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed in 0.5× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min and subjected to autoradiography. SOCSs cDNA subcloned in pEF have been described previously (9.Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A.

The human insulin receptor cDNA was obtained from A. Ullrich (Max-Planck Institute, Martinsreid, Germany) and subcloned in pCDNA3. Human Stat5B cDNA subcloned in pSX was a kind gift from W.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.42-16.44Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 36 or 48 h after transfection. After appropriate treatment, cells were rinsed twice with Buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA), then scraped into Buffer B (Buffer A supplemented with 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). 0.75% Triton X-100 was added. Cells were vortexed for 10 s and spun for 2 min. Cytosolic extracts were used for immunoblotting.

After a 15-min spin, nuclear extracts were quantified for protein content. 10 μg of extract were diluted in 8 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm KCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1 μg/ul bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) Ficoll 0.04 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 mm spermidine, and 0.05 mg/ml salmon sperm for 15 min at 4 °C. The DNA binding assay was initiated by addition of 3 × 105 cpm of the DNA-labeled probe. After 30 min at 30 °C, samples were loaded on a 5% acrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. For β-casein, the sequence of the probe is AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAATCC. CTAAACATTACAAGAAGACCGGCC is the −102 to −79 sequence of the SOCS-3 promoter containing the −95 to −87 putative Stat binding element (in bold). GGGCAGTTCCAGGAATCGGGGGGC is the −78 to −55 sequence of the SOCS-3 promoter containing the −72 to −64 putative Stat binding element (in bold). p-Lex-IR, amino acids 944 to 1343 of the insulin receptor β -subunit, the various insulin receptor mutants, and the controls (pLex lamin, pAct-IRS1, and pAct-raf) were previously described (25.Tartare-Deckert S.

L40 yeast (MAT-a, trp1, leu2, his3, LYS2::lexA-HIS3, URA3::lexA-lacz) were grown at 30 °C in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media with 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose or in synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking the appropriate auxotrophic amino acids. Yeasts were transformed as described previously with the appropriate plasmids and plated in SC plates lacking tryptophan and leucine to select for the expression of pLex-9 and pAct-2 (25.Tartare-Deckert S.

After 48 h, double transformants were patched in SC plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine to test for histidine prototrophy. Other patches were performed in SC plates lacking leucine and tryptophan. After 2 days, the β-galactosidase assay was performed by a color filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as described previously (25.Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J.

COS-7 cells transfected with pCDNA3-HIR, HIRY960F, and pEF-SOCS-3 and grown on coverslips were stimulated or not with insulin, then placed on ice and washed three times with PBS. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and washed in PBS. Fixed samples were treated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min, washed, and permeabilized in Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) in PBS for 4 min. After 3 washes in PBS, samples were incubated with PBS supplemented with polyclonal antibodies to insulin receptor (1/300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal antibody to flag (1/300) (Sigma) for 30 min. Samples were then washed and incubated with either Texas red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1/500 in PBS) for 30 min. Samples were washed, and coverslips were mounted onto slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem) and viewed with a Leica upright confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Leica 63× Lens objective (numerical aperture, 1.0). The molecules were excited with the 600 line of an argon-krypton laser and imaged using a 488 (fluorescein isothiocyanate)- or 568 (Texas red)-nm bandpass filter. Images were acquired with a scanning mode format of 1024 by 1024. Serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with GH (96 nm) for 2 h or with insulin (100 nm) for 30 min, 2, or 6 h. At the end of the incubation, RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting using labeled probes for CIS, SOCS-2, or SOCS-3 (Fig. 1). Of all the SOCS tested, only SOCS-3 showed a detectable basal level. A 120-min growth hormone treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to an increase in the mRNA of CIS, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3. The effect of insulin on SOCS expression is different. Indeed, insulin did not modify the levels of CIS and SOCS-2 mRNA but induced SOCS-3 mRNA expression. This increase was barely detectable after 30 min but reached values 2.7 and 4 times above basal after 2 and 6 h of treatment, respectively. We (20.Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare D.S. Mothe I.

However, the genes induced by insulin in a Stat5B-dependent fashion are not known. We tested whetherSOCS-3 could be such a gene. As a first step, we verified that Stat5 was activated by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cells were treated or not with insulin, and thereafter, cytoplasm and nuclear extracts were isolated. EMSAs were performed using a previously characterized cDNA probe containing a Stat5 binding site present in the promoter of the β-casein gene. In parallel, Stat5B was immunoprecipitated, and its level of tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot with antibody to phosphotyrosine. As observed in Fig. 2, insulin activates Stat5B DNA binding activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as detected by a specific shift of the cDNA probe that is displaced by an excess of unlabeled probe. In parallel, insulin induces an increase in Stat5B tyrosine phosphorylation. These data indicate that insulin activates Stat5B in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We then tested if Stat5B was involved in the induction of SOCS-3 mRNA by insulin. To do so, we used COS-7 cells as a model system since they do not express detectable levels of endogenous Stat5B protein (27.Lin J.X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10738-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids coding for insulin receptor and with or without pSX-Stat5B. Cells were then treated or not for 2 h with insulin, RNA was extracted, and Northern analyses were performed using a cDNA probe for SOCS-3 (Fig. 3). In COS-7 cells expressing only the insulin receptor, insulin induces a weak increase in SOCS-3 mRNA (1.4-fold over basal). By comparison, in cells expressing both insulin receptor and Stat5B, insulin induces a 2.9-fold stimulation of SOCS-3 expression over basal. These data indicate that, in COS-7 cells, Stat5B enhances insulin-induced SOCS-3 transcription.Figure 3Stat5B-dependent induction of SOCS-3 by insulin. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with plasmid encoding the insulin receptor (IR) alone or with pSX-Stat5B were treated or not with 100 nm insulin (ins) for 2 h.

Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A sequence located at −99 to −60 has been found to be essential for LIF transactivation of this SOCS-3 promoter. This sequence contains two putative Stat elements (TT(N )5AA, where N is a nucleoside) found at −95 to −87 and at −72 to −64. We investigated whether insulin was able to induce an electrophoretic mobility shift of the cDNA probes corresponding to these two putative Stat binding sites and whether this shift was dependent upon Stat5B. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the insulin receptor and with or without pSX-Stat5B. Cells were treated or not with insulin for 15 or 30 min, and nuclear extracts were isolated. EMSA were performed using probes corresponding to the −95 to −87 or the −72 to −64 sequence of the SOCS-3 promoter (Fig.4). No insulin-stimulated electrophoretic shift was detected using the probe corresponding to the −95 to −87 sequence of the SOCS-3 promoter, whatever condition tested. However, an insulin-stimulated shift was observed when the −72 to −64 cDNA probe was used with nuclear extracts from cells expressing both the insulin receptor and Stat5B. This shift was specific since it disappears in the presence of an excess of unlabeled probe. The mobility shift was dependent upon Stat5B expression since no specific DNA binding activity was observed when nuclear extracts from cells expressing only the insulin receptor were utilized. These observations suggest that insulin induces SOCS-3 expression directly through Stat5B stimulation and binding of Stat5B to the SOCS-3 promoter. According to the emerging picture, the SOCS proteins are usually part of a negative feedback loop in which they inhibit activation of the Stats by cytokines. The insulin receptor is thought to directly activate Stat5B upon binding the transcription factor and phosphorylating it. Therefore, we were interested in examining the action of SOCS-3 on the stimulation of Stat5B by insulin. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the insulin receptor and Stat5B in the presence or absence of various doses of pEF-SOCS-3 (expressing an epitope-tagged flag-SOCS-3). Cells were stimulated for 15 min with insulin, and thereafter, cytoplasm and nuclear extracts were isolated. Western blots were performed to verify that the quantity of insulin receptor and Stat5B were equivalent in all conditions and that SOCS-3 was expressed (Fig. 5). We found that insulin induced a shift of the probe, which disappeared in the presence of an excess of unlabeled probe. Expression of SOCS-3 inhibited the activation of Stat5B by insulin in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by the decrease in the intensity of the specific shift. The inhibitory action of SOCS-3 on insulin stimulation of Stat5B could be due to a direct intervention of SOCS-3 on the receptor phosphorylation and kinase activity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of SOCS-3 expression on insulin receptor phosphorylation. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding insulin receptor in the presence or absence of SOCS-3. Cells were stimulated with insulin for 15 min and lysed. The expression level of insulin receptor and SOCS-3 was assessed by a Western blot using antibodies to insulin receptor or to the flag epitope. Insulin receptor was immunoprecipitated and revealed by Western blotting with antibody to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 6). As expected, insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor β-subunit. Although it was expressed (lower panel), SOCS-3 did not alter tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor, whose expression was identical in all conditions. These data indicate that the inhibition exerted by SOCS-3 on insulin-induced activation of Stat5B is not linked to an effect on insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. As SOCS-3 inhibited insulin-induced Stat5B activation without noticeable modification of insulin receptor kinase activity, we investigated whether SOCS-3 could bind to the insulin receptor at the same site as Stat5B does. We were not able to show co-immunoprecipitation of the insulin receptor and SOCS-3 using COS-7 cell extract (data not shown). This is not surprising considering previous reports. Indeed, direct interactions between insulin receptor and its bona fidepartners (such as IRS, Shc, and Stat) have been very difficult, if not impossible, to visualize using a co-immunoprecipitation approach. In contrast, alternative approaches such as the yeast two-hybrid system has been used with success (20.Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare D.S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J.

NPC1 has been shown to be a membrane glycoprotein that localizes to Lamp-positive organelles, presumably endosomes and lysosomes (16Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K.

Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Further studies have demonstrated that NPC1 resides primarily in late endosomes and only secondarily in lysosomes and the TGN (18Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This is an important distinction in view of recent data suggesting that cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells occurs primarily in endosomes (19Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.-H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which are sorting sites for various cellular components. In addition, NPC cells appear to be defective in their efflux of endocytosed sucrose and in the sorting of the mannose-6 phosphate receptor, suggesting that the retrograde movement of proteins and cargo from late endosomes to the TGN is perturbed (16Neufeld E.B.

Interestingly, although NPC1 is not closely related to any known proteins, a cluster of five potential membrane-spanning sequences, from residues 616 to 797, is homologous to the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) found in two key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, HMG-R and sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). In SCAP, a single point mutation in its SSD is sufficient to render the protein sterol-insensitive, indicating the importance of this region (20Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 21Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13709-13714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas in HMG-R the SSD mediates sterol-regulated degradation of the protein (22Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 1985; 260: 10271-10277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane (TM) regions of NPC1, including the putative SSD, also share homology with regions of Patched (PTC), a receptor for the cholesterol-activated protein sonic hedgehog (24Marigo V. Davey R.A. Zuo Y. Cunningham J.M. Tabin C.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 25Stone D.M. Hynes M. Armanini M. Swanson T.A. Gu Q. Johnson R.L. Scott M.P.

Together these data support the view that the SSD is functionally significant. In these studies we describe and validate a topological model for the structure of NPC1, showing that the orientation of the putative SSD is identical to those of HMG-R and SCAP. These data should support efforts in elucidating the precise function of this large membrane glycoprotein.

The plasmid constructs were named according to the last loop and TM domain in their cDNA sequences as follows: pLaTM1, pLbTM2, pLcTM3, pLdTM4, pLdTM6, and pLeTM13; and these encoded amino acids 1–296, 375, 549, 644, 727, and 1164, respectively (Fig. 2). An additional slightly truncated, FLAG-tagged protein was produced, as above, in which the carboxyl terminus tail after TM15 was completely replaced with a FLAG tag. This plasmid, pTM15tail, encoded NPC1 amino acids 1–1252. To assess the ability of the full-length FLAG-tagged NPC1 proteins to correct the NPC1 phenotype, human NPC1 fibroblasts (GM03123), obtained from Coriell cell repositories (Camden, NJ), were grown and transfected with the appropriate constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described previously (18Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). At 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced and the cells were grown for a further 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min, washed with PBS, and then quenched with blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 50 μg/ml filipin in PBS) containing 1.5 mg/ml glycine for 15 min. Cells were costained for cholesterol and the epitope-tagged NPC1 proteins by incubating with blocking solution that contained 2 μg/ml M2 anti-FLAG antibody for 45 min, washing 3 × 5 min with 50 μg/ml Filipin in PBS, and then incubating with blocking solution that contained 2 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine-X for 45 min. After further washing the cells were mounted and visualized as above. The expression and epitope accessibility of all FLAG-tagged proteins was assessed by transient transfection followed by selective permeabilization and immunofluorescence microscopy. COS-7 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown as described (18Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), were treated with colcemid for 18 h prior to electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser unit set at 500 microfarads and 250 V to transfect 10 μg of plasmid DNA into approximately 106cells. The cells were grown on glass coverslips that had been treated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine to reduce cell loss during subsequent selective permeabilization steps. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS. For complete permeabilization, cells were fixed in methanol for 6 min at 4 °C and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Proteins were detected by incubation with 5.2 μg/ml M2 anti-FLAG antibody and 1.4 μg/ml rabbit anti-α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) polyclonal antibody (27Ioannou Y.A. Zeidner K.M. Grace M.E. Desnick R.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in blocking solution for 45 min, followed by a wash with PBS, and then incubation with 2 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG-FITC and 2 μg/ml anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine-X secondary antibodies in blocking solution. After further washing, the cells were mounted in Fluoromount G and visualized using a Nikon Eclipse fluorescence microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Nikon, Melville, NY). To selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min in sucrose buffer (1% BSA, 0.3 msucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0, 1, 1.5, or 2 μg/ml digitonin and with the same concentrations of M2 FLAG and α-Gal A antibodies used for complete permeabilization. The cells were then fixed with methanol and incubated in blocking solution for 30 min before addition of secondary antibodies and visualization as above. For expression of various NPC1 constructs, COS-7 cells were grown in 10-cm diameter dishes and transfected using 4 μg of DNA, 20 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 30 μl of Plus reagent, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The transiently expressed proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), essentially as described previously (27Ioannou Y.A. Zeidner K.M. Grace M.E. Desnick R.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 36 h post-transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 16 h. Cells were harvested using PBS, 2 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 800 × gfor 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 25 μg/mlN-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal, 1 μm/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm Pefabloc), disrupted by sonication using a Branson sonifier (Smith-Klein, Philadelphia, PA), and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant cell membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal, supplemented with the above proteinase inhibitors, using 10 passages through a 22-gauge needle, prior to rocking for 15 min and centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 10 min. The solubilized membranes were incubated for 1 h with 2.8 μg/ml of anti-FLAG M2, followed by a 45-min incubation with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The immunoprecipitates were washed with buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.2% NaN3), resuspended in SDS-gel loading buffer, heated for 10 min at 65 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (28Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). N-Glycosidase F digestions were carried out as described previously (27Ioannou Y.A. Zeidner K.M. Grace M.E. Desnick R.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The predicted NPC1 protein sequence was analyzed to identify potential transmembrane (TM) or hydrophilic domains. Using the TMpred algorithm (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) at EMBnet-CH, the TM domains and topology of the hydrophilic loops of NPC1 were evaluated. The NPC1 protein is predicted to have 15 TM regions (Fig.1 A). The assignment of predicted TM regions 4–8 is based on their relative hydrophobicity and their high degree of similarity to the sterol-sensing domains of SCAP and HMG-R (30Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A, SSD). Based on these observations and computer analyses, the predicted model for NPC1 topology is shown in Fig. 1 Band consists of 15 TM domains, 5 hydrophilic loops ranging in size from ∼50 amino acids (loop B) to ∼265 amino acids (loop A), and a 27-amino acid cytoplasmic tail containing a potential endosomal/lysosomal dileucine targeting motif. In addition, the model predicts that the amino terminus of NPC1 (loop A) remains in the lumen upon entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To validate the locations of the major hydrophilic loops A to E in the predicted model (Fig. 1 B), a series of epitope-tagged, full-length NPC1 proteins was constructed and analyzed. These epitope-tagged NPC1 proteins were expressed in human NPC1 fibroblasts to determine whether the addition of the tags interfered with their correct processing, transport, and/or function. Transfected cells were costained with filipin and the anti-FLAG antibody to determine whether cells expressing the FLAG-tagged NPC1 were corrected for the NPC1 phenotype, thus producing filipin-negative cells. 50–100 NPC1-positive cells were scored for correction. For all constructs ∼60–90% of positive cells appeared to be corrected, with the exception of the loop C construct for which about 22% of cells were corrected. Representative fields for each construct are shown in Fig.3; human NPC1 cells positive for NPC1 expression (left panels; arrows) show a dramatic decrease in filipin staining (right panels;arrows) compared with neighboring cells, which are negative for NPC1 expression. Only one construct, which contained the tag in loop C (Fig. 3 C), did not appear to complement the NPC1 phenotype. Upon careful inspection it is clear that NPC1 containing the loop C tag does not colocalize with the stored cholesterol and thus is unable to mobilize cholesterol, similar to results obtained by mutagenesis of the NPC1 tail (32Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Glick J.M. Patel S. Neufeld E.B. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the FLAG-tagged NPC1 proteins are functional and, with the exception of the loop C construct, were correctly targeted to the endosomal/lysosomal system, the site of cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 cells. Thus, these epitope-tagged NPC1 proteins remained functionally active and could be used to determine the membrane topology of NPC1. The full-length FLAG-tagged NPC1 constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells following electroporation. Because COS-7 cells are easy to transfect and maintain, the majority of experiments were carried out using these cells. Initial studies showed no differences in the processing, distribution, and functional integrity of the expressed proteins, indicating that NPC1 is topologically identical whether expressed by human or simian cells (data not shown). To determine the positions of the hydrophilic domains, selective membrane permeabilization and immunofluorescence microscopy were used. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis under one of three conditions: no permeabilization (absence of detergent); selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane using low concentrations of digitonin; or full permeabilization by methanol fixation. All NPC1 proteins were detected with the M2 FLAG antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. As a control for permeabilization, the intralysosomal protein α-Gal A was detected using a specific polyclonal antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Pilot studies indicated that concentrations of digitonin below 3 μg/ml specifically permeabilized the plasma membrane but not intracellular membranes, as demonstrated by the inability of the α-Gal A antibody to detect its target protein within lysosomes (not shown). Under these conditions, cytosolic protein epitopes were detected while luminal ones, including the α-Gal A control protein, were negative. Nonpermeabilized cells were used as a negative control while transfection efficiency and locations of expressed proteins were analyzed in fully permeabilized cells. Fig. 4 shows the results of immunofluorescence detection of proteins from the FLAG-tagged constructs. Representative cells are shown for each condition. In fully permeabilized cells, a bright, vesicular staining pattern for the intraorganelle marker α-Gal A was observed, indicating complete antibody access. However, in digitonin-permeabilized cells there was no α-Gal A staining, confirming that permeabilization was selective for the plasma membrane. The six full-length NPC1 proteins, containing FLAG tags in domains A–E and the cytoplasmic tail, were analyzed (Fig. 4). Detection of the loop A-tagged NPC1 protein in the fully but not the partially permeabilized cells indicated that loop A was luminal. Similarly, detection of the loop B-tagged protein in digitonin-permeabilized cells, accompanied by a negative α-Gal A signal, indicated that this epitope, and thus loop B, was cytosolic (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the FLAG tags in loops C and D were both undetectable in digitonin-treated cells, suggesting their luminal location (Fig. 4, C and D). These results indicated that the orientation of loops D and E was reversed with respect to our predicted model, implying that the predicted TM3 domain does not span the membrane. This suggests that loops C and D comprise a single luminal loop and loop E is shifted from a cytoplasmic position to the luminal one. The results for loop E confirmed its luminal location, assuming elimination of TM3. However, its distribution was surprising. This protein was detected in large quantities at the plasma membrane of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 4 E). Interestingly, the membrane staining appeared speckled and uneven, perhaps indicating that some form of aggregation occurred at the cell surface. However, this phenomenon does not apparently interfere with NPC1 function, because the protein successfully reversed the cholesterol storage observed in filipin-stained human fibroblasts (Fig. 3 E). The mechanism by which a FLAG tag in this luminal loop causes mislocalization of NPC1 to the plasma membrane is currently being investigated. To further confirm the location of loop E, two different approaches were used. First, an additional construct containing the FLAG tag at a different position within loop E was expressed and analyzed as above. The expressed protein did not mislocalize to the plasma membrane. As shown in Fig. 4 F, failure to detect the FLAG-tagged protein in digitonin-treated cells confirmed the previous conclusion that loop E is luminal. Second, an antibody directed against loop E was used to detect its epitope in permeabilized cells that expressed wt NPC1, as above, lending further support to the luminal location of loop E (data not shown). Notably, the above results indicate that elimination of TM3 from our topological model reverses the orientation of the SSD. In this orientation, the amino terminus of the SSD i"

In addition, mutagenesis experiments have implicated a motif (QLS) in helix 7 in determining the sugar recognition of GLUT1–GLUT5 (16.Seatter M.J. De la Rue S.A. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The known glucose transporter (GLUT)1 isoforms differ in their expression in different tissues, in their kinetic characteristics, i.e. K m values (2.Mueckler M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 6-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in their substrate specificity. GLUT1 mediates glucose transport into erythrocytes and through the blood-brain barrier, and appears to provide a basal supply of glucose for most cells. GLUT2 catalyzes glucose uptake into the liver (17.Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and is an essential component of the glucose sensing mechanism of the pancreatic β cell (18.Guillam M.T. Hummler E.

GLUT3 is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells (19.Gould G.W. Brant A.M. Kahn B.B. Shepherd P.R. McCoid S.C. Gibbs E.M. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas GLUT4 is exclusively found in muscle and adipose tissue (20.James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M.

GLUT5 mediates transport of fructose, but probably not glucose, in intestine and spermatozoa (24.Burant C.F. Takeda J. Brot-Laroche E. Bell G.I. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse tissue distribution and the specific functions of GLUT1–GLUT5 appear to indicate that these genes are sufficient to control glucose uptake in all mammalian tissues. However, two arguments may be raised that suggest the possibility that additional sugar transport facilitators exist. First, in some tissues, only low levels of mRNA of the known isoforms were detected (25.Kayano T. Burant C.F. Fukumoto H. Gould G.W. Fan Y.S. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13276-13282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, GLUT4 knockout mice exhibited an almost normal glucose transport in muscle, although no compensatory increase of the GLUT1 or GLUT3 gene expression was detected (26.Katz E.B. Stenbit A.E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to identify additional hexose transporters, we conducted a search of the EST data bases taking advantage of the conserved “sugar transporter signatures.” This search led to the identification of several novel GLUT-like genes. Here we describe the identification and characterization of GLUT8, a novel sugar transporter with unusual structural features and tissue-specific gene expression. Tissues were homogenized in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, and total RNA was isolated by centrifugation on a cesium chloride cushion (5.88 m) at 33,000 rpm (rotor SW40) for 22 h. 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed with a kit from Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Primers for cDNA synthesis and the first amplifications were derived from the sequence of the IMAGE clone 46121. DNA fragments were isolated and subcloned into pUC18 with the SureCloneR kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Since the first RACE amplification yielded fragments still lacking the 5′ end of the cDNA, a second and third amplification was performed on the basis of the sequence information obtained in the previous RACE procedures. All cDNA clones and PCR products were sequenced in both directions by the method of Sanger (ThermoSequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) with the aid of an automated sequencer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Samples of total RNA (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). Blots generated with RNA from different human tissues were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Probes were generated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming (27.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). The nylon membranes were hybridized at 42 °C and washed two times at 55 °C with 0.12 m NaCl, 0.012 m sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS. A fragment of the GLUT8 cDNA comprising the 5′-untranslated region and the full reading frame was amplified by PCR and was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV, which harbors an SV40 origin, a cytomegalovirus promoter, and a polyadenylation site. GLUT4 cDNA (21.Birnbaum M.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the same expression vector as described (28.Schürmann A. Monden I.

Cells transfected with glucose transporter cDNA were homogenized and fractionated as described previously (28.Schürmann A. Monden I. Joost H.-G. Keller K. Biochim. Biophys.

For detection of GLUT8 in the membrane fractions (plasma membranes, 13,000 ×g; high density microsomes, 45,000 × g; low density microsomes, 200,000 × g), antiserum against a C-terminal peptide (sequence in single-letter code: KGRTLEQVTAHFEGR) was used. Equilibrium cytochalasin B binding in plasma membranes from transfected cells was assayed by a method established with fat cell membranes (31.Weber T.M. Joost H.-G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W.

Biochem. 1982; 122: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35.Schürmann A. Rosenthal W. Hinsch K.D. Joost H.-G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Initial uptake rates ofd-[U-14C]glucose were assayed after 10 s at a substrate concentration of 1 mm. The data were corrected for non-carrier-mediated uptake with tracerl-[3H]glucose. In order to identify unknown glucose transporter-like sequences, we performed a search of the EST data bases with the protein sequences of the known GLUT isoforms (tblastx program). A total of approximately 200 EST sequences found in this search were further analyzed by individual comparisons. Among these, several human and murine EST sequences exhibited significant similarity with the GLUT family but differed from the known GLUT-isoforms. By sequencing a clone obtained from the IMAGE consortium (clone no. 46121, EST HS414155) we generated a partial cDNA sequence of a glucose transporter-like protein; this sequence exhibited significant similarity with a portion of the GLUT1 comprising membrane-spanning helices 5–12. Screening of several cDNA libraries failed to isolate longer clones. Thus, the sequence information of the missing 5′ portion was obtained by three sequential 5′-RACE amplifications with cDNA from human testis. Similarly, the mouse cDNA sequence was obtained by sequencing of a partial IMAGE clone (clone 1178770, EST AA734465) and subsequent RACE-PCR. Additional data base searches with the GLUT8 cDNA led to the identification of a human EST (STS A005N15/HSG20347) for which genomic localization has been determined by radiation hybrid mapping. This sequence tag is identical with the 3′ end of 12 independent GLUT8 cDNA clones. Thus, it can be concluded that the sequence tag maps the genomic localization of GLUT8 to chromosome 9. The cDNAs of both mouse and human GLUT8 contain open reading frames encoding a sequence of 477 amino acids (Fig. 1). Within the coding region, 85.2% of the nucleotides and 86.2% of the amino acids are identical. The deduced amino acid sequence of human GLUT8 is 29.4% identical with that of the GLUT1 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, 73 (55%) of the 132 residues that are identical in all mammalian GLUT isoforms (marked by asterisks in Fig. 1) are conserved in GLUT8. Analysis of the sequence with the HELIXMEM program suggested the presence of 12 putative membrane-spanning helices, consistent with the presumed tertiary structure of a transport facilitator (Fig.2). The sequence contains all motifs (sugar transporter signatures) that are characteristic for the family of sugar transporters, in particular two motifs similar to the PESPR/PETKGR motifs following helices 6 and 12 (Fig. 2). Additionally, motifs corresponding with the GRR motifs in loops 2 and 8, and glutamate and arginine residues in the intracellular loops 4 and 10 are present in GLUT8. Furthermore, tryptophan residues corresponding with Trp388 and Trp412 in GLUT1 are present; Trp412 has been implicated in the binding of the transport inhibitor cytochalasin B. There are striking differences from GLUT1. Loop 1 is much shorter than that of GLUT1 and lacks a glycosylation site; instead, the glycosylation site appears to be located in the larger loop 9. Furthermore, the conserved STS motif in loop 7 is replaced by AET.Figure 2Putative membrane topology of GLUT8 and sequences of its sugar transporter signatures. The model is based on structural predictions obtained with the HELIXMEM program, and is drawn according to that introduced by Mueckler et al. (1.Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Only residues of GLUT8 that correspond with the sugar transporter signatures (determined by sequence comparisons of GLUT1–GLUT5) are highlighted. Dark background marks substitutions of these residues within the GLUT8 sequence. The figure depicts a presumed glycosylation site in loop 9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 illustrates a dendrogram of an alignment of GLUT8 with its closest relatives. The protein with the highest similarity is another novel transport facilitator (GLUT9, 43.6% identical amino acids), which was recently cloned by our group. 2H. Doege and H.-G. Joost, unpublished data. The next relatives are the mammalian glucose transporters (GLUT1; 29.4% identical residues), the Saccharomyces pombe inositol transporter (30.2% identical residues), and the Escherichia coliarabinose and xylose transporters (32.8% and 29.1% identical amino acids, respectively). Individual alignments of these sequences (PALIGN program) also indicated that the similarity of GLUT8 with the arabinose transporter (155 identical amino acids) is somewhat higher than that of the arabinose transporter with the GLUT1 (140 amino acids). Thus, GLUT8 may be more closely related with a common evolutionary precursor of the sugar transporter family than the GLUT isoforms. The mouse GLUT8 cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, and COS-7 cells were transfected with this construct. Plasma membranes from transfected cells were isolated by differential centrifugation and were incubated with [3H]cytochalasin B and different concentrations of unlabeled ligand. As is illustrated in Fig.4, overexpression of GLUT8 protein caused a marked increase in specific binding of cytochalasin B. The meanKD derived from Scatchard plots of the binding curves (data not shown) was 56.6 ± 18 nm (three independent transfections) and is well within the range ofKD values assayed for binding of cytochalasin B to members of the GLUT family (22.Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Hellwig B. Joost H.-G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 383-389PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochalasin B binding to GLUT8 is fully inhibitable by glucose with an EC50 of approximately 50 mm. Plasma membranes from cells transfected with GLUT8 cDNA were solubilized, and proteins were reconstituted into lecithin liposomes for assay of their glucose transport activity. As is illustrated in Fig.5 (upper panel), transfection with GLUT8 cDNA produced an 8-fold increase ind-glucose transport activity as compared with membranes from cells transfected with blank vector. Transfection with GLUT4 cDNA produced a somewhat lower increase. Note, however, that this difference appeared to reflect a lower abundance of GLUT4 in the reconstituted membranes, since normalization of transport rates for cytochalasin B bound (tracer only) indicated a somewhat lower activity of GLUT8 (392 ± 113 pmol of glucose/pmol of cytochalasin Bversus 810 ± 228 in membranes with GLUT4). In order to obtain an additional comparison of the glucose transport activities of GLUT4 and GLUT8, membranes were prepared from transfected cells on a larger scale allowing a full Scatchard analysis of the number of cytochalasin B binding sites. In this experiment, GLUT8 transported 4.1 mol of glucose/mol of cytochalasin B, as compared with 5.2 transported by GLUT4. In order to ascertain the expression of GLUT8 with a second, independent method, Western blots of the membrane fractions were analyzed with antiserum against a C-terminal peptide. As is illustrated in the lower panel of Fig. 5, cells transfected with the GLUT8 cDNA indeed expressed a protein with a somewhat lower apparent molecular mass (42 kDa) than that of the GLUT4 (45 kDa); no immunoreactivity was found in cells transfected with bland vector. A second specific band was detected at approximately 75 kDa. Since glucose transporters tend to aggregate even under denaturing conditions, this band might represent a homodimer of GLUT8. By Northern blot analysis (Fig.6), a 2.4-kilobase pair transcript corresponding with GLUT8 mRNA (size calculated from the sequence: 1.92 kilobase pairs) was predominantly found in testis; lower amounts were detected in most other tissues investigated, e.g.spleen, prostate, small intestine, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Because of the predominant expression of the GLUT8 in testis, we investigated its expression in testicular carcinoma and in testicular tissue from patients treated with estrogen. As is illustrated in Fig.7, GLUT8 mRNA was not detectable in samples from two patients with testicular carcinoma. Furthermore, estrogen treatment fully suppressed the expression of GLUT8 in testis.Figure 7. Hormonal regulation of GLUT8 expression in testis. Left panel, mRNA isolated from the indicated samples of human testis (normal testis, carcinoma, estrogen) was separated, blotted, and hybridized with human GLUT8 cDNA.Right panel, mRNA isolated from testis of prepubertal (2 weeks), pubertal (8 weeks), and adult rats (16 weeks) was separated, blotted, and hybridized with mouse GLUT8 cDNA. Loading of RNA was controlled by ethidium bromide staining (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of the Northern blots suggested that GLUT8 is associated with male germ cells, and that its expression is controlled by gonadotropins. Therefore, we studied the mRNA levels in testis from rats of different age. As is illustrated in Fig. 7 (right panel), the 2.4-kilobase pair transcript was found in testis from adult and pubertal, but not in prepubertal rats. The novel transporter protein is a close relative of the glucose transport facilitators GLUT1–GLUT4 and shares their ability to catalyze the diffusion of glucose in a system of reconstituted membranes, and their ability to bind the specific ligand cytochalasin B in a glucose-inhibitable manner. Its sequence presents all elements (sugar transporter signatures) that are characteristic for the GLUT family and are required for their function as hexose transporters (9.Schürmann A. Doege H. Ohnimus H. Monser V. Buchs A. Joost H.-G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12897-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,29.Doege H. Schürmann A. Ohnimus H. Monser V. Holman G.D. Joost H.-G. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein is a novel member of the family of sugar transport facilitators and was designated GLUT8. However, its similarity with the GLUT isoforms is not higher than that with theE. coli arabinose and xylose transporter and with that of the S. pombe inositol transporter. Together with a second novel transport facilitator,2 it is located on a separate branch within the family of hexose transporters. On the basis of the sequence comparison between GLUT8 and the GLUT family, we expected the protein to bind cytochalasin B with high affinity in a glucose-inhibitable manner. The findings presented here confirm this assumption and suggest that binding of this ligand requires the presence of few of the sugar transporter signatures,e.g. tryptophan 418. In addition to glucose-inhibitable cytochalasin B binding, GLUT8 exhibited a reconstitutable glucose transport activity similar to that of the GLUT4. This finding was unexpected, because we assumed that the substrate recognition required a higher similarity with the GLUT1–GLUT5 isoforms. In particular, GLUT8 harbors a motif in the outer loop 7 (AET) that markedly differs from that of the glucose transporters GLUT1–GLUT4 (STS). Previous mutagenesis studies from our group had indicated that these residues are crucial for the conformational alterations during the transport process (29.Doege H. Schürmann A. Ohnimus H. Monser V. Holman G.D. Joost H.-G. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the striking conservation of this motif among GLUT1–GLUT4 suggested that the residues in this outer loop might define the glucose specificity of these transporters. However, the present data strongly argue against a role of the STS motif in determining the sugar specificity of the GLUT family. Rather, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that it is the QLS motif in helix 7 (residues 283–285 in GLUT8) that determines d-glucose specificity of a GLUT isoform (19.Gould G.W. Brant A.M. Kahn B.B. Shepherd P.R. McCoid S.C. Gibbs E.M. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the possibility cannot be excluded that GLUT8 also transports other sugars, and future studies are needed to define the substrate specificity of this sugar transport facilitator. The tissue distribution of mRNA of GLUT8 suggests that it is widely expressed in different glucose metabolizing tissues such as testis, muscle, brain, liver, and kidney. Thus, it is conceivable that GLUT8 is the unknown glucose transporter that has been postulated to compensate the lack of GLUT4 in GLUT4 knockout mice (26.Katz E.B. Stenbit A.E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, highest mRNA levels were detected in testis, and it appears reasonable to assume that this expression reflects a testis-specific function. Accordingly, GLUT8 was expressed in testis from adult, but not from prepubertal, rats. Furthermore, we observed that the human testicular expression is markedly inhibited by estrogen treatment, which is known to suppress gonadotropin secretion (37.Gooren L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, the results are consistent with a hormonal regulation of the GLUT8 expression by gonadotropins and/or a dependence on spermatogenesis. Thus, GLUT8 might be involved in the provision of glucose required for DNA synthesis in male germ cells. After submission of this manuscript, a glucose transporter cDNA (GLUTX1) was described (Ibberson, M., Uldry, M., and Thorens, B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275,4607–4612), which is essentially identical with that of GLUT8. The cDNA sequences of human GLUT8 and human GLUTX1 differ in 5 nucleotides; 2 of these alter the amino acid sequence (S376N, S457F). The cDNA sequences of mouse GLUT8 and GLUTX1 differ in 4 nucleotides resulting in the alteration of 3 amino acids (S39N, A94S, S429N). We thank S. Detro-Dassen for technical assistance, Dr. S. Jacobs for mRNA preparations and Northern blots, and Dr. W. Becker for critically reading the manuscript."

A critical question regarding the role(s) of these proteases is whether selective inhibition of an effector caspase(s) will prevent cell death. We have identified potent and selective non-peptide inhibitors of the effector caspases 3 and 7. The inhibition of apoptosis and maintenance of cell functionality with a caspase 3/7-selective inhibitor is demonstrated for the first time, and suggests that targeting these two caspases alone is sufficient for blocking apoptosis. Furthermore, an x-ray co-crystal structure of the complex between recombinant human caspase 3 and an isatin sulfonamide inhibitor has been solved to 2.8-Å resolution. In contrast to previously reported peptide-based caspase inhibitors, the isatin sulfonamides derive their selectivity for caspases 3 and 7 by interacting primarily with the S2 subsite, and do not bind in the caspase primary aspartic acid binding pocket (S1). These inhibitors blocked apoptosis in murine bone marrow neutrophils and human chondrocytes. Furthermore, in camptothecin-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, cell functionality as measured by type II collagen promoter activity is maintained, an activity considered essential for cartilage homeostasis.

Caspase-null mutants have been used to demonstrate the importance of individual family members in murine embryonic development, and cells derived from these caspase-deficient mice have allowed the association of individual caspases with specific morphological changes that occur during apoptosis (4.Kuida K.

However, because these animals either diein utero or possess short life spans, their utility in the development of relevant disease models is severely compromised. The involvement of caspase(s) in apoptosis is more frequently characterized in vitro by measuring enzyme activities and evaluating the effects of inhibitors in cell lysates and tissue extracts. Cell-based studies have been performed using peptide inhibitors with limited cell permeabilities, irreversible peptide inhibitors, and prodrug peptide inhibitors (9.Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Tilly J.L. When Cells Die. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 177-210Google Scholar, 10.Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The moderate caspase selectivities associated with these reagents have made it difficult to assess the importance of a specific caspase in apoptosis, and the interpretation of results is often ambiguous. Caspase 3 has been found to be activated in virtually every model of apoptosis (12.Porter A.G. Janicke R.U. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar). It belongs to a subfamily of effector caspases, which also includes caspases 6 and 7. These caspases are activated downstream of initiator caspases such as 8 and 10. Natural substrates of caspase 3 include many proteins involved in cell maintenance and/or repair (13.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). For example, oligonucleosome fragmentation (DNA laddering) is a characteristic feature of apoptosis and is mediated by caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD),1 whose activation is effected by the caspase 3-mediated cleavage of the CAD inhibitor ICAD (14.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). The availability of a selective inhibitor of caspase 3 would allow the evaluation of the potential for inhibition of apoptosis at the level of an effector caspase. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease histologically characterized by the erosion of articular cartilage and is a potential candidate for an anti-apoptotic therapeutic agent. Chondrocytes are the only cell type found in cartilage and are specific to this tissue. Elevated levels of apoptosis have been reported in superficial, mid-zone, and hypertrophic chondrocytes in OA cartilage (15.Blanco F.J. Guitan R. Vasquez-Martul E. Toror F.J. Galdo F. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 16.Hashimoto S. Ochs R.L. Komiya S. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition, chondrocytes adjacent to OA lesions express high levels ofbcl-2, a gene involved in the inhibition of apoptosis (17.Erlacher L. Maier R. Ullrich R. Keiner R. Aringer M. Menschik M. Graninger W. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar). Cartilage degradation appears to result from cleavage of matrix proteins by proteolytic enzymes derived from chondrocytes and/or synoviocytes. As OA progresses, the fibrillar collagen network is degraded and chondrocyte cell death increases (18.Hatori M. Klatte K.J. Teixeira C.C. Shapiro I.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19.Hollander A.P. Pidoux I. Reiner A. Rorabeck C. Bourne R. Poole A.R. J. Clin.

In several transgenic models, dysregulated apoptosis has been observed in chondrocytes associated with major structural and developmental abnormalities, thereby suggesting a critical role for the regulation of this process in articular cartilage (22.Karaplis A.C. Vautour L. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1997; 6: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J.

Cell Res. 1997; 235: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Increased numbers of apoptotic chondrocytes have also been observed in animal models with surgically induced OA (25.Hashimoto S. Takahashi S. Amiel D. Coutts R.D. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Therefore, the evidence suggesting a role for apoptosis in chondrocytes from normal cartilage is both extensive and convincing. Furthermore, during the development of OA, it has become evident that apoptotic events are dysregulated. We have identified potent and selective inhibitors of effector caspases 3 and 7 and have evaluated their potential to inhibit apoptosis in two cell-based models. In addition, the caspase 3/7-selective inhibitors blocked apoptosis in an in vitro osteoarthritis model and demonstrated for the first time that caspase 3/7 activity alone is critical in chondrocyte apoptosis and that our inhibitors may lead ultimately to a novel therapeutic strategy. In addition, the compounds inhibited apoptosis in mouse bone marrow neutrophils, which have previously been shown to be dependent upon caspase 3 for apoptosis (5.Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian D.K. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that inhibition of caspase 3 and/or 7 is essential for the apoptosis of multiple cell types and that inhibition of this activity may represent a novel approach for the treatment of diseases characterized by excessive apoptosis, such as OA. 1-Methyl-5-nitroisatin is commercially available from Aldrich. Sodium 5-isatinsulfonate (Aldrich) was treated with phosphorus oxychloride in sulfalane at 80 °C to yield 5-chlorosulfonylisatin (26.Martinez F. Naarmann H. Synth. Met. 1990; 39: 195-203Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Treatment of 5-chlorosulfonylisatin in tetrahydrofuran with an equivalent of amine in the presence of one equivalent of diisopropylethylamine yielded the 5-dialkylaminosulfonylisatin. 5-Dialkylaminosulfonylisatin was alkylated by treatment with sodium hydride in dimethylformamide (27.Von Tacconi G. Righetti P.P. Desimoni G. J. Prakt. Chem. 1973; 315: 339-344Crossref Google Scholar) and reacting the resulting salt with an alkyl halide at temperatures ranging from 25 to 80 °C to give 1-alkyl-5-alkylaminosulfonylisatin. All compounds were characterized by satisfactory proton NMR and mass spectrometry data. Caspase 9 was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). The DNA sequences encoding the caspase 3, 4, and 8 catalytic domains (no prodomain) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from their respective full-length human caspase cDNAs using custom synthetic oligonucleotide primers and cloned into an Escherichia coliexpression vector. The DNA sequences for an N-terminal hexa-His tag and factor Xa cleavage site were designed into the forward primers, and restriction sites were incorporated into the forward and reverse primers for cloning into the pet16b expression vector (Novagen), which was digested with restriction enzymes NcoI andXhoI (New England Biolabs). The amplified caspase DNA's cloned into pet16b were sequenced to verify correct DNA sequences. The clones were then transformed into E. coli expression host LW29(DE3), a derivative of BL21(DE3) containing a chromosomal LacIQ. 2SmithKline Beecham, unpublished data. Single transformants were grown up overnight at 37 °C in LB ampicillin (100 μg/ml) in shake flasks. The overnight cultures were diluted 1/30 into fresh media and allowed to grow to an A 600 of 0.8–1.0 before inducing with a final concentration of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cultures were induced for 3–4 h and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were frozen and stored at −70 °C. For purification, the frozen cells, ∼300 g of E. colicells harvested from a 10L bioreactor, were thawed and lysed in 1.5 liters of Buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.5m NaCl. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, which had previously been equilibrated with Buffer A. N-terminal His-tagged caspases were eluted with 300 mm imidazole in Buffer A. The eluate was dialyzed against Buffer A to remove the imidazole and salt and applied to a ToyoPearl DEAE-650M column. Caspases were eluted with a linear salt gradient, 0–500 mm NaCl, in Buffer A. A typical yield was ∼300 mg of each caspase. Purified proteins were characterized by N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, which confirmed that each caspase was composed of equal molar of p20 and p10 subunits, and molecular weights were as expected from the cDNA sequence. For caspases 2, 6, and 7, the full-length DNA sequences containing an N-terminal hexa-His tag were cloned and expressed in E. colias described above. After lysis of the cells, the presence of proteolytically processed enzyme was detected in the supernatant by Western blot with polyclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal peptide of each p20 subunit. The supernatant was applied to a ToyoPearl DEAE 650 m column and the active catalytic domain (p10/p20 complex) was eluted with a salt gradient as described above. Partially purified p10/p20 complex of each caspase was used for compound screening assays without further purification. For caspase 1, the N-terminal hexa-His-tagged proenzyme, which was expressed as an insoluble pellet, was solubilized in 8 m urea in buffer B (50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) and applied to an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Procaspase 1 was refolded in the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column by washing the column with Buffer B and eluted with 300 mm imidazole in Buffer B. The proenzyme was desalted using a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with Buffer A and adjusted to 5 mmdithiothreitol. Activation of proenzyme to p10/p20 complex was achieved by concentrating to 4 mg/ml and incubating 2 days at 4 °C. The activated protein mixture was further fractionated using Superdex 200. Fractions containing caspase 1 activity were pooled. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the active enzyme was >90% pure. Enzyme assays were run in 200-μl volumes and contained the following: 25 mmK+HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), and 10 μmAc-YVAD-AMC (caspase 1); 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.2, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-ME, and 25 μm Ac-VDVAD-AMC (caspase 2); 25 mmK+HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% CHAPS, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm β-ME, and 10 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC (caspases 3 and 7); 25 mm KOAc, pH 5.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm β-ME, and 100 μmAc-LEED-AMC (caspase 4); 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-ME, and 10 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC (caspase 6); Na+MOPS, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-ME, and 10 μm Ac-IETD-AMC (caspase 8); or 100 mm Na+MES, pH 6.5–10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm β-ME, and 10 μm Ac-LEHD-AFC (caspase 9). Recombinant caspases were diluted into the appropriate buffer to about 10 units/assay (1 units = 1 pmol of AMC product formed/min) and were added to the above incubation mixtures. All inhibitors tested were diluted into Me2SO prior to addition to the assay mixture; the final Me2SO concentration was 5%. Accumulation of AMC was measured at 30 °C with a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescent plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Co-crystals of the complex between recombinant human caspase 3 and inhibitor 4 were grown from 4-μl hanging drops formed by mixing equal volumes of protein (10 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) and reservoir solution. The drops equilibrated at room temperature (21 °C) through the vapor phase against 500 μl of a reservoir solution that contained 15–18% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.9, 20 mm l-cysteine, and 5% glycerol. The crystals belong to the space group I222 with unit cell dimensions,a = 67.2 Å, b = 83.3 Å,c = 96.0 Å. Diffraction data were collected at the X12B beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) from a single flash-frozen crystal with its largest dimension of less than ≈20 μm. The structure of the caspase 3 + inhibitor 4 complex was determined by difference Fourier using the coordinates of the isomorphous caspase 3 complex with Ac-DEVD-dimethylbenzoate previously determined and refined to 2.0 Å (data not shown). Initially, the difference electron density maps showed a 3ς peak in the active site. The interpretation of the map was aided by assuming a proposed mode of inhibition in which the thiolate group of Cys163 is covalently linked to C-3 of the inhibitor and the crystal structure of epi-5. The model was refined in X-PLOR (28.Brünger T.A. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar, 29.Brünger T.A.

The model of the asymmetric unit includes residues 29–173 and 185–277 of caspase 3, 45 water molecules, and the inhibitor molecule4. Mouse bone marrow cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), penicillin (10 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 ng/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 5-ml round-bottomed polypropylene tubes for 3 h at 37 °C; inhibitors were added at the same time as CHX. Approximately half of the cells were used for evaluation of neutrophil viability by FACS analysis, and the remainder was used for a DNA ladder assay as described previously (8.Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C.M. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). To determine neutrophil viability following CHX treatment, cells were washed and stained with anti-Gr-1-fluorescein isothiocyanate (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. This procedure was used also to assess propidium iodide staining of chondrocytes. Samples were analyzed by FACS. For the DNA ladder assay, DNA released into the cytoplasm was extracted, run on a 1% agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide (8.Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A.

Bovine chondrocytes were isolated from the articular cartilage of histologically normal carpal metacarpal joints of calves (0–3 months of age). Chondrocytes were isolated by sequential enzyme digestion as follows. Cartilage (2 joints) was incubated in 50 ml of 0.2% testicular hyaluronidase (type I-S from bovine testes) in DMEM without serum for 20 min at 37 °C. The hyaluronidase was then removed, and the tissue was incubated in 50 ml of 0.25% Pronase E in DMEM without serum for 20 min at 37 °C. The Pronase E was removed, and the cartilage was then incubated with 0.2% Clostridium histolyticum collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in DMEM plus 10% FBS overnight at 37 °C. The digested tissue was filtered through a 100-μm cell filter (Falcon), and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1200 × g for 10 min). The primary bovine chondrocytes were grown routinely in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented as above plus antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were subcultured using trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human chondrocyte cells (C20/A4) (31.Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.-F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) or primary bovine chondrocytes were grown in 24-well plates at 20,000 cells/well overnight and then treated with either camptothecin alone (4 μg/ml) (Biomol) or camptothecin (4 μg/ml) and Z-VAD-FMK (50 μm) or isatin sulfonamides for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared by combining the cells from the monolayer with the cells, which detached during the treatment period. Cells floating in the media were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g, resuspended in the manufacturer's lysis buffer, and then added back to the monolayer, and the total cell population was brought to 500 μl with lysis buffer. The samples were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g to clarify the lysates. Samples were evaluated for mono- and oligonucleosome DNA fragment formation in the cell death ELISA following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Human chondrocyte cells (C20/A4) (31.Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.-F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin.

Fukuo K. Birkhead J.R. Dudek E. Sandell L.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) of the type II collagen (COL2A1) gene is driving a luciferase reporter gene. To prepare the expression vector, the neomycin-resistant gene (NEOr) was inserted at the BamHI site of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). The 4.0-kb COL2A1 fragment was inserted at theXhoI/MluI sites and transfected into the C20/A4 cells and primary bovine chondrocytes using the calcium phosphate transfection method (Invitrogen). For stable cell line generation, cells were grown overnight in 10-cm dishes at 1 × 106cells/dish and transfected with 20 μg of pGL3-Basic-NEOr-COL2A1. Single clones were selected by growth in Geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 400 μg/ml for 2–3 weeks. Positive cells grown from single clones were maintained in media containing 200 μg/ml G418. Transiently transfected primary bovine cells and stably transfected C20A/4 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 25,000 cells/well overnight and then treated with either camptothecin alone (4 μg/ml) or camptothecin (4 μg/ml) with Z-VAD-FMK (50 μm) or isatin sulfonamides for 8 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 100 μl/well of the manufacturer's lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min while rocking at room temperature. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 × g, and the clear lysate was transferred to a new tube prior to reporter analysis. Samples (20 μl) were transferred to a 96-well luminescence detection plate and reacted with 100 μl of the luciferase assay reagent (Promega), which was injected by a Microlumat LB96P luminometer (Wallac) in order to measure luciferase activity. For each parameter, differences between groups were assessed by unpaired Student's t test using Excel (Microsoft Corp.). Differences with a value ofp < 0.05 were considered significant. High throughput screening for inhibitors of recombinant human caspase 3 resulted in the identification of 5-nitroisatin (1, Fig. 1), which inhibited the enzyme with a K i(app) of 0.5 μm (Table I). The potency of this compound and the non-peptidic nature of its structure made it an attractive starting point for a drug discovery effort.Table IInhibitor selectivity of the isatin sulfonamidesInhibitorK i(app)aThe K i(app)(μm was calculated from the estimated IC50 using the following equation assuming competitive inhibition, which is characteristic for this class of compounds, Ki( app ) = IC50/(1 + [S]/KS), where [ S ] is the concentration of the substrate in the assay and KS is the Michaelis constant of the substrate.Caspase 1Caspase 2Caspase 3Caspase 4Caspase 6Caspase 7Caspase 8Caspase 9μm112>500.504.01.70.29>502129.0>501.4>50>503.0>50223>25>250.060>25>250.17>253.14174.90.01533290.047490.465>501112>505710>50>50Inhibitor studies were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a The K i(app)(μm was calculated from the estimated IC50 using the following equation assuming competitive inhibition, which is characteristic for this class of compounds, Ki( app ) = IC50/(1 + [S]/KS), where [ S ] is the concentration of the substrate in the assay and KS is the Michaelis constant of the substrate.

Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), an initial binding hypothesis was developed. Our model was based on the assumption that a tetrahedral intermediate between the catalytic cysteine residue and the ketone carbonyl group of inhibitor1 is formed (34.Webber S.E. Tikhe J. Worland S.T. Fuhrman S.A. Hendrickson T.F. Matthews D.A. Love R.A. Patick A.K. Meador J.W. Ferre R.A. Brown E.L. DeLisle D.M. Ford C.E. Binford S.L. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 5072-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The mode of binding suggested that extension of the molecule from the 5-position would allow access to the S2-S4 (35.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) regions of the active site. In addition, there are metabolic stability issues associated with nitroaromatics. Therefore, a chemical functionality that would allow for the facile incorporation of chemical diversity was sought as a replacement for the 5-nitro group (36.Parkinson A. Klaassen C.D. Casarett and Doull's Toxicology. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 120-121Google Scholar). Evaluation of a series of groups resulted in the identification of isatin sulfonamide2, which retained significant activity against caspase 3 (K i(app) = 1.4 μm). Relative to lead 1, isatin sulfonamide 2 possessed much improved selectivity for caspases 1, 3, and 7 (Table I). Preparation of an extensive series of compounds with variation of groups about the sulfonamide functionality and isatin nitrogen culminated in the identification of isatin sulfonamides 3 and 4, 60 and 15 nm inhibitors of caspase 3, respectively. In addition, these inhibitors exhibited 100-fold or greater selectivity for the highly homologous caspases 3 and 7 (13.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) versus all other family members except caspase 9. Against this caspase, the selectivity ranged from 10- to 50-fold.

https://openalex.org/W2080144763,"The angiogenic inducer Cyr61 is an extracellular matrix-associated heparin-binding protein that can mediate cell adhesion, stimulate cell migration, and enhance growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis in both fibroblasts and endothelial cells in culture. In vivo, Cyr61 induces neovascularization and promotes tumor growth. Cyr61 is a prototypic member of a highly conserved family of secreted proteins that includes connective tissue growth factor, nephroblastoma overexpressed, Elm-1/WISP-1, Cop-1/WISP-2, and WISP-3. Encoded by an immediate early gene, Cyr61 synthesis is induced by serum growth factors in cultured fibroblasts and in dermal fibroblasts during cutaneous wound healing. We previously demonstrated that Cyr61 mediates adhesion of vascular endothelial cells and activation-dependent adhesion of blood platelets through direct interaction with integrins αVβ3 and αIIbβ3, respectively. In this study, we show that the adhesion of primary human skin fibroblasts to Cyr61 is mediated through integrin α6β1 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which most likely serve as co-receptors. Either destruction of cell surface HSPGs or prior occupancy of the Cyr61 heparin-binding site completely blocked cell adhesion to Cyr61. A heparin-binding defective mutant of Cyr61 was unable to mediate fibroblast adhesion through integrin α6β1 but still mediated endothelial cell adhesion through integrin αVβ3, indicating that endothelial cell adhesion through integrin αVβ3 is independent of the heparin-binding activity of Cyr61. These results identify Cyr61 as a novel adhesive substrate for integrin α6β1 and provide the first demonstration of the requirement for HSPGs in integrin-mediated cell attachment. In addition, these findings suggest that Cyr61 might elicit disparate biological effects in different cell types through interaction with distinct integrin receptors."

Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) have been classified in two groups dependent on the presence of either one (1-Cys Prx) or two (2-Cys Prx) conserved cysteine residues. Moreover, 2-Cys Prxs, also named thioredoxin peroxidases, have peroxide reductase activity with the use of thioredoxin as biological electron donor. However, the biological reducing agent for the 1-Cys Prx has not yet been identified. We report here the characterization of a 1-Cys Prx from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that we have named Prx1p.

We show also that Prx1p has peroxide reductase activityin vitro using the yeast mitochondrial thioredoxin system as electron donor. In addition, a mutated form of Prx1p containing the absolutely conserved cysteine as the only cysteine residue also shows thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase activity.

Increased levels of ROS, referred to as oxidative stress, can damage DNA, proteins, and lipid membranes (1.Storz G. Christman M.F. Sies H. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To cope with potentially destructive ROS, all aerobically growing organisms have developed antioxidative enzymes and antioxidant molecules to protect essential cellular components against oxidative modifications such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, thioredoxin, and glutathione.Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) form a recently discovered large family of antioxidant enzymes that act as peroxidases reducing hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water or the corresponding alcohol, respectively (for a review see Ref. 7.Schröder E. Pointing C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The activity of Prxs is dependent upon an absolutely conserved cysteine that is essential for the hydroperoxide reduction step (8.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxins differ from other peroxidases in that they have no redox cofactors such as metals or prosthetic groups (10.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Prx superfamily has been divided into two subgroups, 1-Cys Prx and 2-Cys Prx, according to the presence of one or two conserved cysteine residues. 2-Cys Prxs contain two conserved cysteine residues and use electrons donated by thioredoxin and were thus also named thioredoxin peroxidases (TPx) (8.Chae H.Z.

Thioredoxin (Trx) in its turn is reduced by NADPH through the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (Trr), the so-called thioredoxin system (14.Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The bacterial alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase (AhpC) also belongs to the 2-Cys Prx group, but it is reduced by a thioredoxin reductase-like flavoprotein (AhpF) using NADH or NADPH (15.Tartaglia L.A. Storz G. Brodsky M.H. Lai A. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10535-10540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-Cys Prxs form homodimers, and substitution of any conserved cysteine residue abolishes the Trx-coupled peroxidase activity (8.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The 1-Cys Prx proteins only contain the absolutely conserved residue. So far only one 1-Cys Prx present in human (hORF6 enzyme) has been characterized (9.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

In contrast to 2-Cys Prxs, human 1-Cys Prx does not use thioredoxin as electron donor, but it can reduce H2O2 using electrons from dithiothreitol (DTT). This human 1-Cys Prx has shown peroxidase activity in vivo, but the physiological electron donor has not been identified (9.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

The first member of the TPx family was characterized in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae as a 25-kDa protein that confers protection against damage by the thiol oxidation system (Fe3+, O2, and either DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol), and it was named thiol-specific antioxidant (Tsa) (10.Kim K.

For both types of thioredoxin peroxidases, the existence of two cysteines (Cys47 and Cys170for Tsa and Cys62 and Cys120 for Ahp1p) is essential to maintain the Trx-dependent peroxidase activity (8.Chae H.Z.

We have characterized the product of this open reading frame, which we have named Prx1p. In this paper, we provide evidence showing that this protein is a mitochondrial 1-Cys Prx and uses as electron donor the mitochondrial thioredoxin system that we have previously characterized in S. cerevisiae (22.Pedrajas J.R. Kosmidou E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wrigth A.P.H. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that Prx1p has a protective role in vivo against oxidative stress.DISCUSSIONPeroxiredoxins have been classified into two groups, one containing only one conserved cysteine in the N-terminal region that corresponds to Cys47 of yeast Tsa1p (1-Cys Prx) and another containing an additional conserved cysteine near the C-terminal region (2-Cys Prx). The 2-Cys Prxs referred to as thioredoxin peroxidases reduce peroxides with electrons provided from thioredoxin. 1-Cys Prxs can also reduce peroxides using DTT as electron donor, but the physiological electron donor for the 1-Cys Prxs is not known. When the hORF6 enzyme, a mammalian 1-Cys Prx, was characterized, it reduced peroxides using DTT but, in contrast to its homologous 2-Cys Prxs, did not show thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase activity. We were attracted by the existence of a potential mitochondrial thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase because we had previously identified and characterized a mitochondrial thioredoxin system (Trx3p and Trr2p) in S. cerevisiae (22.Pedrajas J.R. Kosmidou E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wrigth A.P.H. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The protein coded by the ORF YBL064C showed homology to peroxiredoxins and had a potential mitochondrial targeting signal, and although the product of ORF YBL064C belongs to the 1-Cys Prx group, we decided to test whether it had specific TPx activity with the mitochondrial thioredoxin system. The recombinant protein (Prx1p) had TPx activity, and it could also reduce alkyl hydroperoxides. Prx1p contains three cysteine residues in the positions 6, 38, and 91. The Cys6 would be removed in the mature protein, considering that the N-terminal domain is a presequence that is cleaved by proteases in mitochondria. Thus, there would be two cysteine residues (Cys38 and Cys91) which might be implicated in the thioredoxin-dependent reduction of peroxides. Cys91, homologous to Cys47 of Tsa1p, shares the conserved position common to all peroxiredoxins. A truncated Prx1p with the Cys38 mutated to serine, thus containing only Cys91, still preserved the thioredoxin-dependent NADPH-oxidation activity coupled to peroxide reduction. Also, Ser38-m-Prx1p did not form dimers upon denaturation in absence of thiol reducing compounds, but it behaved as a dimer when it was subjected to molecular exclusion chromatography, suggesting that other ionic and/or hydrophobic forces would be implicated in the dimerization of Ser38-m-Prx1p. These results suggest that Cys38 is not essential for the activity, although it is implicated in the stabilization of the dimer. The crystal structure of hORF6, the human 1-Cys Prx, has been solved and suggested that the protein forms a dimer. Prx1p is homologous to the human 1-Cys Prx and most of the amino acids important for dimerization (e.g. Phe43, Thr44, Pro45, Val46, Thr48, Thr49, Glu50, Leu145, and Tyr149) in human 1-Cys Prx (16.Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) are also conserved in Prx1p (Phe87, Thr88, Pro89, Val90, Th92, Thr93, Glu94, Leu188, and Tyr192). In hORF6 the conserved cysteines are too far apart for interacting with each other. However, Prx1 forms a dimer, and our results suggest that there is a disulfide bond, Cys38–Cys38, between the two subunits. This difference could be explained by the location of Cys38 in a 24-amino acid N-terminal extention not present in hORF6.Mitochondria consume approximately 85% of the oxygen demanded by cells because of the oxidative phosphorylation process where molecular oxygen is reduced to water but generate a great deal of ROS as subproducts. Thus, Prx1p with the mitochondrial thioredoxin system would offer a first line of defense against the main endogenous ROS-generating site in yeast cells. S. cerevisiae cells in a fermentable sugar-containing medium show a rapid, exponential fermentative growth phase with the production of ethanol. However, when the fermentable sugar is used up, cells reset their metabolic capacity from fermentation to respiration and continue growing much more slowly (respiratory phase) using the ethanol derived from the fermentation as a carbon source. The change from fermentation to respiration referred to as diauxic shift is paralleled by changes in mitochondrial development. During the fermentative phase, cells contain only few poorly developed mitochondria, but the exhaustion of glucose induces nearly full mitochondrial development (30.Pon L. Schatz G. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991Google Scholar). The levels of Prx1p paralleled the development of mitochondria when cells shift from fermentative to respiratory metabolism. These results are in agreement with the results obtained in a DNA microarray study to characterize changes in gene expression accompanying the metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration in which the transcription level of the ORF YBL064C coding for Prx1p was increased 11-fold (31.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar).In yeast, the transcription factor Yap1 plays a key role in the control of oxidative stress responses. Yap1 is a DNA-binding protein of the AP-1 family that binds to sequences homologous to AP-1 sites termed Yap1 response element (32.Kuge S. Jones J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the promoter region of PRX1, there is a potential YAP-1 site (TTAGTGA) 705 nucleotides upstream from the start ORF codon. Another element, designated as a stress response element with the consensus core sequence AGGGG, is able to mediate transcription induced by different forms of stress (33.Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Such an AG4 element is located 116 nucleotides upstream from the start codon of PRX1. Cells also overexpress Prx1p when exposed to H2O2, thus, the PRX1 gene would have to be included in the battery of H2O2-induced genes or H2O2 stimulon (19.Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee L. Buhler J.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).The sensitivity to oxidant conditions of the Prx1p-null cells also reflected the importance of this peroxidase in the yeast cell protection against heat shocks and exogenous H2O2 exposition. Although Prx1p also reducedt-BuOOH as efficiently as H2O2, the protein did not exert protection in vivo against the exogenous t-BuOOH. Similarly, although Ahp1p can reduce H2O2 in vitro, Ahp1p-null mutants did not show increased sensitivity to exogenous H2O2 (20.Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21.Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this sense, mitochondrial Prx1p could be more efficient in eliminating endogenously generated peroxides.In bovine mitochondria, a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase (SP-22) with high homology to yeast Tsa1p has been identified (27.Watabe S. Kohno K. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28.Watabe S. Hiroi T. Yamamoto Y. Fujioka Y. Haesawa H. Yago N. Takahashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SP-22 has recently been reported to play an important role in the antioxidant defense in the cardiovascular system (34.Araki M. Nanri H. Ejima K. Murasato Y. Fujiwara T. Nakashima Y. Ikeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mammalian mitochondria also contain a specific thioredoxin system that may provide hydrogens to the mitochondrial TPx (35.Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 36.Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pedrajas J.R. Gustafsson J.-Å. Spyrou G. Eur. J.

The presence of a mitochondrial thioredoxin peroxidase/mitochondrial thioredoxin system in both yeast and mammalian cells suggests an important role in the removal of H2O2 and a protective role in defense against oxidative stress and cell death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 such as the superoxide anion (O⨪2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (HO⋅) are generated in cells as major by-products of respiration and by a wide range of different environmental chemicals, ionizing radiations, or high oxygen pressures. Increased levels of ROS, referred to as oxidative stress, can damage DNA, proteins, and lipid membranes (1.Storz G. Christman M.F. Sies H. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8917-8921Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2.Wolff S.P. Garner A. Dean R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 21-31Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (467) Google Scholar). ROS can also induce uncontrolled cellular proliferation, aging, and programmed cell death (3.Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar, 4.Harman D. Proc.

To cope with potentially destructive ROS, all aerobically growing organisms have developed antioxidative enzymes and antioxidant molecules to protect essential cellular components against oxidative modifications such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, thioredoxin, and glutathione. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) form a recently discovered large family of antioxidant enzymes that act as peroxidases reducing hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water or the corresponding alcohol, respectively (for a review see Ref. 7.Schröder E. Pointing C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The activity of Prxs is dependent upon an absolutely conserved cysteine that is essential for the hydroperoxide reduction step (8.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxins differ from other peroxidases in that they have no redox cofactors such as metals or prosthetic groups (10.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Prx superfamily has been divided into two subgroups, 1-Cys Prx and 2-Cys Prx, according to the presence of one or two conserved cysteine residues. 2-Cys Prxs contain two conserved cysteine residues and use electrons donated by thioredoxin and were thus also named thioredoxin peroxidases (TPx) (8.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin (Trx) in its turn is reduced by NADPH through the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (Trr), the so-called thioredoxin system (14.Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The bacterial alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase (AhpC) also belongs to the 2-Cys Prx group, but it is reduced by a thioredoxin reductase-like flavoprotein (AhpF) using NADH or NADPH (15.Tartaglia L.A. Storz G. Brodsky M.H. Lai A. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10535-10540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-Cys Prxs form homodimers, and substitution of any conserved cysteine residue abolishes the Trx-coupled peroxidase activity (8.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1-Cys Prx proteins only contain the absolutely conserved residue. So far only one 1-Cys Prx present in human (hORF6 enzyme) has been characterized (9.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 16.Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In contrast to 2-Cys Prxs, human 1-Cys Prx does not use thioredoxin as electron donor, but it can reduce H2O2 using electrons from dithiothreitol (DTT). This human 1-Cys Prx has shown peroxidase activity in vivo, but the physiological electron donor has not been identified (9.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The first member of the TPx family was characterized in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae as a 25-kDa protein that confers protection against damage by the thiol oxidation system (Fe3+, O2, and either DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol), and it was named thiol-specific antioxidant (Tsa) (10.Kim K.

Thus far, three proteins with thioredoxin peroxidase activity have been identified in S. cerevisiae: two very homologous Tsa isoenzymes named Tsa1p and Tsa2p, also named type Iα TPx and type Iβ TPx, and one alkyl hydroperoxidase Ahp1p, also known as Type II TPx (10.Kim K.

For both types of thioredoxin peroxidases, the existence of two cysteines (Cys47 and Cys170for Tsa and Cys62 and Cys120 for Ahp1p) is essential to maintain the Trx-dependent peroxidase activity (8.Chae H.Z.

In this sense, mitochondrial Prx1p could be more efficient in eliminating endogenously generated peroxides.In bovine mitochondria, a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase (SP-22) with high homology to yeast Tsa1p has been identified (27.Watabe S.

Mammalian mitochondria also contain a specific thioredoxin system that may provide hydrogens to the mitochondrial TPx (35.Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol.

The presence of a mitochondrial thioredoxin peroxidase/mitochondrial thioredoxin system in both yeast and mammalian cells suggests an important role in the removal of H2O2 and a protective role in defense against oxidative stress and cell death. Peroxiredoxins have been classified into two groups, one containing only one conserved cysteine in the N-terminal region that corresponds to Cys47 of yeast Tsa1p (1-Cys Prx) and another containing an additional conserved cysteine near the C-terminal region (2-Cys Prx). The 2-Cys Prxs referred to as thioredoxin peroxidases reduce peroxides with electrons provided from thioredoxin. 1-Cys Prxs can also reduce peroxides using DTT as electron donor, but the physiological electron donor for the 1-Cys Prxs is not known. When the hORF6 enzyme, a mammalian 1-Cys Prx, was characterized, it reduced peroxides using DTT but, in contrast to its homologous 2-Cys Prxs, did not show thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase activity. We were attracted by the existence of a potential mitochondrial thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase because we had previously identified and characterized a mitochondrial thioredoxin system (Trx3p and Trr2p) in S. cerevisiae (22.Pedrajas J.R. Kosmidou E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wrigth A.P.H. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The protein coded by the ORF YBL064C showed homology to peroxiredoxins and had a potential mitochondrial targeting signal, and although the product of ORF YBL064C belongs to the 1-Cys Prx group, we decided to test whether it had specific TPx activity with the mitochondrial thioredoxin system. The recombinant protein (Prx1p) had TPx activity, and it could also reduce alkyl hydroperoxides. Prx1p contains three cysteine residues in the positions 6, 38, and 91. The Cys6 would be removed in the mature protein, considering that the N-terminal domain is a presequence that is cleaved by proteases in mitochondria. Thus, there would be two cysteine residues (Cys38 and Cys91) which might be implicated in the thioredoxin-dependent reduction of peroxides. Cys91, homologous to Cys47 of Tsa1p, shares the conserved position common to all peroxiredoxins. A truncated Prx1p with the Cys38 mutated to serine, thus containing only Cys91, still preserved the thioredoxin-dependent NADPH-oxidation activity coupled to peroxide reduction. Also, Ser38-m-Prx1p did not form dimers upon denaturation in absence of thiol reducing compounds, but it behaved as a dimer when it was subjected to molecular exclusion chromatography, suggesting that other ionic and/or hydrophobic forces would be implicated in the dimerization of Ser38-m-Prx1p. These results suggest that Cys38 is not essential for the activity, although it is implicated in the stabilization of the dimer. The crystal structure of hORF6, the human 1-Cys Prx, has been solved and suggested that the protein forms a dimer. Prx1p is homologous to the human 1-Cys Prx and most of the amino acids important for dimerization (e.g. Phe43, Thr44, Pro45, Val46, Thr48, Thr49, Glu50, Leu145, and Tyr149) in human 1-Cys Prx (16.Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) are also conserved in Prx1p (Phe87, Thr88, Pro89, Val90, Th92, Thr93, Glu94, Leu188, and Tyr192). In hORF6 the conserved cysteines are too far apart for interacting with each other. However, Prx1 forms a dimer, and our results suggest that there is a disulfide bond, Cys38–Cys38, between the two subunits. This difference could be explained by the location of Cys38 in a 24-amino acid N-terminal extention not present in hORF6. Mitochondria consume approximately 85% of the oxygen demanded by cells because of the oxidative phosphorylation process where molecular oxygen is reduced to water but generate a great deal of ROS as subproducts. Thus, Prx1p with the mitochondrial thioredoxin system would offer a first line of defense against the main endogenous ROS-generating site in yeast cells. S. cerevisiae cells in a fermentable sugar-containing medium show a rapid, exponential fermentative growth phase with the production of ethanol. However, when the fermentable sugar is used up, cells reset their metabolic capacity from fermentation to respiration and continue growing much more slowly (respiratory phase) using the ethanol derived from the fermentation as a carbon source. The change from fermentation to respiration referred to as diauxic shift is paralleled by changes in mitochondrial development. During the fermentative phase, cells contain only few poorly developed mitochondria, but the exhaustion of glucose induces nearly full mitochondrial development (30.Pon L. Schatz G. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991Google Scholar). The levels of Prx1p paralleled the development of mitochondria when cells shift from fermentative to respiratory metabolism. These results are in agreement with the results obtained in a DNA microarray study to characterize changes in gene expression accompanying the metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration in which the transcription level of the ORF YBL064C coding for Prx1p was increased 11-fold (31.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). In yeast, the transcription factor Yap1 plays a key role in the control of oxidative stress responses. Yap1 is a DNA-binding protein of the AP-1 family that binds to sequences homologous to AP-1 sites termed Yap1 response element (32.Kuge S. Jones J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the promoter region of PRX1, there is a potential YAP-1 site (TTAGTGA) 705 nucleotides upstream from the start ORF codon. Another element, designated as a stress response element with the consensus core sequence AGGGG, is able to mediate transcription induced by different forms of stress (33.Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Such an AG4 element is located 116 nucleotides upstream from the start codon of PRX1. Cells also overexpress Prx1p when exposed to H2O2, thus, the PRX1 gene would have to be included in the battery of H2O2-induced genes or H2O2 stimulon (19.Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee L. Buhler J.M.

The sensitivity to oxidant conditions of the Prx1p-null cells also reflected the importance of this peroxidase in the yeast cell protection against heat shocks and exogenous H2O2 exposition. Although Prx1p also reducedt-BuOOH as efficiently as H2O2, the protein did not exert protection in vivo against the exogenous t-BuOOH. Similarly, although Ahp1p can reduce H2O2 in vitro, Ahp1p-null mutants did not show increased sensitivity to exogenous H2O2 (20.Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2047114123,"A common posttranscriptional modification of tRNA is the isopentenylation of adenosine at position 37, creating isopentenyladenosine (i6A). The role of this modified nucleoside in protein synthesis of higher eukaryotes is not well understood. Selenocysteyl (Sec) tRNA (tRNA[Ser]Sec) decodes specific UGA codons and contains i6A. To address the role of the modified nucleoside in this tRNA, we constructed a site-specific mutation, which eliminates the site of isopentenylation, in the Xenopus tRNA[Ser]Sec gene. Transfection of the mutant tRNA[Ser]Sec gene resulted in 80% and 95% reduction in the expression of co-transfected selenoprotein genes encoding type I and II iodothyronine deiodinases, respectively. A similar decrease in type I deiodinase synthesis was observed when transfected cells were treated with lovastatin, an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of the isopentenyl moiety. Neither co-transfection with the mutant tRNA gene nor lovastatin treatment reduced type I deiodinase mRNA levels. Also, mutant tRNA expression did not alter initiation of translation or degradation of the type I deiodinase protein. Furthermore, isopentenylation of tRNA[Ser]Sec was not required for synthesis of Sec on the tRNA.

Ericson J.U. Esberg K.B. Ji-nong L. Björk G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A tRNA position commonly modified is position 37, the site immediately 3′ of the anticodon. Eukaryotic and bacterial tRNAs reading codons starting with uracil often have a large hydrophobic moiety attached to position 37 (2Björk G.R. Ericson J.U. Gustafsson C.E.D. Hagervall T.G. Jönsson Y.H. Wikström P.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 263-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One common modification is isopentenylation of the adenosine at this position, creating isopentenyladenosine (i6A).1Isopentenyl pyrophosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase is responsible for isopentenylation of this adenosine (3Bartz J.K. Kline L.K. Söll D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 1481-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The genes for isopentenyl pyrophosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase have been isolated in yeast and bacteria. The Escherichia coli gene is miaA(4Caillet J. Droogmans L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4147-4152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene is MOD5 (5Dihanich M.E. Najarian D. Clark R. Gillman E.C. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and theSchizosaccharomyces pombe gene most likely issin1 (6Janner F. Vogeli G. Fluri R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Roles for the i6A modification in cellular metabolism have mainly been deduced from mutant strains of yeast and bacteria lacking isopentenyl pyrophosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase activity. E. coli miaA −mutants show decreased translation of the trp operon (7Eisenberg S.P. Yarus M. Soll L. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 135: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and manifest a significant decrease in their ability to read through the stop codons, UAG and UGA, that is reduced by 75% and 60-fold, respectively, compared with wild-type E. coli (8Petrullo L.A. Gallagher P.J. Elseviers D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In MOD5 mutants ofS. cerevisiae, the efficiency of a tyrosine inserting nonsense suppressor tRNA is reduced relative to that of the wild-type organism (9Laten H. Gorman J. Bock R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4329-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, lack of i6A leads to inactivation of a suppressor tRNA in the antisuppressor strainsin1 of S. pombe (6Janner F. Vogeli G. Fluri R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the i6A modification is not required for attachment of an amino acid to tRNA by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (10Wilson R.K. Roe B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, this modification does appear to be important for efficient binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes (11Gefter M.L. Russell R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 39: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Isopentenylation of position 37 in tRNA appears to stabilize the first position of the codon-anticodon interaction and thereby assists in preventing first position misreading (10Wilson R.K. Roe B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, both in vitro (12Diaz I. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) andin vivo (13Bouadloun F. Srichaiyo T. Isaksson L.A. Björk G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 1022-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) evidence indicate that the i6A modification increases third position misreading due to decreased proofreading. Together these results show that, in yeast and bacteria, isopentenylation at position 37 in tRNAs reading codons beginning with uridine has important physiologic effects on translation efficiency, especially with regard to tRNA suppression of stop codons. Mammalian selenocysteine (Sec) tRNA[Ser]Sec also contains i6A at position 37 (see Ref. 14Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Carlson B.A. Moustafa M.E. Park J.M. Huh J.R. Kim M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5533-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar for subsequent work). Compared with other mammalian tRNAs, this tRNA is unique in that Sec biosynthesis occurs on the tRNA after it is aminoacylated with serine, it is 90 nucleotides long, which is the longest eukaryotic tRNA sequenced to date, and it contains only four other modified nucleosides in addition to i6A whereas other tRNAs contain many more modified bases (14Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Carlson B.A. Moustafa M.E. Park J.M. Huh J.R. Kim M. Lee B.J. Kelley J.W. Comprehensive Natural Products. 4. Elsevier Science Ltd., London1999: 353-380Google Scholar). Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec decodes UGA and inserts Sec into nascent selenopolypeptides. Recognition of UGA as a Sec codon and not as a stop codon requires a stem-loop structure or structures in the 3′-untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs as well as other translational factors specific for Sec incorporation (16Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examined the role of i6A at position 37 of tRNA[Ser]Sec on selenoprotein biosynthesis in vivo by generating Sec tRNAs lacking this modified base. Our studies indicate that structural changes at position 37 affect the decoding properties of the altered tRNA[Ser]Sec and its ability to decode UGA and incorporate Sec into proteins. The effect of altered Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec on selenoprotein expression is not because of differences in aminoacylation of the tRNA, biosynthesis of Sec on the tRNA, transcriptional events, protein degradation, or selenoprotein translation initiation. Most likely, the presence of i6A is important for efficient translation of Sec codons by tRNA[Ser]Sec.

The construct (A37C-XTSS) was created by site-directed mutagenesis using a 1.04-kilobaseEcoRI/BamHI fragment of the XenopustRNA[Ser]Sec gene (18Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.H. Jacobson K.B.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 1.04-kilobase EcoRI/BamHI fragment in 2 reaction steps. Initially, a fragment of A37C-XTSS was generated using the KpnI-tailed 29-mer (5′-CGGGGTACCCCACATCCACTAACAAACAG-3′) and the 19-mer (5′-GCTACAGGTGTGAAGCCTG-3′) to yield a 348-bp product.

A portion of each reaction was combined along with theKpnI-tailed 29-mer and PstI-tailed 29-mer and amplified by polymerase chain reaction using temperatures of 94 °C for denaturation, 50 °C for annealing, and 72 °C for extension. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified on a 1% agarose gel, cut with KpnI and PstI, and cloned into pGEM-3zf(+). The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51649) Google Scholar) performed by the Tufts University Department of Physiology Core Facility. A clone (A37A-XTSS) lacking the A37C mutation in the tRNA[Ser]Secgene sequence was isolated, sequenced, and used as a control. For isolation of tRNA[Ser]Sec fractions used in the codon binding studies, CHO cells were transfected by electroporation using 50 μg of plasmid DNA from either A37C-XTSS or the polymerase chain reaction-derived nonmutant A37A-XTSS. Cells were harvested 4 days post-transfection and stored at −80 °C until tRNA isolation. For [75Se]selenoprotein synthesis and experiments involving Western and Northern blotting, CHO cells were transfected, unless indicated otherwise, using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent according to the manufacturer. Briefly, CHO cells were seeded on day 0 in 6-well plates at a density of 8 × 105 cells/well in 1.5 ml of H-NCS. On day 1, the cells were transfected using 6 μl each of LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent with the indicated plasmids in serum- and antibiotic-free Ham's F12. After a 3-h incubation period, an equivalent volume of Ham's F12 containing 10% (v/v) NCS, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 mg/ml streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine was added. On day 2, the cells were refed with H-NCS. Further processing of cells is described in the respective figure legend. Transfer RNA was isolated by phenol extraction of CHO cells transiently transfected with A37A- or A37C-XTSS. The extract was loaded onto a DE-52 column and the tRNA eluted in 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Total tRNA was deacylated by incubation in 1.8 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 37 °C. Total tRNA was aminoacylated with [3H]serine under conditions of limiting tRNA and chromatographed in the absence of Mg2+ (20Chittum H.S. Hill K.E. Carlson B.A. Lee B.J. Burk R.F. Hatfield D.L.

To examine the intracellular [75Se]selenocystenyl-tRNA[Ser]Secpopulation, CHO cells were transfected with either A37A-XTSS or A37C-XTSS DNA by electroporation and allowed to grow for 4 days in H-NCS supplemented with 50 ng/ml Na2SeO3. The cells were harvested, radiolabeled for 4 h with [75Se]selenious acid as described previously (24Lee B.J. Worland P.J. Davis J.N. Stadtman T.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol.

CHO cells were seeded and transfected as described above. On day 3, the cells were radiolabeled for 3 h in H-NCS containing 2 μCi/ml [75Se]selenious acid unless otherwise indicated. Cells were washed and harvested for protein determination (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Probes were radiolabeled for 2 h at 37 °C with [α-32P]dCTP using DECAprime™ II (Ambion Inc.), added to a final concentration of 0.1 nm, and incubated at 62 °C for a minimum of 16 h. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed for 2 h in 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1× SSC at 62 °C with multiple changes of the wash buffer. Dot blot analysis of tRNA[Ser]Sec was accomplished as described previously (15Warner G.J. Rusconi C.P. White I.E. Faust J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5533-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of total RNA for Northern blot analysis by anti-i6A serum (32Faust J.R. Dice J.F. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5533-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were monitored by autoradiography at −80 °C in the presence of intensifying screens, and quantification was accomplished using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). CHO cells were seeded and transfected as described above. Cells were harvested for protein determination (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Protein gels were transferred to Protran (Schleicher and Schuell) as described previously (30Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS-Tween (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Rabbit antisera directed against a peptide in the N-terminal region of type I deiodinase (30Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:1000 dilution in TBS-Tween containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk. Alternatively, rabbit antisera directed against β-galactosidase was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase was used as the secondary antibody at a 1:4000 dilution in TBS-Tween containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer (NEN Life Science Products). One means of defining the physiological role of i6A on tRNA[Ser]Sec is to eliminate the adenosine at position 37, the site of isopentenylation. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we created an A37C mutation in the XenopustRNA[Ser]Sec gene (A37C-XTSS) by site-directed mutagenesis. Next, we transfected A37C-XTSS into CHO cells, isolated total RNA, and analyzed for Sec tRNA expression by northern hybridization with tRNA[Ser]Sec probe (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and2). This experiment shows that A37C-XTSS transfected cells express a new Sec tRNA with faster mobility than the endogenous CHO Sec tRNA. Upon quantification, we observed that the expression levels of A37C-Sec tRNA exceeded the level of the endogenous CHO tRNA by almost 4-fold. To determine if A37C-Sec tRNA was isopentenylated, we immunoprecipitated total RNA from cells transfected with either empty vector or A37C-XTSS with antiserum prepared in rabbits immunized with isopentenyladenosine (32Faust J.R. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and performed Northern blots on the immunoprectipates (lanes 3 and 4). Previous work showed that these antibodies do not recognize unmodified adenosine (32Faust J.R. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the endogenous, CHO Sec tRNA was precipitated by our anti-i6A antibodies in both samples, the A37C-Sec tRNA (lane 4) previously observed (lane 2) was not. These data indicated that transfection of A37C-XTTS results in overexpression of a Sec tRNA lacking isopentenyladenosine. We also determined whether lovastatin caused reduced levels of isopentenyladenosine in Sec tRNAs (Fig. 1 B). Lovastatin is a potent, specific inhibitor of mevalonic acid biosynthesis (35Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4356) Google Scholar), the precursor for the isopentenyl moiety at position 37 of Sec tRNAs. Lovastatin treatment of A37A-XTSS transfected cells did not seem to affect either endogenous CHO or exogenous A37A-Sec tRNA expression (lanes 1 and 2). However, the amount of i6A-containing Sec tRNA was reduced ∼50% in total RNA from lovastatin-treated cells (compare lanes 3 and4). The decreased anti-i6A immunoprecipitation in lovastatin-treated cells is consistent with reduced isopentenyl modification of the tRNAs. To address the effect that A37C-Sec tRNA has on cells, we examined the capability of A37C-XTSS transfected cells to decode UGA Sec codons. Fig. 2 depicts the synthesis of selenoproteins in CHO cells as measured by 75Se incorporation. As seen in untransfected cells (lane 1), there are several endogenously expressed proteins that contain75Se. This pattern is consistent with what others have found in similar labeling experiments (33Moustafa M.E. El-Saadani M.A. Kandeel K.M. Mansur D.B. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Diamond A.M. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1998; 4: 1436-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Gladyshev V. Hatfield D. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we analyzed selenoprotein synthesis in CHO cells transfected with plasmids containing cDNAs for type I deiodinase (G21-D10) and type II deiodinase (hD2/SelP). Transfection with G21-D10 alone resulted in the expression of deiodinase (compare lanes 1 and 2), and co-transfection with the A37A-XTSS construct appeared to have little or no effect on the level of type I deiodinase expression (compare lanes 2 and 3). However, co-transfection with the mutant A37C-XTSS construct resulted in a dramatic reduction in type I deiodinase expression (lane 4). Although type II deiodinase expression was not as strongly expressed (lanes 5and 6) as the type I form (lanes 2 and3), its expression was affected similarly by co-transfection with the wild-type (lane 6) and the mutant tRNA[Ser]Sec gene constructs (lane 7). Quantification of exogenously derived deiodinases and endogenous selenoprotein synthesis is shown in TableI. Expression of wild type A37A-XTSS gene had variable, but marginal affects on the expression of the deiodinases when compared with cells transfected with either G21-D10 or hD2/SelP alone. However, A37C-XTSS co-transfection with either deiodinase gene resulted in 78 and 94% decreases in the syntheses of type I and type II deiodinases, respectively. Whereas, expression of the wild type,Xenopus A37A-XTSS construct produced a slight increase in endogenous selenoprotein biosynthesis, the mutant A37C-XTSS gene led to a slight decrease. Synthesis of thioredoxin reductase (∼54 kDa) and the 24-and 18-kDa selenoproteins were reduced between 9 and 26% by A37C-Sec tRNA expression. The difference in the effect of A37C-Sec tRNA expression seen between the deiodinase proteins and other endogenous selenoproteins may be related to transfection or other translation phenomena and is addressed under “Discussion.” Neither result could be explained by decreased cellular uptake of 75Se. Uptake levels of 75Se, when normalized for cell protein, were not affected by experimental treatment (data not shown).Table IQuantification of selenoprotein expression after transfection with plasmids expressing tRNA [Ser]SecTransfectionType I deiodinase1-aQuantitative data of transfected proteins from Fig. 2 are represented and expressed as the percentage of control in comparison to the respective deiodinase construct alone.Type II deiodinase1-aQuantitative data of transfected proteins from Fig. 2 are represented and expressed as the percentage of control in comparison to the respective deiodinase construct alone.Thioredoxin reductase1-bQuantitative data of endogenous selenoproteins is an average of expression levels from transfection with either G21-D10 or hD2/SelP and expressed as percentage of control relative to the average of lanes 2 and 5.24-kDa protein1-bQuantitative data of endogenous selenoproteins is an average of expression levels from transfection with either G21-D10 or hD2/SelP and expressed as percentage of control relative to the average of lanes 2 and 5.18-kDa protein1-bQuantitative data of endogenous selenoproteins is an average of expression levels from transfection with either G21-D10 or hD2/SelP and expressed as percentage of control relative to the average of lanes 2 and 5.Deiodinase + A37A-XTSS11576114120103Deiodinase + A37C-XTSS226917481CHO cells were transfected with type I (G21-D10) or type II (hD2/SelP) deiodinase plasmid DNA alone or in combination with A37A-XTSS or the mutant A37C-XTSS gene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On day 3, CHO cells were pulsed for 3 h with 2 μCi/ml 75Se in H-NCS.

Although the effect was not as dramatic as in CHO cells, co-transfection of A37C-XTSS along with the deiodinase constructs into HEK-293 cells led to decreased syntheses of both type I and type II deiodinases (data not shown). It should be noted that [75Se]selenious acid incorporation into either type I or II deiodinase was not detected in either CHO (Fig. 2) or HEK-293 (data not shown) cells transfected with pGEM-T vector alone. To determine if the effect of A37C-XTSS was because of a general inhibition of exogenous gene expression, we transfected CHO cells with either G21-D10 or the β-galactosidase encoding plasmid DNA, pNASS, in the presence or absence of either A37A-XTSS or A37C-XTSS and performed Western blot analyses. As seen in Fig.3, transfection of A37C-XTSS reduced type I deiodinase levels (compare lanes 2 and 4) to a similar extent as that seen in Fig. 2. However, β-galactosidase expression was unaffected by co-expression of A37C-Sec tRNA (comparelanes 5 and 7). These data indicate that A37C-Sec tRNA does not act as a general inhibitor of protein synthesis, but inhibits selenoprotein expression (note that the immunoreactive protein seen at ∼21 kDa represents nonspecific binding of our antiserum). In the above experiments, the function of i6A was addressed by creating a mutation in the tRNA gene sequence, transfecting this mutant construct into CHO cells, and examining the ability of cells transfected with the mutant Sec tRNA gene to support selenoprotein synthes"
https://openalex.org/W2015323647,"Ligand stimulation of PDGF β-receptors leads to autophosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosine 857 and of tyrosine residues that in their phosphorylated form serve as docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. Regulation of the PDGF β-receptor by protein-tyrosine phosphatases is poorly understood. We have investigated PDGF β-receptor dephosphorylation by receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase DEP-1 using a cell line with inducible DEP-1 expression and by characterizing in vitrodephosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor and of receptor-derived phosphopeptides by DEP-1. After DEP-1 induction PDGF β-receptor·DEP-1 complexes and reduced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were observed. Phosphopeptide analysis of the PDGF β-receptors from DEP-1-expressing cells and of the receptors dephosphorylated in vitro by DEP-1 demonstrated that dephosphorylation of autophosphorylation sites of the receptor differed and revealed that the regulatory Tyr(P)857 was not a preferred site for DEP-1 dephosphorylation. When dephosphorylation of synthetic receptor-derived peptides was analyzed, the selectivity was reproduced, indicating that amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylation sites is the major determinant of selectivity. This notion is supported by the observation that the poorly dephosphorylated Tyr(P)562 and Tyr(P)857, in contrast to other analyzed phosphorylation sites, are surrounded by basic amino acid residues at positions −4 and +3 relative to the tyrosine residue. Our study demonstrates that DEP-1 dephosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor is site-selective and may lead to modulation, rather than general attenuation, of signaling.

Most RTKs are activated by ligand-induced dimerization, which leads to autophosphorylation (1.Heldin C.-H. Östman A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues are either involved in activation of the intrinsic kinase activity or serve as docking sites for downstream signaling proteins containing phosphotyrosine recognition domains, such as Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains (3.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases (rPTPs) are a family of enzymes composed of structurally variable extracellular domains, a single transmembrane segment, and one or two intracellular catalytic PTP domains (4.Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 5.Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The notion that rPTPs act as negative regulators of RTK signaling by direct dephosphorylation of RTKs has received some experimental support. For example, overexpression of CD45 reduces PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (6.Mooney R.A. Freund G.G. Way B.A. Bordwell K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23443-23446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and antisense-mediated suppression of LAR potentiates signaling of various growth factor receptors, including insulin and EGF receptors (7.Kulas D.T.

Also, data for negative regulation of EGF receptor signaling by rPTPς in A431 cells have been obtained by inducible overexpression of rPTPς and by down-regulation of endogenous rPTPς expression levels with an antisense approach (9.Suarez Pestana E.

Genetic screening in Caenorhabditis elegans recently identified an rPTP, CLR-1, as a negative regulator of signaling through the C. elegans fibroblast growth factor receptor homologue EGL-15 (10.Kokel M. Borland C.Z. DeLong L. Horvitz H.R. Stern M.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1425-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is largely unknown whether rPTP-mediated RTK dephosphorylation leads to general attenuation of RTK signaling by targeting of the regulatory phosphotyrosine or by general dephosphorylation or rather modulates signaling through site-selective dephosphorylation. The signaling mechanism of the PDGF β-receptor, an RTK expressed predominantly in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, has been extensively characterized (11.Heldin C.-H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the ligand, PDGF-BB, leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues. One of the autophosphorylation sites of the PDGF β-receptor, Tyr857, located in the kinase domain, regulates the catalytic activity of the kinase (12.Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

For some of the autophosphorylation sites, the SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins that bind to the site are identified, for example Tyr(P)740 and Tyr(P)751 in the kinase insert region bind the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositide 3′-kinase (14.Fantl W.J.

This study was performed to investigate the possibility that PDGF β-receptor is a substrate for DEP-1 and, if so, whether dephosphorylation leads to a general decrease in phosphotyrosine content of the PDGF β-receptor or rather results in dephosphorylation of specific SH2 domain-binding phosphorylation sites. We demonstrate dephosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor in vivo after DEP-1 induction, as well as physical association between DEP-1 and PDGF β-receptor. Analyses of in vitro and in vivoDEP-1 dephosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor, as well as of PDGF β-receptor-derived synthetic peptides revealed site-selective dephosphorylation, predominantly determined by the primary sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site.

Mouse monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody, PY99, was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). VSV-G monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Human recombinant PDGF-BB was from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and hygromycin B were bought from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), anhydrotetracycline (Atc) was from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium), and Geneticin (G418) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membranes, sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ig, ECL Western blotting detection reagents, [γ-32P]ATP, [32P]orthophosphate, and Na[125I] were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The components of the tetracyline-regulated (“tet-minus”) expression system, pUHD10-3 and pUHD15–1, (25.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. H. Bujard (Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie, Heidelberg, Germany). The DEP-1 cDNA was excised withEcoRI from the previously described plasmid pSV7d-DEP1 (17.Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and subcloned into EcoRI-linearized and dephosphorylated pUHD10-3. Introduction of a sequence for the VSV-G tag into DEP-1 cDNA was performed as described earlier (26.Groβ S. Knebel A. Tenev T. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Herrlich P. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26378-26386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmid pUHD10-3DEP-1vsv. Carboxyl-terminal HA tag was introduced into human PDGF β-receptor cDNA in the following way: the plasmid pcDNA3-PDGFβR was digested with KpnI/EcoRI and filled with T4 polymerase to remove KpnI,BamHI, and EcoRI. The carboxyl-terminal 600 base pairs of the PDGF β-receptor cDNA were amplified by PCR using the primers PDGF1A (5′-GTGGATGGCTCCGGAGAG-3′) and PDGF1B (5′-GTGCATTCTAGAGCTGGGTACCTATCCTCTGCTTC-3′). The primer PDGF1B introduced a KpnI site preceding the stop codon and anXbaI site after the stop codon. This fragment was used to generate the plasmid pcDNA3-PDGFβRKX. The fragment containing three repeats of the HA epitope followed by a stop codon was cut out from the plasmid pBSKS-HATAGA with KpnI and XbaI and cloned into the vector pcDNA3-PDGFβRKX opened with the same enzymes resulting in pcDNA3-PDGFβR-HA. The plasmid expressing the hygromycin resistance gene (pSB2hyg) was generously provided by Dr. Thomas Beckers (Tumor Research, ASTA Medica AG, Frankfurt/M., Germany). The expression plasmid pGEX-3X/DEP-1ic was generated by cloning a 1133-base pair EcoRI/EcoRI PCR fragment of HA-tagged human DEP-1 cDNA into pGEX-3X bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid encodes a fusion protein with an amino-terminal GST domain and amino acids 997–1337 of DEP-1 followed by a triple repeat of the HA epitope. Porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing human PDGF β-receptor (PAE/PDGFR-β; Ref.27.Westermark B. Siegbahn A. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4500 mg/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 1000 units/liter penicillin, 1 mg/liter streptomycin, and 400 mg/liter G418 at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% air. PAE/PDGFR-β cells were cotransfected with three plasmids: pUHD15–1, encoding the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator; pSB2hyg, carrying the hygromycin resistance gene; and pUHD10-3DEP1vsv, encoding VSV-G-tagged human DEP-1. The transfection was carried out with SuperFect according to the instructions of the supplier (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 day before transfection 4 × 105 cells were plated per 100-mm tissue culture dish. The vectors pUHD15–1, pUHD10-3DEP1vsv, and pSB2hyg were linearized, and DNA amounts of 3, 3, and 0.6 μg, respectively, were mixed with 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, and 60 μl of SuperFect were added to the mixture. This transfection complex solution was combined with 3 ml of medium and transferred to the cells. After 3.5 h of incubation, the solution was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium. Subsequently, cell growth medium containing fetal calf serum was added to the cells. 100 μg/ml hygromycin and 100 ng/ml Atc were added to the cells 24 h after transfection. After 3 days the hygromycin concentration was increased to 200 μg/ml. Atc was present throughout selection. For screening of DEP-1-expressing cell clones, cells were grown in the absence of Atc for 5 days. To suppress DEP-1 expression in these cells, Atc was added to culture medium when the cells were seeded for experiment (3 days before harvesting). Cells were grown to subconfluence in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml Atc and incubated overnight in serum-free medium, also with or without Atc. The cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 5 min at 37 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, and lysed in lysis buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 30 mmNa2P2O7, 1% Trasylol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mmsodium orthovanadate. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were done in aliquots of lysates derived from equal numbers of cells (cells were counted in parallel cultures). PDGF β-receptor was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of B1 and B2 monoclonal antibodies followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG or with R3 antiserum. DEP-1 was immunoprecipitated using 143.41 mouse monoclonal antibodies and rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Immunocomplexes were collected on Immunosorb A (Medicago, Uppsala, Sweden), washed four times with lysis buffer A, washed once with 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred from gel to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblotting. Detection was done using sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ig and ECL reagents. PDGF-BB was labeled according to Bolton and Hunter (31.Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). X23 cells were grown in 24-well plates to confluence, rinsed once with binding buffer (PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.068 mm CaCl2 and 0.05 mm MgCl2), and incubated for 2 h on ice in 0.5 ml binding buffer containing 1 ng/ml of 125I-labeled PDGF-BB and various concentrations of unlabeled PDGF-BB. After that, cells were washed five times with ice-cold binding buffer and lysed in 0.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol, and cell-associated radioactivity was quantified in a γ-counter. Cell numbers were counted using parallel cultures. GST-DEP-1ic fusion protein was expressed in JM101 strain of Escherichia coli. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside to 400 ml of log-phase culture, and bacteria were harvested by centrifugation after 5 h of culture at 30 °C. Bacterial pellet was lysed in 10 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mmDTT, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 20 min on ice and sonicated (five 30-s pulses at 10% full capacity, UW 2200 sonifier from Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany). The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 × g, and supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by slow rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with the lysis buffer. GST-DEP-1ic was eluted with 2 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm glutathione, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and stored at 4 °C. No considerable loss of activity was observed within 2 weeks of storage. Exact concentration of GST/DEP-1ic in the preparation was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis of the recombinant protein band excised from the gel after SDS-PAGE. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3-PDGFβR-HA plasmid. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB in binding buffer for 1 h on ice. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer A, lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and HA-tagged PDGF β-receptor was immunoprecipitated with HA tag antiserum for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected on Immunosorb A beads, washed four times with lysis buffer A and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitates were suspended in the kinase assay buffer, and autophosphorylation reaction was performed in the presence of 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by the addition ofN-ethylmaleimide to 10 mm final concentration, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. Aliquots of Immunosorb A-immobilized autophosphorylated PDGF β-receptor from approximately 1.5 × 106 transfected COS7 cells were suspended in 40 μl of buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and incubated with different amounts of purified GST-DEP-1ic for 30 min at 30 °C. Total reaction volume was 60 μl. Dephosphorylation was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and PDGF β-receptor was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membrane and visualized by autoradiography. X23 cells were grown to subconfluence in the absence or presence of Atc and starved overnight in serum-free medium, also with or without Atc. The cells were then washed four times with phosphate-free HEPES-buffered Ham's F-12 medium and incubated in the same medium containing 1.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h at 37 °C. Labeling was done in the absence of any PTP inhibitors, and 100 ng/ml Atc was added for the period of labeling, where necessary. After 4 h, the cells were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB added to the labeling medium, washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate and lysed in lysis buffer A containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. PDGF β-receptor was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of B1 and B2 monoclonal antibodies from lysate aliquots containing equal numbers of cells (cells were counted in parallel cultures that were not labeled with [32P]orthophosphate). Bands of in vitro or in vivolabeled PDGF β-receptor were excised from the nitrocellulose membrane and processed as described (28.Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Tryptic phosphopeptides were separated on thin layer cellulose plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (first dimension, 40 min at 2000 V) and ascending chromatography (second dimension, 15 h in isobutyric acid/n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/H2O, 1250:38:96:58:558, v/v/v/v/v). The resulting maps were exposed on BioImager screens (Fujix BAS 2000 Bio-Image Analyzer, Fuji, Japan), and32P content of the phosphopeptides selected for this study was quantified with TINA program as intensities of the corresponding spots on the image. The 32P content of the whole receptor was quantified as the intensity of the entire image. Phosphopeptides pY857, pY751, pY1009/pY1021, containing autophosphorylation sites Tyr(P)857, Tyr(P)751, and Tyr(P)1009/Tyr(P)1021, respectively, as well as phosphopeptide R4, were identified by their migratory position on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps, 2L. Rönnstrand, unpublished results. and their identity was confirmed by radiosequencing and phosphoamino acid analysis. Identification of peptide R12 as the peptide containing Tyr(P)562 is described in detail under “Results.” For phosphoamino acid analysis, 32P-labeled phosphopeptides were scraped off the plates, eluted from cellulose with electrophoresis buffer, pH 1.9, with chromatography buffer, or with 30% formic acid, dried, and hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin layer cellulose plates, as described (28.Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), and visualized by autoradiography. Edman degradation of eluted and dried phosphopeptides was performed as previously described (32.Blume-Jensen P. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14192-14200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Four phosphopeptides based on primary amino acid sequence surrounding certain autophosphorylation sites of human PDGF β-receptor were synthesized: KKPRpYEIRW (Tyr(P)562), DESVDpYVPML (Tyr(P)751), MRDSNpYISKG (Tyr(P)857), and EGDNDpYIIPL (Tyr(P)1021). N-α-Fmoc-O-phospho-l-tyrosine was used for the synthesis of the phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, lyophilized and dissolved in 200 mm Tris-HCl. Phosphopeptide solutions were adjusted to pH 7.5, and the exact concentration of phosphopeptides was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Dephosphorylation reaction was started by addition of 2 nm purified GST-DEP-1ic to a quartz cuvette (length = 1 cm) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 50 μmphosphopeptide prewarmed to 30 °C. Total reaction volume was 500 μl. Immediately after addition of the enzyme, dephosphorylation was continuously monitored by measuring the increase of optical density at 282 nm (33.Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), using a DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. The relative amount of each phosphopeptide left after 3 min of dephosphorylation was determined. To develop a system in which the effects of DEP-1 expression on PDGF β-receptor phosphorylation in vivo could be studied, the previously established PAE/PDGF β-receptor cell line (PAE/PDGFR-β) was supertransfected with constructs encoding the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator and a VSV-G-tagged form of human DEP-1 under the control of a tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator-regulated promoter. A number of clones with regulated expression of DEP-1 were obtained, and one clone (X23) was selected for further characterization (Fig. 1,top panel). A comparison of the level of DEP-1 expression in induced X23 cells and in human foreskin fibroblasts, previously shown to express DEP-1 (17.Östman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), revealed that induced X23 cells expressed more than 10-fold higher levels of DEP-1 (data not shown). DEP-1 expression did not affect expression levels of the PDGF β-receptor, as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, bottom panel). However, phosphotyrosine immunoblotting revealed that induction of DEP-1 expression reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of ligand-stimulated PDGF β-receptor (Fig. 1, middle panel). To exclude that this effect was caused by alteration in PDGF-BB binding to the PDGF β-receptors, a radio receptor assay using iodinated PDGF-BB was performed. As shown in Fig.2, there was no evidence of changes in PDGF-BB binding after induction of DEP-1 expression. Physical complexes between rPTPs and RTKs have previously been demonstrated, e.g. in the case of insulin receptor and LAR (46.Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 448-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether DEP-1 expression in X23 cells leads to formation of DEP-1·PDGF β-receptor complexes. The monoclonal antibody 143.41, which recognizes the extracellular domain of DEP-1, was used for DEP-1 immunoprecipitations. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the possible presence of co-immunoprecipitating PDGF β-receptor was investigated by anti-PDGF β-receptor immunoblotting of DEP-1 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 3, PDGF-independent co-immunoprecipitation of DEP-1 and PDGF β-receptor was observed. The finding that induction of DEP-1 expression in X23 cells leads to formation of the DEP-1·PDGF β-receptor complex strongly suggests that reduced phosphotyrosine content of the PDGF β-receptor in DEP-1-expressing cells is a consequence of direct dephosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor by DEP-1. To address the question of whether DEP-1 induction leads to a general decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor or rather changes the pattern of autophosphorylated sites, in vitrodephosphorylation experiments were performed. In these experiments, PDGF β-receptor labeled with radioactive phosphate in an in vitro kinase reaction was dephosphorylated using a purified fusion protein composed of GST and DEP-1 intracellular domain (GST-DEP-1ic) expressed in E. coli. After incubation of in vitro 32P-labeled PDGF β-recept"
https://openalex.org/W2140269625,"We investigated the intracellular route ofSalmonella in macrophages to determine a plausible mechanism for their survival in phagocytes. Western blot analysis of isolated phagosomes using specific antibodies revealed that by 5 min after internalization dead Salmonella-containing phagosomes acquire transferrin receptors (a marker for early endosomes), whereas by 30 min the dead bacteria are found in vesicles carrying the late endosomal markers cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors, Rab7 and Rab9. In contrast, liveSalmonella-containing phagosomes (LSP) retain a significant amount of Rab5 and transferrin receptor until 30 min, selectively deplete Rab7 and Rab9, and never acquire mannose 6-phosphate receptors even 90 min after internalization. Retention of Rab5 and Rab18 and selective depletion of Rab7 and Rab9 presumably enable the LSP to avoid transport to lysosomes through late endosomes. The presence of immature cathepsin D (48 kDa) and selective depletion of the vacuolar ATPase in LSP presumably contributes to the less acidic pH of LSP. In contrast, proteolytically processed cathepsin D (M r17,000) was detected by 30 min on the deadSalmonella-containing phagosomes. Morphological analysis also revealed that after uptake by macrophages, the deadSalmonella are transported to lysosomes, whereas the live bacteria persist in compartments that avoid fusion with lysosomes, indicating that live Salmonella bypass the normal endocytic route targeted to lysosomes and mature in a specialized compartment.

Many pathogenic microorganisms modulate this central process to survive in the phagocytes (1.Portillo F.G. Finley B.B. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 373-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phagosomes fuse with different intracellular vesicles and recruit various factors like hydrolytic enzymes, proton pumps, etc. (2.Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The docking and fusion of the vesicles are regulated by small GTP-binding proteins of Rab family (3.Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 4.Balch W.E. Trends Biochem.

Specific Rab proteins in active GTP-bound form localized on a particular vesicle regulate the assembly of the docking complex, thereby ensuring the specificity of the membrane fusion. How intracellular pathogens modulate the expression of these proteins to avoid or induce specific interactions of phagosomes with other vacuolar compartments is largely unknown. Morphological observations using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy show that phagosomes containing inert particles or dead microorganisms appear to follow the endocytic route culminating in fusion with lysosomes (7.Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Live organisms, however, use various strategies to survive and proliferate inside phagocytes (1.Portillo F.G. Finley B.B. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 373-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For instance, Coxiella burnetti (8.Maurin M. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Raoult D. Infect.

The pathogenesis of typhoid fever is related to the ability ofSalmonella sp. to survive in phagocytes (15.Keusch G.T. Isselbacher K.J. Braunwald E. Wilson J.D. Martin J.B. Fauci A.S. Kasper D.L. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.13th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1994: 671-676Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which Salmonella modulate their intracellular survival remains to be established. There are conflicting reports regarding the maturation of Salmonella-containing phagosomes. For instance, it has been reported thatSalmonella prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion (16.Buchmeier N.A. Heffron F. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other studies indicate lysosomal targeting (17.Rathman M. Sjaastad M.D. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2765-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Oh Y.K.,. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Berthiaume E. Jinks T. Miller S.I. Swanson J.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopic studies indicated that LSP1 bypass the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)-positive compartment that is normally encountered along the endocytic route to lysosome (19.Portillo F.G. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, it is largely unknown how LSP modulate their intracellular trafficking. Recently, it has been shown that Mycobacterium- containing phagosomes do not acquire Rab7 and Listeria-containing phagosomes modulate the fusion with early endosomes in a Rab5-dependent process (20.Alvarez-Dominguez C.

In the present investigation, we attempted to delineate the intracellular route of live or dead Salmonella by purifying phagosomes at various times after uptake and determining their contents of compartment specific markers. We demonstrate thatSalmonella bypass the normal endocytic route by modulating the expression of different Rab proteins and persist in a specialized compartment of low acidity.

Yeast anti-vacuolar ATPase antibody that also recognizes mouse protein was a kind gift from Dr. Andrea Jahraus (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Anti-Rab18 and anti-transferrin receptor antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Anti-cathepsin D and all the second antibodies labeled with HRP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). J774E clone, a mannose receptor-positive macrophage cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Philip D. Stahl (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin (50 μg/ml) and were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain was a clinical isolate from Lady Hardings Medical College (New Delhi, India) and was obtained from Dr. Vineeta Bal of National Institute of Immunology (New Delhi, India). Bacteria were grown overnight in LB at 37 °C with constant shaking (300 rpm). The bacteria were harvested in the stationary phase, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and used in phagosome preparation. For preparation of the phagosomes containing dead bacteria, bacteria were first incubated at 65 °C for 45 min and subsequently fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min (17.Rathman M. Sjaastad M.D. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2765-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complete loss of viability of the bacteria was confirmed by the absence of colony formation on LB agar plates. To determine the uptake of live and dead bacteria, Salmonellawere grown overnight in LB and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (22.Ziegler K. Unanue E.R J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1869-1875PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with PBS and grown in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mCi of [35S]methionine with constant shaking (300 rpm) for 9 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed five times with PBS to remove unincorporated radioactivity. For uptake assay, live or dead [35S]methionine-labeled Salmonella (1 × 107) were added to a 24-well plate containing J774E macrophages (1 × 106/well) and centrifuged at a low speed (2000 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C) to synchronize the infection. After incubation for different periods of time at 37 °C, the cells were washed five times with PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to remove unincorporated bacteria. The cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 to ascertain cell-associated radioactivity. Salmonella grown in LB as described previously were biotinylated for use as a phagocytic probe for the phagosomes using the standard method (23.Zurzolo C. Bivic A.L. Boulan E.R. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, New York1994: 185-192Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were incubated with N-hydroxysuccicinimidobiotin (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS-CM (10 mm PBS, pH 8 containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then the cells were sequentially washed with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl to quench excess free biotin and resuspended in PBS. Biotinylation did not affect viability as shown by the ability of the bacteria before and after biotinylation to form similar number of colonies on LB agar plate. An aliquot of live biotinylated bacteria was killed by heat treatment followed by glutaraldehyde fixation. Both killed and live bacteria bound same amount of avidin-HRP, indicating a similar density of biotin in both the preparations. To determine the biotinylated bacterial proteins in dead and live Salmonella, 1 × 107 bacteria were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and aliquots were run on SDS-PAGE. In both the preparations, multiple and essentially identical proteins were biotinylated to similar extents as indicated by Western blotting with avidin-HRP. J774E cells (1 × 106 cells) were incubated in the presence of avidin-HRP (200 μg/ml) for 60 min at 4 °C in cold HBSA (Hanks' balanced salt solution buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm TES, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) to allow binding. Avidin-HRP was internalized for 10 min at 37 °C, and cells were washed three times with HBSA to remove uninternalized avidin-HRP. Subsequently, avidin-HRP was chased for 80 min at 37 °C in the presence 1 mg/ml mannan for transport to lysosomes (24.Funato K. Beron W. Yang C.Z. Mukhopadhyay A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16147-16151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After washing, cells were allowed to bind biotinylated live or deadSalmonella (1 × 107 cells) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were resuspended in prewarmed medium, and uptake was carried out for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times to remove unbound bacteria by centrifugation at low speed (300 ×g for 6 min). Uninternalized surface-bound biotinylated bacteria were quenched by free avidin (0.25 mg/ml). Cells were washed twice and chased for indicated time at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by chilling on ice. The HRP-avidin-biotin bacterial complex was recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min) after solubilization of the cells in solubilization buffer (SB; PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 with 0.25 mg/ml avidin as scavenger). The enzymatic activity of avidin-HRP associated with the biotinylated bacteria was measured as fusion unit. Total activity measured after solubilizing the cells without avidin was about 6.8 ng of HRP/mg of cell protein. Background values corresponding to HRP activity associated with the bacteria, when the cells were chased at 4 °C and solubilized in avidin-containing SB, were about 3.5% (0.24 ng/mg of cell protein) of the total activity and were subtracted from all the values to determine specific fusion. Live or deadSalmonella-containing phagosomes were prepared using a method described previously (20.Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25.Sturgill-Koszycki S. Schaible U.E. Russell D.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6960-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). J774E clone macrophages (1 × 108) were incubated with 1 × 109bacteria at 4 °C for 1 h in HBSA, and bacterial infection was synchronized by centrifugation at low speed. Then the cells were shifted to prewarmed medium and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The uptake was stopped by the addition of ice-cold medium. Cells were washed three times to remove unbound bacteria by centrifugation at low speed (300 × g for 6 min). Subsequently, cells were resuspended in prewarmed medium and chased for different periods of time at 37 °C as indicated. Finally, cells were washed and resuspended (2 × 108 cells/ml) in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) and homogenized in a ball bearing homogenizer (26.Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 126-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged at a low speed (400 × g for 5 min) at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatants (PNS) were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. To obtain the phagosomal fraction, the PNS was quickly thawed and diluted with homogenization buffer (1:3) and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 1 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C as reported earlier (26.Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 126-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, phagosomes were further purified using the protocol as described previously (11.Sturgill-Koszycki S. Schlesinger P.H. Chakraborty P. Haddix P.L. Collins H.L. Fok A.K. Allen R.D. Gluck S.K. Heuser J. Russell D.G. Science. 1994; 263: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Briefly, the phagosomal fractions were resuspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors and loaded on 1 ml of 12% sucrose cushion. Samples were centrifuged at 1,700 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C, and the purified phagosomes were recovered from the bottom of the tube. The viability of bacteria in the phagosomes was determined by selective lysis of the phagosomal membrane with SB followed by cultivation of bacteria in LB-agar plate. Live Salmonella remained viable under these conditions. To determine the percentage of intact phagosomes, the phagosome preparations were treated with avidin at 4 °C to quench the biotin accessible in broken phagosomes. Subsequently, the phagosomes were washed and solubilized in SB in the presence of avidin-HRP. The difference in the HRP activity in avidin-untreated and avidin-treated phagosomes was used to determine the content of intact phagosomes. The HRP activity associated with avidin-untreated solubilized phagosome preparation was taken as 100%. About 74% of DSP and 70% of LSP remained intact by this assay. The purity of the phagosomes was checked by biochemical analysis to determine the contamination with other cellular components. Plasma membrane contamination was measured as described previously using the mannose receptor as the plasma membrane marker (28.Desjardins M. Huber H. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Briefly, the macrophages were allowed to internalize the bacteria for 5 min at 37 °C in HBSA and washed. Subsequently, the macrophages were incubated with HRP (500 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C to bind to the mannose receptors on the cell surface and washed. These cells were used to prepare purified phagosomes as described above. No HRP activity was detected in the purified phagosomes, indicating no plasma membrane contamination. To label the lysosomes, J774E cells were incubated with HRP for 30 min at 4 °C in HBSA, washed, and chased for 90 min (29.Ward D.M. Leslie J.D. Kaplan J J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After allowing the washed cells to internalize bacteria for 5 min at 37 °C, phagosomes were prepared. Most of the HRP activity was detected in the lysosomal fraction containing about 97% of total β-galactosidase activity, and no HRP activity was detected in the purified phagosomes. We have also measured the β-galactosidase activity to determine the lysosomal contamination both in LSP and DSP. About 3% of the total β-galactosidase activity were detected in early (5 min) LSP and DSP, indicating no lysosomal contamination (29.Ward D.M. Leslie J.D. Kaplan J J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, significantly higher β-galactosidase activity (12–15% of the total) was detected in late DSP (90 min) compared with late LSP (about 3%), suggesting lysosomal targeting of the dead organisms. The endosome contamination was determined by mixing an aliquot of PNS after bacterial uptake and an aliquot of PNS after 5 min of uptake of HRP at 4 °C (20.Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Phagosomes were purified, and endosomal contamination was measured as a percentage of HRP activity present in the phagosome compared with the total activity present in the PNS. Less than 0.2% of the HRP activity in the phagosomal fraction indicates the purity of the phagosome. The galactosyltransferase activity (30.Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) was measured to check the Golgi contamination using [3H]UDP-galactose, which is found to be about 3% of the total activity in the purified phagosome. Similarly, no glucose 6-phosphatase (31.Fleischer S. Kervina M Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 6-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) activity was detected in purified phagosomes, indicating that the phagosomes are free of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi contamination. The HRP activity was measured in a 96-well microplate (Costar Co.) usingo-phenylenediamine as the chromogenic substrate (32.Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Briefly, the final pellet after the fusion reaction was resuspended in 20 μl of PBS and transferred to microplates. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of 0.05 n sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing o-phenylenediamine (0.75 mg/ml) and 0.006% H2O2. After 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.1 nH2SO4, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. To analyze the phagosomal composition at different time points, 40 μg of purified phagosomes from each time point were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with appropriate dilution of respective monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase, and blots were visualized by using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). J774E cells (1 × 106 cells) were incubated in the presence of mannosylated bovine serum albumin (MBSA) conjugated with 20-nm colloidal gold (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in prewarmed HBSA to allow uptake. Cell were washed three times with HBSA and chased for 80 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mg/ml mannan to label the lysosomes (24.Funato K. Beron W. Yang C.Z. Mukhopadhyay A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16147-16151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After washing, cells were allowed to bind live or dead Salmonella(1 × 107 cells) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were resuspended in prewarmed medium, and uptake was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice to remove the uninternalized bacteria and chased for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed five times with cold PBS and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m cacodylate buffer pH 7.2, washed, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. The cells were rinsed and dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in araldite (27.Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thin sections were double stained with uranyl acetate and examined with an electron microscope. Lysosomes of the J774E cells were labeled with MBSA conjugated with 20-nm colloidal gold, and the cells were infected with dead or live Salmonella as described above. Cells were washed twice to remove the uninternalized bacteria and chased for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in LR White resin. Ultrathin sections of the LR White-embedded cells were blocked with 3% casein in 0.001% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Sections were washed five times with PBS-Tween 20 and incubated with anti-Salmonella LPS antibody (1:50) for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were washed five times in similar manner, and they were incubated with protein A-conjugated with 5-nm colloidal gold for 30 min at 37 °C to allow the detection of primary antibody binding sites on Salmonella. Finally, the cells were stained with uranyl acetate and viewed in a transmission electron microscope (Jeol 1200 EX 11). Because the intracellular trafficking of phagosomes containing dead or liveSalmonella might depend on their rate of uptake by the macrophages, we determined the rate of uptake of liveSalmonella by the macrophages in comparison with deadSalmonella, which will be targeted to the lysosome like any other inert particles (28.Desjardins M. Huber H. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). When J774E macrophages were incubated with metabolically labeled live or dead Salmonella at 37 °C for different periods of times, the rates of uptake of both preparations of Salmonella were essentially the same and reached a steady state plateau at about 20 min (Fig.1). Thus, the number of live or deadSalmonella associated with macrophages at different time points was identical (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown thatSalmonella enter into the nonphagocytic cells by a membrane ruffling mechanism and that noninvasive mutant organism is unable to induce its uptake (33.Hardt W Chen L. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rathman et al. (34.Rathman M. Barker L. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that uptake of noninvasive mutant organism in phagocytes is probably mediated through a host cell-directed mechanism such as lectinophagocytosis, as opposed to pathogen-induced membrane ruffling. This is consistent with our finding that both live and dead bacteria labeled with calcein and ethidium homodimer, respectively, are internalized by macrophages with similar efficiency (data not shown). To quantify the transport of the live or dead Salmonella from the early compartment to the lysosomes, cells were preloaded with avidin-HRP and chased for 90 min to label the lysosomes (24.Funato K. Beron W. Yang C.Z. Mukhopadhyay A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16147-16151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were pulsed with live or dead biotinylated bacteria at 37 °C for a short period of time (5 min) to restrict their entry to the early compartment followed by a chase. At the indicated times the formation of bacteria biotin-avidin-HRP complex was measured to determine the transport of the Salmonella to lysosomes. The results presented in Fig.2 show that dead Salmonellaco-localized with avidin-HRP-preloaded lysosomes within 45 min, and maximum fusion was observed within 90 min. In contrast, liveSalmonella did not form complexes with avidin-HRP even after 90 min. These results were further supported by the electron microscopic observations shown in Fig. 3in which macrophages were preloaded with MBSA conjugated with 20-nm colloidal gold to label the lysosomal compartment. The results presented in Fig. 3 (a and b) show that liveSalmonella were found in a distinct vesicular compartment that was well separated from the 20-nm gold-containing compartment. In contrast, dead bacteria after 60 min of chase at 37 °C were colocalized with 20-nm gold- labeled compartment (Fig. 3, cand d). After 90 min of chase the morphology of the dead bacteria was not well preserved, suggesting possible degradation of the dead bacteria. The presence of the dead bacteria was confirmed by treating the sections with an antibody against SalmonellaLPS followed by protein A conjugated with 5-nm gold particles for visualization. Extensive colocalization of the 5-nm gold particles was observed with 20-nm gold particles, suggesting the targeting of the dead organisms to the lysosomes (Fig. 4,c and d). In contrast, live bacterial morphology were well preserved after 90 min of chase and not colocalized with 20-nm gold particles, demonstrating that live bacteria survive in a specialized compartment and thereby"

We previously reported that, whereas cytochromes c from higher eukaryotes can activate caspases in Xenopus egg and mammalian cytosols, iso-1 and iso-2 cytochromes c from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot. Here we examine whether the inactivity of the yeast isoforms is related to a post-translational modification of lysine 72,N-ε-trimethylation. This modification was found to abrogate pro-apoptotic activity of metazoan cytochrome cexpressed in yeast. However, iso-1 cytochrome c lacking the trimethylation modification also was devoid of pro-apoptotic activity. Thus, both lysine 72 trimethylation and other features of the iso-1 sequence preclude pro-apoptotic activity. Competition studies suggest that the lack of pro-apoptotic activity was associated with a low affinity for Apaf-1. As cytochromes c that lack apoptotic function still support respiration, different mechanisms appear to be involved in the two activities.

In living cells, cytochrome c is present in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, where it plays an indispensable role in respiration. During apoptosis, however, cytochrome c translocates to the cytosol by mechanisms that are still unclear (reviewed in Refs. 1.Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar and 2.Martinou J.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 in a dATP/ATP-dependent manner (3.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

The ensuing recruitment and activation of caspase-9 results in activation of further caspases, such as caspase-3, which orchestrate the final packaging of the apoptotic cell (see, e.g., Refs. 9.Liu X.

The resulting apocytochromes c are subsequently translocated through the outer mitochondrial membrane. In the intermembrane space, heme is covalently attached by thioether linkages to two cysteine residues at positions 14 and 17 of the protein, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, cytochrome c heme lyase. Heme attachment is accompanied by a transition from a partially extended to a more compact conformation. Cytochrome c import depends neither on the electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane nor on the presence of ATP (12.Dumont M.E. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 17: 103-126Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sequences involved in targeting cytochrome c to mitochondria have been investigated in yeast and do not involve specific N-terminal sequences (13.Wang X. Dumont M.E. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6594-6604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The complete sequences of 96 eukaryotic cytochromes c have been determined, constituting a rich source of information for evolutionary analysis and for evaluating structure-function relationships (14.Brayer G.D. Murphy M.E.P. Scott R.A. Mauk A.G. Cytochrome c: A Multidisciplinary Approach. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1996: 103-166Google Scholar). A total of 35 out of 103–115 residues are conserved in cytochromes c from animals, plants, and fungi, with 17 of these 35 invariant residues found in a region spanning residues 68–92 (15.Janbon G. Rustchenko E.P. Klug S. Scherer S. Sherman F. Yeast. 1997; 13: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal regions are highly variable; vertebrate cytochromes c begin with acetyl glycine at position 1, whereas the others have N-terminal extensions that may or may not be acetylated (Fig. 3 A). Cytochromes c are subject to the same co-translational processing events as can occur with other proteins synthesized in the cytosol, including cleavage of N-terminal methionine residues and N-terminal acetylation. These co-translational processes are dependent on the sequences of the N-terminal regions and are to some extent conserved in different species. For example, vertebrate cytochromesc are at least partially acetylated when expressed in yeast, although native yeast cytochromes c are not acetylated (16.Hickey D.R. Jayaraman K. Goodhue C.T. Shah J. Fingar S.A. Clements J.M. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant forms of yeast cytochromes c are acetylated when they have the appropriate N-terminal sequences (17.Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Specific lysine residues are methylated in cytochromes cfrom certain eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, and some protozoa, but not in animals (18.Paik W.K. Cho Y.B. Frost B. Kim S. Biochem.

Cytochromes c from many fungi, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contain trimethyllysine at the single position 72 (20.DeLange R.J. Glazer A.N. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3325-3327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that apocytochrome c is trimethylated co- or post-translationally by a specific methyltransferase before uptake by mitochondria (21.DiMaria P. Polastro E. DeLange R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4645-4652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Park K.S. Frost B. Tuck M. Ho L.L. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14702-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, vertebrate cytochromes c are at least partially trimethylated when expressed in yeast (16.Hickey D.R. Jayaraman K.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The biological function and importance of cytochrome c methylation is unknown, and mutant forms of iso-1-cytochrome c lacking trimethyllysine 72 retain nearly full activity in vivo (19.Takakura H. Yamamoto T. Sherman F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 23.Holzschu D. Principio L. Conklin K.T. Hickey D.R. Short J. Rao R. McLendon G. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7125-7131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What features of cytochrome c affect its pro-apoptotic function? As expected, heat denaturation abolishes activity (24.Kluck R.M. Martin S.J. Hoffman B.M. Zhou J.S. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The heme moiety is required, as holocytochrome c, which lacks a heme group, possesses no pro-apoptotic activity (25.Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the redox capacity of holocytochrome c, which is central to the molecule's function in oxidative phosphorylation, is not required for apoptotic activity, as redox-inactive zinc- and copper-substituted cytochromes c exhibit strong pro-apoptotic activity (24.Kluck R.M. Martin S.J. Hoffman B.M. Zhou J.S. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Microperoxidase, an enzyme-degraded product of cytochrome c, consisting of the heme group and approximately 11 amino acids, has no pro-apoptotic activity (24.Kluck R.M. Martin S.J. Hoffman B.M. Zhou J.S. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings indicate that certain structural features, rather than redox activity, of the holoprotein are required for its pro-apoptotic activity. Particularly interesting is the complete lack of pro-apoptotic activity of cytochromes c from the yeast S. cerevisiae(24.Kluck R.M. Martin S.J. Hoffman B.M. Zhou J.S. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 26.Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R.

S. cerevisiae expresses two isoforms of cytochrome c, iso-1 and iso-2, which constitute 95% and 5% of the total cytochrome c complement (27.Sherman F. Taber H. Campbell W. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and which possess similar respiratory activities (28.Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the molecular basis for the lack of yeast cytochrome c pro-apoptotic activity, with particular regard to the N-ε-trimethylation of lysine 72. Cytochromes c from bovine, horse, pigeon, and tuna heart (>95% purity) were obtained from Sigma.S. cerevisiae c iso-1 (N52I) and iso-2 cytochromesc were fractionated as described previously (29.Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Parker J.H. Inhaber E. Shipman N.A. Putterman G.J. Gardisky R.L. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5446-5456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas three unfractionated preparations of iso-1/iso-2 mixtures (≈95:5) from MMY290 normal yeast were prepared in two separate laboratories (Sherman, Bredesen) by standard methods (29.Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Parker J.H. Inhaber E. Shipman N.A. Putterman G.J. Gardisky R.L. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5446-5456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or purchased from Sigma.Escherichia coli-expressed horse heart cytochromec (HHCc1; courtesy of H. Roder and M. P. Kirpichnikov) and wild-type iso-1 (J72K/C102T) were produced as described previously (30.Pollock W.B. Rosell F.I. Twitchett M.B. Dumont M.E. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Trimethylated HHCc and non-trimethylated K72R/C102T iso-1 cytochromec were purified as described previously (29.Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Parker J.H. Inhaber E. Shipman N.A. Putterman G.J. Gardisky R.L. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5446-5456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after expression in a yeast strain (B-6748) deficient in both the iso-1 and iso-2 genes. Mass spectroscopic analysis (31.Krause E. Wenschuh H. Jungblut P.R. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 4160-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) of the yeast-expressed HHCc gave a single detectable peak of mass 12,397, whereas that of native protein gave a single peak of mass 12,355. This indicated that both proteins had the initiator methionine residue removed and the N-terminal glycine acetylated, but that the yeast-expressed protein was also trimethylated (additional 42 Da). Confirmation that lysine 72 trimethylation was responsible for the increased mass of yeast-expressed HHCc came from mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic digests. Native HHCc tryptic digest contained a fragment of mass 2082 (residues 56–72; GITWKEETLMEYLENPK), which was absent in digests of yeast-expressed HHCc (mass shifted to 2125). Together, these analyses indicated that the yeast-expressed HHCc was close to 100% trimethylated on lysine 72 and, as reported previously (16.Hickey D.R. Jayaraman K. Goodhue C.T. Shah J. Fingar S.A.

Plenum Press, New York1993: 117-141Google Scholar), contained no other modification compared with native protein. Yeast-expressed rat cytochrome c (RHCc) was expressed and purified by Koshy et al. (32.Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Garber E.A. Margoliash E. Protein Exp. Purif. 1992; 3: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is estimated to be only 20–50% trimethylated, based on peak sizes of trimethylated and non-trimethylated chymotryptic peptides LENPKKY (residues 68–74) separated by reverse-phase HPLC (32.Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Garber E.A. Margoliash E. Protein Exp. Purif. 1992; 3: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When expressed in yeast, both trimethylation and N-acetylation of RHCc are less efficient than that of HHCc (16.Hickey D.R. Jayaraman K. Goodhue C.T. Shah J. Fingar S.A. Clements J.M. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). N-Acetylated (25% of total) and non-acetylated fractions of this partially trimethylated RHCc were separated by cation-exchange HPLC and referred to as fractions I and II, respectively (32.Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Garber E.A. Margoliash E. Protein Exp. Purif. 1992; 3: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). N-Acetylation was indicated by NMR of each fraction and by Edman degradation of the chymotryptic peptide GDVEKGKKIF (residues 1–10) separated by reverse-phase HPLC chromatography. Thus, yeast-expressed RHCc fractions I and II areN-acetylated and non-acetylated, respectively, but both are equally trimethylated (32.Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Garber E.A. Margoliash E. Protein Exp. Purif. 1992; 3: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Concentrations of cytochrome c stock solutions were determined using the A 550 of fully reduced samples (dithiothreitol added in excess) and the molar extinction coefficient, 27.7 × 10−3. Mass spectrometric analyses were carried out on a Voyager Elite mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Horse heart myoglobin (16952 Da) was used as an external standard. The positions of the protease cleavage sites in the cytochrome csequence were identified by considering the molecular masses of the polypeptide fragments detected by mass spectroscopic analysis and the specificity of trypsin. To simplify nomenclature, the numbering of amino acid residues is according to the vertebrate, rather than the yeast, system (yeast iso-1 contains 5 additional N-terminal residues), and “yeast” in this work refers only to S. cerevisiae. Xenopus egg cytosol was prepared as described (34.Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 35.Newmeyer D.D. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir D.M. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. III. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1998: 127.1-127.6Google Scholar). Cytosol from mouse T cell A1.1 hybridoma (36.Fotedar A. Boyer M. Smart W. Widtman J. Fraga E. Singh B. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3028-3033PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines was obtained as follows. Cells were cultured to log phase in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, harvested, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline prior to washing in lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B, and 50 μg cycloheximide) and suspension in a volume of lysis buffer (supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) twice that of the cell pellet. Cells were placed on ice for 30 min prior to homogenization (100–200 strokes) with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon-coated pestle until cell lysis was ≈50% as determined by trypan blue uptake. Non-lysed cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation twice at 300 × gfor 5 min. Cytosol was separated from heavy membranes (containing mitochondria) by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Cytosol contained <5% of cellular cytochrome c as determined by Western blot comparison of the resulting cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (data not shown; PharMingen anti-cytochromec antibody clone 7H8.2C12). Xenopus egg and A1.1 cytosolic extracts contained 40 and 20 mg/ml protein, respectively (Biuret method). The pro-apoptotic activity of cytochromes c was assessed by their ability to activate caspases present in cytosolic extracts. Titration of cytochrome c provided a comparison of potency between variants. Generally, 1 μl of cytochrome c stock solution (or vehicle) was added to 10 μl of cytosol and incubated at 22 °C for up to 4 h. The ensuing caspase activation was assessed as follows. Extract aliquots (2 μl) were taken at several time points and incubated at 22 °C with the colorimetric peptide substrateN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (DEVD-pNA, 40 μm; Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) in 200 μl of a buffer similar to that used to make the extracts (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Production of the cleaved pNA (p-nitroaniline) was monitored at 22 °C by an increase in absorption at 405 nm (SPECTRAmax 250 microplate spectrophotometer) and calibrated against a standard curve of pNA (Sigma). Different vehicles used for cytochrome c stock solutions prepared in different laboratories had no effect on caspase activation by HHCc; (data not shown). All cytosol incubations were supplemented with an ATP regenerating system consisting of 10 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm ATP, and 150 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase. A1.1 and MEF cytosolic extracts were also supplemented with 1 mmdATP. Xenopus egg mitochondria (heavy membranes), light membranes (predominantly endoplasmic reticulum), and rat liver nuclei were isolated as described previously (34.Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria were obtained as described previously (37.Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) from three different S. cerevisiaestrains: B6748 lacks both cytochrome c genes,cyc1 (iso-1) and cyc7 (iso-2); B7553 hascyc1 integrated back at the cyc1 locus; and MMY290 is a normal control. Mitochondria and other fractions were either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Mitochondrial incubations contained a mixture of Xenopuscytosol, 10% v/v light membrane, 4 × 103 rat liver nuclei/μl, and the ATP-regenerating system. Mitochondria were added at 0.66, 1.0, or 3.0 mg of protein/ml. Mitochondrial protein content was compared among batches by absorption at 280 nm of mitochondrial aliquots in 0.6% SDS and calibrated using the Biuret assay. Apoptotic nuclear morphology of chromatin condensation, margination, and beading was assessed using Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide) staining (34.Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To examine cytochrome c release from yeast mitochondria incubated in Xenopus egg cytosol, extract aliquots were removed at various times and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 5 min) to pellet mitochondria. Cytosolic supernatants were removed and filtered through 0.22- and 0.1-μm filters (Ultrafree-MC; Millipore) to remove any mitochondrial membrane contaminants. Equivalent mitochondrial and cytosolic aliquots were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were probed with rabbit antiserum to yeast cytochrome c, followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We reported previously that vertebrate, but not yeast, cytochromes c, are able to activate caspases inXenopus egg (24.Kluck R.M. Martin S.J. Hoffman B.M. Zhou J.S. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and mammalian (26.Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) extracts. Here, we more carefully compare the pro-apoptotic activities of various eukaryotic cytochromes c in both Xenopus egg and mammalian cytosolic extracts. HHCc at 0.1 μm or higher caused maximal activation of Xenopus egg DEVD-cleaving caspases (DEVDases) within 10 min (Fig.1 A). A slightly lower concentration (0.06 μm) caused a gradual activation of caspases over 2 h, suggesting a partial activation of the Apaf-1 apoptosome complex. A similar high potency was observed for cytochromesc from bovine, rat, pigeon, and tuna heart, whereas cytochromes c purified from the insects Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster were approximately 10-fold less active (Fig. 1 B). Strikingly, however, yeast cytochromes c were devoid of pro-apoptotic activity at concentrations even as high as 100 μm (and in longer incubations; data not shown): a specific activity at least 1600-fold lower than that of HHCc. Mammalian extracts exhibited the same profile of responsiveness to cytochromes c (Fig. 1 C). In mammalian cell extracts, including those made from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown), a requirement for ≈ 30-fold higher concentrations of cytochrome c was observed; this may be at least partly attributable to the lower protein concentration of the mammalian extracts (20 mg/ml) compared with Xenopus egg cytosol (40 mg/ml). Caspase activation as indicated by DEVDase activation was corroborated by Western blot detection of caspase-3 cleavage in mammalian extracts (data not shown; PharMingen anti-caspase-3 antibody 65906E). That purified yeast cytochromes c failed to activate Xenopus egg DEVDases could have reflected an artifactual inactivation of the cytochromes during preparation. It was therefore important to determine whether native yeast cytochromesc, or indeed some other component of yeast mitochondria, might be able to activate Xenopus cytosol. We isolated mitochondria from either Xenopus eggs or from yeast and incubated them in Xenopus cytosol (Fig.2). As expected, Xenopusmitochondria released cytochrome c (Fig. 2 A) and activated DEVDases (Fig. 2 B). Yeast mitochondria also released most of their cytochrome c (yielding cytosolic concentrations near 10 μm; Fig. 2 A) but failed to activate DEVDases (Fig. 2 B). Thus, even native non-purified yeast cytochromes c cannot activate DEVDases. Furthermore, no other surface feature or releasable factor from yeast mitochondria, such as reactive oxygen species or an unknown analog of apoptosis-inducing factor (39.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar), appears capable of activating caspases. Examination of the sequence of yeast cytochromesc (Fig. 4 A) readily suggests one possible explanation for their inability to activate caspases. In yeast, the lysine residue at position 72 (position 77 in yeast nomenclature) is modified post-translationally by the addition of three methyl groups to the epsilon nitrogen group; N-ε-trimethylation of lysine is denoted by J. Lysine 72 is located on the “front” face of the cytochrome c molecule (Fig. 4 B), the portion of the molecule known to interact with all previously investigated binding partners. We examined whether trimethylation might interfere with the activation of Apaf-1 by cytochrome c. As the methylase present in yeast (and plants) trimethylates lysine 72 in all cytochromes cexpressed in yeast (16.Hickey D.R. Jayaraman K. Goodhue C.T. Shah J. Fingar S.A. Clements J.M. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we expressed HHCc in yeast, obtaining close to 100% trimethylation (see “Experimental Procedures”), and then tested the modified protein in Xenopus and mammalian extracts. Fig. 5 shows that the modified HHCc was devoid of pro-apoptotic activity. Further evidence that lysine 72 trimethylation abrogates cytochromec pro-apoptotic activity was provided by experiments using RHCc expressed in yeast. Purified fractions of this protein exhibited decreased pro-apoptotic activity (≈10-fold less than native RHCc; data not shown). As this yeast-expressed RHCc was estimated to be only 20–50% trimethylated (see “Experimental Procedures”), the partial pro-apoptotic activity may reflect the non-methylated portion. Collectively, these findings indicate that lysine 72 is important for the pro-apoptotic activity of cytochromes c. Moreover, trimethylation of this residue in yeast cytochrome c is one possible explanation for the lack of pro-apoptotic activity in this protein. To test whether yeast cytochrome c lacks pro-apoptotic activity due to the trimethylation of lysine 72, we tested the activity of non-methylated iso-1 cytochromes c. One iso-1 variant, J72K/C102T, is the wild type expressed in E. coli and thus remains non-trimethylated due to the absence of the methylase in E. coli. A second iso-1 variant, K72R/C102T, was expressed in cytochrome c-deficient yeast (strain B-6748; see “Experimental Procedures”), and is non-trimethylated due to the substitution of arginine for lysine. Both proteins contain a C102T mutation to increase stability of the purified protein (40.Cutler R.L. Pielak G.J. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Neither of the non-trimethylated iso-1 proteins exhibited pro-apoptotic activity in Xenopus and mammalian extracts (Fig. 5). A third non-trimethylated iso-1 variant expressed in yeast, K72A/C102T, also lacked pro-apoptotic activity. 2R. Kluck, C. Szabo, E. Y. T. Chien, E. Oldfield, and D. Newmeyer, unpublished data. It is unlikely that some unknown aspect of expression in E. coli is responsible for the inactivity of J72K/C102T, as E. coli-expressed HHCc retained full pro-apoptotic activity (Fig. 6C). It is also unlikely that the C102T substitution abrogated pro-apoptotic activity, as all of the active cytochromesc in Fig. 1 possess Thr-102 (Fig.3 A). Together, these results indicate that elements of the yeast cytochrome c sequence, apart from trimethylation of lysine 72, preclude pro-apoptotic activity in vertebrate cytosolic extracts. To continue our investigation of the pro-apoptotic behavior of cytochrome c (24.Kluck R.M. Martin S.J. Hoffman B.M. Zhou J.S. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 26.Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have examined the lack of activity of the yeast isoforms, with particular regard to the role of lysine 72N-ε-trimethylation. Cytochromes c from several higher eukaryotes can substitute for Xenopus cytochromec to activate caspases in Xenopus egg and mammalian cytosol (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic conservation of cytochromec pro-apoptotic activity is consistent with the hig"

Furthermore, no change in the activity of extracted p38/SAPK2 could be detected after incubation of cells at either 3 or 30 mm glucose.

However, the mechanisms by which glucose influences the expression of the preproinsulin gene are less well understood than those that control insulin secretion acutely.The 5′ flanking region of the PPI gene has been extensively studied and a number of important regulatory elements and trans-acting factors identified (10.German M.

We also provide evidence that elevated glucose concentrations may activate a related, SB 203580-inhibitable stress-activated protein kinase but that this activity is unlikely to be involved in the regulation of the preproinsulin gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMonoclonal anti-c-myc antibody 9E:10 was the kind gift of Dr. Gerard Evan (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, UK).

Briefly, firefly luciferase activity was measured by imaging for 5 min in the presence of 1 mm luciferin, and the sum of firefly and R. reniformis luciferases were assessed by a further 5-min imaging period in the presence of 5 μm coelenterazine. Individual firefly and Renilla activities for each cell were subsequently obtained by off-line image analysis.Immunocytochemistry and Confocal ImagingIn all cases, MIN6 cells were maintained in 0.5 mm glucose for 24 h prior to transfection with PDX-1 or PDX-1.c-myc. After stimulation, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100.

Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline between incubations and mounted on coverslips with Mowiol before analysis. Confocal images were captured using an upright Leica TCS 4D/DM IRBE™ laser scanning confocal microscope as described previously (21.Rafiq I. Kennedy H. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Lysates were prepared by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and adding 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na+ deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml−1 each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1 μm microcystin. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant taken for enzyme assay as follows. p38/SAPK2 was precipitated by adding 3 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 antibody and 20 μl of protein A (100 mg/ml−1) and tumbling for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A pellet was subsequently washed twice in assay buffer comprising 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in 10 μl of complete assay buffer (the above was supplemented with 12 mm mercaptoethanol and 2 mm protein kinase A inhibitor20; Sigma). 10 μl of ATF2 (1.25 mg/ml−1) was added, and the phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 mm [32P]AT (65 MBq/μmol−1) in 50 mm MgCl2. Incubation was continued for 15 min at 30 °C before the addition of 10 μl of SDS-based loading buffer, and electrophoresis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% polyacrylamide). The gel was dried, and autoradiography (Hyperfilm™, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described (33.Moule S.K. Denton R.M.

Quantification was achieved using ImageQuant™ software.Statistical AnalysisAll single-cell data were obtained from three independent experiments, with the number of single cells indicated. Unless indicated otherwise, pooled data are presented as the means (± S.E., given in error bars) for the total number of cells examined in these experiments.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined signaling pathways involved in changes in preproinsulin gene transcription and the subcellular location of endogenous and over-expressed PDX-1 in response to changes in glucose concentration.Regulation of PPI Gene Expression by PI3KOver-expression of PI3K led to a doubling of the insulin promoter activity at low glucose concentrations (3 mm) and a 1.6-fold increase at high glucose concentrations. A truncated form of PI3K (Δp85) lacking the inter-SH2 domain needed for interaction with the catalytic subunit of PI3K, and thus acting as a dominant negative, completely abolished this increase in insulin promoter activity. Moreover, Δp85 expression actually led to a reversal of the glucose response of the insulin promoter, that is, inhibition of promoter activity at high glucose concentrations (Fig. 2). This ability of high glucose to act in the presence of PI3K blockade as an inhibitor of the PPI promoter suggests that the sugar may normally activate both activatory and inhibitory signaling pathways. Only the former pathway, which normally predominates, would appear to require PI3K activation.Regulation of Trans-location of Over-expressed and Endogenous PDX-1 by Glucose Role for PI3KWe have previously shown that an elevation in the concentration of glucose prompts thetrans-location of PDX-1 tagged with a c-mycepitope, from the nuclear periphery to the nucleoplasmic region (21.Rafiq I. Kennedy H. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23241-23247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present studies we demonstrate that, like PDX-1.c-myc, endogenous PDX-1 resides largely within the nucleoplasm in cells maintained at either 3 or 30 mmglucose. Unlike PDX-1.c-myc, a small but detectable proportion of endogenous PDX-1 resides in the cytosol at 3 mm glucose. At elevated glucose concentrations, a further recruitment to the nucleoplasm of endogenous PDX-1 is apparent. However, endogenous PDX-1 does not show any evident association with the nuclear periphery in cells incubated at either high or low glucose levels (Fig. 2). Thus, a physiological importance for masstrans-location of PDX-1 between the nuclear periphery and the nucleoplasm seems unlikely at normal levels of PDX-1 expression. We suggest instead that the glucose-sensitive association with the nuclear membrane displayed by PDX-1.c-myc (and by over-expressed, untagged PDX-1) may reflect an interaction with nuclear import/export machinery normally involved in trafficking PDX-1 across the nuclear membrane. In nontransfected cells, this interaction presumably leads to the expulsion from the nucleus of the low levels of endogenous PDX-1 in 3 mm glucose but may become saturated when PDX-1 is over-expressed. Thus, the imaging of the subcellular localization of over-expressed PDX-1.c-myc may provide a convenient assay of the interaction between the endogenous transcription factor and the nuclear membrane, which is not normally evident. Although the composition and identity of the putative nuclear membrane binding protein(s)/complex is unknown, the recent finding by 2-hybrid analysis that the glucose-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiaerepressor Mig1 is associated with the nuclear exportin Msn5 raises the intriguing possibility that PDX-1 may be associated with a mammalian Msn5 homologue in β-cells.Consistent with the view that the interaction of PDX-1.c-mycwith the nuclear periphery may be important in controlling the nuclear:cytosolic partitioning of endogenous PDX-1, both parameters were regulated similarly by changes in PI3K activity (Fig. 2). In particular, the cytosol → nucleus trans-location of endogenous PDX-1 and trans-location from the nuclear periphery to the nucleoplasm of over-expressed PDX-1.c-mycboth occurred via a wortmannin/LY 294002-sensitive pathway. Further, the present studies show that in the presence of either inhibitor, elevated glucose concentrations provoke a decrease in the proportion of PDX-1.c-myc located in the nucleus. This behavior may therefore provide an explanation of the inhibitory effect of high glucose on the PPI promoter during PI3K blockade (see Fig. 1 and text above).Regulation of PPI Promoter Activity and PDX-1 Trans-location by Glucose Involvement of p38/SAPK2Recent studies of both PPI promoter regulation (18.MacFarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and PDX-1 localization (22.MacFarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton Edkins Z.A. Cragg H. James R.L. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have described an inhibition with the p38/SAPK2 inhibitor SB 203580 of the effects of glucose. In the present studies, neither incubation of cells with SB 203580 (Fig. 3 A) nor with arsenite at 3 mmglucose (results not shown) had any effect on PPI promoter activity. Furthermore, over-expression of a constitutively active form of MKK6, a kinase immediately upstream of p38/SAPK2 (24.Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), exerted no effect on PPI promoter activity (Fig. 3 B), whereas expression of this construct strongly trans-activated Gal4 promoter activity in a SB 203580-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C andD). These observations concur with the results of other recent studies (5.Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that reported an absence of any effect of SB 203580 on the stimulation of PPI gene expression at 16 mm glucose. Similarly, we observed no effect of manipulating p38/SAPK2 activity on the subcellular localization of endogenous PDX-1 or PDX-1.c-myc (see above). Although we have no clear explanation for the discrepancy between these and the previously published results of MacFarlane and colleagues (16.MacFarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.MacFarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), it is possible that differences in experimental protocols (e.g. in studies of PPI promoter activity:microinjection versustransfection; pre-culture in 3 mm rather than 0.5 mm glucose; normalization to the activity of a nonregulated promoter) may be involved. A further possibility, which may explain the effects of SB 203580 observed in earlier studies, may be a nonspecific inhibitory effect on protein kinase B, acting downstream of PI3K. 5C. Marshall, personal communication. Nevertheless, the present study clearly indicates that elevated glucose concentrations can robustly stimulate the PPI promoter in the absence of significant activation of p38/SAPK2.We also observed in these studies that elevated glucose concentrations stimulate the activity of an SB 203580-sensitive pathway, which leads to the trans-activation of the yeast Gal4.ATF2 chimera (Fig.3 C). Because elevated glucose was found to have no detectable effect on p38/SAPK2 activity measured in MIN6 cell extracts (Fig. 4 C), as also observed for the glucose-responsive INS-1 β-cell line (40.Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and human islets, 6G. A. Rutter and M. Dickens, unpublished observation. these data suggest that a distinct member of the SAPK family may be activated by glucose in β-cells. This activity may be more sensitive to the mild osmotic stress imposed by glucose (because of the intracellular generation of glycolytic intermediates and other metabolites) (41.Miley H.E. Sheader E.A. Brown P.D. Best L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 191-198Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) than p38/SAPK2. This alternative SAPK2 activity may be related to a protein kinase of molecular mass 63 kDa recently identified through the use of an in-gel kinase assay (42.da Silva Xavier G. Dickens M. Rutter G.A. Diabetologia. 1999; 42 Suppl.: A124Google Scholar). Whether this activity represents SAPK3/Erk6 (43.Cuenda A. Goedert M. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. Biochem Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: S569Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) is a possibility that remains to be resolved. It now seems feasible that the activation by glucose of MAP kinase activating protein kinase-2, an immediate downstream target of p38/SAPK2 (44.Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar), observed by MacFarlaneet al. (18.MacFarlane W.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) may have involved this or another glucose/stress-activated protein kinase.Regulation of PI3K by GlucoseThe present work indicates that the activation of PI3K is important for the regulation of PDX-1 and for stimulated preproinsulin gene transcription. Indeed, our results suggest that activation of this enzyme is both necessary and sufficient for PDX-1 trans-location and necessary for insulin promoter activation. Supporting this view, GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) was shown to increase PI3K activity in INS-1 cells and to increase insulin mRNA and the DNA binding activity of PDX-1, an effect inhibited by LY 294002 (45.Buteau J. Roduit R. Susini S. Prentki M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).Because PI3K is a downstream target of insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2, and insulin exerts its effects via PI3K in “classical” insulin-responsive cells (46.Alessi D.R. Downes C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a role for insulin has been suggested in the activation of the preproinsulin gene (47.Xu G.G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R443-R445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for this role of insulin came from a study in which insulin secreted from the β-cell (both rat islets and HIT-T15 cells) was shown to have a feed forward effect on its biosynthesis by enhancing preproinsulin gene transcription (5.Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This autocrine response was further shown to involve the insulin receptor PI3K, p70S6 kinase, and calmodulin kinase pathways. The involvement of PDX-1 in this novel pathway of PPI gene activation is uncertain, although unpublished observations by MacFarlane et al. (22.MacFarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton Edkins Z.A.

We have also examined the effect of insulin on PPI promoter activity in MIN6 cells but found no discernible effect at concentrations of 100 nm (34.Kennedy H.J. Rafiq I. Pouli A.E. Rutter G.A.

Conversely, αβγ-rENaC stimulated CFTR-mediated Cl− currents up to ∼6-fold. Deletion mutations in the intracellular tails of the three rENaC subunits suggested that the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit was required both for the down-regulation of ENaC by activated CFTR and the up-regulation of CFTR by ENaC. However, both the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit and the amino terminus of the γ subunit were essential for the down-regulation of rENaC by unstimulated CFTR. Interestingly, down-regulation of rENaC by activated CFTR was Cl−-dependent, while stimulation of CFTR by rENaC was not dependent on either cytoplasmic Na+ or a depolarized membrane potential.

Elimination of the inhibitory effect on ENaC by CFTR has been proposed to account for the observed hyperabsorption of Na+ in the airway and gastrointestinal epithelia of CF patients that lack functional CFTR. The simplest explanation would be a direct physical protein-protein interaction between CFTR and ENaC. Kunzelmann's group (4Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) identified a possible protein-protein interaction between CFTR and ENaC using the yeast two-hybrid analysis system. These authors concluded that CFTR physically interacted with the COOH terminus of α-rENaC. However, Berdiev et al. (10Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Karlson K.H. Stanton B.A. Ismailov I.I. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1881-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that CFTR could not down-regulate channels comprised only of α-rENaC, and that the β- and/or γ-ENaC subunits were required for CFTR's functional interaction with ENaC. Nonetheless, CFTR's ability to down-regulate wild-type αβγ-rENaC was lost if COOH-terminal-truncated α-rENaC replaced wild-type α-rENaC. In addition, Schreiber et al. (11Schreiber R. Hopf A. Mall M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5310-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that the first nucleotide-binding domain of CFTR was essential in the inhibition of the epithelial sodium conductance. However, few studies have examined the influence of ENaC on CFTR activity (12Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, truncation and missense mutations in the cytoplasmic NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC subunits of rENaC were co-expressed with CFTR inXenopus oocytes to identify domains within ENaC that are essential for the molecular interactions between ENaC and CFTR. Electrophysiological studies of macroscopic currents showed that CFTR activity is up-regulated by rENaC co-expression, and rENaC current is inhibited by both quiescent (i.e. non-conducting) and activated CFTR. Studies in which the cytosolic tails of rENaC subunits were truncated demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of the β-rENaC subunit was required for the functional interaction between activated CFTR and rENaC, while the amino termini of the β and γ subunits were critical for the down-regulation of rENaC by quiescent CFTR. Therefore, at least two distinct mechanisms are involved in the intermolecular regulation of CFTR and rENaC. The cDNA constructs of wt α-, β-, and γ-rENaC cloned from rat colon and the Liddle's mutants were the kind gifts from Drs. Cecilia Canessa and Bernard Rossier (13Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D.

Deletions of the cytoplasmic NH2 termini of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC were made by PCR-based mutagenesis as described previously (17Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32889-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-rENaC constructs were prepared as described before (18Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I.

In brief, and pEGFP-γ rENaC were constructed by excising the full-length subunits from pSport/β rENaC or pSport/γ rENaC with SalI/KpnI, and ligating the excised fragment into SalI/KpnI digested pEGFP-Cl or C2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Two pre-existing stop codons in the β subunit were removed using a synthesized sense primer corresponding to nucleotides 1–20 and an antisense primer corresponding to nucleotides 514–543. PCR was performed, and the product was subcloned into pCR 2.1. The fusion cDNA EGFP rENaC was constructed by digesting the subcloned PCR product with SalI/BsmBI and ligating the gel purified 316-base pair PCR fragment into digested cDNA. EGFP-β-rENaC then was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (InVitrogen) usingNheI and KpnI. pcDNA3.1 was digested withNheI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to prevent self-ligation. The sequence of both strands was confirmed by ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing. cDNAs of full-length, truncated, and missense mutations of rENaC were transcribed in vitro by using T7 transcription kits (Ambion, Austin, TX), following the manufacturer's instructions. The protocol for channel expression in oocytes was the same as described previously (19Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1182-C1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, female Xenopus laevis, purchased fromXenopus Express (Burley Hill, FL), were anesthetized in 0.5% ice/tricaine (Sigma) solution. Ovary lobes were harvested through a small abdominal incision. Healthy oocytes at maturation stage V and VI were identified following 2–3 h rotating digestion with 3 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) in Ca2+-free OR-2 medium (in mm: 82.5 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4). Oocytes were incubated in half-strength Leibovitz medium (L15) overnight before cRNA microinjection. Using a nano-microinjector (Drummond Science Co., Broomall, PA), 2.5 ng of cRNA of CFTR, or 12.5 ng of cRNA of each subunit of αβγ-rENaC or their combination in a volume of 50 nl, was injected into each oocyte. Conventional two-electrode voltage clamp was used to record the macroscopic currents associated with rENaCs and CFTR. Oocytes were impaled with two microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl. The tip resistance was 0.5–2.0 MΩ. Oocytes were voltage clamped at a holding potential of −30 mV using pCLAMP 6.0.4 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) through a TEA-200 voltage clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Two reference electrodes were connected to the bath by 3 m KCl, 3% agar bridges. Oocytes were continuously superfused at a rate of 3 ml/min in a small holding chamber with a volume of approximately 100 μl. The normal superfusate was Ringer's solution (in mm: 110 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 0.2 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES, pH 7.4). Both inward and outward currents were monitored at holding potentials of −100 and +40 mV, respectively, at an interval of 10–30 s. The stepped I-V curves were collected when the rENaC-induced currents were stable. The perfusing system was driven by gravity, and the superfusates were switched from Ringer's solution to those of the desired composition. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). The same set of oocytes and the same batch of cRNAs were used to study the interaction of CFTR and rENaCs. Oocytes were transferred to the recording chamber 48 or 72 h post-cRNA injection, and superfused with Ringer's solution at room temperature. For oocytes only expressing rENaCs, rENaC current was calculated as the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current by subtracting the amiloride-resistant current from the total current measured in the absence of amiloride (10 μm). For oocytes only expressing CFTR, the differences between the currents recorded in the absence and in the presence of a cAMP-stimulating mixture (CKT: 0.2 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 0.2 mm cAMP, 10 μmforskolin) were computed as CFTR-associated Cl− currents. For oocytes co-expressing CFTR and rENaC, the protocol we used was first to add 10 μm amiloride to obtain the maximal rENaC current, followed by extensive washing to remove the amiloride. Then, oocytes were either treated with CKT or the combination of CKT and amiloride until the total current stabilized. To test the specificity of the interaction between CFTR and rENaCs, the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− (CaCC) conductance of the oocyte was used as a control to see if wt αβγ-rENaC had any effect on its properties. A third microelectrode filled with 5 mm CaCl2 was impaled into ENaC-expressing oocytes, and 25 nl (approximately 100 μmCaCl2) was injected into the oocytes. Then the basal currents for CaCC or rENaC were recorded. Conversely, the pore-forming toxin palytoxin was employed as a substitute for rENaC to increase intracellular Na+ concentration and depolarize the resting membrane potential, to examine if these changes produced any effects on CFTR. The protocol for fluorescence image acquisition has been described previously (17Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, healthy oocytes were injected with one group of the following cRNAs: EGFP-CFTR; EGFP-CFTR + αβγ-rENaC; α-rENaC + EGFP-β-rENaC + EGFP-γ-rENaC; α-rENaC + EGFP-β rENaC + EGFP-γ-rENaC + CFTR. The total injected cRNA of CFTR and αβγ-rENaC, the time for processing, and the application of CKT were identical to those for the voltage-clamp experiments. Water-injected oocytes were used as a control for background fluorescence. In order to identify the plasma membrane, eggs were incubated for 1 h with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (10 mg/ml, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Labeling was carried out in ND-48 solution containing 10 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the dark for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The biotinylation reaction was stopped with glycine (100 mm). After washing in L-15 medium, images were acquired using a Leica DMIRBE TCSNT Laser Confocal Microscope (Leica, Germany) with a 10 × dry objective, and equipped with an acousto-optical turntable filter and three detector channels. The 488-nm argon laser line and the 568 nm krypton laser line excited the GFP and Texas Red, respectively. XY scans were obtained at a 1024 × 1024 resolution format at approximately the mid-section of each oocyte. The distribution of EGFP-CFTR and EGFP-rENaC fluorescence present at the membrane surface was quantitated in randomly acquired, confocal xy sections at approximately the mid-section of each oocyte (18Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I. Guggino W.B. Langford G.M. Stanton B.A. J. Biol.

Using TSCNT software (Leica, Germany), a box (∼500 μm2) was drawn over the area to be measured, and the mean pixel intensity (on a scale of 0–225) within the boxed region was determined. Twenty sections of each oocyte membrane were recorded and averaged for each cell. Between 5 and 10 oocytes per condition were used in the analysis. Using pixel intensity histograms, the EGFP fluorescence and means were evaluated to determine the relative expression of EGFP-CFTR or EGFP-rENaC before and after the addition of CKT. cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT transcription/translation system from Promega, in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes (22Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding full-length, epitope-tagged α-, β-, and γ-rENaC subunits are described elsewhere (22Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

The synthesized proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylmide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography, or reconstituted into proteoliposomes and immunoprecipitated. To test for protein-protein interactions between different rENaC subunits and CFTR, the rENaC subunits and CFTR were translated either with radioactive methionine or with non-radioactive methionine. HA-α-rENaC and HA-β-rENaC epitope-tagged constructs were used. The same amount of each in vitro translated rENaC subunit immunopurified and reconstituted in proteoliposomes was then mixed with the same amount of in vitro translated CFTR immunopurified and reconstituted in proteoliposomes, and subjected to coprecipitation. Antibodies directed against nonlabeled protein were used, and the presence of co-precipitated, radioactively labeled protein was detected using autoradiography. The anti-HA and M2 antibodies were used in the following concentrations: 5 μg/ml anti-M2 antibody, 2 μg/ml anti-HA antibody. Rabbit anti-CFTR antibodies were raised against a fusion protein corresponding to the first nucleotide-binding domain of CFTR. All immunoprecipitations, SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were performed as described previously (22Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Leibovitz-15 powdered solution, heated inactivated horse serum, and gentamicin reagent solution were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). One-half strength L-15 medium consisted of 50% concentration of L-15, 15 mmHEPES, 5% horse serum, and 1 mg/ml gentamycin, pH 7.5). Amiloride (RBI, Natick, MA) was prepared as a 5 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide/water (1:1, vol/vol). 8-Chlorophenylthio-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and stocked at 200 mm in water. Forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and palytoxin were from Sigma and stored in dimethyl sulfoxide (10 and 500 mm, respectively) at −200 °C. All other reagents were from Sigma. Current magnitudes were measured by using the Clampfit program (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). The means of more than 100 data points at each voltage (episode) were acquired. The current data recorded from different oocytes were averaged and presented as mean ± S.E., where n stands for the number of oocytes. Significant statistical differences between each group were taken as p < 0.05, tested by one-way ANOVA or paired Student's t test for parallel groups, or from data obtained from identical oocytes. More than 90% of the inward current recorded in oocytes expressing αβγ-rENaC was inhibited by 10 μmamiloride, consistent with the high amiloride sensitivity of αβγ-rENaC (Fig. 1 A). The slightly inward rectified I-V curve and a reversal potential of approximately +10 mV indicated that the amiloride-sensitive current was carried by sodium via exogenously expressed αβγ-rENaC (Fig.1 B). The depolarized resting membrane potential in the oocytes expressing wt αβγ-rENaC resulted from the accumulated intracellular Na+ loading that occurred during the interval between RNA injection and current recording, and was +8.35 ± 1.05 mV (n = 78), significantly greater than that of control oocytes injected with water (−42.5 ± 0.8 mV, n = 45, p < 0.001). In oocytes also expressing CFTR, CFTR current could be elicited by application of a cAMP-elevating mixture (CKT), and had a reversal potential of −25.0 ± 0.9 mV (n = 25; Fig. 1 B). This resting membrane potential was close to that of oocytes injected with water (−37.9 ± 4.1 mV, n = 30, p > 0.05). The sensitivity of CFTR to CKT, the measured reversal potential, and the inability of these currents to be inhibited by 100 μmDIDS (not shown), are all features of the CFTR channel (see Ref.24Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C267-C286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-talk between currents of CFTR and αβγ-rENaC was assessed from identical oocytes co-expressing CFTR and αβγ-rENaC, and compared with a control group expressing CFTR alone. The amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was detected before and during activation of CFTR with CKT, as shown in Fig. 1 A. Fig. 1 C shows that rENaC current was reduced when CFTR was present, and the significant inhibition of αβγ-rENaC by CFTR could be divided into two parts. First, non-activated CFTR inhibited ENaC current by 54% (Fig. 1 C). This current was then further reduced an additional 83% by CFTR activated by CKT (Fig.1 C). Conversely, there was a 6-fold increment in the CFTR-mediated Cl− currents in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and αβγ-rENaC (Fig. 1 D). The magnitude of CFTR current in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and αβγ-rENaC was −8654.2 ± 890.2 nA (n = 84), as compared with −1405.1 ± 358.2 nA in oocytes expressing CFTR alone, (n = 81). To test the specificity of the stimulatory effect of rENaC on CFTR, the effect of rENaC on an endogenous oocyte CaCC was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, this endogenous CaCC, activated by cytosolic injection of 100 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A), was almost completely suppressed in oocytes expressing rENaC (Fig. 2,B-D). The outwardly rectified I-V relationship, with a reversal potential of about −20 mV (Fig. 2 C), was identical to that of the endogenous oocyte CaCC documented previously (25Ji H.L. DuVall M.D. Patton H.K. Satterfield C.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C455-C464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ENaC co-expression had opposite effects on CaCC as compared with CFTR, it is unlikely that the up-regulation of CFTR by rENaC could be due to nonspecific effects. CKT had no effect on the amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 2 E). This result is different than that reported for rENaC following transfection into mammalian cells (7Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M.

Overexpression of rENaC in oocytes produces an increase in cytoplasmic sodium and a depolarization of the resting membrane potential (14Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C455-C464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the possibility that an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration with a concomitant depolarization of the membrane potential could up-regulate CFTR currents. Oocytes expressing CFTR alone were treated with 2 nm palytoxin, a venom that mimics rENaC expression by acting as a Na+ ionophore and inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase (30Ito S. Kadota O.H. Nakazato K.Y. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 75: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The Na+ current induced by palytoxin was activated gradually (Fig.3 A), and the resting membrane potential depolarized to −1.4 ± 0.6 from −27.2 ± 5.9 mV (n = 8). In oocytes expressing CFTR (Fig. 3 B), palytoxin did not significantly affect CFTR current (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained following injection of 100 mm Na+ into CFTR-expressing oocytes (data not shown). We next tested the hypothesis that CFTR can more effectively down-regulate ENaC when conducting Cl−. This was investigated by means of Cl− depletion (oocytes incubated >l h with Cl−-free Ringer's solution as the superfusate). As shown in Fig. 4, CFTR inhibited the rENaC current. However, CFTR current was not inhibited further by CKT in Cl− depleted oocytes. Therefore, we conclude that Cl− does not have to be transported by CFTR in order for CFTR to down-regulate ENaC. Although down-regulation of ENaC by CFTR was first reported more than 10 years ago (see Refs. 1Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 1989; 67: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that there was a physical protein-protein interaction between CFTR and the COOH terminus of α-rENaC (4Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but it has not been confirmed in vivo (11Schreiber R. Hopf A. Mall M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, down-regulation of rENaC by CFTR was observed in planar lipid bilayers, a cell-free model system utilizing purified CFTR and rENaC proteins, implying that cross-regulation of CFTR and rENaC was due to protein-protein interaction (8Ismailov I.I.

N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid root-mean-square 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, found in all animals, plants, and bacteria, catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis whereby malonyl-CoA is formed from acetyl-CoA, Mg2+ATP, and bicarbonate (1.Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As indicted in Scheme FS1, the enzyme is biotin-dependent and the reaction mechanism occurs in two steps. In Escherichia coli, acetyl-CoA carboxylase is not a single entity but rather consists of three polypeptide chains that can be isolated separately and that display distinct functional properties (2.Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These polypeptide chains are referred to as biotin carboxylase (which is Mg2+ATP-dependent), biotin carboxyl carrier protein, and carboxyltransferase. The E. coli biotin carboxylase is known to function as a dimer with each subunit containing 449 amino acid residues (3.Kondo H. Shiratsuchi K. Yoshimoto T. Masuda T. Kitazono A. Tsuru D. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. Tanabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9730-9733Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4.Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first half of the reaction mechanism, as depicted in SchemeFS1, is catalyzed by biotin carboxylase and involves the carboxylation of the ureido ring of the cofactor at the N-1 position. Note that the biotin is not free but rather is covalently attached to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein through an amide linkage between its valeric acid side and an ε-nitrogen of a lysine residue in the carrier protein. The current hypothesis is that the biotin carboxyl carrier protein serves as a “swinging arm” to move this activated form of biotin from biotin carboxylase to the carboxyltransferase, where it reacts with acetyl-CoA to yield the final product, malonyl-CoA. In contrast to the acetyl-CoA carboxylase fromE. coli, the mammalian enzymes contain all three functions on a single polypeptide chain (5.Lane M.D. Moss J. Polakis S.E. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1974; 8: 139-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6.Tanabe T. Wada K. Okazaki T. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In an effort to more fully explore the various structural/functional relationships in the biotin-dependent carboxylases, the three-dimensional x-ray structure of the E. coli enzyme was initially solved in 1994 to a nominal resolution of 2.4 Å (7.Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). While there were no ligands or substrate analogs bound in the active site region, this initial investigation still revealed a number of interesting molecular features. Shown in Fig.1 is a ribbon representation of one subunit of biotin carboxylase. The molecular architecture of the enzyme can be described in terms of three structural motifs referred to as the A-, B-, and C-domains. The A-domain, defined by Met-1 to Ile-103, contains five strands of parallel β-pleated sheet flanked on either side by a total of four α-helices in a similar topological arrangement to that observed in the Rossmann fold. Connecting the A- and B-domains is a helix-turn-helix motif delineated by Ala-107 to Ala-126. The two helices in this motif are bridged by Asp-115 and lie with their helical axes oriented at approximately 90° with respect to one another. As can be seen, the B-domain, formed by Val-131 to Tyr-203, extends away from the main body of the protein and contains a number of disordered surface loops. The C-domain, beginning at Arg-208, is the largest of the three motifs and is dominated by an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. From this initial investigation, the tentative location of the active site was identified and shown to contain Tyr-82, His-209 to Glu-211, His-236 to Glu-241, Glu-276, Ile-287 to Glu-296, and Arg-338. Within recent years it has become apparent that biotin carboxylase belongs to a larger family of proteins characterized by an ATP-grasp fold (8.Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Other enzymes in this family included-alanine:d-alanine ligase, glutathione synthetase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, among others (9.Fan C. Moews P.C. Walsh C.T. Knox J.R. Science. 1994; 266: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10.Yamaguchi H. Kato H. Hata Y. Nishioka T. Kimura A. Oda J. Katsube Y. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The overall chemical transformation catalyzed by the ATP-grasp proteins is the formation of a carbon - nitrogen bond and as such they have been referred to as carboxylate-amine ligases. Members of this superfamily have a common reaction mechanism which requires Mg2+ATP for the formation of an acylphosphate intermediate. Additionally, the ATP-grasp enzymes have a common three domain molecular architecture as described for biotin carboxylase, including the helix-turn-helix motif connecting the first two domains. The nucleotide triphosphate binding pocket is positioned at the interface between the B- and C-domains. Biotin carboxylase from E. coli has served as a paradigm for mechanistic studies of biotin-dependent carboxylation reactions in part because it retains enzymatic activity when isolated from the other components and because it is one of only two presently known biotin-dependent carboxylases that will utilize free biotin as a substrate, the other being β-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (13.Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Hollis D. Fenselau C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6646-6656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the reaction mechanism of biotin carboxylase proceeds through formation of a carboxyphosphate intermediate (14.Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwergel E.E. Lane M.D Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6657-6667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Climent I. Rubio V. Arch. Biochem.

What is not known at the present time, however, is whether the carboxyphosphate intermediate reacts directly with the enolate tautomer of biotin to form carboxybiotin or rather collapses into CO2 and phosphate with subsequent attack of biotin on the CO2. However, for most of the enzymes in the ATP-grasp family (e.g. d-alanine:d-alanine ligase and glutathione synthetase), there is direct attack on the carbonyl group in the acylphosphate intermediate. Since biotin carboxylase is a member of this superfamily, most likely CO2 is not an intermediate in the reaction pathway. Moreover, recent studies on carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase have shown that carboxyphosphate does not decompose within the active site, which is consistent with direct transfer of the carboxyl group (17.Gibson G.E. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Bioorg. Chem. 1998; 26: 255-268Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In an effort to more fully define the molecular architecture of the biotin carboxylase active site, we initiated an x-ray crystallographic analysis of the enzyme complexed with a nucleotide triphosphate. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of biotin carboxylase with bound ATP solved and refined to a nominal resolution of 2.5 Å. For this study, a site-directed mutant protein, in which Glu-288 was replaced with a lysine residue, was constructed. Details of the active site geometry are presented in context of both this E288K protein/ATP model and a previously determined structure in which crystals of native biotin carboxylase had been soaked in a biotin-containing solution (7.Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The native form of biotin carboxylase employed in this investigation was purified according to previously published procedures (7.Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For crystallization trials, the protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Large single crystals were grown by microdialysis against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NaN3 at 4 °C as described in Ref. 7.Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar. The crystals belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 61.7 Å, b = 95.8 Å,c = 180.7 Å, and one dimer per asymmetric unit. For x-ray data collection, the crystals were mounted in quartz capillary tubes. All x-ray data were collected at 4 °C with a Bruker AXS HiStar area detector system. The x-ray source was nickel-filtered CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 mV and 90 mA and equipped with Göbel focusing optics. A complete native x-ray data set to 1.9-Å resolution was collected from a total of nine crystals. These data were processed with the software package SAINT (Bruker AXS Inc.) and internally scaled with XCALIBRE. The x-ray data set was 92.1% complete to 1.9-Å resolution.

Pyruvate kinase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were from Sigma or Aldrich. The glutamic acid at position 288 in biotin carboxylase was replaced with a lysine residue via site-directed mutagenesis according to Ref.19.Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. The pair of internal primers employed to prepare the E288K mutant was as follows (with the base change underlined): 5′-TCTATTTCATCAAAATGAACACCCG-3′ and 3′-AGATAAAGTAGTTTTACTTGTGGGC-5′. The entire gene of the mutant form of biotin carboxylase was sequenced to verify the mutation and to confirm that there were no other changes in the nucleotide sequence. The gene for the E288K mutant was overexpressed inE. coli with a histidine tag attached to the amino terminus. This allowed purification of the protein via nickel affinity chromatography as described elsewhere (19.Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the crystallization studies, the histidine tag was removed from the mutant enzyme by cleavage with thrombin as previously reported (19.Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This procedure leaves behind three residues at the N terminus with the sequence Gly-Ser-His. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by the E288K mutant form of biotin carboxylase was determined spectrophotometrically by coupling the production of ADP to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. No ATP hydrolysis was observed with this mutant protein, in either the presence or absence of biotin after 45 min. Crystals of the E288K mutant protein were grown by the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. For these experiments, 5 μl of protein were mixed with 5 μl of the precipitant solution. The protein sample, at 10 mg/ml, contained 500 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), while the precipitant solution contained 10% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm HEPPS1 (pH 7.5). The crystals belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 81.3 Å, b = 115.5 Å,c = 122.4 Å and one dimer in the asymmetric unit. An x-ray data set to 2.5-Å resolution from a single crystal was collected in a similar manner as described for the native form of biotin carboxylase. The x-ray data set was limited to 2.5-Å resolution due to the inherent diffraction qualities of this crystal form. Relevant intensity statistics are given in TableI. The three-dimensional structure of this E288K protein/ATP complex was solved by molecular replacement with the native enzyme serving as a search model. The B-domain, expected to move upon nucleotide binding, was removed from the search model. To expedite the model-building and refinement processes, the electron densities for both subunits in the asymmetric unit were averaged with the program AVE found in the software package RAVE (20.Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1992: 91-105Google Scholar, 21.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1994: 59-66Google Scholar). An averaged model was built into the electron density, including those residues constituting the B-domain. Subsequently, the averaged model was placed back into the unit cell and refined with the software package, TNT (18.Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The model was adjusted within the unit cell and one final round of least-squares refinement applied. The finalR-factor was 17.2% for all measured x-ray data from 30 to 2.5 Å. R free was 20.3% for 10% of the x-ray data removed from the reflection file. Relevant least-squares refinement statistics can be found in TableII. In subunit I, there were three additional residues (Gly, Ser, and His) included at the N terminus due to the His tag construction. In subunit II, only one additional histidine residue at the N terminus was included in the model. The original structure of biotin carboxylase was solved to a nominal resolution of 2.4 Å (7.Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As reported here, the model has now been refined to 1.9-Å resolution, which has allowed for a better three-dimensional description of both the active site and the solvent structure. Two inorganic phosphate molecules, one per subunit, and 544 waters were included in the final refined model. The average B-value for the waters was 51 Å2 while that for the phosphates was 45 Å2. Electron density corresponding to the region surrounding the bound phosphate in subunit I is displayed in Fig.2 a with the hydrogen bonding pattern between this anion and the protein highlighted in Fig.2 b. Note that both Oε1 and Oε2of Glu-296 lie at 3.0 and 2.6 Å, respectively, from one of the phosphoryl oxygens of the phosphate moiety. This close positioning of the negatively charged phosphate to the carboxylate of Glu-296 argues for a proton shared between the two moieties. There are five direct contacts between the protein and the phosphate, which range in length from 2.7 to 3.1 Å. Three waters also form hydrogen bonds with the phosphoryl oxygens of the phosphate with lengths ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 Å. Both the guanidinium groups of Arg-292 and Arg-338 and the ε-amino group of Lys-238 form a positively charged pocket that is ideally suited for the binding of small, negatively charged molecules. In that one of the substrates for biotin carboxylase is bicarbonate, it is possible that this region of polypeptide chain is responsible for binding this molecular species. Strikingly, phosphate ions have also been observed in similar positions in other ATP-grasp proteins solved in this laboratory, including carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase andN 5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase, both from E. coli (22.Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23.Thoden J.B. Kappock T.J. Stubbe J. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15480-15492Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the model of biotin carboxylase presented here, four amino acid residues adopt multiple conformations: Glu-188 and Asp-419 in subunit I and Asp-135 and His-432 in subunit II. The overall temperature factors for subunits I and II were 37.7 and 41.3 Å2, respectively. Subunit I was somewhat better ordered with respect to the electron density with breaks occurring only at the loops defined by Ser-161 to Met-169 and Ala-189 to Ala-195. In subunit II, the breaks in the electron density occurred at Lys-159 to Met-169 and Ala-187 to Tyr-199 and many residues in the B-domain had to be modeled as alanines. The last observable residues in subunits I and II are Leu-446 and Glu-448, respectively. The only significant outliers in the Ramachandran plot occur at Phe-84 (φ = 46o, ψ = −116o) and Ala-226 (φ = 53 o, ψ = −158o) in both subunits. The electron density in these regions is unambiguous. Phe-84 is located within a tight turn that connects the fourth β-strand of the A-domain to an α-helix, while Ala-226 is positioned in the first β-strand of the C-domain. Partly as a result of crystalline packing, the B-domain of the biotin carboxylase subunit is splayed significantly away from the main body of the enzyme. The overall B-values for all backbone atoms of the A-, B-, and C-domains in subunit I are 31, 56, and 28 Å2, respectively. These domains in subunit II show comparable B-values of 34, 72, and 38 Å2. While caution must be applied in interpreting temperature factors, clearly the combination of residues forming the B-domains of biotin carboxylase demonstrate conformational flexibility, which may be important for the proper functioning of the enzyme. The original structure of biotin carboxylase, albeit without any bound nucleotides to unambiguously define the active site, was significant in that it allowed the three-dimensional architecture of the enzyme to be defined. Interestingly, all attempts to soak crystals in nucleotide analogs cracked the crystals within minutes (7.Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization attempts of biotin carboxylase with nucleotide analogs were also unsuccessful. In an effort to more fully characterize the active site of this ATP-grasp enzyme, a site-directed mutant protein in which Glu-288 was replaced with a lysine residue was prepared. While this amino acid substitution completely abolished the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze ATP, it allowed crystals of biotin carboxylase to be grown in the presence of ATP. As such, this structure represents the first model for any ATP-grasp protein with ATP bound in the active site rather than a nucleotide analog such as AMPPNP. Electron density corresponding to the ATP moiety is shown in Fig.3. Unlike that observed for carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, for example, there are no bound magnesium ions. Rather, the ε-amino group of Lys-288 is located in a position normally occupied by such cations, i.e. wedged between β- and γ-phosphoryl oxygens. In native biotin carboxylase, Glu-288 might serve as a ligand to one of the magnesium ions known to be important for catalysis. Indeed, in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, Glu-299, the structural counterpart of Glu-288 in biotin carboxylase, serves as a bidentate ligand to one of the metals wedged between the β- and γ-phosphoryl oxygens (24.Thoden J.B. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2347-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Likewise, Glu-841, in the second ATP binding site of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, functions as a bidentate ligand to the nucleotide-bound metal. A close-up view of the ATP binding pocket in biotin carboxylase is displayed in Fig. 4 a, and a schematic of the hydrogen bonding pattern between the protein and the ligand is given in Fig. 4 b. In that the structure of the E288K protein/ATP complex was solved to 2.5-Å resolution, the actual hydrogen bonding pattern may change somewhat when higher resolution x-ray data are eventually obtained. These crystals were quite difficult to grow, and a search for a more promising crystal form is under way. Even in light of this caveat, however, this complex has provided significant insight into nucleotide binding to biotin carboxylase. Most of the binding pocket is formed by residues located in the B- and C-domains. Lys-116, which is located in the connecting region between the A- and B-domains, provides a key electrostatic interaction with one of the α-phosphoryl oxygens of the ATP. When Lys-116 is changed to a glutamine, the K m for ATP increases by 57-fold. 2V. M. Sloane and G. L. Waldrop, unpublished results. Likewise, Nε2 of His-236 lies within hydrogen bonding distance to both the β,γ-bridging oxygen and one of the γ-phosphoryl oxygens. From Fig. 4 a, it can be seen that the adenine portion of the nucleotide is wedged up into a loop defined by Glu-201 to Leu-204. The aromatic side chain of Tyr-203 forms an edge-on stacking interaction with the purine ring of ATP. In carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the nucleotide ribose are anchored to the protein via hydrogen bonding to the side chain carboxylate of Glu-215 (or Glu-761 in the second half of the large subunit). The topologically equivalent residue in biotin carboxylase is His-209, which is located ∼4 Å from the ribose hydroxyl groups. Since the structure reported here is that of a site-directed mutant protein, it is possible that the ATP has been shifted somewhat from its normal binding position in the active site. Consequently, it can be speculated that in the native protein, His-209 plays a role in the binding of the nucleotide to biotin carboxylase. Interestingly, substitution of His-209 with an alanine residue increases the K m for free biotin by about 10-fold and the K m for ATP by approximately 70-fold. 3C. Z. Blanchard and G. L. Waldrop, unpublished results. Two peptidic NH groups, provided by Gly-165 and Gly-166 of the B-domain, participate in hydrogen bonds with the phosphoryl oxygens of the nucleotide as indicated in Fig. 4 b. These residues are disordered in the model for native biotin carboxylase. The structurally equivalent residues in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, namely Gly-721 and Gly-722 in the second half of the large subunit, act as a trigger for closure of the B-domain upon nucleotide binding (24.Thoden J.B. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2347-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Note that the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP is located at approximately 8 Å from where the inorganic phosphate was observed binding in native biotin carboxylase. The movement of the B-domain upon ATP binding to biotin carboxylase is extensive, as can be seen in Fig. 5. There is an overall rotation of ∼45o of the B-domain relative to the A- and C-motifs, which results in some atoms moving by more than 8 Å. The largest shifts begin at Pro-132 and continue to Leu-204 whose aliphatic side chain abuts one face of the adenine ring of ATP. The conformational flexibility of the B-domain is not unexpected, in that 15% of the residues found in the region defined by Pro-132 to Leu-204 are glycine residues and there is stretch of five glycines in tandem beginning at Gly-162. Indeed, the B-domains (between the apo- and liganded forms of biotin carboxylase) superimpose with an r.m.s. value of 12.2 Å, while the A- and C-domains are quite similar with r.m.s. deviations of 0.33 and 0.54 Å, respectively, for all backbone atoms. Approximately 85% of the ATP surface area is buried upon binding to biotin carboxylase. Of the various members of the ATP-grasp superfamily whose three-dimensional structures are now known, the architecture of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase appears to be the most closely related to that of biotin carboxylase. The large subunit of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase contains two Mg+2ATP binding sites formed by Met-1 to Glu-403 and Asn-554 to Asn-936, respectively (24.Thoden J.B. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2347-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These two regions of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase are remarkably similar and correspond with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.93 Å for 1076 structurally equivalent backbone atoms. Fig.6 shows a comparison of the polypeptide chain backbones for biotin carboxylase and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (Met-1 to Glu-403). For this comparison, the A-, B-, and C-domains were fitted separately. The two A-domains for carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase and biotin carboxylase superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.6 Å for 97 structurally equivalent α-carbons. There are three regions in the A-domains where the two polypeptide chains significantly deviate from one another. The first region occurs at Arg-10 in biotin carboxylase, where there is an 11-residue insertion in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (beginning at Ala-15). The second and third regions occur at Ser-33 and Gly-52, where there are 2- and 8-residue insertions in biotin carboxylase, respectively, relative to carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase at Ser-49 and Pro-68. A comparison of the B-domains reveals that there is only one insertion in biotin carboxylase relative to carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. This 4-residue insertion occurs at Ala-189 in biotin carboxylase and Ser-199 in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. Accordingly, the polypeptide chains for the B-domains of biotin carboxylase and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase superimpose with an r.m.s. value of 2.0 Å for 63 structurally equivalent α-carbons. The C-domains of biotin carboxylase and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase correspond with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.6 Å for 116 structurally equivalent α-carbons. Interestingly, the last 40 residues of biotin carboxylase, which fold into one β-strand and three α-helices, have no structural counterparts in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. There are two small insertions in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase at Asn-236 and Asn-289, which correspond to the regions beginning at Cys-230 and Glu-280 in biotin carboxylase. Additionally, there is an 11-residue insertion in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase relative to biotin carboxylase (beginning at Leu-332 in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase and Leu-321 in biotin carboxylase). By far, the most significant deviation in the polypeptide chains occurs at Ala-341 in biotin carboxylase (Asn-363 in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase), where there is a 26-residue insertion in biotin carboxylase. In the initial structural investigation of biotin carboxylase, native apo-crystals were soaked in a saturated solution of Ag+/biotin in an attempt to identify the active site region of the enzyme (7.Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). While the crystals only diffracted to 3.0-Å resolution and the silver ion dissociated from the complex, it was possible to unambiguously orient the biotin into the difference electron density map due to the presence of the sulfur in the tetrahydrothiophene ring of the cofactor. Note that the inorganic phosphate ion observed in the original structure of biotin carboxylase was displaced upon biotin binding. Now that the structure of biotin carboxylase in its closed form is known, it has been possible to examine the relative orientations of biotin and ATP in the active site region of the enzyme as shown in Fig.7. This model was constructed by simply superimposing the C-domain of the native biotin carboxylase with bound biotin (open form) onto the C-domain of the E288K mutant protein (closed form). Approximately 77% of the biotin is buried in this model. While the reaction mechanism of biotin carboxylase is still not completely understood, it can be envisioned to occur as outlined in Scheme FS2. According to this scheme, the carboxylation of biotin requires two key structural elements: 1) a base for the abstraction of the proton from N-1′ of the ureido ring; and 2) amino acid residues responsible for stabilization of the enolate anion. As shown in Fig. 7, the γ-phosphate of ATP lies adjacent to the 1′ nitrogen of biotin and both the side chains of Glu-276 and Lys-288 are positioned near the ureido ring. In the native form of biotin carboxylase, Lys-288 is a glutamate residue, and on the basis of homology with carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, probably serves as a ligand to one of the required magnesium ions. Glu-276 probably does not function as the base as well in light of recent site-directed mutatgenesis experiments, where it was replaced with a glutamine. Although the catalytic activity of this mutant protein was reduced from wild-type, there was still a one to one ratio of formation of ADP to carboxybiotin.3 From the model in Fig. 7, it is not presently clear what amino acid residues provide hydrogen bonds to the proposed enolate anion. In an effort to more fully define the active site geometry of biotin carboxylase, co-crystallization studies of the E288K protein with various nucleotides and biotin are in progress. Additional crystallization experiments are under way with the native enzyme, AMPPNP, and various carboxyphosphate intermediate analogs as well. We thank Dr. W. W. Cleland for insightful discussions and for critically reading this manuscript."

In an attempt to decipher its role, we used AffymetrixTM DNA chips to investigate the gene expression profile of the promyelocytic cells HL-60 transfected with the CB2 receptor and activated with the cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940. Agonist exposure of these cells led to an activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and a receptor desensitization, indicating a functional coupling of the transfected receptors. At the genomic level, activation of the CB2 receptors induced an up-regulation of nine genes involved in cytokine synthesis, regulation of transcription, and cell differentiation. A majority of them are under the control of the transcription factor NF-κB, whose nuclear translocation was demonstrated. Many features of the transcriptional events, reported here for the first time, appeared to be related to an activation of a cell differentiation program, suggesting that CB2 receptors could play a role in the initialization of cell maturation. Moreover, we showed that CB2-activated wild-type HL-60 cells developed properties usually found in host defense effector cells such as an enhanced release of chemotactic cytokines and an increased motility, characteristic of more mature cells of the granulocytic-monocytic lineage.

The central receptor CB1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, whereas the peripheral receptor CB2 is mainly expressed on cells of immune origin (5.Kaminski N.E. Abood M.E. Kessler F.K. Martin B.R. Schatz A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 736-742PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Galiègue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D Carrière D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur.

Biochem. 1996; 214: 173-180Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition to psychotropic effects mediated by the central receptor, many reports have described a cannabinoid-induced modulation of immune functions, which could be attributed to the peripheral receptor subtype. With the exception of few examples reporting stimulating effects (8.Derocq J.-M. Ségui M. Marchand J. Le Fur G. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 9.Zhu W. Newton C. Daaka Y. Friedman H. Klein T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Life Sci. 1994; 54: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), most of the studies showed immunosupressive properties of cannabinoids in very different areas of the immunity, including humoral and cellular responses as well as cytokine production (11.Luo Y.D. Patel M.K. Wiederhold M.D. Ou D.W. Int. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 14: 49-56Google Scholar, 12.Schwartz H. Blanco F.J. Lotz M. J.

However many of these studies were conducted in the micromolar range higher than that required for receptor binding and often without controlling the specificity of the observed effects. As high concentrations of cannabinoids may induce nonspecific membrane perturbations (14.Lynn A.B. Herkenham M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1612-1623PubMed Google Scholar), the question of the receptor specificity of the widespread suppressive effects reported so far is raised. Therefore, despite the characterization of the CB2 receptors on the immune cells (6.Galiègue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D Carrière D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P.

Ther. 1998; 284: 644-650PubMed Google Scholar), the function of CB2 receptors in the immune system is still elusive.In the present paper, to better define the complex involvement of this receptor in the immune functions, we used the recently developed DNA microarray technology to study the gene expression profile induced through the specific activation of the CB2 receptor. In a preceding study (22.Jbilo O. Derocq J.-M. Ségui M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we show that a stimulation of the CB2 receptor in HL-60 cells was able to induce the expression of the two chemokines IL-81 and MCP-1. In this study, using DNA microarrays allowing the differential evaluation of thousands of genes at the same time, we went a step further by providing a more complete gene expression profile specifically induced via the CB2 receptors in HL-60 cells. As a source of hematopoietic cells and myelomonocytic committed progenitors, these cells constitute a relevant model for the analysis of cell differentiation and the study of development of the immune effector functions. Moreover these cells offer the advantage of expressing the CB2 receptors only, excluding CB1 interferences. To compensate for the low density of CB2 receptors and to amplify the cannabinoid-induced effects, the receptor was overexpressed by transfection.Using this approach, we demonstrated for the first time that nanomolar concentrations of the cannabinoid ligand CP 55,940 induced the expression of factors mainly involved in gene transcription and cell differentiation processes as well as in the production of cytokines. Many of the genes shown to be regulated via the CB2 receptor in HL-60 cells have not been previously described as associated with the cannabinoid process. This specific gene expression profile led us to undertake functional studies that corroborated some of the genomic events shown mediated through the CB2 receptors and suggested a role for this receptor in inducing mechanisms of the cell differentiation.DISCUSSIONAlthough some studies suggested that the CB2 receptor is specifically involved in the cannabinoid-induced immunomodulating effects (6.Galiègue S.

Bouaboula M. Calandra B. Portier M. Shire D. Brelière J.-C. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 644-650PubMed Google Scholar), many reports dealing with immunomodulatory effects of cannabinoids have little meaning since most of the data reported were obtained using ligand concentrations outside the physiological range and probably via receptor-independent pathways (44.Klein T.W. Newton C. Zhu W. Daaka Y. Friedman H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 209: 205-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the exact function of this receptor is still a matter of conjecture. The recently described cDNA microarray or DNA chip technology allows expression monitoring of thousands of genes simultaneously and provides a framework for identifying genes as well as changes in their activity (45.Watson A. Mazumder A. Stewart M. Balasubramanian S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This technology is particularly well suited for analyzing the gene expression profile induced by the activation of receptors whose function is still poorly understood, as is the case for the peripheral cannabinoid receptor CB2 expressed on immune cells.Using this powerful tool, we investigated here the effect of nanomolar concentrations of a specific cannabinoid ligand on the transcriptional program induced in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. This cell line, which lacks central CB1 receptors, made it possible to focus specifically on the peripheral receptor subtype CB2, which was further overexpressed by transfection in order to amplify an eventual cannabinoid-induced effect on gene modulation. In addition, this cell line, which is a derivative of committed progenitors of the granulocytic/monocytic lineage (46.Gallagher R. Collins S. Trujillo J. Mc Credie K. Ahearn M. Tsai S. Metzgar R. Aulakh G. Ting R. Rucetti F. Gallo R. Blood. 1979; 54: 713-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also gave us the opportunity to study a possible influence on both cell differentiation and development of the immune functions.In a previous study using a similar approach based on hybridization on arrays containing 588 human cDNAs, we already reported a specific CB2-mediated up-regulation of two genes encoding MCP-1 and IL-8 chemokines (22.Jbilo O. Derocq J.-M. Ségui M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this report, using the recently developed microarrays spotted with several thousands of genes, we were able to perform a much more overall analysis of the modulated genes and to go deeper into the possible commitment of CB2 receptors on the immune functions. Our study showed that 10 genes were significantly and reproducibly modulated after activation of the CB2 receptor, and among them, 9 were up-regulated. Except the two chemokine genes mentioned above, none of the genes described here has already been reported as associated with CB2 receptor activation.Several genes involved in cell differentiation or encoding “markers” of cell maturation were strongly up-regulated such asjunB, aldolase C, or the cytokinesIL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1β,TNF-α, and the TNF-α-inducible protein A20. Most of these genes induced through activation of the CB2 receptor in the undifferentiated HL-60 cell line have been reported in the literature to be up-regulated during the differentiation process of myeloid cells. For instance, BTG2 is a major regulator of growth control and differentiation and a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation (33.Rouault J.-P. Prevot D. Berthet C. Birot A.-M. Billaud M. Magaud J.-P.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1432-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In addition, we showed that the transduction signals following CB2 stimulation were in keeping with part of the events observed at the transcriptional level. Western blot studies clearly demonstrated that CB2 receptors, once activated, as demonstrated by their agonist-specific phosphorylation status, transduced the expression of activated isoforms of MAP kinases and the modulation of the IκB-α protein, a major cytoplasmic regulator of the NF-κB activity. We had already reported the major involvement of the MAP kinase network in gene induction associated with the stimulation of CB2 receptors (7.Bouaboula M. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Carayon P. Carillon C. Delpech B. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 214: 173-180Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this study, the finding of a mobilization of the NF-κB axis, observed either indirectly through the transcriptional and translational modulation of its regulator IκB or directly through the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, brings new insights in the signaling pathway and the possible functions of the peripheral cannabinoid receptor. The pleiotropic transcription factor NF-κB plays a major role in gene regulation during cell differentiation and immunoinflammatory reactions (48.Page S. Fisher C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). NF-κB regulatory sequences have been found in promoters or enhancers of genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8, and MCP-1 (39.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). The mobilization of this pivotal transcription factor was therefore consistent with the expression of genes that encode the cytokines mentioned above and whose expression depends on the nuclear translocation of NF-κB after degradation of Iκ-B. Regulation of NF-κB is complex, and multiple kinases are involved, but it is likely that the activation of the MAP kinase pathway observed here took part in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB as already reported (49.Swantek J.L. Christerson L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 11667-11671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The transductional and transcriptional events observed in our model are summarized in Fig. 9, in which the central role of the NF-κB axis is highlighted by the fact that 70% of the genes shown to be up-regulated are under the control of this transcription factor. Moreover, most of them are reported in the literature to be associated with myeloid cell differentiation. This is the first time that an activation of a NF-κB axis is demonstrated following a specific CB2 receptor-mediated activation. This represents an important finding, considering the major role that NF-κB plays in the gene regulation during cell differentiation and immunoinflammatory reactions (48.Page S. Fisher C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11611-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Taken together, the transcription program elicited by the activation of the peripheral CB receptor indicated a possible role for this receptor in the initialization of a cell maturation process. This notion was strengthened at a translational level, where the protein expression of the transcribed cytokines was effectively found also to be enhanced in the cell culture supernatants, evidence that activation via the CB2 receptor led to an enhanced expression of important effectors involved in immune and inflammatory responses. This major response was not restricted to the CB2-overexpressing cells but was also observed in normal HL-60 cells, ruling out artifactual phenomena due to transfection. Moreover, the receptor specificity of this response was demonstrated by the blockade of the induced effects by the CB2 receptor-antagonist SR 144528 (21.Rinaldi-Carmona M. Barth F. Millan J. Derocq J.-M. Casellas P. Congy C. Oustric D. Sarran M. Bouaboula M. Calandra B. Portier M. Shire D. Brelière J.-C. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 644-650PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, neither anandamide nor 2-arachidonyl glycerol, two putative ligands with binding properties for both cannabinoid receptors subtypes (17.Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2794-2801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), were effective in our model, suggesting that another high affinity CB2-restricted endogenous ligand mimicking the effect of the agonist CP 55,940 remains to be identified.Other evidence of the initialization of a differentiation process was the surprising CB2-mediated cell migration as a likely consequence of cytoskeletal reorganization, which is a feature of myelocytic cell lines undergoing differentiation (43.Cross A.K. Richardson V. Ali S.A. Palmer I. Taub D.D. Rees R.C. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is the first time that a cannabinoid ligand was shown to activate cell motility via a specific peripheral receptor-mediated process. The cell migration induced by the cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 was a chemokinetic event and not a real directional chemotactic migration as observed with “professional” chemotactic factors such as C5a or chemokines. A possible action of the cannabinoid agonist is to trigger mechanisms of cell locomotion that could further facilitate the subsequent action of true chemotactic agents. This phenomenon is observed for example with IL-1β, which also induces chemokinesis and not chemotactism and whose chemokinetic effects favor chemokine-induced migration of granulocytes through endothelium and epithelium (50.Casale T.B. Carolan E.J. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It remains to be explored whether a similar “priming” effect of cannabinoid ligands on chemotaxis can also be obtained and what kind of cytoskeletal rearrangements may be involved. Finally, the dramatic down-regulation of CB2 receptor mRNAs during the course of differentiation induced by Me2SO was additional indirect evidence of the possible commitment of CB2 receptors in the initialization of a differentiation program, suggesting that the involvement of CB2 receptors could be significant at the initial stage of differentiation to engage the process and becomes marginal once the terminal differentiation is fully achieved. In line with this assumption was the observation that in contrast to their undifferentiated counterparts, mature HL-60 became resistant to the CB2-mediated effect on chemokine production and cell migration.However, stimulation of CB2 receptors did not lead to a complete maturation since, in our hands, CB2-stimulated normal or -transfected cells failed to adhere, to stop proliferating, or to up-regulate cell surface markers such as chemokine receptors, characteristics of cells that have reached full functional maturity (not shown) (51.Tiffany H.L. Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1385-1392PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we showed for the first time that activation through the peripheral cannabinoid receptors induced in HL-60 cells an intermediate stage of maturation evidenced by the genomic up-regulation of factors involved in cell differentiation, an enhanced synthesis of chemotactic proteins, and an increased locomotion, key events in leukocyte trafficking and the inflammatory response (52.Sanchez-Madrid F. Del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CB2 receptors could induce conditions that facilitate the transition of HL-60 cells to a more mature monocytic/granulocytic phenotype. More experiments are needed, however, in different cell lines at different stages of maturation to clarify the influence of CB2 receptors in cell differentiation and to measure their possible implications on the physiology of human hematopoietic progenitors.Further findings obtained from models similar to the one depicted here that involve an exhaustive study of the gene expression profile of treated cells using DNA microarrays and a confirmation of the transcriptional events at different functional levels may be very useful to answer this important issue. Two G-protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains have been identified as cannabinoid receptors and are referred to as CB1 and CB2 (1.Devane W.A. Dyzarz III, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvins L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I.

Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The central receptor CB1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, whereas the peripheral receptor CB2 is mainly expressed on cells of immune origin (5.Kaminski N.E. Abood M.E. Kessler F.K. Martin B.R. Schatz A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 736-742PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Galiègue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D Carrière D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur.

Biochem. 1996; 214: 173-180Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition to psychotropic effects mediated by the central receptor, many reports have described a cannabinoid-induced modulation of immune functions, which could be attributed to the peripheral receptor subtype. With the exception of few examples reporting stimulating effects (8.Derocq J.-M. Ségui M. Marchand J. Le Fur G. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 9.Zhu W. Newton C. Daaka Y. Friedman H. Klein T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Life Sci. 1994; 54: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), most of the studies showed immunosupressive properties of cannabinoids in very different areas of the immunity, including humoral and cellular responses as well as cytokine production (11.Luo Y.D. Patel M.K. Wiederhold M.D. Ou D.W. Int. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 14: 49-56Google Scholar, 12.Schwartz H. Blanco F.J. Lotz M. J.

However many of these studies were conducted in the micromolar range higher than that required for receptor binding and often without controlling the specificity of the observed effects. As high concentrations of cannabinoids may induce nonspecific membrane perturbations (14.Lynn A.B. Herkenham M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1612-1623PubMed Google Scholar), the question of the receptor specificity of the widespread suppressive effects reported so far is raised. Therefore, despite the characterization of the CB2 receptors on the immune cells (6.Galiègue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D Carrière D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P.

In the present paper, to better define the complex involvement of this receptor in the immune functions, we used the recently developed DNA microarray technology to study the gene expression profile induced through the specific activation of the CB2 receptor. In a preceding study (22.Jbilo O. Derocq J.-M. Ségui M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we show that a stimulation of the CB2 receptor in HL-60 cells was able to induce the expression of the two chemokines IL-81 and MCP-1. In this study, using DNA microarrays allowing the differential evaluation of thousands of genes at the same time, we went a step further by providing a more complete gene expression profile specifically induced via the CB2 receptors in HL-60 cells.

Using dichlorofluorescin, a short-term increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) was demonstrated, suggesting that their excessive formation could signal LSU down-regulation. A decrease in LSU synthesis occurred at LL in the presence of methyl viologen and was prevented at HL by ascorbate. Interfering with D1 function by mutations or by incubation with DCMU prevented the increase in ROS formation at HL and the concomitant down-regulation of LSU synthesis. If the electron transport was blocked further downstream, by mutation in the cytochromeb 6/f or by incubation with 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone, ROS formation increased, and LSU synthesis ceased. The elevation of ROS occurred concurrently with a change in the redox state of the glutathione pool, which shifted toward its oxidized form immediately after the transfer to HL and returned to its original value after 6 h. The decrease in the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio at HL was prevented by ascorbate and could be induced at LL by methyl viologen. We suggest that excess ROS mediate a decrease in the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio that in turn signals the translational arrest of the rbcL transcript.

The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 295-348Crossref Google Scholar). Most plants and algae have the capacity to recover from light stress through photoacclimation, which normally involves a reduction in either the number or size of the light harvesting complexes and increased synthesis of the photodamaged D1, the core protein of photosystem II (PSII) (4.Anderson J.M. Osmond C.B. Shade-Sun Responses: Compromises between Acclimation and Photoinhibition. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 1-38Google Scholar, 5.Falkowski P. Laroche J. J. Phycol. 1991; 27: 8-14Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Excess light energy generates reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 which in turn lead to the induction of antioxidant photoprotective mechanisms enabling the plant to combat the danger posed by the presence of ROS. Ribulose biphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) is the key enzyme in carbon assimilation during photosynthesis. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and in land plants the enzyme is composed of eight large subunits (LSU) encoded by the chloroplast rbcL gene and eight small subunits encoded by the nuclear rbcS gene family (6.Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Phusiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-49Crossref Google Scholar, 7.Gutteridge S. Gatenby A.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Assembly of the Rubisco holoenzyme is driven by the chloroplast Cpn60 and Cpn10, encoded by groEL andgroES, respectively. Previously we observed unique and opposite patterns for translational regulation of the chloroplast LSU and D1 polypeptides in response to changes in light intensity. Within minutes of shifting cells of C. reinhardtii from low light to higher light intensities, LSU synthesis was down-regulated dramatically for a period that did not exceed 4–6 h, whereas that of D1 was gradually up-regulated. Translation of other genes was hardly affected, including photosynthesis-related genes such as the chloroplast encoded ATPase β-subunit, the nuclear encoded small subunit of Rubisco (small subunits), or nonphotosynthetic genes, such as tubulin. The observed changes in D1 and LSU synthesis could not be correlated with changes in the steady state levels of their corresponding mRNAs, implying that translational regulation was involved. Primer extension analysis of rbcL mRNA revealed two transcripts that differed in their 5′ ends and in their abundance at LL and after transfer to HL. The appearance of the longer transcript correlated with the down-regulation in LSU synthesis, but its involvement in arresting LSU translation was unresolved. These several distinct effects of temporary light stress were correlated with a rapid, sustained increase in the reduction state of QA, a transient decline in the photosynthetic efficiency, a less rapid drop in total chlorophyll content, and a delay in cell division (8.Shapira M. Lers A. Heifetz P. Irihimoritch V. Osmond B.C. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This study attempts to decipher the mechanism that controls translation of LSU and signals the immediate and short-term down-regulation observed upon transferring low light grown C. reinhardtiicells to higher light intensities. We propose that modulation of the glutathione redox potential by changes in the level of ROS regulate the synthesis of Rubisco LSU in the chloroplast. C. reinhardtiiwild type strain CC-125 was used in all experiments. Cultures in High Salt Reduced Sulfate (HSRS) (300 ml) (9.Harris E.H. Burkhart B.D. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.C. Genetics. 1989; 123: 281-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown with 5% CO2 bubbling and constant rotary shaking at 22 °C. Cultures were illuminated with low light (LL; 70 μmol m−2 s−1) using cool white fluorescent lamps. LL grown cells were adapted for low irradiance and were not permitted to attain densities greater that 0.2–0.3 A 750. The D1 mutant strains were CC-741 (FUD7), a D1 deletion mutant, and CC-3376 (A251R*), which carries a point mutation in D1 (10.Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cytochrome b 6/f-deficient mutant was CC-2910 (F2D8) (11.Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In vivo labeling of plastid and nuclear encoded proteins with [35S]H2SO4 was performed essentially as described (12.Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Cells were grown under LL in HSRS (13.Schmidt R.J. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), until their biomassA 750 reached 0.2–0.3. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation for 5 min (4500 × g, 20 °C) and resuspended at 0.4 A 750 in minimal medium lacking sulfate (HS-S; Ref. 13.Schmidt R.J. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and containing 10 mmbicarbonate to ensure carbon availability for photosynthesis. The cells were equilibrated for 1 h under LL in HS-S. Aliquots (4 ml) of the HS-S cell suspension were placed in 30-ml Corex tubes containing magnetic stirring bars and illuminated at LL or at high light (HL; 700 μmol m−2 s−1) for the designated time periods. Anisomycin (Sigma) was then added to a concentration of 250 μg ml−1 for 15 min to reduce labeling of cytoplasmic proteins (14.Chua N.-H. Gillham N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). [35S]H2SO4 (125 μCi; carrier free; NEN Life Science Products) was then added to each aliquot of cells for additional 15 min. To terminate labeling, 3 ml of the cell aliquot were added rapidly to 10 ml of ice-cold acetone incubated on ice for 1–2 h and centrifuged for 10 min, and the protein pellets were dried. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of H2O and 100 μl of denaturing solution (4% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), briefly vortexed, and boiled for 5 min. Incorporation of the radiolabel was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the protein content was determined with the BCA reagent (Pierce). Samples containing equal protein quantities were loaded and verified by Coomassie staining. The gels were dried, exposed to XAR5 film (Kodak), and also analyzed by a Fuji phosphorimager. Wild type cells were grown photoautotrophically and processed for labeling as described above. Following transfer to HS-S for 1 h, the cells were incubated at LL or at HL in the presence of DCMU (10−7m), DBMIB (10−6m), or ascorbic acid (5 and 10 mm) for 2 h and then labeled as described for wild type cells. Following cell harvest, proteins were extracted and analyzed as described above. Labeling of LSU and D1 was evaluated by phosphorimaging. The nonphotosynthetic mutant strains CC-741 (FUD7), CC-3376 (A251R*), and CC-2910 (F2D8) were grown heterotrophically in TAP medium (9.Harris E.H. Burkhart B.D. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.C. Genetics. 1989; 123: 281-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under LL conditions to early log phase. Acetate was depleted by transfer of the cells to minimal growth conditions (HSRS/5% CO2) 16 h before transfer to HL. The cells were then resuspended in HS-S for 1 h and transferred to LL and HL for 2.5 h. Labeling and SDS-PAGE analysis were performed as described for wild type cells. Early log cells grown photoautotrophically at LL on HSRS with bubbling of 5% CO2. Aliquots (4 ml) were transferred to HS-S medium for 1 h at LL in presence of MeV (10−6, 6 × 10−6, and 10−5m) for 45 min and radiolabeled. Early log cells grown photoautotrophically on minimal medium with 5% CO2 at LL were transferred to HS-S for 1 h. A sample of the cell suspension (10 ml) was placed in 30-ml Corex tubes containing magnetic stirring bars and illuminated with LL or HL irradiance. Samples (2 ml) from LL and HL were removed after 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 h and added to 8 ml of loading buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl) containing 0.05 mmDCFH (5 μl from a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO; Ref. 15.Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The samples were maintained for 20 min in the dark, and relative fluorescence was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B Spectrofluorometer, set at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm with a slit width of 7.5 nm. DCF fluorescence at LL and after the shift to HL was performed in wild type CC-125 and in the nonphotosynthetic mutants (CC-741, CC-3376, and CC-2910) as well as in wild type cells in the presence of DCMU (10−7m), DBMIB (10−6m), and ascorbic acid (10 mm). Measurement of DCF fluorescence at LL in the presence of MeV (10−4–10−6m) was performed with samples that were collected after 0.5 and 1.5 h. Fluorometry measurements were performed in triplicate and expressed as relative fluorescence units. GSH and GSSG were measured using a modified method for glutathione measurement in microtiter plates (16.Anderson M.E.

Cells were grown under LL in HSRS up to a density of 0.2–0.3 A 750, harvested by centrifugation for 5 min (4500 × g, 20 °C), and resuspended at a density of 0.4 A 750 in HS-S. Cultures were then illuminated at LL and at HL for different time periods, and cell samples (12 ml) were removed, washed once in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.0), and centrifuged. The wet weight of the washed cell pellet was measured, and 5% sulfosalicylic acid (Sigma) was added, 150 μl/50 mg pellet. The mixture was agitated on a Vortex mixer and stored at −70 °C until their analysis, at which time the cells were thawed, and the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The supernatant was collected, and samples of 100 μl were diluted 1:1 with distilled water and distributed into two aliquots, for individually measuring GSSG and total glutathione. To conjugate GSH, 2-vinylpyridine (Fluka) was added to one of the aliquots to a final concentration of 0.35 m. The mixture was neutralized to pH 6.7–7 with triethanolamine (diluted 1:2 with double distilled H2O). GSSG concentrations in these extracts were determined using the enzymatic recycling assay (16.Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar, 17.Baker M.A. Cerniglia G.J. Zaman A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) involving the color development at 412 nm of 0.15 mm 5,5-dithiobis 2-nitro-benzoic acid (Sigma) in the presence of 0.2 mmNADPH and 1 unit ml−1 of GSH reductase (Fluka). Total glutathione (GSH and GSSG) concentrations were determined in the second aliquot using the same assay without adding 2-vinylpyridine. GSSG standards (Calbiochem) were used for calibration, and all measurements were performed in triplicate. GSH and GSSG were measured also in cells incubated with ascorbic acid at LL and at HL and in cells incubated with MeV at LL. To test whether the redox state of specific components along the electron transport chain affected the down-regulation of LSU, labeling experiments of wild type cells at LL and after transfer to HL were performed in the presence of herbicides that inhibit the electron transfer at different sites along the electron transfer chain. DCMU inhibits the oxidation of the plastoquinone pool, and DBMIB reduces its oxidation by competitively binding to cytochromeb 6/f complex. Wild type C. reinhardtii cells were labeled at LL and after transfer to HL (2 h) in the presence of DCMU (10−7m) and DBMIB (10−6m), which were added when the cells were transferred to HL. Although synthesis of LSU decreased 2-fold in control cells shifted to HL, it was almost unaffected in the presence of DCMU (Fig. 1 A). However, addition of DBMIB did not prevent the down-regulation of LSU synthesis after transfer from LL to HL (Fig. 1 B). In addition, LSU synthesis decreased already at LL in the presence of DBMIB (10−6m). To complement the experiments using herbicides, C. reinhardtii mutants in which D1 was completely absent (FUD-7) or inactivated by a point mutation (A251R*), and a mutant defective in cytochrome b 6/f (F2D8) were labeled at LL and after shifting to HL (2 h). The FUD-7 mutant does not synthesize any D1 and is thus deficient of functional PSII. In the D1 mutant A251R*, Ala at position 251 was substituted with Arg. Ala251 is located in the quinone binding loop connecting the IV–V helices of D1 (10.Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This mutation does not alter the size (32 kDa) or amount of the D1 protein. The mutant synthesizes D1 up to 80% of its level in wild type when grown under HL but has a nonphotosynthetic phenotype because electron transfer between QA and QB is completely blocked (10.Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Labeling experiments of both D1 mutants indicate that in the absence of a functional D1, synthesis of LSU is unaffected by shifting the cells from LL to HL (Fig.2, B and C). However, inactivation of cytochromeb 6/f in the mutant strain F2D8 did not prevent the down-regulation of LSU synthesis (Fig.2 D). The effect of mutations in the photosynthetic electron carriers that prevent oxidation or reduction of the plastoquinone (Fig. 2) corroborated with that of the herbicides (Fig. 1). In the presence of DCMU or in mutants defective in D1, the plastoquinone pool remained oxidized in wild type cells, despite transfer to HL. Thus LL conditions are mimicked, and LSU down-regulation was not observed. Preventing oxidation of the plastoquinone pool by incubation with DBMIB or by mutagenesis of the cytochrome b 6/fcomplex did not alter the pattern of LSU down-regulation. Although these results could indicate that the redox state of the PQ has a regulatory role in LSU synthesis during LL to HL shifts, previous fluorimetric measurements ruled out this possibility. The plastoquinone was reduced immediately after transfer from LL to HL and was maintained in a reduced state in HL (8.Shapira M. Lers A. Heifetz P. Irihimoritch V. Osmond B.C. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas LSU synthesis initially declined and then recovered. The labeling pattern of D1 indicated that in control cells synthesis of this protein increased 9-fold upon transfer from LL to HL, in line with previous observations (18.Schuster G. Timberg R. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This increase was inhibited by DCMU, DBMIB, and a mutation in cytochrome b 6/f. These data are in line with the redox control of D1 synthesis in the chloroplast (19.Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, it was difficult to explain why D1 synthesis increased (by 5.5-fold) in A251R*, because electron transport is blocked in this nonphotosynthetic mutant. Different forms of D1 that vary in their half lives were shown to coexist in the thylakoids of this mutant, and these could be reflected in the pattern of labeling (10.Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Excess energy not trapped by the photosynthetic electron transport chain can increase the formation of ROS at specific sites of the PSII and PSI reaction centers. In PSII, singlet oxygen is formed by the reaction of the triplet state of P680 with oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is generated both in PSI and in PSII, and can be converted to hydroxyradicals by interaction with non-heme iron (20.Bowler C. Montagu V. Inze D. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 83-116Crossref Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 21.Okada K. Ikeuchi M. Yamamoto N. Ono T.A. Miyao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 73-79Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As photoprotective mechanisms come into play (4.Anderson J.M. Osmond C.B. Shade-Sun Responses: Compromises between Acclimation and Photoinhibition. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 1-38Google Scholar, 5.Falkowski P. Laroche J. J. Phycol. 1991; 27: 8-14Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar), the free radical density should decline, and LSU synthesis would normalize once again. We therefore hypothesized that the increase in ROS could signal the down-regulation of LSU synthesis, either directly or indirectly. To test this possibility, ascorbic acid, which acts as an antioxidant by removing hydrogen peroxide (22.Alcher R.G. Donahue J.L. Cramer C.L. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 224-233Crossref Google Scholar) was added to cells labeled at HL. Synthesis of LSU was not interrupted if the cells were transferred to HL in the presence of ascorbic acid (5 and 10 mm), whereas in its absence, LSU translation decreased at HL (2 h). Addition of ascorbic acid increased the synthesis of D1 already at LL, thus reducing the difference between incorporation of radiolabel into D1 at LL and at HL (Fig.3 A). To examine whether accumulation of excess ROS indeed signaled the translational arrest of LSU, their level was measured using the oxidatively sensitive DCFH (15.Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). DCFH enters the cells in its diacetate form (DCFH-DA), becomes hydrolyzed and remains trapped intracellularly. Oxidation of DCFH by H2O2 generates DCF, a highly fluorescent compound. Although DCFH reacts mainly with H2O2, it is useful for monitoring other ROS species, because singlet oxygen is converted to superoxide anion resulting in the formation of H2O2 by superoxide dismutase activity (20.Bowler C. Montagu V. Inze D. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 83-116Crossref Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 23.Foyer C.H. Lelandais M. Kuner K.J. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 92: 696-717Crossref Google Scholar). The results of DCF fluorescence indicate that the level of ROS increased by almost 2-fold at 0.5 and 1.5 h after transfer from LL to HL and decreased after 2.5 h back to the level measured at LL (Fig. 3 B). Addition of ascorbic acid (5 and 10 mm) to wild type cells prevented the ROS increase at HL, in line with its antioxidant activity. To establish the correlation between down-regulation in LSU synthesis and the increase in ROS levels, DCF fluorescence was measured at LL and after transfer to HL in the presence of DCMU (10−7m) and DBMIB (10−6m) and in mutants defective in D1 and in cytochromeb 6/f. DCF fluorescence in cells transferred from LL to HL hardly changed in the presence of DCMU and in mutants deficient or defective in D1 (Fig.4, A–C), indicating that the level of ROS at HL did not increase. However, addition of DBMIB or inactivation of the cytochrome b 6/fcomplex did not prevent the increase in ROS at HL (Fig. 4, Dand E). With DBMIB (10−6m) the basal level of ROS was higher already at LL than that measured in the absence of this herbicide (Fig. 4 D). This result was in correlation to the already reduced synthesis of LSU observed with DBMIB at LL (10−6m, Fig. 1). To establish the direct involvement of ROS in signaling the down-regulation of LSU synthesis, cells were incubated at LL with MeV. MeV accepts an electron from ferredoxin and reacts with molecular O2, forming a superoxide radical anion that is transformed in subsequent reactions to ROS such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxy radicals (24.Härtel H. Haseloff R.F. Ebert B. Rank B. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biology. 1992; 12: 375-387Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The free radical pool can therefore be increased by MeV, similar to what occurs when cells are transferred from LL to HL. Cells were labeled at LL in the presence of MeV, (10−6–10−5m). Labeling was performed in the absence of anisomycin to maintain the synthesis of cytoplasmic proteins and to ensure that MeV did not cause a general decrease in protein synthesis, which could be masked in the presence of anisomycin. Increasing concentrations of MeV exclusively reduced the synthesis of LSU at LL (by 79% after 1 h), whereas synthesis of other proteins was unaffected. DCF fluorescence at LL in the presence of MeV (10−6–10−4m) shows an increase in the level of ROS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 B). Although the highest ROS level was measured with 10−4m, this concentration was too high for labeling, because it inhibited protein synthesis nonspecifically (data not shown). These results in combination with the labeling data indicate the role of ROS in controlling the translation of Rubisco LSU. Glutathione is a low molecular mass thiol that has a key regulatory role in plants and algae. Most of it is present in the reduced form (GSH), and only a minor fraction is oxidized and exists as two molecules of GSH linked by a disulfide bond (GSSG). An increase in ROS during stress could affect the GSH/GSSG ratio, shifting the balance toward oxidation. As shown in our DCF based fluorescence assay, a “light shock” causes a rapid increase in the level of ROS that subsequently returns to the original value measured at LL. We therefore examined whether the transient increase in ROS after the LL to HL shift is coupled to parallel changes in the GSH/GSSG ratio. Transfer ofC. reinhardtii cells from LL to HL resulted in a transient decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio (Fig.6 A) which dropped 2-fold after 1.5 h and recovered its original LL level within 6 h. The accumulation of excess ROS thus changed the redox state of glutathione, increasing its relative oxidized fraction. The changes in the GSH/GSSG ratio paralleled the down-regulation and the subsequent recovery of LSU synthesis. The translational arrest of LSU was maximal at 2 h and recovered after 4–6 h (8.Shapira M. Lers A. Heifetz P. Irihimoritch V. Osmond B.C. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The GSH/GSSG ratio returned to its original value also after 6 h, only after the level of ROS decreased. Modulation of the GSH/GSSG ratio by changes in the ROS level is further supported by the opposite effects observed for ascorbate and MeV. Addition of ascorbic acid to cells transferred to HL prevented the transient decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio (Fig. 6 B), and addition of MeV to cells grown at LL increased the relative fraction of oxidized glutathione decreasing the GSH/GSSG ratio, mimicking the transfer to HL (Fig. 6 C). Changes in light intensities play a key role in regulation of photosynthetic genes. Recent studies assigned a regulatory role for the redox state of components in the photosynthetic electron pathway in controlling expression of chloroplastic proteins (19.Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 25.Escoubas J.-M. Lomas M. LaRoche J. Falkowski P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Regulation of the nuclear encoded cab genes, and the chloroplast encoded psbA is thought to be controlled directly by the redox potential of specific components in the electron transport chain. Expression of cab genes is reversibly repressed by a phosphorylatable factor coupled to the redox status of PQ through a chloroplast protein kinase (25.Escoubas J.-M. Lomas M. LaRoche J. Falkowski P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Translation of D1 is subject to regulation by the redox state of thioredoxin and ferredoxin (19.Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) by affecting the thiol groups on proteins that bind to the 5′-untranslated region (26.Kim J. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1954-191957Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Unlike D1, whose synthesis gradually increases in response to elevation of light intensities, LSU synthesis follows a unique regulatory pattern, displayed by its transient arrest in cells transferred from LL to HL and a subsequent recovery upon photoacclimation (8.Shapira M. Lers A. Heifetz P. Irihimoritch V. Osmond B.C. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mechanism that regulates the synthesis of these two proteins should therefore differ. In this study we propose that translational arrest of rbcLis signaled by the increased generation of ROS that can modulate the redox potential of the glutathione pool and thus inhibit the translation of this protein. The labeling pattern of LSU in the presence of DCMU and DBMIB or in mutants defective at different sites of the electron transport chain could imply that the redox state of plastoquinone is involved in signaling the down-regulation in LSU synthesis. However, because the measured value of 1-qP (the index of QA reduction state) was high and remained unaltered during the first hours after transfer to HL, whereas LSU translation initially declined and then recovered (8.Shapira M. Lers A. Heifetz P. Irihimoritch V. Osmond B.C. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), changes in the redox state of PQ were not likely to be the direct cause for the down-regulation of LSU, although indirect effects of the chloroplast redox state could be involved. Alternatively, these results could be explained on the basis of ROS formation upon transfer to HL. The down-regulation of therbcL gene encoding LSU could occur in response to a signal generated by the imbalance that takes place when cells grown in LL, with their extensive chlorophyll antenna complexes, are shifted to HL. These antennae would trap more light quanta than can be processed by the photosynthetic electron transport system, resulting in the rapid elevation of ROS. As the antenna size is adjusted downward the imbalance would be dissipated, the level of ROS would decrease, and LSU synthesis would increase once again. Quantitative estimation of ROS correlates with this hypothesis, with their level transiently increasing upon transfer from LL to HL and then returning to the basal level. Incubation with ascorbic acid prevented the increase in ROS at HL and prevented the translational arrest of LSU. In accordance with these data, incubation of cells at LL in the presence of MeV, an inducer of ROS in the chloroplast, led to the increase of ROS and the down-regulation of LSU synthesis, whereas translation of other proteins was unaffected. The results of labeling wild type cells in the presence of herbicides or labeling of mutants defective at different sites of the electron transport chain could also be interpreted by ROS formation. DCMU protects cells from the oxidative stress experienced during high intensity illumination by preventing the increase in ROS and the light induced breakdown of D1 (27.Jegerschöld C. Virgin I. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6179-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28.Gong H. Ohad I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 181-188Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The DCF-based measurements of ROS in the presence of DCMU confirmed this observation, which correlated with the continued synthesis of LSU at HL in the presence of DCMU. Likewise, ROS levels in nonphotosynthetic D1 mutants did not show a marked increase at HL. DBMIB or mutations in the cytochromeb 6/f complex did not prevent the elevation of ROS levels nor the translational arrest of LSU. The increase in ROS in the presence of DBMIB is relatively short-term for reasons not completely clear to us; however, the basal level of ROS is high already at LL, possibly because of the block in the electron pathway. Previous reports indicated that ROS can function as second messengers in mediating stress responses in plants. Plants attacked by pathogens respond by elevating ROS levels, leading to the induction of pathogen response genes (29.Chen Z. Silva H. Klessig D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 1883-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 30.Green R. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of pathogen response genes can also be obtained by elicitors of ROS (31.Allan A. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), by direct application of H2O2 (32.Bei Y.M. Kenton P. Mur L. Darby R. Draper J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), or by suppression of catalase activity resulting in increased levels of H2O2 (33.Chamnongpol S. Willekens H. Langebartels C. Van M.M. Inze D. Van C.W. Plant J. 1996; 10: 491-503Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 34.Chen Z. Malamy J. Henning J. Conrath U. Sanchez C.P. Silva H. Ricigliano J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4134-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Modulation of gene expression by ROS can be mediated by changes in the redox state of the glutathione pool (23.Foyer C.H. Lelandais M. Kuner K.J. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 92: 696-717Crossref Google Scholar, 35.Wingate V.P.M. Lawton M.A. Lamb C.J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevation of reduced glutathione in transformed plants overexpressing glutathione reductase increased resistance to oxidative stress (36.Foyer C.H. Souriau N. Perret S. Lelandais-M Kunert K.J. Pruvost C. Jouanin L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and changes in the redox status of glutathione regulated the expression of copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase and of ascorbate peroxidase (37.Karpinski S. Escobar C. Karpinska B. Creissen G. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Here we show that transfer of cells from LL to HL causes a transient increase in ROS that correlates with the reduction in the GSH/GSSG ratio. Addition of ascorbic acid prevented the increase in ROS, and thus the GSH/GSSG ratio remained unaltered at HL, whereas addition of MeV at LL increased the formation of ROS and decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio. Concomitantly, ascorbic acid prevented the down-regulation of LSU translation at HL and MeV induced it at LL. Thus the decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio in the chloroplast could serve as a signal for the translational arrest of LSU. We hypothesize that translational arrest of the rbcL transcript could occur because of oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in one or more of the components of the translational initiation complex that assembles on the rbcL5′-untranslated region. During photoacclimation the intrachloroplastic glutathione pool shifts to its reduced form, oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups on the target protein is reversed, and translation of LSU can proceed. At this stage the nature of the putative protein that modulates translation of the rbcL transcript possibly by oxidation of its sulfhydryl groups is yet unclear. In addition to its role in translational control, redox changes induced during photoinhibitory stress and senescence have been implicated in Rubisco breakdown (38.Moreno J. Penarrubia L. Garcia-Ferris C. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 121-127Google Scholar, 39.Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in critical Cys residues has been demonstrated to play a key role in LSU degradation (40.Moreno J. J. S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26789-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The time period required for recovery of the GSH/GSSG ratio is similar to that observed for restoration of LSU translation (4–6 h), suggesting that the two processes are associated. However, the level of ROS returned to its original level already within 2.5 h. This difference can be explained by a lag period that is required for the cell to overcome the oxidative damage induced by the transfer to HL. The delay in restoring the GSH/GSSG ratio could be due to a requirement for synthesis of new proteins. The synthesis of subunits that compose organellar multimeric protein complexes is coordinated, even when they are encoded by the different genomes of the cell (41.Schmidt G.W. Mishkind M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 42.Choquet Y. Stern D.B. Wostrikoff-K Kuras R. Girard-Bascou J. F. A. W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4380-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Translation of the chloroplast-encoded Rubisco LSU was inhibited when the two genes encoding the small subunits in C. reinhardtii were deleted (43.Khrebtukova I. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13689-13693Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or if their synthesis was inhibited by the antisense approach (44.Rodermel S. Haley J. Jiang C.Z. Tsai C.H. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3881-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unlike these effects, the transient arrest in LSU translation that we observe during a light shock in C. reinhardtii did not lead to a coordinated down-regulation of small subunit synthesis, possibly because the down-regulation of LSU was short-term and not long enough to affect the steady state of this protein (8.Shapira M. Lers A. Heifetz P. Irihimoritch V. Osmond B.C. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Uncoordinated synthesis of Rubisco subunits has been previously reported, but only during a short term (45.Barraclough R. Ellis J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the current study reveals a novel signaling mechanism that controls translation of Rubisco LSU, the physiological significance of its down-regulation during a light shock remains to be elucidated. We suggest that the arrest in LSU synthesis ceases Rubisco assembly, thus releasing the Cpn60/10 chaperonins from mediating assembly of this highly abundant complex and transiently recruiting them for overcoming the damaging effects of oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W2057422374,"The ability of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate (HOPDA) hydrolase (BphD) ofBurkholderia cepacia LB400 to hydrolyze polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) metabolites was assessed by determining its specificity for monochlorinated HOPDAs. The relative specificities of BphD for HOPDAs bearing chlorine substituents on the phenyl moiety were 0.28, 0.38, and 1.1 for 8-Cl, 9-Cl, and 10-Cl HOPDA, respectively,versus HOPDA (100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 25 °C). In contrast, HOPDAs bearing chlorine substituents on the dienoate moiety were poor substrates for BphD, which hydrolyzed 3-Cl, 4-Cl, and 5-Cl HOPDA at relative maximal rates of 2.1 × 10−3, 1.4 × 10−4, and 0.36, respectively, versus HOPDA. The enzymatic transformation of 3-, 5-, 8-, 9-, and 10-Cl HOPDAs yielded stoichiometric quantities of the corresponding benzoate, indicating that BphD catalyzes the hydrolysis of these HOPDAs in the same manner as unchlorinated HOPDA. HOPDAs also underwent a nonenzymatic transformation to products that included acetophenone. In the case of 4-Cl HOPDA, this transformation proceeded via the formation of 4-OH HOPDA (t 12 = 2.8 h; 100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 25 °C). 3-Cl HOPDA (t 12 = 504 h) was almost 3 times more stable than 4-OH HOPDA. Finally, 3-Cl, 4-Cl and 4-OH HOPDAs competitively inhibited the BphD-catalyzed hydrolysis of HOPDA (K ic values of 0.57 ± 0.04, 3.6 ± 0.2, and 0.95 ± 0.04 μm, respectively). These results explain the accumulation of HOPDAs and chloroacetophenones in the microbial degradation of certain PCB congeners. More significantly, they indicate that in the degradation of PCB mixtures, BphD would be inhibited, thereby slowing the mineralization of all congeners. BphD is thus a key determinant in the aerobic microbial degradation of PCBs.

In the case of 4-Cl HOPDA, this transformation proceeded via the formation of 4-OH HOPDA (t 12 = 2.8 h; 100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 25 °C). 3-Cl HOPDA (t 12 = 504 h) was almost 3 times more stable than 4-OH HOPDA. Finally, 3-Cl, 4-Cl and 4-OH HOPDAs competitively inhibited the BphD-catalyzed hydrolysis of HOPDA (K ic values of 0.57 ± 0.04, 3.6 ± 0.2, and 0.95 ± 0.04 μm, respectively). These results explain the accumulation of HOPDAs and chloroacetophenones in the microbial degradation of certain PCB congeners. More significantly, they indicate that in the degradation of PCB mixtures, BphD would be inhibited, thereby slowing the mineralization of all congeners. BphD is thus a key determinant in the aerobic microbial degradation of PCBs. polychlorinated biphenyl HOPDA hydrolase 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl DHB dioxygenase dichlorobiphenyl heteronuclear multiple bond correlation 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate high pressure liquid chromatography nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy trichlorobiphenyl PCBs1 are one of the most widely distributed classes of chlorinated pollutants in the environment (1.Tiedje J.M. Quensen III, J.F. Chee-Sanford J. Schimel J.P. Boyd S.A. Biodegradation. 1993; 4: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Commercial mixtures of PCBs typically consist of over 60 of the 209 possible congeners, differing in the number and position of the chloro substituents. Although their production and widespread usage has been banned in the industrial world for over 20 years, the destruction of PCBs is of continued relevance due to their pervasiveness and persistence in soils and sediments, their impact on fragile ecosystems, such as those found in the Arctic, and human health concerns (2.McFarland V.A. Clarke J.U. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 81: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The persistence of PCBs is due in part to their thermodynamic stability, structural diversity, and strong adsorption to organic matter. The discovery that a variety of microorganisms transform some PCB congeners has fueled interest in harnessing microbial catabolic capabilities to remediate sites contaminated by these pollutants. Effective bioremediation strategies require increasing the bioavailability of these compounds and optimizing the microbial catabolic activities involved in their mineralization (3.Head I.M. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 599-608Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar,4.Focht D.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 341-346Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Many PCBs are transformed aerobically by the bph pathway, which is found in a wide variety of soil isolates (5.Furukawa K. Tomizuka N. Kamibayashi A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 301-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Bedard D.L. Unterman R. Bopp L.H. Brennan M.J. Haberl M.L. Johnson C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1986; 51: 761-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upperbph pathway consists of four enzymatic activities that act sequentially to transform biphenyl to benzoate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate via dihydroxylation of one of the aryl rings and the production of a catecholic intermediate (4.Focht D.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 341-346Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ability of the bph pathway to transform PCB congeners is strain-dependent (5.Furukawa K. Tomizuka N. Kamibayashi A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 301-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Bedard D.L. Unterman R. Bopp L.H. Brennan M.J. Haberl M.L. Johnson C. Appl. Environ.

However, even the so called “best” PCB-degrading strains, such as Burkholderia cepacia LB400, transform few highly chlorinated congeners and do not effectively mineralize all lightly chlorinated congeners (5.Furukawa K. Tomizuka N. Kamibayashi A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 301-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Bedard D.L. Unterman R. Bopp L.H. Brennan M.J. Haberl M.L. Johnson C. Appl. Environ.

Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2654-2655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These different catabolic capabilities have been studied largely as a function of biphenyl dioxygenase, which catalyzes the initial dihydroxylation of the PCB congener. Accordingly, this enzyme has been studied with a view to augmenting its utility for the degradation of PCBs (9.Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3936-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Hurtubise Y. Barriault D.

In contrast to these efforts, there have been very few reports on the ability of other bph pathway enzymes to transform chlorinated metabolites. Such studies are essential to understanding the basis of microbial catabolic activities and improving these activities for PCB degradation. Studies in which intact cells were incubated with individual PCB congeners indicate that the fourth enzyme of the bph pathway limits the degradation of PCBs by this pathway. This hydrolase, BphD (EC 3.7.1.8), catalyzes carbon-carbon bond cleavage of HOPDA (14.Catelani D. Colombi A. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), yielding 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate and benzoate (SchemeFS1) (15.Omori T. Sugimura K. Ishigooka H. Minoda Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 931-937Google Scholar). Incubation of two different biphenyl-degrading strains with 2,4′-diClB (2,4,4′-triClB and 2,4′,5-triClB, respectively) resulted in the accumulation of chlorinated HOPDAs (5.Furukawa K. Tomizuka N. Kamibayashi A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 301-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported in several other strains, including B. cepacia LB400 (7.Bedard D.L. Haberl M.L. Microbiol. Ecol. 1990; 20: 87-102Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8.Seeger M. Timmis K.N. Hofer B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2654-2655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in none of these studies were the accumulated chlorinated HOPDAs well characterized. Other congeners, such as 2,3,3′-triClB, have been reported to give rise to chloroacetophenones (7.Bedard D.L. Haberl M.L. Microbiol. Ecol. 1990; 20: 87-102Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16.Bedard D.L. Haberl M.L. May R.J. Brennan M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformations leading to chloroacetophenones have yet to be described. BphD belongs to a family of enzymes involved in the aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds, hydrolyzing vinylogous 1,5-diketones formed by the dioxygenative meta-ring cleavage of arenes (17.Hofer B. Eltis L.D. Dowling D.N. Timmis K.N. Gene. 1992; 130: 47-55Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These enzymes have an α/β hydrolase fold as well as conserved serine, histidine, and aspartate residues, reminiscent of the catalytic triad present in a number of other hydrolytic enzymes (18.Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on XylF, the hydrolase of the toluene and xylene degradation (TOL) pathway, and BphD of Comamonas testosteroni B-356 have confirmed that these residues are critical for catalysis (19.Diaz E. Timmis K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6403-6411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Ahmad D. Fraser J. Sylvestre M. Larose A. Khan A. Bergeron J. Juteau J.M. Sondossi M. Gene. 1995; 156: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conserved serine residue appears to act as a base (21.Fleming S.M. Robertson T.A. Langley G.J. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More specifically, mechanistic studies on MhpC, a hydrolase involved in the degradation of phenylpropionate, indicate that the substrate is first bound in the enol form and undergoes tautomerization to the keto form before being subject to base-catalyzed attack by water (21.Fleming S.M. Robertson T.A. Langley G.J. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22.Lam W.W.Y. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12242-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23.Henderson I.M.J. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12252-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the keto form of the substrate binds weakly and can dissociate from the active site prior to attack by water. Steady-state kinetic studies on BphD of B. cepacia LB400 (BphDLB400) indicate that this enzyme is also “leaky” (24.Seah Y.K.S. Terracina G. Bolin J.T. Riebel P. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22943-22949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To investigate the significance of BphD in the microbial degradation of PCBs, the specificity of BphDLB400 for monochlorinated HOPDAs was determined by steady-state kinetics. The HOPDAs used in these studies were generated enzymatically from the extradiol cleavage of the corresponding chlorinated dihydroxybiphenyls and were characterized using UV-visible and NMR spectroscopies. The stability and acid dissociation constants of the HOPDAs in aqueous buffer were determined. The transformation products of the HOPDAs in the absence and presence of BphD were investigated by HPLC. The results of these studies are discussed in terms of the degradation of PCBs, as well as the mechanism of BphD-related hydrolases. DHB, 4-Cl, 5-Cl, 6-Cl, 2′-Cl, 3′-Cl, and 4′-Cl DHBs were synthesized by a combined directed orthometalation-cross coupling strategy, purified to greater than 99% purity, and fully characterized as described elsewhere (25.Nerdinger S. Kendall C. Marchhart R. Riebel P. Johnson M.R. Yin C-F. Eltis L.D. Snieckus V. Chem. Commun. 1999; 22: 2259-2260Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. BphDLB400 was purified to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli DH5α containing the plasmid pSS314 as described previously (24.Seah Y.K.S. Terracina G. Bolin J.T. Riebel P. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22943-22949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DHBD was purified anaerobically from B. cepacia LB400 containing the plasmid pLEBD4 as described previously (26.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Aliquots of concentrated enzymes were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All buffers were made with water purified to a resistivity of 17 to 18 MΩ-cm using a NANOpure UV water purifier (Barnstead, Dubuque, IA). The pH was determined using a model PHM93 reference pH meter (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Stock solutions of HOPDAs in 100 mm ionic strength of potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, were prepared immediately prior to use. HOPDAs was prepared by dissolving the corresponding DHB in a small volume of 95% ethanol and diluting to the desired volume with buffer (ethanol constituted less than 0.1% of the enzymatic assay solution). To this solution was added a sufficient amount of DHBD to completely transform the DHB to the corresponding HOPDA. Extinction coefficients of the yellow-colored HOPDAs were determined by adding excess quantities of the ring cleavage enzyme to solutions containing weighed amounts of DHB and determining the resultant absorbance spectrophotometrically. In the preparation of stock solutions of HOPDAs for the hydrolase assays, complete conversion was verified by ensuring that (i) there was no further increase in absorbance at the wavelength of maximum absorbance upon addition of fresh ring cleavage enzyme to a diluted sample, and (ii) the absorbance expected from the amount of DHB present and the determined extinction coefficient was obtained. HOPDAs used for steady-state kinetic studies were prepared enzymatically, divided into aliquots, frozen at −80 °C, and used within 8 h of being frozen. For all HOPDAs except 4-Cl HOPDA, individual aliquots were thawed as needed and used within 1 h of being thawed. In the case of 4-Cl HOPDA, aliquots were used immediately after being thawed. To determine the configuration of chlorinated HOPDAs in solution, HOPDAs were prepared from the respective DHBs as described above, acidified to pH 3 with 12 n HCl, and then extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The pooled organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, which was then removed by filtration. To prepare the free acid of the respective HOPDAs, the ethyl acetate fraction was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. To prepare the sodium salt of the respective HOPDAs, a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide dissolved in ethanol was added to the ethyl acetate fraction. The precipitated salt was washed with ethyl acetate and then dried under reduced pressure. The free acid and sodium salt forms of the HOPDAs were stored in a dessicator at 4 °C. For NMR analysis, the free acid and sodium salt of the HOPDAs were dissolved in deuterated acetone-d6 or deuterated phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, respectively, to a final concentration of about 40 mm. To determine pK a values, each HOPDA was generated by the cleavage of the corresponding DHB, as described above, in 20 ml of unbuffered water. DHBD was removed by ultrafiltration using a stirred cell equipped with a YM10 membrane (Amicon). The enzyme-free ultrafiltrate, which contained approximately 0.5 mm HOPDA, was acidified with 12 n HCl to pH 3. This solution was titrated with aliquots of 10 μl 50 mm NaOH, and the pH was determined after the addition of each aliquot. The pK a values were determined from plots of pHversus amount of base added. The stability of each HOPDA was determined by spectrophotometrically monitoring the decrease in absorbance of a solution of the HOPDA (100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 25 °C) at the wavelength of maximum absorbance of the enolate tautomer of the HOPDA. The experiments were repeated using three different concentrations of each HOPDA (0.03, 0.3, and 0.7 mm). Half-lives were determined by fitting the data to a first-order decay using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). To prepare transformation products, 0.1 to 0.2 mm samples of freshly prepared HOPDA (100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5) were incubated in the absence or presence of purified BphD. When present, BphD was added to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml, and the samples were monitored for up to 1 h. When no BphD was present, the samples were monitored for up to 4 days. The transformation of the HOPDA was monitored spectrophotometrically at the appropriate wavelengths. Transformation products were analyzed by HPLC as described below. Experiments were done in duplicate. 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker Avance DMX 500 MHz spectrometer, a Bruker Avance DPX 300 MHz spectrometer, and a Bruker AC300 spectrometer. The Avance models were interfaced with Silicon Graphics workstations. HOPDA samples were dissolved in acetone-d6, and solvent peaks were used as internal standards (1H = 2.04 ppm). NOESY and HMBC spectra were recorded using standard 2D sequences. In the NOESY sequence (recycle – π/2 – Δ – π/2 – τm – π/2 – acquire), the recycle delay and mixing time (τm) were 1 s. The variable delay increment was optimized to cover the useful NMR frequency range. The F2 dimension FID was defined with 2K points, and the F1 dimension was defined with 128 increments. Eight scans were summed for each increment. In the HMBC sequence (recycle – π/2 (P1) – Δ (½J) – π/2 (P3) – Δ (D6) – π/2 (P3) – (Dφ) – π – (Dφ) – π/2 (P3) – acquire), the recycle delay was 1 s, the evolution delay (D6) was 100 μs, and the increment delay (Dφ) was 3 μs. Twelve scans were summed for each increment. All final two-dimensional maps were symmetrized about the diagonal. Spectra were simulated using the ACD Labs software package (Advanced Chemistry Development Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Elemental analyses were performed by Canadian Microanalytical Service Ltd. (Delta, British Columbia, Canada). HOPDA transformation products were analyzed using a Hewlett Packard model HP1050 HPLC (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a Hewlett Packard ODS Hypersil C18 column (125 × 4 mm) and operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples of 10 μl were injected into the HPLC. Samples analyzed for benzoates were eluted with 55% methanol:0.22% phosphoric acid:44.78% water, and the eluate was monitored at 230 nm. Samples analyzed for acetophenones were eluted with 40% methanol:0.3% phosphoric acid:59.7% water or 35% methanol:0.325% phosphoric acid:64.675% water, and the eluate was monitored at 250 nm. The retention times, peak areas, and absorption spectra of the eluted compounds were compared with standards containing known concentrations (100, 200, and 400 μm) of benzoate, acetophenone, or their chlorinated derivatives. Enzymatic activity was measured by following the consumption of the yellow substrate using a Varian Cary 3 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermojacketed cuvette holder. The spectrophotometer was interfaced to a microcomputer and controlled by Cary OS/2 multitasking software. The amount of enzyme used in each assay was adjusted so that the progress curve was linear for at least 2 min. Initial velocities were determined from a least squares analysis of the progress curves using the kinetics module of the Cary software. Specificity and inhibition experiments were carried out in a total volume of 1.0 ml of 100 mm ionic strength potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 5–10 μl of an appropriately diluted enzyme preparation to the reaction cuvette. A reaction mixture prepared without the hydrolytic enzyme served as a reference. Reactions were monitored at the wavelengths indicated in Table I. For specificity experiments, initial velocities were determined at substrate concentrations that ranged from 0.3 to 10 times the K m for that substrate. For inhibition experiments, HOPDA was used as a substrate and the concentration of inhibitor was varied from at least 0.7 to 4 times the K i for that compound. At each concentration of inhibitor, the concentration of HOPDA was varied from 0.3 to 10 times its apparent K m. Initial velocities determined at different substrate and inhibitor concentrations were fitted to the appropriate equations using the least squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (27.Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The validity of the kinetic models was evaluated using residual plots and analyses of variance (F statistic).Table IMolar extinction coefficients of chlorinated HOPDAsCompoundWavelengthεt 1/2pK anmmm −1 cm −1hHOPDA43425.7587.33-Cl HOPDA43240.65046.14-Cl HOPDA409.526.8179a4-Cl HOPDA was transformed to 4-OH HOPDA (t 1/2 = 2.8 h), which was further transformed (t 1/2 = 179 h) as described under “Results.”5-Cl HOPDA40240.13606.18-Cl HOPDA39340.31976.59-Cl HOPDA43628.2506.810-Cl HOPDA43826.3486.9Molar extinction coefficients and half-lives were determined in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 25 °C using freshly generated HOPDAs. The pK a values of the respective enolates were determined in unbuffered water.a 4-Cl HOPDA was transformed to 4-OH HOPDA (t 1/2 = 2.8 h), which was further transformed (t 1/2 = 179 h) as described under “Results.” Open table in a new tab Molar extinction coefficients and half-lives were determined in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 25 °C using freshly generated HOPDAs. The pK a values of the respective enolates were determined in unbuffered water. Solutions of the freshly prepared HOPDAs, produced from the DHBD-catalyzed cleavage of the corresponding DHBs in 100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5 (25 °C), all had the characteristic yellow color of the enolate anion. Accordingly, the absorption spectra of these solutions had wavelengths of maximal absorbance between 390 and 440 nm (TableI). The extinction coefficient at this wavelength for each HOPDA are given in Table I. This table also summarizes the pK a values for the enolic hydroxyl group for HOPDA and each chlorinated HOPDA as determined by titration. The pK a value was relatively unaffected by chloro substituents at C-9 or C-10. In contrast, chloro substituents at C-3, C-5, or C-8 lowered the pK a value by 0.7 to 1 unit. As described below, the pK a of 4-Cl HOPDA could not be reliably determined due to its nonenzymatic transformation, which is accelerated at high pH (>9). All HOPDAs were observed to undergo a spontaneous transformation in aqueous buffer. The half-lives of the HOPDAs, determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of the enolate anion, indicated that their stability varied according to the position of chloro substituent (Table I). Interestingly, this stability appears to correlate with the pK a of the enolic group. Thus, HOPDA, 9-Cl HOPDA, and 10-Cl HOPDA, the enolic pK avalues of which are between 6.8 and 7.3, had half-lives of about 50 h. In contrast, 3-Cl, 5-Cl, and 8-Cl HOPDA, with pK a between 6.1 and 6.5, had half-lives of over 200 h. It appears that the compounds with lower pK a values are more stable due to the presence of higher proportion of enolate species at pH 7.5. 4-Cl HOPDA differed from the other HOPDAs in that it underwent two successive transformation in aqueous solution. When prepared freshly from 5-Cl DHB, 4-Cl HOPDA had a maximal absorption at 409.5 nm at pH 7.5, typical of an enolate anion (compound A). Compound A underwent an initial transformation to compound B, the absorption spectrum of which was characterized by a maximum at 300 nm and isosbestic points at 262, 281, and 344 nm with respect to the initial enolate (Fig.1). The half-life of the transformation of compound A to B was 2.8 h at pH 7.5 and decreased at basic pH. Compound B underwent a second transformation with a half-life of 179 h. Addition of 0.6 m sodium borate to a mixture of compounds A and B at pH 7.5 yielded a spectrum with features at 395 and 409.5 nm (Fig. 1), the relative intensities of which depended on the proportion of compounds A and B in the mixture. Addition of borate to a solution of freshly prepared 4-Cl HOPDA yielded a spectrum that was similar to that of the enolate anion. In contrast, addition of borate to a solution containing 95% compound B yielded a spectrum with an absorbance maximum at 395 nm and a shoulder around 409 nm. Borate promotes the tautomerization of α-ketoacids to α-enol acids through the formation of borate-enol complexes (28.Knox W.E. Pitt B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 675-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Koester R. Rotermund G.W. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1965; 689: 40-64Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was thus concluded that 4-Cl HOPDA was initially transformed to a structurally similar α-ketoacid. Compound B was identified as 4-OH HOPDA by NMR and elemental analysis as described below. The 1H NMR spectra of HOPDAs in acetone indicated that the monochlorinated HOPDAs exist in different tautomeric forms dependent on the position of the chloro substituent on the dienoate (TableII). The spectrum of HOPDA was in good agreement with the reported spectrum and indicated that this compound exists as an enol in a trans transoid configuration (14.Catelani D. Colombi A. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1). The spectrum of 5-Cl HOPDA revealed two doublets at 7.59 and 6.68 ppm. These correspond to H-3 and H-4, respectively, and indicate that 5-Cl HOPDA also exists in a single enolic form in acetone. The coupling constants of the H-3 and H-4 protons are consistent with a transoid configuration. In contrast, the1H NMR spectrum of 3-Cl HOPDA demonstrated that this compound exists in both enol and keto tautomeric forms in a ratio of 2:1 respectively (Table II). Identification of the keto form was based on the occurrence of a doublet at 4.41 ppm, corresponding to the saturated CH2 of the keto tautomer (H-5K) and a triplet at 7.52 ppm, corresponding to the β proton of the α/β unsaturated carbonyl (H-4K). Significantly, the1H NMR spectrum of 3-Cl HOPDA in deuterated phosphate buffer indicated that this compound exists as an enol in aqueous solution, consistent with the electronic absorption spectrum.Table IIAssignment of 1 H NMR of HOPDAsCompoundProton345orthometaparaHOPDAδ (ppm)6.54 (d)7.90 (dd)7.40 (d)8.07 (d)7.53–7.68J (Hz)11.811.8, 15.115.17.33-Cl HOPDAδ (ppm)8.58 (bd)7.12 (bd)7.997.70–7.48 EnolJ(Hz)—aThe coupling constant was not determined due to the broadness of the peak.—aThe coupling constant was not determined due to the broadness of the peak.3-Cl HOPDAδ (ppm)7.52 (t)4.41 (d)8.087.70–7.48 KetoJ (Hz)7.57.54-Cl HOPDAδ (ppm)7.29 (s)6.98 (s)8.05 (d)7.67–7.50J(Hz)7.14-OH HOPDAδ (ppm)6.42 (s)6.61 (s)7.79 (d)7.67–7.50J (Hz)7.35-Cl HOPDAδ (ppm)7.59 (d)6.68 (d)7.73 (d)7.54 (dd)7.63 (d)J(Hz)11.211.277.7, 7.47.4Spectra were recorded in acetone-d6, and chemical shifts are reported relative to solvent peaks as internal standards.a The coupling constant was not determined due to the broadness of the peak. Open table in a new tab Spectra were recorded in acetone-d6, and chemical shifts are reported relative to solvent peaks as internal standards. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of 4-Cl HOPDA preparations in acetone revealed the presence of two structurally similar compounds, A and B, consistent with the absorption spectra of borate complexes of these preparations (Figs.2 and 3). Elemental analysis of compound B demonstrated that it contained no chlorine, consisting of 60.93% C, 4.45% H, and 34.36% O. Based on simulated NMR spectra, the elemental analysis, and chemical considerations, it was proposed that compounds A and B correspond to 4-Cl and 4-OH HOPDAs, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture of compounds A and B, resonances corresponding to 4-Cl HOPDA were observed at 7.29 ppm (H-3A) and 6.98 ppm (H-5A). A NOESY spectrum (Fig. 2) revealed a cross-peak between H-5A (6.98 ppm) and the two orthoprotons on the aromatic ring (8.05 ppm), confirming the assignment of the singlet at 7.29 ppm to H-3A. Similarly, resonances corresponding"

The present study reports on the ability of four MSH peptides to control intracellular peroxide levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in pigmentary and nonpigmentary cells. In human HBL melanoma and HaCaT keratinocytes tumor necrosis factor α and H2O2 both activated GPx in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (by 30–45 min). α-MSH peptides were found to inhibit the stimulated GPx activity and had biphasic dose-response curves. MSH 1–13 and MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7] achieved maximum inhibition at 10−10 and 10−12m, respectively. Higher concentrations (10–100 fold) of MSH 4–10 and MSH 11–13 were required to produce equivalent levels of inhibition. α-MSH was also capable of reducing peroxide accumulation within 15 min, and again this inhibition was biphasic. The data support a role of α-MSH in acute protection of cells to oxidative/cytokine action that precedes NF-κB and GPx activation. The rapidity and potency of the response to α-MSH in pigmentary and nonpigmentary cells suggest this to be a central role of this peptide in cutaneous cells.

However, more recent work has demonstrated potent and broad acting roles as an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory peptide (2.Lipton J.M. Catania A. Immunol.

The actions of α-MSH are transmitted via a family of specific MC G-protein receptors. Five different MC receptors (MC-1R to MC-5R) have been cloned and are located on pigmentary cells (e.g. melanocytes and melanoma cells) but also on several dissimilar nonpigmentary cell types (e.g.monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neural cells, and adipocytes) (8.Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Cone R.D. Science. 1992; 257: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which α-MSH acts as an anti-inflammatory peptide is not completely understood, but a number of studies suggest inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production/action (e.g. TNF-α and IL-1 (5.Weiss J.M. Sundar S.K. Cierpial M.A. Ritchie J.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 192: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) or an increase in the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10 (9.Bhardwaj R.S. Shwarz A. Becher E. Mahnke K. Aragane Y. Schwarz T. Luger T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2517-2521PubMed Google Scholar)). Consistent with these reports, our group has previously suggested α-MSH to have a role in cutaneous immunomodulation. Thus α-MSH was demonstrated to inhibit the ability of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α to up-regulate ICAM-1 expression on melanocytes and melanoma cells (10.Hedley S.J. Gawkrodger D.J. Weetman A.P. Morandini R. Boeynaems J. Ghanem G. MacNeil S. Br. J. Dermatol. 1998; 138: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11.Morandini R. Boeynams J.M. Hedley S.J. MacNeil S. Ghanem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Surface ICAM-1 expression is a necessary requirement for T-lymphocyte binding to target cells. It is known that melanoma cells are able to produce α-MSH/ACTH, and therefore it is possible that α-MSH may prevent immune system recognition of melanoma cells (10.Hedley S.J. Gawkrodger D.J. Weetman A.P. Morandini R. Boeynaems J. Ghanem G. MacNeil S. Br. J. Dermatol. 1998; 138: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11.Morandini R. Boeynams J.M. Hedley S.J. MacNeil S. Ghanem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). α-MSH autocrine control may similarly extend to regulating inflammation in skin (e.g. following UV exposure) and may include autocrine/paracrine regulation on other cutaneous cells, such as keratinocytes and Langerhans cells in addition to melanocytes. In investigating the mechanism of action of α-MSH inhibition of TNF-α-stimulated up-regulation of ICAM-1 (which was evident after a 24-h exposure to TNF-α and α-MSH), we have recently reported that α-MSH acts as a potent inhibitor of TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB transcription factor in melanoma cells and melanocytes (12.Haycock J.W. Wagner M. Morandini R. Ghanem G. Rennie I.G. Mac Neil S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 560-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NF-κB is responsible for expression of several inflammatory and immune system genes, and hence inhibition of its activity by α-MSH is likely to be one important signaling pathway by which α-MSH exhibits anti-inflammatory behavior. Maximum inhibition of NF-κB activity by α-MSH occurred after 2 h. The rapid activation of NF-κB is triggered by several stimuli, in particular, cytokines, lipopolysaccharides, and UV light, but also by ROS or “oxidative stress” (13.Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar, 14.Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A.

Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the transient intracellular generation of ROS, especially as peroxide, has the potential to act as second signaling messengers although the precise identity of a particular ROS species remains to be identified (15.Flohé L. Brigelius-Flohe R. Saliou C. Traber M.G. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). TNF-α signaling is known to generate intracellular peroxide species because of “leakage” of electrons via complexes I and III of the mitochondrial electron respiratory chain. Release of superoxide anions and rapid dismutation to peroxide by manganese-superoxide dismutase is thought to occur, and a number of studies suggest that this oxidative generation is an important step in the TNF-α postreceptor signaling pathway (16.Hoffman M. Weinberg J.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1987; 42: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17.Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Bayaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Levels of intracellular peroxide are controlled by the GPx family of antioxidant enzymes (19.Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Floré R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Cellular, extracellular and a phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx isoforms exist, and each contains a seleno-cysteine catalytic center. Together, these have the ability to metabolize H2O2 and organic and lipid peroxide species (catalase is also able to scavenge hydrogen peroxide but is present at lower levels than GPx in most cell types). Accordingly, GPx is thought to be of primary importance in ROS metabolism in most tissues and has therefore been suggested to have a role in controlling transcription factor activity and gene expression by regulating the availability of those peroxide derivatives reported to have second messenger potential (15.Flohé L. Brigelius-Flohe R. Saliou C. Traber M.G. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of how α-MSH assists cells to resist pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. We examined TNF-α and hydrogen peroxide activation of GPx and generation of intracellular peroxide (as GPx substrate) in a cutaneous melanoma cell line and a keratinocyte cell line, investigating to what extent α-MSH is able to oppose these early events in the response of cells to proinflammatory and oxidative species. HBL is a human cutaneous melanoma cell line established in one of our laboratories (20.Ghanem G.E. Comunale G. Libert A. Vercammen-Grandjean A. Lejeune F.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Ham F-10 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% newborm calf serum (Advanced Protein Products, West Midlands, UK), 2 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. HaCaT is a human keratinocyte cell line obtained as a generous gift from Professor N. E. Fusenig (Institute of Biochemistry, German Cancer Research Center, Heildelberg, Germany). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Poole, UK), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Melanoma cells and keratinocytes were seeded into T75 flasks at 2 × 106cells/flask and grown to ∼60% confluence. Medium was changed 18 h prior to experimentation and TNF-α (100 units/ml to 1200 units/ml) or H2O2 (100 μm to 1200 μm) were added for 15, 30, 45, 60, or 120 min (note that H2O2 at 1200 μm for 120 min was not found to be cytotoxic). α-MSH and related peptides, forskolin (10−5 and 10−4m) or isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (10−4 and 10−3m), were added to the cells 15 min prior to the addition of TNF-α or H2O2. The peptides used were: (i) α-MSH 1–13, (ii) α-MSH 4–10, (iii) α-MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7], and (iv) α-MSH 11–13 at 1 × 10−13 to 1 × 10−8m. Incubations were terminated by medium removal and washing (×2) of cells in PBS. Cells were then removed by scraping and processed for glutathione peroxidase activity measurement. Glutathione peroxidase was measured according to the method in Ref. 21.Flohé L. Günzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4074) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were removed by scraping and resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0, and placed on ice. Cell lysis was obtained by repeated needle aspiration, and the membrane fraction was then removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 5 min. 20 μl of supernatant was used for each assay. Test mixtures for the determination of GPx contained 1 mm GSH, 0.15 mm β-NADPH, 0.24 units/ml glutathione reductase in 0.1mK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm EDTA. Reactions were started by the addition oft-butyl hydroperoxide (0.12 mm final concentration), and oxidation of β-NADPH was followed for 5 min at 340 nm using a Labsystems iEMS 96-well plate reading spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Enzyme activities were calculated from the linear part of the kinetic curve. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme oxidizing 0.5 μmol of β-NADPH (corresponding to 1 μmol of GSH)/min. To assess levels of intracellular peroxide formation, flow cytometric analysis was carried out using an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-DA (λex = 488, λem = 510) (22.Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (HBL or HaCaT) were cultured to ∼60% confluence in 6-well plates (∼5 × 104 cells). Cell medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS (without Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions) two times, and then PBS (without Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions) containing 5 μm DCFH-DA was added to the cells for 10 min. DCFH-DA was removed, and cells were washed thoroughly with PBS (without Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions) five times. Medium was added back to the cells for experimentation. Cells were incubated with α-MSH 1–13 (varying from 10−11 to 10−6m), forskolin (10−5 and 10−4m), or IBMX (10−4 and 10−3m) for 5 min prior to the addition of hydrogen peroxide (300 μm for the HaCaT cell line, or 600 μmfor the HBL cell line). Reactions were stopped after 15 min by medium removal; cells were washed three times with PBS and detached by incubation with 200 μl of PBS/EDTA (0.02%, 5 min). Cells were collected in a final volume of 1 ml FacsFlow solution (Becton Dickinson) for analysis. Protein concentration was determined by use of the bicinchinonic acid kit (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Data for the GPx enzyme activity were calculated using standard unit values (as described above under “Measurement of Glutathione Peroxidase”). Data for inhibition of GPx activity were expressed as percentage values, where unstimulated enzyme activity was 0% (equivalent to 100% inhibition) and TNF-α/H2O2 stimulated activity was 100% (equivalent to 0% inhibition). Data were analyzed by the Student'st test, and results were expressed as mean ± S.E. In both HBL cutaneous melanoma and HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines the addition of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α caused a transient increase in GPx enzyme activity in comparison with untreated cells. A very similar increase in GPx activity was observed when cells were stimulated exogenously with hydrogen peroxide, and increases in activity were found to be time- and concentration-dependent. A maximum increase in enzyme activity was identified after a 30-min incubation period for HBL cutaneous melanoma cells, when stimulated with either TNF-α (Fig. 1 a) or hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1 b). GPx activity increased 2.2-fold over control levels after 30 min of stimulation with 400 units/ml TNF-α (Fig. 1 a, p = 0.001, n = 3), in comparison with increases of 1.9-fold after a 15-min incubation (p = 0.008, n = 3) and 1.6-fold after a 45-min incubation (p = 0.04, n = 3). When HBL cells were stimulated with 600 μmol/liter hydrogen peroxide, a maximum GPx increase of 2-fold over control levels was observed (Fig.1 b, p = 0.019, n = 3), in comparison with 1.1-fold after 15 min (p = 0.68,n = 3) and 1.6-fold after 45 min (p = 0.05, n = 3). However, GPx activity was observed to be maximum (3.3-fold over control levels) in the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line after a 45-min incubation with TNF-α (400 units/ml) (Fig.1 a, p = 0.001, n = 3). In this cell line, activity was less after a 30-min (1.7-fold,p = 0.100, n = 3) and 60-min incubation (0.81-fold, p = 0.46, n = 3). Similarly, when HaCaT cells were stimulated with hydrogen peroxide (300 μmol/liter) a maximum increase in GPx activity of 3-fold was measured after a 45-min incubation (Fig. 1b, p = 0.010,n = 3). Activity was also found to be lower after 30-min (1.7-fold, p = 0.100, n = 3) and 60-min incubation periods (0.81-fold, p = 0.456,n = 3), respectively. Using the incubation times where maximum GPx activity was achieved, a concentration-dependent increase in activity was observed when cells were stimulated with TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide. This was maximum for HBL cells when stimulated with 900 μmhydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1 c, 2.8-fold, p = 0.01, n = 3) or 400 units/ml TNF-α (Fig.1 d, 2.3-fold, p = 0.0009, n= 3). Maximum GPx activity was measured when HaCaT cells were stimulated with 1200 μm hydrogen peroxide (Fig.1 c, 6.25-fold, p = 0.001, n= 3) or 800 units/ml TNF-α (Fig. 1 d, 3-fold,p = 0.008, n = 3). A significant increase in GPx activity of ∼2-fold was observed for HBL cells using 400 units/ml TNF-α or 600 μm hydrogen peroxide and 400 units/ml TNF-α or 300 μm hydrogen peroxide for HaCaT cells. These respective concentrations of TNF-α and hydrogen peroxide were used for all subsequent investigations. We investigated the ability of four α-MSH peptides to inhibit TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide-stimulated increases in GPx activity, using the respective incubation times determined for each cell type. The four MSH peptides investigated were: (i) α-MSH 1–13, (ii) α-MSH 4–10, (iii) α-MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7], and (iv) α-MSH 11–13. Cells were preincubated for 15 min with the MSH peptides prior to the addition of either TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide. MSH peptides alone did not affect unstimulated cell GPx activity (data not shown), but they did inhibit GPx enzyme activity stimulated by TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide. In general terms, the ability of the MSH peptides to inhibit enzyme activity was similar irrespective of whether the cells were stimulated with TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide. However, the two cell types differed slightly in their response to the peptides α-MSH 4–10 and α-MSH 11–13. The inhibitory data for all MSH peptides are shown in Fig. 2. GPx enzyme activity stimulated by TNF-α in the human HBL melanoma cell line was inhibited by α-MSH 1–13 in a slightly biphasic manner (Fig. 2 a). The most effective inhibitory concentration was 10−10m (84% inhibition, p < 0.0001, n = 3), and it was less effective at 10−11m (51% inhibition, p = 0.0001, n = 3), 10−9m (79% inhibition, p = 0.0001, n = 3), and 10−8m (79% inhibition, p = 0.0001, n = 3). A similar biphasic inhibitory profile for this peptide was also observed when cells were stimulated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2 b), with maximum inhibition observed at 10−10m (83%, p = 0.0003, n = 3). The α-MSH 4–10 peptide also inhibited GPx activity in a biphasic manner when HBL cells were stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 2 a), with maximum inhibition at 10−10m (90%, p < 0.0001,n = 3). Biphasic inhibition was also noted when the cells were stimulated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2 b, with maximum inhibition at 10−10m, 81% inhibition, p = 0.0003, n = 3). In contrast, the “superpotent” peptide α-MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7] was most effective at inhibiting TNF-α-induced GPx activity at 10−12m (Fig. 2 a, 87%, p < 0.0001,n = 3). This peptide was also found to inhibit GPx activity in a biphasic manner, as concentrations of α-MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7] higher than 10−12m were progressively less effective in inhibiting GPx activity (although all concentrations investigated achieved significant inhibition). When HBL cells were stimulated with hydrogen peroxide, the inhibitory profile was broadly similar (Fig.2 b), with 10−12m as the most potent concentration. Higher or lower concentrations were less effective. The α-MSH 11–13 tripeptide also had a biphasic action in inhibiting GPx activity. However, the most effective concentration at inhibiting GPx activity was 10−9m when cells were stimulated with either TNF-α (Fig. 2 a, 78%,p = 0.0002, n = 3) or hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2 b, 95%, p = 0.0001,n = 3). When HaCaT human keratinocytes cells were stimulated with TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide, a similar GPx inhibition was observed with α-MSH 1–13 and α-MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7]. The most effective inhibitory concentration for α-MSH 1–13 was 10−10m when cells were stimulated with either TNF-α (Fig. 2 c, 87% mean inhibition, p < 0.0001, n = 3) or hydrogen peroxide (Fig.2 d, 133% mean inhibition, p < 0.0001,n = 3, this was the only instance when an MSH peptide inhibited unstimulated GPx activity). As noted for the HBL melanoma cell line, inhibition was biphasic in terms of effective concentration, with 10−11, 10−9, and 10−8m being less effective than 10−10m, irrespective of the stimulus (TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide). The α-MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7] peptide was most effective at 10−12m, achieving 100% GPx inhibition (p < 0.0001, n = 3) when stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 2 c) and 74% inhibition (p < 0.0001, n = 3) when stimulated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2 d). In contrast to the biphasic response to α-MSH 4–10 and 11–13 in the HBL melanoma cell line, these peptides were less potent in inhibiting GPx activity in the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. α-MSH 4–10 achieved 62% inhibition (p = 0.0001, n = 3) (Fig.2 c) in inhibiting TNF-α-induced GPx activity at 10−8m. The same concentration was also most effective for inhibiting hydrogen peroxide-induced GPx activity (Fig.2 d, 71% inhibition, p = 0.01,n = 3). A summary of the most effective inhibitory concentrations of each MSH peptide on total GPx activity arising in HBL and HaCaT cells when stimulated with TNF-α or hydrogen peroxide is shown in Table I.Table IComparison of the potency of α-MSH and related peptides in inhibiting TNF-α and hydrogen peroxide stimulated GPx activityPeptideTNF-αH2O2mmα-MSH 1–13HaCaT10−10 (87 ± 17%)***10−10 (133 ± 14%)***HBL10−10 (84 ± 3%)***10−10 (83 ± 10%)***α-MSH 4–10HaCaT10−8 (62 ± 9%)***10−8 (71 ± 9%)***HBL10−10 (90 ± 5%)***10−10 (81 ± 10%)***α-MSH 11–13HaCaT10−8 (89 ± 10%)***10−8 (79 ± 8%)***HBL10−9 (78 ± 10%)***10−9 (95 ± 2%)***α-MSH [Nle4-d-Phe7]HaCaT10−12 (100 ± 7%)***10−12 (74 ± 3%)***HBL10−12 (87 ± 5%)***10−12 (92 ± 6%)***The table shows the concentration of peptide that produced maximum inhibition of TNF-α- and hydrogen peroxide-stimulated GPx activity in HBL melanoma cells and HaCaT keratinocyte cells.

As α-MSH is known to operate through the G-protein activation of cyclic AMP, we substituted forskolin (which directly activates adenylate cyclase independent of the presence of the receptor) or IBMX (an inhibitor of the adenylate cyclase-generating phosphodiesterase, which degrades cyclic AMP) for α-MSH. Forskolin at 10−4mand IBMX at 10−3m both achieved inhibition of 60–80% against TNF-α- and peroxide-stimulated GPx activity in both cells (Table II).Table IIInhibition of glutathione peroxidase by forskolin and IBMXCell treatmentHaCaT keratinocytesHBL melanoma cellsTNF-αH2O2TNF-αH2O2400 units/ml300 μM400 units/ml600 μMIBMX (10−4m)0.67 ± 0.33.3 ± 1.93.5 ± 2.036.7 ± 6.5*IBMX (10−3m)66.8 ± 3.6*55.4 ± 3.5**18.1 ± 2.3*54.2 ± 5.9*Forskolin (10−5m)20.0 ± 3.546.9 ± 3.2**17.8 ± 3.234.2 ± 2.9*Forskolin (10−4m)84.4 ± 5.8**54.4 ± 4.1**62.0 ± 6.8**56.1 ± 6.5*The influence of forskolin and IBMX on TNF-α- or hydrogen peroxide-stimulated GPx activity in HaCaT keratinocytes and HBL melanoma cells.

HBL and HaCaT cells loaded intracellularly with DCFH-DA were compared with unloaded cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Typical results are shown in Fig. 3 for HaCaT keratinocytes, where an increase in basal fluorescence was observed (very similar results were obtained for HBL melanoma cells (not shown)). Cells were then incubated exogenously with hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis demonstrated reproducible increases in intracellular fluorescence after exposure, interpreted as an increase in the level of peroxide species (potentially as lipid peroxide, organic peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide species) within the cell (Fig.3 a) (we were unable to detect any significant effect of TNF-α on peroxide accumulation in either cell line). When cells were preincubated with α-MSH for 5 min, followed by a 15-min incubation period with hydrogen peroxide, intracellular fluorescence compared with hydrogen peroxide alone stimulation was found to decrease (Fig. 3 b). Fig.4 shows a comparison of the sensitivity of HaCaT and HBL cells to α-MSH. For HaCaT cells a decrease of ∼50% in fluorescence was observed using concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 10−8m α-MSH (Fig.4 a); concentrations greater than 10−8m were less effective. In HBL cells the α-MSH inhibition of peroxide accumulation was concentration-dependent in that increasing concentrations of α-MSH increased the inhibition to a maximum of 50% achieved at 10−8m (Fig.4 b). Again, higher concentrations of α-MSH were less effective. When forskolin or IBMX were substituted for α-MSH, both were effective in inhibiting the peroxide-initiated increase in intracellular fluorescence in a manner similar to that observed for α-MSH (Fig. 3 c). As with the inhibition of stimulated GPx activity, the concentrations of forskolin and IBMX required for effective inhibition were 10−3 and 10−4m, respectively (Table III), for both HBL and HaCaT cell lines. Forskolin at 10−4m achieved greater than 60% inhibition of the response to hydrogen peroxide.Figure 4Effect of α-MSH on hydrogen peroxide accumulation in human HBL cutaneous melanoma cells and human HaCaT keratinocytes loaded with DCFH-DA.

The following findings implicate the Tec/Bmx nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family in the regulation of RhoA and SRF by G12α/G13α: kinase-defective Bmx inhibits SRF activation by GTPase-deficient forms of G12α/G13α, GTPase-deficient G12α/G13α stimulates Tec kinase activity, and Tec kinases synergize with GTPase-deficient G12α/G13α to activate SRF via RhoA (10Mao J.

Thus, in cell types that express PYK2, GPCR signaling by triggering PYK2 activation could enhance SRE-mediated transcription through TCF-dependent and -independent pathways. To examine this possibility, we used HeLa cells, a cell line that contains significant endogenous levels of PYK2. Surprisingly we found a requirement for PYK2 in SRF activation triggered by engagement of the M1R or by expression of GTPase-deficient G12α and G13α. In the course of these studies, we observed that GTP-G13α potently stimulates PYK2 kinase activity and that it associates with PYK2 in vivo.

The antibodies against the following were purchased: PYK2 and Rho (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA); PYK2-Y402, PYK2-Y579, PYK2-Y580, and PYK2-Y881 (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA); HA and Myc (Babco, Richmond, CA); FLAG (Sigma); G12α, G13α, Gi/Go/Gt/Gz, and RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). HeLa and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The collected cells were lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation, 20 μl of the supernatant was tested for β-galactosidase activity using galactan chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) or luciferase activity using a luciferase substrate (Promega). For the CAT assays, the transfected HeLa cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw, and CAT activity was determined using a previously described liquid scintillation assay (20Neumann J.R. Morency A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-450Google Scholar). Data from all the transfection assays were normalized using the activity of a control reporter gene. HeLa cell lysates were prepared using a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 along with a mixture of protease inhibitors for 20 min on ice. The detergent-insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to pure nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 10% milk in TTBS (Tween 20, Tris, base, salt) for 1 h and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of the primary antibody in 5% milk and 0.05% sodium azide in TTBS overnight. The blots were washed twice with TTBS before the addition of a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1:1500 in TTBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. Following a 1-h incubation, the blot was washed twice with TTBS and then incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The co-immunoprecipitations were performed using lysates (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate plus protease inhibitors) prepared from HeLa cells co-expressing HA-G12αQL or HA-G13αQL in conjunction with Myc-PYK2. Anti-Myc or -HA monoclonal antibodies were added, and the immunoprecipitates were collected with the appropriate secondary antibody-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal Corp., Lake Success, NY). They were washed three times in lysis buffer, twice in lysis buffer with 0.5m NaCl, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibody. Alternatively, HeLa cells were treated for 20 min with AlF4− or not and washed twice using phosphate-buffered saline prior to the addition of lysis buffer. PYK2 immunoprecipitates were collected and washed as above prior to fractionation on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the G13α-specific antiserum. PYK2-immunoprecipitates were washed three times with kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors. After these washes and six additional washes (three with a LiCl wash buffer (500 mmLiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and three with kinase reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2)), the kinase assays were performed. poly(Glu, Tyr) (4:1) (Sigma) was used as a substrate. The RhoA translocation experiment was done by a modification of a previously published procedure (10Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells transfected with PYK2 or PYK2 KD expression vector were incubated in a hypotonic buffer containing 20 mm Tris and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice, lysed by several cycles of freezing and thawing, and sonicated for five 10-s intervals. To make the membrane preparations, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 52,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were washed three times with the hypotonic buffer and dissolved in sample buffer. The proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 6% (m/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.0125% (m/v) deoxycholate. Equal amount of proteins from the membrane and the supernatant were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were detected by the PYK2- and RhoA-specific antibodies, respectively. Bacterially expressed GST-Rhotekin Rho binding domain protein (GST-RBD) was purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm)-induced BL21 cells previously transformed with the appropriate plasmid (21Ren X-D Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). The transfected HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and lysis buffer was added (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethlylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was spun at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min, and the cleared lysate was incubated with GST-RBD beads (25 μg) on ice for 90 min. The beads were washed four times with Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethlylsulfonyl fluoride. The wash buffer was removed, and SDS sample buffer was added. The samples were fractionated on 13% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting for Rho. To determine which activated G-proteins enhance SRE-dependent gene expression in HeLa cells, we transfected constructs that directed the expression of GTPase-deficient forms of Gα or β1 and γ2 along with a reporter gene that contains five copies of the SRE and a minimal promoter fused to luciferase. Similar to the results reported with NIH 3T3 cells (9Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), GTPase-deficient G12α and G13α potently induced SRE-luciferase activity (Fig.1 A). G12αQL and G13αQL both increased the reporter gene activity more than 200-fold compared with the basal activity. In contrast, GqαQL induced only a 10-fold increase, and the other stimuli had minimal effects, yet GqαQL and GsαQL substantially elevated the intracellular levels of inositol phosphates and cAMP, respectively, and Gi2αQL reduced intracellular levels of cAMP (data not shown). PYK2 expression also activated the SRE-luciferase reporter construct. While not as efficient as the GTPase deficient forms of G12α or G13α, PYK2 induced a 20–25-fold increase in SRE-luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B). Signaling to the SRF by activators of heterotrimeric G-proteins requires RhoA, while c-src triggers SRF activation through a RhoA-independent pathway (10Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether PYK2 induces SRE reporter gene activation by activating RhoA, we simultaneously expressed the botulinum C3 exoenzyme. The toxin ADP-ribosylates RhoA at asparagine 41, thereby deactivating it and preventing the activation of downstream effectors (5Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the co-expression of the C3 toxin markedly impaired the ability of PYK2 to activate the SRE reporter construct, indicating a requirement for Rho activation (Fig. 1 B). This result suggested that PYK2 activates the SRE through an SRF-dependent mechanism, a possibility we tested using a TCF-insensitive SRE-CAT construct (5Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). TCF can not bind because of a mutation in the TCF binding site (pSREmutL). PYK2 readily activated this construct (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, C3 toxin and a specific RhoA inhibitor, which inhibits the dissociation of GDP from RhoA (RhoGDI) (19Leffers H. Nielsen M.S. Andersen A.H. Honore B. Madsen P. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), both inhibited the activation. As expected, both C3 toxin and RhoGDI blocked activation of the reporter gene by p115 RhoGEF, a Rho exchange factor whose expression activates endogenous Rho (Fig. 1 D). Thus, in HeLa cells, PYK2 expression activates the SRE reporter gene at least in part through an SRF- and RhoA-dependent pathway. If PYK2 participates in G12α- and G13α-induced SRE transcription in HeLa cells, a kinase inactive form of PYK2 (PYK2 KD) should inhibit the response. The same construct attenuates SAPK and p38 activation by stress signals (17Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J.

Hypertension. 1998; 32: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), thereby implicating PYK2 in these signaling pathways. We found that the co-expression of PYK2 KD significantly impaired G12αQL- and G13αQL-induced activation of the SRE-reporter (Fig.2 A). In both instances, the PYK2 KD construct inhibited SRE activation nearly as well as did the C3 toxin. A similar analysis of M1R signaling to the SRE revealed a similar inhibition (Fig. 2 B). To verify that M1R signaling triggered the SRE reporter through a G12/G13-linked signaling pathway in HeLa cells, we repeated the M1R signaling experiments in the presence of the RGS domain of p115 RhoGEF (p115 RGS), a GTPase-activating protein for G12α and G13α (7Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The expression of p115 RGS nicely blocked the activation of the SRE reporter construct induced by signaling through the M1R (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that GPCRs, which couple to G12α and G13α, can activate SRF-dependent transcription through a PYK2-dependent pathway. While M1R signaling leads to PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced PYK2 kinase activity (13Felsch J.S. Cachero T.G. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the effects of G12/G13 on PYK2 have not been previously reported. To examine their effects, we transfected the PYK2 expression vector in the presence or absence of constructs that directed the expression of G12αQL or G13αQL and subjected immunoprecipitated PYK2 to an in vitro kinase using an exogenous substrate, poly(Glu, Tyr) (4:1). Both G12αQL and G13αQL enhanced PYK2 kinase activity toward the exogenous substrate; however, G13αQL induced a higher level (Fig.3 A). We also noted a phosphorylated band that migrated at a rate identical to that of PYK2 in the lysates from stimulated cells. To directly determine if the stimuli triggered PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, we analyzed the PYK2 immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. While G13α and M1R signaling enhanced PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, G12α had a very modest effect. The expression of G13α or G12α did not alter PYK2 expression levels. By immunoblotting with PYK2 phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (Fig. 3 B), we discovered that G13αQL led to the phosphorylation of PYK2 on residues Tyr402, a major autophosphorylation site and site of interaction with Src (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar); Tyr579 and Tyr580in the kinase domain; and Tyr881 in the proline-rich region. In contrast, G12α failed to induce high levels of reactivity with the antibodies. These results suggest that while both G13α and G12α activate PYK2, G13α is more efficient. The inhibition of M1R, G12αQL, and G13αQL triggered SRE reporter gene activity by PYK2 KD did not delineate where in the signaling pathway PYK2 functions. However, the dependence of PYK2-induced SRE reporter gene activity upon RhoA activation implied a role for PYK2 upstream of RhoA. To test that prediction, we examined whether the PYK2 KD construct inhibited RhoA-induced SRE reporter gene activity. We found that the same concentration of PYK2 KD that inhibited G13αQL-induced SRE reporter gene activity by 75% only reduced RhoA-induced reporter gene activity by 10–20% (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, G13αQL enhanced PYK2 kinase activity independent of RhoA activation, because C3 toxin co-expression had no effect on the PYK2 kinase activity (data not shown). Since a tyrosine phosphorylation event precedes the translocation of RhoA to the plasma membrane (23Keller J. Schmidt M. Hussein B. Rumenapp U. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), PYK2 expression could alter the intracellular location of RhoA (Fig. 4 B). Indeed, the expression of PYK2 but not PYK2 KD in COS-7 cells enhanced the amount of endogenous RhoA found in a crude membrane fraction. In contrast, neither the wild type PYK2 nor the kinase defective form altered the amount of Giα in the membrane preparations. This led us to examine whether PYK2 expression increased the amount of activated Rho in HeLa cells. To do so, we used the RBD of Rhotekin to affinity-precipitate GTP-Rho (21Ren X-D Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) from HeLa cells lysates expressing RhoA and PYK2 (Fig. 4 C). As controls, we performed similar experiments with PYK2 KD or p115 RhoGEF. We found that PYK2 KD did not alter the basal amount of affinity-precipitated GTP-Rho; however, both wild type PYK2 and the positive control, p115 RhoGEF, increased the amount. Thus, the expression of PYK2 in HeLa cells results in the translocation and the activation of a portion of the cellular pool of RhoA. Finally, to verify the specificity of p115 RGS and to analyze the effect of RhoA on PYK2 activation, we expressed GTPase-deficient forms of G12α, G13α, Gqα, RhoA, and M1R in the presence of PYK2 and p115 RGS or not. By binding to GTP-G12α and GTP-G13α, p115 RGS should inhibit their ability to stimulate downstream effectors (7Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). We found that co-expression of p115 RGS blocked PYK2 activation by GTPase-deficient forms of G13α and G12α but not by GTPase-deficient Gqα (Fig.5). Suggesting that in HeLa cells G12/G13 activation was important for M1R signaling to PYK2, p115 RGS markedly inhibited PYK2 activation. Consistent with PYK2 acting predominantly upstream of RhoA, activated RhoA had a minimal effect on PYK2 kinase activity. The activation of G13α could either directly or indirectly lead to PYK2 activation. If G13α directly stimulated PYK2, we should be able to detect an interaction between the two proteins. To test whether the two proteins interact, we co-transfected HeLa cells with G13αQL and PYK2. G13αQL was epitope-tagged with HA, which was useful for immunoprecipitating the protein but not for immunoblotting. We analyzed either HA or FLAG (control) antibody immunoprecipitates for the presence of PYK2 using a Myc tag-specific antibody, which recognized Myc-tagged PYK2 (Fig.6 A). We found that the HA-G13αQL immunoprecipitates contained readily detectable PYK2, while the control FLAG immunoprecipitates did not. In similar experiments using HA-tagged G12αQL and PYK-2, the two proteins did not co-immunoprecipitate. We confirmed the presence of G12αQL and G13αQL in the immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with G-protein specific antibodies. Conversely, we examined Myc-Pyk2 immunoprecipitates for the presence of G12αQL or G13αQL via immunoblotting with G-protein-specific antibodies (Fig. 6 B). Again, G13αQL readily co-immunoprecipitated with PYK2, while G12αQL did not. These results indicate that GTP-G13α can associatein vivo with PYK2. To provide better evidence that this is the case, we determined whether G-protein activation leads to a detectable G13α-PYK2 complex in nontransfected HeLa cells. We used a nonspecific activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins, treatment with aluminum fluoride, to stimulate endogenous heterotrimeric G-proteins and then examined PYK2 immunoprecipitates for the presence of G13α by immunoblotting (Fig.6 C). We found a clear band reactive with the G13α antisera, which migrated with the appropriate molecular mass when we used cells that had been treated with aluminum fluoride for 30 min prior to lysis. Control immunoprecipitates failed to contain any such band. Thus, the activation of G13α probably leads to its transient association with PYK2 in PYK2-expressing cells. Three sets of observations support our conclusion that G13α can use PYK2 to link to downstream signaling pathways. First, in HeLa cells, overexpression of either PYK2 or G13αQL activates SRF through a RhoA-dependent mechanism, and a kinase-inactive form of PYK2 blocks G13αQL from inducing SRE-dependent transcription. This inhibition appears specific, since the kinase-inactive PYK2 does not block the triggering of SRE-dependent transcription by RhoA. Second, expression of GTPase-deficient G13α activates PYK2 as assessed by anin vitro kinase assay using a known PYK2 substrate and by immunoblotting with phosphorylation state-specific antibodies. The latter verifies that G13α triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the major PYK2 autophosphorylation site. Furthermore, the RGS domain of p115 RhoGEF impairs PYK2 activation by either M1R or G13αQL. Third, GTP-G13α and PYK2 interact. In cells expressing PYK2 and G13αQL, the two proteins readily co-immunoprecipitate. In contrast, a similar interaction did not occur when we substituted G12αQL for G13αQL. Confirming that a physiologically relevant G13α/PYK2 interaction occurs, the activation of endogenous heterotrimeric G-proteins leads to a rapid association between G13α and PYK2. While the easy detection of G13α with PYK2 indicates that PYK2 could be a direct G13α effector, the activation of PYK2 may be secondary to other signaling pathways that G13α stimulates. We are currently mapping the regions in PYK2 necessary to detect the interaction with G13α. We also find that G12αQL expression activates PYK2 and that PYK2 KD interferes with the activity of an SRE reporter following G12αQL expression in HeLa cells. G12αQL induces a very high level of SRE reporter gene activity even greater than that we observe with G13αQL. However, an interaction between G12αQL and PYK2 sufficient to allow the proteins to co-immunoprecipitate does not occur, suggesting a fundamental difference in how G12α and G13α activate PYK2. Further studies will be needed to illuminate how G12α and G13α activate PYK2. A recent study implicates Tec/Bmx nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in the regulation of Rho and serum response factor by G12α/G13α (10Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results parallel our work with PYK2 in HeLa cells. Several explanations could reconcile the two studies. Since a kinase defective Bmx more readily impairs SRF activation by G12αQL (10Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), while kinase-deficient PYK2 better inhibits SRF activation by G13αQL (our data), G12α may preferentially use Tec kinases to activate the SRF, while G13α uses PYK2 for a similar purpose. Because different cell types express varying amounts of the Tec kinases and PYK2, in some cell types G13α may largely use PYK2 and in others it may use Tec kinases to activate SRF, whereas in some cells it may use both kinases. Arguing that both kinases may contribute to SRF activation, Tec kinase or PYK2 overexpression enhances SRE reporter activity significantly less than does GTPase-deficient G12α/G13α. To examine the potential for Tec kinases to activate the SRF in HeLa cells, we have tested whether Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) enhances transcription of the SRE-luciferase reporter. Arguing that expression of BTK should be functionally equivalent to the expression of other Tec kinases, Bmx, Txk, Tec, and Itk all reconstitute BTK signaling in cell lines deficient for BTK (24Tomlinson M.G. Kurosaki T. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H. Johnston J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13577-13585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We find that a constitutively active form of BTK induces only a 2–3-fold increase in reporter gene activity, while wild type PYK2 induces a 20-fold enhancement; however, the combination of PYK2 and BTK leads to a 60-fold increase. Indicating that is not downstream of BTK, the expression of PYK2 KD does not block SRE activation by BTK. 2C-S. Shi, unpublished observations. How do Tec kinases and PYK2 lead to Rho activation and hence the SRF? The basal activity of Tec kinase and PYK2 in NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells leads to SRF activation in the respective cell type (Ref. 10Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and our data). In both instances, the activation of SRF requires functional kinase domains and Rho activation, implying the need for the phosphorylation of downstream effectors and for GTP-Rho. Both Tec kinase and PYK2 enhance the translocation of Rho to COS-7 cell membranes, results consistent with the inhibition of Rho translocation by tryosine kinase inhibitors (23Keller J. Schmidt M. Hussein B. Rumenapp U. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tec overexpression induces cytoskeletal reorganization in NIH 3T3 cells (10Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and PYK2 overexpression increases the amount of GTP-Rho in HeLa cells. Thus, both Tec kinase and PYK2 can cause Rho activation. RhoGEFs, RhoGDIs, and RhoGAPs control Rho activity (GTP- versus GDP-bound state) by triggering the exchange of GTP for GDP, inhibiting the release of GDP from RhoA, or by enhancing the rate that GTP-Rho hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 25Machide M. Mano H. Todokoro K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 619-625PubMed Google Scholar). G13α itself can stimulate Rho by activating RhoGEFs. Tec kinases and PYK2 or one of their targets could regulate Rho activity by potentiating G13α's activation of the exchange factors. While the Tec TH domain binds to VAV, a hematopoietic specific exchange factor for RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (25Machide M. Mano H. Todokoro K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 619-625PubMed Google Scholar), no evidence currently links PYK2 to RhoGEFs. Further studies will determine whether PYK2 enhances their activity. Alternatively, PYK2 or Tec kinase could either directly or indirectly deactivate RhoGDIs or RhoGAPs, which would enhance the likelihood of RhoA being GTP-bound and able to activate downstream effectors. Besides involvement in SRF activation by G13α in some cell types, PYK2 could also participate in G13α's induction of SAPKs. G12α and G13α activate SAPK via different mechanisms depending upon the cell type. In COS-7 cells, they activate SAPK through Cdc42, while in NIH 3T3 cells (26Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar) and COS-1 cells Ras is critical (27Prasad M.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells, a dominant negative form of RhoA and C3 exoenzyme blocks G12α-mediated SAPK activation as does C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), suggesting the additional involvement of a Src kinase (28Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4425-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, a dominant negative Ras inhibits G12α-mediated SAPK activation, but it fails to do so in HEK 293 cells, where a dominant negative form of Rac does so (29Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These differences probably arise because of the differing availability of downstream mediators of G12α and G13α signaling. In those cells that express PYK2, we would expect that G13α activation should lead to PYK2 and Src kinase activation, both of which can contribute to SAPK activation. Activation of certain heterotrimeric G-proteins causes neurite retraction and cell rounding through a RhoA-dependent pathway (30Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, the induction of neurite retraction and cell rounding by GTPase-deficient G12α, G13α, or Gqα also depends upon RhoA (31Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 blocks the morphological changes triggered by GTPase-deficient G13α or Gqα but not by G12α, while the inhibition of protein kinase C or elimination of extracellular calcium inhibits the morphological changes induced by GTPase-deficient Gqα but not by G12α or G13α (32Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lysophosphatidic acid induces neurite retraction through a G12/G13-initiated pathway that requires tyrosine kinase activity (33Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Since PC12 and neuronal cells express high levels of PYK2 (32Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), its activation by Gqα via the release of intracellular calcium or by G13α through a yet unknown mechanism could account for these results. Finally, in PC12 cells transfected with the α-1A adrenergic receptor, norepinephrine activates mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and triggers PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation independent of calcium release or protein kinase C activation (34Berts A. Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results suggest that either GTP-Gq can stimulate PYK2 through a pathway not dependent upon calcium release or protein kinase C or that the α-1A adrenergic receptor uses G12α/G13α to activate PYK2. Poised to receive activation signals from GPCRs both via the activation of Gqα and G13α and located at a critical juncture in many signaling pathways, PYK2 processes upstream information to coordinate the activation of downstream signaling pathways, which alter the activity of transcription factors such as SRF and TCF. Interestingly, also subject to many of the same input signals including Gqα and G12α/G13α, the Tec kinases link to many of the same downstream signaling pathways that PYK2 links to. Whether PYK2 and Tec kinases cross-regulate each other is an interesting question for future studies. We thank Mary Rust for editorial assistance and Dr. Anthony Fauci for support."

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), most members of the FGF family are broad-spectrum mitogens, and several also stimulate various processes such as cell migration, angiogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and neuroprotection (12.Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). FGFs interact with three different types of binding proteins. These include a cystein-rich receptor of as yet unknown function, which binds various types of FGFs with high affinity (13.Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which bind FGFs with low affinities, although this interaction is essential for the binding of these factors to their high-affinity receptors (12.Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). There are four different genes encoding high-affinity transmembrane receptors. These receptors, designated as FGF receptors 1 to 4 (FGFR1–4), are characterized by the presence of two or three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in the extracellular region and a tyrosine kinase domain in the intracellular region of the receptor (14.Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). They are responsible for FGF-mediated signal transduction (14.Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Additional diversity in the FGF receptor family is generated by alternative splicing. Of particular importance are splice variants that differ in the second half of the third Ig-like domain, since these variants differ in their ligand binding specificity (15.Miki T. Bottaro D.P.

By analogy to FGFR2, IIIb and IIIc splice variants have also been identified for FGFR3 (17.Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas this type of alternative splicing does not occur with the FGFR4 transcripts (22.Vainikka S. Partanen J. Bellosta P. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Basilico C. Jaye M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, three different exons (designated IIIa, IIIb and IIIc) that might encode possible alternatives within the third Ig-like domain are present in both the human and murine FGFR1 genes, and receptors including the IIIa and the IIIc exon have been identified (23.Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The receptor that contains exclusively the IIIa exon is a soluble variant, which binds FGF-2 with higher affinity than FGF-1 (24.Duan D.-S.R. Werner S. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16076-16080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGFR1-IIIc is a transmembrane receptor that binds FGF-1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 (20.Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). By contrast, a full-length receptor cDNA, which includes sequences encoding the IIIb exon of FGFR1 has as yet not been isolated. However, mRNAs encoding the FGFR1-IIIb exon have been found in mice and humans using RNase protection assays and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 23.Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These mRNAs encode the complete extracellular domain of FGFR1-IIIb, but it has as yet not been possible to demonstrate the presence of sequences encoding the intracellular domain. Thus it has been unclear whether FGFR1-IIIb is a soluble or a transmembrane receptor and whether it is a functional receptor for FGFs. To gain some insight into the properties of a putative FGFR1-IIIb, we had previously used the genomic sequence of the human receptor gene to predict the coding potential of the IIIb exon, which was then incorporated in place of the IIIc exon in a FGFR1-IIIc cDNA. The extent of the IIIb exon was based on the strong sequence homology between the IIIb exons of FGFR1 and FGFR2. Expression of this chimeric receptor in rat L6 smooth muscle myoblasts, which lack endogenous FGF receptors, and subsequent binding studies demonstrated that this receptor binds FGF-1 with high affinity and FGF-2 with lower affinity (16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Subsequently, binding of FGF-3 and -10 to this receptor was demonstrated (19.Mathieu M. Chatelain E. Ornitz D. Bresnick J. Mason I. Kiefer P. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24197-24203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25.Lu W. Luo Y. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

Here we describe the isolation of an authentic full-length murine FGFR1-IIIb cDNA from a mouse skin wound cDNA library. We demonstrate that the protein encoded by this cDNA is a functional transmembrane receptor for FGF-1, -2, and -10. FGF-7 also binds the receptor but does not activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or induce DNA synthesis. RNA isolation was performed according to Ref. 26.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63019) Google Scholar. RNase protection analysis was performed as described previously (27.Werner S. Weinberg W. Liao X. Peters K.G. Blessing M. Yuspa S.H. Weiner R.I. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA (20 μg) were used for all protection assays. As a loading control, 1 μg of all RNA samples was loaded on a 1% agarose gel before hybridization and stained with ethidium bromide. All protection assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate with different sets of RNA. Probe DNAs: a 137-base pair (bp) fragment specific for the murine FGFR1-IIIb exon (16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), a 361-bp fragment corresponding to the complete third Ig-like domain of murine FGFR1-IIIc (described in Ref. 16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and a 271-bp fragment corresponding to the third Ig-like domain of murine FGFR2-IIIb (described in Ref. 27.Werner S. Weinberg W.

In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (28.Mahmood R. Mason I. Sharpe P. Mason I. Methods in Molecular Biology/ Molecular Embryology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 623-633Google Scholar), except that digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes and hybridization buffers were prepared as for whole embryoin situ hybridizations (29.Shamim H. Mahmood R. Logan C. Doherty P. Lumsden A. Mason I. Development. 1999; 126: 945-959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following hybridization, sections were washed in 4× SSC, TNE (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA), low stringency wash (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% SDS) and high stringency wash (50% formamide, 2× SSC) according to Ref. 28.Mahmood R. Mason I. Sharpe P. Mason I. Methods in Molecular Biology/ Molecular Embryology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 623-633Google Scholar. Slides were then washed in TBST buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 0.027 m KCl, 0.025m Tris-HCl, 0.1% Tween-20), and nonspecific binding of antibody was blocked by incubating in 1% sheep serum (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) in TBST for 1 h. Incubation in anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate antiserum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was carried out overnight at 4 °C in TBST. Sections were then equilibrated in NTMT buffer (0.01m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 0.05m MgCl2, 01.% Tween-20), and the color reaction was developed in NTMT containing 0.25 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.175 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. When the desired intensity had been obtained, slides were washed in TBST, dehydrated, and mounted in Depex (Merck). To isolate the full-length FGFR1-IIIb cDNA, we screened murine cDNA libraries from normal and wounded mouse dorsal skin (30.Munz B. Frank S. Hübner G. Olsen E. Werner S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31.Madlener M. Werner S. Gene. 1997; 202: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the FGFR1-IIIb exon-specific probe described above using standard procedures. The longest insert was completely sequenced in both orientations. In addition, exon IIIb and 100–200 bp upstream and downstream of this exon were sequenced in four shorter cDNAs. The full-length FGFR1-IIIb cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector in which the FGFR1 cDNA is driven by the simian virus 40 early promoter. Early passage rat L6 skeletal muscle myoblasts (ATCC CRL 1458) were subsequently co-transfected with this expression plasmid and a vector containing the neomycin resistance gene (pSV2neo) using the Lipofectin transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 800 μg/ml geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant colonies were isolated and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of FGFR1 using a polyclonal antiserum directed against an intracellular peptide of FGFR1 (15.Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M.-L. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and an alkaline phosphatase detection system. Tunicamycin (Sigma), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (dissolved in Me2SO) was added to the cell culture media at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. The same volume of Me2SO was used as a control. Cells were harvested before and 3, 6, and 24 h after addition of tunicamycin and analyzed by Western blotting. Recombinant human FGF-1, -2, and -7 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant human FGF-10 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described previously (32.Jimenez P.A. Rampy M.A. J. Surg. Res. 1999; 81: 238-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). FGF receptor binding studies were performed as described (16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Briefly, FGFR- and vector-transfected L6 cells were seeded into 1-cm wells and incubated with 100,000 cpm of125I-labeled FGF-1 (specific activity, 1179 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and increasing concentrations of nonlabeled FGF-1, -2, -7, or -10 at 0 °C in binding medium (DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.1), and 15 U of heparin per ml). After 4 h, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and twice with PBS containing 2m NaCl. They were subsequently solubilized, and125I was quantified by gamma counting. Transfected L6 cells were grown to confluency in 6-cm Petri dishes, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 750,000 cpm of radiolabeled FGF-1 in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor (5 and 1 μg/ml FGF-10; 150 and 50 ng/ml FGF-1). Binding and washing conditions were as described for binding assays. After washing, the cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were incubated 30 min longer at 4 °C. The cross-linker was then removed, and the cells were solubilized in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 125I-Labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. To determine mitogen-activated kinase activity in response to FGFs, we used the p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Briefly, FGFR-transfected L6 cells and vector-transfected cells were grown to 70% confluency in 10-cm Petri dishes in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum. After a 20-h incubation in serum-free medium, cells were treated for 7 min with 10 ng/ml FGF-1, -2, -7, or -10, respectively. After washing with PBS on ice, they were lysed and sonicated. Lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant stored at −80 °C. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using immobilized phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody. The pellet was washed and incubated in the presence of ATP with Elk-1 fusion protein. Phosphorylated fusion protein was detected using Western blotting with an antibody directed against Phospho-Elk-1(Ser383) and an ECL chemiluminescence detection system. The blot was reprobed with an antibody directed against total Elk-1 protein to prove the presence of equal amounts of Elk-1 protein in each reaction mixture. 30,000 cells per well were seeded in 24-well dishes in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 2 days the medium was replaced with DMEM/0.5% FBS. 24 h later the medium was changed again and the cells were incubated for 16 h in DMEM/0.5% FBS containing 0.01–100 ng/ml FGF-1, -2, -7, or -10, respectively. DNA synthesis was then measured by labeling cultures with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 5 Ci/mmol)/well for 3 h. At the end of the labeling period, the medium was removed and each well was washed twice with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 15 min in 5% trichloroacetic acid. After aspiration, 750 μl of 0.25 N NaOH/0.1% SDS was added per well and the plates were incubated on a rocker for 20 min. 500 μl of solubilized cells were counted in a3H channel after neutralization by addition of 50 μl of 6 N HCl. In an attempt to isolate the full-length cDNA of murine FGFR1-IIIb, we first determined the optimal source for the corresponding mRNA. For this purpose, we performed RNase protection assays with RNAs from different adult mouse tissues. A riboprobe corresponding to the genomic sequence of the putative IIIb exon was used as a probe. As demonstrated in Fig.1 (upper panel), FGFR1-IIIb was expressed at the highest levels in the dermis and the epidermis of mouse tail skin as well as in the brain. Furthermore, high levels were detected in dorsal and ventral skin of mice (data not shown). In addition to these tissues, low levels of FGFR1-IIIb mRNA were detected in the kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, testis, and intestine. This expression pattern was strikingly different from that of FGFR1-IIIc, which was not expressed in the epidermis, but at equally high levels in the dermis, brain, kidney, lung, and the heart, and at lower levels in skeletal muscle, testis, liver, and intestine (Fig. 1,middle panel). FGFR2-IIIb mRNAs were found at particularly high levels in lung and in the epidermis, and at lower levels in intestine and in the dermal compartment of mouse tail skin, where it is present in hair follicle keratinocytes (33.Danilenko D.M. Ring B.D. Yanagihara D. Benson W. Wiemann B. Starnes C.O. Pierce G.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar). 2S. Werner, unpublished data. These results demonstrate a differential expression of the two FGFR1 splice variants and of the IIIb variant of FGFR2 and, therefore, suggest that a skin or a brain library is useful for the isolation of the full-length cDNA. To localize the FGFR1-IIIb transcripts in adult skin and brain we performed in situ hybridization with the FGFR1-IIIb-specific probe described above. As shown in Fig. 2, Aand B, this type of receptor was expressed at particularly high levels in sebaceous glands. Surprisingly, not all of these glands but only certain lobes expressed this receptor isoform. Thus FGFR1-IIIb expression might reflect a specific functional status of sebaceous glands. In the brain, the highest levels of FGFR1-IIIb transcripts were detected in dentate gyrus neurons of the hippocampus (Fig.2 C) and in the granular cells of the cerebellum (Fig.2 D). As a control, parallel sections were hybridized to other FGF and FGFR probes that gave distinct and different expression patterns (data not shown). These results demonstrate a unique distribution of FGFR1-IIIb, which is strikingly different to that of other FGF receptor variants. For the isolation of the full- length FGFR1-IIIb cDNA, we first screened a murine skin cDNA library (30.Munz B. Frank S. Hübner G. Olsen E. Werner S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One clone obtained was identified as a partial cDNA. Upon screening of a mouse cDNA library generated from RNA of 1- and 5-day full thickness excisional wounds (31.Madlener M. Werner S. Gene. 1997; 202: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), additional cDNAs were isolated. Sequencing of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the inserts revealed that 50% of the cDNAs encoded FGFR1, whereas the others encoded FGFR2. The longest cDNA corresponding to FGFR1 included the published 5′- and 3′-ends of murine FGFR1 (34.Mansukhani A. Moscatelli D. Talarico D. Levytska V. Basilico C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4378-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This cDNA was sequenced and shown to include a complete open reading frame, which should encode a full-length transmembrane receptor with two extracellular Ig-like domains. The DNA sequence was identical to that published for murine FGFR1-IIIc (34.Mansukhani A. Moscatelli D. Talarico D. Levytska V. Basilico C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4378-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), except for differences in the region encoding the second half of the third Ig-like domain (Fig.3; GenBank™ accession number AF176552). This part of the clone was found to be derived from the predicted IIIb exon region, and its sequence was verified in four independent partial cDNAs derived from either skin or wound skin cDNA libraries (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, the region of sequence that differs from that of FGFR1-IIIc encompasses the region used as a probe for both the library screen and RNase protection assays and extends further at the 3′-end. Therefore, the third Ig-like domain of this receptor is composed of a 5′ region common to both FGFR1-IIIc and FGFR1-IIIb and a 3′ region that is different in both variants. Interestingly, the 3′-end of the unique IIIb exon encodes one additional amino acid compared with the artificially constructed FGFR1-IIIb (V) and one amino acid that is different in these receptors (K versus A). This means that the IIIb and IIIc exons share the encoded sequence WLTV, but then the IIIb exon ends with six extra amino acids while the IIIc encodes only two. A comparison of the full-length cDNA with the genomic sequence of murine FGFR1 that follows the IIIb exon (16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) revealed the use of nucleotides 1195–1202 of this sequence (AG↓GTAATG) as a splice site. To determine whether the new cDNA encodes a full-length transmembrane receptor, we inserted the cDNA into a eukaryotic expression vector in which expression is driven by the SV40 promoter. This construct was subsequently used for the stable transfection of rat L6 skeletal muscle myoblasts, which lack endogenous FGF receptors. By Western blot analysis using total cell lysates with a polyclonal antiserum directed against the intracellular juxtamembrane region of FGFR1, several cell lines were identified that expressed receptor proteins of 100–130 kDa (Fig. 4 A) (16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These proteins were not detected in vector-transfected control cells, indicating that they represent FGFR1-specific proteins. The diffuse character of these bands might result from glycosylation of FGFR proteins. To address this question we incubated these cells in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. This treatment resulted in a time-dependent disappearance of the 100- to 130-kDa bands. However, a protein of approximately 85 kDa appeared upon tunicamycin treatment that corresponds to the expected size of the nonglycosylated receptor. This result demonstrates that FGFR1-IIIb is a glycosylated transmembrane protein and not a soluble receptor. To determine if FGFR1-IIIb is able to bind FGF, we incubated the transfected L6 cells with 125I-FGF-1 in the presence or absence of an excess of FGF-1 or FGF-10. Radiolabeled FGF-1 was chosen because it binds with high affinity to all known FGF receptors (20.Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). A complex of approximately 140–160 kDa was formed when125I-FGF-1 was cross-linked to cells expressing murine FGFR1-IIIb (Fig. 4 B). This size correlates with the expected size of a complex between FGF-1 (16 kDa) and FGFR1-IIIb. This band completely disappeared in the presence of an excess of unlabeled FGF-1, whereas only a reduction in the intensity of this band was found in the presence of an excess of FGF-10 (Fig. 4 B). This result indicates that FGFR1-IIIb binds FGF-1 with higher affinity than it does FGF-10. The ligand binding specificity of FGFR1-IIIb was investigated in comparison with the artificially constructed human FGFR1-IIIb (16.Werner S. Duan D.-S. deVries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), human FGFR1-IIIc (35.Johnson D.E. Lee P.L. Lu J. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4728-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and human FGFR2-IIIb (36.Dell K.R. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21225-21229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, L6 myoblasts stably transfected with cDNAs encoding the different receptor isoforms were incubated with 125I-labeled FGF-1 alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of competitor ligands (FGF-1, -2, -7, and -10). As shown in Fig. 5, FGF-1 and -2 competed well for the binding of 125I-FGF-1 to FGFR1-IIIc, whereas FGF-7 and -10 (37.Beer H.-D. Florenc"
https://openalex.org/W1600652270,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is commonly associated with normal aging and Alzheimer's disease and it is also the principal feature of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type, a familial condition associated to a point mutation G to C at codon 693 of the amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein gene resulting in a Glu to Gln substitution at position 22 of the Abeta (E22Q). The patients carrying the AbetaE22Q variant usually present with lobar cerebral hemorrhages before 50 years of age. A different mutation described in several members of three Italian kindred who presented with recurrent hemorrhagic strokes late in life, between 60 and 70 years of age, also associated with extensive cerebrovascular amyloid deposition has been found at the same position 22, this time resulting in a Glu to Lys substitution (E22K). We have compared the secondary structure, aggregation, and fibrillization properties of the two Abeta40 variants and the wild type peptide. Using flow cytometry analysis after staining with propidium iodide and annexin V, we also evaluated the cytotoxic effects of the peptides on human cerebral endothelial cells in culture. Under the conditions tested, the E22Q peptide exhibited the highest content of beta-sheet conformation and the fastest aggregation/fibrillization properties. The Dutch variant also induced apoptosis of cerebral endothelial cells at a concentration of 25 micrometer, whereas the wild type Abeta and the E22K mutant had no effect. The data suggest that different amino acids at position 22 confer distinct structural properties to the peptides that appear to influence the onset and aggressiveness of the disease rather than the phenotype."

Although calnexin is a lumenally oriented type I membrane protein (4Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas Y.D. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), calreticulin is a soluble lumenal protein (5Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The most striking and conserved region between them is located in the center of these molecules, the proline rich P-domain, which consists of motifs repeated four and three times each in tandem in calnexin and calreticulin respectively (6Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Glycans bind to the P-domain. Binding is exquisitely specific for the monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides which appear as transient intermediates, consequent to the sequential action of glucosidase I and II that remove two glucose residues from Glc3Man5–9GlcNAc2 fromN-linked glycoproteins in the ER (7Hubbard S.C.

Display of monoglucosylated (GlcMan5–9GlcNAc2) structure allows recognition of newly translocated glycoproteins in ER by calreticulin and calnexin, which is essential for their proper folding, assembly, and exit out of ER (6Vassilakos A.

Both calreticulin and calnexin, like other chaperones, interact transiently with the newly synthesized glycoproteins and crucially assist in their folding process (12Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y.

However, they differ strikingly from other chaperones as the cycles of binding and release of substrates to them are regulated by enzymes of contrasting catalytic activities, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) and glucosidase II, respectively, that bring about addition and release, respectively, of glucose on target glycoproteins. UGGT transfers glucose on the non-reducing end mannose of α1–3 arm of Man5–9GlcNAc2 chains of unfolded glycoproteins, only thereby acting as a folding sensor (17Sousa M.C. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,18Parodi A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 287-295Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Once folded or assembled glycoproteins escape calnexin/calreticulin as they are refractory to reglucosylation by UGGT and are ready to leave ER.Although lectin-like activities of calnexin and calreticulin are indispensable for their chaperone function, additional interactions with the polypeptide segments of the substrate have also been proposed. Thus, two extreme views about their chaperone function invoke lectin only (19Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Tombetta E.S. Helenius A.

As the elementary steps for the binding of a macromolecule to its ligand and the activation parameters involved therein shed valuable insights on the mechanism of the reaction, we report here the study of the recognition of the monoglycosylated chicken IgG and the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide, Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 with calreticulin by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). These studies show that the reactions are several orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion controlled processes largely due to a considerable enthalpic barrier for calreticulin-monoglucosyl glycoprotein/glycan (Glc1Man9GlcNAc2) interactions.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe majority of proteins that are translocated in the ER in eukaryotic cells are N-glycosylated. N-Linked glycosylation is a highly conserved process in eukaryotic evolution. With the pioneering work of Helenius and co-workers (3Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), it has become quite clear now that glycosylation allows newly synthesized glycoproteins to interact with a lectin based chaperone system comprising of the ER resident proteins, calnexin and calreticulin, toward promoting their correct folding and oligomerization. The Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 glycan intermediate formed after cleavage of two glucose residues by α-glucosidase I and II from the precursor N-glycan Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 mediates interaction of the glycoproteins with these chaperones. The binding to Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 is highly specific in recognizing the terminal glucose and Glc1Man5 as the minimal structure. In this work, chicken IgG was selected as the target glycoprotein as it exhibits high proportions of monoglucosylated N-linked glycan (Glc1Man9GlcNAc2) (34Ohta H. Hamako J. Yamamoto S. Hatta H. Kim M. Yamamoto T. Oka S. Mizuochi T. Matsuura F. Glycoconjugate J. 1991; 8: 400-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,35Raju T.S. Briggs J.B. Borge S.M. Jones A.J.S. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).When chicken IgG was complexed with greater than 2 m excess of calreticulin and subjected to gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, the sample eluted in four peaks (I–IV) with M r of 280,000 (± 18,000); 235,000 (± 14,000); 180,000 (± 10,000), and 45,000 (± 6000) respectively (Fig.1 a). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass of 46,503 for bovine liver calreticulin (Fig. 1 a, inset). Also, molecular masses of chicken IgG and bovine liver calreticulin were determined as 180,000 and 46,000, respectively, in a separate set of gel filtration experiment using the above Sephacryl S-300 column. This suggested that peak 1 contains 1:2 complex of IgG and calreticulin, and peak 2 contains equimolar amounts of these proteins, while peak 3 and peak 4 contain only free IgG and calreticulin, respectively. Consistent with the above, SDS-PAGE clearly shows that nearly twice as much calreticulin is present in peak 1 as compared with peak 2, whereas peak 3 and 4 showed only IgG and calreticulin respectively (Fig. 1 b). Peaks 1 and 2 were incubated in 50 mm acetic acid for 5 min and subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated with 50 mm acetic acid to obtain [monoglucosyl]1 and [monoglucosyl]2 IgG molecules free of calreticulin for SPR studies. These populations of IgG molecules apparently correspond to contain two and one monoglucosylated oligosaccharide chains and indeed monosaccharide analysis showed them to contain glucose, mannose, and glucosamine in the ratio of 1.8, 17.1, and 3.9 and 0.96, 9.3, and 1.9, respectively. Additionally, the normal phase HPAEC analysis for the oligosaccharide anthranilic acid derivative from peak 1 showed only a peak corresponding to Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 (retention time: 29.4 min) peak. The oligosaccharide fraction from peak 2 showed 45% Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, 40% Man9GlcNAc2 (28.0 min), 8% Man8GlcNAc2 (26.1 min), and traces of Man7GlcNAc2 (24.7 min). Soyabean agglutinin showed greater than 90% Man9GlcNAc2.SPR is a rapid and sensitive method for evaluating the affinities and the elementary steps involved in bimolecular interactions (36Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 37Chaiken I. Rose S. Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38O'Shannesy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Anal.

Biochem. 1996; 233: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As the method relies exclusively on mass changes, the reactions can be studied in real time without taking recourse to external labels such as fluorophores or radioisotopes, which, in some cases, can alter the nature of the reaction. Moreover, SPR is perhaps the only technique that can provide information for both the association and dissociation phases of a reaction in a single experimental run. Ability to precisely control the temperature permits one to evaluate the activation parameters of the reaction.A representative sensogram for the interaction of varying amounts of [monoglucosyl]2 IgG immobilized on a CM-5 chip is depicted in Fig. 2 a. A rapid enhancement and diminution in RUs when calreticulin is followed by buffer containing [monoglucosyl]2 IgG is flown over the immobilized IgG suggests that the accompanying changes in the mass correspond, respectively to the association and dissociation phases of the reaction. Mass transport limited analyses of the sensogram yields the k 1 and k −1 of 3.9 × 104m−1s−1 and 0.08 s−1, respectively, at 25 °C (Table I). A satisfactory distribution of residuals for both the phases of reaction confirms further the monoexponential nature of the reaction (data not shown). The ratio ofk 1/k −1 yields a value of 4.87 × 105m−1for K a at 25 °C. Calreticulin does not exhibit any binding to quail ovalbumin, which predominantly contains Man8GlcNAc2,Man7GlcNAc2, and Man5GlcNAc2 (Fig. 2 a). Additionally, the non-glucosylated IgG counterpart (Man9GlcNAc2) does not bind to calreticulin even at high concentrations (data not shown). Similar values of rate constants were obtained when [monoglucosyl]1 IgG,i.e. IgG molecules containing a single monoglucosyl oligosaccharide chain, was immobilized and calreticulin was flown over it. This suggests that the density of the oligosaccharide chains in the substrate does not alter the kinetic parameters of the interaction (Fig. 2 b and Table I). The association constants for these interactions were also evaluated by Scatchard analysis of the above SPR data. The similarities ofK a obtained by Scatchard analysis and those determined by the ratio ofk 1/k −1 is noted (TableI). Moreover, the interaction between calreticulin and [monoglycosyl]2 IgG were inhibited completely by the free oligosaccharide which not only attest to the specificity of these interactions but also provide an estimate of K a for the latter (Fig. 3 b). Additionally, the binding to [monoglucosyl]2 IgG was totally abrogated in presence of chelator, EGTA, thereby showing the requirement of Ca2+ ions in the chaperone-substrate interaction (data not shown). In a previous study on calreticulin interaction with glycosylated laminin of undefined overall carbohydrate chain composition, a binding constant of 2.1 × 106m−1 and an association rate constant of 2 × 105m−1 s−1were determined indirectly with an assumed value ofk −1 (40McDonnel J.M. Jones G.E. White T.K. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7891-7894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar values of kinetic constants are obtained when calreticulin is immobilized and [monoglucosyl]1 IgG is flown over it (Fig.5 a); thus, the nature of the reaction is unaffected by immobilization of either of the reactants. Studies on interaction between oligosaccharide and plant lectins and C-type animal lectins by SPR showed that the binding affinity values were in good agreement with those previously determined by affinity chromatography and Scatchard analysis (41Yamanoto K. Ishida C. Shiohara Y. Hasegawa Y. Konami Y. Osawa T. Irimura T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8159-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42Shinohara Y. Kim F. Shimizu M. Goto M. Tosu M. Hasegawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rate constants for the association ofRicinus communis agglutinin as determined by temperature jump spectroscopy and the SPR method are also found in perfect agreement (42Shinohara Y. Kim F. Shimizu M. Goto M. Tosu M. Hasegawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Podder S.K. Surolia A. Bacchawat B.K. FEBS Lett. 1978; 85: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Likewise, good agreement has been observed between the SPR data and the isothermal titration calorimetry data for other systems (44Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Moulot G. Greene M.I. Tell D. Dall'Acqua W. Souchon H. Schwarz F.P. Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 45Thomas C.J. Surolia A.

Similarity of binding parameters for the free oligosaccharide, intact IgG molecule, and its heavy chain underscore the lectin-only mode of interaction between calreticulin and its substrates.Figure 2a, overlay plot of sensograms depicting the interaction of calreticulin to the immobilized [monoglucosyl]2 IgG at 25 °C.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The assay is analogous to the system wherein antigen adsorbed onto the polystyrene plates are used to capture the antibody. Binding of calreticulin to the ELISA plate wells was followed by binding chicken IgG. Subsequently, secondary antibody to chicken IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used to monitor the amount of chicken IgG-[monoglucosyl]1or2 captured by calreticulin as per the scheme depicted in Fig.4 a. Conditions for calreticulin concentration, blocking reagent, buffer, time, and secondary antibody dilution were optimized. These parameters of the assay with respect to calreticulin concentration, IgG concentration, and inhibition of this interaction by the oligosaccharide, Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, binding at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 4 (b, c, andd, respectively). When 125 ng of calreticulin was coated on the plates, maximum binding of IgG was observed at 4 μmshowing a sigmoidal binding curve. The K a of the association from this curve is derived to be 4.9 × 106m−1. The binding of oligosaccharide to calreticulin was also studied by the ELISA method. By using various concentrations of the oligosaccharide, IgG binding could be inhibited at 50% of the maximum at 1.45 μm of the oligosaccharide Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, thereby indicating the affinity of the interaction to be 6.9 × 105m−1. The K avalues thus determined are in the range obtained with the SPR method. In another study, similar inhibitory concentrations for the Glcα1–3Manα-2Manα1–2Man fragment of the oligosaccharide as well as for the entire oligosaccharide chain were noted when incubated with labeled [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc2for binding to glutathione S-transferase-CRT immobilized on agarose (6Vassilakos A.

Consequently, it is not surprising to find similar k 1,k −1, and K a values for the binding of calreticulin to [monoglucosyl]1 IgG, [monoglucosyl]2 IgG as well as the free oligosaccharide, Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. This is perhaps a key feature, which distinguishes it from lectins, which both by design and by definition are multivalent (51Goldstein I.J. Hughes R.C. Monsigney M. Osawa T. Sharon N. Nature. 1980; 285: 66Crossref Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In the latter, multivalency increases not only their binding affinities but also their specificities and physiological responses such as cell agglutination, mitogenicity, etc. (51Goldstein I.J.

A wealth of information on the affinities of plant lectin-saccharide/glycopeptide interaction is available, which in turn has been exploited for the isolation and the structural characterization of the latter by affinity chromatography (55Kornfeld R.

These studies have clearly shown that glycans with affinities lower than 106m−1 are merely retarded on lectin columns. Our studies thus provide a rationale for the mere retardation of glucosylated oligosaccharide chains (Glc1Man5–9GlcNAc2) on calreticulin-Sepharose column as being due to its moderate affinity (∼105m−1) for its substrate (11Spiro R.G.

Nonetheless, this moderate affinity appears to be a favorable property for its chaperone function as it would allow multiple rounds of association and dissociation with the unfolded/misfolded glycoprotein substrate. The values ofk 1 and k −1 obtained for calreticulin-substrate interactions are in the range of those obtained for HSP 47-collagen and GroEL-substrate interactions (58Natsume T. Koide T"

Its function is to mediate electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin toS-adenosylmethionine, required for the introduction of a glycyl radical in the large component, named protein α, which then becomes active for the reduction of ribonucleotides. By site-directed mutagenesis we demonstrate that the three cysteines of the conserved CXXXCXXC sequence are involved in iron chelation. Such a sequence is also present in the activase of the pyruvate formate-lyase and in the biotin synthase, both carrying an iron-sulfur center involved in reductive activation ofS-adenosylmethionine. Even though they are able to bind iron in the (4Fe-4S) form, as shown by Mössbauer spectroscopy, the corresponding Cys to Ala mutants are catalytically inactive. Mutation of the two other cysteines of the protein did not result in inactivation. We thus conclude that the (4Fe-4S) cluster has, in the wild type protein, only three cysteine ligands and a fourth still unidentified ligand.

Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The enzymatic system catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleoside triphosphates into the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides by formate (2.Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Ferreira G.C. Moura J.J.G. Iron Metabolism. John Wiley and Sons, Weinheim1999: 161-176Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It consists of several proteins and low molecular weight components. The reductase, named protein α, in the form of a dimer α2, contains the active site where substrates and formate react and allosteric effectors bind. However, as isolated it is not active. We have shown that it is activated during anaerobic incubation with a reducing system (NADPH + flavodoxin reductase + flavodoxin, which can in vitro be replaced by dithionite or photoreduced deazaflavin), dithiothreitol (DTT),1 S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and a specific activating component, named protein β, which functions catalytically with regard to activation of protein α (3.Eliasson R.

It is remarkable that the only modification of protein α, during the process that makes it catalytically competent, is the introduction of an air-sensitive glycyl radical at position 681 (7.Sun X.

Protein β is an iron-sulfur protein, also sensitive to oxygen. Under strict anaerobic and reductive conditions it can assemble a (4Fe-4S) center, which can enjoy both (4Fe-4S)2+ and (4Fe-4S)+ redox states (6.Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A.

Protein β is essential during anaerobic activation of protein α because it catalyzes the one-electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin to AdoMet required for the formation of the glycyl radical. As a matter of fact it has been shown that the reduced (4Fe-4S)+ cluster is able to reduce AdoMet, and it is postulated that this reaction results in the homolytic cleavage of its S-C(5′-deoxyadenosyl) bond and formation of a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, responsible for H atom abstraction at the specific glycine residue (9.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C. Bergman T. Gräslund A. Reichard P. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24216-24223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Under exposure to air, protein β stabilizes (2Fe-2S)2+centers instead, which under anaerobic and reductive conditions are transformed back into active (4Fe-4S) centers (10.Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6344-6350Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The combination of an iron-sulfur center and AdoMet for generating free radicals appears to be a general strategy in biological systems. It is now quite well established that such a chemistry is indeed utilized also in the pyruvate formate-lyase system and in the biotin synthase (11.Külzer R. Pils T. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4897-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12.Guianvarc'h D. Florentin D. Tse Sum Bui B. Nunzi F. Marquet A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Even though there is no amino acid sequence homology between these systems it has been suggested that the cysteines of the CXXXCXXC motif common to biotin synthase and the activating components of pyruvate formate-lyase and ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 1 A) provide a specific metal binding site in each of these enzymes (11.Külzer R. Pils T. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4897-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The Fe-S enzyme lipoate synthase also contains this motif but has not been shown yet to require AdoMet for activity (13.Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The lysine aminomutase belongs to this class of enzymes but is not included in Fig. 1 because its amino acid sequence is unknown (15.Moss M.L. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18112-18115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the limited knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the iron-dependent activation of AdoMet and the importance of such a chemistry in the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase system, we found it crucial to investigate further the structural and reactivity properties of the iron-sulfur center of protein β. In this work we changed the five cysteines of protein β into alanines in order to identify the ligands for the iron center. We actually demonstrate that only the three cysteines Cys-26, Cys-30, and Cys-33 of the CXXXCXXC motif conserved in all known ribonucleotide reductase sequences, a few of which are displayed in Fig. 1 B, are important for activity. Enzymes and other components of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase system have been obtained as described previously (6.Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 57Fe2O3 was converted into its chloride form by dissolving it in a hot concentrated (35%) hydrochloric acid of analytical grade (Carlo Erba) and repetitively concentrated in water. Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 was from Aldrich. AdoMet was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 5-Deaza-7,8-demethyl-10-methylisoalloxazine (DAF) was available in our laboratory. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as a host for the overexpression of protein β (wild type or mutants). E. coli DH5α was used for routine plasmid manipulations. Plasmid pN9, the pET-3b derivative that contains thenrdG gene (5.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Anderson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis of pN9 was performed using a polymerase chain reaction overlap extension procedure with oligonucleotides synthesized by Eurogentec and listed in Table I (16.Ho S.N.

Polymerase chain reaction final reaction products, identified and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, were purified using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit from Qiagen, digested with SphI and BamHI, and subcloned into SphI/BamHI-digested pN9. The entire nrdG gene was sequenced. Besides the desired mutations, we found two silent mutations in all mutated genes, one at position +21 (TAC instead of TAT) and the second at position +27 (GTT instead of GTC).Table IGeneration of mutated genesMutationaMutations are noted with the one-letter code for amino acids.

Wild type and mutated β proteins were overproduced and purified as described previously (6.Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

In method A, the protein (10 mg/ml) was incubated at 4 °C under anaerobic conditions within tubes connected to a manifold under a constant flux of moist N2with a 6-fold molar excess of Na2S and either Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 or57FeCl3 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in the presence of 5 mm DTT. After 2 h, EDTA (2 mm final concentration) was added, and the reaction was stopped after 30 min. After chromatography through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with a DTT-free deaerated buffer, the colored fractions were collected under air and concentrated over a YM-10 Diaflo membrane (Amicon). In the second procedure (method B) all steps of the reconstitution procedure were made anaerobically at 18 °C inside a glove box (Jacomex BS531 NMT) in a N2 atmosphere containing less than 2 ppm O2. As reported previously, methods A and B are used to generate preparations with one (2Fe-2S) and one (4Fe-4S) cluster per polypeptide chain, respectively. For Mössbauer experiments samples were prepared with method B, and the final concentration was 0.5–0.7 mm. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (17.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Protein-bound iron was determined colorimetrically with bathophenantroline after acid denaturation of protein (18.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Sulfide content was determined using the Beinert method (19.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Reduction of reconstituted wild type and mutated β proteins was performed inside the anaerobic glove box. DAF was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, diluted with water to 0.5 mm, and stored inside the box in the dark. Protein (100 μm) was prepared in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and irradiated in the presence of 20–50 μm DAF for 60 min. Reduction could be monitored by light absorption directly inside the box. To avoid exposure to oxygen, EPR tubes were frozen directly inside the box in a well filled with isopentane cooled from outside the box by liquid nitrogen. Activity assays were performed under anaerobic conditions as described previously. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the formation of 1 nmol of dCTP/min (3.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Fontecave M.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 1 mg of protein α was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a stoichiometric amount of the different β mutants in the presence of 2 mm DTT. These preparations were applied to a 4-ml dATP-Sepharose column equilibrated with 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, containing 50 mm KCl and 2 mm DTT. The column was submitted to two consecutive washes. During the first one, with 12 ml of the equilibration buffer, the unbound proteins were eluted. The ribonucleotide reductase complex (containing both α and β proteins) was present in the fractions eluted during the second wash, with the eluting buffer containing 1.5 mm ATP. To determine the amount of protein β bound to protein α, concentrated fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, under denaturing conditions. The amount of protein β was determined by densitometry using a Gel Doc 1000 system and the Molecular Analyst 2.1.2 software from Bio-Rad, after calibration with known amounts of pure preparations of protein β loaded on the same gel. UV-visible spectra of aerobic samples were recorded with a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. Spectra could be also recorded inside the glove box using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer equipped with optical fibers connected to a sample holder inside the box. EPR first derivative spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX (9.5 GHz) EPR spectrometer equipped with an ESR 900 helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). 57Fe-Mössbauer spectra were recorded on 200-μl cups containing the protein (0.5–0.7 mm) with a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer using a 57Co source in a Rh matrix (254 MBq). Measurements at 4.2 and 77 K were performed using a bath cryostat (Oxford Instruments) with an electromagnet mounted outside the cryostat producing a field of 20 mT perpendicular to the γ-ray. High field measurements were performed with a cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet (Oxford Instruments). The spectra were analyzed assuming Lorentzian line shape, the isomer shift is quoted relative to α-Fe at room temperature. The different mutated plasmids were prepared from plasmid pN9, a derivative of pET-3b, using a polymerase chain reaction-based method (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mutated enzymes, in which one of the five cysteines of protein β, Cys-19, Cys-26, Cys-30, Cys-33, and Cys-96, was changed into alanine, were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) under conditions similar to the wild type enzyme. As judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of both whole cells and soluble extracts, the level of expression and the low amount of inclusion bodies for all the mutants were as for the wild type enzyme (data not shown). Inclusion bodies could be minimized if cells were grown at 25 °C after the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The ability of an increasing amount of these extracts to activate a given amount of protein α and thus to complement it during CTP reduction was assayed (Fig. 2). From this experiment it is clear that mutants can be classified in two groups, with C19A and C96A mutant extracts giving high activity, comparable to that of the wild type extract, and C26A, C30A, and C33A mutant extracts giving no activity. All of the mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity, as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, according to the standard procedures developed for the wild type enzyme (8.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, this implies treatment of the soluble extracts by streptomycin sulfate and DNase, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and then filtration on a Superdex 75 column. The elution profiles during chromatography and the purification yields were comparable to the wild type enzyme. In all cases, during filtration the protein appeared as a mixture of monomer and polymeric forms with the monomer being the major species. DTT was added to the buffers to prevent extensive precipitation of the proteins. That the purification led essentially to apoprotein forms, as in the case of the wild type enzyme, was evident from the near absence of chromophore, as shown from the light absorption spectrum of the purified proteins and the very low level of iron and sulfide bound to the protein. Wild type protein β is able to assemble a (2Fe-2S) or a (4Fe-4S) center depending on the reconstitution procedure (6.Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A (2Fe-2S) center is assembled when the protein is incubated with a slight molar excess of iron and sulfide, in the presence of DTT, under anaerobic conditions and desalted on an aerobic Sephadex G-25 column (method A). On the other hand, reconstitution of a (4Fe-4S) center requires strict anaerobiosis, which can be achieved inside an anaerobic box, during both incubation and chromatography (method B). This cluster is sensitive to oxygen and degrades to a (2Fe-2S) center, identical to the one produced by method A. However, this degraded form is enzymatically active because it is converted, under the reductive conditions of the assay, back to the (4Fe-4S) form, which is the active form of the cluster (10.Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6344-6350Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both methods were used for the reconstitution of mutated enzymes. C19A and C96A mutants had iron and sulfide content, spectroscopic properties, and enzyme activities comparable to those of the wild type enzyme, indicating that they were able to bind both (2Fe-2S) or (4Fe-4S) centers as the wild type enzyme (data not shown). We thus concluded that Cys-19 and Cys-96 were not involved in the chelation of the iron center of protein β. Consequently these mutants will not be discussed further. In contrast, the three other mutants showed significant differences from the wild type enzyme. Because their properties were highly comparable and for the sake of clarity, they will be illustrated with only one mutant in the following. For that purpose the C30A mutant was chosen. Single mutations had little effect on the amount of iron and sulfide which the protein could bind during reconstitution by method A, as shown in TableII. The C33A mutant contained about 2 iron and 2 sulfur atoms/chain, as did the wild type enzyme, whereas the two other mutants, C26A and C30A, could bind as much as about 1.5 iron and 1.5 sulfur atoms/polypeptide. That an iron-sulfur center, similar to that of the wild type enzyme, thus in all probability a (2Fe-2S) cluster, was assembled in the mutants was supported further from the remarkable similarity of the light absorption spectra, which all displayed a band at 420 nm and an additional broad absorption at 590 nm (Fig. 3). Furthermore, as shown in Fig.4, despite the mutations, the mutated enzymes had rather stable iron centers because EDTA-dependent release of iron occurred at a rate comparable to that for the wild type enzyme.Table IICharacterization of wild type protein β and mutants reconstituted by method A or B (as described under “Experimental Procedures” and after exposure to airMutantMethod AMethod BMethod B (air exposed)FeaIron and sulfur content are expressed in atoms/β protein (17.5 kDa).SaIron and sulfur content are expressed in atoms/β protein (17.5 kDa).[4Fe-4S]bAmount of [4Fe-4S] S = ½ per β protein in samples reduced by dithionite or deazaflavin determined by EPR spectroscopy.ActivitycMaximal ribonucleotide reductase activity of α protein activated with increasing amounts of each β preparation (wild type and mutants); 100% = 300 units/mg of α.FeaIron and sulfur content are expressed in atoms/β protein (17.5 kDa).SaIron and sulfur content are expressed in atoms/β protein (17.5 kDa).[4Fe-4S]bAmount of [4Fe-4S] S = ½ per β protein in samples reduced by dithionite or deazaflavin determined by EPR spectroscopy.ActivitycMaximal ribonucleotide reductase activity of α protein activated with increasing amounts of each β preparation (wild type and mutants); 100% = 300 units/mg of α.FeaIron and sulfur content are expressed in atoms/β protein (17.5 kDa).SaIron and sulfur content are expressed in atoms/β protein (17.5 kDa).%%Wild type1.92.00.41003.83.60.81001.71.8C26A1.41.30<52.52.50<51.11.0C30A1.51.50<12.92.80<51.71.6C33A2.11.90<13.23.20<11.61.5a Iron and sulfur content are expressed in atoms/β protein (17.5 kDa).b Amount of [4Fe-4S] S = ½ per β protein in samples reduced by dithionite or deazaflavin determined by EPR spectroscopy.c Maximal ribonucleotide reductase activity of α protein activated with increasing amounts of each β preparation (wild type and mutants); 100% = 300 units/mg of α.

Destruction of the cluster was monitored by the decrease of optical density at 420 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When reconstitution of the iron center was achieved by method B, it was observed that the C26A, C30A, and C33A mutants could bind as much as 3 iron and sulfur atoms, whereas the wild type enzyme could bind almost 4 iron and 4 sulfur atoms (Table II). However, in the sample used for Mössbauer spectroscopy, the mutant was found to contain around 4 iron atoms/chain. The iron center of the mutant proteins had much in common with that of the wild type enzyme. First, they all displayed a similar UV-visible spectrum, recorded inside the glove box (Fig. 3). Second, the intensity of the 420 nm band decreased as a consequence of exposure to air (data not shown). The resulting species, after gel filtration, contained less iron (Table I) and displayed a light absorption spectrum similar to that of the proteins reconstituted by method A. It thus seems that deletion of a cysteine does not have a dramatic effect on the iron and sulfide binding capacity of protein β. One of the mutants, C30A, has been reconstituted under strict anaerobiosis (method B) with 57FeCl3. This preparation, containing 4 iron atoms/monomer, was analyzed by Mössbauer spectroscopy at 77 and 4.2 K in an external field of 20 mT perpendicular to the γ-ray and at 4.2 K with an applied field of 7 T parallel to the γ-ray (Fig. 5). The major species in Fig. 5 a (82%) is characterized by a doublet typical for mixed valence delocalized Fe2.5+ sites (parameters δ = 0.47 mm·s−1; ΔEq = 1.06 mm·s−1 and Γ = 0.45 mm·s−1) as in a (4Fe-4S)2+ or (3Fe-4S)0 cluster. The measurements in high field (Fig. 5,c and d) reveal that 54% of the total area belong to a diamagnetic species that is attributed to (4Fe-4S)2+. The remaining 28% of the major doublet in Fig.5 a corresponds to Fe2.5+ sites within a paramagnetic species, which is difficult to interpret. However, the best simulations of the different spectra (Fig. 5) were obtained assuming an S = 2 (3Fe-4S)0 cluster, with spin-Hamiltonian parameters (Table III) different from those found for the wild type protein β (20.Mulliez E.

The Fe3+ sites of this cluster (14%) exhibit a quadrupole doublet with the parameters δ = 0.42 mm·s−1; ΔEq = 0.55 mm·s−1, and Γ = 0.24 mm·s−1. The sample also contains a small amount of high spin ferrous iron (4%) with δ = 1.2 mm·s−1 and ΔEq = 3.4 mm·s−1.

The relatively large line width of the Fe2.5+ doublet in the spectra of Fig. 5, a and b, and the fact that only two cysteines are available for cluster coordination led us to fit the diamagnetic species in the spectra taken at 4.2 K with two distinct subspectra in the ratio 1:1. The resulting values are: δ1 = 0.43 mm·s−1, ΔEq 1 = 1 mm·s−1, Γ1 = 0.38 mm·s−1, and δ2 = 0.5 mm·s−1, ΔEq 2 = 1.18 mm·s−1, Γ2 = 0.38 mm·s−1. The parameters for subspectrum 1 are typical for conventional (4Fe-4S)2+clusters, whereas δ2 is significantly higher, in the range of the highest reported isomer shifts (21.Bertini I. Ciurli S. Luchinat C. Struct. Bond. 1995; 83: 1-53Crossref Google Scholar). This corroborates the idea that two Fe2.5+ sites are not cysteine ligated, and the higher quadrupole splitting reflects a lower symmetry of these sites compared with those with sulfur-only coordination. The spectrum at 77 K was then reanalyzed successfully with the new parameters. The final parameter set of the various iron sites is summarized in Table III. The observation that two different iron sites could be distinguished by Mössbauer spectroscopy in the C30A mutant led us to reanalyze the previously reported Mössbauer data of the wild type enzyme. The wild type (4Fe-4S)2+ center was characterized previously by a single doublet with δ = 0.44 mm·s−1, ΔEq = 1.0 mm·s−1, Γ = 0.38 mm·s−1 (6.Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using two quadrupole doublets with area ratio 1:3 and with the parameters obtained from the mutant slightly improved the fit (Fig. 6) and hence is in agreement with the idea that one Fe2.5+ site is not cysteine-ligated. In conclusion, the Mössbauer data show that a large portion of the iron is still assembled as (4Fe-4S)2+ clusters in the C30A mutant. To our knowledge this"
https://openalex.org/W2047658919,"The functional consequences of peptide-carbohydrate mimicry were analyzed on the basis of the crystal structure of concanavalin A (ConA) in complex with a carbohydrate-mimicking peptide, DVFYPYPYASGS. The peptide binds to the non-crystallographically related monomers of two independent dimers of ConA in two different modes, in slightly different conformations, demonstrating structural adaptability in ConA-peptide recognition. In one mode, the peptide has maximum interactions with ConA, and in the other, it shows relatively fewer contacts within this site but significant contacts with the symmetry-related subunit. Neither of the peptide binding sites overlaps with the structurally characterized mannose and trimannose binding sites on ConA. Despite this, the functional mimicry between the peptide and carbohydrate ligands was evident. The peptide-inhibited ConA induced T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of the designed analogs of the peptide on ConA-induced T cell proliferation and their recognition by the antibody response against α-d-mannopyranoside indicate a role for aromatic residues in functional mimicry. Although the functional mimicry was observed between the peptide and carbohydrate moieties, the crystal structure of the ConA-peptide complex revealed that the two peptide binding sites are independent of the methyl α-d-mannopyranoside binding site.

Since specificity of recognition is defined by the structural properties common to all molecular processes, it is possible to encounter systemic dysfunction due to unrelated molecules sharing common structural features. Autoimmune diseases are a manifestation of such an aberration of normal function. Since many microbial agents share common determinants with host proteins, the immune response mounted by the host against a specific determinant of a microbial agent may cross-react with the mimicking host determinant, leading to autoimmunity (1.Appelmelk B.J. Negrini R. Moran A.P. Kuipers E.J.

On the other hand, functional mimicry also occurs by design as an effective control in several regulatory mechanisms that include transcription and cellular signaling (3.Chavali G.B. Nagpal S. Majumdar S.S. Singh O. Salunke D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4.Grewal N. Nagpal S. Chavali G.B. Majumdar S.S. Pal R. Salunke D.M Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1190-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Molecular mimicry has implications in rational drug design as well. Design and development of nonpeptidyl drugs, mimicking therapeutically important bioactive peptides and proteins, provide increased selectivity, improved bioavailability, and prolonged activity (5.Beeley N. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6.Tian S.S. Lamb P. King A. Miller S. Kessler L. Luengo J.I. Averill L. Johnson R.K. Gleason G.J. Pelus L.M. Dillon S.B. Rosen J. Science. 1998; 281: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the structural principles governing molecular mimicry could be important in its successful exploitation. In an attempt to systematically delineate the structural relationship between two chemically dissimilar but functionally equivalent molecular structures, we had earlier compared the antibody responses and the topological features of a peptide and a carbohydrate moiety, which recognize a common receptor, ConA1 (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ConA is a lectin specific for binding to mannose-containing carbohydrates on the cell surface (8.Elgavish S. Shaanan B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is also a lymphocyte mitogen and a useful reagent for differentiating normal from malignant cells (9.Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 10.Inbar M. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Peptide ligands of ConA were identified by screening a large and diverse peptide library expressed on the surface of a filamentous phage (11.Oldenberg K.R. Loganathan D. Goldstein I.J. Schultz P.G. Gallop M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5393-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 12.Scott J.K. Loganathan D. Easly R.B. Gong X. Goldstein I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The peptide, DVFYPYPYASGS (12-mer), was shown to bind to ConA with an affinity comparable with that of the methyl α-d-mannopyranoside (11.Oldenberg K.R. Loganathan D. Goldstein I.J. Schultz P.G. Gallop M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5393-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We have earlier shown that the murine pAbs raised against this peptide bind to α-d-mannopyranoside, and similarly, the pAbs raised against the sugar react with 12-mer (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was apparent that the ConA binding activities of various analogs correlate well with the topological relationship between the peptide and the carbohydrate ligands. Here we report the crystal structure of a carbohydrate-mimicking peptide bound to ConA and analyze its functional implications. The peptides were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer, as described earlier (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using solid phase 9-fluorenylmethyl oxycarbonyl chemistry. The crude peptides were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Waters) using water, acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as eluant. The peptides were characterized for their purity by molecular mass determination using a single quadruple mass analyzer (Fisons Instruments). ConA (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.32 mm was co-crystallized with a 20-fold excess of peptide using the vapor diffusion method with 1 mammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.0). The x-ray intensity data were collected on an image plate detector (Marresearch, Germany) installed on a rotating anode x-ray source (Rigaku, Japan) operated at 40 kV and 70 mA (CuKα radiation). The crystal-to-detector distance was 235 mm, and 0.25° oscillation frames were recorded. The diffraction data were collected from two different crystals, processed separately using the DENZO (13.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Issacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar) suite of programs, and subsequently merged using SCALEPACK. The data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table I. The crystallization of ConA in complex with methyl α-d-mannopyranoside was reported in this space group earlier, although atomic resolution structural analysis was not carried out due to disorder in the crystals (14.Hardman K.D.

The initial model was subjected to rigid body refinement in X-PLOR (18.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar), first treating dimer as a rigid body and then each monomer independently. This was followed by several cycles of positional refinement. Higher resolution data, up to 2.75 Å, were added in a stepwise fashion. Both conventional R-factor (R cryst) and the free R-value (R free) were used to monitor the progress of refinement. The electron density maps were calculated using the CCP4 package (19.SERC Daresbury Laboratory CCP4: A Suite of Programs for Protein Crystallography. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1979Google Scholar) and were displayed with the help of O (20.Jones T.A. Cowan S. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) on INDIGO2 (Silicon Graphics Inc.). Iterative rebuilding of the models was based on 2F o − F cas well as F o − F c maps alternatively. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints with a weight of 120 kCal mol−1Å−2 were used throughout the refinement. Water molecules were included in the model using 3ς in F o − F c and 1ς in 2F o − F c electron density cut-off if they made reasonable hydrogen bonding contacts. Splenic cells (0.5 × 106/well) from unimmunized BALB/c mice were cultured (at 37 °C and 5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 medium, in a 96-well flat-bottom plate (Nunclon, Nunc, Denmark) for 48 h in the presence of ConA (4 μg/ml; 50 μl). The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries) and 40 μg/ml gentamicin. Various concentrations of the 12-mer peptide were added to this culture in order to analyze the dose-dependent effect of the peptide. At the end of 48 h, the cells were pulsed with methyl [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 0.5 μCi/well; 25 μl) for 12 h and then harvested onto a filter pad (Betaplate; Wallac), and the radioactivity counts were recorded (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A control experiment, wherein different concentrations of the peptide were added to the splinic cell culture in the absence of ConA, was also carried out. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and results are presented as counts/min as a function of peptide concentration. Thep-aminophenyl α-d-mannopyranoside (Sigma) and 12-mer were conjugated to bovine serum albumin/diptheria toxoid using the glutaraldehyde method, as described previously (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The sugar-bovine serum albumin conjugate was used for raising the polyclonal antisera in female BALB/c mice. Antibody binding was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 12-mer-diptheria toxoid was adsorbed on 96-well Maxisorp Nunc plates at a concentration of 2 μg/well in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. Wells with adsorbed antigens were blocked with 1% gelatin in PBS before adding serial dilutions of anti-sugar pAbs. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used as the secondary antibody. The peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine was added finally to detect binding of the pAb. For the competitive assay, constant amounts of anti-sugar pAbs were incubated with equal volumes of increasing concentrations of peptides. The level of inhibition was calculated by comparison of the absorbance (at 490 nm) from the wells reacted with the antibody in the presence of the soluble competitor and those reacted with the antibody in the absence of the competitor. The asymmetric unit of ConA-peptide complex crystals contains two dimers with each monomer comprising of 237 residues of ConA, two metal ions, Mn2+ and Ca2+, and one 12-mer peptide. The two dimers, defined by monomers A and B and monomers C and D respectively, are positioned such that the ConA tetramers ABA′B′ and CDC′D′ are generated by the two independent crystallographic 2-fold axes. A′B′ is a dimer related to AB by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, and C′D′ is a dimer related to CD by another independent crystallographic 2-fold axis. The structures of the two independent dimers AB and CD are almost exactly identical. However, the two subunits within each of the dimers, namely A and B (or C and D), have certain regions significantly different from each other. Particularly, the loop incorporating residues 200–206 has different conformation in the two subunits. In addition, residues 116–123, which comprise a loop between the adjacent β-strands, are poorly defined in the electron density map of both the subunits. The root mean square deviation between the two subunits for all of the backbone atoms is 0.36 Å, and that for the loop 200–206 is 2.5 Å. All of the residues of the peptide molecule could be traced in the electron density map. A representative F o −F c map of the 12-mer peptide bound to ConA is shown in Fig. 1. The peptide binds to ConA in two different modes. The overall conformation is somewhat similar in these modes with differences primarily in the side chain orientations. Superimposition of the two conformations gives a root mean square deviation of 2.27 Å for the C-α trace, although their conformational energies are comparable. The main chain conformation of the peptide in both of the modes is extended with a hairpin formed by residues Tyr6, Pro7, and Tyr8, resulting in the amino and the carboxyl termini coming in close proximity. All of the four peptide molecules associated with the four subunits of ConA were found to be within the energetically favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. A hydrogen bond stabilizing the loop conformation is found in the peptide bound to the A (and D) subunit between the terminal carboxyl group of the peptide and the Tyr4-OH. In the P1 mode, the peptide interacts with subunit A (and D) in a shallow crevice, and it is largely exposed to the solvent from one side (Fig. 2 A). The peptide shows extensive interactions with ConA and binds to residues Tyr22, Pro23, Lys39–Asn44, Lys46, Lys200, Ser201, and Ser204–Pro206. We shall refer to this as the primary peptide binding site. In this mode, the only contacts of the 12-mer peptide with the symmetry-related molecule are through Pro5 and Tyr6. Distinct hydrogen bonds observed between the peptide and ConA are listed in TableII. On the other hand, in P2 mode, the peptide is sandwiched between two crystallographically related ConA subunits. Here, the peptide binds to subunit B (and C) in a site roughly corresponding to the primary binding site of the subunit A (Fig. 2 B). The residues of ConA in contact with the peptide in this mode are Thr11, Pro23, Met42–Lys46, Lys200, Ser201, and Pro206. The peptide in P2 mode exhibits significant contacts with the crystallographic equivalent of subunit A, defining the secondary peptide binding site in that subunit. The protein residues involved in defining this site are Thr11–Pro13, Thr15, Ser21–Pro23, Lys39, His205, and Pro206. Thus, the P2 binding mode and the peptide conformation appear to be influenced by the symmetry contacts. There are five hydrogen bonds between the peptide and the protein, out of which two are with the symmetry-related subunit (TableII).Table IIHydrogen bonding between peptide and ConAPeptideConADistanceÅP1 conformation Asp1OD2Lys200 NZ2.8 Val2 OLys46 NZ3.3 Tyr6NSer204 O3.4 Tyr8 OHPro23N3.4 Ser12 OGln43 NE23.3 Pro5 O(Lys39) NZ2.6 Tyr6OH(Asn41) OD13.0P2 conformation Val2OLys200 NZ3.1 Phe3 OLys46N3.1 Pro5 NAsn44 O3.3 Tyr8 OH(Pro206) N3.2 Tyr8OH(Pro206) O2.6Residues in parentheses correspond to the symmetry-related molecule.

While exploring the structural basis of peptide-carbohydrate mimicry, it is pertinent to address its implications vis-à-vis the biological function. ConA is a known mitogenic stimulant of T lymphocytes (9.Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). The binding of ConA to the T cell surface glycoproteins through carbohydrate moieties is implicated in this function. It was observed that the normal proliferative effect of ConA is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 12-mer (Fig.3 A). Inhibition of cell proliferation could be observed at a 31 μm concentration of 12-mer, and any further increase in the concentration resulted in a steady decline in proliferation. At a peptide concentration of about 100 μm, 50% inhibition of the ConA-induced T-cell proliferation is achieved, which is comparable with its dissociation constant (K d). Thus, the inhibition of T cell proliferation correlates well with the affinity of the native peptide toward ConA. Also, the control experiment carried out by adding varying concentrations of the 12-mer in the absence of ConA to splenic cells showed no effect on the inhibition. This implies that the interaction of ConA with the cell surface mannose-rich oligosaccharides was indeed blocked by this peptide. T cell proliferation was also analyzed in the presence of various analogs of the 12-mer where Tyr6 of the YPY motif, a consensus sequence among the ConA binding peptides, was replaced by another aromatic residue, Phe (DVFYPFPYASGS) and a nonaromatic polar residue Ser (DVFYPSPYASGS). As seen in Fig.3 A, the inhibition of proliferation is differentially affected by these analogs with Phe-substituted analog showing relatively higher inhibitory effect than the Ser-substituted analog. Substitutions at Tyr also affect the carbohydrate mimicking property of the peptide. Analogs of the 10-mer peptide, MYWYPYASGS, which showed better cross-reactivity with the anti-α-d-mannopyranoside pAbs (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in comparison with the 12-mer, were synthesized by substituting Tyr4 with Phe (MYWFPYASGS) and Ser (MYWSPYASGS) and analyzed for their carbohydrate-mimicking activity. Binding activities of the Tyr4-substituted analogs with anti-α-d-mannopyranoside pAbs were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 3 B). Substitution analysis showed that replacement of Tyr4 by Phe had no effect, whereas Ser substitution at the same position decreases its cross-reactivity with anti-α-d-mannopyranoside pAbs. Similar results were also obtained in the case of the analogs where Tyr6 was changed to Phe and Ser, respectively. Functional mimicry involving apparently unrelated molecules may not necessarily imply a structural relationship. Indeed, molecules with no obvious shape similarity have been shown to induce the same signal (6.Tian S.S. Lamb P. King A. Miller S. Kessler L. Luengo J.I. Averill L. Johnson R.K. Gleason G.J. Pelus L.M. Dillon S.B. Rosen J. Science. 1998; 281: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21.Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, in several instances shared surface features at the functional site have been suggested to be critical in eliciting mimicry (22.Ducancel F. Mérienne K. Fromen-Romano C. Trémeau O. Pillet L. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31345-31353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Structural similarities leading to functional mimicry have important consequences in immune recognition. We had earlier shown that the antibody responses against a carbohydrate moiety could distinguish structural features within the carbohydrate-mimicking peptide (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was therefore anticipated that the crystal structure of the ConA·12-mer complex would provide finer details of the structural relationship between the carbohydrate and the peptide ligands. The backbone conformation of the peptide-bound form of ConA closely resembles that of ConA in its native form as well as in the form complexed with various carbohydrate ligands (23.Reeke Jr., G.N. Becker J. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1525-1547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), the only exception being for the loop incorporating residues 200–206. The conformation of this loop in the case of the B subunit is similar to that in native ConA. However, this is not the case for the A subunit. This loop has been reported to be poorly defined in trimannose complex (24.Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) but was well ordered in the peptide-ConA complex. In addition, significant changes in side chain conformations in the binding site occur due to ConA-peptide interaction. It has been observed that the interactions of ConA with different ligands influence crystal packing, since the ligand participates in stabilization of the crystal contacts (24.Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 25.Derewenda Z. Yariv J. Helliwell J.R. Kalb (Gilboa) A.J. Dodson E.J. Papiz M.Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30614-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Molecular packing in the crystals of the ConA-peptide complex is such that the crystallographically characterized mannose/trimannose binding sites are not accessible to the peptide in any of the four subunits. A primary peptide binding site could be defined independent of the sugar binding site in all four subunits. On the other hand, a secondary peptide binding site is generated as a result of molecular packing in only two of the four subunits. The 12-mer peptide interacts with ConA in two different ways. The contacts of the peptide that binds only to the primary binding site are different from those of the peptide that binds both at the primary and the secondary binding sites. An interesting feature of the structure is that the peptide shows conformational adaptability while binding at the primary binding site in the two different modes, although crystal packing facilitates this variation. The secondary peptide binding site, which is generated by the interaction of symmetry-related molecule, may also be of physiological consequence. It is located between the mannose binding site and the primary peptide binding site (Fig.4). The interactions in this case are dominantly hydrophobic, involving aromatic residues in addition to hydrogen bonds. However, the peptide binding sites do not correspond to the hydrophobic sites earlier identified in ConA (27.Hardman K.D. Ainsworth C.F. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4442-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28.Edelman G.M. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3016-3022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are stacking interactions between the aromatic residues of the peptide and the protein. The two different modes of peptide-ConA interaction observed here conform with the multiple ways of oligosaccharide binding to ConA (26.Loris R. Maes D. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Bouckaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30614-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The functional mimicry between the sugar and the peptide that was earlier suggested (7.Kaur K.J.

A. 1992; 89: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) has been further established. It has been known that ConA induces mitogenicity by binding to mannose-rich complex carbohydrates on T lymphocytes (29.Zanetta J.P. Badache A. Maschke S. Marschal P. Kuchler S. Histol. Histopathol. 1994; 9: 385-412PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Ni Y. Tizard I. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 55: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 12-mer inhibits ConA-induced T-cell proliferation, implying that the peptide could share the binding sites of mannose moieties of the complex carbohydrates of cell surface in solution. Moreover, as suggested earlier (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11.Oldenberg K.R.

Goldstein I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the YPY region of the peptide appears to be critical for ConA binding. The substitution of Tyr by Phe in YPY motif shows marginal effect on the inhibition of ConA-induced T cell proliferation; on the other hand, a Ser substitution shows significant loss of inhibition. Also, we had shown that the pAbs raised against α-d-mannopyranoside cross-react with the peptide and that the anti-peptide pAbs cross-react with the sugar (7.Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The effect of designed analogs of the carbohydrate-mimicking peptide on anti-sugar pAb cross-reactivity also implies that the YPY region of the peptide is indeed sensitive to the antibody cross-reactivity. The substitution of Tyr by Phe in the YPY motif shows no effect on cross-reactivity with anti-sugar pAbs. On the other hand, a Ser substitution shows significant loss in the activity. Thus, the aromatic residues contribute to the inhibition of ConA-induced T cell proliferation as well as the carbohydrate mimicry as observed in terms of the immune response. The aromatic nature of residues involved in carbohydrate-peptide mimicry, observed here, is not entirely unprecedented. There are other reports where aromatic amino acids contribute toward the functional mimicry through carbohydrate resemblance (31.Hoess R. Brinkmann U. Handel T. Pastan I. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32.Westerink M.A.J. Giardina P.C. Apicella M.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structure. 1996; 4: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The comparison of peptide and sugar complexes of the lectin does not indicate any overlap between the two ligands. However, the peptide binding sites are in close proximity to the mannose and trimannose binding sites (Fig. 4). Only the recently reported structure of an extended pentasaccharide bound to ConA (34.Moothoo D.N. Naismith J.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) shows some overlap of the terminal sugar of the pentasaccharide with the peptide binding site. The possibility that the peptide also binds at the monosaccharide binding site in solution cannot be completely excluded. However, crystal packing might have prevented this mode of peptide binding. The comparison of the peptide-ConA and sugar-ConA interactions highlights the independent nature of binding sites of the two ligands, although the solution studies imply the existence of the functional mimicry between the carbohydrate and peptide moieties. It was hoped that the crystal structure of ConA bound to peptide would shed light on the structural basis for the peptide carbohydrate mimicry. However, at least for the time being, it remains a mystery. We thank Drs. M. R. N. Murthy and K. V. S. Rao for critically reading the manuscript and Drs. A. Qadri and V.

The mutated proteins are all catalytically competent. Mutations of Arg285 result in an increase (≈300-fold) ofK m for the d-amino acid and in a large decrease (≈500-fold) of turnover number. Stopped-flow analysis shows that the decrease in turnover is paralleled by a similar decrease in the rate of flavin reduction (k 2), the latter still being the rate-limiting step of the reaction. In agreement with data from the protein crystal structure, loss of the guanidinium group of Arg285 in the mutated DAAOs drastically reduces the binding of several carboxylic acids (e.g. benzoate). These results highlight the importance of this active site residue in the precise substrate orientation, a main factor in this redox reaction. Furthermore, Arg285 DAAO mutants have spectral properties similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, but show a low degree of stabilization of the flavin semiquinone and a change in the redox properties of the free enzyme. From this, we can unexpectedly conclude that Arg285 in the free enzyme form is involved in the stabilization of the negative charge on the N(1)-C(2)=O locus of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin.

New interesting findings (as a role of the enzyme in modulation d-serine level in brain) shed light on the debated role of DAAO in mammalian organisms (1Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc.

Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar) has not yet been solved, even if recently two groups have reported the crystal structure of the enzyme purified from pig kidney (pkDAAO) at a resolution of 2.6 and 3.0 Å, respectively (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Over the years, three main different mechanisms have been proposed for the reaction catalyzed by this flavoenzyme (see Mattevi et al. (6Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for a recent review). (i) The hypothesis that the reductive half-reaction of DAAO involves the initial formation of a carbanion by abstraction of the α-H of the substrate as a proton comes from the elimination of halide from β-chloro-d-alanine (7Walsh C.T. Schonbrunn A. Abeles R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6855-6866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The observation of a transfer of α-hydrogen of the substrate to the C(5) position of the enzyme reconstituted with 5-deaza-FAD provides evidence in favor of a direct hydride-transfer mechanism (8Hersh L.B. Jorns M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8728-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) Finally a concerted mechanism (consistent with the experimental evidence for a carbanion mechanism) in which α-H+ abstraction is coupled with the transfer of a hydride from the amino group of the substrate has been put forward (9Miura R. Miyake Y. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 97-110Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar).As a model for DAAO to have a better understanding of this crucial issue, we have used the enzyme from the red yeast Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO). Actually, RgDAAO possesses peculiar properties, as the high catalytic efficiency and the tight binding with the coenzyme FAD, which distinguish it from the mammalian enzyme (10Pilone Simonetta M. Pollegioni L. Casalin P. Curti B. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Casalin P. Pollegioni L. Curti B. Pilone M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties are most probably related to its physiological role (yeast can metabolize d-amino acids and use them as the sole nitrogen and carbon source) and to an evolutionary drive. From comparison of the primary sequences of the known DAAOs, it is evident that only three residues, among those identified in or near the active site (13Faotto L. Pollegioni L. Ceciliani F. Ronchi S. Pilone M.S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1995; 17: 193-198Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are conserved (namely two tyrosines and one arginine). The presence of an arginine residue located at the active site and directly involved in DAAO catalysis was in fact previously proposed by various chemical modification studies (for a review, see Ref. 3Curti B. Ronchi S. Pilone Simonetta M. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar and references therein). The possibility that the arginine residue could be involved in substrate binding by electrostatic interaction with the substrate was inferred by Nishino et al. (14Nishino T. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3610-3616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from 2,3-butanedione modification of the mammalian enzyme, followed by reaction with dansylchloride. On the other hand, the reactivity with sulfite and the spectral properties of the native and cyclohexandione-modified pkDAAO reconstituted with 8-mercapto-FAD suggested that the active site arginine could act as the positively charged group near the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus and responsible for stabilization of anionic flavin forms (15Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This basic residue has been identified in the primary sequence of RgDAAO, by irreversible inhibition using phenylglyoxal (16Gadda G. Negri A. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17809-17814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the question regarding its role was not solved. More recently, the resolution of the crystal structure of pkDAAO in complex with benzoate and anthranilate (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showed that Arg283interacts with the carboxylate group of the ligand and that the negative charge on the N(1)-C(2)=O locus of the flavin is stabilized by the dipole of α-helix F5. This result was apparently in contrast with the previous reports (see above).The crystal structure of RgDAAO has been recently solved at very high resolution (up to 1.2 Å), as a basis for the interpretation of the mechanistic studies and to find a rationale of its high catalytic efficiency. 2S. Umhau, L. Pollegioni, G. Molla, K. Diederichs, W. Welte, M. S. Pilone, and S. Ghisla, submitted for publication.2S. Umhau, L. Pollegioni, G. Molla, K. Diederichs, W. Welte, M. S. Pilone, and S. Ghisla, submitted for publication. The structure of oxidized enzyme in complex with the quasi-substrate CF3-alanine and of reduced enzyme in complex with the substrate d-alanine, revealed the mode of substrate binding (Fig. 1 A). The α-carboxylic group of the d-amino acid interacts electrostatically with the γ- and ε-amino groups of Arg285 (at ∼2.8 Å) and it is H-bonded with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr223 and Tyr238. The substrate α-amino group is H-bonded symmetrically with the backbone C=O group of Ser335 and the active site water molecule H2O72, while the substrate side chain is oriented toward the hydrophobic binding pocket of the active site (see Fig. 1 A).At the same time, we are substantiating the role of the active site residues of RgDAAO by site-directed mutagenesis of each single residue. In a previous paper we reported the effect of substitution of Tyr223 with a phenylalanine and a serine (18Harris C.M. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36233-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The characterization of the corresponding mutant RgDAAO's allowed us to exclude that Tyr223 can act as an active-site base, and highlighted its importance for the correct orientation of the bound substrate, as required for an efficient catalysis. We report here on the characterization of four single points mutants obtained by substitution of Arg285. The combination of the information derived from the site-directed mutagenesis studies and from the crystal structures confirms the involvement of Arg285 in substrate binding, but put forward a possible role in stabilization of the negative charge on the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus in the free enzyme.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this paper demonstrate that the conserved Arg285 plays different roles at the active site of RgDAAO. We successfully expressed in E. coli four RgDAAO mutants at position Arg285 using the pT7-DAAO expression system (21Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and purified them to homogeneity as holoenzyme with a good yield (≥20%). The mutation of Arg285 results in no gross perturbation or loss of FAD, thus the observed changes are due to only specific and local structural modifications. The main role of this residue in substrate binding has been substantiated by the known three-dimensional structure of mammalian DAAO (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and, recently, from the structure at high resolution of RgDAAO.2 In the latter, the structure of the reduced enzyme-d-alanine complex at 1.2-Å resolution reveals the mode of substrate binding (Fig. 1 A): the carboxylate position of the amino acid is electrostatically bound via a two-point interaction with the γ- and ε-amino group of Arg285 (at a distance of 2.79 Å).2 The large decrease in substrate affinity (and ligand binding) observed with the mutant enzymes is well explained by the involvement of this arginine residue in binding and fixation (Fig.1 A). The ligand-binding experiments demonstrate that the overall substrate binding pocket is largely altered even when a conservative mutation, as in the case of the R285K mutant, is present (Table III).The change in flavin redox potentials of R285K and the thermodynamic instability of the semiquinone form in all mutants profoundly distinguish them from the wild-type DAAO. At the moment, only the three-dimensional structure of RgDAAO and pkDAAO in complex with a substrate or a ligand is available (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).2 In this structure, the isoalloxazine ring is located in a hydrophobic environment making contacts with the side chain of different residues but, differently from pkDAAO and from other flavoproteins (6Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), no basic residue(s) or α-helix dipole is properly located to interact with the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O position.2 A (partial) positive charge in proximity of this flavin locus is required to stabilize several anionic flavin derivatives (e.g. the N(5) covalent adduct with sulfite). Since the ε-amino group of Arg285 in RgDAAO is ∼7 Å far away from the N(1)-C(2)=O flavin position (in the EFlred-d-alanine complex), it cannot stabilize the negative charge on the flavin.2 We suggest that in the free enzyme form (i.e. in the absence of a ligand) the side chain of Arg285 is able to rotate to a distance of ∼3 Å from the N(1)-C(2)=O flavin locus (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the lack of the guanidinium group of Arg285 in the mutants determines the absence of the counterion required for stabilization of flavin semiquinone. This lower stabilization is further supported by the ∼104-fold increase in K d for binding of sulfite (Table III). Moreover, we are tempted to conclude that a similar function is exerted by Arg283 in the mammalian DAAO, and thus to give a rationale of the results obtained from chemical modification studies (15Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ferti C. Curti B. Simonetta M.S. Ronchi S. Galliano M. Minchiotti L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, the inferred interaction of Arg283 with the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus in the free form of pkDAAO could explain the observation that the chemical modification of this residue destroyed the ability of pkDAAO to stabilize the benzoquinoid form of 8-mercapto-FAD and to form an N(5)-adduct with sulfite (15Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The crystal structure of oxidized DAAO in complex withl-lactate and of reduced enzyme complexed withd-alanine shows that the side chain of Arg285is at >5 Å from the α-CH group of the substrate. Thereby, in this position Arg285 is far way from the reactive α-hydrogen and cannot be the active site base required by a carbanion mechanism for substrate dehydrogenation. In fact, all the Arg285mutants we produced possess appreciable dehydrogenase activity (they can be anaerobically reduced by the substrate d-alanine). On the other hand, the large decrease in the rate of flavin reduction (and therefore in turnover) is quite surprising. Thek cat for R285K and R285A are decreased by about 450- and 7000-fold, respectively, in comparison to the wild-type RgDAAO (12Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this change is accompanied by a parallel decrease in the rate of flavin reduction (Table IV). Since k 2 is still rate-limiting, we can rule out a change in the kinetic mechanism. A main kinetic difference with respect to the wild-type DAAO is that, due to the large decrease in k 2,k 3 ≫ k 2 for the Arg285 mutants and thus the reductive half-reaction is essentially monophasic. The effect of Arg285 substitution on RgDAAO catalysis can be explained in terms of the recently proposed mechanism in which “orbital steering/interactions are the predominant or the sole important factors in catalysis.”2 The perturbation of the active site in the Arg285 mutants modifies the precise substrate alignment: alteration of the reaction trajectory results in a large change in the reaction velocity (k red and k cat). A similar large effect has been also reported for the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase, as a consequence of small trajectory changes via substrate modification and metal co-ordination (17Mesecar A.D. Stoddard B.L. Koshland D.E. Science. 1997; 277: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Actually, a second possibility has also to be taken into account, namely that an equilibrium form of the enzyme-substrate complex exists, in which the guanidinium side chain of Arg285 is no longer in contact with the carboxylate but it reaches a position in which it could abstract the proton from the α-carbon of the substrate.The mechanism by which substrate dehydrogenation occurs in DAAO cannot be solved solely on the basis of structural data, thus new investigations are required to rule out definitively the possibility that Arg285 could be the acid/base residue required by a carbanion-type mechanism. Our results support the concept that precise binding and orientation of the substrate is a main quantitative factor in RgDAAO catalysis. Albeit the lack of the free enzyme crystal structure, the novel hypothesis on a conformational swing of the side chain of Arg285 from the position (seen in the structure) in which it binds the carboxylate anion, to a different one (next to the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus) in the free enzyme form, fits with the interpretation of the whole body of data. Moreover, the model we have proposed permits a reconciliation of the apparently contradictory conclusions that arose from the three-dimensional structure and from chemical modification studies of pkDAAO (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I.

(ii) The observation of a transfer of α-hydrogen of the substrate to the C(5) position of the enzyme reconstituted with 5-deaza-FAD provides evidence in favor of a direct hydride-transfer mechanism (8Hersh L.B. Jorns M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8728-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) Finally a concerted mechanism (consistent with the experimental evidence for a carbanion mechanism) in which α-H+ abstraction is coupled with the transfer of a hydride from the amino group of the substrate has been put forward (9Miura R. Miyake Y. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 97-110Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As a model for DAAO to have a better understanding of this crucial issue, we have used the enzyme from the red yeast Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO). Actually, RgDAAO possesses peculiar properties, as the high catalytic efficiency and the tight binding with the coenzyme FAD, which distinguish it from the mammalian enzyme (10Pilone Simonetta M. Pollegioni L. Casalin P. Curti B. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Casalin P. Pollegioni L. Curti B. Pilone M.S. Eur. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties are most probably related to its physiological role (yeast can metabolize d-amino acids and use them as the sole nitrogen and carbon source) and to an evolutionary drive. From comparison of the primary sequences of the known DAAOs, it is evident that only three residues, among those identified in or near the active site (13Faotto L. Pollegioni L. Ceciliani F. Ronchi S. Pilone M.S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1995; 17: 193-198Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are conserved (namely two tyrosines and one arginine). The presence of an arginine residue located at the active site and directly involved in DAAO catalysis was in fact previously proposed by various chemical modification studies (for a review, see Ref. 3Curti B. Ronchi S. Pilone Simonetta M. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar and references therein). The possibility that the arginine residue could be involved in substrate binding by electrostatic interaction with the substrate was inferred by Nishino et al. (14Nishino T. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3610-3616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from 2,3-butanedione modification of the mammalian enzyme, followed by reaction with dansylchloride. On the other hand, the reactivity with sulfite and the spectral properties of the native and cyclohexandione-modified pkDAAO reconstituted with 8-mercapto-FAD suggested that the active site arginine could act as the positively charged group near the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus and responsible for stabilization of anionic flavin forms (15Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This basic residue has been identified in the primary sequence of RgDAAO, by irreversible inhibition using phenylglyoxal (16Gadda G. Negri A. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17809-17814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the question regarding its role was not solved. More recently, the resolution of the crystal structure of pkDAAO in complex with benzoate and anthranilate (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showed that Arg283interacts with the carboxylate group of the ligand and that the negative charge on the N(1)-C(2)=O locus of the flavin is stabilized by the dipole of α-helix F5. This result was apparently in contrast with the previous reports (see above). The crystal structure of RgDAAO has been recently solved at very high resolution (up to 1.2 Å), as a basis for the interpretation of the mechanistic studies and to find a rationale of its high catalytic efficiency. 2S. Umhau, L. Pollegioni, G. Molla, K. Diederichs, W. Welte, M. S. Pilone, and S. Ghisla, submitted for publication.2S. Umhau, L. Pollegioni, G. Molla, K. Diederichs, W. Welte, M. S. Pilone, and S. Ghisla, submitted for publication. The structure of oxidized enzyme in complex with the quasi-substrate CF3-alanine and of reduced enzyme in complex with the substrate d-alanine, revealed the mode of substrate binding (Fig. 1 A). The α-carboxylic group of the d-amino acid interacts electrostatically with the γ- and ε-amino groups of Arg285 (at ∼2.8 Å) and it is H-bonded with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr223 and Tyr238. The substrate α-amino group is H-bonded symmetrically with the backbone C=O group of Ser335 and the active site water molecule H2O72, while the substrate side chain is oriented toward the hydrophobic binding pocket of the active site (see Fig. 1 A). At the same time, we are substantiating the role of the active site residues of RgDAAO by site-directed mutagenesis of each single residue. In a previous paper we reported the effect of substitution of Tyr223 with a phenylalanine and a serine (18Harris C.M. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36233-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The characterization of the corresponding mutant RgDAAO's allowed us to exclude that Tyr223 can act as an active-site base, and highlighted its importance for the correct orientation of the bound substrate, as required for an efficient catalysis. We report here on the characterization of four single points mutants obtained by substitution of Arg285. The combination of the information derived from the site-directed mutagenesis studies and from the crystal structures confirms the involvement of Arg285 in substrate binding, but put forward a possible role in stabilization of the negative charge on the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus in the free enzyme. DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this paper demonstrate that the conserved Arg285 plays different roles at the active site of RgDAAO. We successfully expressed in E. coli four RgDAAO mutants at position Arg285 using the pT7-DAAO expression system (21Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and purified them to homogeneity as holoenzyme with a good yield (≥20%). The mutation of Arg285 results in no gross perturbation or loss of FAD, thus the observed changes are due to only specific and local structural modifications. The main role of this residue in substrate binding has been substantiated by the known three-dimensional structure of mammalian DAAO (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and, recently, from the structure at high resolution of RgDAAO.2 In the latter, the structure of the reduced enzyme-d-alanine complex at 1.2-Å resolution reveals the mode of substrate binding (Fig. 1 A): the carboxylate position of the amino acid is electrostatically bound via a two-point interaction with the γ- and ε-amino group of Arg285 (at a distance of 2.79 Å).2 The large decrease in substrate affinity (and ligand binding) observed with the mutant enzymes is well explained by the involvement of this arginine residue in binding and fixation (Fig.1 A). The ligand-binding experiments demonstrate that the overall substrate binding pocket is largely altered even when a conservative mutation, as in the case of the R285K mutant, is present (Table III).The change in flavin redox potentials of R285K and the thermodynamic instability of the semiquinone form in all mutants profoundly distinguish them from the wild-type DAAO. At the moment, only the three-dimensional structure of RgDAAO and pkDAAO in complex with a substrate or a ligand is available (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).2 In this structure, the isoalloxazine ring is located in a hydrophobic environment making contacts with the side chain of different residues but, differently from pkDAAO and from other flavoproteins (6Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), no basic residue(s) or α-helix dipole is properly located to interact with the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O position.2 A (partial) positive charge in proximity of this flavin locus is required to stabilize several anionic flavin derivatives (e.g. the N(5) covalent adduct with sulfite). Since the ε-amino group of Arg285 in RgDAAO is ∼7 Å far away from the N(1)-C(2)=O flavin position (in the EFlred-d-alanine complex), it cannot stabilize the negative charge on the flavin.2 We suggest that in the free enzyme form (i.e. in the absence of a ligand) the side chain of Arg285 is able to rotate to a distance of ∼3 Å from the N(1)-C(2)=O flavin locus (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the lack of the guanidinium group of Arg285 in the mutants determines the absence of the counterion required for stabilization of flavin semiquinone. This lower stabilization is further supported by the ∼104-fold increase in K d for binding of sulfite (Table III). Moreover, we are tempted to conclude that a similar function is exerted by Arg283 in the mammalian DAAO, and thus to give a rationale of the results obtained from chemical modification studies (15Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ferti C. Curti B. Simonetta M.S. Ronchi S. Galliano M. Minchiotti L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, the inferred interaction of Arg283 with the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus in the free form of pkDAAO could explain the observation that the chemical modification of this residue destroyed the ability of pkDAAO to stabilize the benzoquinoid form of 8-mercapto-FAD and to form an N(5)-adduct with sulfite (15Fitzpatrick P.F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9700-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The crystal structure of oxidized DAAO in complex withl-lactate and of reduced enzyme complexed withd-alanine shows that the side chain of Arg285is at >5 Å from the α-CH group of the substrate. Thereby, in this position Arg285 is far way from the reactive α-hydrogen and cannot be the active site base required by a carbanion mechanism for substrate dehydrogenation. In fact, all the Arg285mutants we produced possess appreciable dehydrogenase activity (they can be anaerobically reduced by the substrate d-alanine). On the other hand, the large decrease in the rate of flavin reduction (and therefore in turnover) is quite surprising. Thek cat for R285K and R285A are decreased by about 450- and 7000-fold, respectively, in comparison to the wild-type RgDAAO (12Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this change is accompanied by a parallel decrease in the rate of flavin reduction (Table IV). Since k 2 is still rate-limiting, we can rule out a change in the kinetic mechanism. A main kinetic difference with respect to the wild-type DAAO is that, due to the large decrease in k 2,k 3 ≫ k 2 for the Arg285 mutants and thus the reductive half-reaction is essentially monophasic. The effect of Arg285 substitution on RgDAAO catalysis can be explained in terms of the recently proposed mechanism in which “orbital steering/interactions are the predominant or the sole important factors in catalysis.”2 The perturbation of the active site in the Arg285 mutants modifies the precise substrate alignment: alteration of the reaction trajectory results in a large change in the reaction velocity (k red and k cat). A similar large effect has been also reported for the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase, as a consequence of small trajectory changes via substrate modification and metal co-ordination (17Mesecar A.D. Stoddard B.L. Koshland D.E. Science. 1997; 277: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Actually, a second possibility has also to be taken into account, namely that an equilibrium form of the enzyme-substrate complex exists, in which the guanidinium side chain of Arg285 is no longer in contact with the carboxylate but it reaches a position in which it could abstract the proton from the α-carbon of the substrate.The mechanism by which substrate dehydrogenation occurs in DAAO cannot be solved solely on the basis of structural data, thus new investigations are required to rule out definitively the possibility that Arg285 could be the acid/base residue required by a carbanion-type mechanism. Our results support the concept that precise binding and orientation of the substrate is a main quantitative factor in RgDAAO catalysis. Albeit the lack of the free enzyme crystal structure, the novel hypothesis on a conformational swing of the side chain of Arg285 from the position (seen in the structure) in which it binds the carboxylate anion, to a different one (next to the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus) in the free enzyme form, fits with the interpretation of the whole body of data. Moreover, the model we have proposed permits a reconciliation of the apparently contradictory conclusions that arose from the three-dimensional structure and from chemical modification studies of pkDAAO (4Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Mizutani H. Miyahara I.

This periodic pattern of CPD formation reflects the bending of DNA molecules on the histone surface (8Brown D.W. Libertini L.J. Suquet C. Small E.W. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10527-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Pehrson J.R. Cohen L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Liu X. Mann D.B. Suquet C. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), where the periodic compression of the minor grove of DNA may modulate the [2 + 2]cyclo addition of adjacent 5–6 double bonds after UV photon absorption (11Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 12Cadet J. Anselmino C. Douki T. Voituriez L. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 15: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Indeed, CPDs cause an overall bend of 7°–9° in the long axis of a double-strand DNA molecule (13Wang C.I. Taylor J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Kim J.K. Patel D. Choi B.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), with possibly significant distortion of the phosphodiester backbone on each side of the CPD site (15McAteer K. Jing Y. Kao J. Taylor J.S. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1013-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and this may be facilitated by compression of the minor groove of adjacent pyrimidines. DNA repair in chromatin has been extensively examined in human diploid fibroblasts, where two distinct phases exist in the time course of repair in the genome overall (6Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Smerdon M.J. Lambert M.W. Laval J. DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Biological Implications in Mammalian Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 271-294Crossref Google Scholar). There is an early rapid phase (lasting 3–6 h after irradiation) and a late slow phase starting between 5 and 16 h after irradiation, depending on the cell strain. It was shown that repair synthesis is randomly distributed in nucleosome core DNA during the late repair phase, whereas there is a distinct bias toward the 5′ ends of core DNA during the early repair phase (17Lan S.Y. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7771-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Jensen K.A. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4773-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, during each of these phases, CPDs are repaired at almost equal rates on the inner and outer faces of the DNA helix, relative to the histone surface (18Jensen K.A. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4773-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This suggests that DNA repair enzymes make little distinction between CPDs on different sides of the DNA helix in most of the nucleosomes in human chromatin. Nucleosome structure can modulate nucleotide excision repair (NER) in the non-transcribed strand of an active gene in yeast (19Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nucleosome assembly of specific sequences significantly inhibits the action of both UV photolyase and T4 endonuclease V (T4 endo V) at specific CPD sites in vitro (20Schieferstein U. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, even though these enzymes have much different catalytic activities at CPD sites (11Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), nucleosome assembly strongly inhibits the activities in each case. In this report, a 175-bp fragment containing the Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S rRNA gene was used to examine the effects of nucleosome assembly on DNA repair by Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts. This combination of “substrate” and repair extract was chosen because the 175-bp Xenopus somatic 5 S rRNA gene fragment forms just a few well positioned nucleosomes in vitro (10Liu X. Mann D.B. Suquet C. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6829-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts have a robust NER activity (23Oda N. Saxena J.K. Jenkins T.M. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13816-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These features allowed us to examine the efficiency of removal of CPDs at specific sites within subdomains of a rotationally positioned nucleosome. The [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) used in this study was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. SexAI and SalI were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. T4 endo V was a generous gift from Dr. R. S. Lloyd (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). After linearization of plasmid pKS-5S (24Mann D.B. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with either SexAI (for labeling the transcribed strand) or SalI (for labeling the non-transcribed strand), DNA was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A second restriction enzyme digestion (SalI for transcribed strand labeling and SexAI for non-transcribed strand labeling) produced a single end-labeled DNA fragment containing 108 bp of the 5 S rRNA gene (see Fig. 1). The resulting 175-bp DNA fragment was recovered from a 2% agarose gel using a QIAEXII gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The DNA samples were diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to a final DNA concentration of 50 ng/μl, irradiated under two low pressure Hg lamps (Sylvania, model G30T8) providing predominantly 254-nm light at a flux of 4.3 W/m2. UV flux was measured with a Spectroline DM-254N UV meter (Spectronics Corp.). Nucleosome core particles depleted of linker histones (H1 and H5) were prepared from chicken erythrocytes (Lampire Biological Laboratories) as described by Libertini et al. (25Libertini L.J. Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Small E.W. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Core histones were characterized on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15 × 17 cm) run at 200 volts for ∼3.5 h. Core histones were depleted of their N-terminal tails by trypsin digestion as described by others (20Schieferstein U. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Briefly, core particles (7.7 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm cacodylate, 0.2 mm EDTA) were adjusted to 50 mm NaCl, mixed with 0.74 mg/ml trypsin (type XIII, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated, Sigma) to make a final trypsin concentration of 6 μg/ml. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with the addition of chicken egg white trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml. The digestion time was determined by visualizing the tailless histones on SDS gels as above. Reconstitution was achieved by histone octamer transfer as described previously (24Mann D.B. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of end-labeled 5 S rDNA was mixed with 42 μg of chicken erythrocyte core particles (∼20 μg of DNA) in 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF for 30 min at 4 °C. The final concentrations of 5 S rDNA and chicken erythrocyte core DNA in the reconstitution mixture was 0.63 ng/μl and 0.53 μg/μl, respectively. The samples were dialyzed against 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF for 12 h at 4 °C and then 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF for 4 h at 4 °C to complete the reconstitution. As a mock control, naked 5 S rDNA was also mixed with core particles in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 50 mm NaCl without stepwise dialysis. DNA mobility shift was used to examine the fraction of 5 S rDNA nucleosomes in the reconstituted population. DNA band shifts were observed on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8.3 × 10.2 cm) in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.3) run for 1.2 h at 120 V. The fraction of 5 S rDNA reconstituted was determined from integration of the two bands, as described below. Both enzymatic and chemical cleavage methods were carried out to further characterize the 5 S rDNA nucleosomes. Exonuclease III digestions were carried out with 9 μl (∼6 ng of 5 S rDNA) of naked 5 S rDNA or reconstituted nucleosomes and incubated with 100 units of exonuclease III (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for different times in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was stopped with 0.1× volume of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% SDS, and 50 mm EDTA, as described (27Neubauer B. Horz W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 630-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For DNase I digestions, 9 μl of reconstituted nucleosomes (6 ng of 5 S rDNA) were treated with 7 units of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 or 2 min at room temperature, whereas 0.35 units of DNase I were used to digest the same amount of naked DNA for 1.5 or 3 min at room temperature (28Lutter L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 × volume of 25 mm EDTA. Hydroxyl radical footprinting was carried out on 9 μl of reconstituted nucleosomes (∼6 ng of 5 S rDNA) after dilution to 20 μl with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) (29Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). After incubation with 2 μl of 20 mm sodium ascorbate, 2 μl of 0.4 mm Fe-EDTA, and 2 μl of 1.5% or 3% H2O2 for 2 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 0.1 m thiourea and 2 μl of 0.2 m EDTA. After each of the reactions described above, the DNA samples were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and run on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea DNA sequencing gel (see below). Repair incubation with Xenopusoocyte nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (23Oda N. Saxena J.K. Jenkins T.M. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13816-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Conconi A. Liu X. Koriazova L. Ackerman E. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Naked DNA or reconstituted nucleosomes containing ∼6 ng of 5 S rDNA were mixed with 2 μl of Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts in 20 μl of J-buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 70 mmKCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 10% glycerol). The repair mixture also contained 0.25 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and CTP. All repair reactions were incubated at 25 °C for the time periods indicated in the text. Reactions were stopped by freezing the samples at −80 °C. Before T4 endo V digestion, DNA was phenol extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in T4 endo V digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). T4 endo V (1 μl of a 200-fold dilution of enzyme stock (400 ng/μl)) was then added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the addition of sequencing gel loading buffer (0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cylanol, 20 mm EDTA in deionized formamide) to stop the reaction, samples were heat-denatured and run on (29 × 96 cm) 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea DNA sequencing gels for 2.5 h at 1600 volts (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gels were then vacuum-dried, exposed to (43 × 35 cm) PhosphorImager screens, and visualized on a Molecular Dynamics (model 445-P90) PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). Band intensities were quantified using ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics) and PeakFit 4.0 (SPSS, Inc.) software. Broad scans of each gel lane (∼3/4 of the width) were obtained with ImageQuaNT software, and nested peaks were deconvoluted before integration with PeakFit software using basis spectrum line shapes of Gaussian plus Lorentzian curves (32Li, S., Waters, R., and Smerdon, M. J. (2000) Methods: A Companion to Method in Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In most cases, loading differences were corrected by normalizing the intensity of each band to the sum of all bands in a lane. The fraction of CPDs at each site was plotted for different incubation times, and the t½ values (time for 50% of the initial damage to be removed) was determined from fits to these data. For Fig. 8, the absolute value rather than the relative percentage of each band was used due to the fact that most of the bands run off the gel. The relative percentage of a particular band (corresponding to a specific CPD site) within each lane was used to calculate the percent repair at different times. The average CPDs per strand was calculated from the intensity of the intact fragment resistant to T4 endo V, assuming a Poisson distribution of UV damaged fragments, as described by Bohr et al. (33Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). A diagrammatic representation of the 175-bp 5 S rDNA fragment used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. The ovals show the two major positions of the 5 S nucleosome relative to the various elements of the 5 S rRNA gene determined by Panetta et al. (34Panetta G. Buttinelli M. Flaus A. Richmond T.J. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for a longer DNA fragment (249 bp) with the Xenopus somatic 5 S rRNA gene. Nucleosomes were reconstituted onto 5 S rDNA fragments by histone octamer exchange from chicken erythrocyte (CE) core particles isolated from H1/H5-stripped chromatin (25Libertini L.J. Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Small E.W. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that these CE core particles contained stoichiometric amounts of intact core histones and were depleted of histones H1 and H5 (data not shown). The CE histone octamers were reconstituted onto 5 S rDNA by exchange in high salt followed by stepwise dialysis (see “Material and Methods”). DNA band shift analysis was used to monitor nucleosome formation with both irradiated and non-irradiated 5 S rDNA fragments, and under these conditions, at least 90% of the fragments were reconstituted into nucleosomes (Fig.2 A). Moreover, band shift experiments showed that nucleosomes are stable for at least 4 h during repair incubation (data not shown). To characterize these 5 S rDNA nucleosomes, three different types of footprinting were performed (Fig. 2 B). Exonuclease III is a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease that can be used to map the translational position of nucleosomes on DNA (27Neubauer B. Horz W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 630-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This enzyme will pause at the edge of nucleosomes and proceed more slowly into nucleosome core DNA with ∼10-bp pauses (27Neubauer B. Horz W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 630-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, naked DNA was quickly digested by exonuclease III into short fragments (lanes 1 and 2), whereas the 5 S rDNA nucleosomes were digested much more slowly (lanes 3 and 4). A major block to digestion occurred at position +65 ± 3 followed by two (less prominent) bands at 10-base intervals from this band, indicating the nucleosome core edge is at (or near) this position. This observation indicates that the most prominent nucleosome core setting spans bases −67 (5′ end of fragment) to +65 in the 175-bp fragment. This yields a 131-bp nucleosome core with a translational setting closest to the position having a nucleosome dyad at −3 (shaded oval in Fig. 1; Ref. 34Panetta G. Buttinelli M. Flaus A. Richmond T.J. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both DNase I and hydroxyl radical digestion provide information about the rotational setting of DNA in nucleosomes. DNase I cuts the phosphate backbone from the minor groove, which is restricted when facing the histone surface, yielding an ∼10-base repeat pattern on denaturing gels (reviewed in Ref. 28Lutter L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Naked DNA is cut more randomly than nucleosome DNA, although the enzyme has a strong sequence bias (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). With hydroxyl radical cleavage, however, there is much less sequence specificity (29Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and these two methods complement each other when evaluating the rotational setting of DNA in nucleosomes. The most intense cleavage sites on the 5 S nucleosome by hydroxyl radical occurred at −46, −36, −25, −15, −5, +6, +17, +27, +37, +47, and +57 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11 and 12). DNase I cuts preferentially within 1 nucleotide (nt) of most of these same nucleosome 5 S rDNA sites (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7 and 8). We note that an intense DNase I cut site, but not hydroxyl radical cut site, also occurs at −31, being strong in both naked 5 S rDNA and the 5 S nucleosome (star in Fig.2 B, lanes 5–8). This reflects the strong sequence specificity of DNase I (28Lutter L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results are in good agreement with previous studies on the rotational setting of 5 S rDNA in nucleosomes (22Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6829-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Contrary to the low repair efficiency found in cultured mammalian cell extracts (e.g. 35Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts remove almost all CPDs from irradiated exogenous DNA within a few hours (23Oda N. Saxena J.K. Jenkins T.M. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13816-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, these extracts were chosen for examining repair of CPDs in the 5 S rDNA nucleosome, since CPD removal at specific sites could be followed. For these experiments, the 175-bp 5 S rDNA fragment was UV irradiated, reconstituted into nucleosomes, and incubated with oocyte nuclear extracts as described in Conconiet al. (30Conconi A. Liu X. Koriazova L. Ackerman E. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After different incubation times, 5 S rDNA was purified, cut with T4 endo V, and run on DNA sequencing gels as above. As shown in Fig. 3, repair of most CPDs in either strand of 5 S rDNA (or the disappearance of bands) was strongly inhibited by nucleosome assembly (compare D and N lanes). The decreased intensity of CPD bands should be accompanied by an increased intensity of the whole length (or uncut) fragment, which reflects the overall repair of the 5 S rDNA fragment. As shown in Fig. 4, the overall repair efficiency of each strand decreases upon nucleosome formation (comparesolid to dashed lines), in complete agreement with the trend at individual CPD sites observed in Fig. 3.Figure 4Time course of overall CPD removal from the transcribed strand (A) and non-transcribed strand (B) of the 5 S rDNA fragment. The percentage of intact (uncut) 175-base 5 S rDNA fragment at different repair times was determined for each strand in naked DNA (D, ○) and nucleosomes (N, ●) from gels such as shown in Fig. 3. Data represent the mean ± 1 S.D. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results can be compared by determining the percentage of CPDs remaining at each site after different times of repair incubation. Three examples are shown in Fig. 5 for different short tracts of CPD sites (denoted by stars in Fig. 3). Clearly, naked DNA has different repair rates than nucleosomal DNA at two of these sites (+21CTTTC+25and +54TTC+56). Furthermore, these slower repaired CPDs in nucleosomal DNA were removed at different rates from each other (compare top and middle panels in Fig.5). Interestingly, a few CPD sites in nucleosomes were repaired almost as rapidly as naked DNA (e.g. site+58TCCC+61, Fig. 5, bottom panel). The structural features of these sites are discussed below (see “Discussion”). The t½ value of each CPD site was determined from its repair curve, and these values are compared graphically over the entire 5 S rDNA fragment in Fig. 6. Most CPD sites in naked DNA have t½ values of less than 2 h (Fig. 6, closed bars). However, careful inspection of several different gels and subsequent quantitation of the results indicates that the rate of repair at individual sites in naked 5 S rDNA is quite variable. For example, extremely fast repair is observed at sites CT+42, +54TTC+56,+58TCCC+61, +64CCC+66, CC+71, and TC+75 of the TS, whereas sites−59TCTCCT−54 of the TS and+28CCC+30 of the NTS are repaired much more slowly. This variation in site-specific repair does not correlate with initial yields of CPDs at these sites (data not shown) and, therefore, may reflect an influence by neighboring DNA sequence and/or local DNA structure on damage recognition or removal. Compared with naked DNA, repair of CPDs in 5 S rDNA nucleosomes is slower at almost all sites, with most t½ values being >2 h (Fig. 6, shaded bars). Moreover, some CPD sites just outside of the predominant nucleosome location (i.e. positions larger than +80 of the TS) are also repaired slower. This may in part be due to the variation in nucleosome translational settings and/or binding of the DNA ends by exposed basic residues on the histone tails. However, some CPD sites continue to be repaired efficiently in the nucleosome complex (e.g. +58TCCC+61, Figs. 5 and 6). In addition, the time course of repair at individual CPD sites relative to the other sites observed for naked DNA are different from those observed for nucleosomes. For example, one slow repair site of naked DNA,+28CCC+30 of NTS, is repaired at an intermediate rate in nucleosomes. Repair at sites−28TTCC−25 and+21CTTTC+25 of the TS is fast in naked DNA but very slow in nucleosomes. Thus, repair at CPD sites in 5 S rDNA appears to be differentially modulated by nucleosome assembly. The N-terminal tails of the core histones containing a high proportion of basic amino acids may play important roles in stabilizing nucleosome structure, particularly in polynucleosome fragments (36Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine their effect on NER of mononucleosomes, the histone tails were removed from CE nucleosomes by trypsin digestion, as described by Ausioet al. (26Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the tails are efficiently removed from the four core histones as demonstrated by their increased migration on SDS gels (Fig.7 A). As expected, when these CE nucleosomes are used for reconstitution, the 5 S rDNA nucleosomes migrate faster than the intact 5 S rDNA nucleosomes on native gels (Fig. 7 B). Importantly, the fraction of nucleosomes reconstituted with the trypsin-digested CE core particles does not change appreciably (Fig. 7 B). However, removal of the histone tails does not significantly enhance NER in 5 S rDNA mononucleosomes. As shown in Fig. 7 C for CPDs in the 3′ half of the fragment (−67 to +65), repair of the histone tail-depleted nucleosomes is very similar to that of intact 5 S rDNA nucleosomes (compare + and − trypsin lanes). Similar results were obtained for CPDs in the 5′ half of the fragment (data not shown). Therefore, the histone tails in these mononucleosomes must play only a minor role in the modulation of NER in the 5 S rDNA nucleosome. Finally, we examined the correlation between site-specific NER and the rotational setting of 5 S rDNA on the histone surface. For these experiments, a 14-nt long pyrimidine tract in the transcribed strand was analyzed in detail, since it spans"
https://openalex.org/W1992159215,"The primary structure of humanElastin microfibrilinterface-located protein (EMILIN), an elastic fiber-associated glycoprotein, consists of a globular C1q domain (gC1q) at the C terminus, a short collagenous stalk, a long region with a high potential for forming coiled-coil α helices, and a cysteine-rich N-terminal sequence. It is not known whether the EMILIN gC1q domain is involved in the assembly process and in the supramolecular organization as shown for the similar domain of collagen X. By employing the yeast two-hybrid system the EMILIN gC1q domains interacted with themselves, proving for the first time that this interaction occurs in vivo. The gC1q domain formed oligomers running as trimers in native gels that were less stable than the comparable trimers of the collagen X gC1q domain since they did not withstand heating. The collagenous domain was trypsin-resistant and migrated at a size corresponding to a triple helix under native conditions. In reducing agarose gels, EMILIN also migrated as a trimer, whereas under non-reducing conditions it formed polymers of many millions of daltons. A truncated fragment lacking gC1q and collagenous domains assembled to a much lesser extent, thus deducing that the C-terminal domain(s) are essential for the formation of trimers that finally assemble into large EMILIN multimers. The primary structure of humanElastin microfibrilinterface-located protein (EMILIN), an elastic fiber-associated glycoprotein, consists of a globular C1q domain (gC1q) at the C terminus, a short collagenous stalk, a long region with a high potential for forming coiled-coil α helices, and a cysteine-rich N-terminal sequence. It is not known whether the EMILIN gC1q domain is involved in the assembly process and in the supramolecular organization as shown for the similar domain of collagen X. By employing the yeast two-hybrid system the EMILIN gC1q domains interacted with themselves, proving for the first time that this interaction occurs in vivo. The gC1q domain formed oligomers running as trimers in native gels that were less stable than the comparable trimers of the collagen X gC1q domain since they did not withstand heating. The collagenous domain was trypsin-resistant and migrated at a size corresponding to a triple helix under native conditions. In reducing agarose gels, EMILIN also migrated as a trimer, whereas under non-reducing conditions it formed polymers of many millions of daltons. A truncated fragment lacking gC1q and collagenous domains assembled to a much lesser extent, thus deducing that the C-terminal domain(s) are essential for the formation of trimers that finally assemble into large EMILIN multimers. tumor necrosis factor extracellular matrix globular C1q domain polymerase chain reaction von Willebrand factor mB, mC, mammalian construct A, B, C prokaryote construct B yB, yeast construct A, B polymerase chain reaction leucine zipper polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside collagenous Elastin microfibril interface-located protein (EMILIN) belongs to the C1q/TNF1 superfamily of proteins (1Doliana R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and is a considerable component of the elastic fiber system. Elastic fibers confer the properties of resiliency and elastic recoil to connective tissues and are secreted in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of many tissues in various forms. In the elastic ligaments they are deposited as solid branching and unbranching fine and thick rod-like fibers, in the blood vessels as concentric sheets of lamellae, in the elastic cartilages as a three-dimensional meshwork of fine fibrils, and in skin and lung as a combination of these (2Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. 2. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 95-140Google Scholar). As previously studied in the chick model, the major characteristics of EMILIN, first extracted by means of denaturating and reducing agents, are as follows. It is preferentially extracted from tissues using buffers containing guanidine HCl and reducing agents; it forms a fibrillar network in the ECM of in vitro grown smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and in the ECM of several tissues including blood vessels, skin, heart, lung, kidney, and cornea; it codistributes with elastin in most sites (3Bressan G.M.

Daga-Gordini D. Colombatti A. Castellani I. Marigo V. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); finally and more important for the functional significance of EMILIN, the process of in vitroelastin deposition was perturbed by the addition of anti-EMILIN antibodies to the culture medium suggesting that this protein plays a leading role during the elastic fiber formation process (8Bressan G.M. Daga-Gordini D. Colombatti A. Castellani I. Marigo V. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, the primary structure of the human EMILIN has been elucidated (1Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mature form of this multimodular protein consists of 996 amino acids and differs from all other elastin-associated proteins; the domain organization includes a C1q-like globular domain (gC1q) at the C terminus, a short uninterrupted collagenous stalk, a region containing two leucine zippers, and at least four heptad repeats with a high potential for forming coiled-coil α helices. At the N terminus, a cysteine-rich sequence (EMI domain) 2R. Doliana, P. Bonaldo, and A. Colombatti, submitted for publication.2R. Doliana, P. Bonaldo, and A. Colombatti, submitted for publication. is homologous to a region of multimerin (9Hayward C.P.M. Warkentin T.E. Horsewood P. Kelton J.G. Blood. 1991; 77: 2556-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a diagram showing the EMILIN structure is shown in Fig. 1). The gC1q domain is shared with several other ECM constituents including type VIII and type X collagens in which it represents the equivalent of the C-propeptide of fibrillar collagens, and it is believed to play a similar function. While type X collagen is specifically expressed in hypertrophic cartilage (10Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1985; 107: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), type VIII collagen is found both in the subendothelium and in the elastin-rich tunica media (11Sage H. Pritzl P. Bornstein P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5747-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Kittleberger R. Davis P.F. Greenhill N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of blood vessels where it is thought to be a crucial element of the structure. Thus, like EMILIN, type VIII collagen is a significant component of the various proteins associated with elastin-rich tissue. Unlike the fibrillar procollagens, the C-propeptides (i.e. the gC1q domains) of type VIII and X collagens are not cleaved following secretion into the ECM but are thought to play a similar role in the initial chain selection and trimerization of the triple helix and in the assembly of the individual triple-helical monomers into higher order structures (13Barber R.E. Kwan A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all mutations detected in Schmid type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia have been located in the gC1q domain and have been proposed to affect the initial stages of type X collagen folding and assembly (14Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Supportive evidence was later provided by rotary shadowing data; the gC1q domains, which are highly hydrophobic, appeared to exert a primary role in the aggregation of type X collagen molecules (16Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 258: 9504-9509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Currently the oligomerization state of EMILIN and the exact nature of the forces stabilizing EMILIN assemblies have not been identified. Preliminary data from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run under nonreducing conditions revealed that intracellularly EMILIN behaved as a monomeric protein. Once secreted from the cell it underwent intermolecular cross-linking by disulfide bonds giving rise to high molecular weight aggregates (7Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17534-17540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that S–S bond formation might be a contributing factor in multimer organization (7Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17534-17540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the putative oligomerization of EMILIN, we investigated the self-association of the gC1q domain and of the entire molecule and found that formation of EMILIN trimers depends on the gC1q domain and that further multimerization is apparently mediated solely by S–S bonds. To study the EMILIN intermolecular interactions, several constructs encoding LexA fusion proteins containing the C-terminal domains (see below) were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing 1 ng of EMILIN-pGEM-T as a template (1Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), 10 pm each primer (see below), 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega Corp.), and 0.2 mm each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Pharmacia Ultrapure, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primers used were the following: sense 5′-GGGAATTCGGCCAGTGCCCCAGCTTAGA-3′ and antisense 5′-CC CCATGGCTACGCGTGTTCAAGCTCTGG-3′ for the construct yA which includes the gC1q, the collagenous (COL), and the leucine zipper (LZ) domains, from position 2152–3051 of the published sequence (GenBankTM Data base, accession number AF088916); the sense 5′-GGGAATTCGCCCCTGTGCCCCAAGTGGCAT-3′ in combination with the previous antisense primer used for the construct yA for the construct yB including the gC1q domain only. The underlined bases correspond to appended EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme recognition sites plus two additional protective nucleotides. The amplification was performed for 25 cycles with a temperature profile of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. The PCR fragments, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, were purified with High Pure Cartridges (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), ligated overnight in both pLexA and pB42AD vectors (CLONTECH) expressing the binding and the activation domains, respectively, and transformed in Escherichia coli competent DH5a strain. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened for the presence of the inserts by restriction analysis. The nucleotide sequence of candidate constructs were determined, and the selected plasmids were used in the yeast transformation assay. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains EGY48 [p8op-lacZ] (MATα, his3, trp1, ura3, LexAop(x6)-LEU2) carrying the reporter plasmid p8pop-LacZ and YM4271 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, ade5, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, tyr1-501, gal4-d512, gal80-D538, ade5-hisG) were used for the present assays. Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in either YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or SD minimal medium (0, 5% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and 1% desired amino acid dropout solution). Growth and manipulation of yeast strains was carried out using the procedures described in the Matchmaker Two-hybrid system user manual (CLONTECH). The hybrid constructs (pLexA-yA or -yB and pBA2AD-yA or -yB) were sequentially transformed into the EGY48 popLacZ yeast reporter strain by the PEG/lithium acetate transformation procedure, using the YEASTMAKERTM yeast transformation system kit (CLONTECH). Transformants were allowed to grow at 30 °C usually for 2–3 days in SD-his-trp-ura medium and then in SD/Gal/Raf/−his/−leu/−trp/−ura/X-gal selective medium. The Leu+, LacZ+-positive clones were subjected to a mating assay to confirm the protein-protein interaction. Briefly, the plasmids containing the fusion proteins were individually transfected in either EGY48 [p8op-lacZ] or YM4271 yeast strains. The two transformed strains were simultaneously incubated in YPD medium at 30 °C for 18 h, and an aliquot was plated onto SD/−His/−Trp/−Ura plates. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 days, the diploid cells forming visible colonies were picked up and streaked on SD/Gal/Raf/−his/−leu/−trp/−ura/X-Gal-containing plates. Blue colonies usually appeared between 24 and 120 h. As a positive control we used the p53 protein fused to the LexA binding domain and the SV40 large T cell antigen as a prey. Negative controls consisted of EGY48 transformed with one of the following constructs: pLexA-yA or -yB; plexA-lam; and pB42 AD-yA or -yB. The sequence corresponding to the C-terminal domain of EMILIN (gC1q construct pB) was amplified from the EMILIN-pGEM-T template (see above) with the same primers used for generating yB, in which the 5′-ends were replaced with the BamHI andKpnI recognition sites for sense and antisense primers, respectively. It was then ligated in frame in the His6-tagged pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen GmbH) and transformed in M15 cells. Positive clones were isolated, and the cloned fragment was sequenced in both directions to check for errors generated by PCR. Five hundred ml of liquid culture grown at 0.6 ODA 600 nm was induced with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The culture was then centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 20 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3m NaCl) at 5 volumes/g of wet weight. The samples were frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, thawed in cold water, and sonicated on ice (1-min bursts/1-min cooling/2–300 watts), and cell breakage was monitored by measuring the release of nucleic acids atA 260 nm. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min; the supernatant was collected, and purification of the different domains was performed by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen GmbH) under native conditions. The recombinant protein was eluted from the affinity column in sonication buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10% glycerol, and 0.2 m imidazole. After dialysis against 25 mm Na3PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, the native status of the polypeptide was checked by CD spectra analysis. In order to express high amounts of distinct EMILIN constructs, the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCEP-Pu/AC7 containing the BM-40 signal peptide (17Kohnfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) was employed. The cloned fragments included the following: 1) the entire coding sequence of the putative mature EMILIN obtained by ligating a 5′ PCR-amplified fragment (from position 64 to 2268) to a 3′ fragment (from position 2266 to 3051) (EMILIN); 2) a frameshifted construct extending from position 64 and including only the first and half of the second LZ bearing a stop codon at position 2426 (EMILIN-T); 3) the mA construct that includes the leucine zipper domains, the collagenous domain, and the gC1q-like domain (LEU-COL-gC1q)(from position 2152 to 3051); 4) the mC construct including the collagenous and the gC1q domains (COL-gC1q) only (from position 2440 to 3051). The PCR reactions for EMILIN and EMILIN-T constructs were performed as described previously (1Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) employing the sense primer, 5′-CTAGCTAGCGGG CCTCCTGGGCTGCAGGGAC-3′, in combination with the same antisense primer used for construct yA except for bearing a NotI site. The underlined bases correspond to the NheI recognition site plus one appended nucleotide. The same restriction sites were substituted in the oligonucleotides employed for priming the other two constructs. All amplified fragments were sequenced in both directions. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA, constitutively expressing the EBNA-1 protein from Epstein-Barr virus (Stratagene), was transfected by electroporation with the EMILIN constructs. Just before the transfection, a half-million cells were collected and resuspended in serum-free culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 25 mm NaCl and incubated for 5 min in the presence of 10 μg of DNA. The cells were electroporated and plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h later 500 ng/ml puromycin were added to the medium for the selection. Puromycin-resistant cells were selected and assayed for recombinant protein expression by precipitating the spent (10 min at 13,000 rpm) serum-free culture medium with 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and and 1% Triton X-100 and analyzing the precipitate by SDS-PAGE. To detect the production of COL-gC1q (mC) and LZ-COL-gC1q (mA) polypeptides, which were produced in lower amounts, the precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody against the recombinant human EMILIN (see below). A diagram with all the prokaryotic and eukaryotic constructs of human EMILIN is shown in Fig.1. 293-EBNA cells transfected with the various constructs were expanded to mass culture, and the cells were maintained for 2 days in serum-free medium. Partial purification was achieved by dialysis of the conditioned medium at 4 °C against 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (buffer A). Purification to near-homogeneity was achieved by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, equilibrated in the same buffer. The bound material was eluted from the DEAE-cellulose column with a NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1.2m ammonium sulfate (buffer B), and loaded onto a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8 (buffer C). Given the very large size of the EMILIN aggregate, the hydrophobic chromatography was substituted by a size exclusion chromatography purification step using Sepharose CL-4B (1.0 × 90.0 cm column). Rabbit antiserum against human EMILIN was obtained by subcutaneous immunization with 150 μg of purified recombinant protein. Before use the antiserum was absorbed onto a CNBr-activated Sepharose resin saturated with mock-transfected cell proteins. The antiserum was assayed for the reactivity against recombinant EMILIN (titer around 1:10,000) and against its recombinant domains by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum titer against unrelated proteins (COL VI, fibronectin, vitronectin, and elastin) was more than 100-fold lower. This antiserum stained the ECM of several human tissues including vessels, kidney, and subcutaneous tissue. For immunoblotting the various recombinant proteins and a reduced 6 mguanidine HCl human placenta extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nylon filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were shown to recognize all the recombinant EMILIN polypeptides (Fig.2 A) as well as genuine tissue EMILIN (Fig. 2 B). This latter migrated slightly less than EMILIN secreted by transfected 293-EBNA cells. “Native” electrophoresis in the absence of SDS or urea represents a useful technique for determining the native size and subunit structure of proteins; under these conditions mobility depends on size, shape, and intrinsic charge of the protein. Proteins of standard molecular size (nondenatured protein molecular weight marker kit, Sigma) and purified recombinant polypeptide samples were separated in a continuous electrophoresis system at pH 8.2, under nondenaturing conditions in 10, 12, and 15% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular size of a given protein is estimated in this system indirectly by the following method. The electrophoretic mobility (R f) of each protein relative to the tracking dye is determined on a set of gels of various polyacrylamide concentrations; 100 × log(R f × 100) is plotted against the percent gel concentration for each protein, and the slope of such a plot is the retardation coefficient (K R). From these various plots, individual slopes (K R) are determined for each protein, and the logarithm of the negative slope is plotted against the logarithm of the molecular size of each protein. This then produces a linear plot from which the molecular size of an unknown protein may be determined (18Hedrick J.L. Smith A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). For trypsin digestion the LZ-COL-gC1q (mA) polypeptide was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin for 16 h at 4 °C. At the end of the enzyme treatment, the digested proteins were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel under reducing and non-denaturing conditions. Aliquots of purified gC1q (pA) polypeptide were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and placed in a DNA gradient thermal cycler block (Robocycler, Stratagene). A stepwise temperature gradient was set up, and samples were subjected to a range of temperatures from 52 to 68 °C. At the end of the incubation, the samples were removed and resolved in SDS-PAGE. Samples in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis under both reducing and non-reducing conditions using 0.8% (w/v) high melting agarose (Seakem, FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) in the stacking gel and 1.4% (w/v) low melting agarose (Seakem) in the separating gel. vWF and fibronectin from human plasma obtained from healthy donors after informed consent were purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B columns (19De Marco L. Girolami A. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7424-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and by gelatin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (20Vuento M. Vaheri A. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), respectively. Murine IgM was purified by sequential precipitation with caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate (21Perosa F. Carbone R. Ferrone S. Dammacco F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 128: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) from the ascites of a mouse injected with an IgM-producing hybridoma. Murine laminin-1 was purified from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma tumor according to the procedure of Paulsson et al. (22Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These proteins were used as reference standards for EMILIN multimer size. The gC1q (pA) polypeptide was processed for CD spectroscopy analysis. A Jasco J-600 CD/ORD spectrophotometer interfaced to an Olidata computer for data collection was used for all the measurements. Calibration of the instruments was performed with d(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 290 nm. Standard conditions were 25 mm Na3PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, using a 0.2-cm path length cuvette and with a water bath at 10 °C. Then the spectra were analyzed using the Menendez-Arias program (23Menendez-Arias L. Gomez-Gutierrez J. Garcia-Fernandez M. Garcia- Tejedor A. Moran F. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 4: 479-482Google Scholar). Two distinct constructs corresponding to the C-terminal regions of EMILIN, construct yA (LZ-COL-gC1q) and construct yB (gC1q), were fused with both the DNA binding domain and with the activation domain of LexA. The hybrid constructs were sequentially transformed in the EGY48 yeast strain (popLacz) to check for their ability to self-activate the reporter genes LEU2 andlacZ and to enter the nucleus. The constructs were then transformed in different combinations (yA/yA, yB/yB and yA/yB) in the same yeast strain previously transfected with popLacZ. The interactions were assayed by plating transfectants on SD/Leu−, His−, Trp−, Ura and on SD/Leu−, His−, Trp−, Ura, Gal/Raf, X-gal agar plates. The growth of the yeast transfectants in the incomplete medium and the β-galactosidase activity were estimated. The EMILIN domains were shown to interact with each other in all combinations, were able to grow in the incomplete medium, and induced β-galactosidase activity to an extent comparable to that observed for the positive control (see Table I). Yeast cells transfected with both yA and yB constructs and the partner vector without any insert did not grow in the selective medium indicating that the activation of the reporter genes was due to the interaction of the EMILIN domains (data not shown). The binding was further verified by yeast mating, a system complementary to the cotransfection assay (24Finley R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (Table I). It is not clear if the leucine zipper domain enhances the interaction; however, for the first time we demonstrate that the gC1q domain, which in these experiments is the essential element for the binding, is able to self-assemble in vivo.Table IInteractions of different EMILIN constructs assessed by the two-hybrid systemConstructs yA and yB were fused with the DNA binding domains and the activation domains of LexA and cotransformed in different combinations (yA/yA; yB/yB, yA/yB). β-Galactosidase activity was revealed by plating transformants on X-gal containing agar and observing growth of blue colonies in comparison with that of positive and negative controls. The interaction was confirmed by using an alternative system, yeast mating, for transforming the EGY48 strain with one construct and the complementary mating YM4271 strain with the other construct. Plus signs refer to the high (+++), medium (++), and low (+) intensity of the blue color. Open table in a new tab Constructs yA and yB were fused with the DNA binding domains and the activation domains of LexA and cotransformed in different combinations (yA/yA; yB/yB, yA/yB). β-Galactosidase activity was revealed by plating transformants on X-gal containing agar and observing growth of blue colonies in comparison with that of positive and negative controls.

Plus signs refer to the high (+++), medium (++), and low (+) intensity of the blue color. The above experiments provided the initial information to conclude that the gC1q domain of EMILIN can interact with itself. However, the two-hybrid system is not informative as to whether this domain can form homotrimers. Thus, to investigate also whether the gC1q domain of EMILIN, in analogy with those of several of the other members of the C1q/TNF superfamily such as type X (25Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G.

https://openalex.org/W1976708124,"We describe a novel autoimmune disease characterized by severe subepidermal bullous eruptions and renal insufficiency with IgG autoantibodies directed against the NC1 domain of the α5(IV) collagen chain. In vivo deposits of IgG and C3 were found along the dermal-epidermal junction of skin lesions. The identity of the target antigen was determined by immunochemical analyses of candidate antigens using the patients' autoantibodies. The patients' IgG autoantibodies reacted with a 185-kDa polypeptide that was distinguished from the known autoantigens of the extracellular matrix including type XVII collagen, type VII collagen, or the α3, β3, and γ2 chains of laminin 5. Preincubation of the serum with recombinant α5(IV)NC1 domain of type IV collagen abolished immunoreactivity with the 185-kDa antigen. The serum reacted specifically with the α5(IV)NC1, among the six NC1 domains of type IV collagen, by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses. The patients' autoantibodies reacted with normal skin and renal glomerulus but not with skin and glomerulus of a patient with Alport syndrome in which the basement membranes are devoid of the α5(IV) collagen chain. This study provided for the first time unambiguous evidence for the α5(IV) collagen chain as the target antigen in a novel autoimmune disease characterized by skin and renal involvement.

To date, at least 19 different collagen types have been characterized in vertebrates, with different subunits representing as many as 30 distinct genes (1.Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The collagens usually comprise a central triple helical collagenous domain flanked by noncollagenous amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (NC1 and NC2). Three collagen types have been shown thus far to be the target of autoimmune response in human pathologies: (i) the NC1 domain of α3 chain of type IV collagen in Goodpasture syndrome (2.Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.P. Quinones S. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13374-13380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) the NC1 domain of type VII collagen in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA)1 (3.Woodley D. Briggaman R. O'Keefe E. Inman A. Queen L. Gammon W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and (iii) a noncollagenous segment of type XVII collagen in bullous pemphigoid (BP) (4.Diaz L. Ratrie 3., H. Saunders W. Futamura S. Squiquera H. Anhalt G. Giudice G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The α3(IV) collagen chain, present in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, is the target antigen in Goodpasture syndrome, a lethal form of autoimmune disease characterized by glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. Type VII collagen, which forms the anchoring fibrils at the cutaneous basement membrane zone (BMZ), is the target antigen in EBA, a subepidermal blistering skin disease. Type XVII collagen, also known as the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen and BPAG2, a constituent of anchoring filaments at the cutaneous BMZ, is recognized by IgG autoantibodies from patients with BP, a subepidermal blistering skin disease. Type IV collagen molecules form a network structure primarily in the basement membranes of various tissues. To date, six genetically distinct type IV collagen polypeptide chains, α1(IV)–α6(IV), have been described (Fig. 1) (5.Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains, encoded by COL4A1 andCOL4A2, respectively, are ubiquitous, whereas α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) chains, encoded by COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, and COL4A6, respectively, are present in a restricted tissue distribution. The α5(IV) and α6(IV) chains are both present at the dermal-epidermal junction (6.Peissel B. Geng L. Kalluri R. Kashtan C. Rennke H. Gallo G. Yoshioka K. Sun M. Hudson B. Neilson E. Zhou J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) make up the renal glomerular basement membrane (5.Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Peissel B. Geng L. Kalluri R. Kashtan C. Rennke H. Gallo G. Yoshioka K. Sun M. Hudson B. Neilson E. Zhou J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We here show that the α5 chain of type IV collagen is the target antigen in an autoimmune disease distinguishable from other autoimmune diseases described thus far on the basis of its clinical presentation and the antigenic specificity of the autoantibodies. Serum and lesional skin from two patients (patients 1 and 2) with subepidermal blisters and renal insufficiency were used in this study. The patients' clinical features are discussed elsewhere. 2R. F. Ghohestani, M. Sodeify, Y. Dowlati, A. Claudy, and J. Uitto, submitted for publication. The patients had a progressive bullous eruption, covering over 70% of the skin surface. The patients developed uremia during the course of disease, and urinalysis revealed 3+/4+ protein and 1+/2+ blood; the urine sediment for both patients contained dysmorphic red cells and granular casts. Skin biopsy revealed a subepidermal blister with marked eosinophilic infiltrates. In addition to the patients' serum samples, sera from the following patients were used in the present study: (i) patients with Goodpasture syndrome with IgG autoantibodies directed against the α3 chain of type IV collagen; (ii) two patients with X-linked Alport syndrome transplanted with normal kidney with circulating antibodies to the α5(IV); (iii) two cases of EBA with circulating antibodies to the 290-kDa antigen; (iv) two pemphigoid gestationis patients with circulating antibodies to the 180-kDa BPAg2; (v) two cases of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LAD); (vi) four pemphigus vulgaris patients with circulating antibodies to the 130-kDa desmoglein-3; (vii) a patient with IgG antibodies to the 168-kDa epithelial antigen and (viii) eight unrelated healthy individuals. The monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies used in this study were as follows: (i) a rabbit polyclonal antibody to type IV collagen purified from human placenta (Institut Pasteur de Lyon, Lyon, France); (ii) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the α1, α3, and α5 chain of type IV collagen (Wiselab, Lund, Sweden); (iii) a mouse mAb to type IV collagen (Dako SA, Trappes, France); (iv) a mouse mAb to type VII collagen (Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom); (v) a human mAb to the 230-kDa BP antigen (BPAg1) (7.Peyron E. Nicolas J.F. Reano A. Roche P. Thivolet J. Haftek M. Schmitt D. Peronne C. Banchereau J. Rousset F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1333-1339PubMed Google Scholar); (vi) a guinea pig polyclonal antibody to rBP55, a BPAg1 recombinant protein (8.Gaucherand M. Nicolas J. Baccala G.P. Rouault J. Reano A. Magaud J. Thivolet J. Jolivet M. Schmitt D. Br. J. Dermatol. 1995; 132: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); and (vii) a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the immunodominant epitopes of the BPAg2 ectodomain (R67) (9.Ghohestani R.F. Cozzani E. Delaporte E. Nicolas J. Parodi A. Claudy A. J. Clin. Immunol. 1998; 18: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (the last three items were produced in our laboratory). Secondary antibodies included fluorescein or rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit antibodies to either human IgG, human IgA, or human IgM (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); a monoclonal mouse anti-human IgE (Advanced Immuno Chemical, Long Beach, CA); a biotinylated goat anti-human and anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase-conjugated anti-human and anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); a biotinylated anti-rabbit/guinea pig IgG (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Circulating anti-BMZ antibodies were detected by IF performed on 4-μm cryostat sections of the following tissue substrates: normal human skin, normal human salt-split skin (see below), normal human kidney, and skin and kidney from a patient with X-linked Alport syndrome characterized by the absence of the α5(IV) chain. The dermal-epidermal junction was separated by 1 m NaCl containing 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 m EDTA (10.Ghohestani R. Kanitakis J. Nicolas J. Cozzani E. Claudy A. Br. J. Dermatol. 1996; 135: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To define further the antigens targeted by the patients' autoantibodies, the sera were tested against several different BMZ protein extracts or purified proteins. Two different protocols were used for extraction of skin antigens, as described previously (11.Ghohestani R.F. Nicolas J. Kanitakis J. Claudy A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 854-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Epidermal proteins were obtained from normal human keratinocytes in culture, and dermal proteins were extracted from human dermis after removing the epidermis. In order to evaluate the immunoreactivity of the patients' sera against the tissue-specific chains of type IV collagen, we produced fusion proteins corresponding to the NC1 domains of the α1(IV)–α6(IV) chains. These fusion proteins contain a Flag sequence (Kodak IBI Systems, New Haven, CT). The expression vectors for the α3(IV)NC1, α4(IV)NC1, and α5(IV)NC1 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the genes from plasmids pDSα3, MM19-14, and MD-6 (12.Sado Y. Boutaud A. Kagawa M. Naito I. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 664-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The construction of the expression vectors for α1(IV)NC1, α2(IV)NC1, and α6(IV)NC1 was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the genes from a commercially available cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. The following primers were used: 5′-GCT AGC ATC TGT TGA TCA CGG CTT CC-3′ and 5′-CCG CGG TAG CTG AGT CAG GCT TCA TTA TG-3′ for α1(IV)NC1; 5′-GCT AGC CGT CAG CAT CGG CTA CCT CC-3′ and 5′-GGG CCC TGG CAC GCG CCG GCT CAC AGG-3′ for α2(IV)NC1; 5′-GAT ATG CTA GCC GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAA CGT GGA GAC-3′ and 5′TAC ATA GGG CCC TCA GTG TCT TTT CTT CAT GCA C3′ for α3(IV)NC1; 5′-ATA ATG CTA GCC GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG CCT GGA TAC CTC GGT GGC TTC C3′ and 5′-GCC GAG GGC CCC TAG CTA TAC TTC ACG CAG-3′ for α4(IV)NC1; 5′-T GGT CCG CTA GCT GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAA GGT CCC CCT GG-3′ and 5′-TAG AAT AGG GCC CTC TAG ATG CAT GCT CGA-3′ for α5(IV)NC1; and 5′-GCT AGC GACG CAT GAG AGT GGG CTA CAC G-3′ and 5′-GGG CCC GTG GCA GGT GCC ACC CTA CAG GC-3′ for α6(IV)NC1. The secreted proteins carried the Flag sequence fused to the amino terminus of the respective full-length NC1 domain. The proteins were purified by a single affinity chromatographic step using anti-Flag agarose columns. To evaluate whether the patients' sera contain antibodies reactive with the other previously identified skin antigens, we used a fusion protein that harbors the carboxyl-terminal part of the BPAg1 (rBP55), a peptide (RG14) that corresponds to the NC16a domain of BPAg2 (type XVII collagen) (RSILPYGDSMDRIE), and a purified form of laminin-5. rBP55 and RG14 contain the major antigenic epitopes for antibodies to BPAg1 and BPAg2, respectively (9.Ghohestani R.F. Cozzani E. Delaporte E. Nicolas J. Parodi A. Claudy A. J. Clin. Immunol. 1998; 18: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 was purified by affinity chromatography from culture media of squamous carcinoma cells (SCC25 cells) (13.Ghohestani R.F. Nicolas J.F. Rousselle P. Claudy A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 136-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium (500 ml) was passed sequentially over 25 ml of gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 10 ml of BM165-Sepharose (G1 fraction of monoclonal Ab to BM165) equilibrated in PBS. Material bound to BM165-Sepharose was eluted using 1m acetic acid. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–22% acrylamide gradient gel) under reducing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the sera, as described elsewhere (13.Ghohestani R.F. Nicolas J.F. Rousselle P. Claudy A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 136-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The protein bands transferred onto nitrocellulose paper were used as immunoaffinity substrates to purify antibodies directed against the protein of interest, as described (13.Ghohestani R.F. Nicolas J.F. Rousselle P. Claudy A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 136-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After transferring the protein extracts onto a nitrocellulose membrane, vertical lanes from both sides of the membrane were cut and immunochemically stained with the serum to identify the band of interest (185 kDa). Horizontal strips of nitrocellulose containing the antigen were then cut, and the serum was applied as a 1:5 dilution in PBS for 2 h. After washing in PBS-Tween 20, the antibodies were eluted with 20 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.2), 0.04% Tween 20 for 3 min at 37 °C, and immediately neutralized with 2 mTris-HCl (pH 7.5). The solution was dialyzed against the buffer, concentrated, and used for immunofluorescence studies. To evaluate possible reactivity of the patients' antibodies to α1(IV)–α6(IV), BPAg1, or BPAg2, we performed an ELISA. We used recombinant proteins corresponding to α1(IV)–α6(IV) NC1, rBP55, and RG14. Microtiter plates (96-well) were coated with the proteins at a concentration of 1.5 μg/ml in PBS buffer, overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with PBS-Tween 20 (1%) and then incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Before application to the plate, the sera were incubated, at 4 °C, with Flag peptide (final concentration, 5 μg/ml) in order to block any potential cross-reactivity with anti-Flag antibodies. Coated wells were subsequently incubated with antibodies (dilution 1:100) and patients' sera (dilution 1:20) for 1 h, washed, and incubated for 45 min with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human or anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:1000 in PBS. The plates were then washed, and phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was added and allowed to react for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. IF microscopy of the patients' perilesional skin revealed linear IgG and C3 deposits along the dermal-epidermal junction in a pattern similar to that obtained from the patients' circulating antibodies with the BMZ of normal human skin (data not shown). Autoantibodies were mainly directed against epitopes residing on the dermal side as revealed by examination of lesional and normal skin treated by 1 m NaCl (Fig.2). Immunoglobulin class analysis showed that the anti-BMZ antibodies from the patients' sera contained IgG but lacked IgA, IgM, or IgE. Because the patients developed nephropathy during the course of their disease, we sought to determine whether the patients' autoantibodies recognize any component of renal glomerular basement membrane. Interestingly, the patients' sera reacted with normal kidney sections and stained the basement membranes of glomerulus (Fig.3). This is in contrast to autoantibodies from other blistering diseases including EBA and BP that fail to react with glomerular basement membrane. Immunoblots of the patients' sera on dermal extracts revealed a band of 185 kDa (Fig.4 B). This reactivity could be abolished by preincubation of the serum with recombinant α5(IV)NC1 domain of type IV collagen. The specific immunoreactivity of the patients' sera against the α5(IV) NC1 domain was further confirmed by immunoblot assay (Fig. 4 C). The anti-α5(IV) alloantibodies clearly reacted with the recombinant α5(IV) NC1 recombinant protein. IgG antibodies eluted from the 185-kDa band further bound the skin and renal BMZ by IF microscopy. These findings confirmed that the IgG autoantibodies that recognize the 185-kDa antigen are indeed antibodies directed against a BMZ component. The patients' sera did not show any reactivity with either the 230- or the 180-kDa BP antigens (Fig. 4 A) by immunoblot assay or rBP55 and RG14 by ELISA. There was no IgG reactivity against the type VII collagen (EBA antigen), the 168-kDa cicatricial pemphigoid antigen, or the laminin-5 subunits using the patients' sera by immunoblot assay. By ELISA, autoantibodies from the patient 1 reacted specifically with α5(IV) NC1 domain with an absorbance value of 1.2 (Fig.5). The absorbance value was down to 0.2 using a serum sample that was obtained after therapeutical control of blister formation. No specific reactivity was observed with the α1(IV)–α4(IV)NC1 or α6(IV)NC1 domains by either ELISA (values less than 0.3) or immunoblot assay. Control sera from normal individuals or patients with BP or EBA did not react with the α1-α6(IV) NC1 domains by ELISA (values less than 0.3) or by immunoblot assay. X-linked Alport syndrome is a hereditary renal disease with mutations in genes encoding the α5(IV) collagen chain (5.Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The skin and glomerulus of the Alport patient are deficient in the α5(IV) collagen chain. We examined by IF the skin (Fig.6, A–C) and glomerulus (Fig.6, D–F) using the circulating antibodies from the patients in the present study. The patients' sera did not stain the skin (Fig.6 B) or the glomerular basement membrane (Fig. 6 E) from the Alport patient. The absence of the α5(IV) chain in the Alport skin (Fig. 6 C) and glomerulus (Fig. 6 F) was verified by the absence of reactivity with the α5(IV)NC1 monoclonal antibody. Alport tissues strongly reacted with anti α1(IV) collagen antibody (Fig. 6, A and D). We stained the patients' lesional skin with mAb to α5(IV) in order to evaluate the expression pattern of α5(IV) as compared with normal human skin (Fig.7). Anti-α5(IV) revealed a continuous linear staining along the dermal-epidermal junction of a normal skin section (Fig. 7 B). This pattern was quite different from that observed in the patients' lesional skin, in which a discontinuous expression of α5(IV) was detected along the dermal-epidermal junction using an anti-α5(IV) mAb (Fig. 7 A). This finding confirmed that the α5(IV) collagen chain is the target antigen within the lesional tissue. In this study, we report, for the first time, the identification of the α5(IV) chain of type IV collagen as the target antigen in a novel autoimmune disease, characterized by sudden onset of extensive bullous eruptions of skin accompanied by mucosal lesions and nephropathy. The identity of the target antigen was established by immunochemical analyses of several candidate components. The patients' antibodies reacted with a 185-kDa protein that was distinguished from the 230-kDa (14.Stanley J.R. Hawley-Nelson P. Yuspa S.H. Shevach E.M. Katz S.I. Cell. 1981; 24 (803): 897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) or the 180-kDa (4.Diaz L. Ratrie 3., H. Saunders W. Futamura S. Squiquera H. Anhalt G. Giudice G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) BP antigens, the type VII collagen EBA antigen (3.Woodley D. Briggaman R. O'Keefe E. Inman A. Queen L. Gammon W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), the 168-kDa cicatricial pemphigoid antigen (13.Ghohestani R.F. Nicolas J.F. Rousselle P. Claudy A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 136-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or the α3, β3, and γ2 chains of laminin 5 (15.Domloge-Hultsch N. Gammon W. Briggaman R. Gil S. Carter W. Yancey K. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1628-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16.Ghohestani R.F. Nicolas J.F. Rousselle P. Claudy A. Arch.

A. 1996; 93: 14714-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Antibodies eluted from the 185-kDa protein, fractionated by electrophoresis, and reacted with the epithelial and renal basement membrane in a fashion analogous to that of whole serum. Preincubation of the patients' sera with the α5(IV)NC1 domain of type IV collagen abolished the reactivity of the 185-kDa antigen. Furthermore, the sera specifically reacted with the α5(IV)NC1 domain, among the six NC1 domains, by Western blot and ELISA analysis. Targeting the α5(IV) chain was also confirmed at the tissue level, at which an altered expression of α5(IV) had been demonstrated at the lesional skin. These data clearly established the α5(IV) collagen chain as the target autoantigen in our cases. The specific α5(IV) chain reactivity of the autoantibodies was determined on Alport's renal and skin samples by IF microscopy. Whereas the patients' autoantibodies stained the skin and glomerulus from a normal individual, they did not react with the skin and glomerulus from an Alport patient, which are devoid of the α5(IV) chain (Fig. 6). Collectively, these data are consistent with the identity of the α5(IV) chain as the target autoantigen. This unique autoimmune disease represents the second primary human disease in which one of the type IV collagen α chains serves as the target antigen (Fig. 1). In Goodpasture syndrome, in which α3(IV) chain is the target of IgG autoantibodies, no skin lesions develop because the α3(IV) chain is not present in skin BMZ (18.Gubler M. Knebelmann B. Beziau A. Broyer M. Pirson Y. Haddoum F. Kleppel M. Antignac C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as was clearly shown by ELISA, Goodpasture's sera are specific for the α3(IV) NC1, whereas our patients' sera do not react with this molecule. Antibodies to α5(IV) chain have been recently identified in few transplanted Alport patients receiving a kidney that normally expresses α5(IV) chain (19.Dehan P. Heuvel L.V.D. Smeets H. Tryggvason K. Foidart J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1996; 11: 1983-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Their skin BMZ does not, however, express α5(IV), and consequently, no blistering can be seen. However, presence of alloantibodies in these cases attests to immunogenicity of α5(IV) chain and provides evidence for the presence of autoreactive T cells against this molecule. Erythematous base of the cutaneous lesions as well as marked eosinophil cell infiltrates observed in the lesional biopsy from our cases led us to postulate that these cells play an important role in skin BMZ disruption, as has been already suggested for BP. Eosinophils could play a crucial role in the dermal-epidermal separation through the release of their enzymatic mediators (20.Stahle-Backdahl M. Inoue M. Guidice G.J. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2022-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this could explain why in patients with the X-linked Alport syndrome with mutations in the α5(IV) collagen gene no major skin lesions have been reported. Absence of α5(IV) and α6(IV) could be largely compensated by the classic type IV collagen molecule, (α1(IV))2α2(IV), stabilizing the skin BMZ. However, presence of autoantibodies against these proteins could lead to disruption of skin BMZ mainly through cell infiltrates, followed by release and activation of proteases. Nevertheless, a recent report indicating the presence of recurrent epithelial erosions in patients with X-linked Alport syndrome (21.Rhys C. Snyers B. Pirson Y. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 208-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) further confirms our current suggestion regarding an important role of α5(IV) in epithelial BMZ integrity. Because the patients' IgG anti-α5(IV) antibodies stain the floor of blister, we hypothesize that the dermal-epidermal dissociation may be the result of loss of interaction of α5(IV) with the molecules that act as bridges between the plasma membrane and the underlying molecules of the extracellular matrices such as laminins. Laminins are known to interact with type IV collagen through the nidogen. Further investigation is, however, necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Interestingly, the association of subepidermal blistering and glomerular nephropathy has previously been described (21.Rhys C. Snyers B. Pirson Y. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 208-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22.Ross J.B. Cohen A.D. Ghose T. Arch. Dermatol. 1985; 121: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Most of these cases had IgG deposits in both the skin and glomerular BMZ. However, the antigenic specificity of the patients' autoantibodies was not determined. Some of these patients were diagnosed as having an extension of Goodpasture syndrome with skin involvement (23.Ross E.A. Ahmed A.R. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1989; 14: 225-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, in Goodpasture syndrome, there are no IgG deposits along the skin BMZ because the autoantigen is not present in the skin BMZ (18.Gubler M. Knebelmann B. Beziau A. Broyer M. Pirson Y. Haddoum F. Kleppel M. Antignac C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because these patients had circulating antibodies reactive with both the skin and the kidney BMZ, their specific anti-α5(IV) reactivity merits testing. We thank Drs. M. C. Gubler and C.

The lack of therapy for DEB provides an impetus to develop gene therapy strategies. However, the full-length 9-kilobase type VII collagen cDNA exceeds the cloning capacity of current viral delivery vectors. In this study, we produced a recombinant type VII minicollagen containing the intact noncollagenous domains, NC1 and NC2, and part of the central collagenous domain using stably transfected human 293 cell clones and purified large quantities of the recombinant minicollagen VII from culture media. Minicollagen VII was secreted as correctly-folded, disulfide-bonded, helical trimers resistant to protease degradation. Purified minicollagen VII bound to fibronectin, laminin-5, type I collagen, and type IV collagen. Furthermore, retroviral-mediated transduction of the minigene construct into DEB keratinocytes (in which type VII collagen was absent) resulted in persistent synthesis and secretion of a 230-kDa recombinant minicollagen VII. In comparison with parent DEB keratinocytes, the gene-corrected DEB keratinocytes demonstrated enhanced cell-substratum adhesion, increased proliferative potential, and reduced cell motility, features that reversed the DEB phenotype toward normal. We conclude that the use of the minicollagen VII may provide a strategy to correct the cellular manifestations of gene defects in DEB.

The pathogenesis of DEB involves a basement membrane zone (BMZ)-specific collagen called type VII collagen, the major component of structures within the BMZ called anchoring fibrils. DEB patients have defects in the gene, designated COL7A1, that encodes for type VII (anchoring fibril) collagen (2Uitto J. Christiano A.M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 287: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The BMZ of patients with DEB is characterized by a paucity or diminutive size of anchoring fibrils (3Briggaman R.A. Wheeler Jr., C.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1975; 65: 71-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Earlier genetic linkage studies identified the human COL7A1 as the gene responsible for DEB (2Uitto J.

Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 287: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Type VII collagen is composed of three identical α chains, each consisting of a 145-kDa central collagenous triple-helical segment characterized by repeating Gly-X-Y amino acid sequences, flanked by a large 145-kDa amino-terminal, noncollagenous domain (NC1), and a small 34-kDa carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous domain (NC2) (7Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Within the extracellular space, type VII collagen molecules form antiparallel, tail-to-tail dimers stabilized by disulfide bonding through a small carboxyl-terminal NC2 overlap between two type VII collagen molecules. A portion of the NC2 domain is then proteolytically removed (9Bruckner-Tuderman L. Nilssen O. Zimmermann D.R. Dours- Zimmermann M.T. Kalinke D.U. Gedde-Dahl Jr., T. Winberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The antiparallel dimers then aggregate laterally to form anchoring fibrils with large globular NC1 domains at both ends of the structure. NC1 domains have been suggested to interact at one end with BMZ components, and at the other ends with type IV collagen in “anchoring plaques” (7Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the NC1 domain revealed the presence of multiple submodules with homology to adhesive proteins (10Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 26: 20256-20262Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). These include a segment with homology to cartilage matrix protein, nine consecutive fibronectin type III-like repeats, and a segment with homology to the A domain of von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the NC1 domain may facilitate binding of type VII collagen to other BMZ and matrix components. These matrix interactions are thought to stabilize the adhesion of the BMZ to the underlying dermis. Our recent study using recombinant NC1 demonstrated that NC1 interacts with various extracellular matrix (ECM) components including fibronectin, laminin 5, type I collagen, and type IV collagen (11Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. O'Toole E.A. Rao C.N. Cai X.-Y. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, structural alterations in type VII collagen may result in functional disruption of its interactions with ECM components, leading to the epidermal-dermal disadherance seen in DEB. Type VII collagen cDNA has been isolated. The full-length cDNA sequence contains 8,833 nucleotides encoding 2,944 amino acids (10Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 26: 20256-20262Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar,12Parente M.G. Chung L.C. Ryynanen J. Woodley D.T. Wynn K.C. Bauer E.A. Mattei M-G. Chu M-L. Uitto J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6931-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cloning of type VII collagen facilitated the molecular analysis of mutations underlying DEB (2Uitto J. Christiano A.M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 287: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The identification of specific mutations in different parts of COL7A1 has enhanced the understanding of the structural and functional roles of various type VII collagen domains. Over 100 distinct mutations in COL7A1 have been identified, and these mutations have occurred within NC1, NC2, and the helical domain (13Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Curr. Opin. Dermatol. 1996; 3: 225-232Google Scholar,14Uitto J. Hovnanian A. Christiano A.M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1995; 107: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). The most severe form of DEB is recessive dystrophic EB (the Hallopeau-Siemens type, HS-RDEB), characterized by mutilating scarring of the hands and feet, joint contractures, strictures of the esophagus, and the development of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas in affected areas of the skin. These skin cancers frequently shorten the life of patients to two or three decades. In the most severe clinical subtype of recessive DEB (RDEB), the COL7A1 mutations involve the creation of premature termination codons which predict the synthesis of a very truncated type VII collagen (15Christiano A.M. Anhalt G. Gibbons S. Bauer E.A. Uitto J. Genomics. 1994; 21: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The main effect of any premature termination codon, however, is to create an unstable mRNA transcript and, consequently, little if any functional protein is generated from the mutant allele. In the homozygous or compound heterozygous state, these mutations result in the absence of anchoring fibrils. Identification of mutations in COL7A1 provides the foundation for the development of gene therapy strategies for DEB. Gene therapy for heritable diseases through genetic engineering holds considerable promise, particularly for diseases where no effective treatment is currently available. The potential use of gene transfer is particularly well suited to RDEB patients who carry null alleles which are not expressed, leading to the absence of type VII collagen production and the absence of anchoring fibrils. Retroviral vectors are the most utilized vehicles in human gene therapy trials because of their capacity for high efficiency transduction and stable gene transfer (16Morgan R.A. Anderson W.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 191-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Retroviral vectors, however, have insert size limitations of 7–8 kilobases and therefore cannot accommodate the entire 9-kilobase type VII collagen cDNA (17Anderson W.F. Nature. 1998; 392: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In order to use highly efficient retroviral vectors, we selectively deleted regions of the type VII collagen cDNA to produce a truncated type VII collagen minigene construct. Our hypothesis was that a smaller version of the type VII collagen α chain created by deletion of selected helical segments that are not functionally critical could still form functional anchoring fibrils. This approach has been used successfully in the development of gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (18Paula R. Clements C. Caskey T. Eur. Neurol. 1994; 34: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used an efficient eukaryotic expression system to obtain large quantities of recombinant minicollagen VII in conditioned medium from human kidney 293 cells. Functional analyses showed that the minigene product, a truncated type VII collagen α chain, retained the function and characteristics of a full-length type VII collagen α chain. In addition, our data demonstrated that the expression of minicollagen VII in RDEB keratinocytes (in which type VII collagen was absent) induced reversion of the RDEB cellular phenotype. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary and immortalized RDEB keratinocytes (gift of Dr. Scott Herron, Stanford University) were cultured in low calcium, serum-free keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor (SFM; Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as described by Boyce and Ham (19Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81 (suppl.): 33S-44SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (960) Google Scholar) and modified by O'Keefe and Chiu (20O'Keefe E.J. Chiu M.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 2-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RDEB keratinocytes were immortalized using theE6 and E7 genes of human papillomavirus type 6 as described (21Halbert C.L. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1990; 66: 2125-2134Crossref Google Scholar). Patients with RDEB (defined by clinical, immunohistological, and ultrastructural criteria) were selected from the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry site of Stanford University. The eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) which contains a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and enhancer was used to express the truncated human type VII collagen minigene (Fig. 1). The cDNA comprised the sequences coding for the NH2-terminal 1253 amino acids of the noncollagenous NC1 domain, 880 amino acids of the central collagenous helical domain, and 161 amino acids of the COOH-terminal NC2 domain. The construct has a 683-amino acids in-frame deletion from amino acids 1920 to 2603 within the central collagenous domain. The truncated human type VII cDNA was assembled from CMV/NC1 and three cDNA clones previously described (11Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. O'Toole E.A. Rao C.N. Cai X.-Y. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) by standard subcloning techniques and recombinant PCR. The construct utilized the overlapping internal restriction sites including BamHI, XhoI, and SacII from each cDNA fragment. The correct ligation and in-frame insertion of various DNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The expression vector was used to transfect the human embryonal kidney cell line 293 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and immortalized RDEB keratinocytes using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as described previously (11Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. O'Toole E.A. Rao C.N. Cai X.-Y. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Stable clones were selected using 500 μg of G418/ml (11Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. O'Toole E.A. Rao C.N. Cai X.-Y. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mini-type VII collagen cDNA was subcloned into a MFG-based LZRS vector and high titer virus-producing cells were generated from human BING 293 packing cells by transfection with calcium-phosphate co-precipitation followed by selection in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin as described (22Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Human Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Cells were shifted to serum-free medium for 24 h and retroviral supernatants were collected (22Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Human Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). For retroviral infection, keratinocyte cultures were trypsinized and seeded onto 100-mm plates and incubated for 24 h. Viral supernatant (2.5 ml) was diluted to 50% with SFM (2.5 ml) and supplemented with 5 μg/ml Polybrene and added to keratinocyte cultures which were 40–60% confluent. Plates were then incubated in a 37 °C incubator. After 6 h, 5 ml more of SFM was added, and plates were incubated for additional 16 h at 37 °C, after which the medium was changed with 8 ml of fresh SFM. For immunoblot analysis, clonal cell lines resistant to G418 were grown to confluence, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cultures were maintained for an additional 24 h. The media were collected, equilibrated to 5 mm EDTA, 50 μm N-ethylmaleimide, and 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and concentrated 10–15-fold (Centricon-100, Amicon, Beverly, MA) and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The presence of recombinant minicollagen VII was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody, LH7.2 (Sigma), and polyclonal antibodies to the NC1 and NC2 domains of type VII collagen, respectively (23Chen M. Petersen M.J. Li H.-L. Cai X.-Y. O'Toole E.A. Woodley D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 125-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For large-scale purification of recombinant minicollagen VII, serum-free media were equilibrated to 5 mm EDTA, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μm N-ethylmaleimide and precipitated with 300 mg/ml ammonium sulfate at 4 °C overnight with stirring (24Lunstrum G.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9042-9048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifuging at 1.2 × 106 g/min for 1 h, resuspended and dialyzed in Buffer A (65 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). Following dialysis, insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 8,600 × gfor 20 min, and the pellet redissolved in Buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The solution was clarified as above, and the supernatant, S1, stored at −20 °C. The pellet redissolved in Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl, 2 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethyl-maleimide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The solution was clarified as above and the supernatant containing purified minicollagen VII, S2, stored at −20 °C. Binding of soluble minicollagen VII and NC1 to immobilized ligands followed by a colorimetric enzyme-linked antibody reaction was performed as described previously (11Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. O'Toole E.A. Rao C.N. Cai X.-Y. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, multiwell plates (96 wells, Dynatch Laboratory Inc., Alexandria, VA) were coated overnight with ECM proteins (2 μg) in 100 mmcarbonate buffer, pH 9.3. The wells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Coated wells were subsequently incubated with 2 μg of purified recombinant minicollagen VII or NC1 overnight at 4 °C. The binding of minicollagen VII to ECM proteins was detected using an affinity-purified anti-NC1 antibody at a dilution of 1:500 followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400) (Organon Teknika-Cappel, Durham, NC). The development of a colorimetric reaction using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY) was measured by spectrophotemetry at 405 nm (Labsystems Multiskan Multisoft, Finland). The ligands used for binding included purified type I and type IV collagens (Collaborative Biomedical Product, Bedford, MA). Laminin 1 was routinely prepared from the EHS tumor as described (25Woodley D.T. Rao C.N. Hassell J.R. Liotta L.A. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fibronectin was prepared from human plasma as described previously (26O'Keefe E.J. Woodley D.T. Castillo G. Russel N. Payne Jr., R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1984; 82: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Laminin 5 was the generous gift of Dr. Peter Marinkovich, Stanford University. Human laminin 5 was purified from collagenase-solubilized human amniotic membranes by antibody affinity chromatography using monoclonal antibody K140-Sepharose as described (27Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant minicollagen was incubated with chymotrypsin (Sigma) at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:10 by weight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl or with pepsin in 0.1 m acetic acid at 37 °C for 2 h and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with a polyclonal antibody against the collagenous domain of type VII collagen. Keratinocyte migration was assayed by the method of Albrecht-Buehler (28Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), as modified by Woodley et al. (29Woodley D.T. Bachmann P.M. O'Keefe E.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, colloidal gold salts were immobilized on coverslips and covered with type I collagen (15 μg/ml). Keratinocyte cultures were suspended, plated on the coverslips, and allowed to migrate for 16–20 h. The cells were fixed in 0.1% formaladehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and examined under dark field optics with a video camera attached to a computer equipped with a frame grabber. The computer analyzes 15 nonoverlapping fields in each experimental condition with NIH Image 1.6 and determines the percentage area of each field consumed by cell migration tracks, a so called Migration Index. Confirmation of a difference in migration as statistically significant requires rejection of the null hypothesis of no difference between mean migration indices obtained from replicate sets at the p= 0.05 level with a Student's t test. Cell migration was also assessed in an in vitro scratch assay as described by Cha et al. (30Cha D. O'Brien E.A. O'Toole E.A. Woodley D.T. Hudson L.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 590-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayer cultures of keratinocytes were scratched in a standardized manner with a plastic instrument to create a 2-mm wide cell-free zone in each culture. The medium was then aspirated and replaced with fresh SFM containing type I collagen (15 μg/ml). The keratinocytes from the cut edge of the scratch were then allowed to migrate for 16 h and photographed. To measure cell-substrate adhesion, a standardized cell adhesion assay according to Varani et al.(31Varani J. Nickoloff B.J. Dixit V.M. Mitra R.S. Voorhees J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, keratinocytes grown in 60-mm dishes were washed two times and treated with 0.05% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA, 37 °C. At various times, detached cells were gently harvested and counted. A total cell count was made when all of the cells had been released, and the percentage of cells released at each time point was determined. Keratinocyte proliferation was measured by seeding 35-mm (diameter) culture dishes with 7.5 × 104 cells per dishes in keratinocyte growth medium (SFM). The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2for 1 to 6 days. After the incubation, the cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and counted with hemocytometer. We constructed a type VII collagen “minigene” as diagrammed schematically in Fig. 1, comprising the sequences coding for the NH2-terminal 1253 amino acids and the COOH-terminal 161 amino acids of the noncollagenous domains (NC1 and NC2, respectively) and 880 amino acids of the central collagenous domains minus a 683-amino acids in-frame deletion (deletion from amino acids 1920 to 2603). The cDNA construct was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV and used to transfect human 293 cells. The minigene expression was initially examined by transient transfection of human 293 embronic kidney cells. Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against the NC1 and NC2 domains of type VII collagen detected the expression of a 230-kDa doublet recombinant proteins in serum-free medium (Fig. 2,lane 2 and lane 4). These proteins were absent in the control vector-transfected 293 cells (Fig. 2, lane 1 andlane 3). Triple helical assembly of collagens often requires hydroxylation and the presence of ascorbic acid. As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of ascorbic acid, the minicollagen VII was secreted as a 230-kDa monomer (lane 5) under nonreducing conditions, while in the presence of ascorbic acid, it was secreted as a 700-kDa protein, corresponding to the association of three minicollagen VII monomers (lane 6). The recombinant minicollagen VII was purified from serum-free culture medium of stably transfected 293 cells which contained 2–5 μg/ml minicollagen. In the serum-free culture medium, the recombinant product could be easily identified as a 230-kDa doublet that was absent in the parental 293 cells (Fig.3 A, compare lane 1 and 2). The ammonium sulfate precipitate of the conditioned medium proteins was sequentially solubilized with salt and urea and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). When the purified minicollagen VII was subjected to 4–20% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing condition (Fig. 3 B), it migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 700 kDa, the expected size of a trimer. Under reducing conditions, however, all the trimers converted into monomers. The demonstration that minicollagen apparently assembled to form S–S bonded trimers suggests, but does not prove, that these composites are stable and have a proper triple helical conformation in their collagenous domain. To examine this question further, purified minicollagen VII was treated with chymotrypsin and pepsin and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against the triple helical domain. As shown in Fig.4, digestion of the 230-kDa minicollagen VII with two enzymes produced a 115-kDa protease-resistant fragment under reducing conditions (Fig. 4, lane 2 and lane 3). Under nonreducing conditions, the 700-kDa trimer disappeared to give rise to a 350-kDa fragment (lane 5 and lane 6), the expected molecular mass of the disulfide-bonded collagenous domain. The resistance to protease digestion demonstrates the triple helical conformation of the minicollagen VII (32Bruckner P. Prockop D. J. Anal Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the NC1 domain of type VII collagen interacts with fibronectin, laminin 5, type I collagen, and type IV collagen. Therefore, we examined the ability of purified minicollagen VII to bind immobilized ECM components. In order to compare the binding affinity between NC1 and minicollagen VII, purified recombinant NC1 was also included in the binding assay. As shown in Fig.5, like NC1, minicollagen VII binds to fibronectin, laminin 5, type I collagen, and type IV collagen. Little or no binding occurred with laminin-1. The ECM binding affinities appeared the same when NC1 and minicollagen VII were compared with the exception of the affinity for fibronectin. In this case, minicollagen VII appears to bind more avidly than NC1. This is consistent with our previous study that mapped a second fibronectin-binding site within the collagenous domain (33Lapiere J.C. Chen J.D. Iwasaki T. Hu L.-R. Uitto J. Woodley D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 94: 637-641Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To examine if the genetic defect of RDEB keratinocytes could be corrected by minicollagen VII expression, the minigene cDNA construct was introduced into RDEB keratinocytes by retroviral-mediated gene transfer using an amphotropic retroviral expression vector (22Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Human Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). This vector was used to transduce keratinocytes immortalized from two RDEB patients. The patients in this study lacked type VII collagen expression, but expressed other BMZ proteins, including BP230, BP180, type IV collagen, and laminin 5 (data not shown). Western analysis of the secreted proteins detected the expression of 290-kDa type VII collagen in the medium of normal keratinocytes (Fig.6 A, lane 1). This band was completely absent in the RDEB keratinocytes (Fig.6 A, lane 2). Transduction of minigene construct into RDEB keratinocytes resulted in the expression of a 230-kDa minicollagen VII (lane 4) while this band was completely absent in the control virus-transduced cells (lane 3). Similar results were obtained with keratinocyte from the other patient. The expression of minicollagen VII was sustained at least 8 monthsin vitro (Fig. 6 B). We previously observed that cultured RDEB keratinocytes display a different morphology than normal keratinocytes. Compared with normal human keratinocytes, RDEB keratinocytes show decreased cell-substrate adhesion, a decreased proliferative potential and hypermotility on collagen matrices. To determine if minigene transfer exerts any functional effects on RDEB cells, we first assessed motility by thein vitro scratch assay. In this assay, the keratinocytes were plated densely in tissue culture wells and after 24 h a standardized scratch was made through confluent monolayers of cultured keratinocytes. The keratinocytes from the cut edge of the scratch were then allowed to migrate for 16 h and photographed. As shown in Fig. 7 A, RDEB keratinocytes were found to migrate into the scratch much more rapidly than normal keratinocytes (compare panel RDEB to panel NHK). Thus, RDEB keratinocytes display hypermotility. Compared with parental RDEB or control virus transduced RDEB keratinocytes, minigene transduced RDEB keratinocytes demonstrated reduced motility (compare panel RDEB/C7M to panel RDEB andRDEB/LZR), that was similar to the motility of normal keratinocytes. No appreciable difference in cell motility was noted between RDEB ke"
https://openalex.org/W2046971908,"SOX proteins belong to a multigenic family characterized by a unique DNA binding domain, known as the high mobility group box, that is related to that of the testis determining gene SRY. cDNA sequences for more than 30SOX genes have been identified, and some are known to have diverse roles in vertebrate differentiation and development. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of mouse Sox15that was uncovered during a screen for high mobility group box containing transcription factors that are expressed at different levels during skeletal muscle differentiation. Sox15 cDNAs were found at a much higher frequency in myoblasts prior to their differentiation into myotubes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that recombinant SOX15 protein was capable of binding to a consensus DNA binding site for SOX proteins. When overexpressed in C2C12 myoblasts, wild type SOX15, but not a C-terminal truncated form or the related protein SOX11, specifically inhibited activation of muscle-specific genes and expression of the basic helix-loop-helix myogenic factors myogenin and MyoD, resulting in a failure of the cells to differentiate into myotubes. These results suggest a specific and repressive role for SOX15, requiring the C-terminal domain, during myogenesis.

Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Genes that encode proteins with more than 50% amino acid similarity with the SRY HMG box have been identified and classified as SOX genes (SRY box). SOX genes were first described in mammals but have now been isolated from many phyla, including insects, fish, amphibians, and birds (2.Soullier S. Jay P. Poulat F. Vanacker J.M. Berta P. Laudet V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SOXgenes belong to a multigenic family classified into seven groups according to their amino acid sequence and genomic organization (for a review, see Ref. 3.Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). SOX proteins can act as transcription factors and architectural components of chromatin. They bind in vitro to the same DNA consensus sequence as SRY ((A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G) (4.Haqq C.M. King C.Y. Ukiyama E. Falsafi S. Haqq T.N. Donahoe P.K.

The majority of SOX cDNAs have been isolated using degenerate PCR primers specific for the DNA binding HMG domain and, as a result, exist only as incomplete forms. Consequently, relatively few full-lengthSOX cDNA sequences are available, but those that have been further characterized play critical roles in the regulation of fundamental developmental processes, and mutations in someSOX genes are associated with human diseases. SOX1, SOX2, and SOX3 are involved in the development of the central nervous system in chicken and regulate δ-cristallin gene expression in the eye (6.Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Collignon J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). SOX4 has been shown to regulate thymocyte and lymphocyte differentiation (8.Schilham M.W. Moerer P. Cumano A. Clevers H.C.

SOX9 was identified by positional cloning and is associated with the skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia, in which two-thirds of XY individuals show sex reversal (10.Wagner T.

SOX9 is expressed very early in the genital ridge and is involved in sex determination and testis development. More recently, SOX9 has been identified as the first transcription factor essential for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation in mouse (13.Bi W. Deng J. Zhang Z. Behringer R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar) and chick embryos (14.Healy C. Uwanogho D. Sharpe P. Dev.

Although SOX genes are known to play fundamental roles in diverse developmental processes, to date, none of them has been clearly involved in the control of skeletal muscle differentiation. Identification of many key transcription factors involved in myogenesis, such as the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors, has been possible because the formation of muscle fibers can be recreated ex vivo. Muscle differentiation is characterized by withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle, induction of muscle-specific gene expression, and cell fusion into multinucleated myotubes. All of these events are coordinated by members of the MyoD family of myogenic bHLH proteins (MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4) (for reviews, see Refs. 18.Miller J. Schaefer L. Dominov A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 19.Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To determine whether Sox genes were involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, we isolated Sox genes that are expressed at different levels in proliferating murine C2C12 myoblasts or fully differentiated myotubes. We used highly degenerate PCR primers that have previously been shown to amplify a broad range of SOX HMG box sequences (20.Cremazy F. Soullier S. Berta P. Jay P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We isolated Sox4, Sox8, andSox9 cDNAs at similar frequencies in both cell types, whereas the Sox15 cDNAs were found at a much higher frequency in proliferative myoblasts (9% of isolated cDNAs) than in differentiated cells (1%). Here, we describe the characterization of full-length murine Sox15, a novel member of the SOX family. Sequence analysis indicates that Sox15 is most likely the mouse homologue of human SOX20 and belongs to group G of the SOX gene family. We present data showing that SOX15 may function as a negative regulator of muscle differentiation. Indeed, myoblasts overexpressing SOX15, under conditions that normally lead to differentiation, (i) were not able to express the early differentiation marker myogenin, (ii) failed to activate muscle-specific gene expression as assessed by a MCK luciferase assay, and (iii) did not fuse into multinucleated myotubes. Looking at earlier points in the muscle differentiation pathway, we found that (iv) SOX15 inhibited the expression of MyoD in proliferating myoblasts. The specificity of SOX15 inhibition was demonstrated by the incapacity of either a C-terminal deleted mutant of SOX15 or another member of the SOX protein family, SOX11, to inhibit differentiation. C2C12 myoblasts (21.Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar) were grown in a proliferation medium composed of 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and 50% nutrient mixture F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Eurobio). To induce differentiation, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, and 48–72 h later, the cells were harvested for assays. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Total RNA was extracted using the guanidine isothiocyanate/acid phenol method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Dynal). For the identification of Soxgenes in C2C12 muscle cells, 500 ng of poly(A)+ RNA were reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptTM kit according to the instruction of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 μl of this reaction was amplified using the highly degenerate primers P5–1 and P3–1 as described in Ref. 20.Cremazy F. Soullier S. Berta P. Jay P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar. Amplification products were subcloned into pUC18, using the SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced. To isolate Sox15full-length cDNA, 1 μl of cDNA from C2C12 myoblasts was amplified with primers specific for mouse Sox15, 5′-TAATGGATCCCGGGTTATGGCGCTGACCAGCTCCTCA-3′ and 5′-GTGTTTAGTGTGCATTCTGG-3′, yielding a 770-base pair product. PCR products were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the eucaryotic vector pRK5myc downstream and in-frame with the Myc epitope MEQKLISEEDL and then sequenced. Poly(A)+ RNA from organs of adult mice and whole embryos was isolated directly on poly d(U) paper (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in Ref. 23.Goldsborough A.S. Kornberg T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12696-12700Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. Semiquantitative analysis of the abundance of Sox15 mRNA was done by RT-PCR. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from myoblasts, and 10-fold dilutions were reverse-transcribed. Subsequent amplifications of the resulting cDNA were carried out with primers specific for mouse Sox15 and Myf5, a low abundance mRNA in myoblasts. The number of amplification cycles was adjusted such that the abundance of products reflected the dilutions used for reverse transcription. Parallel PCR amplification of known amounts ofSox15 and Myf5 plasmids served as an internal control. All PCR products were analyzed on ethidium bromide stained 2% agarose gels, and their specific fluorescence quantified using the AlphaImagerTM imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The sequences of specific primers for the detection of Myf-5 were 5′-TGTCTGGTCCCGAAAGAACAGCAG-3′ and 5′-TAGCAGGAGTGATCATCGGGAGAG-3′. Deletion mutants SOX15 (1–125) and SOX15 (1–181) were generated in the context of pRK5myc-tagged Sox15. To create SOX15 (1–125), pRK5myc-tagged Sox15 was digested at the internal XhoI site (open reading frame position 372), filled in with DNA polymerase 1 Klenow fragment, and religated with T4 DNA ligase. This strategy introduced a stop codon, 8 amino acids behind the HMG domain of SOX15. The same approach was used to construct SOX15 (1–181) by digesting at the PstI site (open reading frame position 537) and religating the truncated fragment using a vector PstI site at the 3′ end. C2C12 cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h in proliferation medium, transfected cells were placed in differentiation medium for the indicated times and harvested for luciferase or immunofluorescence assays. Subconfluent COS7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the different expression plasmids and 7 μl of the liposome DC CHOL (24.Gao X. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) in 200 μl of serum-free medium. After a 5-h incubation, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum, and the cells were harvested after 48 h. Preparation of nuclear extracts from transfected COS7 cells and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were done as described previously (25.Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.P. Goze C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26.De Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Sudbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The DNA probes used in this assay were complementary double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, including the SOX binding site for SRY (5′-GGAGACTGAAAACAATGCGCTCTCA-3′) and T-cell factor (5′-GGAGA-CTGAGAACAAAGCGCTCTCA-3′), and two mutated versions of this site (Mut 1–2, 5′-GGAGACTGAGACCAAAGCGCTCTCA-3′, and Mut 3–4, 5′-GGAGACTGAG C ACAAAGCGCTCTCA-3′; mutated nucleotides are underlined). For competition or supershift experiments, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or antibody solution was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before the probe was added. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography after fixation with 10%methanol-10% acetic acid. Cells were lysed directly in Laemmli sample buffer (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 15% acrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, 0.45 μm) using a semidry blotting system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% skim milk powder (Fluka) (PBST+M). After an incubation of 1 h with 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (TEBU, Le Perray-en-Yuelynes France) diluted 1/2000 in PBST+M, the membrane was washed three times with PBST and incubated for 1 h with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1/5000 in PBST+M. The membrane was washed three times with PBST and developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and extracted in acetone at −20 °C for 1 min. Fixed cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with anti-tag antibodies (either mouse anti-Myc 9E10 or mouse anti-HA) and rabbit anti-myogenin (TEBU, France) diluted 1/100 in PBS-BSA. After three washes in PBS, cells were further incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; dilution, 1/100) for 30 min at 37 °C. Staining was finally revealed after an incubation of 30 min with Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; dilution, 1/100) and fluorescein conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cappel; dilution, 1/40). DNA was stained with Hoechst 33286. Cells were washed and mounted in FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Images were collected and processed on a Zeiss Axiophot. Plasmids used for luciferase assays were pRL-TK (Promega, Charbonnieres France), and MCK-FLuc (muscle creatine kinase enhancer and promoter upstream of firefly luciferase gene; gift from Dr. S. Leibovitch, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of total plasmid DNA composed of pRK5 or pRK5myc-tagged Sox15/MLCK-FLuc/pRL-TK plasmids (ratio, 2/1/1). Following incubation for 24 h in proliferation medium and 36 h in differentiation medium, transfected cells were harvested for luciferase assays. Activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured sequentially using the Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay kit reagent as described by the manufacturer (Promega). In order to identifySox genes involved in muscle differentiation, we used a RT-PCR screen to search for genes that are differentially expressed between murine C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. The RT-PCR strategy used highly degenerate PCR primers designed from a multiple alignment of HMG domain sequences representative of the SRY/SOX protein family (20.Cremazy F. Soullier S. Berta P. Jay P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These primers hybridize to a broad spectrum of SOX sequences and together amplify a 180-base pair sequence from the 240-base pair HMG box. C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes served as the source of template mRNA for RT-PCR. Two hundred independent cloned PCR products for each cell type were analyzed by automatic sequencing and/or cross-hybridization experiments. In myoblasts and myotubes,Sox4, Sox8, and Sox9 were the most frequently detected Sox genes, each representing approximately 30% of all clones. Analysis of the clones differentially expressed between the two cell stages, 18 clones (9% of all clones) corresponding to the Sox15 HMG box were detected in proliferating myoblasts whereas only 2 (1% of all clones) were isolated from differentiated C2C12 cells. A BLAST sequence similarity search with the Sox15 HMG box sequence produced a match with a mouse genomic sequence derived from chromosome 11 and corresponding to the Sox15 gene (GenBankTM accession numberAB014474). 2Miyashita, A., Shimizu, N., Endo, N., Hanyuv. T., Ishii, N., Ito, K., Itoh, Y., Shirai, M., Nakajima, T., Odani, S. and Kuwano, R. unpublished results. We amplified the full-length Sox15 cDNA from C2C12 myoblasts RNA using 5′ and 3′ specific primers derived from the genomic sequence. The open reading frame of Sox15 encodes a 231-amino acid protein that is particularly rich in proline (11.2%), serine (13%), and glycine (8.6%) (Fig. 1 A). The N-terminal domain of the protein contains putative casein kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (positions 7–10 and 78–80, respectively). Our sequence analysis shows a nucleotide difference (G → A) from the data base-derived sequence at nucleotide position 211 of the open reading frame, thus changing the coding sequence to the highly conserved lysine found in all SOX proteins described so far. Comparison of protein sequences revealed the best match with the recently cloned human SOX20 gene (74% amino acid identity) (Fig. 1 B) (28.Hiraoka Y. Ogawa M. Sakai Y. Taniguchi K. Fujii T. Umezawa A. Hata J. Aiso S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29.Vujic M. Rajic T. Goodfellow P.N. Stevanovic M. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 1059-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). SOX proteins have the ability to recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences via their HMG domain. Among the HMG box protein family, this ability for sequence-specific DNA recognition is unique to SOX proteins and the distantly related T-cell factor/LEF family (30.Laudet V. Stehelin D. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The consensus DNA binding site for SOX proteins has been defined as the heptameric sequence 5′-(A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G-3′. To test whether SOX15 was able to bind the same target nucleotide sequence, nuclear extracts were prepared from COS 7 cells transfected with Myc-tagged sox15 cDNA. We performed gel mobility shift assays using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes corresponding to two SOX binding site consensus sequences (SRY and T-cell factor binding sites, respectively) (see under “Materials and Methods”). Similar results were obtained with the two probes. As shown in Fig.2 A, nuclear extracts from COS7 cells transfected with wild type Sox15 gave rise to a major protein-DNA complex (lane 1) in the presence of the labeled SOX binding site oligonucleotide. No band was observed in COS7 cells transfected with an empty eucaryotic expression vector (data not shown). We confirmed the identity of the retarded band detected in cells expressing SOX15 by supershift experiments. Preincubation of nuclear extracts in the presence of increasing quantities of 9E10 monoclonal anti-Myc antibody produced a supershift band in both cases (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3). The specificity of the interaction was determined with unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. Greatly reduced DNA binding was observed in the presence of an excess of wild type oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and5), and the binding was partially inhibited with mutant oligonucleotides, as expected (lanes 6–9). SOX proteins can function as either transcriptional activators or transcriptional repressors. These properties are mediated by a C-terminal domain of the protein, presumably by interacting with accessory proteins that help to stabilize the DNA binding of SOX proteins (3.Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 31.Uchikawa M. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to study the effect of C-terminal deletions on SOX15 DNA binding activity. SOX15 (1–125) is truncated immediately after the DNA binding domain, whereas SOX15 (1–181) retains only one half of the C-terminal domain. Western blot analysis of Myc-tagged wild type and C-terminal deleted SOX15 proteins in total cellular extracts of transfected COS7 cells showed that the wild type and mutant SOX15 proteins migrate at their predicted molecular weights (Fig. 2 B). Using nuclear extracts prepared from COS7 cells transfected with either wild type or the deleted forms ofSox15, encoding amino acids 1–125 and 1–181 (not shown), all of the SOX15 proteins bound the same DNA consensus sequence, yielding DNA-protein complexes with different mobilities, which were partially supershifted in the presence of 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Fig.2 C). These results demonstrate that the C-terminal truncated proteins are still capable of binding DNA. Because Sox15 appeared to be enriched in proliferating myoblasts, we decided to study the effect of SOX15 overexpression on muscle differentiation. Vectors expressing Myc-tagged SOX15 or the deleted forms SOX15 (1–125) and SOX15 (1–181) were transfected into C2C12 myoblasts. After 24 h in proliferation medium, cells were switched into a medium promoting differentiation for 48–72 h. Commitment of transfected cells into differentiation was assessed by immunofluorescence using the Myc-tagged SOX15-overexpressed proteins and observing the expression of myogenin as an early marker of differentiation. As shown in Fig.3 A, SOX15 localizes in the nucleus, in agreement with its expected role as a transcription factor. Furthermore, wild type SOX15 expressing cells do not undergo differentiation. They remain negative for myogenin and do not show any of the features associated with myotube formation i.e.multinucleation and membrane fusion. By marked contrast, cells transfected with the truncated form SOX15 (1–125) do express myogenin and can differentiate apparently normally into myotubes, demonstrating that the C-terminal domain is absolutely required to inhibit differentiation. Surprisingly, we were not able to overexpress SOX15 (1–181) in myoblasts because it appeared to be toxic for myoblasts when they are placed in differentiation medium. We do not currently understand the basis for the observed cell death. To assess the specificity of SOX15 inhibition of muscle differentiation, we overexpressed in C2C12 cells another member of the SOX family, human SOX11, thought to be involved in the maturation of the central nervous system (32.Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, cells overexpressing HA-tagged SOX11 can fully differentiate into multinucleated myotubes that also express myogenin, supporting the view that inhibition of myogenesis is specific for SOX15. To determine whether SOX15 was acting upstream or downstream of the master control gene MyoD, an immunofluorescence experiment was performed on C2C12 proliferating cells. As shown in Fig.3 B, the overexpression of wild type SOX15 significantly impairs the expression of MyoD, whereas SOX15 (1–125) has no effect. These immunofluorescence studies were quantified by evaluating the proportion of transfected cells expressing the muscle differentiation markers MyoD and myogenin. Fig.4 A shows that overexpression of SOX15 antagonizes muscle differentiation, acting at a very early stage, before the expression of MyoD in the myogenesis pathway. To confirm the inhibitory role of SOX15 in myogenesis, we used transient co-transfection assays in C2C12 myoblasts with a muscle-specific promoter driving the expression of luciferase. The construct MCK-luc contains the upstream region from the muscle creatine kinase gene and has been shown to be directly transactivated by myogenic bHLH proteins during muscle differentiation (33.Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). As such, activation of MCK-luc provides a qualitative measurement of the extent of differentiation. Differentiation-dependent activation of the reporter gene was significantly inhibited by full-length SOX15 protein (Fig. 4 B); in contrast, the truncated form of SOX15 (1–125) has a smaller inhibitory effect on the reporter MCK-luc activity. The fact that in this assay the differentiation-dependent expression of the MCK-luc reporter was not completely repressed by SOX15 may reflect co-transfection efficiency. Northern blot analysis failed to detect Sox15 transcripts in several adult and fetal tissues. We therefore used RT-PCR to determine the tissue distribution of Sox15 mRNA. To avoid amplification of genomic DNA, PCR primers spanned an intron (Fig. 1 A). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control to measure cDNA quality and abundance. By RT-PCR, Sox15transcripts could be detected in all adult mouse tissues examined (brain, kidney, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, diaphragm, intestine, and testis), as well as in early mouse embryos (8.5 and 9.5 dpc) (Fig.5). However, Sox15 transcripts appear to be most abundant in skeletal muscle and brain, with more expressed in 9.5 dpc embryos than in 8.5 dpc embryos. In order to set the expression of Sox15 in the context of another transcription factor involved in myogenesis, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR amplifications on myoblasts poly(A)+ RNA withSox15- and Myf5-specific primers. In the linear range of the amplification reaction, we found that Sox15transcripts were at least 100-fold less abundant than Myf5transcripts (data not shown). In this paper, we report the characterization of a novelSOX gene, mouse Sox15, isolated in a screen for HMG box containing transcription factors expressed at different levels during myogenesis. Together with the sequence similarity within the human SOX20 HMG box, the high degree of conservation in their N- and C-terminal domains suggests a close evolutionary relationship between mouse Sox15 and the recently characterized human SOX20 gene (28.Hiraoka Y. Ogawa M. Sakai Y. Taniguchi K. Fujii T. Umezawa A. Hata J. Aiso S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29.Vujic M. Rajic T. Goodfellow P.N. Stevanovic M. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 1059-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The two proteins share 74% homology in their coding sequence. Although most of the SOX proteins are encoded from a single exon, mouse Sox15 and human SOX20 are the only members of the SOX family having an intron located at the 3′ end and not interrupting the HMG domain. Based on this characteristic and on sequence homology within the HMG box, hSOX20 and Sox15 define a new group (G) of theSOX gene family. Sox15 transcripts appear to be ubiquitously expressed in adult mouse tissue, although transcripts are more abundant in brain and skeletal muscle tissues. Levels of expression are low, as we were unable to detect Sox15 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. However, in the RT-PCR differential screen, cDNA encoding SOX15 were found at a higher frequency in myoblasts than in differentiated cells, suggesting a down-regulation of Sox15 during differentiation. This observation prompted us to investigate a potential role for SOX15 in myogenesis. C2C12 cells transfected with expression vectors coding for wild type SOX15 failed to differentiate and were not able to express the muscle promoting factor MyoD. This repressive role for SOX15 was specific because neither overexpression of a C-terminal deleted form of SOX15 nor the related SOX family member SOX11 caused a block to differentiation. That cells expressing a C-terminal deleted form of SOX15 were still able to differentiate into myotubes strongly suggests that C-terminal sequences are required for SOX15 inhibition of muscle differentiation. Previous analysis have shown that C-terminal domains of several SOX proteins are capable of activating transcription (9.van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 32.Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 34.Sudbeck P. Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. Scherer G. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). More recently, the C-terminal sequences of chicken SOX14 and SOX21 were shown to act as repressor domains, providing evidence for a repressive activity of SOX proteins (31.Uchikawa M. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In several attempts to characterize a transcriptional activity for SOX15 using a luciferase reporter gene under the control of seven consensus SOX binding sites (35.van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Dooijes D. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect any changes in reporter gene expression. However, we could only measure activation in this assay, and if SOX15 is a repressor, we would not be able to measure its activity. Direct target genes regulated by SOX15 remain to be identified but would be expected to be those expressed at very early stages of muscle differentiation. SOX genes show diverse and dynamic patterns of expression throughout embryogenesis, and members of the SOX gene family are involved in many different aspects of development. In the RT-PCR differential screen that identified SOX15, other members of the SOX family were isolated from myoblasts and myotubes; some, such as SOX9, are known to be strong activators of transcription. We do not know what role, if any, these proteins play in myogenesis. Our RT-PCR expression analysis has shown that Sox15 gene transcripts could be detected in a wide variety of adult mouse tissues, as well as in early mouse embryos. This result suggests that SOX15 function is not restricted to muscle differentiation. Perhaps the function of SOX15 is to repress muscle development in all other tissues. Alternatively, an accessory factor may be required to promote SOX15 activity in myoblast progenitor cells. In support of this view, activation of the δ1-crystallin gene in lens cells depends on the interaction of SOX1/2/3 with the partner factor δEF3, which probably has a tissue-restricted expression (6.Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Collignon J. Lovell-Badge R. Kondoh H. Development. 1998; 125: 2521-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Few proteins are known to inhibit the function of the bHLH myogenic factor MyoD in myoblasts (for a review, see Ref. 36.Emerson Jr., C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Tight regulation of MyoD activity ensures that myoblasts do not precociously enter into differentiation. We have shown that SOX15 acts as a powerful inhibitor of MyoD expression, explaining its repressive role on muscle differentiation. Because SOX15 may act as a transcription factor, we cannot rule out the possibility that other critical regulators of muscle differentiation, such as the MEF-2 transcription factors, or co-factors of MyoD, such as the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb), may also be regulated by SOX15. As such, SOX15 could interfere with muscle differentiation by regulating, in addition to MyoD, a set of genes involved in this process. Whether SOX15 regulates directly or indirectly MyoD remains to be determined. To date, relatively little is known about the transcription factors that control MyoD expression. At least three transcription factors (Pax-3 (37.Kucharczuk K.L. Love C.M. Dougherty N.M. Goldhamer D.J. Development. 1999; 126: 1957-1965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzman M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), Myf-5 (37.Kucharczuk K.L. Love C.M. Dougherty N.M. Goldhamer D.J. Development. 1999; 126: 1957-1965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the serum response factor SRF (38.Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzman M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) have been postulated as upstream regulators of MyoD. However, it is not known whether these factors or SOX15 act directly by binding to the MyoD regulatory regions. This may be due to the complexity of the MyoD gene, which is regulated by at least three different enhancers located up to 20 kilobases upsteam from the transcription start site. One of these regions, the distal regulatory region, is unusual because it requires stable chromosomal integration for muscle-specific activity (39.Tapscott S.J. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4994-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distal regulatory region contains several putative SOX binding sites, one of which is identical to the T-cell factor binding site used in our study. Whether SOX15 binds to such sites remain to be elucidated. In light of recent results (40.Zorn A.M. Barish G.D. Williams B.O. Lavender P. Klymkowsky M.W. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), we can propose another model to explain SOX15-induced down-regulation of myogenesis. Three members of the SOX family (Xsox17α, Xsox17β, and Xsox3) have been reported to repress Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos by interacting with β-catenin. The C-terminal region of Xsox17β, without the DNA binding HMG box, is sufficient to inhibit β-catenin activity. Wnt signals modulate cell fate and proliferation in many different adult and embryonic cells and induce myogenic bHLH gene expression in somites (41.Munsterberg A.E. Kitajewski J. Bumcrot D.A. McMahon A.P. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). We have shown that the presence of the SOX15 C-terminal domain was necessary for myogenesis inhibition. We can speculate that SOX15 could down-regulate muscle differentiation by interacting with β-catenin via its C-terminal domain, thereby repressing Wnt signaling in muscle cells. SOX proteins may therefore play a general role in regulating tissue responses to Wnt signals.

Sulfated Nod factors of S. meliloti are more resistant to degradation than the corresponding nonsulfated molecules (21.Staehelin C. Schultze M. Kondorosi E. Mellor R.B. Boller T. Kondorosi A.

Here, the influence of Nod factor amounts and substitutions on nodulation efficiency was investigated in the symbiosis betweenAzorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 and the tropical legumeSesbania rostrata. S. rostrata can be nodulated on the stem and on the root at adventitious rootlets and at the bases of lateral roots, respectively. The Nod factors of A. caulinodans are mainly pentamers that are vaccenoylated (C18:1), palmitoylated (C16:0), or stearoylated (C18:0). The nonreducing-terminal residue carries anN-methyl and a 6-O-carbamoyl group, and the reducing-terminal residue may be substituted with ad-arabinosyl group, an l-fucosyl group, or both (25.Mergaert P.

Azorhizobial nodulation genes for the synthesis and secretion of Nod factors are clustered in the nodABCSUIJZnoeC operon and thenolK operon (Fig. 1). A collection of bacterial mutants producing well characterized altered Nod factors was used in stem and root nodulation assays. Additionally, purified Nod factors were assayed for biological activity and for stability against degradation.

Although a large number of activation domains are known, these functional modules share little sequence homology and have only loosely been classified by the preponderance of amino acid residues such as acidic residues, glutamine, and proline (1.Tjian R.

This low homology of activation domains has made it difficult to characterize these essential modules in transcription factors. Identification of functional sequence motifs that are hidden in activation domains would dissect the functions of activation domains and help to understand their composite regulations. Multiple target proteins for each class of activation domains have been proposed, including the basal transcriptional factors, mediators, and chromatin-remodeling factors. One such direct target for acidic activators is hTAFII31 (a human TFIID TATA box-binding protein-associated factor) (5.Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R.

These previous results collectively suggest a general role of hTAFII31 and its homologs in the regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription both at the level of chromatin modification and RNA polymerase recruitment (16.Hahn S.

It has been reported that hTAFII31 makes direct contacts with the activation domains of VP16, p53, and NF-κB p65 and that the strength of the interactions correlates with the ability to activate transcription (5.Goodrich J.A.

Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). NMR and biochemical studies have shown that the activation domains of VP16 and p53 undergo an induced transition from random coil to α-helix upon interaction with hTAFII31, with key hydrophobic residues along one face of the nascent helix (17.Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14801-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The pattern of such hydrophobic residues, FXXΦΦ (where X represents any residue and Φ represents any hydrophobic residue) is conserved among the activation domains of VP16, p53, and NF-κB p65, suggesting that this sequence represents a recognition element for hTAFII31. Here we delineate the peptide sequences that are required for transactivation and for interaction with hTAFII31. Our analyses indicate that hTAFII31 recognizes a more divergent set of peptide sequences than FXXΦΦ for the transmission of activation signals. This sequence characterization enabled the identification of hTAFII31-binding sequences hidden in the activation domains of NFAT1, ALL1, NF-IL6, ESX, and HSF-1. A combination of mutational studies and NMR analyses indicated that the interaction surfaces comprise short peptide regions containing signature α-helical motifs. Furthermore, the strength of the interactions between these activators and hTAFII31 correlates with the ability to activate transcription in human cells, supporting the notion that hTAFII31 and its homologs are important targets of eukaryotic transactivators. We constructed four small libraries of a mammalian expression vector, each encoding a 17-amino acid peptide from the VP16 activation domain (VP16-(469–485)) fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Each of the four libraries consists of random point mutants at one of the four positions within the FXXΦΦ sequence of VP16-(469–485) ( Phe 479- Thr 480-Asp481- Ala 482- Leu 483). 192 clones from each library were miniprepped and individually transfected into human Jurkat Tag cells in two 96-well plates (100 ng/well of expression plasmid and ∼105 cells/well). The reporter construct we used (120 ng/well) was pG5IL2SX in which the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)1 gene is controlled by five GAL4-binding sites. After a 48-h incubation, each well was assayed for SEAP activity through fluorescence change of 4-methylumbeliferyl phosphate as described (19.Belshaw P.J. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4604-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out by a microplate reader, Fluoroskan II (Labsystems). Positive clones were characterized by DNA sequencing, and their activities were quantitatively estimated through repeated transfection experiments in a larger volume. The protein hTAFII31-(1–140) was purified as described (18.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of activation domains were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads. The beads binding either glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein or GST only were incubated with hTAFII31-(1–140) in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 25 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with the same buffer, the bound hTAFII31-(1–140) was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (residues 1–94) was subcloned into theHindIII/KpnI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and the resultant pcDNAGAL4 plasmid was used to construct mammalian expression vectors for GAL4 fusions of ALL1-(2829–2883), NFIL6-(24–124), ESX-(129–159), HSF-1-(371–430) and NFAT1-(1–96). Jurkat Tag cells (∼2 × 106) were transfected with 500 ng of each GAL4 fusion construct along with 2 μg of pG5IL2SX. After a 48-h incubation, an aliquot of the culture was removed and assayed for SEAP activity as described (19.Belshaw P.J. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4604-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The expression levels of the GAL4 fusion proteins were comparable, as judged by Western blot analyses using an antibody against the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Peptides were synthesized using Rink Amide MBHA resin, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by NMR, amino acid analyses, and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. The peptide was dissolved in 95% H2O plus 5% 2H2O containing 130 mmKCl, 5 mm perdeuterated dithiothreitol, 20 mmperdeuterated Tris-AcOH (pH 6.2), and 10 μm EDTA, and then the pH of the solution was adjusted to ∼6.2 by adding dilute KOH. The final concentrations of peptides were determined by UV absorption or amino acid analyses to be ∼4 mm. NMR experiments were performed in the absence or presence of hTAFII31-(1–140) (240 μm) on a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer. The sequential assignment of the peptide signals was obtained by using a combination of total correlation spectroscopy, DQF-COSY, and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) data sets of a free peptide sample. Sequentiald αN(i, i + 1) NOEs, although weak, were observed in the NOESY spectra of the free peptide, which served as a basis for the complete sequential assignment. In the NOESY spectra, 512 free induction decays were recorded at 290 or 300 K with mixing times of 350 ms. The data were processed with the Felix 98.0 software (Biosym Technologies) with appropriate apodization and zero-filling. To delineate the peptide sequences required for transactivation through interaction with hTAFII31, we first constructed four small libraries of a mammalian expression vector, each encoding a 17-amino acid peptide from the VP16 activation domain (VP16-(469–485)) fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. VP16-(469–485) was chosen because it is the minimal VP16 peptide that binds a fragment of hTAFII31 (hTAFII31-(1–140)) and activates transcription (18.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Each of the four libraries consists of random point mutants at one of the four positions within the FXXΦΦ sequence of VP16-(469–485) ( Phe 479- Thr 480-Asp481- Ala 482- Leu 483). 192 clones from each library were miniprepped and individually transfected into human Jurkat T cells in 96-well plates. We cotransfected the cells with a reporter containing the SEAP gene under the control of five GAL4-binding sites. This permits convenient detection of transcriptional activation through fluorescence change of a phosphatase substrate. The DNA sequence analyses of positive clones (>50% SEAP activity of the wild type) revealed that the ability of VP16-(469–485) to activate transcription can endure a variety of amino acid substitutions (Fig.1). The screen identified Trp, Ile, and Leu at the conserved position of Phe479; substitution of Phe479 with any one of the three residues exhibited no substantial loss in its transcriptional activity. The mutation of Phe479 with Val abrogated much of its activation potential, thus validating our screen and indicating the presence of a clear boundary between Leu and Val for the activity. At the positions of Thr480 and Ala482, we obtained many clones that activate transcription more than 50% of the wild type. Although hydrophobic residues are favored at these two positions, clones with some of hydrophilic residues such as Tyr also had significant activity. The identity of Leu483 is more tightly controlled, since we isolated only Trp, Phe, and Leu as positive clones. Clones with the other bulky hydrophobic residues, i.e. Ile and Val, at this position exhibited less than 20% activity of the wild type. However, the simultaneous substitution of Ala482 with a bulky hydrophobic residue (Trp, Phe, Ile, or Leu) restored the transcriptional level of the Ile and Val mutants to >50% of the wild type, indicative of the complementarity between these two adjacent positions. The peptide sequences examined above were then fused with GST and tested for the ability to bind hTAFII31-(1–140). As shown in Fig. 1, the activation-positive peptides bound hTAFII31-(1–140) to the same extent as the wild type, whereas the binding of activation-deficient peptides was significantly impaired. Thus the strength of the interaction with hTAFII31-(1–140) in vitro correlates with the ability to activate transcription in transfected cells. Guided by the information obtained from the screen, we searched for potential hTAFII31-binding sequences in human activation domains. A series of selection steps was carried out on the activation domains of 65 distinct human transcription factors. The amino acid sequences of these 65 activation domains and their original references are available on the World Wide Web and in the supplemental materials. In an initial step, we selected for any activation domains that contain a signatureP1-P2-X-P3-P4 sequence (where P1 represents Phe, Trp, Ile, or Leu; P2 represents Ile, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Met, Asn, Ala, Thr, Val, Ser, Glu, or Gln; X represents any amino acid; and P3-P4 represents Trp/Phe/Ile/Leu-Trp/Phe/Leu/Ile/Val or Ala/Tyr/Val/Cys/Met-Trp/Phe/Leu) and found 26 that did so. Those activation domains whose signature sequences were not conserved among species and subtypes were eliminated in a second step, and a third elimination step was then run on the remaining candidates by calculating the probability of α-helix formation of their signature sequences. 15 candidates were eliminated by the second and third steps. For example, the activation domain of cell cycle regulator E2F1 was eliminated because its signature sequence, FSGLL, was not conserved in its chicken homolog (FP GFL) and because these sequences had little α-helix probability. The activation domain of MSG1 was also eliminated because its signature sequence, LMSLV, was not conserved in a subtype of its mouse homolog (LTSLE ). As expected, the activation domains of E2F1 and MSG1 had no detectable affinity to hTAFII31, validating our elimination steps (data not shown). 11 activation domains survived all three elimination steps. These are the activation domains of ALL1, NF-IL6, NFAT1, Sox-4, MyoD, c-Jun, HIF-1α, TEF-1, HSF-1, TREB5, and ESX (Fig.2 A). The peptide segments that correspond to VP16-(469–485) were fused to GST and assayed for the ability to bind hTAFII31. Only the peptides of ALL1, NF-IL6, ESX, HSF-1, and NFAT1 bound hTAFII31 as tightly as VP16-(469–485) (Fig. 2 B). The full-length activation domains of these factors were further analyzed. NFAT1 (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells 1) belongs to the NFAT family of transcription factors and plays a central role in inducible gene transcription during the immune response. Whereas the full-length activation domain of NFAT1 (amino acids 1–96) bound hTAFII31-(1–140) to the same extent as its peptide version, mutation of Phe30 and Phe34 with Ala impaired its interaction (Fig.3 A), indicative of direct involvement of the signature sequence in the interaction with hTAFII31. ALL1 (acute lymphoblasticleukemia gene product; also referred as HRX or MILL) is a human transcription factor that is involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20.Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 21.Gu Y. Nakamura T. Alder H. Prasad R. Canaani O. Cimino G. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cell. 1992; 71: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), and its transcriptional activity is considered to be responsible for malignant transformation (22.Prasad R. Yano T. Sorio C. Nakamura T. Rallapalli R. Gu Y. Leshkowitz D. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We identified the Ile2849-Met2850-Asp2851-Phe2852-Val2853sequence in its activation domain as a hTAFII31-binding motif. This was in good agreement with the previous mutational studies showing the importance of these residues in transactivation (22.Prasad R. Yano T. Sorio C. Nakamura T. Rallapalli R. Gu Y. Leshkowitz D. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the full-length activation domain of ALL1 (amino acids 2829–2883) bound hTAFII31-(1–140) as tightly as its peptide version. Substitution of Ile2849 and Val2853 by Ala greatly impaired the interaction, indicative of the involvement of the IMDFV sequence in the interaction. NF-IL6 (nuclear factorinterleukin-6; also referred as C/EBPβ or LAP) induces cytokine genes and has been implicated as a master regulator of the acute-phase response (23.Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). Its full-length activation domain (amino acids 24–124) (24.Trautwein C. Walker D.L. Plumpe J. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15130-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) bound hTAFII31-(1–140) to the same extent as its peptide version. This interaction appears to be mediated by the LSDLF sequence, since substitution of Leu118 and Phe122 by Ala impairs the interaction. The (L/F)(S/A)DLF sequence is conserved among the activation domains of C/EBPs, and amino acid substitutions in the conserved region in rC/EBPα adversely affect its transactivation potential (25.Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26.Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). HSF-1 (heat shock factor 1) responds a multitude of stress conditions and plays an important role in the molecular response to nonnative proteins (27.Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), and its activation domain is known to be highly potent (28.Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We found a hTAFII31-binding motif in its COOH-terminal half, which was consistent with the previous truncation studies (29.Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Whereas the full-length activation domain of HSF-1 (amino acids 371–430) bound hTAFII31-(1–140) to the same extent as its peptide version, mutation of Leu414 and Phe418 with Ala impaired its interaction (Fig.3 A), indicative of direct involvement of the signature sequence in the interaction with hTAFII31. Last, we identified a hTAFII31-binding sequence in the activation domain of ESX (an epithelium-restricted Ets factor) that regulates the expression of the HER2/neu (c-erbB2) oncogene in human breast cancer (30.Neve R. Chang C.H. Scott G.K. Wong A. Friis R.R. Hynes N.E. Benz C.C. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and has been found to be overexpressed at an early stage of human breast cancer development (31.Chang C.H. Scott G.K. Kuo W.L. Xiong X. Suzdaltseva Y. Park J.W. Sayre P. Erny K. Collins C. Gray J.W. Benz C.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Once again, the ESX activation domain (amino acids 129–159) bound hTAFII31-(1–140) as tightly as its peptide version. Substitution of Ile139 and Leu143 by Ala compromised this interaction, indicating that the interaction is mediated at least in part by the IIELL sequence. To analyze the ability to activate transcription, each activator was fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and its expression plasmid was transfected into human Jurkat T cells along with the reporter plasmid driven by five copies of the GAL4-binding element. As shown in Fig.3 B, the interaction-deficient mutants of the activation domains were correspondingly unable to activate transcription of the reporter gene, whereas the wild type proteins activated transcription, similar to the VP16 activation domain (VP16452–490). This functional reduction of the mutants is not the result of differences in their expression levels as judged by Western analyses. Thus, the hTAFII31-binding sequences of NFAT1, ALL1, NF-IL6, HSF-1, and ESX are critical for their ability to activate transcription; perhaps hTAFII31 directly mediates the transcriptional activation by these human factors. However, it is not impossible to imagine that the same amino acids involved in the interaction with hTAFII31 may also interact with surfaces in some other co-activators. Including p53 and p65, we have now obtained a total of seven human activation domains whose activities are critically dependent on their hTAFII31-binding sequences. Their amino acid sequences are compared in Fig. 2 A. Apart from the COOH-terminal signature sequences, the hTAFII31-binding peptides have no sequence similarity among themselves. Nonetheless, the NH2-terminal nonhomology region is necessary for binding because truncation of the NH2-terminal five residues in ALL1-(2839–2855) and VP16-(469–485) abolish hTAFII31 binding (18.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). To compare the conformations of the hTAFII31-binding peptides upon binding to hTAFII31, each peptide was chemically synthesized and analyzed by transferred nuclear Overhauser effects (TRNOE), an NMR technique that provides conformational information of a small ligand interacting weakly with its macromolecular receptor (18.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 32.Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 99-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Only ALL12839–2855 and NF-IL6108–124 showed good physical properties under NMR conditions and were amenable to TRNOE analyses. NOESY spectra of the free peptides exhibited few NOEs, as expected from low molecular weight peptides tumbling freely in solution. In the presence of hTAFII31-(1–140), however, numerous TRNOE peaks newly appeared, including those between successive amide protons in the main chain (Fig. 4, B and C). The pattern of these cross-peaks and the presence of long ranged αN(i, i + 3) andd αβ(i, i + 3) NOEs suggest the formation of short α-helices encompassing the signature motifs in ALL1-(2839–2855) and NF-IL6-(108–124). No TRNOEs were observed with a control 17-amino acid peptide that has a similar acidicity/hydrophobicity profile but no affinity to hTAFII31, indicating that the interaction with hTAFII31-(1–140) under the NMR condition is specific (data not shown). These results support the notion that the interactions between activation domains and hTAFII31 are mediated generally by short α-helices in the activators. In ALL1-(2839–2855) and NF-IL6-(108–124), the NH2-terminal halves appear to be in an extended conformation, and we failed to detect any NOEs that suggest the formation of a folded structure in this region. These nonhomology segments thus may make variable contributions to the association, possibly by lowering the energetic barrier for helix formation or by making additional contacts with the surface of hTAFII31, perhaps including those between main chain amide groups in the peptides and chemically complementary functional groups in hTAFII31. Our analyses indicate that hTAFII31 recognizes a diverse set of peptide sequences in activation domains. There are two advantages for the cells in using such a promiscuous interaction for transactivation. One is the weakness of the interaction; the dissociation constant of the interaction between hTAFII31 and the VP16 activation domain is in the high micromolar range, and the weakness of the interactions is often translated to the diversity of binding sequences. Synergism of such weak interactions between activators and co-activators makes transactivation signals diverse and steep enough to emulate a binary switch (3.Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 33.Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 34.Sauer F. Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 270: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Low affinity interactions also permit dynamic modulation in response to the alteration of signals that high affinity interactions would be unable to generate (35.Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, the coupling of weak interactions with transcriptional activation may be ideal for eukaryotic cells that respond to various signals in a highly tuned manner. Another advantage is the fact that each one of the binding sequences can be unique enough to be recognized specifically by its regulatory proteins. This permits specific modulation of activity of particular transcription factors in response to the alteration of signals. For example, the MDM2 protein, a cellular attenuator of p53, specifically recognizes and masks the hTAFII31-binding motif in the p53 activation domain while exhibiting no detectable affinity to any other activation domains that bind hTAFII31 (17.Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14801-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This differential recognition is evidently enabled by the heterogeneity of hTAFII31-binding sequences. Many phosphorylation sites can also be arranged in the hTAFII31-binding peptides for specific regulation (Fig. 2 A). Some of the Ser residues are indeed known to be phosphorylated upon particular stimuli. Ser15 and Ser20 in the p53 activation domain are phosphorylated upon DNA damage, and Ser15 is the site of the phosphorylation by the ATM kinase (36.Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S.

Lee P.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser536 in the activation domain of NF-κB p65 has been detected in TNF-α-induced cells (40.Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). It is also known that the activation potential of rat NF-IL6/LAP is directly enhanced by phosphorylation of the Ser residue that is 13 amino acids away from the hTAFII31 motif (41.Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of nonconserved Ser residues within or adjacent to hTAFII31-binding motifs may be a general strategy for building dynamic and specific characters into the regulation of transcription factors in higher eukaryotes. The physical association between activation domains and hTAFII31 requires a small surface comprising divergent peptide motifs in activation domains. The brevity and heterogeneity of the motifs obscure their existence in transactivators but add flexibility to the functions. It is now clear that hTAFII31 is just one of the many targets of activation domains, and other targets may also recognize short, divergent peptide sequences. The combinatorial presence of such motifs in a single activation domain would render a highly mosaic and cryptic nature to the activation domain.

https://openalex.org/W1974780888,"Calcium is an important regulator of mitochondrial function. Since there can be tight coupling between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ release and elevation of mitochondrial calcium concentration, we have investigated whether a similar relationship exists between the release of Ca2+ from the ryanodine receptor and the elevation of mitochondrial Ca2+. Perfusion of permeabilized A10 cells with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate resulted in a large transient elevation of mitochondrial Ca2+ to about 8 μm. The response was inhibited by heparin but not ryanodine. Perfusion of the cells with Ca2+ buffers in excess of 1 μm leads to large increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ that are much greater than the perfused Ca2+. These increases, which average around 10 μm, are enhanced by caffeine and inhibited by ryanodine and depletion of the intracellular stores with either orthovanadate or thapsigargin. We conclude that Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release at the ryanodine receptor generates microdomains of elevated Ca2+ that are sensed by adjacent mitochondria.

Acta. 1998; 1366: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the mitochondria have long been recognized to take up substantial amounts of Ca2+, the relationship between [Ca2+]m1and [Ca2+]c has been far from clear. The development of luminescent and fluorescent indicators that enable selective measurement of [Ca2+]m allowed these relations to be examined anew (5Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 6Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Initial studies using targeted aequorin revealed rapid and large transient elevations of [Ca2+]m in response to G-protein-coupled agonists. Both the transient nature and the large amplitude of the [Ca2+]m responses are explained by a hypothesis in which the mitochondria sense microdomains of highly elevated Ca2+ adjacent to the InsP3 release sites in the ER (7Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we found that in HeLa cells the ER and mitochondria were in close apposition, whereas in ECV304 cells (where influx had a greater influence on [Ca2+]m signaling) the mitochondria were more closely associated with the plasma membrane (8Lawrie A.M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Simpson A.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10753-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). More recently, experiments using green fluorescent protein mutants targeted to the ER and mitochondria revealed points of near contact between the mitochondria and the ER (9Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Experiments using fluorescent indicators also show [Ca2+]m responses to be dynamic; they follow [Ca2+]c oscillations in hepatocytes, myocytes, and astrocytes for example (6Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 10Isenberg G. Han S. Schiefer A. Wendt-Gallitelli M. Cardiovasc.

Harper I.S. Trollinger D.R. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Letts. 1996; 382: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since the mitochondria can take up Ca2+ during [Ca2+]c responses, it is not surprising to find increasing evidence for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release to be influencing [Ca2+]c responses (13Friel D.D. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Werth J.L. Thayer S.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 348-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Herrington J. Park Y.B.

Physiol. 1996; 431: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent publications suggest that the mitochondria influence Ca2+ release from InsP3-sensitive stores and Ca2+ influx by modulating [Ca2+]cadjacent to Ca2+ release sites (17Jouaville L.S. Ichas F. Holmuhamedov E.L. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol.

The InsP3 receptor is not the only conduit for Ca2+ release. In muscle cells, neurones, and even some nonexcitable cells, RyRs also act as the Ca2+ release channels (22Berridge M.J. Galione A. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3074-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Evidence points to the RyRs being closely associated with the mitochondria. In muscle tissue mitochondria and SR can be viewed in close proximity (23Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Shuman H. Endo M. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 2883-2890PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Duchen et al. (24Duchen M.R. Leyssens A. Crompton M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) demonstrated that unitary changes in Ψm are blocked by ryanodine. From the evidence available at present, it is not clear if CICR plays any direct role in the elevation of [Ca2+]m. On the one hand, the tight coupling between [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m in myocytes would suggest that [Ca2+]m can be elevated rapidly by SR Ca2+ release (10Isenberg G. Han S. Schiefer A. Wendt-Gallitelli M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas the data from smooth muscle cells imply that, whereas the SR acts as a source of Ca2+, [Ca2+]m is not elevated by the generation of privileged microdomains of released Ca2+ (25Drummond R.M. Tuft R.A. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle proves to be an interesting model to investigate the influence of Ca2+ release on [Ca2+]m. It possesses both InsP3and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels, thus enabling the influence of both channels on [Ca2+]m to be compared (21McCarron J.G. Muir T.C. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Drummond R.M. Tuft R.A. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although we recognize that the SR can act as a Ca2+ source for the elevation of [Ca2+]m, we were particularly interested if CICR played any pivotal role in the [Ca2+]m response. Our data point to Ca2+ release by both InsP3 and CICR as being mechanisms by which microdomains of elevated [Ca2+]c are generated. These microdomains act as a source of Ca2+ for large transient elevations of [Ca2+]m. A10 cells (ECCAC no. 86020301) derived from rat embryonic thoracic aorta were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humid incubator in 80-cm2 flasks containing 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma Poole). The cells were passaged onto 16-mm diameter coverslips placed in a 12-well plate and transfected with mtAEQ (5Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 26Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) in pCDNA1 using FuGENETM 6 transfection. Briefly, FuGENE™ 6 was diluted to 100 μl with sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% antibiotic and no serum. 1.5 μl of FuGENE™ 6 containing 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA was added to each well. Prior to experimentation, the culture medium was replaced with PS, containing 145 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). To reconstitute functional aequorin, the cells were then incubated with 6 μm coelenterazine for 2 h. The coverslips were placed in a purpose-built perfusion chamber, perfused with PS buffer held at 37 °C. Vasopressin was added to PS as indicated. For permeabilization PS was replaced with a high K+intracellular buffer (IB), containing 130 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm K2HPO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm Tris-succinate, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0 at 37 °C), 1 mm ATP, supplemented with 75 μmEGTA ([Ca2+], 50 nm). For permeabilization, digitonin was added as indicated. To manipulate [Ca2+]p, total EGTA was increased to 2.6 mm and CaCl2 added to give the indicated [Ca2+]p. [Ca2+]pwas verified using fura-2 (5 μm). Reagents were added to the perfusion buffer as indicated in the figures. InsP3 was perfused in IB containing 75 μm EGTA. To measure [Ca2+]m, the coverslips were placed in a superfusion chamber in close proximity to a photon-counting photomultiplier tube (27Cobbold P.H. Lee J.A.C. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 55-82Google Scholar), the output of which was fed to a computer and analyzed using OSCAR (PTI Inc.) and Excel (Microsoft) software. After each experimental protocol, the cells were perfused with distilled water containing 10 mm Ca2+ to consume all the remaining aequorin. [Ca2+]mwas then calculated from the fractional rate of consumption of the aequorin (28Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Ashley C.C. Campbell A.K. Dectection and Measurement of Free Ca2+ in Cells. Elsevier North Holland, Amsterdam1979: 159-174Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured essentially as described by Lawrieet al. (8Lawrie A.M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Simpson A.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10753-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) using the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A10 cells were grown on 22-mm diameter coverslips, and loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min at 37 °C in PS in the presence of 0.0125% pluronic F127. Coverslips were then placed in a thermostated sample chamber mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. The cells were excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm using a PTI Deltascan illuminator. Emission was monitored using an intensified charge-coupled device (Photonic Science Ltd). The data were subsequently analyzed using PTI Imagemaster software. In intact A10 smooth muscle cells, we found that in the presence of the G-protein-coupled receptor agonist vasopressin, there was a transient increase in [Ca2+]m to 9.9 ± 1.8 μm (n = 13). The increase in [Ca2+]m is much greater than the average increase in [Ca2+]c (2.45 ± 0.7 μm, n = 7) that occurred in the bulk cytosol (30Simpson A.W.M. Ashley C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In cells permeabilized with 10 μm digitonin and in the presence of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, addition of 10 μm InsP3 evoked a similar rise in [Ca2+]m to a mean of 7.6 ± 0.85 μm (n = 23) (Fig.1 a). As seen with other cells, these results suggest that the mitochondria are able to sense Ca2+ released from the InsP3-sensitive channels. When the permeabilized cells were subsequently superfused with a buffer containing ≤500 nm free Ca2+, a [Ca2+]m rise was observed that was comparable to the [Ca2+]p (Fig. 1 a). These results show that, when the free [Ca2+]c is ≤500 nm, the mitochondria in the smooth muscle may sense the mean [Ca2+]c. In contrast, when superfusing permeabilized cells with a buffer containing ≥1 μm free Ca2+, a [Ca2+]m rise was observed that was approximately 3 times greater than [Ca2+]p(Fig. 1 b). In addition, when superfusing these cells with 500 μg/ml heparin, an InsP3 channel inhibitor, the InsP3 response was abolished but heparin had no effect on the large [Ca2+]m response induced by perfusion of 1.5 μm free Ca2+ (Fig.1 c). Likewise, the Ca2+-triggered response remained in permeabilized cells that were refractory to the addition of InsP3 (Fig. 1 d). This rules out the possibility that endogenous generation of InsP3 accounts for the large increase in [Ca2+]m triggered by Ca2+. Collectively, these data indicate that the Ca2+-induced increase in [Ca2+]mis due to some additional process other than InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release. When InsP3 was superfused after obtaining responses to 1.5 or 3 μm[Ca2+]p, the InsP3 response was reduced from 7.4 ± 0.9 μm to 2.35 ± 0.72 μm (n = 6), and from 6.2 ± 1.9 μm to 0.8 ± 0.1 μm (n= 5), respectively, showing that the InsP3 response is substantially reduced after a Ca2+-triggered elevation of [Ca2+]m. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between [Ca2+]m and [Ca2+]p. The data fit a sigmoidal curve. Hence, when [Ca2+]p is around 0.5 μm, [Ca2+]m is the same; when [Ca2+]p is 1.2 μm, the EC50, [Ca2+]m increases to around 5 μm; and when [Ca2+]p is about 3 μm, [Ca2+]m is increased to a mean of about 10 μm. The Hill coefficient is 2.8, indicating a high degree of cooperativity. The line below the sigmoidal curve shows the relationship that would occur if [Ca2+]m reflected exactly [Ca2+]p. Since these responses are reminiscent of CICR, we investigated the effects of caffeine on the elevation of [Ca2+]m. In intact cells with a resting [Ca2+]c of approximately 100 nm(as measured using fura-2; Ref. 30Simpson A.W.M. Ashley C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), 20 mm caffeine caused an elevation in [Ca2+]m to 0.94 ± 0.12 μm (n = 6) when added before vasopressin, and to 1.05 ± 0.06 μm (n = 5) when added immediately after a vasopressin response. In permeabilized cells, 20 mm caffeine in the presence of 200 nmCa2+ triggered a substantial elevation of [Ca2+]m (Fig.3 a). The mean response was 3.85 ± 0.73 μm (n = 5). InsP3 was still effective after this response, indicating that the InsP3-sensitive stores had not been depleted. In the presence of 1 μm Ca2+, 20 mmcaffeine increased [Ca2+]m to 33.8 ± 3.8 μm (n = 4). This potentiation of the CICR response is illustrated in Fig. 3 b. These data imply that not only does caffeine increase the sensitivity of the response but that the amount of Ca2+ available for mitochondrial uptake is increased as well. In order to verify the source of Ca2+ that leads to this large elevation of [Ca2+]m, we investigated the actions of both ryanodine and the integrity of the Ca2+stores on the Ca2+-induced elevation of [Ca2+]m. Addition of 100 μmryanodine had no effect on the peak [Ca2+]mresponse evoked by 10 μm InsP3, but it inhibited the large [Ca2+]m response triggered by Ca2+ buffers (Fig. 3 c). After the addition of ryanodine, [Ca2+]m reflected [Ca2+]p. The data are summarized in Fig.4. We then used two approaches to inhibit the SR Ca2+/ATPase pump and thereby deplete the intracellular stores. In the first we added 2 mmsodium orthovanadate prior to the trigger Ca2+buffer, and in the second we superfused the cells with 1 μm thapsigargin. Under these conditions the increase in [Ca2+]m produced by [Ca2+]p in excess of 1 μmwas equivalent to that superfused (Fig. 4). Similarly, the [Ca2+]m response to InsP3 was completely abolished in the presence of either orthovanadate (n = 6) or thapsigargin (n = 4). Taken together, our results indicate that a CICR gated by RyRs occurs when the permeabilized cells are superfused with appropriate Ca2+ buffers. The RyRs and InsP3Rs are the two main conduits for the regulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in most cells. Although one or the other may be predominant in a specific tissue, some cells such as smooth muscle utilize both. A special relationship between InsP3Rs and mitochondria is now apparent. Although RyRs are abundant in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles in addition to smooth muscles, very little is known about the relationship between mitochondria and Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Our findings indicate that, in conjunction with InsP3Rs, RyRs must also be in close apposition and functionally coupled to mitochondria. When these observations are considered together with earlier findings (5Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 8Lawrie A.M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Simpson A.W.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22385-22390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it suggests that the mitochondria are preferentially located adjacent to specific sources of Ca2+. In intact cells vasopressin produced a large transient elevation of [Ca2+]m, similar to that seen in bovine aortic endothelial and HeLa cells (5Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 7Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). When we subsequently perfused the permeabilized cells with InsP3, we found that it gave a large, rapid and transient rise in [Ca2+]m, with a mean peak rise of around 8 μm. The response, although shorter-lived, was similar to that evoked by vasopressin. Consistent with InsP3 acting at its receptor on the SR, the response is abolished in the presence of heparin, a recognized antagonist of the InsP3 receptor (32Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by orthovanadate and thapsigargin, inhibitors of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump (33Oritz A. Garcı́a-Carmona F. Garcı́a-Canovás F. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Droback B.J. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). The characteristic [Ca2+]m response evoked by a G-protein-coupled agonist as reported here is transient. However, other studies using rhod-2 in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle suggest that the elevation of [Ca2+]m is sustained even when [Ca2+]c declines (25Drummond R.M. Tuft R.A. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy may reflect the different modes of [Ca2+]m measurement, although experiments performed by Hajnoczky et al. (6Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) using rhod-2 in hepatocytes are in broad agreement with aequorin-based measurements. It is important to remember that the relationship between mitochondria and the source of Ca2+ influences the type of [Ca2+]m responses that occur (8Lawrie A.M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Simpson A.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10753-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Additionally, the apparent absence of Na+/Ca2+exchange in the mitochondria of some smooth muscles (35Crompton M. Moser R. Ludi H. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) would certainly explain why sustained [Ca2+]mresponses can be seen in some instances. Transient [Ca2+]m responses occur even though the elevation of Ca2+ in the cytosol is sustained (5Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 7Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). These phasic [Ca2+]m responses are attributed to the formation of microdomains of highly elevated [Ca2+]c adjacent to the source of the Ca2+. Studies based on electron microscopy and fluorescence localization of mitochondria and ER support this hypothesis since they identify areas of close proximity between the two organelles where such microdomains could be generated (8Lawrie A.M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Simpson A.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10753-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Calcium microdomains have been used to not only explain the large amplitude of the [Ca2+]m responses but also their short duration. Diffusion of Ca2+ into the bulk cytosol or re-uptake into intracellular stores will limit the lifetime of the microdomain and therefore the availability of Ca2+ for mitochondrial uptake. The permeabilized cells were superfused with Ca2+/EGTA buffers titrated to give free Ca2+ values close to 500 nm, 1.5 μm, and 3 μm. When [Ca2+]p was around 500 nm, the increase in [Ca2+]m reflected the [Ca2+] in the perfusion buffer. However, when [Ca2+]p was in excess of 1 μm, the increase in [Ca2+]m was substantially higher than [Ca2+]p. These large Ca2+-induced increases in [Ca2+]mwere not abolished by heparin, indicating that the effect is not mediated through any CICR-like process involving the InsP3receptor. The Ca2+-triggered elevation of [Ca2+]m was inhibited by orthovanadate, thapsigargin, and ryanodine. In the presence of any of these agents, [Ca2+]m reflected [Ca2+]p. Caffeine, a known sensitizer of CICR, triggered relatively modest elevation of [Ca2+]m in intact cells (∼1 μm). In permeabilized cells, however, where access is easier and with a trigger [Ca2+] of 200 nm, caffeine elevated [Ca2+]m to nearly 4 μm. When the trigger was 1 μm, [Ca2+]m was increased to around 30 μm in the presence of caffeine. Thus, [Ca2+]p in excess of 1 μm acts as a trigger for Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores; this in turn leads to an elevation of [Ca2+]m that is much greater than [Ca2+]p. The threshold [Ca2+] for CICR-dependent elevation of [Ca2+]m is similar to that measured for CICR in smooth muscle preparations (36Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, classical CICR (37Endo M. Tanaka M. Ogawa Y. Nature. 1970; 228: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) also serves as a trigger for the elevation of [Ca2+]m. These findings have important implications for all tissues containing RyRs. After elevation of [Ca2+]m evoked by CICR, the InsP3 response was significantly reduced. This may be caused by the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool being depleted, or as a result of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the InsP3R. Such inactivation is well known to occur when [Ca2+]c values increases above micromolar (38Bezprozvanni I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). In contrast, we can see that a preceding InsP3-evoked response does not prevent the subsequent CICR-induced [Ca2+]m response, even though prior addition of InsP3 abolishes a second response to InsP3. Heparin does not inhibit the CICR-mediated response, and ryanodine or caffeine do not prevent elevation of [Ca2+]m in response to InsP3. The data imply that InsP3Rs and RyRs do not act in a co-ordinated manner, with Ca2+ release from InsP3Rs neither triggering CICR nor depleting the CICR pool. RyRs are also abundant in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Moreover, myocytes show dynamic (systolic) changes in [Ca2+]m when paced (10Isenberg G. Han S. Schiefer A. Wendt-Gallitelli M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Chacon E. Ohata H. Harper I.S. Trollinger D.R. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Letts. 1996; 382: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since CICR is needed to elevate [Ca2+]c in myocytes, it is reasonable to assume that a function of CICR is to elevate [Ca2+]m, as well as simply providing Ca2+ for the contractile apparatus. The ultrastructure of a myocyte is consistent with such a role. The local depolarizations in Ψm reported by Duchen et al. (24Duchen M.R. Leyssens A. Crompton M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) are attributed to focal release of Ca2+ from the SR. The authors were not certain of the magnitude of the [Ca2+]m responses that underlie these transient changes inΨm. Our evidence shows that CICR can lead to a substantial elevation of [Ca2+]m. Since mitochondria take up Ca2+ as a direct consequence of CICR, it is likely that in turn mitochondria influence the spread of SR Ca2+ release (17Jouaville L.S. Ichas F. Holmuhamedov E.L. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The total uptake of Ca2+ by the mitochondria is calculated to be about 40-fold higher than the increase in free Ca2+ (39Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Thus, by local removal of Ca2+, the mitochondria may restrict the propagation of CICR. Our data reveal that, in addition to the actions of InsP3, Ca2+ release via CICR must also cause the generation of similar Ca2+ microdomains adjacent to mitochondria. It appears that not only can ryanodine-sensitive stores act as a source of Ca2+ for the mitochondria, but that the CICR process may be required to generate a sufficient local increase in [Ca2+]c to enable efficient mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+. The mitochondrial uniporter is recognized as having a low affinity for Ca2+ uptake and therefore a [Ca2+] in excess of the 1–2 μm that is normally found in the bulk cytosol, is needed to generate large increases in [Ca2+]m (peak [Ca2+] 5–10 μm). Although a fast Ca2+ uptake mode has been proposed for the mitochondria (40Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Shen S.S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it is not clear how this might operate in situ. It remains a possibility that the transient nature of the [Ca2+]m response is mediated in part by the activation of a short-lived rapid uptake mode of the uniporter. Predictions by Crompton (41Crompton M. Curr. Top. Membr. Transplant. 1985; 25: 231-239Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and measurements by McCormack et al. (2McCormack J.G. Browne H.M. Dawes N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) suggest that the mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ in excess of the bathing [Ca2+]. Such electrophoretic uptake of Ca2+ is not sufficient to account for the large increases in [Ca2+]m that we observe here, nor can it explain that the elevation of [Ca2+]m in excess of [Ca2+]p is dependent upon the presence of functional Ca2+ stores. It appears therefore that mitochondria are aligned to distinct sources of Ca2+ in a tissue-dependent manner. These sources include Ca2+ influx, InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release, and, as shown here, ryanodine-sensitive CICR. In conclusion we demonstrate that in a cell type that possesses RyRs, CICR plays a crucial role in mitochondrial signal transduction. Since the distribution of RyRs is widespread among many tissues, CICR-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]m is also likely to be widespread. We thank Professor Tullio Pozzan and Drs.

Circulating at micromolar levels, vitronectin participates in the regulation of humoral responses such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the complement cascade (reviewed in Ref. 1Preissner K.T. Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Preissner K.T. Jenne D.

Other functions of the protein that are confined to surfaces or tissues include cell-adhesion and regulation of pericellular proteolysis. Interactions with an assortment of biological molecules are responsible for the multiple functions exhibited by vitronectin. Defining the binding sites for these various biomolecules, along with determining the molecular mechanism of regulation, constitutes an active area of research on the protein. Work to date has focused on binding sites for several ligands, including heparin, PAI-1,1 and integrins; a working model representing the domain structure of vitronectin has been recently reported from this laboratory (5Gibson A.D. Lamerdin J.A. Zhuang P. Baburaj K. Serpersu E.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6432-6442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Arguably, one of the most important interactions known for vitronectin occurs with the serine protease inhibitor, PAI-1. PAI-1 is the physiological inhibitor of plasminogen activators, both tPA and uPA, the enzymes responsible for generating plasmin from its inactive zymogen precursor, plasminogen, and ultimately leading to clot lysis. In addition to contributing to the delicate balance required between coagulation and thrombolysis, PAI-1 plays a role in regulating the proteolytic processes responsible for tissue remodeling and metastasis (6Pollanen J. Stephens R.W. Vaheri A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 273-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although PAI-1 is inherently rather unstable, converting readily from an active to an inactive, latent form, vitronectin binds to PAI-1 and maintains the inhibitor in its active conformation for a longer period of time. Indeed, most circulating PAI-1 is thought to be complexed with vitronectin, so that the complex serves as a reservoir of the physiologically active form of PAI-1 (7Declerck P.J. DeMol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The conversion of active PAI-1 to its latent form is appreciated at the structural level from x-ray crystallographic work by Goldsmith and colleagues (8Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The active-to-latent transition of PAI-1 involves incorporation of a surface-exposed loop containing the reactive center into the central β-sheet of the protein. Using site-directed mutagenesis (9Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (10van Meijer M. Gebbink R.K. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a vitronectin-binding site on the surface of PAI-1 has been localized to residues that lie within the central β-sheet and within adjacent secondary structures. An appealing interpretation of these results is that vitronectin contacts residues on adjacent structures in the vicinity of the central β-sheet of the protein, thus constraining movement of the strands that is necessary for incorporation of the reactive loop into the central β-sheet in latent PAI-1 (9Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The limited freedom of movement of the β-strands to accommodate loop insertion accounts for the slower rate of conversion of PAI-1 to a latent form when complexed with vitronectin.On the other hand, the localization of the binding site for PAI-1 on vitronectin has been more controversial. The PAI-1-binding site has been evaluated using proteolysis, synthetic peptides, and site-directed mutagenesis; however, conclusions from these studies are contradictory (reviewed in Ref. 11Deng G. Royle G. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 44 amino acids (known as the “somatomedin B” region) of the protein are proposed by some groups to constitute the PAI-1-binding site (12Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sigurdardottir O. Wiman B. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recent evidence that indicates this region of the protein is responsible for binding PAI-1 comes from work using isolated recombinant N-terminal fragments from vitronectin that bind and stabilize PAI-1 (14Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis within the recombinant somatomedin B region has identified all 8 cysteines and several other residues within the 44-amino acid stretch as important for binding (15Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Other investigators have identified sequences distal to the N-terminal somatomedin B region to be involved in binding of the serpin. Notably, some have localized PAI-1 binding to the positively charged region of the protein from amino acids 345–379 (16Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol.

Proteases that cleave within the heparin-binding region have been shown to diminish PAI-1 binding to vitronectin, and a recent study demonstrated stabilization of PAI-1 activity in the presence of a synthetic peptide derived from the heparin-binding region (21Gechtman Z. Belleli A. Shaltiel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 339Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Also, Seiffert (22Seiffert D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggests that ligand binding to the C-terminal heparin-binding region regulates the binding of PAI-1 to the N-terminal somatomedin B region. Seiffert and Smith (23Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13705-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) further argue that the N-terminal somatomedin B and cell-binding regions are cryptic in the native structure of vitronectin. Thus, reports in the literature support PAI-1 binding and stabilization via two distinct regions of vitronectin. Although another proposed site for PAI-1-binding consists of residues 115–121 (24Mimuro J. Muramatsu S. Kurano Y. Uchida Y. Ikadai H. Watanabe S. Sakata Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), there is no evidence showing specific stabilization of PAI-1 by interactions with this region of the protein.A major objective of this work was the direct demonstration of the size and stoichiometry of PAI-1·vitronectin complexes. These experiments are important for several reasons: (i) more than one binding site for PAI-1 has been reported on vitronectin; (ii) the binding stoichiometry for the interaction has not been carefully evaluated previously; (iii) a proposal has been made that PAI-1 binding induces self-association of vitronectin (25Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and (iv) formation of the complex alters functional properties and stabilities of the two interacting proteins. Accurate methods for determining molecular weights and stoichiometries are needed to address these issues. In this study, analytical ultracentrifugation was used to directly observe complexes that form in solution. The sedimentation equilibrium method provides accurate determinations of molecular weights for mixtures of interacting components. Monoclonal antibodies for different epitopes on vitronectin provided evidence for two PAI-1-binding sites. The findings expand on the initial observation that PAI-1 promotes association of vitronectin by demonstrating a binding stoichiometry for PAI-1·vitronectin that is not 1:1, as well as a discrete associating species that is formed as the two proteins interact.DISCUSSIONThe fundamental objective of this work was to determine the size and stoichiometry of the PAI-1·vitronectin complex. The technique of analytical ultracentrifugation was selected because it provides a rigorous approach to the measurement of protein molecular weights in solution under equilibrium conditions. Prior to this study, the binding data for PAI-1 and vitronectin had been interpreted assuming a single PAI-1-binding site with a unique affinity. Results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent-type assays that have primarily been used in the past are difficult to reconcile because variable binding affinities are observed, depending on which reactant is immobilized on the plastic surface (42Salonen E.-M. Vaheri A. Pollanen J. Stephens R. Andreasen P. Mayer M. Dano K. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6339-6343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is difficult to estimate stoichiometries of binding from these types of experiments, and attempts to quantify binding stoichiometries have varied from a ratio of 1:1 (PAI-1:vitronectin) with immobilized PAI-1 to a ratio of 1:3 (PAI-1:vitronectin) using immobilized vitronectin (42Salonen E.-M. Vaheri A. Pollanen J. Stephens R. Andreasen P. Mayer M. Dano K. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6339-6343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, a combination of immunoassays using two monoclonal antibodies specific for different epitopes on vitronectin, and the sensitive ultracentrifugation method to evaluate molecular weights of associating systems, has clarified stoichiometry issues and provided a new picture of the PAI-1·vitronectin complex.A Higher Order Complex Is Formed When PAI-1·Vitronectin Complexes AssociateOn first inspection, the sedimentation equilibrium data clearly indicated that a complex other than a simple 1:1 product formed when vitronectin and PAI-1 interact. The molecular weight for the complex was consistently found to equal about 320,000, and the species at equilibrium using equimolar mixtures of vitronectin and PAI-1 clearly included lower molecular weight material (free vitronectin or free latent PAI-1) in addition to the large complex. The ultracentrifuge data also show that at equilibrium there are no detectable intervening molecular weight species that would correspond to potential stable intermediates from the assembly process. Thus, in the time required to achieve sedimentation equilibrium, complex formation appears to go to completion. 2Preliminary sedimentation velocity experiments initiated within minutes of mixing the two proteins suggest the presence of intermediate species. Additional experiments will be required to determine the composition of these intermediates.A great deal of controversy surrounds the issue of PAI-1-binding sites on vitronectin, with sites localized to two distinct regions of vitronectin. The immunochemical studies performed here provide insight into the fundamental reason for the debate, namely that bothof the regions appear to be functional PAI-1-binding sites. The mole ratio of 4:2 PAI-1:vitronectin suggested from the ultracentrifugation experiments was supported by the explicit evaluation of two anti-vitronectin monoclonal antibodies that had given apparently contradictory results in the past regarding PAI-1 binding to vitronectin. The problem had been that independent research groups had used these antibodies to consider only one PAI-1-binding site on vitronectin, residing in the vicinity of one or the other antibody epitope. This study demonstrates that PAI-1 binding to vitronectin occurs simultaneously with either of the antibodies, and PAI-1 binding is fully blocked only if the two binding sites on vitronectin are saturated with both monoclonal antibodies. Thus, the data from this study are consistent with binding of PAI-1 at both sites.A Different Scheme for Association of PAI-1 and Vitronectin Complex Must Be ConsideredAn important result from this study is the demonstration of a higher-order complex that contains molecules of both vitronectin and PAI-1. Although the idea that PAI-1 binding produces multimeric forms of vitronectin has been suggested previously (25Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the possibility that the complex between vitronectin and PAI-1 is not a binary 1:1 species has not been considered or addressed experimentally. This is despite the observation that circulating PAI-1 is quantitatively bound to vitronectin, and that early size-exclusion chromatography on the plasma proteins produced a complex with a molecular weight larger than the 1:1 form (7Declerck P.J. DeMol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multifaceted approach to address the questions of reaction stoichiometry and size of complexes formed by vitronectin and PAI-1 provides a foundation for proposing a model for the composition of the associated complex.A model for the PAI-1·vitronectin complex that assumes binding of PAI-1 at two putative sites on vitronectin is shown in Fig.7. In the model, PAI-1 binding leads to association of vitronectin. The self-association of vitronectin may be favored upon binding of one PAI-1 molecule, or the binding of PAI-1 to both sites may be required before the higher order complex is formed. PAI-1 is stabilized in the complex, although PAI-1 that is not associated rearranges to the latent form at long times. Latent PAI-1 and vitronectin do not interact, so the latent form of the inhibitor accumulates. The low temperature used for these experiments should be noted, as it allowed the observation of the 4:2 complex, with little conversion of PAI-1 to a latent form that would not associate, and with little propensity of the complex to form higher order aggregates that may be favored at higher temperature. The self-associated forms of vitronectin remain intact after conversion of all PAI-1 to the latent form, producing a stable altered form of vitronectin that is multivalent, as previously proposed (25Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under some conditions, even higher order oligomers may form from the 4:2 complex or from the associated vitronectin that remains after PAI-1 is released. Note that aged samples exhibit species of even higher molecular weight that may correspond to higher order aggregates that form after dissociation of the complex and conversion of PAI-1 to a latent form. 3K. H. Minor, M. N. Blackburn, and C. B. Peterson, unpublished observations. The higher order complex observed in the ultracentrifugation experiments supports the hypothesis that PAI-1 binding promotes self-association of vitronectin.At the micromolar protein concentrations used in this work, PAI-1 binds to both sites and gives large complexes. The PAI-1 concentration used experimentally is clearly higher than that in the circulation, which is approximately 0.5 nm. However, the concentration of PAI-1 in either venous or arterial thrombi is several orders of magnitude greater than in the circulation (43Fay W.P. Murphy J.G. Owen W.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1277-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Robbie L.A. Bennett B. Croll A.M. Brown P.A.J. Booth N.A. Thromb.

Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recent immunohistochemical studies suggest that, like PAI-1, vitronectin is concentrated along fibrin fibrils within thrombi in situ (45Robbie L.A. Booth N.A. Brown P.A.J. Bennett B. Arterioscler Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Also, vitronectin and PAI-1 are stored in relatively high concentrations within platelet α-granules, and the majority of vitronectin released upon platelet activation is high in molecular weight and at least partially associated with PAI-1 (48Seiffert D. Schleef R.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 552-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the complexes observed in the ultracentrifugation experiments can readily form in the vicinity of a blood clot. In fact, recent studies by Podor and colleagues (49Podor T.J. Peterson C.B. Lawrence D.A. Stefannson S. Shaughnessy S.G. Foulon D.M. Butcher M. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 19788-19794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar) indicate that vitronectin binds directly to fibrin clots, 4T. J. Podor, J. I. Weitz, and C. B. Peterson, submitted for publication. and the fibrin-associated vitronectin mediates the high-affinity binding of PAI-1 to fibrin.The model in Fig. 7 proposes a physiological means to promote association of vitronectin into higher order species. Similar to the advantage offered by multiple heparin-binding sites on vitronectin, the self-association of vitronectin may aid in binding to other ligands, especially cell surface receptors. Other work has shown that multimeric forms of vitronectin are preferentially endocytosed via integrins in fibroblasts (50Panetti T.S. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11988-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by non-integrin-mediated mechanisms in megakaryocytic cells which target the internalized vitronectin to α-granule structures containing PAI-1 (51Hill S.A. Shaughnessy S.G. Joshua P. Ribau J. Austin R.C. Podor T.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 5061-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, only vitronectin multimers are functional in binding to the uPA receptor (52Kanse S.M. Kost C. Wilhelm O.G. Andreasen P.A. Preissner K.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 53Waltz D.A. Natkin L.R. Fujita R.M. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). PAI-1 may be the physiological stimulus for association of vitronectin to achieve the “clustering” of receptor-binding sites required for biological activity. Vitronectin is a versatile glycoprotein that is found in circulation, in the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells, in platelets, and within various tissues of the human body. Circulating at micromolar levels, vitronectin participates in the regulation of humoral responses such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the complement cascade (reviewed in Ref. 1Preissner K.T. Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305PubMed Google Scholar). Other functions of the protein that are confined to surfaces or tissues include cell-adhesion and regulation of pericellular proteolysis. Interactions with an assortment of biological molecules are responsible for the multiple functions exhibited by vitronectin. Defining the binding sites for these various biomolecules, along with determining the molecular mechanism of regulation, constitutes an active area of research on the protein. Work to date has focused on binding sites for several ligands, including heparin, PAI-1,1 and integrins; a working model representing the domain structure of vitronectin has been recently reported from this laboratory (5Gibson A.D. Lamerdin J.A. Zhuang P. Baburaj K. Serpersu E.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6432-6442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Arguably, one of the most important interactions known for vitronectin occurs with the serine protease inhibitor, PAI-1. PAI-1 is the physiological inhibitor of plasminogen activators, both tPA and uPA, the enzymes responsible for generating plasmin from its inactive zymogen precursor, plasminogen, and ultimately leading to clot lysis. In addition to contributing to the delicate balance required between coagulation and thrombolysis, PAI-1 plays a role in regulating the proteolytic processes responsible for tissue remodeling and metastasis (6Pollanen J. Stephens R.W. Vaheri A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 273-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although PAI-1 is inherently rather unstable, converting readily from an active to an inactive, latent form, vitronectin binds to PAI-1 and maintains the inhibitor in its active conformation for a longer period of time. Indeed, most circulating PAI-1 is thought to be complexed with vitronectin, so that the complex serves as a reservoir of the physiologically active form of PAI-1 (7Declerck P.J. DeMol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of active PAI-1 to its latent form is appreciated at the structural level from x-ray crystallographic work by Goldsmith and colleagues (8Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The active-to-latent transition of PAI-1 involves incorporation of a surface-exposed loop containing the reactive center into the central β-sheet of the protein. Using site-directed mutagenesis (9Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (10van Meijer M. Gebbink R.K. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a vitronectin-binding site on the surface of PAI-1 has been localized to residues that lie within the central β-sheet and within adjacent secondary structures. An appealing interpretation of these results is that vitronectin contacts residues on adjacent structures in the vicinity of the central β-sheet of the protein, thus constraining movement of the strands that is necessary for incorporation of the reactive loop into the central β-sheet in latent PAI-1 (9Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The limited freedom of movement of the β-strands to accommodate loop insertion accounts for the slower rate of conversion of PAI-1 to a latent form when complexed with vitronectin. On the other hand, the localization of the binding site for PAI-1 on vitronectin has been more controversial. The PAI-1-binding site has been evaluated using proteolysis, synthetic peptides, and site-directed mutagenesis; however, conclusions from these studies are contradictory (reviewed in Ref. 11Deng G. Royle G. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 44 amino acids (known as the “somatomedin B” region) of the protein are proposed by some groups to constitute the PAI-1-binding site (12Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

The following secondary antibodies were used for the immunohistochemistry: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Sigma), tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dakopatts), and biotinylated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dakopatts). LC-540, Leydig tumor cells (CCL-43; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 1.0 mmEarle's balanced salt solution, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C on 75-mm plastic bottles. The cells were grown 3 days to confluency, trypsinated, and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min after which the cells were used for Western blotting. The rat lymph nodes were stained for CA activity by the method of Hansson (21.Hansson H.P.J. Histochemie. 1967; 11: 112-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), in which cobalt and phosphorous form a complex at sites of enzyme activity. This complex was converted to a visible, black CoS precipitate using ammonium sulfide. Control stainings were carried out in Hansson's medium in the presence of sodium acetazolamide (Diamox, Lederle Parenterals, Inc., Carolina, Puerto Rico) at a final concentration of 10 μm. After the histochemical staining, the specimens were processed for light microscopy or embedded in Epon, and 66-nm sections were studied using transmission electron microscopy. LC-540 cells grown on plastic chamber slides for microscopy for 3 days were rinsed with 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and fixed with 4% neutral-buffered formaldehyde for 15 min. Then they were rinsed with PBS and subjected to immunofluorescence staining that consisted of the following steps: 1) pretreatment of the cells with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (BSA-PBS) for 40 min and rinsing in PBS, 2) incubation for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in 0.1% BSA-PBS, and 3) incubation with 1:100 diluted fluorescent secondary antibodies in 0.1% BSA-PBS. The cells were washed three times for 10 min after the incubation steps. All incubations and washings were done in the presence of 0.05% saponin. The cells were viewed with a Leitz Aristoplan epifluorescence microscope (Wetzlar, Germany). Samples of the human testis (n = 3) were obtained together with routine histopathological specimens taken during surgical operations for prostate cancer. The procedures were carried out according to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed consent was obtained from each patient. Testis and lymph node specimens were obtained from adult rats of Spraque-Dawley strain. Each tissue sample was divided into several small pieces. The specimens were fixed in Carnoy's fluid (absolute ethanol + chloroform + glacial acetic acid 6:3:1) for 6 h at 4 °C. The samples were then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin wax in a vacuum oven at 58 °C, and sections of 5 μm were placed on gelatin-coated microscope slides. The immunohistochemical staining was performed using the biotin-streptavidin complex method employing the following steps: 1) pretreatment of the sections with undiluted cow colostral whey for 40 min and rinsing in PBS, 2) incubation for 1 h or overnight (testis samples) with the primary antiserum diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA-PBS, 3) incubation for 1 h with biotinylated swine anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:300 in 1% BSA-PBS, 4) incubation for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dakopatts) diluted 1:600 in PBS, 5) incubation for 2 min in DAB solution containing 9 mg of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in 15 ml of PBS + 5 μl of 30% H2O2. The sections were washed three times for 10 min in PBS after incubation steps 2, 3, and 4. All the incubations and washings were carried out at room temperature, and the sections were finally mounted in Permount (Fisher). The stained sections were examined and photographed with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope (Wetzlar, Germany). Rat tissues were homogenized by Ultra-Turrax homogenizer and sonicated in ice-cold 0.1m Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 8.7, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm o-phenanthroline as protease inhibitors. The cell and tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were recovered and subjected to affinity purification. The inhibitor affinity chromatography was performed using the carboxymethyl Bio-Gel A coupled to p-aminomethylbenzenesulfonamide as described (22.Parkkila S. Kaunisto K. Rajaniemi L. Kumpulainen T. Jokinen K. Rajaniemi H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Samples of homogenized rat testis (20 μg), LC-540 cells (20 μg), or eluted protein from inhibitor affinity chromatography (2 or 10 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). All the reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad or Sigma. The electrophoreses were performed in a Mini-Protean electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad) using a 10% acrylamide separating gel and a 4% acrylamide stacking gel. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore; Bedford, MA) in a Novex Blot Module (Novex; San Diego, CA). After the transblotting, the sample lanes were first incubated with TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% cow colostral whey for 30 min and then with the first antibody diluted 1:2000 in TBST buffer for 1 h. The membranes were washed five times for 5 min with TBST buffer and incubated for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:3000 in TBST buffer. After washing four times for 5 min in TBST buffer, the polypeptides were visualized by a chemiluminescence substrate (Bio-Rad). All the steps were carried out at room temperature. The protein sequencing for tryptic-digested polypeptides was carried out with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) followed by analysis with ProFound and PeptideSearch programs. The work was performed in the HHMI Biopolymer/W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. The coding region of nonO with a six-histidine tag at the N terminus was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and cloned into the transfer vector of the BAC-BAC system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Baculoviral DNA containing nonO integrated into the polyhedron gene was isolated fromEscherichia coli strain DH10BAC and transfected into sf9 insect cells (9 × 105 cells). Large scale protein expression was generated by infecting the nonO-containing virus at high multiplicity of infection into insert cells incubated at 27 °C for 72 h. Infected cells were harvested, resuspended in HK buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 15 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitor; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), lysed by sonication, and then centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with HK buffer and then eluted with elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 250 mm imidazole, protease inhibitor). The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer D and stored at −70 °C in aliquots. The purity of the preparations was estimated by SDS-PAGE to exceed 90%. CA activity from recombinant nonO protein was determined as described previously (24.Maren T.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1960; 130: 26-29PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Sundaram V. Rumbolo P. Grubb J. Strisciuglio P. Sly W.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 38: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar). CA activity unit was calculated using the following formula: (uncatalyzed time − catalyzed time)/catalyzed time. The specific activity was represented as CA activity units/mg of purified protein. Sulfonamide-Affi-Gel 10 resin (200 μl) was washed and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 7.5. 7 μg of nonO protein alone or together with 7 μg of purified human CA II was mixed with equilibrated affinity resin in absence or presence of 2 mm acetazolamide at 4 °C for 30 min. Unbound protein was recovered after centrifugation. After two washes with 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 7.5, bound protein was eluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m sodium perchlorate in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6. Eluted proteins were concentrated, and perchlorate was dialyzed out on Centricon tubes using 10 mm Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 7.5. Unbound and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Fig. 1, Aand B, shows immunohistochemical staining of human and rat testis using anti-human and anti-rat CA II antibodies. Strong cytoplasmic and nuclear signals were localized to the interstitial cells. Control immunostaining of rat testis using normal rabbit serum instead of the anti-CA II antibodies is shown in Fig. 1 C. Double immunostaining of rat testis using anti-human CA II and anti-rat P450c17 (a marker of testosterone synthesis) antibodies showed positive signals in the same cells (Fig. 1 F), indicating that the CA expression is confined to the testosterone-producing Leydig cells. Immunocytochemical staining of Leydig cell tumor-derived cells (LC-540) using anti-CA II antibodies also indicated that these cells contain CA immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, D and E). The control immunostaining of LC-540 cells using normal rabbit serum showed no positive reaction (data not shown). Immunoblots from homogenates of rat testis and LC-540 cells were performed to confirm the specificity of the immunostaining results. Anti-rat CA II antibodies recognized a prominent polypeptide migrating at 66 kDa in both blots. In addition, a 30-kDa polypeptide of CA II was visible in the testis (Fig.2). To determine the distribution pattern of the apparent 66-kDa protein and its binding to CA inhibitor affinity chromatography matrix, soluble proteins from several rat tissues were subjected to affinity purification and analyzed by Western blotting. The strongest signal was detected in the liver, colon, ovary, and spleen (Fig.3 A). In all other tissues examined the signal became apparent after longer exposures (data not shown). In another set of experiments (Fig. 3 B) both anti-human and anti-rat CA II antibodies revealed a strong 66-kDa signal in addition to the 30-kDa polypeptide of CA II in affinity-purified proteins from rat lymph nodes. To identify the apparent 66-kDa protein observed in the Western blots, the corresponding band was isolated from a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after transblotting and subjected to protein sequencing. The sequence data obtained from MALDI-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry) was analyzed using ProFound and PeptideSearch data bases, which revealed that the protein was identical to murine nonO and its human orthologue, p54nrb. Although the predicted mass of nonO/p54nrb is 55 kDa, its mobility in SDS-PAGE was previously estimated at 65 kDa. Thus the 66-kDa protein of nonO/p54nrb corresponds to the conventional ubiquitous form. The percentage coverage of the known sequence for this protein was 33% as shown in Fig. 4. The results in Fig.5 A show that recombinant nonO alone as well as in presence of human CA II bound to thep-aminomethylbenzenesulfonamide-coupled Affi-Gel-10 column. High molecular weight polypeptides for nonO seen in the bound fraction represent larger sizes of recombinant nonO as observed earlier (17.Yang Y.-S. Hanke J.H. Carayannopoulos L. Craft C.M. Capra J.D. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 2 mm acetazolamide completely prevented the binding of both nonO and CA II to the column, suggesting that the binding properties of nonO and CA II are quite similar and that nonO may also contain CA enzymatic activity. The latter expectation was realized by a CA activity assay. The specific CA activity of recombinant nonO was 25 units/mg. The comparison of specific activities of different CA isozymes is given in Table I. The specific activity of nonO was higher than determined for CA III and VA and similar to CA VI. All other CA isozymes were 10- to 100-fold more active than nonO protein.Table IComparison of specific CA activity of different isozymesIsozymeSpecific activityunits/mgCA I200CA II2000–3000CA III1–5CA IV3000CA VA5CA VI30CA IX2000CA XII500CA XIV2000The specific CA activity of nonO/p54nrb was 25 units/mg. Open table in a new tab The specific CA activity of nonO/p54nrb was 25 units/mg. NonO alone or together with human CA II was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-nonO or anti-CA II antibodies (Fig. 5, Band C). Anti-nonO serum recognized the recombinant nonO protein (panel B, lanes 1 and 3) and also showed a weak reaction with CA II (lane 3). Anti-nonO antibody recognized polypeptides of 66 and 53 kDa, similar to nonO protein in the partially purified CAs from rat lymph node (lane 2). The results in Fig. 5 C show that anti-CA II antibody cross-reacted with the recombinant nonO protein as shown inlanes 1 and 3. A strong reaction with CA II protein was seen as expected (lane 3). A polypeptide similar to CA II was seen in the partially purified CAs from rat lymph node (lane 2). From these results we conclude that anti-nonO antibodies cross-react with CA II and vice versa, suggesting an immunological similarity between these proteins. The failure to detect CA II (panel B, lane 2) and nonO (panel C, lane 2) was due to low amount of CA II and nonO protein in the partially purified CA preparation obtained from rat lymph nodes. In addition, the immunological cross-reactivity between α-nonO and CA II as well as α-CA II and nonO is much weaker than the specific binding of these antibodies (compare with lane 3 of panels B and C). The poor immunological cross-reactivity between these two proteins resulted in nondetectable CA II and nonO in panels B (lane 2) and C (lane 2), respectively. Both anti-CA II and anti-nonO antibodies stained lymphocytes in the rat lymph node (Fig. 6). The immunoreaction for the nonO protein was confined to the nuclei (B), whereas anti-CA II serum showed positive signal in both nucleus and cytoplasm (A). The control immunostaining of the rat lymph node using normal rabbit serum instead of the primary antibody was negative (Fig.6 C). These results suggest that lymphocytes may contain both nonO and CA II proteins. Frozen sections of rat lymph node were stained for CA activity using Hansson's histochemical method and analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Fig. 6, D and E, shows that much of the black reaction product is localized to the nuclei of lymphocytes, indicating that these cells express nuclear CA activity. 10 μm acetazolamide completely blocked the reaction as shown in Fig. 6 F. As a first step to identify the CA isozyme(s) expressed in Leydig cells, we used antibodies against CA II in conjunction with immunohistochemical methods and Western blotting. Interestingly, anti-CA II antibody repeatedly recognized an apparent 66-kDa polypeptide, which was previously thought to be a dimeric form of CA II (19.Parkkila A.-K. Parkkila S. Juvonen T. Rajaniemi H. Histochemistry. 1993; 99: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since reduction by β-mercaptoethanol did not dissociate this polypeptide and the same molecular weight band was obtained by CA inhibitor affinity chromatography from several tissues, the 66-kDa polypeptide was considered as a promising candidate for a novel CA isozyme. Amino acid sequencing revealed, however, that it was previously cloned and characterized as nonO/p54nrb, a nuclear protein shown to bind both RNA and DNA and be implicated in transcription and pre-RNA splicing (17.Yang Y.-S. Hanke J.H. Carayannopoulos L. Craft C.M. Capra J.D. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18.Dong B. Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This finding is provocative because no other class of mammalian proteins except CAs has been shown to bind specifically to a CA inhibitor affinity chromatography matrix and to contain CA catalytic activity. The present results showed significant immunological cross-reactivity between CA II and nonO. A polyclonal anti-rat CA II antibody recognized recombinant nonO in Western blots. Conversely, polyclonal anti-nonO serum raised against a bacterial glutathioneS-transferase-nonO fusion protein cross-reacted with purified CA II. One explanation for this cross-reactivity is the minor sequence homology found between CA II and nonO (Fig. 4). In addition to the immunological similarity with CA II, the nonO protein was found to be an enzymatically active CA. Its specific activity is similar to CA VI 2A. Waheed and W. S. Sly, unpublished observation.and higher than determined for CA III (11.Jeffery S. Carter N.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 66: 439-441Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and CA VA.2Since these isozymes have been reported to participate in various physiological processes, we can predict that the level of CA activity in nonO is also physiologically meaningful. The amino acid sequence of nonO predicted from its cDNA shares no structural elements required for conventional CA activity. All conserved histidines, which are involved in zinc binding and heretofore have been considered essential for CA activity, are absent in nonO. Interestingly, Lesburg et al. (26.Lesburg C.A. Huang C. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15780-15791Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrate that CA activity and zinc binding capacity of CA II is retained when His-119 is substituted with glutamine. A polyglutamine stretch, Q-29–Q-38, in the nonO protein is a potential site for Zn2+ binding and could be a potential site for the CA activity of nonO. It will be of interest to explore the tertiary structure of nonO and compare it with other CAs. This could give some clues to explain the nature of the CA activity in the nonO protein. NonO is a nucleic acid-binding protein that shares significant sequence identity with NonA, a Drosophila optomotor protein of unknown function (17.Yang Y.-S. Hanke J.H. Carayannopoulos L. Craft C.M. Capra J.D. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18.Dong B. Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and with PSF, a mammalian splicing factor (18.Dong B. Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate a direct or indirect role for nonO in transcription. First, Yang et al. (27.Yang Y.-S. Yang M.-C.W. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2284-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) show that nonO enhances the binding of some conventional sequence-specific transcription factors (Oct-2, E47) to their recognition sites, suggesting that nonO protein might be a positive co-activator. Second, nonO has been independently implicated as a transcription factor in at least three systems. The murine intracisternal A particle provirus elements are expressed at low levels in undifferentiated F9 embryonic carcinoma cells but highly when F9 cells are induced to differentiate into ectoderm. Intracisternal A particle up-regulation requires a 60-kDa DNA-binding protein (28.Kamat J.P. Basu A. Satyamoorthy K. Xu M.Q. Showe L. Howe C.C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 29.Lamb B.T. Satyamoorthy K. Solter D. Basu A. Xu M.Q. Weinmann R. Howe C.C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hepatic and intestinal transcription of the human apolipoprotein A-II gene requires several nuclear activities at the apolipoprotein A-II promoter (31.Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these turns out to be nonO. 3P. Cardot, personal communication. NonO binds and appears to transactivate the core promoter of the hepatocyte growth factor gene. 4R. Zarnegar, personal communication. In these cases, identity was established by protein purification followed by in vitro transcription. The third line of evidence is provided by heteromeric analyses. Three known transcription factors have been found in complexes with nonO. Hallier et al. (32.Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) identify nonO by microsequencing as a partner for Spi-1, a DNA target-specific transactivator involved in erythrocyte differentiation. Dr. John Hassell (Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) identified nonO in the same manner as a 65-kDa protein copurifying with the Ets-domain member, PEA3 (33.Xin J.-H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). PEA3 is a developmentally-regulated transcriptional activator of unknown function primarily expressed in brain and epididymis. We demonstrated that the respective recombinant proteins interact but without obvious consequence for PEA3 DNA binding (27.Yang Y.-S. Yang M.-C.W. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2284-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Finally in a standard two-hybrid screen of a gal4 activation domain-fused cDNA library, we isolated a third partner, the retinoic X receptor (RXR) chain of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. 5C.-J. Huang and P. W. Tucker, unpublished information. Preliminary observations indicate that nonO can repress nuclear hormone mediated transcriptions through interaction with its DNA binding domain. Our results provide both physiologic and an expanded significance for the CA activity of nonO in transcriptional regulation. We propose that a common and fundamental property underlies this unique diversity. As an active CA, nonO might participate in pH-dependent events occurring in the nucleus. These might include protein transport, ion gradients, or apoptosis. We thank Dr. Michael R. Waterman for providing the antibody against rat P450c17.

https://openalex.org/W1526783183,"HKT1 is a high affinity K+ transporter protein that is a member of a large superfamily of transporters found in plants, bacteria, and fungi. These transporters are primarily involved in K+ uptake and are energized by Na+ or H+. HKT1 is energized by Na+ but also mediates low affinity Na+ uptake and may therefore be a pathway for Na+ uptake, which is toxic to plants. The aim of this study was to identify regions of HKT1 that are involved in K+/Na+ selectivity and alter the amino acid composition in those regions to increase the ionic selectivity of the transporter. A highly charged loop was identified, and two deletions were created that resulted in the removal of charged and uncharged amino acids. The functional changes caused by the deletions were studied in yeast and Xenopus oocytes. The deletions improved the K+/Na+ selectivity of the transporter and increased the salt tolerance of the yeast cells in which they were expressed. In light of recent structural models of members of this symporter superfamily, it was necessary to determine the orientation of this highly charged loop. Introduction of an epitope tag allowed us to demonstrate that this loop faces the outside of the membrane where it is likely to facilitate the interaction with cations such as K+ and Na+. This study has identified an important structural feature in HKT1 that in part determines its K+/Na+ selectivity. Understanding the structural basis of the functional characteristics in transporters such as HKT1 may have important implications for increasing the salt tolerance of higher plants."

Crystal structures of members of the first three families are now available, clearly showing evolutionarily distinct folds. These nonrelated folds share, however, surprising similarities when comparing their heme binding sites, possibly reflecting the minimum structural requirements for stable gas binding through heme ligation. Cytochrome c molecules that, in contrast to the former heme proteins, have covalently linked heme prosthetic groups are without any doubt another evolutionarily independent fold primarily adapted as an electron carrier. A novel cytochrome c, which transiently binds O2during autooxidation, was discovered in the purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and was designated SHP1 (Sphaeroides heme protein) (11.Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This protein was shown to contain a single high spin heme with a redox potential of −22 mV and a mass of 12.5 kDa. The protein is not homologous to any of the above mentioned gas-binding heme proteins. The amino acid sequence actually indicates a distant relationship to the class I cytochromes c (12.Klarskov K. Van Driessche G. Backers K. Dumortier C. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5995-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SHP has a high spin heme, indicating lack of a strong field sixth ligand, which confers to SHP spectral properties similar to those of the globins and of cytochromes c′. Unlike the cytochromes c′, SHP binds molecular oxygen as demonstrated by the absence of isosbestic points and the formation of a new transient spectral species during autooxidation. The half-life of the SHP-oxygen complex was determined to be 3 min (12.Klarskov K. Van Driessche G. Backers K. Dumortier C. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5995-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which is a dramatic difference to the observed half-life of approximately 1 day for the myoglobin-oxygen complex (13.Brown W.D. Mebine L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6696-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHP is substantially less reactive with exogenous ligands than myoglobin. It is also less reactive with reducing agents, suggesting that the heme environment is sterically hindered. The absorption spectrum of reduced SHP is perturbed by Tris, Hepes, Bis-Tris-Propane, and other nitrogenous bases (11.Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are bound to the protein but not as heme ligands. SHP-like oxygen-binding heme proteins have been found inChromatium vinosum (14.Gray G.O. Gaul D.F. Knaff D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 22: 83-86Google Scholar) and Rhodocyclus gelatinosus. 2T. E. Meyer, unpublished observations. Both proteins are cytochromes c and transiently bind oxygen in a similar manner as SHP. Recently, cytochrome c“ from the obligate methylotroph Methylophilus methylotrophus was shown to be 32% identical to SHP (15.Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16.Klarskov K. Leys D. Backers K. Costa H.S. Santos H. Guisez Y. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 26: 47-55Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and a 42% identical open reading frame is present in the genome of the metal oxide-reducing bacteriumShewanella putrefaciens (Fig.1). These observations indicate a more widespread occurrence of SHP-like cytochromes in bacteria than previously thought. We have determined the crystal structure of SHP, unliganded and liganded, in both redox states to determine the molecular basis for its unusual properties. X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E-9 spectrometer as described according to Von Wachenfeldtet al. (17.Von Wachenfeldt C. De Vries S. Van der Oost J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). SHP was purified as described previously (11.Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) except for an additional purification step using hydroxylapatite. Crystals in space group I222 (a = 83.3 Å, b = 103.8 Å, c = 113.6 Å) were grown by vapor diffusion from 3.1 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. The deep brown color of the crystals indicated the protein remained in a high spin oxidated state. Heavy metal derivatives were prepared by soaking native crystals in the mother liquor containing the appropriate concentration of the heavy metal compound. Crystals were reduced and mounted in an anaerobic glove box by adding sodium dithionite to the mother liquor. Reduction of the crystals resulted in a change in color from dull brown to bright red. Cyanide-liganded SHP crystals were prepared by adding potassium cyanide to the mother liquor, resulting in the same color change as observed for reduced crystals. NO-liganded SHP was prepared by adding potassium nitrite to a reduced crystal, whereby the surplus of dithionite reacted with the nitrite to form NO. Data for the native and each of the heavy metal derivatives as well as for reduced and NO-liganded SHP were collected on a DIPScience 2030 image plate instrument using radiation produced by a rotating copper anode source with a mirror-based monochromator system. High resolution data were collected for the native and the CN complex at the DW32 beamline of the LURE synchrotron (Paris, France). Data were recorded on a MarResearch IP. All data were processed using the DENZO software package (18.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Meth. Enz. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). A major heavy atom site for the platinum chloride derivative was located using a difference Patterson map. The remaining heavy atom positions were determined from self- and cross-difference Fourier maps. The position and the real and anomalous occupancy of all sites were refined using MLPHARE (19.Otwinoski Z. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering 80. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1991Google Scholar) resulting in a figure of merit of 0.67 in the 15–2.9 Å range. The resultant phase information was improved and extended to 2.6 Å by solvent flattening and histogram matching using the DM program (20.Cowtan K. Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) from the CCP4 package (21.CCP4Acta Cryst. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). Resultant electron density maps revealed a connected backbone electron density for the complete molecule. Density for most side chains and for the heme group was also clearly visible, facilitating chain tracing. Positional and B-factor refinement of the initial model were performed with the REFMAC (22.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) program, first using data to 2.6 Å, later using data up to 1.82 Å. This resulted in a final model withR cryst 17.0 and R free20.7 from 15–1.82 Å. A difference Fo-Fc Fourier map, calculated with phases obtained from the oxidized SHP structure showed several portions of positive electron density in the heme vicinity. The position of several side chains was adjusted manually, and the ligands were placed in the electron density in each molecule. The positional and temperature factors were again refined using REFMAC.

Open table in a new tab Coordinates and structure factors of the four SHP structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes: 1DW0 -RCSB010424 oxidized SHP; 1DW1 -RCSB010425, cyanide complexed SHP; 1DW2-RCSB010426, nitric oxide complexed SHP; 1DW3 -RCSB010427, reduced SHP). The ligand-free oxidized SHP structure was determined to 1.82 Å resolution using the method of multiple isomorphous replacement. Three nearly identical copies of the monomeric protein were found in the asymmetric unit, referred to below as SHP1, SHP2, and SHP3. The SHP polypeptide is organized into a series of four α-helices and extended loop structures. Despite little or no sequence similarity, it is clearly structurally related to the class I cytochromes c (Figs. 2 and3).Figure 3Ribbon diagrams of the oxidized SHP structure. Heme is represented in fine bonds, and His47, Asn88, Cys89, and Cys91 have been depicted by ball and sticks. This figure has been generated using the programs MOLSCRIPT (41.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (42.Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The polypeptide chain is wrapped around the prosthetic heme group, with the N- and C-terminal helices interacting. Examples of class I cytochromesc include mitochondrial cytochrome c (23.Bushnell G.W. Louie G.V. Brayer G.D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), the two domains of the Pseudomonas stutzeri diheme cytochromec 4 (24.Kadziola A. Larsen S. Structure. 1997; 5: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the Azotobacter vinelandii cytochrome c 5 (25.Carter D.C. Melis K.A. O'Donell S.E. Burgess B.K. Furey Jr., W.R. Wang B.C. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Comparison of SHP to these cytochromes, by superimposing the heme groups, clearly indicates how the first α-helix in SHP (Ser4-Gly17) is an extra N-terminal extension to the class I fold as was previously suggested (12.Klarskov K. Van Driessche G. Backers K. Dumortier C. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5995-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This helix is packed against the C-terminal or fourth helix (Gly100-Gly112) with an inclination of about 20°. Besides this predominantly hydrophobic packing, it is tied to the third α-helix (Asp77-Ile93) by virtue of a strong hydrogen bond between the phenol group of Tyr12and the side chain of Glu82. The second and fourth α-helices of SHP, with the interspersed heme binding motive, superimpose on the N- and C-terminal helices and the heme binding motive of the second domain of the P. stutzeri diheme. A 1.5 Å root mean square deviation for 40 Cα atoms with a Z score of 3.0 was obtained using the program DALI (26.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). Four conserved positions in cytochrome c (Gly-Ala6, Phe-Tyr10, Leu-Val-Phe94, and Tyr-Trp-Phe97 (mitochondrial cytochrome cnumbering)) are mainly responsible for the interaction between the two helices. These residues are not involved in heme binding, and their conservation is suggested to be an indication of their critical structural importance in folding (27.Ptitsyn O.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In SHP, the packing between helices 2 and 4 is formed by interaction of Gly25 and Phe29 in the N-terminal helix with Leu105 and Trp108 in the C-terminal helix. It is noteworthy that the two SHP homologs for which the sequence is known contain this sequence signature. Furthermore, the relative orientation of helices two and four is stabilized in SHP by a strong salt bridge formed between Arg24 and Asp104. The SHP region containing the sixth heme ligand and part of the cystine bridge is very different in comparison to the classical cytochromec fold. In SHP, this entire region is folded in one slightly bent α-helix (Asp77-Ile93) oriented parallel to the heme plane. The charged Glu82 side chain forms a strong hydrogen bond to Tyr12 and a salt bridge with Lys102, thus effectively tying the beginning of this helix to both the first and the last α-helix. These residues are conserved in the known SHP-like sequences, which underlies the importance of this structural feature. Another feature that is conserved in these three proteins is Cys89, situated near the end of helix 3, which is covalently linked to the conserved Cys97 that precedes the C-terminal helix 4. In SHP, the loop between these cysteines also interacts with the C-terminal helix by virtue of a salt bridge between Arg95 and Glu101. We believe that the positional restraint of the third helix at both ends serves to prevent the binding of large molecules such as imidazole to the heme, a process that would require local reorganization of the backbone conformation. The slightly saddle-shaped heme group is mainly situated in the hydrophobic interior of the protein and is ligated to His47(2.14 Å for the Fe-His bond) on the proximal side. The imidazole group is wedged in a hydrophobic pocket lining the proximal heme face. This pocket is formed by the side chains of residues Phe29, Val51, Ile63, Leu66, and Leu109. The imidazole moiety is restrained through a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen atom of Ala64. Space for the internal water molecule is provided by the lack of a side chain at conserved residue Gly55. This ligation is unlike typical class I cytochromes where the peptide carbonyl of a conserved Pro residue (Pro30 in mitochondrial cytochrome c) provides the hydrogen bond partner for the histidine. Water as a hydrogen bonding partner to the histidine N1 has been reported for some of the heme groups in tetraheme cytochromes (28.Higuchi Y. Kusunoki M. Matsuura Y. Yasuoka N. Kakudo M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,29.Matias P.M. Morais J. Coelho R. Carrondo M.A. Wilson K. Dauter L. Sieker L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1342-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and it is the hydrogen bonding partner in nitrophorin (5.Weichsel A. Andersen J.F. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Montfort W.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and FixL (3.Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The imidazole aromatic plane forms a dihedral angle of 28° with the N2-Fe-N4 line in SHP, which is far from the ideal value of 45°. This property has likewise been observed in tetraheme cytochromesc (30.Choudhury K. Sundaramoorthy M. Mauro J.M. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25656-25659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Zobrist M La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 1944-1946Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both solvent-exposed heme propionates are stabilized by a salt bridge to the conserved Arg74 and, to a lesser extent, by the more distant Arg80. The electron density at the carboxylate of heme propionate 7 is spherically shaped, which we modeled as two nearly perpendicular conformations. Compared with the proximal side, the distal heme plane is more solvent accessible, a conclusion similar to that based on NMR data for the homologous M. methylotrophus cytochrome c“ (15.Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amino acid providing the sixth heme ligand was found to be Asn88. An amide group as sixth heme ligand has not been reported until now, although amide has been observed for the fifth ligand His175-Gln mutant of yeast CCP (30.Choudhury K. Sundaramoorthy M. Mauro J.M. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25656-25659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Asn88 in the Shewanellaprotein is conserved, whereas in the cytochrome c” ofM. methylotrophus it is replaced by a histidine (Fig. 1). Based on our crystallographic data, we cannot discern which atom, whether the oxygen carbonyl or the amide nitrogen, is actually ligating the Fe(III) atom at a distance of 2.2 Å. EPR spectroscopy on the oxidized SHP was done to search for spectral features that could help in the assignment of either O or N as the coordinating atom of the axial asparagine. In the case of N coordination the I = 1 nuclear spin of nitrogen should give rise to a splitting of the EPR line mainly in the z-direction. Alternatively, if a finite fraction of the Fe(III) heme exists in the low spin form, then the three g values can be indicative for a particular axial coordination. However, only a high spin ferric heme with g values of 1.999 and 5.898 was detected by EPR with no indication of ligand splitting (data not shown). Therefore, the experiment does not discriminate between the two possible binding modes for Asn. The only positive conclusion that can be drawn is that EPR indicates an unusually high degree of homogeneity of the Fe(III) heme prosthetic group. Based on both the mutant CCP structure (30.Choudhury K. Sundaramoorthy M. Mauro J.M. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25656-25659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the observation that heme forms high spin bis-oxygen-ligated complexes in Me2SO or N,N-dimethylformamide (31.Zobrist M La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 1944-1946Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we modeled the ligating atom to be the oxygen. The oxygen is situated in a hydrophobic pocket, which is formed mainly by Trp84 and Leu85. The Trp84 aromatic plane is oriented parallel to the heme plane and appears to be in electronic interaction with pyrrole group III of the heme. The second atom of the amide group, modeled as the nitrogen, is restrained through a water-mediated hydrogen bond to both the hydroxyl group of Ser91 and a sulfate ion, a hydrogen bonding pattern that does not indicate whether the noncoordinated atom is either an H-bond acceptor (the oxygen) or donor (the nitrogen). The bound sulfate ion is clearly present in SHP1, stabilized not only by the water-mediated hydrogen bond to Asn88 but also forming a salt bridge with Arg87. This structural feature is less clear in molecules SHP2 and SHP3, with marginal electron densities for both the sulfate ion and the Arg side chain. All mitochondrial cytochromes c and bacterial cytochromesc 2 have predominantly positively charged residues in the region of the exposed heme edge. This site has been implicated as the interaction site for redox proteins carrying a complementary negative charge (32.Meyer T.E. Watkins J.A. Przysiecki C.T. Tollin G. Cusanovich M.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4761-4767Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As was already demonstrated (12.Klarskov K. Van Driessche G. Backers K. Dumortier C. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5995-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), SHP carries a positive charge of approximately +3 at the site of reduction. The conserved residues Lys61, Arg80, and Arg87 are clearly responsible for this concentrated positive charge at the exposed heme edge. There is only one negative charge at the edge of the heme, in addition to the heme propionates, provided by Asp39. The opposite side of the protein is predominantly negative, conferring a net dipole moment to the molecule. As a first step toward understanding ligand binding, we have determined the structure of reduced SHP. Upon reduction, Asn88 no longer ligates the iron. The amide group swings away from the heme by 1.0 Å, whereas the iron moves toward the remaining His47 ligand by 0.3 Å, enlarging the Fe2+ amide distance to 3.0 Å and making the iron penta-coordinated (Fig. 4). In this process, a water molecule and the bound sulfate ion are ejected from the hydration core. This redox-dependent behavior has likewise been observed for the histidine ligand of the M. methylotrophus cytochrome c“ (33.Santos H. Turner D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 277-286Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Upon reduction of cytochrome c”, the iron changes from hexa- to pentacoordination, with a concomitant change in spin state and a dramatic increase in the pK a of the τ-nitrogen of the histidine, resulting in a redox-Bohr effect. Neither effect has been observed for SHP. This is because of the fact that its Asn88 amide is unable to force the iron III into a low spin state and because Asn88 does not possess a readily protonatable group. A redox labile heme ligand has also been observed in cytochrome cd 1-nitrate reductase, where Tyr25 only coordinates the d1 heme in the oxidized state (34.Williams P.A. Fulop V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This observation explains the fact that the redox potential of SHP is different for the reductive (−20 mV) and the oxidative (−54 mV) reaction (11.Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Structural investigation of the oxygen complex is technically difficult as it has too short a life time to be studied by conventional crystallographic methods. As a further step toward understanding the nature of oxygen binding, we have determined the structure of the oxidized SHP-CN complex, cyanide being a ligand isosteric to oxygen. Unlike cyanide, however, oxygen has a preference for bonding at an angle <180° (Fig. 5). Comparison of the SHP-CN complexed form and the oxidized structure shows distinct changes in the vicinity of the distal heme pocket (Fig.6). The CN-Fe3+ distance of 1.9 Å is in good agreement with the distance observed in other cyanide-complexed hemeproteins. The amide side chain of Asn88 is pushed aside by a distance of 2.6 Å and forms a weak hydrogen bond (3.1 Å) to the new ligand. This movement results in expulsion of the bound sulfate ion as well as of the water molecule, similar to what occurs in the reduction process. In contrast to the observed linear ligand geometry of unhindered metal cyanide complexes, the cyanide is oriented at an Fe-C-N angle of 155°. This is probably because of the close contact with the backbone oxygen of Trp84 (3.1 Å). Compared with the unliganded oxidized structure, this atom is shifted out of the heme pocket by 0.8 Å realigning the local backbone conformation. The realignment results in adaptation of the entire distal heme pocket to the ligand, moving the side chain of Leu85 by 1.1 Å into the heme pocket and slightly reorientating the imidazole plane of Trp84. The distal cavity is further deformed by displacement of several heme atoms toward the proximal side, resulting in a severely distorted heme conformation. The considerable distortion of the distal pocket and the observation of the destabilizing contact with the backbone can explain the considerable higher K d of ligand binding for both cyanide and azide, compared with the values for myoglobin (35.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. Elsevier North Holland, New York1971Google Scholar).Figure 6Distortion caused by binding of cyanide.Stereoview of the heme pocket of the oxidized structure.

The penultimate PheCD1 of the globin fold coincides with the six-membered ring of the Trp84 indole, whereas Val E11 and Gln E7 take similar positions as Leu85 and Asn88 of SHP. The fixL protein retains this tridentate grip on the ligand but uses a hydrophobic residue at each position. This is somewhat like theGlycera dibranchiata hemoglobin, where a Leu replaces the more common His at position E7 (37.Braden B.C. Arents G. Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to the former three proteins, nitrophorin is a nitric oxide-transporting protein, which has a slightly larger and more solvent accessible heme pocket. The pocket is composed of two leucines, leaving the third position open for a water molecule. Taking into account the natural variance at positions E7 and E11 in the globin heme pocket, together with the structure of the heme pockets of SHP and FixL, it can be stated that the minimal requirement for stable oxygen binding to a heme group is the creation of a mainly hydrophobic pocket, shielding the ligand from water. From a topological point of view, this is probably only possible when at least three residues are involved, as in the observed tridentate conformation. Minimal differences in the exact nature, shape, and accessibility would then account for major changes in oxygen affinity and stability of the complex. It is interesting to note that whereas the Shewanella SHP homolog has mainly identical or similar active site residues, the M. methylotrophus cytochromec“ has a Glu instead of Trp84. To our knowledge, a stable oxygen complex could not be detected for cytochromec”, consistent with our reasoning that the heme pocket is too solvent accessible and hydrophilic in this case. An explanation remains to be given for the marked difference in stability of the oxygen complex of SHP when compared with that of the globins. Comparing the x-ray structures, the cyanide ligands are equally well shielded from the solvent in both SHP and elephant myoglobin. A feature that might destabilize the SHP oxygen complex when compared with the globin complex is the close proximity of the backbone oxygen of Trp84. As mentioned above, this atom is in unfavorable Van der Waals contact with the cyanide ligand and could therefore destabilize the oxygen complex. The other oxygen binding heme proteins avoid such steric hindrance by creating the tridentate grip with three nonadjacent residues. To investigate whether contact with the backbone near Trp84 might indeed perturb the oxygen complex, we determined the structure of the nitric oxide complex of SHP. In contrast to the cyanide ion, nitric oxide is a single electron donor, just as oxygen is. It is therefore expected to coordinate iron in a similar way as oxygen. The crystal structure of the NO-liganded SHP establishes that the NO molecule (with an N-Fe2+distance of 1.8 Å) is oriented at a Fe-N-O angle of 112°, as observed in other NO-binding heme proteins (38.Brucker E.A Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Phillips Jr, G.N. Proteins. 1998; 30: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). In comparison to the perturbation caused by the ligation of cyanide, the readjustment of the backbone compared with the uncomplexed oxidized form is insignificant. A close contact with the oxygen of Trp84, however, is not avoided as the oxygen atom of nitric oxide is located at a distance of 3.1 Å. We conclude from the above that the small, rigid SHP heme pocket could have evolved to select for a small ligand containing a hydrogen bond donor bound to the ligating atom, such as hydroxylamine, hydrazine, or hydrogen peroxide. Such a molecule would be stabilized by an additional hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of Trp84. It has indeed been observed that hydroxylamine forms a low spin complex with reduced SHP.2 In S. putrefaciens MR-1, an SHP homolog appears to be part of an electron transfer pathway because the SHP gene is associated with the genes for a membrane-spanning cytochrome b and a diheme cytochromec, homologous to the R. sphaeroides diheme cytochrome c (39.Vandenberghe I. Leys D. Demol H. Van Driessche G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13075-13081Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The R. sphaeroides diheme cytochrome c has a lower redox potential than does SHP, which suggests that it is the natural electron donor for SHP. The redox potential of the cytochrome b is unknown, but it could supply electrons to the diheme cytochrome c. The observation that in Methylophilus methylotrophus (40.Price N.J. Vijgenboom E. Ribeiro G. Costa J.V. Canters G.W. Santos H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) this cytochrome b gene, and in Rb. sphaeroidesboth a similar cytochrome b and the diheme cytochromec gene, 3K. Backers, unpublished observations. are associated with the SHP gene indeed suggests the presence of a conserved electron transfer pathway involving SHP as possible terminal electron acceptor. It would seem from the present structural study that SHP can reduce a small ligand like peroxide or hydroxylamine. The resultant product would then be displaced from the iron coordination sphere by the religation of the sixth heme ligand as is observed in cytochrome cd 1-nitrite reductase (34.Williams P.A.

Arthropods trigger primary hemostasis by damaging blood vessels while probing the skin. As platelet aggregation is fundamental to hemostasis, some hematophagous arthropods appear to have evolved the ability to secrete platelet inhibitors in their saliva. Previous reports of antiplatelet activity in arthropod saliva include findings of prostacyclin activity in ticks (1.Dickinson R.G. O'Hagan J.E. Schotz M. Binnington K.C. Hegarty M.P. Aust. J. Exp.

Parker K.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1981; 48: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); and a nitrosylheme protein from Rhodnius prolixus that has the capacity to release nitric oxide (7.Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M.H. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Other than the protein from Rhodnius, these antiplatelet activities have not been well characterized, and it is not clear whether these or other activities account for the platelet inhibitory activity found in salivary gland lysates. Deerflies (genus Chrysops), also referred to as “greenheads” because of their brilliant green eyes, frequent the coast of the northeastern United States for several weeks in midsummer. Because these flies inflict painful bites that sometimes bleed, we reasoned that deerfly salivary gland extract (DFE)1 might contain an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. We reported previously that DFE inhibits ADP-, thrombin-, and collagen-induced aggregation of human platelets (8.Grevelink S.A. Youssef D.E. Loscalzo J. Lerner E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9155-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DFE differs from the antiplatelet activities found in other arthropods in two respects. First, it does not alter cAMP levels in platelets, suggesting that it does not contain prostaglandin-like activity. Second, it does not contain apyrase activity. We report the isolation and characterization of chrysoptin, the protein in DFE responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation. We also report the cloning and expression of the cDNA encoding chrysoptin. Chrysoptin acts by inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. Deerflies were obtained from traps along saltwater marshes in northeastern Massachusetts using a modified Dustbuster (BioQuip), allowing for the collection of flies in a live state. Flies were brought to the laboratory and dissected within 8 h. Deerflies were cooled to 4 °C to decrease their activity. Under a dissecting microscope, their salivary glands were removed and placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Glands were then transferred to vials containing either 50 μl of PBS for protein purification or 500 μl of Trizol for mRNA purification. Vials containing 50 glands in PBS or 150 glands in Trizol were stored at −80 °C until use. Venous blood was obtained from volunteers who had not ingested caffeine-containing beverages for at least 12 h or cyclooxygenase inhibitors for at least 10 days. The blood was anticoagulated with 0.1 volume of 110 mmsodium citrate and used within 1 h. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifuging the blood at 120 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The upper layer (the PRP) was removed by a large-mouthed pipette and kept at room temperature. The lower layer was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min, and the upper layer thus obtained, platelet-poor plasma, was removed and used to set the 100% baseline during the aggregation assay. Assays were performed using a standard nephelometric technique (9.Born G.V.R. Cross M.J. J. Physiol. 1963; 168: 178-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). Aggregations were monitored in a platelet aggregation profiler, model PAP-4 (Bio/Data Corp., Hatboro, PA) in which 200-μl aliquots of PRP and platelet-poor plasma were incubated at 37 °C and stirred at 1000 rpm for 2 min. Fractions of salivary gland extract or recombinant wild type protein from HPLC were incubated with PRP for 30 s, prior to the addition of ADP (Bio/Data) as agonist to a final concentration of 18 μm. Other agonists included the addition of collagen (50 μl of a 1.9 mg/ml solution) and thrombin (5 μl of an 8.9 mg/ml solution) as recommended by the supplier (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT). Fibrinogen was iodinated using Iodobeads (Pierce) as described previously (10.Loscalzo J. Inbal A. Handin R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).125I-Fibrinogen was used at a concentration of 1.9 μm, approximately three times its K dof 0.68 μm, to ensure 99% saturation of the receptors under the experimental conditions used (11.Mendelsohn M.E. Oneill S. George D. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).125I-Fibrinogen was incubated with varying concentrations, as determined by amino acid analysis, of chrysoptin purified from salivary glands. The incubation was carried out in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl buffer for 10 min at 25 °C. Two hundred microliters of gel-filtered platelets activated with 10 μm ADP were added, and the mixture (350 μl) was incubated at 25 °C for an additional 60 min. Platelets and bound fibrinogen were separated from unbound fibrinogen by centrifugation through an oil mixture consisting of one part no. 556 fluid AC and two parts no. 550 fluid AE (Dow Corning, Saginaw, MI), and the platelet pellet was counted using a Cap RIA 16 gamma counter (Capintec, Inc., Ramsey, NJ). Results were expressed as the ratio of the number of fibrinogen molecules bound in the presence of chrysoptin (B) to the number bound in the absence of inhibitor (B o). Apyrase and adenylate kinase activities of salivary gland extracts were measured by the methods of Battastiniet al. (12.Battastini A.M.O. da Rocha J.B.T. Barcellos C.K. Dias R.D. Sarkis J.J.F. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and Hess and Derr (13.Hess H.H. Derr J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) as described (8.Grevelink S.A. Youssef D.E. Loscalzo J. Lerner E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9155-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One thousand frozen glands in PBS were thawed on ice, vortexed for 10 s, and transferred to a 10-ml centrifuge tube with 10 μl of proteinase inhibitor mixture consisting of 0.1 mmNa-p-tosyl-l-arginine-methylester-HCl and 1 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin A, chymostatin, and aprotinin. The combined glands, in about 5 ml of PBS, were mixed and passed twice through a 21 gauge needle. The extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was dialyzed against the anion exchange HPLC starting buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using a Slide-A-Lyzer 10K dialysis cassette (Pierce). The dialyzed material was aliquoted in 1-ml fractions and stored at −20 °C. All HPLC analyses were carried out at room temperature on a Smart system and monitored at 214 nm and 280 nm using a multiwavelength detector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Dialyzed salivary gland extracts were filtered through a 0.4 μm Tuffryn filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The extracts were injected onto an anion exchange column (Mono Q PC 1.6/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and eluted under the following linear step gradient conditions, where Buffer B was 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl: 100% Buffer A for 5 min, 50% Buffer B at 15 min, and 100% Buffer B at 20 min, maintained until 30 min, and 100% Buffer A at 35 min. The flow rate was 100 μl/min, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Eluted fractions were tested for their ability to prevent platelet aggregation. Active fractions were combined and concentrated using a low protein binding Omega Macrosep concentrator 30K (Gelman Sciences), centrifuged at 5000 × g, and stored at −20 °C. For the recombinant protein, serum-free medium containing chrysoptin was concentrated using the Macrosep concentrator 30K, filtered through a 0.4 μm sterile filter, and purified by HPLC as described above. Active fractions from AE-HPLC were mixed to a 1:1 ratio with 4 m(NH4)2SO4 and filtered through a 0.4 μm sterile filter. HI-HPLC was performed on a Phenyl Superose PC 1.6/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4 (Buffer A) and 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 m(NH4)2SO4, pH 7.4 (Buffer B) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Following equilibration in Buffer A, samples from AE-HPLC were injected and fractionated. Fractions were collected 10 min after sample loading under the following gradient conditions: 0–100% Buffer B in 5 min, maintained 100% Buffer B until 10 min, 100–36.8% Buffer B at 35 min, maintained for 6 min, 36.8–0% Buffer B at 56 min, and 100% Buffer A for an additional 10 min. Fractions were tested for their ability to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by 18 μm ADP. Active fractions were concentrated using the Microsep concentrator 30K and stored at −20 °C for further use. Size exclusion HPLC was used to estimate the molecular mass of the purified proteins and, in separate experiments, to evaluate the possible interaction between chrysoptin and fibrinogen under native conditions. A Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column was used with a buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mmNaCl, at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Twenty-five microliters of 12.5 μg of standard proteins was injected. Standard markers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and consisted of blue dextran (2000 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.5 kDa). Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10–20% gradient gels were run using precast Tricine gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 or with the Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Prestained molecular mass markers were obtained from Bio-Rad, and nonstained markers were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Amino acid analysis of AE/HI-isolated chrysoptin was performed on an Applied Biosystems 420/120 instrument following hydrolysis with HCl. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 470A instrument at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility and yielded the first 40 amino acid residues of chrysoptin. RNA was isolated from 500 dissected salivary glands using the Trizol reagent method (Life Technologies, Inc.). The glands were homogenized by passage through a 25 gauge needle, and RNA was separated by chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 15 μg of total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The mRNA was converted into ss cDNA with reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in conjunction with an oligo CCCGGGT20 primer. The ss cDNA was purified by binding to a Qiagen spin column and eluting with 50 μl of Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, buffer. Fig. 6 Billustrates schematically the strategy used to clone the chrysoptin cDNA. In this figure, nucleotide 144 corresponds to the first amino acid in chrysoptin and is the reference point for the oligonucleotide primers described. One hundred nanograms of ss cDNA were used in each of the PCRs. Degenerate 24-mer PCR primers were made based on the N-terminal sequence of chrysoptin. The forward primer was called A8-1 (GCC AGC AGC GAY GAY ACC AGC GAG) and encoded amino acids 1–8. Four reverse (antisense) primers were made: A5-1 and A6-1 (TGR AAR TCR TTR ATR TGR ACR ATG and TGG AAR TCG TTR ATG TGG ACG ATG, respectively), both encoding amino acids 20–13, and B5-1 and B6-1 (TCR TCR GTY TGY TCR AAR CGR GCG and TCR TCG GTC TGY TCG AAG CGA GCG, respectively), both encoding amino acids 28–21. PCR conditions were 94 °C preheating for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 1 min, 55 °C annealing for 1 min, 72 °C extension for 1 min, and postextension at 75 °C for 7 min. In the first PCR, using primer A8-1 with primers A5-1 and B5-1 andTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), bands of 60 and 84 bp were found on 1.5% agarose gels consistent with the sizes predicted from the N-terminal amino acid sequence. These products were purified from the gel, cloned into pCR-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and sequenced. In a second PCR, A8-1 and oligo CCCGGGT20 were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, on the ss cDNA as template in the presence of Taq plus long polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the following conditions: 94 °C preheating for 5 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min; and postextension at 72 °C for 7 min. After treating the reaction with Taq polymerase at 72 °C for 20 min to add a dA tail to the ends, the PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel, and the 1700-bp band was excised, cloned into pCR-TOPO, and sequenced. In a third PCR, directed at obtaining the 5′ end of the cDNA, oligonucleotides CCCGGGT20 and B5-1 were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, on the ss cDNA that was previously dA-tailed, under the following conditions: 94 °C preheating for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C postextension for 20 min. The PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the band migrating at 250 bp was purified, cloned, and sequenced. A fourth and final PCR was carried out to obtain the full-length chrysoptin cDNA as a single fragment. Based on the DNA sequence at the 5′ end, a forward primer with an EcoRI adapter, GGAAT TCT GAG TCG CGA TTT GAA ACT GTT, was made. This primer and the reverse primer, oligo CCCGGGT20, were used on the ss cDNA template in the presence of plaque-forming unit DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under the following conditions: 94 °C preheating for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and 72 °C postextension for 7 min. The reaction was run on a 1% agarose gel, and the band migrating at 1850 bp was excised from the gel and cloned into a pCR-blunt vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid preparations were made from two of the clones, and the DNA was sequenced in both directions by manual sequencing using T7 Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as well as automated dideoxy sequencing using a Li-Cor 4000L device. The coding sequences were identical between the two clones, although several differences were noted in the 3′-untranslated region (data not shown). The sequence has been submitted to GenBankTM and has the accession numberAF169229. Chrysoptin cDNA made in the final PCR was excised from pCR-blunt vector withEcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pBacPAK9 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Pure plasmid DNA was made and transfected into Sf21 cells as described in theCLONTECH protocol. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the medium containing the chrysoptin recombinant virus was harvested and used to infect fresh Sf21 cells. For the production of recombinant protein, fresh Sf21 cells were grown in serum-free medium and infected with the recombinant virus for 48 h. The medium was harvested and concentrated, and the protein was purified by AE/HI-HPLC. Several alanine substitution mutations were introduced into the chrysoptin coding sequence using the Quick Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Sequencing of the resultant DNAs was performed to confirm the mutations. These mutants were expressed in Sf21 cells and tested for functional activity. Activity was noted in the culture supernatants. As a result, HPLC purification of the mutants was not performed. An HPLC approach to the isolation of chrysoptin was undertaken. A variety of separation modalities were evaluated, including anion exchange, reverse phase, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Biological activity was determined by inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation and was not retained following reverse phase HPLC. This observation may have resulted from the relatively harsh effects of acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid on the tertiary structure of chrysoptin. The milder buffer conditions encountered with AE and HI resulted in the retention of biological activity following chromatography. Thus, AE followed by HI was selected for the isolation of the active principle. AE-HPLC was used to initially separate salivary gland extracts for the native protein and culture medium for the recombinant protein. Fractions 9 and 10, eluting at 9 and 10 min, respectively (Fig.1), were the only ones found to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Because multiple components could be hidden within this peak, the active fractions were applied to a HI column and yielded a single active peak (Fig.2). Size exclusion HPLC revealed that the activity migrated with a native molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa (Fig. 3), similar to the results on gel electrophoresis (Figs. 4 and5). Gel electrophoresis further revealed that the combined HPLC approaches resulted in preparation of an essentially homogenous single active component. This protein was named chrysoptin, consistent with the genus name,Chrysops. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed the following 40 residues: AS(S)D(D)SREFPLSIVHINDFHARFEQTDELG(G)E (K/C)KPTAK(K/C)V. Residues in parentheses were not definitive, and for the last two such residues, the amino acid following the slash is predicted from the cDNA sequence.Figure 2Hydrophobic interaction HPLC elution profile of the deerfly salivary gland extract. ——, profile of the total extract. - - - - -, chromatogram of the active fractions from anion exchange HPLC. – – – –, chromatography conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” using an (NH4)2SO4 gradient in the elution buffer.

The approach used is detailed under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 6 B. Forward and reverse degenerate oligonucleotide primers that corresponded to sequences within the N-terminal 40 residues were synthesized and used in two PCRs to amplify a small portion near the 5′ end of the chrysoptin cDNA. Sequencing of the two amplified bands yielded sequence information that corresponded to the amino acid residues between the degenerate primers. New primers with the exact nucleotide sequence could have been synthesized and used to amplify the cDNA. However, use of the already-synthesized degenerate forward primer was successful, in conjunction with the oligo-dT primer, in the amplification of the 1700 nucleotides corresponding to the major (3′) portion of the chrysoptin cDNA. The dA-tailed cDNA was used in another PCR with the oligo-dT primer and a reverse degenerate primer near the N terminus of chrysoptin. The 250-bp band obtained was sequenced, and an exact forward primer near the 5′ end was synthesized, with the addition of an EcoRI linker, and used with the oligo-dT primer in the presence of a high fidelity polymerase to amplify salivary gland ss cDNA. An 1850-bp PCR product for the cDNA encoding the complete coding portion of chrysoptin was obtained and sequenced in both directions by both automatic and manual sequencing methods to ensure the fidelity of resulting sequence. The two techniques yielded identical sequences. PCR cloning resulted in two cDNAs that differed only at the 3′ end, one cDNA being longer by 27 bases, indicating that there may be more than one allele of chrysoptin among the deerfly population that was collected. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence to that of proteins in GenBankTM did not reveal any homology (Fig. 6 A). The initiating methionine codon (ATG) is at 59 bp in the cDNA. An open reading frame of 1662 bp continues to the stop codon (TAA) at bp position 1721. From the amino acid and DNA sequence analysis, it can be deduced that the protein is secreted with a signal peptide of 25 amino acids encoded between nucleotides 59 and 144. Two putative polyadenylation signals (AATTTA) starting at positions 1759 and 1792 bp were identified. The commonly occurring AATAAA poly(A) signal, present between bp 1802 and 1807, may also serve as a polyadenylation signal, although it is close to the 3′ end. Five putative N-linked glycosylation sites are present between bp 374 and 382, 617 and 625, 671 and 679, 941 and 949, and 1274 and 1282. In contrast to other fibrinogen receptor antagonists, no RGD sites are found in the cDNA, although an RGN site is present at bp 1268–1276. Expression of chrysoptin was undertaken in order to confirm, by measuring biological activity, that the correct protein and corresponding cDNA had been isolated from deerfly salivary gland extracts. The natural material can only be obtained during the short summer season of the deerfly, as this insect has not been reared in the laboratory. The availability of recombinant protein would eliminate the difficulties in obtaining limited quantities of natural material for further studies, such as the structure-function relationship of chrysoptin. Furthermore, mutations in the chrysoptin sequence, induced to determine functional domains, can only be done on recombinant material. It was reasonable to express the chrysoptin in baculovirus, as it is an insect protein. It was expressed using full-length cDNA including its signal peptide sequence. Recombinant chrysoptin was isolated from Sf21 culture supernatants, purified using HPLC, and examined by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). Inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by recombinant chrysoptin is demonstrated in Fig.7 A. Recombinant chrysoptin was also effective at inhibiting collagen and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (not shown). Several alanine mutations were introduced into the coding sequence of chrysoptin to determine the functional relevance of the RGN and putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Mutation of either the Arg or Asn residue of the RGN sequence did not diminish activity, as measured by inhibition of platelet aggregation. Activity of the mutant containing the AGN sequence is shown in Fig. 7 B. Likewise, individual mutations of the other putativeN-linked glycosylation sites did not diminish activity. In contrast, converting all of the asparagines in the putative glycosylation sites to alanines led to an inactive molecule. This latter result is consistent with our observation that expression of chrysoptin in Escherichia coli yielded an inactive protein, although other possibilities exist, as noted under “Discussion.” Note that the Asn of the RGN tripeptide is also one of the putativeN-linked glycosylation sites. Because the binding of fibrinogen to its receptor on the platelet surface is essential for aggregation responses to all agonists, the effect of chrysoptin on fibrinogen binding was examined. Purified natural chrysoptin inhibited 125I-fibrinogen binding to activated platelets in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 95 pmol (Fig. 8). It is likely, but not proven, that all of the platelet inhibitory activity in DFE is accounted for by chrysoptin. The results of the above experiment suggest that chrysoptin interacts directly with the fibrinogen receptor rather than the fibrinogen molecule itself. To further address the possibility that chrysoptin interacts directly with fibrinogen, these two entities were examined via gel filtration both separately and after co-incubation in the same citrate buffer used for aggregation experiments (Fig. 9). The observation that the fibrinogen peak in Fig. 9 C does not shift to the left and that the chrysoptin peak does not diminish in size suggests that chrysoptin and fibrinogen do not interact under conditions that allow chrysoptin to interact with platelets. This result is consistent with chrysoptin interacting directly with the fibrinogen receptor. Because apyrase activity has been found in arthropod salivary gland extracts from ticks (3.Ribiero J.M.C. Endris T.M. Endris R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 100: 109-112Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), mosquitoes (4.Ribeiro J.M. Sarkis J.F. Rossignol P.A. Spielman A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 79B: 81-86Google Scholar), blood-sucking bugs (5.Ribeiro J.M.C. Garcia E.S. J. Insect. Physiol. 1980; 26: 303-307Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and tse-tse flies (6.Mant M.J. Parker K.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1981; 48: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), chrysoptin was examined for such activity. Although the assay was sensitive enough to detect quantities of apyrase below the threshold for antiplatelet activity, negligible apyrase activity was detected in aliquots corresponding to twice the IC50 of chrysoptin. In addition, aliquots of chrysoptin did not contain adenylate kinase activity (data not shown). Platelets have an important role in the pathophysiology of unstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, and stroke, which together make up the most common causes of mortality in the U.S. During the past 15 years, an array of agents directed at various steps of platelet activation and aggregation have been developed and tested in basic and clinical trials. These agents include RGD peptides and derivatives, monoclonal antibodies to the IIb/IIIa receptor, von Willebrand factor antagonists, serotonin receptor antagonists, thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists, prostacyclin and analogues, synthetic thrombin inhibitors, apyrases, and ticlopidine and clopidogrel (14.Quinn M.J. Fitzgerald D.J. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 15.Topol E.J. Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. Lancet. 1999; 353: 227-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Many of these antiplatelet agents have shown promise in basic and clinical trials, and several are now approved for clinical use, but their utility has often been hampered by systemic side effects, including hypotension and prolongation of bleeding times (16.Bednar M.M. Gross C.E. Stroke. 1999; 30: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17.Scarborough R.M. Kleiman N.S. Phillips D.R. Circulation. 1999; 100: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Consequently, there is a need for the development of more potent and more selective antiplatelet agents. The data presented here demonstrate that salivary gland lysates of the deerfly contain chrysoptin, a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Chrysoptin is encoded by a cDNA with a conventional leader sequence and at least five potential glycosylation sites. The cDNA encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 58 kDa that is apparently posttranslationally modified to a mature protein of 65 kDa. It appears that glycosylation is necessary for activity, although which of the five putative sites are critical is not known. Alanine substitution mutants introduced individually at the five putativeN-linked glycosylation sites maintained the capacity to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation, but a chrysoptin in which all five sites were mutated was inactive, consistent with the lack of expression of a functional molecule in E. coli. Caution must be exercised in interpreting these results, as additional possibilities exist. For example, it is possible that the expression in E. coli of an inactive protein could be due to improper folding of chrysoptin, which contains six cysteine residues, rather than a lack of glycosylation. It is also possible that appropriate glycosylation is needed in order for chrysoptin to fold properly, as has been reported for other proteins (18.Weintraub B.D. Stannard B.S. Meyers L. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1331-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It would be reasonable to evaluate the role of glycosylation in receptor blockade by chrysoptin by expressing the protein in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors or by deglycosylation of the recombinant protein. Activity of the reduced protein could also be determined to examine the contribution of the disulfide bonds to function. No RGD sites are present in the cDNA, although an RGN site is present. Substitution of either the Arg or Asn with alanine did not diminish activity. This result indicates that neither a conventional RGD nor related RGN or AGN sites are needed for activity of recombinant chrysoptin. Note in addition that this particular Asn also belongs to one of the putative glycosylation sites that was mutated without loss of function. There does not appear to be a relationship between chrysoptin and the disintegrins, a family of integrin inhibitory proteins from viper venoms (19.Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Both chrysoptin and the disintegrins are potent platelet inhibitors and inhibit fibrinogen binding. However, chrysoptin has a molecular size of approximately 65 kDa, whereas the disintegrins range in size from 5.4 to 9 kDa. In addition, chrysoptin (IC50 = 95 pmol) is 300 times more active than trigramin, a representative disintegrin (IC50 = 30 nmol), at blocking fibrinogen binding (20.Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Lukasiewicz H. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16157-16163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Explanations for the potency of chrysoptin include the possibility that it binds to multiple sites on the fibrinogen receptor or that it may alter the conformation of the receptor, thereby preventing fibrinogen binding to either RGD or non-RGD sites, such as the γ chain dodecapeptide (21.Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Lukas T.J. Hawiger J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Studies investigating how the inhibition of fibrinogen binding by chrysoptin is mediated should help to elucidate the normal mechanisms of platelet function. Chrysoptin is one of the most potent inhibitor of fibrinogen binding known. Although this study is the first to report the isolation of a platelet aggregation inhibitor from an arthropod, other potent antihemostatic activities have been described in arthropods. These include vasodilators from the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis(22.Lerner E.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. Nelson J.R. Lerner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11234-11236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the black fly Simulium vittatum (23.Cupp M.S. Ribeiro J.M. Champagne D.E. Cup E.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibitors of blood coagulation factor Xa from the soft tick Ornithodora moubata (24.Waxman L. Smith D.E. Arcuri K.E. Vlasuk G.P. Science. 1990; 248: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and the black fly Simulium vittatum (25.Jacobs J.W. Cupp E.W. Sardane M. Friedman P.A. Thromb. Res. 1990; 15: 869-878Google Scholar). An overriding concept in these studies is that an organism (such as an arthropod) can be examined for a particular function (such as blood-feeding), leading to the discovery of novel proteins and genes. Such proteins and genes will provide new tools with which to study hematologic and cardiovascular pharmacology and may lead to new therapeutic agents.

Recently, we reported that alternative splicing of exon 9 was induced by low serum or acidic media in mouse myoblasts, and that this splicing required de novo protein synthesis of a negative regulatory factor (Ichida, M., Endo, H., Ikeda, U., Matsuda, C., Ueno, E., Shimada, K., and Kagawa, Y. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 8492–8501; Hayakawa, M., Endo, H., Hamamoto, T., and Kagawa, Y. (1998)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 251, 603–608). In the present report, we identified a cis-acting element on the muscle-specific alternatively spliced exon of F1γ gene by an in vivo splicing system using cultured cells and transgenic mice. We constructed a F1γ wild-type minigene, containing the full-length gene from exon 8 to exon 10, and two mutants; one mutant involved a pyrimidine-rich substitution on exon 9, whereas the other was a purine-rich substitution, abbreviated as F1γ Pu-del and F1γ Pu-rich mutants, respectively. Based on an in vivo splicing assay using low serum- or acid-stimulated splicing induction system in mouse myoblasts, Pu-del mutation inhibited exon inclusion, indicating that a Pu-del mutation would disrupt an exonic splicing enhancer. On the other hand, the Pu-rich mutation blocked muscle-specific exon exclusion following both inductions. Next, we produced transgenic mice bearing both mutant minigenes and analyzed their splicing patterns in tissues. Based on an analysis of F1γ Pu-del minigene transgenic mice, the purine nucleotide of this element was shown to be necessary for exon inclusion in non-muscle tissue. In contrast, analysis of F1γ Pu-rich minigene mice revealed that the F1γ Pu-rich mutant exon had been excluded from heart and skeletal muscle of these transgenic mice, despite the fact mutation of the exon inhibited muscle-specific exon exclusion in myotubes of early embryonic stage. These results suggested that the splicing regulatory mechanism underlying F1γ pre-mRNA differed between myotubes and myofibers during myogenesis and cardiogenesis.

Recently, both cis-acting elements andtrans-acting factors have been reported to varying degrees (1.Smith C.W.J. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1991; 251: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Significant progress has been made in identifying the alternative splicing mechanism involved in the Drosophilasex determination pathway (4.Inoue K. Hoshijima K. Higuchi I. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y.

Exonic and intronic cis-acting regulatory elements for RNA splicing have been reported in a number of mammalian genes located near weak 5′ and 3′ splice sites, and these elements appear to be involved in the control of stage- or tissue-specific splicing events (5.Tian M.

For example, a majority of exonic splicing enhancer (ESE)1 elements have been reported to be abundant in purine nucleotides (14.Staknis D. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7670-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15.Wang Z. Hoffman M.H. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar), and these elements have been shown to bind the splicing factor for control of alternative splicing. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, a group of splicing factors, play important roles both in ESE-independent and ESE-dependent splicing (8.Lavigueur A. La Branche H. Kornblihtt A.R. Chabot B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 9.Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). SR proteins show RNA binding activity to each cis-acting element, as well as protein-protein interaction activity in the formation of a commitment complex of spliceosome (16.Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). SF2/ASF and SC35, two SR proteins, differ in their ability to commit different pre-mRNAs to the splicing pathway (18.Fu X.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). SF2/ASF, but not SC35, recognized sequences very similar to purine-rich elements found in various natural splicing enhancers (9.Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,19.Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (3511): 3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). SRp40, another member of the SR protein group, binds specific ESE, and one study showed that phosphorylation of the arginrine/serine-rich domain is necessary for sequence-specific binding (20.Tacke R. Chen Y. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Research has shown that tissue-specific distribution of SR proteins varies to a certain degree and that overexpression of SR proteins in vivo alters the splicing pattern. Hence, the likelihood is that either tissue-specific or development stage-specific alternative splicing is controlled by changes in the amount of SR proteins or by covalent modification of these SR proteins, as in phosphorylation control (16.Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we cloned the mitochondrial ATP synthase γ-subunit (F1γ) gene and reported that its tissue-specific isoforms were generated by alternative splicing in the human, cow, and mouse (21.Matsuda C. Endo H. Hirata H. Morosawa H. Nakanishi M. Kagawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22.Matsuda C. Endo H. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. J. Biol.

RNA transcripts excluding exon 9 are specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissue (21.Matsuda C. Endo H. Hirata H. Morosawa H. Nakanishi M. Kagawa Y.

F1γ mRNA contains exon 9 in mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, but F1γ mRNA showed exclusion of exon 9 in myotubes (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This muscle-type mRNA is cell-specifically and reversibly induced by acidic stimulation in human fibrosarcoma, human rhabdomyosarcoma, and mouse myoblast cells (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24.Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this process of muscle-specific exon selection was inhibited by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 in these cell lines (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24.Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other muscle-specific alternative splicing in the neural cell-adhesion molecules, β-tropomyosin, MEF2A, and MEF2D genes was induced by this acidic stimulation (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The above muscle-specific alternative splicing likely requires de novoprotein synthesis of a splicing regulatory factor. In fact, we found evidence using an in vitro splicing system that a negative regulatory factor for muscle-specific exon exclusion of human F1γ pre-mRNA existed in nuclear extracts from acid-stimulated human fibrosarcoma cells (25.Hayakawa M. Endo H. Hamamoto T. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to determine the exact regulatory mechanism underlying muscle-specific alternative splicing in muscle tissue. In the present study, we identified the cis-acting regulatory element for alternative splicing of F1γ pre-mRNA and showed that the action of this element in myotubes and mature muscle fibers differed. Using in vivo splicing analysis of mouse F1γ minigenes, we determined that acis-acting regulatory element on the alternatively spliced exon was important for both exon inclusion and exclusion in culture cells. Purine-rich mutation on the exon of F1γ minigene, which likely destroys the negative regulatory element, blocked muscle-specific exon exclusion in myotubes. In contrast, the purine-rich mutation of the F1γ minigene failed to block exon exclusion in skeletal and heart muscle tissues in transgenic mice. This difference between the splicing regulation that occurs during myogenesis and cardiogenesis will be discussed. C2C12, mouse myoblast cells, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. L929, mouse fibrosarcoma cells, were provided by Dr. T. Kirikae (Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan). The C2C12 cells and L929 cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as growth medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were plated on 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes. Once the C2C12 cells had grown to semi-confluence, the growth medium was replaced with two different media. The differentiation medium (low serum medium) was DMEM with 2% heat-inactivated horse serum (Irvine Scientific), while the acidic medium was DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.7 mm NaHCO3 (final pH 6.6 under 5% CO2). Once the L929 cells had grown to semiconfluence, the growth medium was replaced with acidic medium and cultured for 48 h as acidic stimulation. Primary culture of myoblasts prepared from skeletal muscle of embryonic day 19 transgenic mice was plated at 1 × 106/60-mm diameter tissue culture dish. A mouse F1γ genome fragment from exon 8 to exon 10 was obtained from plasmid pBluescript II (SK+)-F1γ (pBS-F1γ) (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pcDEBSRα mammalian expression vector (26.Hayakawa H. Koike G. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol.

Hayakawa, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan) as F1γ wild-type minigene (pcDEBSRα-F1γ wild-type minigene) forin vivo splicing assay. Mutations on the alternatively spliced exon of pcDEBSRα-F1γ wild-type minigene was created using two-piece PCR cloning strategy (13.Humphrey M.B. Bryan J. Cooper T.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using pBS-F1γ plasmid DNA. Mutant overlapping primer pairs (MU1 and MU2; MU3 and MU4) were generated for purine-rich and pyrimidine-rich mutants on exon 9, respectively. Primers M13 and M13RV for pBluescript II were used as the common outside oligonucleotides. MU1 with M13RV and MU2 with M13 were used to generate individual mutated ends of the clone of interest. The two PCR products were then separated on 1% agarose gel and eluted. A third round of PCR using M13 and M13RV with the two PCR products was used to generate the full-length mutated insert. Two full-length inserts were resubcloned into dideoxy T vector of pBluescript II SK+ and confirmed by sequencing on both strands around the mutated regions. Finally, these F1γ mutants were subcloned into pcDEBSRα, as described above. Pyrimidine-rich F1γ mutant minigene and purine-rich F1γ mutant minigenes were termed F1γ Pu-del and F1γ Pu-rich minigenes, respectively. Sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-CCT-AAT-ATA-ATA-ACC-AGG-GAT-TTT-TTT-TTT-TCA-AGT-TGC-A-3′ (sense strand; MU1) and 3′-TGG-TCC-CTA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AGT-TCA-ACG-TAG-GAG-TCT-GTT-5′ (antisense strand; MU2) for F1γ Pu-del mutant minigene; 5′-ACC-AGG-GAT-TAA-TGA-AAA-TAA-AGA-AGA-AGA-ATC-AGA-CAA-3′ (sense strand; MU3) and 3′-ACT-TTT-ATT-TCT-TCT-TCT-TAG-TCT-GTT-CTC-CAT-TTC-AA-5′ (antisense strand; MU4) for F1γ Pu-rich mutant minigene. After C2C12 myoblasts and L929 fibrosarcoma cells had been cultured with growth medium to semiconfluence, the cells were transfected with 5 μg each of pcDEBSRα-F1γ wild-type and two mutant minigenes using the polycationic liposome method (DMRIE-C, Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, the cells were cultured with growth medium, acidic medium, and differentiation medium for 3 days, and then harvested. Transgenic mice were established following the standard protocol described previously (27.Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manupulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 153-173Google Scholar). To construct the expression plasmid for transgenic mouse, two F1γ mutant minigenes were subcloned into the pCAGGS expression vector (28.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). pCAGGS-F1γ mutants were digested withSalI and BamHI. The DNA fragments were separated on 1% agarose gel, eluted, and extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol. The purified DNA fragment was dissolved to a final concentration of 500 copies/pl with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mm EDTA for microinjection. C57BL/6J mice were used for microinjection, and ICR mice were used as foster mothers. We simultaneously co-injected green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene constructed in the same pCAGGS expression vector, pMG2 (29.Kimata Y. Iwaki M. Lim C.R. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. K. Kohno, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan). pMG2 were digested with SalI and BamHI. The purified GFP DNA fragments were mixed with the F1γ mutant minigene DNA fragments (ratio = 1:1, the final concentration 500 copies/pl) subjected to microinjection. Total RNAs were prepared from C2C12 cells, L929 cells, and the tissue of transgenic mice following the acid guanidine method (30.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and then each 10 μg of total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR as described previously (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To analyze splicing patterns of F1γ mRNA, PCR was performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min in a total volume of 100 μl, which contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 11.5 mm MgCl2, 200 nm amounts of each dNTP, 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, 1/20 (v/v) of synthesized first-strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of recombinantTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). Thirty PCR cycles were used. The PCR primers sets were as follows; for endogenous F1γ mRNA, 5′-GTC-ATC-ACA-AAA-GAG-TTG-ATT-G-3′ (sense strand, corresponding to a portion of exon 8 of human F1γ) and 5′-TAA-TGG-AGG-AAC-AGT-TTC-TTC-G-3′ (antisense strand, corresponding to a portion of exon 10 of human F1γ); for exogenous F1γ minigene mRNA, 5′-GTC-ATC-ACA-AAA-GAG-TTG-ATT-G-3′ (sense strand, corresponding to a portion of exon 8 of human F1γ) and 5′-TAA-TGG-AGG-AAC-AGT-TTC-TTC-G-3′ (antisense strand, corresponding to a portion of pcDEBSRα poly(A) site). To analyze the splicing pattern in transgenic mice, the following primer sets were used; for endogenous F1γ, 5′-GCC-AAC-CTC-ATC-TAC-TAC-TCC-3′ (sense strand, corresponding to a portion of exon 7 of human F1γ) and 5′-TAA-TGG-AGG-AAC-AGT-TTC-TTC-G-3′ (antisense strand, corresponding to a portion of exon 10 of human F1γ); for exogenous F1γ minigene, 5′-GTC-ATC-ACA-AAA-GAG-TTG-ATT-G-3′ (sense strand, corresponding to a portion of exon 8 of human F1γ) and 5′-GCC-AGA-AGT-CAG-ATG-CTC-AAG-G-3′ (antisense strand, corresponding to a portion of pCAGGS poly(A) site). The size of the PCR products was determined by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the products were stained using ethidium bromide. To investigate the role of exon recognition for muscle-specific alternative splicing, we constructed a mouse F1γ minigene and developed an in vivoalternative splicing system by inducing differentiation in C2C12 mouse myoblasts (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The F1γ wild-type minigene was constructed in pcDEBSRα mammalian expression vector (26.Hayakawa H. Koike G. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (pcDEBSRα-F1γ wild-type minigene), which contained a full-length mouse F1γ genomic gene corresponding to human F1γ gene from exon 8 to exon 10 (GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ Data Bank accession no. U43893) (Fig.1 a). Muscle-specific alternative splicing of endogenous F1γ pre-mRNA in C2C12 mouse myoblasts is induced in two different ways; one is replacement from growth medium to differentiation medium, and the other is replacement to acidic medium (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After transfection of pcDEBSRα-F1γ wild-type minigene to C2C12 cells, culture medium was changed to growth, differentiation, and acidic media. Three days later, all cells were subjected to RT-PCR in order to detect splicing patterns of both endogenous and exogenous transcripts. As shown in Fig. 1 (b and c), muscle-specific exclusion of exon 9 in both endogenous F1γ pre-mRNA and exogenous pcDEBSRα-F1γ wild-type minigene pre-mRNA was observed after induction by differentiation medium or acidic medium. This minigene contains all genomic sequences from exon 8 to exon 10 of mouse F1γ gene, and the spliced transcripts of the minigene was independently regulated by both induction systems in a similar manner as endogenous induction. These results indicated that the F1γ wild-type minigene contained all cis-acting regulatory elements involved in muscle-specific alternative splicing. Based on a comparison of the genomic sequences around exon 9 of F1γ gene in the human, cow, and mouse, a relatively purine-rich sequence was found at 5′ region of exon 9 in all three animal models (Fig. 2). Previously, exonic splicing enhancer containing purine-rich sequences was reported to play an important role in splice site selection (10.Watakabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To determine whether this sequence is a cis-acting element involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of F1γ, we constructed two types of mutant minigenes derived from the pcDEBSRα-F1γ wild-type minigene (Fig.2 b). One type was a F1γ Pu-del mutant, made by introducing an 11-nucleotide stretch of poly(U) into the exon of wild-type minigene in place of the relatively purine-rich sequence at the 5′ region of the exon. The other was a F1γ Pu-rich mutant, made by introducing a purine-rich sequence, AAAGAAGAAGAA, into the middle region of the exon. This purine-rich sequence was derived from the 5′ region of exon 10 of F1γ gene and resembled the relatively purine-rich sequence at the 5′ region of exon 9 (Fig.2 b). In vivo splicing assay using F1γ Pu-del mutant minigene transfected to C2C12 myoblasts revealed that no inclusion of the Pu-del mutant exon had occurred in the C2C12 cells cultured in growth medium, despite the fact that the wild-type exon of endogenous F1γ pre-mRNA was included (Fig.3 a, lane 4). In addition, Pu-del mutant exon was also excluded from C2C12 cells cultured with differentiation and acidic media (Fig.3 a, lanes 5 and 6). A similar experiment revealed that, as in the myoblasts, the Pu-del mutant exon was not included in mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells (Fig.3 b, lanes 5 and 6). The transcripts of F1γ wild-type minigene in L929 cells included exon 9 in both growth and acidic media (Fig. 3 b,lanes 1 and 2), as observed in endogenous F1γ transcripts in the cells (data not shown). These results indicated that the presence of purine nucleotides on the wild-type exon was very important in splice site selection of this alternatively spliced exon. The other mutant minigene, F1γ Pu-rich minigene constructed in pcDEBSRα, was also tested. The alternative exon of F1γ Pu-rich minigene pre-mRNA was selected in C2C12 cells cultured not only in growth medium but also in differentiation and acidic media (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1–3). In addition, the Pu-rich exon was primarily included in L929 cells cultured in growth and acidic media, whereas the wild-type exon of F1γ minigene was partially excluded from cells with acidic medium (Fig. 3 b, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggested that the purine-rich mutant sequence enhanced the inclusion of an alternative exon of F1γ pre-mRNA in myoblast, myotubes, and non-muscle cells. In summary, the moderately purine-rich sequence at the 5′ region of wild-type exon played a role in the selection of exon 9 as an exonic splicing enhancer, and the Pu-del mutant sequence disrupted this putative enhancer sequence and its activity. On the other hand, muscle-specific exon exclusion was inhibited in Pu-rich mutant minigene. Based on these results, we constructed two types of mutant minigenes; one was a Pu-del mutant minigene, the exon of which is constitutively excluded, while the other was a Pu-rich mutant minigene, the exon of which is included in every culture condition. In order to determine whether this exonic cis-acting element was important for alternative splicing of F1γ pre-mRNA even in various tissues in vivo, we produced transgenic mice carrying either a Pu-del or Pu-rich mutant minigene, both of which were re-subcloned into a pCAGGS mammalian expression vector (28.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 a). Both of the minigenes in the pCAGGS vector which had transfected into myoblasts were confirmed to work well, in the same way as minigenes in the pcDEBSRα vector (data not shown). Three lines of transgenic mice containing F1γ Pu-del mutant minigenes were produced from the 42 eggs surviving after microinjection, while four lines of transgenic mice containing F1γ Pu-rich mutant minigene were produced from 77 eggs (TableI).Table ITransgene frequency of F1γ mutant minigene and GFP geneF0 transgenic miceTotalF1γGFPF1γ and GFPPu-del42322Pu-rich77433F1γ/GFP indicates the number of transgenic mice that have F1γ mutant minigene and GFP gene. Open table in a new tab F1γ/GFP indicates the number of transgenic mice that have F1γ mutant minigene and GFP gene. At the same time, we co-injected a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in the same expression vector, pMG2 (29.Kimata Y. Iwaki M. Lim C.R. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), in order to allow for: 1) selection of transgenic mice using GFP and 2) detection of expression patterns of the promoter activity in various tissues of transgenic mice. GFP has been shown to be useful as a marker in transgenic mice given its lack of toxicity, high sensitivity, and reproducibility (31.Ikawa M. Kominami K. Yoshimura Y. Tanaka K. Nishimune Y. Okabe O. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 455-459Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32.Ikawa M. Kominami K. Yoshimura Y. Tanaka K. Nishimune Y. Okabe O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We co-injected two types of DNA fragments, F1γ mutant minigene and GFP cDNA. The GFP used in this study was a double mutant (S65T/S147P) that is strongly fluorescent and heat-stable (29.Kimata Y. Iwaki M. Lim C.R. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The majority of GFP-carrying F0 transgenic pups, which were detected by UV irradiation (wavelength 360 nm), carried both minigenes and expressed their mRNA (Table I). F1 transgenic mice were obtained from all F0 mice expressing GFP and F1γ mutant minigenes, using simple selection of transgenic pups by GFP (Fig. 4 b). pCAGGS mammalian expression vector has a cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter (28.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). The fluorescent signals of GFP expressed in various tissues of transgenic mice were observed using a CCD camera under 488 nm excitation light (fluorescent microscopy MZ FL III, Leica). As shown in Fig. 4 c, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and brain were visualized as strongly green under blue light. On the other hand, very weak fluorescence was observed in the spleen. These results indicated that the chicken β-actin promoter showed activity in various tissues of transgenic mice. Thus, we demonstrated that GFP is a useful marker for selection of living transgenic mice and for simple detection of promoter activity. As the promoter of pCAGGS was shown to be expressed in various tissues, we investigated the splicing pattern of F1γ mutant minigenes in the organs of transgenic mice. Total RNA was prepared from several organs of 4-week-old transgenic mice and then subjected to RT-PCR analysis (Fig.5). Splicing patterns of endogenous mouse F1γ pre-mRNA in various tissues revealed that exclusion of exon 9 was specific to heart and skeletal muscle tissues (Fig. 5 a). The alternative exon of F1γ Pu-del pre-mRNA was excluded not only in skeletal and heart muscle tissues, but also in non-muscle organs such as the liver, brain, spleen, and kidney (Fig. 5 b). These data indicated that purine nucleotides at the 5′ region of wild-type exon were necessary for exon inclusion to occur in cultured myoblast cells and non-muscle organs, suggesting that this region is an exonic splicing enhancer in non-muscle organs as same as in culture cells. Next, we analyzed the splicing patterns of Pu-rich mutant minigene transcripts in various tissues. As shown in Fig. 5 c, interestingly, the Pu-rich mutant exon of exogenous F1γ minigene was excluded in skeletal and heart muscle tissues, although this exon was included even in myotubes (Fig. 3 a). The difference between the splicing patterns in cultured myotubes and those in mature muscle fibers suggested that differential regulation is involved in the muscle-specific alternative splicing for each stage of muscle development. To confirm the possibility of differential regulation of alternative splicing in F1γ pre-mRNA during myogenesis and cardiogenesis, we analyzed the splicing pattern of F1γ Pu-rich and endogenous F1γ pre-mRNAs in the heart and forelimbs of transgenic mice at each embryonic day. Heart and skeletal muscle tissues of 4-week-old transgenic mice were used as controls. Fetal hearts from embryonic day (E) 9–15 were prepared under a stereoscopic microscope. The E9 heart had already begun to beat at that point. As shown in Fig.6 a, the endogenous exon 9 of F1γ pre-mRNA was primarily excluded in heart from E9 to adult. In contrast, the Pu-rich mutant exon was shown to be partially excluded in fetal hearts; the ratio was approximately 1:1. This Pu-rich mutant exon was mostly excluded in adult heart, and thus a differential regulation of muscle-specific splicing likely exists between fetal and adult heart muscles. Forelimbs were prepared from E10 to E15 transgenic mice containing both muscle and non-muscle tissues. In general, myoblasts appeared in forelimb from E10 to E11 and myotubes from E11 to E12 (33.Lassar A.B. Munsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 34.Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis revealed that E10 forelimb expressed only the non-muscle type of both endogenous and exogenous F1γ pre-mRNAs (Fig.6 b). Exclusion of the endogenous wild-type exon was detectable in E11 and E12 forelimbs, whereas no exclusion of Pu-rich mutant exon was detected in the same samples. Exogenous Pu-rich mutant exon of F1γ minigene was shown to be excluded from E13 forelimbs. At the early stage of myotube formation in forelimbs, exon exclusion was inhibited in Pu-rich mutant minigene transcripts. These data indicated that muscle-specific alternative splicing of F1γ pre-mRNA was differentially regulated during myogenesis and cardiogenesis. To establish that a difference exists between the alternative splicing regulations of F1γ pre-mRNA in myotubes and that in mature muscle fibers, we analyzed primary cultures of myoblasts and myotubes from skeletal muscle of transgenic mice using a F1γ Pu-rich mutant minigene. Primary cultures were contaminated with a number of different fibroblasts, although myotube formation was observed after treatment with differentiation medium (Fig.7 a). From RT-PCR analysis of primary culture cells, muscle-specific exon exclusion of endogenous F1γ pre-mRNA was observed after treatment with acidic or differentiation medium (Fig. 7 b, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, no exclusion of Pu-rich mutant exon was observed after treatment with either medium (Fig.7 b, lanes 2 and 3). In these cells, the non-muscle type of F1γ splicing pattern was predominant, so that an abundance of non-myoblast cells, such as fibroblasts, was found in the primary cultures. Although they were very faint, bands of muscle-type endogenous F1γ transcripts were detected after induction (Fig. 7 b, lanes 5 and 6). These results from primary cultures of myoblasts and myotubes supported the finding that muscle-specific alternative splicing of F1γ pre-mRNA was differentially regulated between myotubes and mature muscle tissues. The present study demonstrated that the cis-acting elements play an essential role in exonic alternative splicing of F1γ pre-mRNA both during myogenesis and cardiogenesis. First, in vivo splicing analyses in mouse myoblasts and in a transgenic mouse system using F1γ mutant minigenes revealed that purine nucleotides at the 5′ region of the alternatively spliced exon were important for exon inclusion in non-muscle cells and tissues. Second, a Pu-rich mutation at the middle region of the exon inhibited muscle-specific exon exclusion in myotubes, but did not inhibit in heart and skeletal muscle tissues of transgenic mice. This discrepancy in the splicing patterns of the mutant exon between myotubes and mature muscle fibers suggests that there is a difference of the alternative splicing of F1γ in each step of muscle development. The exonic cis-acting positive regulatory element of F1γ, we demonstrated here, located on the 5′ region of the alternatively spliced exon. In general, splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs requires the consensus sequences in 5′ and 3′ splice sites, branching point, and polypyrimidine tract. In cases where the polypyrimidine tract is weak, splicing enhancer sequences are needed, such as ESEs (9.Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 10.Watakabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). ESE-dependent splicing reaction requires SR proteins, for example SF2/ASF and SC35, which are needed at an early stage of spliceosome assembly. These SR proteins are able to bind to each specific RNA cis-element (9.Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19.Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (3511): 3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and these elements have been primarily reported to be purine nucleotide-rich sequences. An exon inclusion activity of the enhancer element of F1γ was clearly proved by in vivo splicing assay using a Pu-del mutant minigene in myoblasts and in non-muscle tissues of transgenic mice (Figs. 3 and 5 b). The enhancer element was rich in purine nucleotide and was not identical to well known ESE sequences. This exonic enhancer sequence would require a sequence-specific splicing factor such as SR proteins. Previously, we reported on a reversible induction system of muscle-specific alternative splicing of F1γ using human fibrosarcoma and mouse myoblast cells and revealed that the non-muscle type of exon inclusion is a default type and that the muscle-specific exon exclusion required de novo protein synthesis of an intracellular protein factor (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24.Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering above, it is likely that this exonic enhancer element is necessary for constitutive splicing of F1γ in non-muscle tissues, and that a splicing factor for this enhancer element, such as SR proteins, is also required (Fig.8, left column). The negative regulation for selection of exon 9 in the F1γ gene was induced in low serum- or acid-stimulated cells (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24.Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also established that the nuclear extracts from post-induced cells contained a sequence-specific negative regulatory factor of exon selection by in vitro splicing assay (25.Hayakawa M. Endo H. Hamamoto T. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, a negative regulatory factor was induced, which in turn inhibited the constitutive splicing in F1γ-wt minigene in both myotubes and post-induced cells (Fig. 1 c). When the Pu-rich mutation was introduced at the middle region of the wild-type exon 9, induction of exon exclusion by acidic stimulation or differentiation medium was blocked (Fig. 3). From the result, this mutation likely affected the negative regulatory element on the exon. Alternatively, the Pu-rich mutation would make a new exonic splicing enhancer sequence. However, the Pu-rich mutant sequence resembles, but is not identical to, SF2/ASF-binding consensus element (41.Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition, this mutant sequence did not inactivate the enhancer element on the alternatively spliced exon, but inhibit the silencer activity in myotubes. Considering this, it is likely that the negative regulatory element located on the middle region of the exon (Fig. 8, middle column). This Pu-rich mutation on the exon did not work in skeletal and heart muscle tissues of the transgenic mice (Fig. 5 c). However, this mutation was observed to inhibit the exon exclusion not only in primary cultures of myoblasts from the transgenic mice (Fig. 7) but also in premature heart and skeletal muscle during fetal developmentin uteri (Fig. 6). These data indicated that there was a differential regulation of muscle-specific alternative splicing between myotubes and mature muscle fibers. When the Pu-rich mutation made the exonic silencer element inactivated, there were two possibilities to explain the difference of the splicing regulation between myotubes and mature muscle fibers. First, a negative regulatory factor that acts to the negative regulatory element would be different quantitatively or qualitatively between myotubes and myofibers. Second, a positive regulatory factor for the enhancer element would differ quantitatively or qualitatively. In fact, the amount of SR protein has been reported to differ among various tissues (38.Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 39.Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). For example, tissue distribution of rat SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 proteins have been reported (40.Hanamura A. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar). The above study found that the rat heart muscle contained only trace amounts of SF2/ASF. It is then likely that the protein level of a constitutive splicing factor is only decreased in mature muscle fibers, which in turn results in exon exclusion, even when the silencer element is inactivated (Fig. 8, right column). There are many muscle-specific alternative splicings in several genes,e.g. α- or β-tropomyosin, neural cell-adhesion molecule, myocyte-specific enhancer proteins, and F1γ. Although the development stage of myotubes is earlier rather than that of myofibers, most of muscle-specific alternative splicings were reported to appear at myotubes (23.Ichida M. Endo H. Ikeda U. Matsuda C. Ueno E. Shimada K. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8492-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our Pu-rich mutant minigene succeeded in clearly demonstrating the difference in splicing regulation between myotubes and mature muscle fibers. We have identified the splicing enhancer sequence of alternative splicing of F1γ pre-mRNA in vivo. This enhancer element is rich in purine nucleotides, exists on the alternatively spliced exon, and works to include this exon in myoblasts and non-muscle tissues. Muscle-type F1γ mRNA was created by the induction of a negative regulatory factor (25.Hayakawa M. Endo H. Hamamoto T. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), whereas a differential regulation of muscle-specific exon exclusion was present between myotubes and mature muscle fibers. To elucidate the exact mechanism underlying alternative splicing during myogenesis, muscle-specific splicing regulatory factors must be identified.

Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis established the presence of one and two dehydrobutyrine residues in mutacin II and the C15A variant, respectively, thus yielding the final structure. The results of this investigation showed that the C-terminal part contains three thioether bridges connecting Cys residues 15, 26, and 27 to Ser/Thr residues 10, 12 and 19, respectively, with Thr25 being modified to dehydrobutyrine. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry trypticase soy broth-yeast extract correlation spectroscopy dehydrobutyrine ions seen in a mass spectrum resulting from fragmentation from the N terminus ions seen in a mass spectrum resulting from fragmentation from the C terminus Lantibiotics, a subclass of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances elaborated by many Gram-positive bacteria, are biologically active peptides that contain post-translationally modified amino acids including the thioether amino acids lanthionine and β-methyllanthionine along with the dehydrated amino acids dehydrobutyrine and dehydroalanine (Fig. 1) (1.Sahl H.-G.

Microbiol. 1995; 17: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized as prepropeptides and post-translationally modified. The post-translational modifications are catalyzed by specific enzymes that are genetically organized in clusters with the respective structural genes (1.Sahl H.-G. Jack R.W. Bierbaum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 827-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2.de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. van der Meer J.R. Siezen R.J. Mol.

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The prepropeptides undergo dehydration of specific hydroxyamino acids to form dehydroamino acids with a Cα=Cβ double bond. This is followed by the formation of intramolecular thioether bridges via the addition of cysteine sulfur atoms to the β-carbon of the dehydroamino acid (Fig. 1). Based on structure and mode of action, lantibiotics fall into two subgroups: type A, screw-shaped peptides that disrupt membrane functions, and type B, globular peptides that act as enzyme inhibitors (1.Sahl H.-G. Jack R.W. Bierbaum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 827-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Mutacin II is a lantibiotic peptide secreted by Streptococcus mutans T8. It resembles many of the type A lantibiotics but differs in its antimicrobial mode of action (5.Chikindas M.L. Novak J. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Schilling K.M. Caufield P.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2656-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6.Novak J. Caufield P.W. Miller E.J. J.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The 3,245-Da peptide was previously isolated, and its genetic determinants were cloned from genomic DNA (8.Woodruff W.A. Novak J. Caufield P.W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 206: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutacin II structural gene (mutA) is followed by a gene encoding a modifying enzyme (mutM) and by ABC transporter (mutT). Other genes involved in regulation and immunity are clustered within this locus (9.Chen P. Qi F. Novak J. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete prepropeptide consists of 53 amino acids including the 26-amino acid amphipathic leader peptide with the G−2-G−1 sequence at the processing site. The prolantibiotic part of mutacin shows similarities with sequences of several type A II lantibiotics (2.de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. van der Meer J.R. Siezen R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8.Woodruff W.A. Novak J. Caufield P.W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 206: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Glycine in position 6 and asparagine and serine/threonine in positions 18 and 19, respectively (numbered according to mutacin), are conserved in mutacin II, lacticin 481, salivaricin A, variacin, and SA-FF22 (8.Woodruff W.A.

Also conserved are motifs T(I/V)(S/T) in positions 10–12, (E/D)C in positions 14 and 15, and a C-terminal motif of (V/L)(F/A)TCC. Mutacin II is composed of 27 amino acids, with the other four lantibiotics ranging from 22 to 27 residues. All five lantibiotics are capable of forming three thioether rings via three cysteine residues in the molecule. Unlike other lantibiotics, analysis of the amino acid sequence indicated that the N-terminal region of mutacin II, namely residues 1–8, appears uniquely able to form an amphipathic α-helix when projected on a helical wheel (16.Novak J. Chen P. Kirk M. Barnes S. Jablonsky M.J. Holaday S.K. Krishna N.R. Baker J. Caufield P.W. Protein Eng. 1997; 10 (suppl.): 87Google Scholar). This paper presents the biochemical and structural characterization of mutacin II and its engineered variant peptides using a combination of Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and chemical modifications. TheEscherichia coli strains used for subcloning and plasmid isolation were grown in LB medium in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics (17.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). S. mutans strains and Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176 were stored frozen at −70 °C until needed and grown as described previously in TSBY medium (6.Novak J. Caufield P.W. Miller E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4316-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added to the media when needed (for streptococci: kanamycin 500 μg/ml, tetracycline 5 μg/ml; for E. coli:kanamycin 50 μg/ml, tetracycline 12.5 μg/ml, ampicillin 50 μg/ml). E. coli plasmid and S. mutans T8 chromosomal DNA were prepared as described previously (17.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). S. mutans transformation was performed using the bovine serum albumin method (18.Shah G.R. Caufield P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The general technique used for gene replacement of the wild type mutacin gene with engineered C15A and C26A variants has been recently reported (19.Chen P. Novak J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C15A/C26A double mutant was generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described (19.Chen P. Novak J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a plasmid with the C15A mutacin gene variant as a template and the primer set (forward primer, CATGTTTTCACTGCTTGTTAAAAAATTAAAAATTATAACGG; reverse primer, TTTAATTTTTTAACAGCAGTGAAAACATGTTGCCATG). The identity of the introduced mutations was verified by DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer). The plasmid carrying the mutated gene was digested with XbaI and then transformed into S. mutans strain CBM0 (19.Chen P. Novak J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant transformants were analyzed for the desired reciprocal crossover by polymerase chain reaction analysis (19.Chen P. Novak J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutacin and its analogs were isolated using the ultrafiltration and selective precipitation method previously described (6.Novak J. Caufield P.W. Miller E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4316-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mutacin activity was assayed on TSBY agar plates using the deferred antagonism technique with S. sobrinus OMZ176 as the indicator strain (20.Caufield P.W. Childers N.K. Allen D.N. Hansen J.B. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified native peptide and trypsin-, CNBr-, or ethanethiol-treated peptides were sequenced by automated Edman degradation with a gas phase microsequencing system (model PI 2090E; Porton Instruments Inc., Tarzana, CA). The system was equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Purified mutacin analogs were analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API III; PE Sciex, Concorde, Ontario, Canada). MALDI-TOF1 MS experiments were carried out in the positive mode with delayed extraction technology (Voyager Elite; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The acceleration voltage was set at 25 kV, and 10–50 laser shots were summed. Sinapinic acid (Aldrich; catalog no. D13,460–0) dissolved in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1) was used as the matrix. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with bovine insulin. Samples were diluted 1:10 with matrix, and 1 μl was pipetted onto a smooth plate. Mutacin II (0.2 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 40% formic acid in acetonitrile. To this solution approximately 0.5 mg of CNBr was added (21.Miller E.J. Furuto D.K. Narkates A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reaction times of 1, 3, and 72 h were tested simultaneously to achieve complete and selective cleavage at methionine. Mutacin II was dissolved in 117 μl of formic acid-d, and a further 273 μl of acetonitrile-d 3 and 110 μl of water was added to make up a final volume of 500 μl. All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Instruments (Billerica, MA) WH-400 NMR spectrometer equipped with an Aspect 3000 computer. Data were collected at 303 K, and chemical shifts were referenced to internal acetonitrile. The COSY experiments were carried out in magnitude mode. All experiments used selective low power presaturation for water suppression. For all COSY experiments, 128 scans of 2,048 complex data points were collected for each of the 512 serial files. All NMR data were transferred to a Silicon Graphics Origin 200 server and processed using the Felix 97.2 program (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The data were processed using different combinations of window functions to obtain the best possible representation of the transformed spectra. The primary structure of mutacin II is composed of 27 amino acids. Post-translational modifications include the formation of two lanthionine, one methyllanthionine, and one α,β-dehydroamino acid residue (16.Novak J. Chen P. Kirk M. Barnes S. Jablonsky M.J. Holaday S.K. Krishna N.R. Baker J. Caufield P.W. Protein Eng. 1997; 10 (suppl.): 87Google Scholar). Edman degradation stopped after eight cycles, revealing the N-terminal part of the sequence NRWWQGVV-. Next, mutacin II was linearized by reaction with ethanethiol under alkaline conditions and again looked at by Edman degradation (7.Novak J. Kirk M. Caufield P.W. Barnes S. Morrison K. Baker J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Examination of the reaction products yielded the additional sequence -PXVXYEXRM. Sequencing of a peptide isolated from a trypsin digest of mutacin II provided the partially overlapping sequence -MNXWQHVF. Overall, 20 amino acid residues were identified from the results of Edman degradation. A summary of the Edman degradation results can be seen in TableI.Table IMutacin II sequence dataModificationSequence informationNoneNRWWQGVVEthanethiolNRWWQGVVPXVXYEXRMTrypsinNRWWQGVV MNXWQHVFDeduced from cloned geneNRWWQGVVPTVSYECRMNSWQHVFTCCThe amino acid sequence of mutacin II obtained by Edman degradation of the unmodified peptide, peptide reacted with ethanethiol, and peptide reacted with trypsin are presented.

The primary structure deduced from the DNA sequence of the cloned gene is also included. For details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, Edman degradation of the wild type molecule terminated after eight cycles. In other lantibiotics, sequencing by Edman degradation is often blocked by a dehydro residue (4.Sahl H.-G. Bierbaum G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In mutacin II, a proline follows Val8 and then is followed by a modified residue at position 10. In this case, the blocking of the sequencing cannot be attributed to a dehydro residue. A possible explanation is that proline preceding a bridging residue makes the Edman reaction sterically hindered and therefore sequencing cannot continue. Mutacin II and the C15A variant were investigated using electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis of the doubly charged ion of mutacin II as well as the C15A variant yielded a series ofb ions (m/z values 271, 457, 643, 771, 828, 928, 1027, 1124, 1207, and 1306 for b2 tob11), which corresponded to NRWWQGVVP-Dhb-V-, indicating that Thr10 is a modified residue (Fig.2). The 1207 signal, corresponding to N1-Dhb10, was barely visible above the noise in the wild type compared with a very strong peak in the C15A. This indicates that the N1-Dhb10 fragment is much less stable in the wild type and possibly results from the reduction of methyllanthionine during MS analysis. The theoretical as well as observed masses for all peptides studied can be seen in Table II. The entire sequence was later confirmed from the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned gene (8.Woodruff W.A. Novak J. Caufield P.W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 206: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Table I).Table IIMass spectral data of cleavage reactionsVariantUnreacted peptide massCNBr-cleaved peptide massFragmentsTheoryExpt.TheoryExpt.DaDaWild type (T8)3,2453,2453,2143,2141C15A3,2133,2143,1823,1831C26A3,2133,2152,0282,02821,1561,158C15A/C26A3,1813,1811,9951,99521,1561,156The mass spectral data of the wild type, C15A, C26A, and C15A/C26A variants and products of the CNBr cleavage are shown.

For details, see “Experimental Procedures.” It has been previously determined that mutacin II contains three thioether bridges and one dehydroamino acid (7.Novak J. Kirk M. Caufield P.W. Barnes S. Morrison K. Baker J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, mutagenesis studies confirmed that both the dehydrobutyrine residue and thioether bridges are required for the antimicrobial activity of mutacin II (16.Novak J. Chen P. Kirk M. Barnes S. Jablonsky M.J. Holaday S.K. Krishna N.R. Baker J. Caufield P.W. Protein Eng. 1997; 10 (suppl.): 87Google Scholar,19.Chen P. Novak J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Chen P. Novak J. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Protein Eng. 1997; 10 (suppl.): 82Google Scholar). However, the connectivity of these bridges was not obvious. The possible “partners” include cysteine residues at positions 15, 26, and 27 that pair with two serine and one threonine residues in positions 10, 12, 19, or 25. The cleavage of a peptide containing a single methionine residue with CNBr results in the net loss of 31 Da in molecular mass from the N-terminal fragment and the formation of two peptides. However, covalent linkages that span the methionine residue, such as the thioether bridges in lantibiotics, hold the peptide fragments together. Examination of the bridging pattern of mutacin II using MS analysis was carried out on the CNBr products of mutacin II and its variants generated by protein engineering, namely C15A, C26A, and the double mutant C15A/C26A. Analysis of the wild type molecule concluded that at least one bridge spanned the methionine. The result of cleavage by CNBr was a single peptide with molecular mass 31 Da less than the original (Table II, Fig. 3). Results from the C15A variant agreed with this finding. The cleavage product was a single molecule, thus indicating that a bridge must exist between any combination of Cys26 and Cys27 with Ser12 or Thr10 but not necessarily both (Table II). These results allowed the prediction of a series of possible structures that were then further resolved by MS analysis of the products from the CNBr cleavage of the C15A/C26A double mutant. Reaction of the C15A/C26A variant with CNBr yielded two peptides of molecular mass 1,995 and 1,156 Da (Table II). These mass fragments were consistent with the cleavage of the 3,181-Da molecule and loss of 31 Da as expected. The results also showed that the N-terminal fragment contained two dehydro residues, Dhb10 and dehydroalanine 12, which indicated that these residues were processed from Thr10 and Ser12 as in the wild type peptide. The dehydro residues remained unreacted due to the unavailability of a cysteine. Apparently, the unreacted dehydroamino acid residues remain as such and do not participate in the formation of alternative bridges. Tandem mass spectra of the doubly charged ions of the two peptides confirmed their identity (results not shown). Analysis of the 1,156-Da C-terminal peptide indicated a series of at least five peptides derived from a common cyclic structure by breaking it at different sites. These fragments would indicate that a thioether bridge is likely to connect Cys27 with Ser19. The possibility of a Cys27 to Ser19 bridge was further supported by the existence of two series of ions (b and y) from a peptide generated by sequential deletion of amino acids between Ser19 and Cys27 (results not shown). The possible bridging patterns were narrowed down to three (Fig.4), and the last peptide to be cleaved was the C26A variant. With Cys27 bridging with Ser19 and Cys26 bridging with Ser12or Thr10, the question at hand was the identity of Cys15's bridging partner. The next step was to determine whether its bridging partner was on the N- or C-terminal side of methionine. A product of two peptides would indicate no bridge spanning the methionine, thus Cys26 bridged to Tys10/Ser12 and Cys15 to Thr10/Ser12, putting the Dhb at position 25 (Fig. 4, a and b). A product of a single peptide would indicate that Cys15 must be linked to Thr25. Therefore, knowing the peptide has one Dhb, Cys26 must form a bridge with Ser12 (Fig.4 c). The MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of the cleaved C26A variant showed two peaks corresponding to the N-terminal and C-terminal cleavage products (Table II, Fig. 5). This indicated that two peptides were formed, narrowing down the possible structures to two: Cys26 linked to Ser12 and Cys15 linked to Thr10(Fig. 4 a) or Cys26 linked to Thr10and Cys15 linked to Ser12 (Fig.4 b).Figure 5MS data of C26A after the cyanogen bromide cleavage reaction. The upper panel shows the mass spectrum of the C26A variant after reaction with cyanogen bromide for 3 h. The middle spectrum shows the control sample after 72 h along with some oxidation products. Notice that the peaks at ∼3,200 Da seen in the first spectrum are virtually gone, and the appearance of peaks at 2,028 and 1,158, which represent the two fragments. The bottom spectrumis the sample prior to reaction. Notice how clean it is compared with the cleaved and control samples. For details, see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The last piece of evidence needed to define the bridging pattern was obtained using NMR spectroscopy. The COSY NMR spectrum of mutacin II showed a characteristic cross-peak corresponding to the Hβ-Hγ interaction of Dhb (6.74 ppm, 1.26 ppm) (Fig. 6 a). The COSY NMR spectrum of the C15A variant contained two cross-peaks corresponding to Dhb residues (6.65 ppm, 1.65 ppm and 6.64 ppm, 1.43 ppm) (Fig.6 b). This is indicative of the wild type mutacin containing one Dhb residue and the C15A variant containing two such residues. Since the C15A variant contained two Dhb residues, the only possibility left was that Cys15 is linked to Thr10 while Cys26 is linked to Ser12 (Fig. 4 a). Replacing the cysteine at position 15 with alanine removed the possibility of a bridge. Dhb10 then remained unreacted, thus yielding two of the characteristic peaks seen in Fig.6 b. The sequence of mutacin II along with the location of the thioether bridges can be seen in Fig.7 a.Figure 7Mutacin II compared with lacticin 481.The deduced bridging pattern of mutacin II is presented and shown to exhibit very high similarity to lacticin 481. The thick circles represent conserved residues, and thedashed circles represent residues in the same group. Thioether bridges are represented by S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As seen in the MS data, some of the peptides undergo substantial oxygenation. Differing degrees of oxygenation were observed between the peptide variants. This is possibly an indication of the accessibility of the various sulfur atoms to oxygenation. In mutacin II, oxygenation is seen, but in the C15A variant, the oxygenated species become more prominent. This trend continues in the C26A with the doubly oxygenated species being the dominant peak in the control sample. Additionally, the data presented shows a definite trend in oxygenation being greater in the samples that were reacted for longer periods of time. For example, the C26A sample is quite clean prior to the reaction (Fig. 5). Consequently, it is believed that the thioether sulfur atoms and the methionine sulfur in the uncleaved peptides are the sites of oxygenation. This is consistent with not seeing the series of peaks for oxygenated species in the N-terminal fragments (Fig. 5). The type A II lantibiotics include SA-FF22, lacticin 481, salivaricin A, and variacin (2.de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. van der Meer J.R. Siezen R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This group of peptides is thought to have the same bridging pattern but has only been proven for lacticin 481 and SA-FF22 (4.Sahl H.-G. Bierbaum G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23.van den Hooven H.W. Lagerwerf F.M. Heerma W. Haverkamp J. Piard J.-C. Hilbers C.W. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The structure of one of these, lacticin 481, has been published (23.van den Hooven H.W. Lagerwerf F.M. Heerma W. Haverkamp J. Piard J.-C. Hilbers C.W. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It, along with mutacin II, is comprised of 27 residues, but mutacin II lacks the C-terminal serine and has one extra residue at the N terminus (Fig. 7) (23.van den Hooven H.W. Lagerwerf F.M. Heerma W. Haverkamp J. Piard J.-C. Hilbers C.W. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lacticin 481 and the other type A II lantibiotics kill cells by disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane via pore formation, but mutacin II has been shown to utilize a different mechanism, one that inhibits the energy metabolism of sensitive cells (5.Chikindas M.L. Novak J. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Schilling K.M. Caufield P.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2656-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Also notable is the presence of proline 9 in mutacin II. Lacticin 481 does not contain this interesting structural element that has been shown to be pertinent for the biological activity of mutacin II (19.Chen P. Novak J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bridging pattern of mutacin II has been found to be identical to that of lacticin 481 and SA-FF22. The original structural study of lacticin 481 was based on NMR analysis. This study was able to narrow down the structure to two possibilities (11.Piard J.-C. Kuipers O. Rollema H.S. Desmazeaud M.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16361-16368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final covalent structure was then determined using a combination of methods including peptide chemistry, MS, and NMR (23.van den Hooven H.W. Lagerwerf F.M. Heerma W. Haverkamp J. Piard J.-C. Hilbers C.W. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Comparatively, in this study, the structure of mutacin II was determined via a different route. In this case, the powerful tool of protein engineering was utilized to narrow down the possible bridging patterns. This worked well, but like the original study of lacticin 481 it only was able to narrow down the possibilities to two. NMR spectroscopy was then used to resolve the final structure. Many of the structural features of mutacin II have been analyzed using a combination of protein engineering, chemical modification, mass spectrometry, and NMR. Since the thioether bridges in mutacin II appeared to be formed with high fidelity and were thus site-specific, the variant peptides provided excellent tools for structural studies. This report presents a novel and exciting approach using site-directed mutagenesis to determine the organization of thioether bridges in a lantibiotic peptide. The N-terminal portion of the molecule is coupled to the C terminus by a proline-methyllanthionine link that appears to be critical for antibacterial activity (19.Chen P. Novak J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Qi F. Caufield P.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal part contains three thioether bridges connecting Cys residues 15, 26, and 27 with Ser/Thr residues 10, 12, and 19, respectively. We thank Dr. Michael J. Jablonsky for help with the NMR measurements, Lori Coward for the MALDI-TOF MS measurements, and Kelly Morrison for the Edman degradation experiments."

However, it is unclear how this system is common in all eubacteria. We investigate the structure and properties of alphaCTD from an extremely thermophilic eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus (Tt). The solution structure of Tt alphaCTD (85 amino acids) was determined by NMR, and the interaction between Tt alphaCTD and DNA with different sequences was investigated by means of chemical shift perturbation experiments. The tertiary structure of Tt alphaCTD is almost identical with that of Ec alphaCTD despite 32% sequence homology. However, Tt alphaCTD interacts with the upstream region sequence of the promoter in the Tt 16 S ribosomal protein operon rather than the Ec UP element DNA. The upstream region sequence of Tt is composed of 25 base pairs with 40% AT, unlike the Ec UP element with 80% AT. The DNA binding site in Tt alphaCTD is located on the surface composed of helix 4 and the loop preceding helix 4. The electric charges on this surface are not remarkably localized like those of Ec alphaCTD."

In the self-compatible species maize,S gene family members are predominantly expressed in vegetative organs but are also expressed to a lesser extent in the stigma (silk). To determine if the expression of any S gene family members correlates with female receptivity, we analyzed their expression in developing maize silks. We show that a large family of maize S transcripts is expressed in developing silks. Surprisingly, we isolated a cDNA complementary to a large portion of the antisense strand of the maize receptor kinase Sdomain. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-polymerase chain reaction, RNase protection, and Northern hybridization with single-stranded riboprobes confirmed that natural antisenseS transcripts exist in leaves and seedling shoots and in all sexual tissues tested except mature pollen. These natural antisenseS transcripts co-exist with several less abundant senseS transcripts. The accumulation of sense and antisenseS transcripts is differentially regulated during pollen and silk development. Thus, these results support a role for Sgene family members in sexual tissue development and/or compatible pollination and reveal a new level of complexity in the regulation and function of the S gene family in maize.

S locus receptor kinase S locus glycoprotein rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction kilobases(s) nucleotide(s) open reading frame S locus-related glycoprotein Arabidopsis receptor kinase Flowering plants have evolved self-incompatibility systems that prevent or substantially reduce the level of self-fertilization. In the genus Brassica, at least two stigmatically expressed genes at the self-incompatibility locus or S locus are required for the recognition and the rejection of self pollen by the stigma: the S locus receptor kinase (SRK)1 and the S locus glycoprotein (SLG) genes. SRKand SLG genes encode, respectively, a receptor-like protein kinase and a secreted glycoprotein that is highly similar to the extracellular domain of SRK (reviewed in Refs. 1Nasrallah J.B. Nasrallah M.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2McCormick S. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This common domain in SRK and SLG is called the Sdomain. A number of S domain-related sequences, unlinked to the S locus, have been found in the Brassicagenome (3Dwyer K.G. Chao A. Cheng B. Chen C.H. Nasrallah J.B. Genome. 1989; 31: 969-972Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Suzuki G. Watanabe M. Toriyama K. Isogai A. Hinata K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1273-1280PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that SRK and SLG genes are two members of a large gene family, the Brassica S gene family (or S multigene family).Further studies have demonstrated that S domain-related sequences are not restricted to Brassica. To date,S gene family members that encode either secreted glycoproteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Nasrallah J.B. Nasrallah M.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or transmembrane receptor protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 5Braun D.M. Walker J.C. Trends Biochem.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)).Cell-cell signaling between pollen and stigma leading to the self-incompatibility response in Brassica has been extensively studied (reviewed in Ref. 9Cock J.M. Adv. Bot. Res. 2000; 32: 270-298Google Scholar), and the individual biological functions of the various S locus genes in self-incompatibility have been elucidated. Gain-of-function experiments have shown that SRK alone determines the Shaplotype specificity of the stigma and that SLG acts to promote a full manifestation of the self-incompatibility response (14Takasaki T. Hatakeyama K. Suzuki G. Watanabe M. Isogai A. Hinata K. Nature. 2000; 403: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the pollen S determinant that would provide the ligand for the SRK receptor has also been identified; it is unrelated to SLG or SRK but belongs instead to a family of genes encoding pollen coat proteins. This gene, termedSCR (S locus cysteine-rich protein) is a single copy, S locus-encoded, anther-expressed gene (15Suzuki G. Kai N. Hirose T. Fukui K. Nishio T. Takayama S. Isogai A. Watanabe M. Hinata K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 391-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schopfer C.R. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1920-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).In contrast to SLG and SRK, the biological functions of the other various S-like genes are still largely unknown. Distinct patterns of expression have now been described for different S gene family members (reviewed in (1Nasrallah J.B. Nasrallah M.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Different members are specifically expressed in reproductive tissues in self-incompatible as well as self-compatible species, but others are expressed predominantly in vegetative structures, so that it is obvious that the S gene family may have diverse roles in plants.Among the S gene family, genes expressed in reproductive tissues are thought to play essential roles in pollination (reviewed in Ref. 1Nasrallah J.B. Nasrallah M.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recent data support this hypothesis. InBrassica, S locus-related glycoprotein 1 (SLR1), not encoded at the S locus and specifically expressed in stigma, is involved in the pollen-stigma adhesion process (18Luu D.T. Marty-Mazars D. Trick M. Dumas C. Heizmann P. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 251-262PubMed Google Scholar) and interact specifically with new members of pollen coat proteins (19Takayama S. Shiba H. Iwano M. Asano K. Hara M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Hinata K. Isogai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3765-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Such S domain-related transcripts have been reported in self-compatible species such asArabidopsis (20Dwyer K.G. Lalonde B.A. Nasrallah J.B. Nasrallah M.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and maize (6Walker J.C. Zhang R. Nature. 1990; 345: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Zhang R. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The S gene family in maize includes an S receptor kinase,ZmPK1 (for Z ea m ays proteinkinase), and three additional Sdomain-related genes without the protein kinase domain,ZmSLRs (for Z. m ays Slocus related); all are predominantly expressed in vegetative organs. One or more of these ZmSLR genes is also expressed to a lesser extent in the maize stigma, the silk (6Walker J.C. Zhang R. Nature. 1990; 345: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,7Zhang R. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).For pollination success, the basic requirements are pollen viability and female receptivity. In maize, although parameters of pollen quality have been extensively described (21Kerhoas C. Gay G. Dumas C. Planta. 1987; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), little information is available concerning female receptivity at the molecular level. Female receptivity seems to rely principally on stigma receptivity, which corresponds to a precise developmental window of the silk (22Dupuis I. Dumas C. Plant Sci. 1990; 70: 11-19Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, our objective was to analyze the structure and expression of the S gene family in developing maize silks to determine if this gene family was related to the acquisition of female receptivity and further processes implicated in pollination success. We show that a large number of maize S transcripts are expressed in developing silks and that some of them are more highly expressed at the maximum of female receptivity. The cloning of the corresponding cDNAs surprisingly led to the isolation of a cDNA complementary to a large portion of the antisense strand of the S domain of ZmPK1, suggesting the presence of natural antisense S transcripts. Further experiments were designed to assess antisense S RNAs in maize tissues and to clarify the origin of these molecules. These experiments confirmed that severalS loci encode antisense RNAs. We show that the antisenseS transcripts co-exist with sense S transcripts. The developmental expression patterns of sense and antisense transcripts in male and female tissues show distinct cellular and spatial distribution, demonstrating a high level of complexity in the regulation and function of the S gene family in maize.DISCUSSIONWe have discovered novel members of the S gene family in maize and have shown that there are naturally occurring antisenseS transcripts including AS-ZmSLR, whose molecular cloning and initial characterization we have performed. The expression of antisense S transcripts in maize is abundant and is not peculiar to the A188 maize line. Antisense S transcripts in maize co-exist with several less abundant sense Stranscripts, and both are differentially regulated during pollen and silk development, some of them being tissue-specific. This work therefore greatly extends our knowledge about the S gene family in maize (7Zhang R. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Naturally Occurring S Antisense RNAsNaturally occurring antisense RNAs were first discovered in bacteria (38Simons R.W. Kleckner N. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 567-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and there is now ample evidence that posttranscriptional gene regulation via endogenous antisense transcripts controls diverse prokaryotic biological activities (39Wagner E. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Increasing numbers of naturally occurring antisense RNAs are also being found in a large variety of eukaryotic organisms, from slime molds to mammals (40Nellen W. Lichtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Atkins D. Arndt G.M. Izant J.G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar, 42Delihas N. Mol.

As these antisense RNAs are complementary to sense transcripts encoding proteins involved in extremely diverse functions and some of them are conserved between species, it strongly suggests that these endogenous antisense transcripts are not fortuitous and may play a general role in gene expression (40Nellen W. Lichtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Atkins D. Arndt G.M. Izant J.G. Biol. Chem.

Gene. 1998; 211: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To carry out this control, antisense transcripts may have diverse mechanisms of action and can control gene expression at several different levels: transcription (44Farrell C.M. Lukens L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3400-3408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 45Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J.

Cell. 1989; 59: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), mRNA stability (48Hildebrandt M. Nellen W. Cell. 1992; 69: 197-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and translation (49Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V.

Lee R.C. Ambros V. Cell. 1997; 88: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Moreover, antisense transcripts can considerably vary in size; they may or may not be capable of encoding a protein, and they may be cis- or trans-encoded (40Nellen W. Lichtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42Delihas N. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Vanhée-Brossollet C. Vaquero C. Gene. 1998; 211: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).In plants, the first report of natural antisense transcripts concerned antisense α-amylase RNAs in barley (53Rogers J.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other examples of endogenous antisense transcripts include the Bz2 locus (54Schmitz G. Theres K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), α-tubulin genes (55Dolfini S. Consonni G. Mereghetti M. Tonelli C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the MuDR regulatory transposon (56Joanin P. Hershberger R.J. Benito M.I. Walbot V. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in maize. Finally, at the Brassica S locus, a gene expressed only in anthers, SLA (57Boyes D.C. Nasrallah J.B. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the SRKgene (58Cock J.M. Swarup S. Dumas C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have been shown to be transcribed in both directions. Very little attention has been paid to the roles of these endogenous antisense transcripts in plant gene expression (59Mol J.N. van der Krol A.R. van Tunen A.J. van Blokland R. de Lange P. Stuitje A.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) despite the deliberate use of exogenous sense or antisense RNA in transgenic plants for the down-regulation of specific genes, which sometimes also leads to transgene-induced gene silencing. Molecular mechanisms involved in such silencing still remain to be precisely defined (60Baulcombe D.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 61Depicker A. Montagu M.V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 62Vaucheret H. Beclin C. Elmayan T. Feuerbach F. Godon C. Morel J.B. Mourrain P. Palauqui J.C. Vernhettes S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 651-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, endogenous genes appear to be silenced directly through the activity of antisense transcripts of a transgene (63Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 255-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 64Morino K. Olsen O.A. Shimamoto K. Plant J. 1999; 17: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas in other cases, the mechanism of silencing is more complex (65Jorgensen R.A. Que Q. Stam M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 11-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).What are the roles of the antisense S transcripts? First, endogenous S antisense RNAs transcripts may have no natural function. However, this seems unlikely in the present one, because two different antisense S transcripts are abundantly expressed in maize vegetative and sexual tissues. Moreover, similar endogenousS antisense RNAs derived from the SRK and related genes were found to a lesser extent in Brassica oleracea(58Cock J.M. Swarup S. Dumas C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that antisense transcription associated with S gene family members represents an evolutionarily conserved feature. Similarly, antisense transcription has been conserved for the bFGF gene in Xenopus, chicken, rat, and humans (66Volk R. Koster M. Poting A. Hartmann L. Knochel W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2983-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 67Murphy P.R. Knee R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 68Savage M.P. Fallon J.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 69Li A.W. Too C.K. Murphy P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the RAD10/ERCC-1 genes in yeast and humans (70van Duin M. van Den Tol J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Bootsma D. Rupp I.P. Reynolds P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1794-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the c-myb gene in chickens and humans (71Vellard M. Sureau A. Soret J. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2511-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that antisense transcripts may be important for gene function.Second, the antisense S transcripts might function by encoding protein(s). AS-ZmSLR, the major naturally occurringS antisense RNA in maize, has no long open reading frame and has some features characteristic of untranslated eukaryotic mRNAs. Nevertheless, our data do not address whether the two shortAS-ZmSLR ORFs are translated in vivo. Recent papers have emphasized the role of oligopeptides in plant signaling (72Marx J. Science. 1996; 273: 1338-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 73Bisseling T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For example, the gene ENOD40, expressed during the early stages of legume nodule development, was thought to act as a “riboregulator,” a novel class of untranslated RNA (74Crespi M.D. Jurkevitch E. Poiret M. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y. Petrovics G. Kondorosi E. Kondorosi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5099-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), until it was demonstrated that it encodes an oligopeptide of about 10 amino acids that probably has a primary role in the nodule organogenesis (75van de Sande K. Pawlowski K. Czaja I. Wieneke U. Schell J. Schmidt J. Walden R. Matvienko M. Wellink J. van Kammen A. Franssen H. Bisseling T. Science. 1996; 273: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,76Charon C. Sousa C. Crespi M. Kondorosi A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1953-1966PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, antisense S transcripts might serve as natural antisense regulator RNAs of ZmPK and ZmSLR gene expression, either transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally. BecauseAS-ZmSLR is complementary to the 5′ region upstream of the ATG of ZmPK1 mRNA, it is possible that promoter occlusion could occur to prevent transcription. It is also interesting to note that ZmPK1 was shown to be expressed predominantly in roots (6Walker J.C. Zhang R. Nature. 1990; 345: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Zhang R. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) where we did not detect any antisense transcripts, suggesting a complementary pattern of sense/antisense regulation already reported for several genes in animals (44Farrell C.M. Lukens L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3400-3408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 48Hildebrandt M. Nellen W.

Development. 1995; 121: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least one set of antisense and sense transcripts was shown to be cis-encoded at the AS-ZmSLR locus, which would potentially allow regulation of accumulation of their respective messages. On another hand, it is likely that antisense Stranscripts would not regulate splicing becauseZmPK1 has no intron (7Zhang R. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine how endogenous antisense S RNA transcripts could modulate the expression of ZmPK and otherZmSLR genes.Function of Multiple S Transcripts in Maize FlowersDespite their wide distribution in plants, precise functions of Sgene family members have only been assigned for SRK, SLG, and SLR in Brassica (14Takasaki T.

The only other members of the S gene family for which we have information concerning their possible function are two small families of S receptor-like kinases,Arabidopsis ARK (for Arabidopsis receptor kinase) involved in plant developmental processes (11Dwyer K.G. Kandasamy M.K. Mahosky D.I. Acciai J. Kudish B.I. Miller J.E. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1829-1843PubMed Google Scholar, 80Tobias C.M. Nasrallah J.B. Plant J. 1996; 10: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and Brassica SFR (for S family receptor), involved in response to mechanical and biological attack (81Pastuglia M. Roby D. Dumas C. Cock J.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To propose putative functions of multiple S transcripts in maize flowers, we have compared our data concerning the structure of the cloned S members and their specific expression patterns with accumulating data fromBrassica and other S gene family systems.The structure of the cloned AS-ZmSLR silk cDNA appears to be similar to a small group of closely related S genes of the sub-family SLR 3 (S locus related 3), described in self-incompatible B. oleracea (82Cock J.M. Stanchev B. Delorme V. Croy R.R. Dumas C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These genes share with AS-ZmSLR a high similarity with the S domain of the corresponding receptor kinase and the fact that the putative encoded S protein differs from most otherS family members by deletion of several of the highly conserved cysteine residues. In addition, SLR 3and AS-ZmSLR genes show similar patterns of expression, being expressed in vegetative tissues as well as in stigmas and in young developing anthers. This SLR 3 sub-family is thought to arise from modification of receptor kinase genes by deletion for generation of genes encoding secreted Sglycoproteins involved in several different cellular functions, perhaps as ancestral cell-cell communication systems adapted for multiple roles in the plant life cycle (82Cock J.M. Stanchev B. Delorme V. Croy R.R. Dumas C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Nothing is known onSLR 3 functions, but other secreted Sglycoproteins as SLR1 and SLG are now clearly involved in the pollen-stigma adhesion, as recently shown by a biomechanical assay in Brassica napus (18Luu D.T. Marty-Mazars D. Trick M. Dumas C. Heizmann P. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 251-262PubMed Google Scholar) and by isolation and characterization of pollen coat proteins that specifically bind to SLR1 of Brassica campestris (19Takayama S. Shiba H. Iwano M. Asano K. Hara M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Hinata K. Isogai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3765-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, multipleZmSLR silk transcripts can encode proteins that take part to pollen-stigma adhesion during maize pollination. The fact that higher levels of S transcripts are accumulated in developing silks at the maximum of female receptivity is consistent with this hypothesis.Our study of S gene expression has revealed that the most abundant S transcripts in all maize tissues (except roots and mature pollen) were antisense transcripts. In silks, these transcripts co-exist with several different S sense transcripts. Thus, abundant natural antisense RNAs could modulate in maize tissues the expression and turnover of ZmPK and otherZmSLR genes by one of the possible mechanisms described above. Of particular interest in the developing male sexual tissues, the sense and antisense transcripts showed complementary expression patterns, with antisense RNAs decreasing in abundance as the anther matures, whereas sense S-like transcripts were accumulating at the highest level in mature pollen. The apparent reciprocal relationship between the abundance of sense and absence of antisenseS transcripts in mature pollen supports the possibility of a regulatory role for the antisense transcript in control of male reproductive development, as described previously in animals for several developmental processes (51Ha I.

Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Our study is the first to report S-like transcripts in mature pollen, one of which is pollen-specific. The maize pollenS-like transcripts are rather divergent from other known maize S sequences (detected by Northern blot hybridization, not by RNase protection assay), so that pollen-expressed Sgenes might have been missed in previous searches. Further experiments must be done to study in more detail this pollen Stranscript, which could have a specific function either in pollen development and/or compatible pollination in maize.To conclude, our study has evidenced in maize a new set of Sgene family members showing, especially in flowers, a developmental and tissue-specific expression pattern and including abundant antisense transcripts. It will be important to determine the direction of transcription for previously described S gene family members in other species. In Brassica, the presence of three different antisense S transcripts has been confirmed (58Cock J.M. Swarup S. Dumas C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite their low abundance in this species, it would be worthwhile to consider that these endogenous antisense transcripts could be involved in S gene family regulation. In particular, this endogenous regulation sy"

The increase of the cell volume results in the activation of pathways that effect the reduction of osmotically active molecules and ions in the cytoplasm, thus leading to compensatory cell shrinkage (1.Lang F.

Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the expression cloning technique, we identified a protein (ICln) that, expressed inXenopus laevis oocytes, leads to a current that is similar to SAC found in several cell types in terms of its kinetics, pharmacology, and relative selectivity for anions (4.Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The assumption that ICln is functionally tightly linked to SAC is supported further by the finding that the knock-down of the ICln protein in fibroblasts and epithelial cells by the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides specific to ICln mRNA can seriously hamper the activation of swelling-dependent anion channels (5.Gschwentner M.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C182-C192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified two different human gene loci that carry the coding region for ICln. One locus at position 6p12, termed CLNS1B, contains an intronless gene (7.Nagl U. Erdel M. Bergmann F. Oehl B. Scandella E. Musante L. Galietta L.J.V. Gschwentner M. Fürst J. Schmarda A. Hofer S. Utermann G. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), whereas the second gene locus at position 11q13.5–14.1, termed CLNS1A, is segmented by introns. The exon sequences of CLNS1A are identical with the cloned human cDNA, suggesting transcription of this gene (8.Nagl O.U. Erdel M. Schmarda A. Seri M. Pinggera M.G. Gschwentner M. Duba C. Luis G.J.V. Deetjen P. Utermann G. Paulmichl M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because ICln is expressed ubiquitously and transcribed constitutively in mammalian cells (9.Abe T. Takeuchi K. Ishii K. Abe K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and volume regulation is an inherent regulatory entity of living cells, it seems likely that this protein is part of one of the housekeeping regulatory machineries of the cells. However, preliminary experiments indicate that this constitutive transcription of theCLNS1A gene is modulated by the volume stress placed upon the cells and, in addition, during their progression in the cell cycle. A prerequisite of the attempt to investigate these regulatory mechanisms for CLNS1A transcription is the identification of the promoter for the constitutive transcription of this gene. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of the ICln protein is remarkably high. Therefore, the identification of the minimal promoter region needed for its transcription should lead to the identification of a highly efficient human promoter that could also be used for an effective expression of other proteins in human cells. Such a promoter would be very instrumental in avoiding the use of viral promoters for the expression of proteins in human cells. To characterize the minimal promoter responsible for the constitutive expression of the ICln gene, we subcloned and analyzed the 5′-flanking region of the humanCLNS1A gene. By screening a human genomic P1 library (Ressourcen-Zentrum/Primär Datenbank RZPD library (10.Francis F. Zehetner G. Höglung M. Lehrach H. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1994; 11: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)) with a 700-bp cDNA probe specific to ICln, we isolated a clone termed P1R3 (the corresponding RZPD reference number is ICRFP700E1924Q). The 3′-end of this clone was sequenced and corresponded to the 5′-end of the humanCLNS1A gene (7.Nagl U. Erdel M. Bergmann F. Oehl B. Scandella E. Musante L. Galietta L.J.V. Gschwentner M. Fürst J.

Duba C. Luis G.J.V. Deetjen P. Utermann G. Paulmichl M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The P1R3 clone was digested withKpnI and SacI. The restriction enzyme products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for hybridization. They were subsequently probed using the 5′-end of the ICln open reading frame (ORF). This procedure led to the isolation of a ≈2.3-kilobase fragment from the P1R3 clone, which was cloned into a pBlueskript SK II+ vector thereafter. Sequencing analysis revealed that the clone carried 2151 nucleotides upstream from the first coding ATG and parts of exon 1 of the ICln gene. Standard PCR protocols with Taq or Pfupolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Stratagene) were used for parts of the deletion mutations as well as for the site-directed mutations. The 5′-flanking region of the 2151-bp fragment described above was cloned into the BglII and HindIII restriction sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) containing the gene for the firefly luciferase (isolated from Photinus pyralis). A size reduction of the 2151-bp fragment was obtained by using the restriction enzyme PvuII, the Erase-a-Base kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, or the PCR technique (see above). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by introducing the respective mutations into the primer used for PCRs. All promoter fragments were sequenced to test for the correct sequence before applying them to the reporter gene assays. To normalize the changing transfection efficacy, the different promoter constructs were cotransfected in HEK 293 T cells with the pRL-TK vector (Promega), containing the gene for theRenilla luciferase (isolated from Renilla reniformis) controlled by the viral TK promoter. All values of the reporter assay are given as the ratio obtained from the firefly andRenilla luciferase readings (luc/ren). The luciferase reporter gene constructs together with the pRL-TK plasmid were transfected into HEK 293 T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (11.Winklehner-Jennewein P. Geymayer S. Lechner J. Welte T. Hansson L. Geley S. Doppler W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1982Google Scholar). For this reason ≈105 HEK 293 T cells were spread on cell culture dishes with a diameter of 30 mm the day before transfection. For the transfection, 150 ng of promoter plasmid and 75 ng of pRL-TK vector were mixed with buffer A (0.5m CaCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 6.95; adjusted with NaOH) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, before adding buffer B (0.28 m NaCl, 0.75 mmNaH2PO4, 0.75 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 6.7; adjusted with NaOH). After a further incubation period of 10–20 min at room temperature, the transfection mix was spread over the cells. The next day the cells were washed twice with culture medium (see below). On the 3rd day the luciferase assays were carried out. To remove traces of culture medium, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed by adding 250 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm glycylglycin, 15 mmMgSO4, 8 mm EGTA, 2% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the cells were scraped off the culture dishes. The lysates were analyzed in a luminometer (EG&G Berthold) for both firefly and Renilla luciferase by mixing 50 μl of lysate with 350 μl of firefly or Renilla assay buffer and 200 μl of substrate-buffer for the firefly orRenilla luciferase, respectively. From the human mRNA, the first strand cDNA was made by using an ICln-specific primer (5′-TGT AGG GAT GTC CCC CTG TCC TTG-3′) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The reaction was heat inactivated and was then subjected to an RNase A treatment. Unincorporated nucleotides and enzymes were removed using a QIAquick PCR purification column (Qiagen). Polyadenosine tails were added to the 5′-end by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (MBI). Second strand synthesis was carried out by PCR usingTaq polymerase (MBI) and the primer RACE-N (5′-GCA TCG ATC GCG CGA CTC TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TT(AGC)-3′). For the first PCR, the gene-specific primer (5′-AGG TTC AAC ATC ATC ATC ACT GTC-3′) and the RACE-N primer were added to the reaction above, and a standard PCR protocol was carried out. To enhance specificity further, the PCR products were subjected to a second nested PCR using the primer RACE-N2 (5′-GCA TCG ATC GCG CGA CTC-3′, corresponding to the 5′-end of the primer RACE-N), and a second gene-specific nested primer (5′-AGA GCC ATC TAA CCA AGA CA-3′). The fragments obtained were subcloned and sequenced. The synthetic oligonucleotide primer (5′-ACA AAT GCT CTC CTA GAC AGT C-3′, starting within exon 2) was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI). The labeled primer was purified and annealed with poly(A)+ RNA from HEK 293 T cells. For the extension, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) was added. After RNase A treatment, the samples were loaded on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. A primer starting at position +87 (5′-CCC GTT CAG CAC AGC CTC-3′; +1 being the adenosine of the first ATG) labeled with IRD-800 was used for the reverse transcription, and the products were sequenced by an automatic sequencer (LiCor Gene ReadIR 4200, MWG Biotech). The IRD-800-labeled primer mentioned above, starting at +87, was employed for unidirectional PCR with a template ending at −224. This product was used as the antisense probe for the nuclease protection assay (Multi-NPA; Ambion), and the length of the products was analyzed by an automatic sequencer (LiCor Gene ReadIR 4200). Monkey genomic DNA was purchased fromCLONTECH. For the PCR two primers were used which were identical to the human ICln gene. With respect to the human gene, the primer started at position −783 (forward; 5′-GAA GAT CTT CTG ATT GGT TGG GTG GGA GAT G-3′) and +24 (reverse; 5′-CGG GAA ACT TTT GAG GAA GCT CAT-3′). The amplified fragment was subcloned and sequenced (see below). To test for the promoter efficacy of the −163/−74 fragment compared with the CMV or RSV promoter we analyzed the ICln protein expression in HEK 293 T cells using the corresponding promoter regions. The pGL3-basic vector was used after modifying the reporter region. Theluc + gene was replaced by the ICln coding region after attaching the nucleotide triplets coding for a sequence of five histidines prior to the starting methionine of ICln. This allowed us to purify the ICln protein derived from the translation of the extrachromosomal transcribed plasmid cDNA. The pGL3-basic vector replaced by His-ICln was termed His-ICln-basic and used for the subsequent admission of the respective promoter sequences. The −163/−74 fragment was cloned into the SmaI site, whereas the 654-nucleotide fragment of the CMV promoter was cloned into theNheI/XhoI sites and the 627-nucleotide fragment of the RSV promoter was cloned into the SacI/XhoI sites. The respective vectors were transfected into HEK 293 T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (11.Winklehner-Jennewein P. Geymayer S. Lechner J. Welte T. Hansson L. Geley S. Doppler W. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1982Google Scholar). For this reason ≈106 HEK 293 T cells were spread on cell culture dishes with a diameter of 90 mm the day before transfection. For the transfection, 7 μg of promoter plasmid was mixed with buffer A and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before adding buffer B. After a further incubation period of 10–20 min at room temperature, the transfection mix was spread over the cells. After 18 h the cells were washed twice with culture medium, and after an additional 6 h the cells were harvested, and cell lysis was performed using 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml of each leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, and aprotinin, in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 8.00). A total volume of 200 μl of supernatant was used for the extraction of His tag-fused ICln protein (Ni-NTA spin columns; Qiagen). Imidazole (400 mm imidazole, 50 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.40) was used for eluting the His-ICln. The extract was subjected to gel electrophoresis, blotted, and analyzed using antibodies specific for the ICln protein. The different Western blots were quantified using the ImageQuant (version 1.0) software (Molecular Dynamics), and the values were normalized according the total protein measurements (Bradford). HEK 293 T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 44 mm NaHCO3, 280 μm penicillin, 114 μm streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. All plasmids used were sequenced using an automatic sequencer (LiCor Gene ReadIR 4200) with the protocols suggested by the manufacturer. All chemicals used were of pro analysis grade. Where applicable, data are expressed as arithmetic means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was made by t test, where appropriate. Significant difference was assumed at p < 0.05. By screening a human genomic P1 library as described under “Experimental Procedures” with a 700-bp cDNA probe specific for ICln, we isolated a clone termed P1R3 (the corresponding RZPD reference number is ICRFP700E1924Q). The 3′-end of this clone was sequenced and corresponded to the 5′-end of the human ICln ORF (7.Nagl U. Erdel M. Bergmann F. Oehl B. Scandella E. Musante L. Galietta L.J.V. Gschwentner M. Fürst J. Schmarda A. Hofer S. Utermann G. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 8.Nagl O.U. Erdel M. Schmarda A. Seri M. Pinggera M.G. Gschwentner M. Duba C. Luis G.J.V. Deetjen P. Utermann G. Paulmichl M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using fluorescence in situhybridization, we located the P1R3 clone at the human chromosomal position 11q13.5–14.1, as expected. The P1R3 clone carries a >50-kilobase segment containing the 5′-untranslated region of theCLNS1A gene. To study the promoter activity ofCLNS1A, we subcloned and sequenced a 2.259-bpKpnI/SacI fragment from P1R3. This fragment was identified by hybridization with the 5′-end of the CLNS1AORF and corresponded to position −2151 to +108 of theCLNS1A gene (−1 being the first 5′-untranslated nucleotide of the human ICln cDNA, and +1 being the adenosine in the starting ATG of the ORF). Several human ICln cDNA clone sequences have been reported so far. For the different clones, 5′-untranslated regions of varying lengths have been described, i.e. −88 (accession number 4502890 (13.Buyse G. DeGreef C. Raeymaekers L. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Eggermont J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)), −84 this sequence was submitted by Lamb et al.), 2F. S. Lamb, T. Barna, and B. C. Schutte, GenBank™ accession number HSU53454.−73 (HSU17899 (14.Anguita J. Chalfant L.M. Civan M.M. Coca-Prados M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)), and −30 (AF005422 (15.Schwarz R.S. Rybicki A.C. Nagel R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Except for the sequence published by Anguita et al. (14.Anguita J. Chalfant L.M. Civan M.M. Coca-Prados M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), all of the other sequences are identical to ourKpnI/SacI fragment. The sequence published by Anguita et al. (14.Anguita J. Chalfant L.M. Civan M.M. Coca-Prados M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is perfectly matched by P1R3 up to position −41; however, the following 32 nucleotides located further upstream from this position show no homology to the P1R3 sequence or the cDNAs published by Buyse et al. (13.Buyse G. DeGreef C. Raeymaekers L. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Eggermont J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or Lambet al. 2 At present we cannot clearly determine whether the initial 32 nucleotides of the sequence published by Anguita are related to the ICln mRNA or whether they are the result of the cloning procedure used. The different lengths of the 5′-untranslated regions of the reported ICln cDNAs could indicate that multiple starting sites are used for the ICln gene transcription. To test this possibility, we performed several tests including primer extension, nuclease protection, and 5′-RACE using poly(A)+ RNA from HEK 293 T cells as a template. For the primer extension, the mRNA was annealed with a 5′-end 32P-labeled primer, designed to anneal within exon 2 of ICln, and the primer was extended using a Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Autoradiographic analysis of the primer extension products separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed products with a transcription start at positions −78 and −49. Using a primer starting at position +87, labeled with IRD-800, a predominant start for transcription at position −48 was measured. By using the 5′-RACE, we obtained three major products, which were subsequently sequenced. The respective transcripts started at positions −95 (two independent clones were isolated and sequenced), −78, −77, and −48, respectively. The transcription starts at the −78 and −48 clusters were also verified by using the nuclease protection assay. From these experiments we conclude that there are several starting points for human ICln gene transcription, thus providing an explanation for the varying 5′-untranslated sequences published for ICln so far. The ICln protein is expressed ubiquitously in mammals (4.Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9.Abe T. Takeuchi K. Ishii K. Abe K. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 1996; 218: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To identify the promoter responsible for this base-line expression, we used the luciferase reporter system (Promega) by transfecting HEK 293 T cells with promoter-luciferase vector constructs together with the Renilla pRL-TK vector for normalization. The first sequence tested was generated by PCR using theKpnI/SacI fragment as a template. The sequence was limited by the positions −2151 and −1 and was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic. As shown in Fig.1, this construct gives a signal that is more than 40-fold higher compared with the pGL3-basic vector containing no promoter sequences or foreign DNA (1.011 ± 0.1144luc/ren, n = 49 and 0.023604 ± 0.0072199, n = 51, respectively). The efficacy of the −2151/−1 fragment in driving expression is close to the efficacy of the viral TK promoter. This is supported by experiments in which the pGL3-TK vector (luciferase gene under the control of the TK promoter), cotransfected with the Renilla pRL-TK vector applying the same molar ratio as used for the fragment analysis, shows an activity that is only five times higher (5.291 ± 0.524luc/ren, n = 6). The cloning direction of the −2151/−1 fragment into the pGL3 vector is, as expected, important because a reporter construct containing a fragment (−568/+108) in the reverse direction showed no promoter activity (0.0041 ± 0.0005 luc/ren, n= 9). The reduction of the −2151/−1 fragment from the 5′- as well as from the 3′-ends leads to the fragment −783/−35, whose promoter activity is not significantly different from that of the −2151/−1 fragment (Fig. 1). Nested deletions from the 5′-end of the −783/−35 clone produced further five fragments, all of which display activities comparable to the activity of the −2151/−1 fragment (Fig. 1). These experiments suggest that the base-line promoter activity of ICln has to be associated with a fragment confined by the positions −167 and −35. Accordingly, the two fragments starting at position −162 and ending at position −783 and −2151, respectively, show no activity (Fig. 1). After the restriction of the −167/−35 fragment to −163/−56, there was no significant loss of activity compared with the former level (Fig. 2). However, further reduction of the 5′-end to position −154, −148, −135, or −126 decreased the activity by half. Therefore, the region between −163 and −150 was examined by site-directed mutagenesis to detect the nucleotides responsible for the ≈50% reduction of the promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 3, the mutants A−150G, T−154G, and −156CC−154/−156TT−154 show no reduction of the signal, whereas the mutant −159TTT−157/−159GCG−157 is associated with an activity not significantly different from that of the −154/−56 fragment (0.69 ± 0.1luc/ren, n = 15 for the mutant and 0.60 ± 0.1 luc/ren, n = 26 for the −154/−56 fragment). These experiments indicate that the thymidines at positions −157, −158, and −159 are most likely essential for half of the transcriptional capacity observed. The remaining half can be annihilated by further reduction of the 5′-end of the −126/−56 clone.Figure 3Single nucleotide mutations made in the region between positions −159 and −150. Mutation of the thymidine triplet −159TTT−157/−159GCG−157 leads to a reduction of the activity similar to that effected by a proximal deletion mutation to position −154.

Therefore, the thymidine triplet together with nucleotides comprising the string from −126 to −113 is necessary for the activity observed. By mutating the sequence between −126 and −113, further reduction of the essential sequence to single nucleotides was possible. As shown in Fig.5, the mutant A−119G/T−117G was not followed by a decrease in activity. However, the activity of the mutant −122CA−121/−122GG−121was significantly impaired. Accordingly, the reduction of the 5′-end to position −120 (fragment −120/−56) leads to an activity that does not deviate significantly from the value obtained by the transfection of the −122CA−121/−122GG−121 mutant. The activity produced by the transfection of the −120/−56 fragment can be annihilated by further reduction at the 5′-end to position −117 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Deletion mutations distal of position −126 and single mutations made between positions −122 and −117.Deletion mutations further distal of position −120 are followed by a reduction of the transcriptional efficacy not significantly different from the empty pGL3 vector.

An asterisk indicates the values taken from Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiments show that the base-line activity measured after the transfection of fragment −2151/−1 can be obtained when the thymidine triplet (−159TTT−157), the cytosine C−122 and adenosine A−121, and the guanine G−120 and thymidine T−118 are present. In addition to these nucleotides mandatory for the promoter activity, the presence of starting sites is also necessary because the fragment embraced by the positions −163 and −113 shows no activity compared with the empty pGL3 vector (0.0137 ± 0.00056 luc/ren,n = 6). As mentioned above, major transcription starts were identified at positions −95, −78/−77, and −49/−48. Surprisingly, the restriction of the 3′-end of the tested sequences to position −74, which therefore excludes a transcription start at position −49/−48, has a promoter activity similar to that of the −163/−1 fragment (Fig. 6), indicating that the critical sites for the transcription start are located upstream from position −74. This is also evidenced by the finding that four out of the five clones we have identified start at the −95 cluster (two clones) and the −78 cluster (two clones). Accordingly, the fragment starting at position −163 and ending at position −95,i.e. exactly at the most proximal end of the cDNA identified by 5′-RACE, leads to a signal not different from that of the empty pGL3 vector (Fig. 6). This indicates that the critical sequence for the transcription start is between positions −95 and −74. This stretch of nucleotides contains two pyrimidine-rich clusters with the CTTCC sequence. As shown in Fig. 7, these pyrimidine-rich clusters are perfectly conserved from humans to monkeys and mice (16.Wickman K. Seldin M.F. James M.R. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Genomics. 1997; 40: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). If the −78 cluster is omitted (fragment −163/−88), the transcription efficacy is half of that of the −163/−74 fragment (Fig. 6). The reduction of the same amount can be observed when the −78 cluster is present, and a mutation was introduced in the −95 cluster (−96CTTC−93/−96GGGG−93), thus suggesting that both pyrimidine-rich clusters are equally important for an effective transcription.Figure 7Comparison of the proximal 5′-genomic sequences of the genes coding for ICln in human, monkey, and mouse.
