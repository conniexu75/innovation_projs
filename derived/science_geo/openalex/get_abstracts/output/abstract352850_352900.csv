https://openalex.org/W2158484824,"A new metabolite profiling approach combined with an ultrarapid sample preparation procedure was used to study the temporal and spatial dynamics of the wound-induced accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and its oxygenated derivatives in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition to well known jasmonates, including hydroxyjasmonates (HOJAs), jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and its 12-hydroxy derivative (12-HOJA-Ile), a new wound-induced dicarboxyjasmonate, 12-carboxyjasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (12-HOOCJA-Ile) was discovered. HOJAs and 12-HOOCJA-Ile were enriched in the midveins of wounded leaves, strongly differentiating them from the other jasmonate metabolites studied. The polarity of these oxylipins at physiological pH correlated with their appearance in midveins. When the time points of accumulation of different jasmonates were determined, JA levels were found to increase within 2–5 min of wounding. Remarkably, these changes occurred throughout the plant and were not restricted to wounded leaves. The speed of the stimulus leading to JA accumulation in leaves distal to a wound is at least 3 cm/min. The data give new insights into the spatial and temporal accumulation of jasmonates and have implications in the understanding of long-distance wound signaling in plants.

Plant J. 2006; 46: 984-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Among the best characterized roles of JA and its metabolites are its actions in wounded tissues. Jasmonates control, directly or indirectly, the levels of an estimated 67–84% of herbivore-inducible transcripts (7Reymond P. Bodenhausen N. Van Poecke R.M.P. Krishnamurthy V. Dicke M. Farmer E.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3132-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). JA, or a related molecule may move and amplify jasmonate production in vascular tissues (8Schilmiller A.L. Howe G.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In the form of its methyl ester, JA may be transported over long distances within the plant to mediate systemic wound signaling (9Thorpe M.R. Ferrieri A.P. Herth M.M. Ferrieri R.A. Planta. 2007; 226: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Much of the JA synthesis occurring in response to attack seems to be associated with the vascular system (2Wasternack C. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2007; 100: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). In response to wounding, levels of the molecule in the wounded leaf greatly exceed levels in resting leaves, increasing up to at least 40-fold within 90 min after a single wound (10Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). After 90 min, JA levels start to subside, reaching half-maximal values ∼9 h after wounding (11Reymond P. Weber H. Damond M. Farmer E.E. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Given the potent signaling activity of certain derivatives of JA (12Staswick P.E. Tiryaki I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), a full elucidation of its turnover is essential for understanding how jasmonate levels are brought back toward resting levels subsequent to wounding. The biologically active jasmonic acid (+)-(3R,7S)-JA (cis configuration of the cyclopentanone ring) can be inactivated by epimerization in vivo to (–)-(3R,7R)-JA (trans) (13Holbrook L. Tung P. Ward K. Reid D.M. Abrams S. Lamb N. Quail J.W. Moloney M.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), providing a first line of deactivation of the signal. However, because this epimerization is reversible and at equilibrium some (+)-(3R,7S)-JA remains, JA must be cleared from the cell by other mechanisms. Over 10 metabolites resulting from JA modification have been detected in vivo (14Gfeller A. Farmer E.E. Science. 2005; 306: 1515-1516Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Modified JAs include biologically active amido adducts with amino acids such as, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). A JA-Ile derivative, hydroxylated on carbon 12 of the jasmonoyl moiety, was recently discovered (15Guranowski A. Miersch O. Staswick P.E. Suza W. Wasternack C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another set of modified JAs includes hydroxy JAs such as 12-hydroxyjasmonate and its sulfonate derivative (16Gidda S.K.

Van Dongen W. Esmans E.L. Van Onckelen H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). cis-Jasmone, not to our knowledge reported from Arabidopsis, may be an inactivated version of JA destined for clearance from the cell (18Koch T. Bandemer K. Boland W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1997; 80: 838-850Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). What is currently unclear for leaves is the spatial and temporal dynamics of the production of JA and its derivatives. Where and when are JA derivatives made? In which tissues or organs do they accumulate? Does this correlate with their physicochemical properties? A non-targeted metabolomic approach was used to study changes in metabolite profiles that occurred in response to wounding. The production of biologically active jasmonates occurred within a time frame clearly distinguishable from the production of oxygenated JA metabolites. To see where various jasmonates accumulated, midveins were dissected out of leaves and their jasmonate content compared with the jasmonate content of the leaf. Several polar derivatives of JA and JA-Ile were detected, including a novel highly oxygenated molecule. Accumulation in the midveins of the plants correlated with the polarity of the molecules. During the course of these experiments we noted apparent differences in the level of JA in resting leaves according to the protocol employed. Using ultrarapid harvesting and extraction, we found that systemic JA accumulation in response to a wound was far more rapid than previously assumed. Chemicals—Isopropanol was obtained from SDS (Peypin, France). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-grade acetonitrile and water from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) were used for the ultra-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) analyses. For semi-preparative isolation, solvents were HPLC-grade acetonitrile Chromanorm from VWR (Leuven, Belgium) and deionized water filtered on 0.22-μm membrane filters from Millipore AG. For capillary NMR (CapNMR) experiments, methanol-d4 (CD3OD; 99.8% atom deuterium) was obtained from Armar Chemicals (Buchs, Switzerland). Plant Growth, Wounding Experiments—Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia-0 (Col-0), the coi1–1 mutant (19Feys B.J.F. Benedetti C.E. Penfold C.N. Turner J.G. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), and the jasmonate response mutant opr3 in the Wassilewskija background (20Stintzi A. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10625-10630Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) were grown at 22 °C, 70% relative humidity, under 9 h of light/day at 100 μEm–2 s–1. For experiments presented in Figs. 2, 3, 4B, and 5, the Glauser et al. (21Glauser G. Guillarme D. Grata E. Boccard J. Thiocone A. Carrupt P.-A. Veuthey J.-L. Rudaz S. Wolfender J.-L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2008; 1180: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) sample preparation protocol was used. The rosette leaves on one half of the plant were crushed across the leaf apices with forceps, wounding ∼30% of the leaf area. Col-0 plants were exposed to light for 2 min, 5 min, 90 min, and 3, 6, and 24 h, after which wounded and distal leaves were separated and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. In separate experiments, local and distal central midveins were rapidly removed with a scalpel. Wounded leaves were also harvested at several short time points (5, 15, 45 min). The opr3 mutant was wounded and harvested after 90 min. For quantitative experiments in Fig. 4A, the Weber et al. (10Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) protocol was used. In these experiments Col-0 and the coi1–1 mutant were wounded, weighed, and harvested after 5, 15, 30, and 90 min.FIGURE 2Spatial and temporal dynamics of JA and JA derivatives in wounded tissues of Arabidopsis.A–E, time course over 24 h.

Isopropanol was employed as a solvent for the extractions prior to UPLC-TOF-MS analyses and semi-preparative chromatography. Crude extracts were evaporated to dryness and weighed. A solid phase extraction was used to remove very polar compounds and apolar pigments (21Glauser G. Guillarme D. Grata E. Boccard J. Thiocone A. Carrupt P.-A. Veuthey J.-L. Rudaz S. Wolfender J.-L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2008; 1180: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Enriched extracts were diluted in final volumes proportional to their initial masses, allowing the injection of equivalent amounts of extracts in constant injection volumes. UPLC-TOF-MS analyses were performed on a Micromass-LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer from Waters (Milford, MA) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface coupled with an Acquity UPLC system from Waters. ESI conditions were capillary voltage 2800 V, cone voltage 40 V, source temperature 120 °C. Detection was performed in negative ion mode in the m/z range 100 to 1000 Da. The detection limit (3 times signal-to-noise ratio) for JA was 15 pmol/g of fresh leaves (i.e. equivalent to that obtained by gas chromatography MS with Weber et al. (10Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and Mueller et al. (22Mueller M.J. Mene-Saffrane L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) protocols). Response linearity of TOF-MS was confirmed for JA between 0.5 and 500 pmol injected. The separations were carried out on Waters Acquity UPLC columns (BEH C18: 1.0 × 50 and 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 μm) with the following solvent system: A = 0.1% formic acid-water, B = 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile. The gradient elution was performed at a flow rate of 300 μl/min under these conditions: 5% B for 0.3 min, 5–98% B in 6.7 min, and holding at 98% B for 3 min (1.0 × 50 mm); 5% B for 8.9 min, 5–98% B in 92.8 min, and holding at 98% B for 18 min (2.1 × 150 mm). For the isocratic separations of 11- and 12-HOJA, respectively, 12-HOJA-Ile and 12-HOOCJA-Ile, the conditions were A/B (92:8, v/v) and A/B (85:15, v/v) at 300 μl/min. For the gradient analysis (2.1 × 150-mm column) at physiological pH, A was replaced by an aqueous ammonium acetate buffer in water, 20 mm, pH 7.2, and B by acetonitrile. MS/MS experiments were conducted on a Micromass quadrupole TOF Premier mass spectrometer from Waters. A collision energy ramp was applied from 15 to 35 eV. Argon was used as collision gas at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Semi-preparative Liquid Chromatography MS Jasmonate Isolation—Monitoring was performed on a Finnigan MAT (San Jose, CA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ700) equipped with a Finnigan electrospray ionization interface and coupled to a Varian modular HPLC system (Palo Alto, CA) with a Varian 9012 pump. Electrospray ionization conditions were capillary temperature 200 °C, source voltage 4.5 kV, acquisition in negative ion mode, full scan m/z 100–1000 Da, scan time 1 s. The isolation was achieved in isocratic mode using two Waters Xbridge BEH C18 columns (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm) coupled in series. The isocratic conditions were identical to those used in UPLC-TOF-MS except for the flow rate (2.0 ml/min). An adjustable flow splitter Quicksplit from ASI (El Sobrante, CA) was used to split 1:50 of the flow to the MS detector. CapNMR Measurements—CapNMR analyses were performed on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz NMR instrument (Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a 5-μl microflow CapNMR probe from Protasis/MRM Corp. (Savoy, IL) having an active volume of 2.5 μl. The samples were dissolved in 6.5 μlof CD3OD and parked in the probe with a push volume of 9 μl. The signal of CD3OD (1H 3.31 ppm, 13C 49.00 ppm) (23Gottlieb H.E. Kotlyar V. Nudelman A. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 7512-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (2862) Google Scholar) was used as reference (temperature 30 °C). JA Quantification—The kinetics of JA accumulation in the wounded leaves of wild type (WT) and coi1–1 (19Feys B.J.F. Benedetti C.E. Penfold C.N. Turner J.G. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) were first established with the Weber et al. (10Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) protocol combined with an oxygen-18 JA internal standard (22Mueller M.J. Mene-Saffrane L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This procedure was then compared with the ultrarapid harvesting, extraction, and analysis described by Glauser et al. (21Glauser G. Guillarme D. Grata E. Boccard J. Thiocone A. Carrupt P.-A. Veuthey J.-L. Rudaz S. Wolfender J.-L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2008; 1180: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and herein. Profiling of Oxygenated Fatty Acids by UPLC-TOF-MS Metabolomics—A non-targeted metabolomic approach using UPLC-TOF-MS was devised to search for wound-inducible metabolites in A. thaliana (24Grata E. Boccard J. Glauser G. Carrupt P.A. Farmer E.E. Wolfender J.L. Rudaz S. J. Sep. Sci. 2007; 30: 2268-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The profiles of wounded and unwounded WT leaves (Col-0 accession) as well as those of the JA synthesis mutant opr3 (20Stintzi A. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10625-10630Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) in the Wassilewskija background were compared for the detection of jasmonates. Time series experiments (up to 24 h after wounding) were carried out to study the dynamics of jasmonate accumulation in wounded leaves and midveins. Additional time points (up to 45 min) were investigated in wounded leaves to evaluate shorter term metabolite accumulation related to wounding. Because a large number of analyses were conducted, a rapid UPLC method was devised. The main criteria for the search for jasmonates were strong induction in wounded Col-0 samples relative to control Col-0 samples and absence in control and wounded mutant opr3. A differential data treatment of the UPLC-TOF-MS analyses applied to all samples revealed the presence of known jasmonates in wounded Col-0 plants, such as JA (retention time (Rt) 2.41 min; m/z 209.1176; error 1.0 ppm), JA-Ile (Rt 3.04 min; m/z 322.2026; error 2.5 ppm), and JA-glucose (Rt 1.95 min; m/z 371.1695; error 3.0 ppm), as well as unidentified induced compounds of higher polarity. In particular, deprotonated molecules [M-H]– of m/z 225.1121 (Rt 1.37 min), m/z 338.1974 (Rt 2.05 min), and m/z 352.1757 (Rt 2.05 min) were detected. Molecular formulae could be deduced for these compounds with a good degree of confidence. C12H17O4 was associated to m/z 225.1121 (error 2.7 ppm), indicative of a hydroxylated jasmonic acid (HOJA). The ion m/z 338.1974 was defined as C18H28NO5 (error 2.1 ppm) and m/z 352.1757 as C18H26NO6 (error 0.9 ppm). Complementary MS/MS experiments using quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed a leucine or isoleucine moiety (m/z 130.0869; error 0.8 ppm) for m/z 338.1974 and m/z 352.1757. Fig. 1, A and B, shows the MS/MS product ion spectra of both ions. Compared with JA-Ile fragmentation, the neutral loss for the transition m/z 338.1974, >m/z 130.0869 (208.1106 Da), differed by one oxygen atom (15.9949 Da) and could be related to HOJA. In the case of m/z 352.1757, the difference of 29.9742 Da (+2 oxygens and –2 hydrogens in molecular formula) suggested further oxidation of the JA moiety. However, the complete characterization of both compounds had to rely on CapNMR (25Olson D.L. Norcross J.A. O'Neil-Johnson M. Molitor P.F. Detlefsen D.J. Wilson A.G. Peck T.L. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and thus their isolation from larger quantities of wounded plant material (500 g) was needed. Isolation and Identification of Oxygenated Jasmonates—Chromatographic conditions for isolation were optimized using UPLC-TOF-MS and then transferred geometrically to semi-preparative scale according to previously reported procedure (21Glauser G. Guillarme D. Grata E. Boccard J. Thiocone A. Carrupt P.-A. Veuthey J.-L. Rudaz S. Wolfender J.-L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2008; 1180: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For m/z 225.1121, four peaks were detected and isolated (1, 2, 3, and 4, Rt 170.6, 176.9, 182.1 and 187.9 min, respectively), corresponding to four putative isomers of hydroxyjasmonic acid. Two isomers were separated for both m/z 338.1974 (5 and 6, Rt 325.9 and 339.3 min, respectively), and m/z 352.1757 (7 and 8, Rt 332.0 and 358.6 min, respectively). Based on CapNMR spectra, 1 was assigned to 11-hydroxyjasmonic acid with a cis (Z) configuration of the cyclopentanone ring (cis-11-HOJA). Compound 2 was characterized as the corresponding trans (E) isomer (trans-11-HOJA). Absolute configuration assignment was not possible by NMR. The cis form was assumed to be (+)-(3R,7S) and the trans form (–)-(3R,7R) in accordance with known configurations for JA (13Holbrook L. Tung P. Ward K. Reid D.M. Abrams S. Lamb N. Quail J.W. Moloney M.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The same statement is valid for all other compounds described in this report. A modification of the hydroxyl position was observed for compound 3, which was defined as cis-12-HOJA. Finally, compound 4 was the trans-12-HOJA. The complete 1H and 13C signal assignments for compounds 1-4 are summarized in Table 1. Cis-12-HOJA (3) appeared to be much more abundant than trans-12-HOJA (4). Purified compound 3 was slowly converted into 4 after a few days in MeOH solution, which confirmed the cis (unstable) and trans (stable) configuration of 3 and 4, respectively. We observed small amounts of 11-HOJA in commercial JA samples. To ensure that 11-HOJA formation was not artifactual in our experiments, JA solutions were purified by HPLC and subjected to the sample preparation and analytical procedure. No trace of 11- or 12-HOJA was detected. Spiking experiments involving the addition of JA to control plants just before extraction did not lead to detectable artifact formation.TABLE 1Capillary NMR signal assignments of cis and trans forms of 11-HOJA, 12-HOJA, 12-HOJA-Ile, and 12-HOOCJA-IlePositiontrans-11-HOJAtrans-12-HOJAtrans-12-HOJA-Iletrans-12-HOOCJA-Ileδ HaReference for protons (methanol δ H, 3.31 ppm).δ CbReference for carbon (methanol δ C, 49.00 ppm).δ HaReference for protons (methanol δ H, 3.31 ppm).δ CbReference for carbon (methanol δ C, 49.00 ppm).δ HaReference for protons (methanol δ H, 3.31 ppm).δ CbReference for carbon (methanol δ C, 49.00 ppm).δ HaReference for protons (methanol δ H, 3.31 ppm).δ CbReference for carbon (methanol δ C, 49.00 ppm).1****2a/b2.57cFor cis-11-HOJA, δ H, 2.66 ppm./2.32m40.512.64dFor cis-12-HOJA, δ H, 2.80 ppm./2.31m39.542.64eFor cis-12-HOJA-Ile, δ H, 2.83 ppm./2.27m41.682.74fFor cis-12-HOOCJA-Ile, δ H, 2.79 ppm./2.15m42.22339.282.31m38.952.35m39.622.29m40.334a/b2.26/1.56m27.912.25/1.54m27.882.18/1.58m27.802.16/1.58m27.755a/b2.35/2.12m38.252.33/2.10m38.152.33/2.08m38.382.32/2.08m38.256****71.98m54.991.97m54.861.97m55.271.97m55.3282.43m26.352.39m26.242.39m26.352.40m26.1695.33mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.127.465.46mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.128.825.44mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.128.805.43mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.128.81105.43mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.136.695.48mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.128.825.48mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.128.805.67mgSelective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond.128.81114.63m63.922.30m31.572.32m31.683.09m*121.18d (6.0)23.433.55m62.333.56m62.30*1′4.29m*4.29m*2′1.88m38.831.88m*3′a/b1.56/1.19m25.901.56/1.20m25.954′0.92t (7.5)11.930.92t (7.5)11.855′0.95d (7.5)16.200.95d (7.5)16.34a Reference for protons (methanol δ H, 3.31 ppm).b Reference for carbon (methanol δ C, 49.00 ppm).c For cis-11-HOJA, δ H, 2.66 ppm.d For cis-12-HOJA, δ H, 2.80 ppm.e For cis-12-HOJA-Ile, δ H, 2.83 ppm.f For cis-12-HOOCJA-Ile, δ H, 2.79 ppm.g Selective decoupling performed by irradiation of methylene H-11 and H-8 demonstrated a (Z) configuration (H-9/H-10, J = 11 Hz) of the double bond. Open table in a new tab NMR Characterization of Jasmonate Conjugated with Isoleucine and a Novel Jasmonate—CapNMR experiments enabled the assignment of the substructure corresponding to 12-HOJA for both 5 and 6. As for 3 and 4, the difference between both isomers was due to an epimerization of the cyclopentanone ring from a cis (6) to trans (5) configuration. The conjugated amino acid was identified as isoleucine in HSQC and COSY experiments. Therefore, 5 and 6 were determined as trans and cis 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid conjugated with isoleucine (12-HOJA-Ile). Table 1 presents all 1H and 13C signal assignments for both epimers. CapNMR spectra of 7 and 8 were very similar to those of 5 and 6. The only significant difference was a shift of the methylene H-11 (δ 3.09) compared with that of 5 and 6 (δ 2.32) and the absence of signal for proton at C-12. The olefinic proton H-10 was also slightly shifted down field (δ 5.67). A COSY experiment showed a correlation between the methylene H-11 (δ 3.09) and the olefinic H-10 (δ 5.67). The molecular formula (C18H26NO6) deduced from TOF-MS measurement indicated that compared with 12-HOJA-Ile (C18H28NO5), an additional oxygen was present and two hydrogens were missing. From CapNMR, this difference in MS could be only explained by a carboxylic group at C-12. Furthermore, the shift of H-11 (δ 3.09) was in accordance with a carboxylic acid at C-12 and a double bond at C-9/10. Table 1 shows all detected 1H and 13C signal assignments for 7 and 8. Compounds 7 and 8 were thus identified, respectively, as trans and cis 12-carboxyjasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (12-HOOCJA-Ile). As with 3, 4, 5, and 6, a slow transformation from 8 to 7 within a few days was observed. Fig. 1C summarizes all structures for compounds 1–8.

https://openalex.org/W2127609477,"The mechanisms that allow Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to persist in human tissue for decades and to then abruptly cause disease are not clearly understood. Regulatory elements thought to assist Mtb to enter such a state include the heme two-component sensor kinases DosS and DosT and the cognate response regulator DosR. We have demonstrated previously that O(2), nitric oxide (NO), and carbon monoxide (CO) are regulatory ligands of DosS and DosT. Here, we show that in addition to O(2) and NO, CO induces the complete Mtb dormancy (Dos) regulon. Notably, we demonstrate that CO is primarily sensed through DosS to induce the Dos regulon, whereas DosT plays a less prominent role. We also show that Mtb infection of macrophage cells significantly increases the expression, protein levels, and enzymatic activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, the enzyme that produces CO), in an NO-independent manner. Furthermore, exploiting HO-1(+/+) and HO-1(-/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages, we demonstrate that physiologically relevant levels of CO induce the Dos regulon. Finally, we demonstrate that increased HO-1 mRNA and protein levels are produced in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. Our data suggest that during infection, O(2), NO, and CO are being sensed concurrently rather than independently via DosS and DosT. We conclude that CO, a previously unrecognized host factor, is a physiologically relevant Mtb signal capable of inducing the Dos regulon, which introduces a new paradigm for understanding the molecular basis of Mtb persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2033616412,"Glutathione (GSH), a major intracellular antioxidant, plays a role in NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, which is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether GSH levels are altered in the posterior medial frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients. Furthermore, we examined correlations between GSH levels and clinical variables in patients.Twenty schizophrenia patients and 16 age- and gender-matched normal controls were enrolled to examine the levels of GSH in the posterior medial frontal cortex by using 3T SIGNA EXCITE (1)H-MRS with the spectral editing technique, MEGA-PRESS. Clinical variables of patients were assessed by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), and five cognitive performance tests (Word Fluency Test, Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Digit Span Distractibility Test). Levels of GSH in the posterior medial frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients were not different from those of normal controls. However, we found a significant negative correlation between GSH levels and the severity of negative symptoms (SANS total score and negative symptom subscore on BPRS) in patients. There were no correlations between brain GSH levels and scores on any cognitive performance test except Trail Making Test part A.These results suggest that GSH levels in the posterior medial frontal cortex may be related to negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Therefore, agents that increase GSH levels in the brain could be potential therapeutic drugs for negative symptoms in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2033831018,"Background Current recommendations to prevent malaria in African pregnant women rely on insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp). However, there is no information on the safety and efficacy of their combined use. Methods 1030 pregnant Mozambican women of all gravidities received a long-lasting ITN during antenatal clinic (ANC) visits and, irrespective of HIV status, were enrolled in a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, to assess the safety and efficacy of 2-dose sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). The main outcome was the reduction in low birth weight. Findings Two-dose SP was safe and well tolerated, but was not associated with reductions in anaemia prevalence at delivery (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.79–1.08]), low birth weight (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.70–1.39]), or overall placental infection (p = 0.964). However, the SP group showed a 40% reduction (95% CI, 7.40–61.20]; p = 0.020) in the incidence of clinical malaria during pregnancy, and reductions in the prevalence of peripheral parasitaemia (7.10% vs 15.15%) (p<0.001), and of actively infected placentas (7.04% vs 13.60%) (p = 0.002). There was a reduction in severe anaemia at delivery of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.055). These effects were not modified by gravidity or HIV status. Reported ITN's use was more than 90% in both groups. Conclusions Two-dose SP was associated with a reduction in some indicators, but these were not translated to significant improvement in other maternal or birth outcomes. The use of ITNs during pregnancy may reduce the need to administer IPTp. ITNs should be part of the ANC package in sub-Saharan Africa. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00209781"
https://openalex.org/W2045499302,"We report the identification of three new collagen VI genes at a single locus on human chromosome 3q22.1. The three new genes are COL6A4, COL6A5, and COL6A6 that encode the alpha4(VI), alpha5(VI), and alpha6(VI) chains. In humans, the COL6A4 gene has been disrupted by a chromosome break. Each of the three new collagen chains contains a 336-amino acid triple helix flanked by seven N-terminal von Willebrand factor A-like domains and two (alpha4 and alpha6 chains) or three (alpha5 chain) C-terminal von Willebrand factor A-like domains. In humans, mRNA expression of COL6A5 is restricted to a few tissues, including lung, testis, and colon. In contrast, the COL6A6 gene is expressed in a wide range of fetal and adult tissues, including lung, kidney, liver, spleen, thymus, heart, and skeletal muscle. Antibodies to the alpha6(VI) chain stained the extracellular matrix of human skeletal and cardiac muscle, lung, and the territorial matrix of articular cartilage. In cell transfection and immunoprecipitation experiments, mouse alpha4(VI)N6-C2 chain co-assembled with endogenous alpha1(VI) and alpha2(VI) chains to form trimeric collagen VI molecules that were secreted from the cell. In contrast, alpha5(VI)N5-C1 and alpha6(VI)N6-C2 chains did not assemble with alpha1(VI) and alpha2(VI) chains and accumulated intracellularly. We conclude that the alpha4(VI)N6-C2 chain contains all the elements necessary for trimerization with alpha1(VI) and alpha2(VI). In summary, the discovery of three additional collagen VI chains doubles the collagen VI family and adds a layer of complexity to collagen VI assembly and function in the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2084786488,"It has been shown that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is critical in the generation of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)-inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs) from naïve CD4(+)T cells. However, in contrast to natural Tregs, TGF-beta1-induced iTregs rapidly lose both Foxp3 expression and suppression activity. We found that TGF-beta1-induced Foxp3 levels were maintained by the addition of the anti-interleukin 4 (IL-4) antibody or by STAT6 gene deletion. Thus, IL-4 is an important suppressor of Foxp3 induction, and T helper 2 development is a major cause for the disappearance of iTreg during long culture. Using promoter analysis in EL4 cells and primary T cells, we identified a silencer region containing a STAT6 binding site. STAT6 binding to this site reduced TGF-beta1-mediated Foxp3 promoter activation and chromatin modification. Retinoic acid has also been shown to suppress loss of Foxp3 induced by TGF-beta1. Retinoic acid in the presence of TGF-beta1 reduced STAT6 binding to the Foxp3 promoter and enhanced histone acetylation, thereby reverting the effect of IL-4. We propose that antagonistic agents for neutralizing IL-4 could be a novel strategy to facilitate inducible Treg cell generation and the promotion of tolerance in Th2-dominated diseases such as allergy."
https://openalex.org/W1980360785,"Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of local protein synthesis for neuronal plasticity. In particular, local mRNA translation through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been shown to play a key role in regulating dendrite excitability and modulating long-term synaptic plasticity associated with learning and memory. There is also increased evidence to suggest that intact adult mammalian axons have a functional requirement for local protein synthesis in vivo. Here we show that the translational machinery is present in some myelinated sensory fibers and that active mTOR-dependent pathways participate in maintaining the sensitivity of a subpopulation of fast-conducting nociceptors in vivo. Phosphorylated mTOR together with other downstream components of the translational machinery were localized to a subset of myelinated sensory fibers in rat cutaneous tissue. We then showed with electromyographic studies that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduced the sensitivity of a population of myelinated nociceptors known to be important for the increased mechanical sensitivity that follows injury. Behavioural studies confirmed that local treatment with rapamycin significantly attenuated persistent pain that follows tissue injury, but not acute pain. Specifically, we found that rapamycin blunted the heightened response to mechanical stimulation that develops around a site of injury and reduced the long-term mechanical hypersensitivity that follows partial peripheral nerve damage - a widely used model of chronic pain. Our results show that the sensitivity of a subset of sensory fibers is maintained by ongoing mTOR-mediated local protein synthesis and uncover a novel target for the control of long-term pain states."

Two classes of microbial enzymes, the [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases, catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen according to the reaction, H2 ⇔ 2H+ + 2e-. A third class, the [Fe] (formally “[FeS] cluster-free”)-hydrogenases, heterolytically split hydrogen into H- and H+ and transfer the former to their substrate (1Shima S. Thauer R.K. Chem. Rec. 2007; 7: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although these proteins are phylogenetically unrelated, they share the presence of one or two iron ions coordinated by CN- and/or CO ligands (2Bagley K.A. Duin E.C. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.

This observation emphasizes the requirement of maturation machineries in order to obtain active enzymes for each of the three classes. Nothing is known about the assembly of the active site FeCO2 unit in [Fe]-hydrogenases for which a structure has been recently reported. 3R. Thauer, personal communication. The maturation system of [NiFe]-hydrogenase is by far the most studied and the best understood, although many aspects of the process remain still unresolved (for an extensive review, see Böck et al. (7Bock A. King P.W. Blokesch M. Posewitz M.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2006; 51: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar)). It has been established that the carbamoylphosphate is a precursor that reacts with HypE, forming a -Cys-S-CN intermediate, which, in turn, transfers CN- to the prospective active site iron ion. Carbon isotopic labeling experiments indicate a different route for active site CO synthesis (8Roseboom W. Blokesch M. Bock A. Albracht S.P.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but its nature has not yet been elucidated (9Forzi L. Hellwig P. Thauer R.K. Sawers R.G.

Once the FeCO(CN)2 unit is put together, the GTPase HypB mediates nickel binding to the conserved CXXC motif of the C-terminal region of the large subunit, a specific nickel-containing endopeptidase cleaves an amino acid stretch at the C-terminal end, and the active site is fully assembled, deeply buried in the [NiFe]-hydrogenase structure (7Bock A. King P.W. Blokesch M. Posewitz M.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2006; 51: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has been known for over 20 years that overexpression of the structural Desulfovibrio vulgaris [FeFe]-hydrogenase genes in Escherichia coli, which lacks an endogenous [FeFe]-hydrogenase, produces inactive enzyme, devoid of the active site [FeFe] center (5Voordouw G.

Amino acid sequence analyses and functional tests show that HydF is a [Fe4S4] cluster-containing GTPase (17Brazzolotto X. Rubach J.K. Gaillard J. Gambarelli S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 769-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which, by analogy with HypB in [NiFe]-hydrogenases (7Bock A. King P.W. Blokesch M. Posewitz M.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2006; 51: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), may be involved in the active site [FeFe] subcluster insertion (Scheme 1B). The specific functions of HydE and HydG in hydrogenase maturation also remain to be established. Both belong to the recently identified superfamily of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) radical enzymes (18Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E.

Typically, AdoMet radical enzymes use an invariant reduced [Fe4S4] cluster to cleave the cofactor and produce a highly reactive and versatile 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical species (5′-Ado·) (20Frey P.A. Booker S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Especially relevant to the synthesis of DTN is the sulfur insertion to normally inert carbon atoms, as catalyzed by BioB (biotin synthase), LipA (lipoate synthase), and MiaB (21Ugulava N.B.

These three AdoMet radical proteins are thought to use an additional [FeS] cluster as the sulfur donor (24Ugulava N.B. Sacanell C.J. Jarrett J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8352-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Prior to their identification as [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturases, hydE genes were annotated as coding for biotin synthases (and they still are in most data bases), because their respective protein sequences share over 40% similarity. Because HydE from Thermotoga maritima (TmHydE) has a second [FeS] cluster (25Rubach J.K. Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it was tempting to suggest that it is involved in the biosynthesis of the small bridging active site putative DTN (Scheme 1B). However, as will be further discussed below, the cysteine residues that coordinate the second [FeS] cluster are not conserved in all hydE gene sequences (7Bock A. King P.W. Blokesch M. Posewitz M.C.

Here, we report two high resolution x-ray structures of TmHydE, with and without an additional [Fe2S2] cluster, respectively. By monitoring the effect on recombinant hydrogenase activity of amino acid substitutions in HydE, we have identified several putative key functional residues in the latter. In addition, through molecular docking in silico and small ions binding in the crystals, we have defined a minimal substrate-binding region including a plausible carboxylate recognition site. Finally, we have identified two additional anion-binding sites, one found halfway between the active site and the bottom of the protein β-barrel and another one near it that binds thiocyanate with very high affinity. Crystallization—The protein was purified, and the [FeS] clusters were subsequently reconstituted as previously described (25Rubach J.K. Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Prior to crystallization, the protein was incubated with 2 mm AdoMet (an 8-fold molar excess) and 6 mm CHAPSO. Hanging drops were prepared by mixing 2 μl of a TmHydE solution at 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl with 2 μl of a solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 200 mm lithium sulfate and were kept in an anaerobic glove box (Jacomex) at 20 °C. Crystals that grew in about 2 weeks were cryoprotected using a solution containing 18% glycerol, 6 mm CHAPSO, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm lithium sulfate, 30% polyethylene glycol. Anaerobic flash cooling of the crystals was carried out inside the glove box as previously described (26Vernede X. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 505-509Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Data Collection and Phasing—All of the x-ray data sets were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Table 1). The structure was solved by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method using the iron and sulfur atoms present in the native protein. In order to minimize the anomalous signal errors, a total of 290 frames with Δϕ = 1° were collected at λ = 1.71 Å. Data were processed using MOSFLM (27Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), scaled with SCALA (4Lyon E.J. Shima S. Boecher R. Thauer R.K. Grevels F.-W. Bill E. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14239-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and reduced using TRUNCATE (28CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Initial anomalous scattering atoms positions were obtained from the F3 data set using the SAD method with SHELXD (29Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). The resulting model corresponded to four iron atoms and one sulfur atom. These sites were then refined using SHARP (30Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 215-230Google Scholar); the final anomalous scattering model consisted of six iron and 21 sulfur atoms. Subsequent refinement, phasing, and solvent flattening gave maps that were of good enough quality to allow the structure determination. Subsequent data sets were processed with XDS (31Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 41-55Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar), and special care was taken to keep the same set of reflections for the Rfree calculation in all cases.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCrystalF3K11K5M1O4Data collection Data setFeS-SADNo Fe2S2Fe2S2/ThiocyanateBromideIodide BeamlineID29ID14-eh1ID14-eh1ID23-2ID14-2 Cell parameters (Å)50.63 78.79 85.9650.97 79.23 85.9450.93 79.73 86.0851.17 79.86 86.6651.19 79.25 85.83 Wavelength (Å)1.710.930.930.8730.933 Resolution (Å)2.281.351.71.71.35 Rsym0.047 (0.154)0.056 (0.422)0.076 (0.413)0.090 (0.334)0.030 (0.416) I/σ32.2 (11.45)16.5 (2.8)15.9 (3.4)17.7 (4.3)24.39 (2.85) Completeness (%)97.1 (90.0)99.4 (96.7)95.8 (95.8)99.3 (99.0)90.2 (59.1) Multiplicity5.8 (5.2)4.2 (3.1)6.6 (5.2)5.6 (5.3)3.7 (3.1)Refinement statistics Rcryst0.1430.1470.1460.152 Rfree0.1770.1830.1840.179 No. of reflections Work set68,44733,67037,36967,033 Test set3837189319973572 Root mean square deviation from ideal geometry Bonds (Å)0.0110.0110.0110.010 Angles (degrees)1.6221.5981.5671.569 No. of nonhydrogen atoms3449334434463448 Water molecules426363421426 Iron atoms4674 Others192203202191 Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure of TmHydE was solved by the SAD method using x-ray data collected from native crystals at the high energy side of the iron absorption edge (despite the significant amino acid sequence similarities between TmHydE and BioB from E. coli, no molecular replacement solution was found when using the latter as a search model). Iron atom positions were determined from Patterson maps using SHELXD (29Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined with SHARP (30Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 215-230Google Scholar). The resulting phases, extended to 1.77 Å resolution, were of good enough quality to build the initial model. Model Building and Refinement—Ten cycles of automated building with ARP/wARP (32Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and refinement using REFMAC (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) at 1.35 Å resolution resulted in a model containing 312 of a total of 346 residues placed in density with the correct sequence. After several cycles of manual model building using Coot (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), the model was completed by adding residues 2–17, 297–306, and 346–347, the FeS clusters, the AdoMet/AdoHCys, the Cl- ions, five detergent molecules, one glycerol, over 400 water molecules, and the modeling of alternative conformations of several side chains. This model was refined using REFMAC (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), generating the final atomic coordinate set. The relative occupancies of the second [FeS] cluster atoms were determined based on B factor refinement and comparison with the relative occupancies of the alternative conformations of the side chain of Cys322. Soaking Experiments—Soaks of TmHydE crystals with different small molecules were carried out using cryosolutions containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 5–100 mm concentration of one of the following molecules: formamide, formate, thiocyanate, cyanate, cyanide, carbamoylphosphate, phosphate, cysteine, pyruvate, asparagine, succinamate, maleamate, glycine, acetate, and lactate. These molecules were considered to be either plausible substrates, products, precursors, or their fragments. Dimethylamine could be a precursor of the small bridging active site molecule DTN, whereas propanedithiol corresponds to an analog of it. Glycine has been proposed to be a precursor for both CO and CN- ligands (35Peters J.W. Szilagyi R.K. Naumov A. Douglas T. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and carbamoylphosphate is the source of CN- in [NiFe]-hydrogenases (36Reissmann S. Hochleitner E. Wang H. Paschos A. Lottspeich F. Glass R.S. Bock A. Science. 2003; 299: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Carbamate and phosphate both correspond to fragments of carbamoylphosphate. Formamide, cyanate, thiocyanate, and cyanide are putative substrate, intermediate, and product in CN- synthesis. Succinamate, maleamate, acetate, lactate, pyruvate, and asparagine correspond to biologically relevant ligands or their fragments, selected from the docking experiment. Crystals were soaked in these solutions for no more than 5 min prior to flash cooling. As an alternative to crystal soaking, in order to test if diffusion of the molecule is the rate-limiting step, some of these molecules were tested for binding by co-crystallization. HydE Mutagenesis and [FeFe]-Hydrogenase Maturation in E. coli—Since no in vitro test is available to check the effect of point mutations on TmHydE activity, all of the tests were performed on the C. acetobutylicum HydE protein, using an in vivo assay that measures the relative amount of active hydrogenase produced. TmHydE and C. acetobutylicum HydE share 52% identity (180 amino acids) and 71% similarity (246 amino acids) scattered throughout the sequences (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, point mutation effects on C. acetobutylicum HydE can be reasonably extrapolated to TmHydE. For expression of active [FeFe]-hydrogenase in E. coli, the pET Duet plasmid (Novagen), containing C. acetobutylicum hydA1 in MCS I and C. acetobutylicum hydE in MCS II, and the pCDF Duet plasmid (Novagen), containing C. acetobutylicum hydF in MCS I and C. acetobutylicum hydG in MCS II were transformed into E. coli strain BL-21 (DE3) (Novagen) with co-selection for Apr (pET Duet) and Smr (pCDF Duet) colonies. Site-directed mutations were generated in hydE using the XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both the hydA and hydE genes were sequenced (Davis Sequencing, LLC) to confirm the presence of the desired mutation in hydE and to ensure that no unintended PCR-induced mutations were present. Transformed cells were grown overnight in LB medium (Sigma) and antibiotics. Cells were then diluted 100:1 in fresh LB medium containing antibiotics and grown with constant shaking at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5–0.7. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and cultures were shaken at 100 rpm at room temperature for 2 h. Cultures were then transferred to 130-ml serum vials, which were sealed with rubber septa and flushed with argon at room temperature overnight. [FeFe]-hydrogenase activity was then measured by adding 1.0 ml of anaerobic 2× whole cell reaction buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm methyl viologen, 5 mm dithionite, 3 mm NaOH) to an argon-purged serum vial (13 ml) sealed with a rubber septum, followed by the addition of 1.0 ml of induced E. coli cells. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and headspace gas was removed at various times with gas-tight syringes to assay H2 levels using gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5820). Anomalous Scattering Labeling—In order to probe the putative anion-binding sites, crystals were flash-cooled within 5 min from a solution containing 100 mm NaBr. X-ray diffraction data were subsequently collected at a slightly higher energy than the absorption edge for bromine. In another experiment, the protein was co-crystallized with NaI, and the crystal was flash-cooled within 5 min in a cryoprotecting solution containing NaCl. The fraction of remaining bound I- was determined by measuring the residual x-ray anomalous signal at λ = 0.933 Å. The relative occupancy was then refined, applying B factors similar to those of surrounding atoms. Docking of Small Molecules—The docking experiment was carried out using the software GLIDE (37Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6462) Google Scholar) from the SCHRODINGER® package. The ligand library was built from the ZINC data base (38Irwin J.J. Shoichet B.K. J. Chem. Inform. Model. 2005; 45: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar) using -2 ≤ net charge ≤ +1 and 20 Da ≤ mass ≤ 150 Da as selection criteria. This led to a subset of about 20,000 molecules that was subsequently treated with LIGPREP in order to build all of the alternative diastereoisomers of the selected molecules at pH 7 ± 2. The receptor grid was prepared using the protein preparation wizard on the protein coordinates. Special care was taken to describe the cofactor correctly. The less occupied side chain alternative positions as well as all of the ions, detergent, and water molecules were deleted from the file. Structure—The final 1.35 Å resolution structure, which was determined by the SAD method, contains 347 of the 348 protein residues and 426 solvent and 5 detergent molecules and has excellent refinement statistics and stereochemistry (Table 1). As previously suggested by amino acid sequence analyses (11Posewitz M.C. King P.W. Smolinski S.L. Zhang L. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25711-25720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 19Nicolet Y. Drennan C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), TmHydE has a distorted triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM)-barrel fold (Fig. 1). Comparison with Biotin Synthase and Other AdoMet Radical Proteins—Overall, HydE is significantly similar to E. coli BioB (supplemental Fig. 2); the superposition of both enzymes gives a root mean square deviation of 2.5 Å for 292 of 348 Cα atoms. As expected, the patches of conserved residues in HydE that differ from those from BioB are mainly found at the internal face of the β-strands that define the barrel (19Nicolet Y. Drennan C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). They are likely to be responsible for both substrate binding and reactivity. The two additional α-helices at the N-terminal end of the TIM barrel in the TmHydE structure (residues 17–25 and 32–47) have counterparts in E. coli BioB (residues 9–17 and 20–35) as previously suggested by sequence comparisons (19Nicolet Y. Drennan C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2). The two additional helices contact the TIM-barrel helix 6 that in both proteins is composed of several invariant hydrophobic side chains and either one arginine or lysine residue (19Nicolet Y. Drennan C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This amphipathic pattern has been also observed in the amino acid sequences of other AdoMet radical proteins, such as ThiH, PylB, CofG, and CofH (19Nicolet Y. Drennan C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L.

Xu H. White R.H. Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 180: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This, in turn, confirms the prediction that these proteins belong to an AdoMet radical “subclass” characterized by a complete TIM-barrel fold and a buried active site suitable for small substrate(s) (19Nicolet Y. Drennan C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L.

As in BioB, in the TmHydE crystal structure the loop connecting β-strand 8 to α-helix 8 (residues 293–318 in TmHydE; supplemental Fig. 2) covers one end of the barrel and may act as a lid controlling access of substrate and cofactors to the active site (43Berkovitch F. Nicolet Y. Wan J.T. Jarrett J.T. Drennan C.L. Science. 2004; 303: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This lid loop contains the strictly conserved YXXY motif (from Tyr303 to Tyr306 in TmHydE; supplemental Fig. 2), which could play a role in either catalysis or structure stability. A Patch of Detergent Molecules Covers a Region of HydE that could Interact with the Other Maturases—It has been proposed that HydE, HydF, and HydG form a ternary complex that contains at least the preassembled [FeFe] center of the FeFe-hydrogenase active site (13McGlynn S.E. Ruebush S.S. Naumov A. Nagy L.E. Dubini A. King P.W. Broderick J.B. Posewitz M.C. Peters J.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This ternary complex is the only species isolated in vitro capable of producing an active hydrogenase. The x-ray structure of TmHydE has a surface region covered by several ordered detergent molecules. The superposition of the TmHydE and E. coli BioB structures indicates that this region of TmHydE matches the monomer-to-monomer contact zone in the E. coli BioB dimer. Based on amino acid sequence analyses, it is likely that HydG, the other AdoMet radical maturase, is structurally very similar to HydE, including the N-terminal extra helices. Therefore, the detergent-containing region in the crystal might be involved in a heterodimeric interaction between HydE and HydG in the in vivo maturation ternary complex (purified TmHydE is monomeric both in solution and in the crystals). This hypothesis should be tested by complementary studies in solution. [Fe4S4] Cluster Geometry—A comparison between the conserved [Fe4S4] cluster in TmHydE and the high resolution structure of the classical [Fe4S4] cluster from C. acidiurici ferredoxin (44Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16065-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 2FDN) reveals a slight distortion of the former, corresponding to a transition of the unique iron atom coordination from tetrahedral to pseudo-octahedral (supplemental material and supplemental Table 1). AdoMet Binding—Although the TmHydE preparations were incubated with purified AdoMet after anaerobic reconstitution of the clusters (25Rubach J.K. Brazzol"
https://openalex.org/W2086541364,"Background Vitellogenin (Vg), a major reproductive protein, has been associated with infection-resistant response in fish. However, the underlying mechanisms by which Vg is involved in anti-infectious response are not understood. Methodology/Results By both protein-microbe interaction analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as phagocytosis test, we demonstrate for the first time that fish Vg acts as a pattern recognition molecule with multiple specificities that can recognize bacteria as well as fungus rather than self components from fish, and functions as an opsonin that can enhance macrophage phagocytosis. Conclusions This study shows that fish Vg plays an integrative function in regulating immunity via its pleiotropic effects on both recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and promoting macrophage phagocytosis. It also supports the notion that factors normally involved in control of female reproduction are associated with immunity in organisms that rely on Vg for oocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W2012977801,"The dimeric molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required for the activation and stabilization of hundreds of substrate proteins, many of which participate in signal transduction pathways. The activation process depends on the hydrolysis of ATP by Hsp90. Hsp90 consists of a C-terminal dimerization domain, a middle domain, which may interact with substrate protein, and an N-terminal ATP-binding domain. A complex cycle of conformational changes has been proposed for the ATPase cycle of yeast Hsp90, where a critical step during the reaction requires the transient N-terminal dimerization of the two protomers. The ATPase cycle of human Hsp90 is less well understood, and significant differences have been proposed regarding key mechanistic aspects. ATP hydrolysis by human Hsp90α and Hsp90β is 10-fold slower than that of yeast Hsp90. Despite these differences, our experiments suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms are highly similar. In both cases, a concerted conformational rearrangement involving the N-terminal domains of both subunits is controlling the rate of ATP turnover, and N-terminal cross-talk determines the rate-limiting steps. Furthermore, similar to yeast Hsp90, the slow ATP hydrolysis by human Hsp90s can be stimulated up to over 100-fold by the addition of the co-chaperone Aha1 from either human or yeast origin. Together, our results show that the basic principles of the Hsp90 ATPase reaction are conserved between yeast and humans, including the dimerization of the N-terminal domains and its regulation by the repositioning of the ATP lid from its original position to a catalytically competent one.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). ATP-binding by Hsp90 triggers a ring-shaped conformation, in which the N-domains interact with each other via a strand exchange mechanism, in addition to the permanent dimerization of the C-domains. This is achieved by exchanging the first β-strand and the first α-helix between the two N-domains. This conformation, which is required for productive ATP hydrolysis, had been proposed for yeast Hsp90 on the basis of biochemical experiments (13Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G.

Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Both crystallographic and biochemical data show in addition that a lid structure (“ATP lid”) within the N-domain closes over the nucleotide binding site upon ATP binding, and this movement initiates the N-terminal dimerization reaction (11Ali M.M.

For other Hsp90 homologues, this conformation has not been demonstrated unambiguously. Furthermore, for human Hsp90, evidence exists that it does not even form this conformation, and instead both subunits hydrolyze ATP in an uncoordinated manner (17McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Besides the proposed differences in the ATP hydrolysis cycle, differences have also been proposed for the interaction of yeast and mammalian Hsp90 with their co-chaperones (18McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Co-chaperones are an important part of the eukaryotic Hsp90 machinery, required for the maturation of client proteins. Some co-chaperones have been identified as regulators of ATP turnover. In yeast, the co-chaperones Sba1 and Sti1 both inhibit the ATPase activity (19Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Sti1 binds to Hsp90 in the open conformation with the N-domains not being associated (21Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10328-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas Sba1/p23 binds to the closed conformation in which the N-domains are dimerized (13Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Richter K. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol.

A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In human Hsp90, these co-chaperones appear to act differently. Hop, the Sti1 homologue, apparently does not influence the ATPase activity of human Hsp90 (18McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25970-25976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and p23, the Sba1 homologue, is thought to bind independently to both protomers in a conformation that does not necessarily require N-terminal dimerization (17McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).This leaves us with the puzzling situation that the ATPase cycle of human Hsp90 seems to be different from that of other family members, such as yeast Hsp90 and the recently analyzed Grp94 (12Dollins D.E. Warren J.J. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 41-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Frey S. Leskovar A. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35612-35620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here, we set out to reinvestigate the ATPase mechanism of human Hsp90 with a view to determine to what extent similarities exist between the mechanisms of ATP turnover in yeast Hsp90 and in human Hsp90. Previously, we had established several specific assays for the analysis of the Hsp90 ATPase, including the formation and analysis of Hsp90 heterodimers (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Richter K. Moser S. Hagn F. Friedrich R. Hainzl O. Heller M. Schlee S. Kessler H. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11301-11311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This allowed us to combine different Hsp90 constructs in one dimer and analyze the contribution of specific elements or domains to its ATPase activity. We employed this approach here to determine whether structural elements in human Hsp90 function in a similar manner, when compared with yeast Hsp90. According to our data, the basic principles, including the N-terminal dimerization and the mechanism of the ATP lid, are conserved between the two eukaryotic proteins. In addition, also the mechanism of interaction with the co-chaperone Aha1 and its stimulatory efficiency is conserved between species. Our results finally also allow us to draw conclusions regarding the basis for the dramatically slower turnover rate of human Hsp90, compared with its yeast homologue.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Constructs—Constructs for bacterial expression were based on the plasmids pET28b-yAha1, pET28b-hAha1, pET23-Hsp90α, and pET9-Hsp90β. Hsp90β was also purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (26Weikl T. Abelmann K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Yeast Aha1 was cloned after PCR amplification from yeast DNA into the corresponding expression vector by recombinant DNA technology. Plasmids for human Aha1 and both human Hsp90 homologues were a kind gift from David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). All of the plasmids were sequenced, and the sequence was confirmed to correspond to the sequence in the public data bases. Human Hsp90α matched the genome sequence BC108695, and human Hsp90β matched the genome sequence P08238.The deletion constructs His6-lidless human Hsp90α (hHsp90α), His6-lidless hHsp90β, His6-MC-hHsp90α, His6-C-hHsp90β, and His6-MC-hHsp90β were generated by PCR using the full-length plasmid sequences. For lidless hHsp90α and lidless hHsp90β, the amino acid stretches covering the ATP lid (Ser113–Gly137 and Thr110–Gly132, respectively) were replaced by a Ser-Gly-Ser linker. Lidless constructs were generated by linker-PCR and cloned into the pET28b expression plasmid using NheI and NotI restriction sites. MC-constructs (starting at amino acid Lys278 and amino acid Lys270 for hHsp90α and hHsp90β, respectively) and the C-construct for hHsp90β (from amino acid 537 to 724) were generated by PCR amplification and inserted into the pET28b expression vector by NdeI/NotI (MC-hHsp90β and His6-C-hHsp90β) and NheI/NotI (MC-hHsp90α).Protein Purification—Proteins were purified from heterologous expression cultures. Hsp90β was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (27Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp90β (and also Hsp90α) were expressed from plasmids (pET23-Hsp90α and pET9-Hsp90β) in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Hsp90 expression was induced at an A600 of 0.7. Expression was allowed to proceed for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA buffer, and lysed using a cell disrupter (Constant Systems, Weehawken, UK). The cleared lysate was applied to a DEAD-Sepharose column (GE Bioscience). Hsp90-containing fractions were loaded on to a ResourceQ column (GE Bioscience). As a final purification step, a gel filtration column (Superdex 200HiLoad; GE Bioscience) was performed in 40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT.All other Hsp90 constructs and both Aha1 proteins were expressed in E. coli as described above and purified using an N-terminal His6 tag for affinity purification on a nickel-loaded chelating Sepharose matrix (GE Bioscience). Protein-containing fractions were further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a ResourceQ column (GE Bioscience) and a gel filtration step as described above.The purified proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry to confirm the size of the proteins. Protein purity was higher than 95% in all cases. Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated extinction coefficients of ϵ280 = 0.70 for hHp90α, ϵ280 = 0.70 for hHsp90β, ϵ280 = 1.71 for hAha1, and ϵ280 = 1.28 for yAha1. Hsp90 proteins were stored in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT at concentrations of 3–5 mg/ml, and Aha1 was stored in the same buffer at 10–20 mg/ml at –80 °C.Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Jasco PU1580 HPLC system equipped with a Jasco FP 1520 fluoresecence detector (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany) using a Superdex 200HR (GE Bioscience) column in 40 mm HEPES/KOH, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT as running buffer. Protein concentrations ranging from 50 nm to 10 μm were applied, and the elution time was monitored by intrinsic protein fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 320 nm.ATPase Measurements—ATP turnover rates were determined by a spectrophotometric assay with an enzymatic ATP regeneration system in 40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP as described elsewhere (6Panaretou B.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Hsp90 concentrations of 1–10 μm were used, and the temperature was set to 37 °C. The addition of 50 μm radicicol was used to specifically inhibit the Hsp90 ATPase activity in order to accurately determine the ATP turnover of Hsp90. For ATPase assays with Aha1, KCl was omitted to improve the affinity between Hsp90 and Aha1, which is very salt-sensitive (20Panaretou B. Siligardi G. Meyer P. Maloney A. Sullivan J.K. Singh S. Millson S.H. Clarke P.A. Naaby-Hansen S. Stein R. Cramer R. Mollapour M. Workman P. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1307-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Heterodimer formation during the ATPase assay was achieved by mixing the two protomers as previously described (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). After 30 min of equilibration at 37 °C, ATP was added. Heterodimer assays and the co-chaperone-induced stimulation of ATP turnover were analyzed as described before (21Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10328-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Determination of the Km value for ATP was performed by varying the ATP concentration while keeping other parameters of the ATPase measurement (buffer conditions, temperature, and Hsp90 concentration) constant. The Km value then was derived from the ATPase activities according to Equation 1, with c being the concentration of ATP in the assay. V=Vmax×c/(c+Km)(Eq. 1) Determination of the activation energies was performed by varying the temperature of the ATPase assay. ATPase activities were plotted as ln(v) against 1/T and analyzed regarding the linear nature of the plot. At temperatures above 55 °C, all three proteins showed loss of activity. The linear part of the plot was analyzed based on Equation 2, resulting in a value for the activation energy EA. ln(v)=Const−EA/R×(1/T)(Eq. 2) Subunit Exchange Kinetics—Subunit exchange in the Hsp90 dimer was monitored by changes in ATPase activity upon the addition of either activating or inactivating Hsp90-subunits. To this end, 20 μl of a solution containing either MC-hHsp90β or lidless hHsp90β were added to an ATPase assay mixture of 120 μl. The change in ATPase activity was monitored at 340 nm at the indicated buffer conditions and temperature. Data were processed by multiplying the absorption traces after the addition of the respective Hsp90 variant by a factor of 1.167 (140/120) to correct the reduced absorption itself and the activity, which was reduced due to the change in concentration of active Hsp90. Data were analyzed according to Equation 3, A340=A0+(mfinal+(mstart−mfinal)×e−k×t)×t(Eq. 3) where mstart and mfinal represent the slope of the ATPase assay prior to and after subunit exchange, respectively, and k is an observed first-order rate constant, which includes the initial dissociation of the subunits and the reassociation to form the active species. Therefore, the interpretation of this value is not straightforward; nevertheless, it can be used to compare the overall dynamics of the system (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As a control, we added 20 μl of buffer and observed a reduced absorbance and a slope corresponding to the dilution factor but no observable reaction leading to further changes in the turnover rate.Single-turnover ATPase Assay—For single-turnover measurements, we used hHsp90β at concentrations of 321 μm. ATP was added to a concentration of 260 μm, with 1.5 mCi of [α-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytics, Braunschweig, Germany). The assay was performed in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C and started by the addition of ATP. The hydrolysis kinetics were measured by taking samples at defined time points. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Samples were subjected to thin layer chromatography, and the radioactivity was analyzed using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (GE Biosciences), as described (25Frey S. Leskovar A. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35612-35620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chase experiments were performed by adding a 100-fold excess of cold ADP over ATP after 5 min of hydrolysis time. Proceeding hydrolysis was analyzed again by taking samples at defined time points, stopping the reaction with 50 mm EDTA and analyzing the amount of hydrolyzed ATP by thin layer chromatography. Any hydrolysis of radioactive ATP after the addition of ADP is considered to be the result of commitment during the ATPase cycle.Kinetic Evaluation of Nucleotide Binding—(Pγ)-MABA-ATP was injected into a solution of hHsp90α or hHsp90β using a SF-61 DX2 double mixing stopped flow instrumentation (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK). The excitation slit was set to 1 nm, if not indicated otherwise. Nucleotide binding reactions were followed by direct excitation of the fluorescent MABA group at 364 nm. The emission was detected using a cut-off filter of 420 nm. Each experiment was performed between three and eight times, and the resulting time traces were averaged with the software from Hi-Tech Scientific for an accurate determination.Different concentrations of Hsp90s were used to obtain multiple scans for the evaluation of both binding parameters, kon and koff. In the case of hHsp90α, the determination of koff was performed independently by preincubating hHsp90 with (Pγ)-MABA-ATP. The fast addition of a large excess of ADP results in the direct observation of koff. This value can be used to restrain the fit for kon and improve the accuracy of the determined values. kon is determined from the slope of the linear line in the plot (ln kobs versus cHsp90). Concentrations are indicated as final concentrations in the instrument cell after dilution with ligand.RESULTSThe ATPase Activity of Both Human Hsp90s Is Low and Salt-dependent—The ATPase activity of hHsp90β has been described to be very low (18McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In order to determine the ATPase properties of both human Hsp90 homologues, recombinantly produced hHsp90α and hHsp90β were purified to homogeneity, and their basic enzymatic features were compared with yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90). We analyzed the ATPase activity at different salt concentrations and observed for both human proteins and yeast Hsp90 an increase in activity with increasing KCl concentrations (Fig. 1A). Apparently, for all three proteins, the rate-limiting step is sensitive to salt concentrations in agreement with the known salt dependence of GHKL-ATPases (30Hu X. Machius M. Yang W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, for both human Hsp90 proteins, the turnover numbers were dramatically lower than those obtained for yeast Hsp90. Hydrolysis rate constants at standard salt concentrations (150 mm KCl) were 1.2 min–1 for yHsp90 and 0.10 and 0.08 min–1 for hHsp90α and hHsp90β, respectively. Both human Hsp90 homologues were sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitors radicicol and geldanamycin (data not shown).The Km values for yHsp90 and the two human Hsp90 proteins were determined to be in the range of 300 μm (Fig. 1B). This is in the range of previously determined Km values for other Hsp90 family members (31Wegele H. Muschler P. Bunck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATP affinity does not appear to be the cause for the slower ATP turnover rate of the human Hsp90s. Next, we analyzed the temperature dependence of the turnover rate in order to estimate the activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction. We determined the turnover rates at 37, 45, 50, and 55 °C and plotted the results in a ln(k) versus 1/T plot (Fig. 1C). This plot was used to estimate the activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction of hHsp90α, hHsp90β, and yHsp90. All Hsp90 members tested exhibit high activation energies of 130 kJ/mol for human Hsp90s and 91 kJ/mol for yeast Hsp90. The results imply that a significantly higher activation energy has to be overcome by human Hsp90s compared with yeast Hsp90, implying that their enzymatic efficiency is significantly lower. Nevertheless, for all three proteins, the unusually high activation energy may explain the slow turnover rates of 1.2 ATP/min (for yHsp90) or 0.10 and 0.08 ATP/min (for the human Hsp90α and -β, respectively).Conformational Changes Prior to Hydrolysis Represent the Rate-limiting Step of Human Hsp90β—Given that human Hsp90s show decreased ATPase activities compared with the yeast protein, we wondered whether the nature of the rate-limiting step was conserved. To determine whether the rate of ATP binding was the rate-limiting step, we measured binding and dissociation kinetics using (Pγ)-MABA-ATP and determined a koff value of 4.1 s–1 and a kon value of 0.12 μm–1 s–1 for human Hsp90β at 25 °C (Fig. 2A and Table 1). For hHsp90α, we observed similar values (koff = 3.13 s–1 and kon = 0.06 μm–1 s–1). These values are similar to those previously determined for other Hsp90 family members (15Richter K. Reinstein J.

A, the kinetics of nucleotide binding to hHsp90β were analyzed at 25 °C in a buffer of 40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2 using (Pγ)-MABA-ATP as a fluorescent nucleotide analogue. Concentrations are indicated as final concentrations in the instrument cell after dilution with ligand.

https://openalex.org/W1981921100,"Refractory Anemia with Ring Sideroblasts (RARS) is an acquired myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by an excess iron accumulation in the mitochondria of erythroblasts. The pathogenesis of RARS and the cause of this unusual pattern of iron deposition remain unknown. We considered that the inherited X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A) might be informative for the acquired disorder, RARS. XLSA/A is caused by partial inactivating mutations of the ABCB7 ATP-binding cassette transporter gene, which functions to enable transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, ABCB7 gene silencing in HeLa cells causes an accumulation of iron in the mitochondria. We have studied the role of ABCB7 in RARS by DNA sequencing, methylation studies, and gene expression studies in primary CD34+ cells and in cultured erythroblasts. The DNA sequence of the ABCB7 gene is normal in patients with RARS. We have investigated ABCB7 gene expression levels in the CD34+ cells of 122 MDS cases, comprising 35 patients with refractory anemia (RA), 33 patients with RARS and 54 patients with RA with excess blasts (RAEB), and in the CD34+ cells of 16 healthy controls. We found that the expression levels of ABCB7 are significantly lower in the RARS group. RARS is thus characterized by lower levels of ABCB7 gene expression in comparison to other MDS subtypes. Moreover, we find a strong relationship between increasing percentage of bone marrow ring sideroblasts and decreasing ABCB7 gene expression levels. Erythroblast cell cultures confirm the low levels of ABCB7 gene expression levels in RARS.

Methodology/Principal Findings Safety, tolerability and effects on disease activity of atorvastatin given alone or in combination with interferon-beta (IFN-β) were assessed in a phase II open-label baseline-to-treatment trial in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Patients with at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion (CEL) at screening by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were eligible for the study. After a baseline period of 3 monthly MRI scans (months −2 to 0), patients followed a 9-month treatment period on 80 mg atorvastatin daily. The number of CEL in treatment months 6 to 9 compared to baseline served as the primary endpoint. Other MRI-based parameters as well as changes in clinical scores and immune responses served as secondary endpoints. Of 80 RRMS patients screened, 41 were included, among them 16 with IFN-β comedication. The high dose of 80 mg atorvastatin was well tolerated in the majority of patients, regardless of IFN-β comedication. Atorvastatin treatment led to a substantial reduction in the number and volume of CEL in two-sided multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and p = 0.008). A trend towards a significant decrease in number and volume of CEL was also detected in patients with IFN-β comedication (p = 0.060 and p = 0.062), in contrast to patients without IFN-β comedication (p = 0.170 and p = 0.140). Immunological investigations showed no suppression in T cell response but a significant increase in IL-10 production. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that high-dose atorvastatin treatment in RRMS is safe and well tolerated. Moreover, MRI analysis indicates a possible beneficial effect of atorvastatin, alone or in combination with IFN-β, on the development of new CEL. Thus, our findings provide a rationale for phase II/III trials, including combination of atorvastatin with already approved immunomodulatory therapy regimens.

https://openalex.org/W1983383222,"While neurosphere- as well as xenograft tumor-initiating cells have been identified in gliomas, the resemblance between glioma cells and neural stem/progenitor cells as well as the prognostic value of stem/progenitor cell marker expression in glioma are poorly clarified.Viable glioma cells were characterized for surface marker expression along the glial genesis hierarchy. Six low-grade and 17 high-grade glioma specimens were flow-cytometrically analyzed for markers characteristics of stem cells (CD133); glial progenitors (PDGFRalpha, A2B5, O4, and CD44); and late oligodendrocyte progenitors (O1). In parallel, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was immunohistochemically analyzed in fixed tissue specimens. Irrespective of the grade and morphological diagnosis of gliomas, glioma cells concomitantly expressed PDGFRalpha, A2B5, O4, CD44 and GFAP. In contrast, O1 was weakly expressed in all low-grade and the majority of high-grade glioma specimens analyzed. Co-expression of neuronal markers was observed in all high-grade, but not low-grade, glioma specimens analyzed. The rare CD133 expressing cells in low-grade glioma specimens typically co-expressed vessel endothelial marker CD31. In contrast, distinct CD133 expression profiles in up to 90% of CD45-negative glioma cells were observed in 12 of the 17 high-grade glioma specimens and the majority of these CD133 expressing cells were CD31 negative. The CD133 expression correlates inversely with length of patient survival. Surprisingly, cytogenetic analysis showed that gliomas contained normal and abnormal cell karyotypes with hitherto indistinguishable phenotype.This study constitutes an important step towards clarification of lineage commitment and differentiation blockage of glioma cells. Our data suggest that glioma cells may resemble expansion of glial lineage progenitor cells with compromised differentiation capacity downstream of A2B5 and O4 expression. The concurrent expression of neuronal markers demonstrates that high-grade glioma cells are endowed with multi-lineage differentiation potential in vivo. Importantly, enhanced CD133 expression marks a poor prognosis in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W1972305321,"Amyloidoses are devastating and currently incurable diseases in which the process of amyloid formation causes fatal cellular and organ damage. The molecular mechanisms underlying amyloidoses are not well known. In this study, we address the structural basis of immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, which results from deposition of light chains produced by clonal plasma cells. We compare light chain amyloidosis protein AL-09 to its wild-type counterpart, the kappaI O18/O8 light chain germline. Crystallographic studies indicate that both proteins form dimers. However, AL-09 has an altered dimer interface that is rotated 90 degrees from the kappaI O18/O8 dimer interface. The three non-conservative mutations in AL-09 are located within the dimer interface, consistent with their role in the decreased stability of this amyloidogenic protein. Moreover, AL-09 forms amyloid fibrils more quickly than kappaI O18/O8 in vitro. These results support the notion that the increased stability of the monomer and delayed fibril formation, together with a properly formed dimer, may be protective against amyloidogenesis. This could open a new direction into rational drug design for amyloidogenic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1970022594,"Trypanosomes are ancient eukaryotic parasites in which the protein-coding genes, organized in large polycistronic clusters on both strands, are transcribed from as yet unidentified promoters. In an effort to reveal transcriptional initiation sites, we examined the Trypanosoma cruzi genome for histone modification patterns shown to be linked to active genes in various organisms. Here, we show that acetylated and methylated histones were found to be enriched at strand switch regions of divergent gene arrays, not at convergent clusters or intra- and intergenic regions within clusters. The modified region showed a bimodular profile with two peaks centered over the 5′-regions of the gene pair flanking the strand switch region. This pattern, which demarcates polycistronic transcription units originating from bidirectional initiation sites, is likely to be common in kinetoplastid parasites as well as in other organisms with polycistronic transcription. In contrast, no acetylation was found at promoters of the highly expressed rRNA and spliced leader genes or satellite DNA or at tested retrotransposonal elements. These results reveal, for the first time, the presence of specific epigenetic marks in T. cruzi with potential implications for transcriptional regulation; they indicate that both histone modifications and bidirectional transcription are evolutionarily conserved.

The trypanosomatids, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania major are human parasitic pathogens with a complex life cycle that comprises passage through different hosts and morphological states, requiring rapid and selective modulation of transcriptomes. Recent genomic sequences have confirmed arrangement of trypanosome genes in large co-directional clusters (1El-Sayed N.M. Myler P.J. Bartholomeu D.C. Nilsson D. Aggarwal G. Tran A.N. Ghedin E.

Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The rarity of canonical transcription factors and regulatory DNA sequences points toward gene expression control through modulations of chromatin structures instead of the traditional modes of transcriptional control. Evidently, epigenetic regulation mediated through chromatin modifications would influence important processes such as antigen variation, virulence, and differentiation in trypanosomes and other protozoan parasites (5Sullivan Jr., W.J. Naguleswaran A. Angel S.O. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). From bacteria to man, chromatin conformation often plays important roles in transcriptional control, DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Access to DNA is modulated by changes in the chromatin structure through methylation of DNA and post-translational modification (such as acetylation and methylation) of histones, specific histone variants, and chromatin-remodeling proteins. Trypanosome histones are unusually divergent in sequence, e.g. an atypical histone H1 lacking the globular domain (6Åslund L. Carlsson L. Henriksson J. Rydåker M. Toro G.C. Galanti N. Pettersson U. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which contributes to the limited compaction of trypanosome chromatin with no further packaging into 30-nm fibers or metaphase chromosomes (7Solari A.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1980; 78: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, altered chromatin condensation is observed at different developmental stages of T. cruzi; a higher compaction occurs in the non-replicative trypomastigote stage compared with the intracellular amastigote stage in mammalian hosts or with the epimastigotes stage in the insect vector. Variation in total mRNA levels is observed during development, with a reduction in trypomastigotes correlating with an increased amount of heterochromatin (8Elias M.C. Marques-Porto R. Freymuller E. Schenkman S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible epigenetic contribution to transcription. Apart from the canonical core histones, trypanosomes also harbor variants. Homologs to the histone H3 variants (H3.3, associated with active transcription, and CenH3, binding to centromeres) have not been found in trypanosomes, which instead harbor a H3 variant found associated with telomeres (9Lowell J.E. Cross G.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5937-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). H2AZ, which have been linked to active transcription or prevention of the spread of heterochromatin in yeast, appears to have a different function in T. brucei, where its homolog does not co-localize to sites of transcription but dimerizes with a novel H2B variant (10Lowell J.E. Kaiser F. Janzen C.J. Cross G.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5721-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Chromatin-remodeling proteins relating to the SWI/SNF2 family have been found to regulate the synthesis of modified thymines in telomeric DNA in T. brucei, contributing to the epigenetic silencing of variant surface glycoproteins involved in antigen variation (11DiPaolo C. Kieft R. Cross M. Sabatini R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Histone H3K79 methylation, mediated by DOT1 methyltransferase, is a modification associated with transcriptional activation and cell cycle control. In T. brucei, two DOT1 homologs were found to be important for mitotic cell cycle control (12Janzen C.J. Hake S.B. Lowell J.E. Cross G.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Histone acetyl-transferase and deacetylases genes are present in the genome of trypanosomes. Four histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been studied in T. brucei, out of which two (DAC1 and DAC3) were shown to be essential for parasite survival and one crucial in cell cycle regulation (DAC4) (13Ingram A.K. Horn D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also a SIR2-related protein showing both ADP-ribosylation and -deacetylation activity, possibly involved in DNA repair, has been identified in T. brucei (14Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Gijon P. Nolan D.P. Tebabi P. Pays E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5851-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Histone H3 and H4 acetylation as well as histone H3K4 trimethylation are modifications associated with transcriptionally active genes and are typically found in the proximity of transcription start sites. The so-called “histone code” tends to be evolutionarily conserved; in particular, acetylation at H3K9/K14 and H4K5/K12 and trimethylation at H3K4 (H3K4me3) are linked to transcription rate (15Rando O.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 1-6Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Of these, histone H4 acetylation and histone H3 trimethylation at Lys-4 have been found in trypanosomes (16Janzen C.J. Fernandez J.P. Deng H. Diaz R. Hake S.B. Cross G.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2306-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17da Cunha J.P. Nakayasu E.S. de Almeida I.C. Schenkman S. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2007; 156: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because transcription initiation mechanisms, as well as the role of histone modifications, are largely unknown in trypanosomes, we were interested in mapping the in vivo location of acetylated histones H3/H4 and trimethylated histone H3K4 in different T. cruzi genomic loci implicated in transcription regulation. Here, we show a striking association of all three modifications to regions separating divergent gene clusters in the T. cruzi parasite, correlating with transcriptional initiation sites. This histone code profile shown here is likely to be the general pattern in kinetoplastid parasites and for polycistronic transcription in other organisms. Also, the acetylation status and nucleosome occupancy at promoters of the highly expressed rRNA and spliced leader (SL) RNA genes, as well as satellite DNA and some retrotransposons, were investigated. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—T. cruzi epimastigotes were grown as described (19Kendall G. Wilderspin A.F. Ashall F. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Approximately 109 parasites were used per ChIP experiment following the protocol of Rada-Iglesias et al. (20Rada-Iglesias A. Wallerman O. Koch C. Ameur A. Enroth S. Clelland G. Wester K. Wilcox S. Dovey O.M. Ellis P.D. Wraight V.L. James K. Andrews R. Langford C. Dhami P. Carter N. Vetrie D. Ponten F. Komorowski J. Dunham I. Wadelius C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3435-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Parasites were washed twice with 1× PBS and resuspended in 25 ml of serum-free medium. Cross-linking was performed by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of dH20 for the ChIP reactions and 500 μl for the total inputs. All ChIP assays were done in three independent replicates. ChIP experiments were performed using α-acetylated histone H3K9/K14 (catalogue no. 06-599) and α-acetylated histone H4K5/K8/K12/K16 (catalogue no. 06-866) antibodies (Upstate) and α-histone H3 trimethylated Lys-4 (ab8580) and α-histone H3 (ab1791) antibodies (AbCam). Additional ChIPs with “no antibody” were used as controls. PCRs were performed using 0.5 μl of the resuspended DNA and corresponding primers (0.3 μm) (supplemental Table S1) in a total volume of 30 μl. PCR reactions were heated for 10 min at 95 °C and run for 15–32 cycles under the following conditions: 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 45 s at 72 °C, and a final step of 7 min at 72 °C. In the long range analysis, PCRs were carried out using a total of 17 different primer pairs spanning contig 7617 (supplemental Table S1). Two independent ChIP experiments were done for each antibody. The intensity of the bands was measured, and the mean value of two experiments was calculated. The ratio of positive to input values was normalized with respect to their mean, and log2 of the resulting values was used to build the graph (Fig. 3A). Antibodies—ChIP assays were performed using antibodies raised against Tetrahymena acetylated histones H3 at Lys-9/Lys-14, acetylated H4 at Lys-5/Lys-8/Lys-12/Lys-16, and trimethylated histone H3 at Lys-4, which were reported previously to recognize specifically the modified histones in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (21Saksouk N. Bhatti M.M. Kieffer S. Smith A.T. Musset K. Garin J. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Hakimi M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10301-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Gissot M. Kelly K.A. Ajioka J.W. Greally J.M. Kim K. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e77Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All lysines are conserved in the T. cruzi histones H3 and H4 (supplemental Fig. S9). The three antibodies recognized only nuclear proteins in immunofluorescence assays of T. cruzi parasites (supplemental Fig. S9A). In Western blot (supplemental Fig. S9B), anti-acH3 antibodies recognized a band with an expected size corresponding to histone H3 (also recognized by antibody against total histone H3) as well as histone H4. Weaker bands of H2A/H2B were also detected. Anti-acetylated H4 antibodies bound preferentially histone H4 but also recognized the other histones. Anti-H3K4me3 antibodies recognized histones H3 and H2A/H2B (data not shown). To further test the specificity of the antibodies, a peptide was designed corresponding to the 23 N-terminal amino acids of T. cruzi histone H4 containing the identified acetylated lysines (Lys-4, Lys-10, Lys-14) (17da Cunha J.P. Nakayasu E.S. de Almeida I.C. Schenkman S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This peptide was recognized by α-acH4 antibodies and competed for H4 binding in Western blot when antibodies were preincubated with the peptide (supplemental Fig. S10). Anti-acH3 antibodies did not recognize the acH4 peptide, and preincubation with the peptide did not affect the recognition pattern of α-acH3 antibodies in Western blots (supplemental Fig. S10). The same H4 peptide, including no acetylation, was not recognized by any of the antibodies (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation experiments to study the targets of the antibodies in native protein extracts of the parasite yielded insufficient amounts of protein to allow analysis by mass spectrometry. Total histone H3 protein was subjected to mass spectrometry, but characterization of N-terminal modifications was impeded because of difficulties in generating peptides of the appropriate size for analysis. Attempts were also made to enrich histone acetylation by treating parasites with the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (0.3 μm for 0, 6, and 24 h) and butyric acid (5 and 10 mm for 0, 6, and 24 h) with no success (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts from T. cruzi epimastigotes were fractionated on NuPAGE 4–12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) at 200 V for 35 min in MES running buffer. MultiMark multicolored standard (Invitrogen) was used as a protein size marker. The gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) at 80 V for 30 min on ice. The membrane was developed using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (see manufacturer's instructions; GE Healthcare). Briefly, after 1 h of incubation in blocking solution, the membrane was washed and incubated for an additional hour with primary antibody. Primary antibody dilutions used in this protocol were as follows: α-acH3 and α-H3, 1:2000; α-acH4 and α-H3K4me3, 1:5000. Secondary antibody incubation was performed using rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (GE Healthcare) at 1:5000, and the result was detected on Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare). Immunostaining—T. cruzi epimastigotes were washed twice in 1× PBS and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. One drop of resuspended parasites was spotted onto each coverslips pretreated with poly-lysine (Sigma) for 30 min, and the cells were then permeabilized with PBS/0.3% Triton X-100. The slides were treated with Image-iT FX signal enhancer (Molecular Probes) for blocking background staining. An additional overnight blocking step was carried out in a filtered solution containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 1× filtered PBS. All antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking solution for 1–2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed in 1× PBS and incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) with a dilution factor of 1:150 for 1 h. Finally the coverslips were rinsed with 1× PBS and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade (Molecular Probes). For controls, parasites were also stained with secondary antibody alone at a dilution of 1:150. Images were acquired using a 510 Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera. A ×63 oil immersion objective was used. Images were collected using LSM 5 Image Browser software and subsequently were prepared using Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)—ChIPs were performed as described above, using α-acH3 and α-H3K4me3 antibodies. Q-PCR was run using the SYBR Green detection system in ABI PRISM 7900HT, typically using 0.5 μl of ChIP DNA/reaction. In parallel with the ChIP DNA, a serial dilution of the corresponding input DNA (1:2, 1:10, 1:50, 1:250) was also analyzed by Q-PCR. Ct values (where Ct is cycle threshold) were obtained in each case, and a standard curve for each primer pair was calculated based on the values of the input serial dilution. Based on those curves we inferred the amount of DNA (expressed in arbitrary units) in the ChIP DNA for each analyzed region. All genomic regions and primers employed are listed in supplemental Table S1. All Q-PCR reactions were performed in duplicate, unless the S.D. between signals was higher than 1, in which case a third replicate was obtained. Cloning and Sequencing of ChIP Material—About 100 ng of the DNA precipitated with anti-acH3 antibody was amplified using the GenomePlex® Complete Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) Kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting DNA was purified using GFX™ PCR DNA and gel band purification columns (GE Healthcare) ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Amplified inserts or plasmid DNA from recombinant clones were sequenced by BigDye® Terminator version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and run on an ABI PRISM® 3700 DNA analyzer. Sequence analysis was done using Sequencher™ software. Acetylated Histones H3/H4 and H3K4me3 Associate with Strand Switch Regions Separating Divergent Gene Clusters— The distribution of acetylated histones H3/H4 and H3K4me3 in 24 head-to-head (HH) and 24 tail-to-tail (TT) SSRs was analyzed in the T. cruzi CL Brener strain at the epimastigote stage using ChIP. Invariably, all analyzed HH SSRs were enriched with the modified histones (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S5), whereas all TT SSRs except one (see below) showed low levels of histone modification. In amplified ChIP material, H3K4me3 gave the strongest signal, but the α-acH3 antibodies showed a more pronounced differential distribution compared with the α-acH4 antibodies (Fig. 1, A and C). The numerical data of the different enrichments of modified histones in HH versus TT SSRs, corrected for nucleosome occupancy (see below), are shown in supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 1C and as a box plot in supplemental Fig. S6. The estimated average values showed the highest enrichment level for H3K4me3 (10-fold), whereas acetylated H3 and H4 yielded an approximate 7- and 6-fold enrichment levels, respectively. Double bands were sometimes obtained as a result of sequence length polymorphism among homologous chromosomes because of the hybrid nature of CL Brener strain. Only one TT (contig 7271) showed some enrichment in acetylated and methylated histones (supplemental Fig. S5), which could be due to the presence of two tRNA genes carrying their own promoters. However, TTs 6288 and 7869 also contain tRNAs and yet showed neither acetylation nor methylation (supplemental Fig. S5 and Fig. 1A, respectively). The acetylation status of the analyzed regions did not differ among parasite strains, as similar results were obtained from α-acH3 ChIP experiments in other T. cruzi strains (data not shown). We quantified the enrichment level of histone H3 acetylation by analyzing a subset of HH and TT SSRs using ChIP/Q-PCR (Fig. 1B). The enrichment varied among HH SSRs, but on average the values at these HH SSRs increased by a factor of 18 compared with those at the TT regions. To confirm that the ChIP results were not the result of absence or inaccessibility of nucleosomes in TT regions, an α-H3 antibody recognizing modified as well as unmodified histone H3 was used to provide a measure of total nucleosome occupancy. Both the HH and TT regions were enriched for total histone H3, confirming the presence of nucleosomes (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S5), although the enrichment of total histone H3 appeared to be higher at the HH regions. To analyze whether the difference in modified histones between HH and TT was simply due to variation in the amount of nucleosomes, the enrichment values for modified histones were corrected for nucleosome occupancy by dividing these with the enrichment levels of total histone H3. The resulting data showed that the modified histones indeed were overrepresented at the HH or divergent SSRs, as mentioned above (supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 1C). These experiments also verified that the acH3 and acH4 antibodies recognized the subpopulation of nucleosomes with acetylated histones. The specificity of the antibodies used was tested as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown on supplemental Figs. S9 and S10. To identify genomic regions enriched in acetylated histones without any preselection, the immunoprecipitated α-acH3 DNA was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Of in total nine sequences, seven were enriched and represented regions located in proximity to a HH SSR (50 bp to 6 kb). H3 acetylation at these sequences was confirmed by PCR analysis of ChIP material using specific primers (supplemental Fig. S11). Several of the cloned sequences were derived from parasite surface antigen genes, a reflection of the large number of SSRs located in subtelomeric regions, which harbor the main arsenal of such genes.

To examine whether intragenic acetylation had influenced our results, given that the HH and TT SSRs comprise the 5′- and 3′-ends of genes, respectively, we determined the acetylation pattern of a set of 5′- and 3′-UTRs positioned within the gene arrays at an average 20-kb distance from a HH SSR at different locations in the T. cruzi genome. No enrichment of acetylated histones H3 and H4 was observed at either the 5′- or 3′-UTRs (Fig. 2). We concluded that distribution of acetylation does not differ intragenically in T. cruzi and that acetylated histones were preferentially localized at HH SSRs. These results concur with the notion of the modification pattern expected for polycistronic transcription units. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional sites of transcriptional initiation do occur at locations other than HH SSRs. In T. brucei, RNA pol II has been co-localized in vivo with transcription factor TRF4 to the 3′-ends of a few genes associated with increased local transcription (25Ruan J.P. Arhin G.K. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9610-9618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whether these sites are cryptic promoters is not known. Acetylated Histones H3/H4 and H3K4me3 Are Present at Sites Initiating Bidirectional Transcription of Polycistronic Units—To determine the extent of acetylation and trimethylation surrounding a HH SSR and profile a larger region of the T. cruzi genome, we performed a long range ChIP analysis covering a genomic contig of 250 kb comprising one HH and one TT SSR (Fig. 3A). The genomic region was probed using the same set of antibodies and 17 primer pairs located both in intergenic regions and within predicted open reading frames. Again, the HH SSR was highly enriched in acetylated H3/H4 histones and H3K4me3, although loading of nucleosomes was equal along the whole region (Fig. 3A). Conservative estimates showed the acetylation to extend about 6 kb around the HH SSR encompassing the juxtaposed genes, supposedly embracing shared or separate initiation sites for bidirectional transcription on both strands. Two dips in the acetylation profile appearing at primer pairs 12 and 14 (Fig. 3A) are due to regions that are poorly amplified and not to a lower occupancy of nucleosomes. The trimethylated histone H3 profile showed some enrichment in the region preceding and including the TT region (Fig. 3A); however, the HH SSR of this contig is still about 14 times more enriched in H3K4me3 (supplemental Table S2). Two HH SSRs were further analyzed at higher resolution using ChIP/Q-PCR to amplify ∼150-bp-long fragments covering the HH region as well as parts of the flanking regions (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S7). We observed two peaks of hyperacetylation as well as trimethylation downstream of each of the two ATGs separated by an unmodified region localized at the HH SSRs. Alternatively, the dip in the profiles could also imply a region depleted of nucleosomes, as described previously for yeast pol II promoters (26Yuan G.C. Liu Y.J. Dion M.F. Slack M.D. Wu L.F.

Similarly, T. cruzi HH SSRs are rich in poly(dA-dT) stretches as seen for yeast promoters. To verify that transcription initiates within a HH SSR of T. cruzi, nuclear run-on analysis was performed using strand-specific oligomers spanning the region (supplemental Fig. S8). Transcription of both the sense and antisense strands appeared to initiate within the unmodified part of HH SSR 7739. Transcription from the SSR was thus bidirectional, although the signal for sense strand transcripts was much weaker, as seen from the dot blots on the right segment of the SSR (Fig. S8A). Such difference in strength of the transcription signals between strands was also reported for the divergent SSRs on chromosome 1 in L. major (3Martinez-Calvillo S. Yan S. Nguyen D. Fox M. Stuart K.

https://openalex.org/W2014522878,"Serum uric acid (UA) levels have recently been shown to be genetically influenced by common polymorphisms in the GLUT9 gene in two genome-wide association analyses of Italian and British populations. Elevated serum UA levels are often found in conjunction with the metabolic syndrome. Hyperuricemia is the major risk factor for gout and has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the association of polymorphisms in GLUT9 with gout and coronary artery disease (CAD) or myocardial infarction (MI). To test our hypotheses, we performed two large case-control association analyses of individuals from the German MI Family Study.First, 665 patients with gout and 665 healthy controls, which were carefully matched for age and gender, were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the GLUT9 gene. All four SNPs demonstrated highly significant association with gout. SNP rs6855911, located within intron 7 of GLUT9, showed the strongest signal with a protective effect of the minor allele with an allelic odds ratio of 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.52-0.75; p = 3.2*10(-7)). Importantly, this finding was not influenced by adjustment for components of the metabolic syndrome or intake of diuretics. Secondly, 1,473 cases with severe CAD or MI and 1,241 healthy controls were tested for the same four GLUT9 SNPs. The analyses revealed, however, no significant association with CAD or with MI. Additional screening of genome-wide association data sets showed no signal for CAD or MI within the GLUT9 gene region.Thus, our results provide compelling evidence that common genetic variations within the GLUT9 gene strongly influence the risk for gout but are unlikely to have a major effect on CAD or MI in a German population."
https://openalex.org/W2020148868,"Cooperation plays a key role in the evolution of complex systems. However, the level of cooperation extensively varies with the topology of agent networks in the widely used models of repeated games. Here we show that cooperation remains rather stable by applying the reinforcement learning strategy adoption rule, Q-learning on a variety of random, regular, small-word, scale-free and modular network models in repeated, multi-agent Prisoner's Dilemma and Hawk-Dove games. Furthermore, we found that using the above model systems other long-term learning strategy adoption rules also promote cooperation, while introducing a low level of noise (as a model of innovation) to the strategy adoption rules makes the level of cooperation less dependent on the actual network topology. Our results demonstrate that long-term learning and random elements in the strategy adoption rules, when acting together, extend the range of network topologies enabling the development of cooperation at a wider range of costs and temptations. These results suggest that a balanced duo of learning and innovation may help to preserve cooperation during the re-organization of real-world networks, and may play a prominent role in the evolution of self-organizing, complex systems."
https://openalex.org/W2126253563,"Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), including heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, are synthesized on the so-called common GAG-protein linkage region (GlcUAbeta1-3Galbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Xylbeta1-O-Ser) of core proteins, which is formed by the stepwise addition of monosaccharide residues by the respective specific glycosyltransferases. Glucuronyltransferase-I (GlcAT-I) is the key enzyme that completes the synthesis of this linkage region, which is a prerequisite for the conversion of core proteins to functional proteoglycans bearing GAGs. The Xyl and Gal residues in the linkage region can be modified by phosphorylation and sulfation, respectively, although the biological significance of these modifications remains to be clarified. Here we present evidence that these modifications can significantly influence the catalytic activity of GlcAT-I. Enzyme assays showed that the synthetic substrates, Gal-Gal-Xyl(2-O-phosphate)-O-Ser and Gal-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl(2-O-phosphate)-O-Ser, served as better substrates than the unmodified compound, whereas Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Gal-Xyl(2-O-phosphate)-O-Ser exhibited no acceptor activity. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of GlcAT-I with UDP and Gal-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl(2-O-phosphate)-O-Ser bound revealed that the Xyl(2-O-phosphate)-O-Ser is disordered and the 6-O-sulfate forms interactions with Gln(318) from the second GlcAT-I monomer in the dimeric enzyme. The results indicate the possible involvement of these modifications in the processing and maturation of the growing linkage region oligosaccharide required for the assembly of GAG chains."
https://openalex.org/W2084938734,"Background Tube expansion defects like stenoses and atresias cause devastating human diseases. Luminal expansion during organogenesis begins to be elucidated in several systems but we still lack a mechanistic view of the process in many organs. The Drosophila tracheal respiratory system provides an amenable model to study tube size regulation. In the trachea, COPII anterograde transport of luminal proteins is required for extracellular matrix assembly and the concurrent tube expansion. Principal Findings We identified and analyzed Drosophila COPI retrograde transport mutants with narrow tracheal tubes. γCOP mutants fail to efficiently secrete luminal components and assemble the luminal chitinous matrix during tracheal tube expansion. Likewise, tube extension is defective in salivary glands, where it also coincides with a failure in the luminal deposition and assembly of a distinct, transient intraluminal matrix. Drosophila γCOP colocalizes with cis-Golgi markers and in γCOP mutant embryos the ER and Golgi structures are severely disrupted. Analysis of γCOP and Sar1 double mutants suggests that bidirectional ER-Golgi traffic maintains the ER and Golgi compartments and is required for secretion and assembly of luminal matrixes during tube expansion. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate the function of COPI components in organ morphogenesis and highlight the common role of apical secretion and assembly of transient organotypic matrices in tube expansion. Intraluminal matrices have been detected in the notochord of ascidians and zebrafish COPI mutants show defects in notochord expansion. Thus, the programmed deposition and growth of distinct luminal molds may provide distending forces during tube expansion in diverse organs."
https://openalex.org/W2019303202,"Protein membrane transduction domains that are able to cross the plasma membrane are present in several transcription factors, such as the homeodomain proteins and the viral proteins such as Tat of HIV-1. Their discovery resulted in both new concepts on the cell communication during development, and the conception of cell penetrating peptide vectors for internalisation of active molecules into cells. A promising cell penetrating peptide is Penetratin, which crosses the cell membranes by a receptor and metabolic energy-independent mechanism. Recent works have claimed that Penetratin and similar peptides are internalized by endocytosis, but other endocytosis-independent mechanisms have been proposed. Endosomes or plasma membranes crossing mechanisms are not well understood. Previously, we have shown that basic peptides induce membrane invaginations suggesting a new mechanism for uptake, ""physical endocytosis"".Herein, we investigate the role of membrane lipid phases on Penetratin induced membrane deformations (liquid ordered such as in ""raft"" microdomains versus disordered fluid ""non-raft"" domains) in membrane models. Experimental data show that zwitterionic lipid headgroups take part in the interaction with Penetratin suggesting that the external leaflet lipids of cells plasma membrane are competent for peptide interaction in the absence of net negative charges. NMR and X-ray diffraction data show that the membrane perturbations (tubulation and vesiculation) are associated with an increase in membrane negative curvature. These effects on curvature were observed in the liquid disordered but not in the liquid ordered (raft-like) membrane domains.The better understanding of the internalisation mechanisms of protein transduction domains will help both the understanding of the mechanisms of cell communication and the development of potential therapeutic molecular vectors. Here we showed that the membrane targets for these molecules are preferentially the fluid membrane domains and that the mechanism involves the induction of membrane negative curvature. Consequences on cellular uptake are discussed."

This was a phase I randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the PfCP-2.9 formulated with a novel adjuvant Montanide ISA720. Fifty-two subjects were randomly assigned to 4 dose groups of 10 participants, each receiving the test vaccine of 20, 50, 100, or 200 µg respectively, and 1 placebo group of 12 participants receiving the adjuvant only. Methods and Findings The vaccine formulation was shown to be safe and well-tolerated, and none of the participants withdrew. The total incidence of local adverse events (AEs) was 75%, distributed among 58% of the placebo group and 80% of those vaccinated. Among the vaccinated, 65% had events that were mild and 15% experienced moderate AEs. Almost all systemic adverse reactions observed in this study were graded as mild and required no therapy. The participants receiving the test vaccine developed detectable antibody responses which were boosted by the repeated vaccinations. Sixty percent of the vaccinated participants had high ELISA titers (>1∶10,000) of antigen-specific antibodies which could also recognize native parasite proteins in an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Conclusion This study is the first clinical trial for this candidate and builds on previous investigations supporting PfCP-2.9/ISA720 as a promising blood-stage malaria vaccine. Results demonstrate safety, tolerability (particularly at the lower doses tested) and immunogenicity of the formulation. Further clinical development is ongoing to explore optimizing the dose and schedule of the formulation to decrease reactogenicity without compromising immunogenicity.

https://openalex.org/W2081365810,"Small molecules have played an important role in delineating molecular pathways involved in embryonic development and disease pathology. The need for novel small molecule modulators of biological processes has driven a number of targeted screens on large diverse libraries. However, due to the specific focus of such screens, the majority of the bioactive potential of these libraries remains unharnessed. In order to identify a higher proportion of compounds with interesting biological activities, we screened a diverse synthetic library for compounds that perturb the development of any of the multiple organs in zebrafish embryos. We identified small molecules that affect the development of a variety of structures such as heart, vasculature, brain, and body-axis. We utilized the previously known role of retinoic acid in anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning to identify the target of DTAB, a compound that caused A-P axis shortening in the zebrafish embryo. We show that DTAB is a retinoid with selective activity towards retinoic acid receptors gamma and beta. Thus, conducting zebrafish developmental screens using small molecules will not only enable the identification of compounds with diverse biological activities in a large chemical library but may also facilitate the identification of the target pathways of these biologically active molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2080322528,"The cell lineage tree of a multicellular organism represents its history of cell divisions from the very first cell, the zygote. A new method for high-resolution reconstruction of parts of such cell lineage trees was recently developed based on phylogenetic analysis of somatic mutations accumulated during normal development of an organism. In this study we apply this method in mice to reconstruct the lineage trees of distinct cell types. We address for the first time basic questions in developmental biology of higher organisms, namely what is the correlation between the lineage relation among cells and their (1) function, (2) physical proximity and (3) anatomical proximity. We analyzed B-cells, kidney-, mesenchymal- and hematopoietic-stem cells, as well as satellite cells, which are adult skeletal muscle stem cells isolated from their niche on the muscle fibers (myofibers) from various skeletal muscles. Our results demonstrate that all analyzed cell types are intermingled in the lineage tree, indicating that none of these cell types are single exclusive clones. We also show a significant correlation between the physical proximity of satellite cells within muscles and their lineage. Furthermore, we show that satellite cells obtained from a single myofiber are significantly clustered in the lineage tree, reflecting their common developmental origin. Lineage analysis based on somatic mutations enables performing high resolution reconstruction of lineage trees in mice and humans, which can provide fundamental insights to many aspects of their development and tissue maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2083019939,"Background Much remains to be known about the mechanisms by which O2-dependent host defenses mediate broad antimicrobial activity. Methodology/Principal Findings We show herein that reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generated by inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) account for the anti-Burkholderia mallei activity of IFNγ-primed macrophages. Inducible NOS-mediated intracellular killing may represent direct bactericidal activity, because B. mallei showed an exquisite sensitivity to NO generated chemically. Exposure of B. mallei to sublethal concentrations of NO upregulated transcription of [Fe-S] cluster repair genes, while damaging the enzymatic activity of the [Fe-S] protein aconitase. To test whether [Fe-S] clusters are critical targets for RNS-dependent killing of B. mallei, a mutation was constructed in the NO-induced, [Fe-S] cluster repair regulator iscR. Not only was the iscR mutant hypersusceptible to iNOS-mediated killing, but its aconitase pool was readily oxidized by NO donors as compared to wild-type controls. Although killed by authentic H2O2, which also oxidizes [Fe-S] clusters, B. mallei appear to be resilient to NADPH oxidase-mediated cytotoxicity. The poor respiratory burst elicited by this bacterium likely explains why the NADPH oxidase is nonessential to the killing of B. mallei while it is still confined within phagosomes. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, these findings have revealed a disparate role for NADPH oxidase and iNOS in the innate macrophage response against the strict aerobe B. mallei. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance in which disruption of [Fe-S] clusters is demonstrated as cause of the bactericidal activity of NO congeners."
https://openalex.org/W2111453871,"Numerous patient and healthcare system-related delays contribute to the overall delay experienced by patients from onset of TB symptoms to diagnosis and treatment. Such delays are critical as infected individuals remain untreated in the community, providing more opportunities for transmission of the disease and adversely affecting the epidemic.We present an analysis of the factors that contribute to the overall delay in TB diagnosis and treatment, in a resource-poor setting. Impact on the distribution of diagnostic delay times was assessed for various factors, the sensitivity of the diagnostic method being found to be the most significant. A linear relationship was found between the sensitivity of the test and the predicted mean delay time, with an increase in test sensitivity resulting in a reduced mean delay time and a reduction in the drop-out rate.The results show that in a developing country a number of delay factors, particularly the low sensitivity of the initial sputum smear microscopy test, potentially increase total diagnostic delay times experienced by TB patients significantly. The results reinforce the urgent need for novel diagnostic methods, both for smear positive and negative TB, that are highly sensitive, accessible and point of care, in order to reduce mean delay times."
https://openalex.org/W2093372420,"A special class of self-assembling peptides has been found to be capable of stabilizing the hydrophobic anticancer agent ellipticine in aqueous solution. Here we study the effect of peptide sequence on the complex formation and its anticancer activity in vitro. Three peptides, EAK16-II, EAK16-IV and EFK16-II, were selected to have either a different charge distribution (EAK16-II vs. EAK16-IV) or a varying hydrophobicity (EAK16-II vs. EFK16-II). Results on their complexation with ellipticine revealed that EAK16-II and EAK16-IV were able to stabilize protonated ellipticine or ellipticine microcrystals depending on the peptide concentration; EFK16-II could stabilize neutral ellipticine molecules and ellipticine microcrystals. These different molecular states of ellipticine were expected to affect ellipticine delivery. The anticancer activity of these complexes was tested against two cancer cell lines: A549 and MCF-7, and related to the cell viability. The viability results showed that the complexes with protonated ellipticine were effective in eradicating both cancer cells (viability <0.05), but their dilutions in water were not stable, leading to a fast decrease in their toxicity. In contrast, the complexes formulated with EFK16-II were relatively stable upon dilution, but their original toxicity was relatively low compared to that with protonated ellipticine. Overall, the charge distribution of the peptides seemed not to affect the complex formation and its therapeutic efficacy in vitro; however, the increase in hydrophobicity of the peptides significantly altered the state of stabilized ellipticine and increased the stability of the complexes. This work provides essential information for peptide sequence design in the development of self-assembling peptide-based delivery of hydrophobic anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2039366890,"Background Synthetic lethal genetic interaction analysis has been successfully applied to predicting the functions of genes and their pathway identities. In the context of synthetic lethal interaction data alone, the global similarity of synthetic lethal interaction patterns between two genes is used to predict gene function. With physical interaction data, such as protein-protein interactions, the enrichment of physical interactions within subsets of genes and the enrichment of synthetic lethal interactions between those subsets of genes are used as an indication of compensatory pathways. Result In this paper, we propose a method of mapping genetically compensatory pathways from synthetic lethal interactions. Our method is designed to discover pairs of gene-sets in which synthetic lethal interactions are depleted among the genes in an individual set and where such gene-set pairs are connected by many synthetic lethal interactions. By its nature, our method could select compensatory pathway pairs that buffer the deleterious effect of the failure of either one, without the need of physical interaction data. By focusing on compensatory pathway pairs where genes in each individual pathway have a highly homogenous cellular function, we show that many cellular functions have genetically compensatory properties. Conclusion We conclude that synthetic lethal interaction data are a powerful source to map genetically compensatory pathways, especially in systems lacking physical interaction information, and that the cellular function network contains abundant compensatory properties."

IgE does not activate complement nor cross the placenta but can sensitize effector cells (principally mast cells and basophils) and typically mediates anaphylactic reactions (6Murphy K.M. Travers P.

Immunol. 1976; 51: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), which are much more numerous than mast cells in birds (in contrast to mammals in which the reverse is true) (15Chand N. Eyre P. Avian Dis. 1978; 22: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These phenomena constitute indirect evidence for the presence of IgY receptors on both chicken monocytes/macrophages and basophils.The ν heavy chain of IgY consists of four constant Ig domains and one variable Ig domain (3Parvari R. Avivi A. Lentner F. Ziv E. Tel-Or S. Burstein Y. Schechter I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), as in mammalian IgE. It is clear from sequence comparisons that after the divergence of the synapsids 310 million years ago (16Hedges S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 17Reisz R.R. Muller J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 237-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but before the divergence of the non-eutherian mammals 166 million years ago (18Bininda-Emonds O.R. Cardillo M. Jones K.E. MacPhee R.D. Beck R.M. Grenyer R. Price S.A. Vos R.A. Gittleman J.L. Purvis A. Nature. 2007; 446: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar), duplication of the ν-gene occurred; this was followed by differentiation into the two Ig classes unique to mammals, IgG and IgE, as indicated by their presence in monotremes (19Vernersson M. Aveskogh M. Hellman L. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2004; 28: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Vernersson M. Aveskogh M. Munday B. Hellman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In IgG, the second domain of the heavy chain constant region condensed to form the hinge polypeptide (3Parvari R. Avivi A. Lentner F. Ziv E. Tel-Or S. Burstein Y. Schechter I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas in IgE, the domain was retained as Cϵ2 so that, like IgY, the Fc fragment consists of three constant Ig domain pairs. The two inter-heavy-chain disulfide bridges in the Cϵ2 domain are present also in Cν2 at the same locations and in the hinge of IgG (Fig. 1).Human mast cells and basophils express the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI), which has an affinity for IgE that is uniquely high: Ka ∼ 1010m–1 (7Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Beavil A.J. Beavil R.L. McCloskey N. Coker H.A. Fear D. Smurthwaite L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 579-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We have shown, through our studies with IgE, IgE-Fc, and a subfragment of IgE-Fc consisting of only the Cϵ3 and Cϵ4 domains termed Fcϵ3–4 (21Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), that the high affinity is due to the slow dissociation rate from FcϵRI (22Cook J.P. Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Owens R.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15568-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that the Cϵ2 domains are in part responsible (24McDonnell J.M. Calvert R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Cowburn D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). With a half-life on tissue mast cells of 2–3 weeks (25Geha R.S. Helm B. Gould H. Nature. 1985; 315: 577-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), IgE can effectively and persistently sensitize these cells for rapid degranulation upon encounter with antigen (allergen). The rapidity of degranulation is responsible for the life-threatening response of anaphylaxis, making an understanding of the mechanism by which the Cϵ2 domains alter the dissociation rate of IgE from its receptor a medically important issue.Cν2-like domain pairs have persisted since their first appearance in a common ancestor that unites all terrestrial vertebrates. To assess their effect on the antibody-Fc receptor interaction, we have expressed two avian IgY-Fc fragments that differ only by the presence (Fcν2–4) or absence (Fcν3–4) of the Cν2 domain pair and measured their binding to the chicken monocyte cell line, MQ-NCSU, as well as that of whole IgY. This is the first report of the cell binding properties of a non-mammalian antibody and also addresses the question of whether the “extra” Cν2 domain pair in IgY necessarily leads to a high affinity interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of Fcν2–4 and Fcν3–4—There is no intron between the CH1 and CH2 exons in chicken (26Zhao Y. Rabbani H. Shimizu A. Hammarstrom L. Immunology. 2000; 101: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, the N terminus of chicken Cν2, Val-231 by the numbering system of Suzuki and Lee (27Suzuki N. Lee Y.C. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was identified by a Clustal W alignment of the sequences of the heavy chain constant region of human IgE (28Kenten J.H. Molgaard H.V. Houghton M. Derbyshire R.B. Viney J. Bell L.O. Gould H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and of duck IgY (29Magor K.E. Warr G.W. Middleton D. Wilson M.R. Higgins D.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2627-2633PubMed Google Scholar) with that of chicken IgY taken from Parvari et al. (3Parvari R. Avivi A. Lentner F. Ziv E. Tel-Or S. Burstein Y. Schechter I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The second residue of Cϵ2 is a cysteine that in IgE forms an intra-chain disulfide bond with Cϵ1; it was therefore mutated to an alanine in Fcϵ2–4 and has similarly been mutated in Fcν2–4. The N-terminal 4 amino acids of IgY-Fc were Asp-Ile (from an EcoRV site) Val-Ala.Fcϵ3–4 included the residues Asp-Ile from an EcoRV restriction site and 2 amino acids from Cϵ2, one of which, a cysteine, was thought to be required to form a functionally important inter-chain disulfide bond (21Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For this reason, a similar Fcν3–4 with an N terminus including Cys-340 was cloned and expressed, but the protein formed intra-chain disulfide bonds with the extra Cys-347 in chicken IgY (Fig. 1). A C347S mutant led to expression of a functional protein, Fcν3–4, which has been used for the study reported here.The polymerase chain reaction was used to engineer EcoRV and PmeI sites onto the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, of both Fcν2–4 and Fcν3–4 cDNA from a chicken splenocyte library (kindly donated by Dr. John Young, Institute of Animal Health, Compton UK). Using a holding vector, a PmeI site was introduced after the stop codon of IgE-Fc so that using EcoRV and PmeI, IgY-Fc could be exchanged for IgE-Fc and then inserted into the pRY vector as a HindIII-HindIII cassette (30Young R.J.

Vectors were transfected into NS0 mouse myeloma cells for production of stable clones expressing Fcν2–4 or Fcν3–4.Purification and Characterization of IgY-Fc Fragment—NS0 mouse myeloma cell supernatants were purified by elution from an anti-IgY-agarose affinity column (Gallus Immunotech, DAIgY-AGA) with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% sodium azide. Protein concentrations were measured in a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian). The molar extinction coefficients for IgY, Fcν2–4, and Fcν3–4 were calculated using ProtParam software (31Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar) and were 209,125, 90,965, and 62,505 mol–1cm–1, respectively. Proteins were analyzed on denaturing SDS gels containing 12% acrylamide and the buffer system of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Western blots used a semidry transfer method (33Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar), and anti-IgY horseradish peroxidase (Promega, G135A) was used for detection.Cell Lines—The MQ-NCSU cell line was provided by Dr. M. A. Qureshi, National Program Leader, Animal Genetics, United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service, Washington, D.C. (34Qureshi M.A. Miller L. Lillehoj H.S. Ficken M.D. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1990; 26: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in modified LM-Hahn medium omitting fetal bovine serum and chick serum, and thereby exogenous IgY, but including 8% ultra-low IgG fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, catalog number 16250-078).Flow Cytometry (FACS)—FACS was used to detect immunostained cells following their incubation with specific antibodies and/or antibody conjugates. In all experiments, cells were washed (by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min) and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, catalog number A7030) before staining for 1 h at 4 °C with chicken IgY-(Fab)2 (Rockland, catalog number 003-0104), (Fab)2 + whole IgY, IgY, or buffer before incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma, catalog number C-7295), which was found to be an anti-Cν2, 5A.

Cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA both before and after all antibody incubation steps and fixed in PBS + 4% formaldehyde (Sigma, catalog number F1635) before analysis in a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences).Radioiodination of Antibodies and Antibody Fragments—Affinity-purified IgY (Stratech, catalog number 003-000-003) and IgY-Fc were radiolabeled with 125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number NEZ033A001MC) using the chloramine-T method (35McConahey P.J. Dixon F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Desalting spin columns (Pierce, catalog number 89849) were used to remove unincorporated 125I and exchange the radiolabeled IgY or IgY-Fc into PBS, 0.05% sodium azide following the manufacturer's protocol. The specific activity in cpm/μg of each radioligand was determined by estimation of the protein concentration (by UV spectrophotometry) and cpm of radioactivity, using a Wizard 1480 γ counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Cell Binding Assays—MQ-NCSU cells were washed in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.4, and incubated at 23 °C for 10 min before resuspension at 107 cells/ml. In experiments to determine the association rate constant, duplicate samples of 106 cells were incubated with 10 nm125I-labeled IgY, Fcν2–4, or Fcν3–4 at 23 °C. At regular intervals, cells were centrifuged through 200 μl of phthalate oil (36Segal D.M. Hurwitz E. J. Immunol. 1977; 118: 1338-1347PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity of the cell pellet was determined using a Wizard 1480 gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The initial rate of association was determined from a linear fit of cpm versus time. Standard errors were generated by the fitting procedure but, due to uncertainty in number of the receptors per cell (see “Discussion”), larger errors have been added to the final values.Dissociation experiments were performed using the method of Kulczycki and Metzger (37Kulczycki Jr., A. Metzger H. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1676-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) but with all steps carried out at room temperature; cells were first incubated with 10 nm125I-labeled IgY, Fcν2–4, or Fcν3–4 for 1 h and then resuspended in an excess of unlabeled IgY, and their radioactivity was assayed as above. Nonspecific binding was measured by incubating cells with an excess (350 nm) of unlabeled IgY for 1 h at room temperature before the addition of 10 nm labeled IgY, and the γ counts obtained were subtracted from the total bound counts. The mean number of receptor sites per MQ-NCSU cell was determined by titrating to saturation with 125I-labeled IgY or Fcν2–4 of known specific activity. Dissociation rate constants were determined both by non-linear regression analysis from a plot of cpm versus time (according to Equation 20, p88, in Goodrich and Kugel (38Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. Binding and Kinetics for Molecular Biologists. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 88Google Scholar)) and from linear regression analysis of a plot of ln(cpm) versus time.RESULTSThe much higher affinity of IgE for its receptor on mast cells when compared with IgG for any of its receptors and the role of the extra Cϵ2 domain pair in IgE prompted this study of chicken IgY, the closest extant immunoglobulin to the ancestor that evolved into all three antibodies.In a preliminary FACS experiment, it was established that chicken serum IgY binds to MQ-NCSU cells in an Fc-dependent manner; IgY Fabs at 400× molar excess over whole IgY were unable to bind to cells or to inhibit IgY binding (Fig. 2). The binding constants determined in the studies described below are thus for IgY and IgY-Fc binding to an IgY-Fc receptor on a chicken monocyte cell line.FIGURE 2IgY binding to chicken monocytes is dependent on the Fc region. Prior to detection with mouse anti-Cν2 (followed by anti-mouse IgS-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Igs-FITC)), cells (shaded histograms) were incubated in PBS-BSA containing 20 μm IgY-Fab alone (A), 50 nm IgY alone (B), or 50 nm IgY+20 μm IgY-Fab (C). Control cells (open histograms) were incubated with PBS-BSA alone before detection. Values shown are ratios of mean fluorescence intensity of each sample to that of control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The action of papain on IgY does not give rise to an Fcν2–4 fragment since the Cν2 domain is digested away (27Suzuki N. Lee Y.C. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hence, to assess the role of Cν2, Fcν2–4 and Fcν3–4 were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins. Purified IgY (Fig. 3, lane 1), recombinant Fcν2–4 (lane 2), and Fcν3–4 (lane 3), both unreduced (Fig. 3, A and C) and reduced (Fig. 3, B and D), were electrophoresed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 3, A and B) or transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with anti-IgY horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Fig. 3, C and D). Reduced heavy chains gave rise to a single band (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–3), suggesting that the small amount of heterogeneous-sized material in unreduced samples was due to the formation of non-native disulfide bonds on exposure to 100 °C in SDS buffer (39Ikeyama S. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and not to degradation or heterogeneity of glycosylation. Western blots of the same samples (Fig. 3, C and D) showed that the polypeptides are indeed IgY of approximately the expected molecular mass with only a minor band of Fcν3–4 monomer (Fig. 3C, lane 3). All were glycosylated as shown by periodic acid Schiff staining,5 and all had essentially no free sulfydryls per mole of IgY or its fragments, as determined by reduction and carboxymethylation (40Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar).5FIGURE 3Characterization of IgY and IgY-Fc fragments. Whole IgY from chicken serum and recombinant IgY-Fc fragments secreted from mouse myeloma (NS0) cells were purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed using denaturing (SDS) 12% polyacrylamide gels, either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (A and B) or Western-blotted with polyclonal anti-IgY antibodies (C and D). Samples were either non-reduced (A and C) or reduced with 2% β-mercaptoethanol (B and D). Lane 1, IgY. Lane 2, Fcν2–4. Lane 3, Fcν3–4 (C340S).

A plot of ln(cpm) against time yields a straight line, showing that a single, zero order dissociation event is involved (returning a confirmatory value of 2.05 ± 0.04 × 10–3 s–1 for k–1; Fig. 4B). The same value was obtained when biotinylated IgY, stained with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin, dissociated from the cells after the addition of unlabeled IgY,5 suggesting that the derivatization of lysine with biotin, or of tyrosine with iodine, does not perturb the IgY-receptor interaction.FIGURE 4Binding of IgY to chicken monocytes. Dissociation experiments were performed by incubating MQ-NCSU cells with 10 nm125I-IgY from chicken serum for 1 h followed by the addition of an excess of unlabeled IgY. Cells were spun through phthalate oil, and their radioactivity (in cpm) was measured at regular intervals and normalized to the initial value. The dissociation rate constant was determined by both non-linear (A) and linear (B) regression analyses. Data from a single dissociation experiment are shown. Association experiments were performed by measuring the radioactivity of cell pellets at regular intervals starting from the addition of 10 nm125I-IgY. Mean data from two duplicate experiments are shown ± S.E. (error bars)(C). All experiments were performed at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To measure the rate of association of 125I-IgY with MQ-NCSU cells, an estimate of the number of receptors per cell was made. Measurements on two different days led to an estimate of 20,000, and the likely error in this value is discussed below. The value obtained for k+1 is 1.14 ± 0.04 × 105 mol–1 s–1 (Fig. 4C). The two rate constants lead to a value for Ka = 4.95 × 107m.When the binding kinetics of the IgY-Fc fragments were determined, Fcν2–4 was found to display the same rate of dissociation as Fcν3–4 (Fig. 5A), showing that the Cν2 domain pair does not have a detectable effect on the rate of dissociation. The association rate constant for Fcν2–4 was 3.66 ± 0.16 × 105 mol–1 s–1, and for Fcν3–4, it was 1.64 ± 0.01 × 105 mol–1 s–1, which differ only by a factor of about 2 (Fig. 5B). This is not a significant difference given the errors inherent in this technique (discussed below).FIGURE 5Binding of IgY-Fc fragments to chicken monocytes.

Furthermore, the kinetics of the interaction are not affected by the presence or absence of the Cν2 domain pair, in contrast to the effect that the Cϵ2 pair has on the kinetics of IgE binding to FcϵRI (24McDonnell J.M.

Although 10 times faster than the dissociation of human IgG1 from the monocyte cell line U937 (k–1 = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 10–4 s–1) (41Shopes B. Weetall M. Holowka D. Baird B. J.

In this study, we examined changes in the NK cell repertoire and functions occurring in response to early interaction with HIV-infected DC, using an autologous in vitro NK/DC coculture system. We show that NK cell interaction with HIV-1-infected autologous monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) modulates NK receptor expression. In particular, expression of the CD85j receptor on NK cells was strongly down-regulated upon coculture with HIV-1-infected MDDC. We demonstrate that CD85j(+) NK cells exert potent control of HIV-1 replication in single-round and productively HIV-1-infected MDDC, whereas CD85j(-) NK cells induce a modest and transient decrease of HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 suppression in MDCC by CD85j(+) NK cells required cell-to-cell contact and did not appear mediated by cytotoxicity or by soluble factors. HIV-1 inhibition was abolished when NK-MDDC interaction through the CD85j receptor was blocked with a recombinant CD85j molecule, whereas inhibition was only slightly counteracted by blocking HLA class I molecules, which are known CD85j ligands. After masking HLA class I molecules with specific antibodies, a fraction of HIV-1 infected MDDC was still strongly stained by a recombinant CD85j protein. These results suggest that CD85j(+) NK cell inhibition of HIV-1 replication in MDDC is mainly mediated by CD85j interaction with an unknown ligand (distinct from HLA class I molecules) preferentially expressed on HIV-1-infected MDDC."
https://openalex.org/W1997644475,"Kv7 potassium channels whose mutations cause cardiovascular and neurological disorders are members of the superfamily of voltage-gated K(+) channels, comprising a central pore enclosed by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) and sharing a homologous S4 sensor sequence. The Kv7.1 pore-forming subunit can interact with various KCNE auxiliary subunits to form K(+) channels with very different gating behaviors. In an attempt to characterize the nature of the promiscuous gating of Kv7.1 channels, we performed a tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis of the S4 sensor and analyzed the mutation-induced perturbations in gating free energy. Perturbing the gating energetics of Kv7.1 bias most of the mutant channels towards the closed state, while fewer mutations stabilize the open state or the inactivated state. In the absence of auxiliary subunits, mutations of specific S4 residues mimic the gating phenotypes produced by co-assembly of Kv7.1 with either KCNE1 or KCNE3. Many S4 perturbations compromise the ability of KCNE1 to properly regulate Kv7.1 channel gating. The tryptophan-induced packing perturbations and cysteine engineering studies in S4 suggest that KCNE1 lodges at the inter-VSD S4-S1 interface between two adjacent subunits, a strategic location to exert its striking action on Kv7.1 gating functions."

Our current understanding of the differential contributions of genetic strain variation, serotype, and host response to disease phenotype is incomplete. Using the chinchilla model of otitis media [OM] we investigated the disease phenotype generated by the laboratory strain TIGR4 and each of thirteen clinical strains (BS68-75, BS290, BS291, BS293, BS436 and BS437); eleven of the thirteen strains have been genomically sequenced.For each strain 100 colony forming units were injected bilaterally into the tympanic bullae of 6 young adult chinchillas under general anesthesia. All animals were examined daily for local and systemic disease by a blinded observer. Pneumatic otoscopy was used to evaluate local disease, and behavioral assessments served as the measure of systemic disease. Virulence scoring was performed using a 4-point scale to assess four clinical parameters [severity and rapidity of local disease onset; and severity and rapidity of systemic disease onset] during a 10-day evaluation period. Highly significant variation was observed among the strains in their ability to cause disease and moribundity.As expected, there was a significant correlation between the rapidity of systemic disease onset and severity of systemic disease; however, there was little correlation between the severity of otoscopic changes and severity of systemic disease. Importantly, it was observed that different strains of the same serotype produced as broad an array of disease phenotypes as did strains of different serotypes. We attribute these phenotypic differences among the strains to the high degree of genomic plasticity that we have previously documented."
https://openalex.org/W2135816463,"Mathematical models can help elucidate the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics as well as the impact of control measures. The gravity model for directly transmitted diseases is currently one of the most parsimonious models for spatial epidemic spread. This model uses distance-weighted, population size-dependent coupling to estimate host movement and disease incidence in metapopulations. The model captures overall measles dynamics in terms of underlying human movement in pre-vaccination England and Wales (previously established). In spatial models, edges often present a special challenge. Therefore, to test the model's robustness, we analyzed gravity model incidence predictions for coastal cities in England and Wales. Results show that, although predictions are accurate for inland towns, they significantly underestimate coastal persistence. We examine incidence, outbreak seasonality, and public transportation records, to show that the model's inaccuracies stem from an underestimation of total contacts per individual along the coast. We rescue this predicted 'edge effect' by increasing coastal contacts to approximate the number of per capita inland contacts. These results illustrate the impact of 'edge effects' on epidemic metapopulations in general and illustrate directions for the refinement of spatiotemporal epidemic models."

Three scenarios were used to represent three treatment centres with widely varying mortality rates on cART that were differentiated by: (i) the distribution of CD4 counts of patients entering care; (ii) the age distribution of patients entering care; (iii) the average rate of monitoring the patients not on cART. At the level of the treatment centre, the fraction of Dutch MSM dying in the first three years of treatment ranged from 0% to 8%. The mathematical model captured the large variation in observed mortality between the three treatment centres. Manipulating the age-distribution of patients or the frequency of monitoring did not affect the model predictions. In contrast, when the same national average distribution of CD4 count at entry was used in all the scenarios, the variation in predicted mortality between all centres was diminished.Patients entering care with low CD4 counts appears to be the main source of variation in the mortality rates between Dutch treatment centres. Recruiting HIV-infected individuals to care earlier could lead to substantial improvements in cART outcomes. For example, if patients were to present with at least 400 CD4 cells/mm(3), as they do already in some centres, then our model predicts that the mortality in the first three years of cART could be reduced by approximately 20%."
https://openalex.org/W2095532959,"The Werner protein (WRN), defective in the premature aging disorder Werner syndrome, participates in a number of DNA metabolic processes, and we have been interested in the possible regulation of its function in DNA repair by post-translational modifications. Acetylation mediated by histone acetyltransferases is of key interest because of its potential importance in aging, DNA repair and transcription.Here, we have investigated the p300 acetylation mediated changes on the function of WRN in base excision DNA repair (BER). We show that acetylation of WRN increases in cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), suggesting that acetylation of WRN may play a role in response to DNA damage. This hypothesis is consistent with our findings that acetylation of WRN stimulates its catalytic activities in vitro and in vivo, and that acetylated WRN enhances pol beta-mediated strand displacement DNA synthesis more than unacetylated WRN. Furthermore, we show that cellular exposure to the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate stimulates long patch BER in wild type cells but not in WRN depleted cells, suggesting that acetylated WRN participates significantly in this process.Collectively, these results provide the first evidence for a specific role of p300 mediated WRN acetylation in regulating its function during BER."
https://openalex.org/W2135873510,"The sexual cycle of Plasmodium is required for transmission of malaria from mosquitoes to mammals, but how parasites induce the expression of genes required for the sexual stages is not known. We disrupted the Plasmodium yoelii gene encoding high mobility group nuclear factor hmgb2, which encodes a DNA-binding protein potentially implicated in transcriptional regulation of malaria gene expression. We investigated its function in vivo in the vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Δpyhmgb2 parasites develop into gametocytes but have drastic impairment of oocyst formation. A global transcriptome analysis of the Δpyhmgb2 parasites identified ∼30 genes whose expression is down-regulated in the Δpyhmgb2 parasites. These genes are conserved in all malaria species, and more than 90% of these genes show a peak of mRNA expression at the gametocyte stage. Surprisingly, the transcripts coding for the Plasmodium berghei orthologues of those genes are stored and translated in the ookinete stage. Therefore, sexual stage protein expression appears to be both transcriptionally and translationally regulated with Plasmodium HMGB2 acting as an important regulator of malaria sexual stage gene expression.

Therefore, sexual stage protein expression appears to be both transcriptionally and translationally regulated with Plasmodium HMGB2 acting as an important regulator of malaria sexual stage gene expression. Plasmodium species, the causative agents of malaria, are the most deadly members of the apicomplexan phylum. As with other members of the Apicomplexa, Plasmodium has a multifaceted life cycle encompassing an asexual phase within the intermediate host and a sexual cycle in the mosquito. Gametocytogenesis and gametogenesis consist of an ensemble of processes leading to the differentiation of erythrocytic forms of the parasite into male or female gametocytes. These complex and coordinated steps ensure the transmission of the parasite to the invertebrate host and are required for transmission of malaria to mammalian hosts. Gametocytes form in mammalian host, are taken up by the mosquito during a blood meal, transform into gametes in the mosquito midgut, and then fuse to form a zygote. Zygotes differentiate into ookinetes that penetrate the midgut wall and differentiate into oocysts, in which sporozoites will develop. Starting from the well controlled vertebrate milieu, the parasite must adapt to the mosquito environment where temperature fluctuates and nutrients are limited. Gametocytogenesis requires growth arrest and a differentiation step that will prepare the parasite for these changes. Sexual differentiation is accompanied by a tightly controlled gene expression program during which ∼200–300 mRNAs are specifically expressed or predominantly expressed in sexual forms of the parasite (1Alano P.

Transcriptional control of gene expression is implicated as a crucial step during this process with sex-specific transcript expression in gametocytes controlled by the sequences in the 5′-flanking regions (5Khan S.M.

For some sexual stage genes post-translational processes mediate gene expression. The genes coding for P25 and P28 ookinete proteins (PY00522 and PY00523, respectively) are transcribed at the gametocyte stage, but their translation is delayed until the gamete and zygote stages (6Kumar N. Carter R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A group of mRNAs with a common 3′-untranslated region motif are specifically transcribed at the gametocyte stage, but their translation is repressed until the parasite requires the presence of the proteins they encode (4Hall N.

Science. 2006; 313: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) was identified in Plasmodium berghei that participates in the storage and translation repression of a large number of transcripts. Therefore, sexual differentiation in Plasmodium requires fine tuning of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes to regulate gene expression. The mechanisms controlling the transition from the asexual erythrocytic stage into a gametocyte-specific gene expression program are unknown. Initial analysis of the genomes of Plasmodium species revealed few canonical transcriptional regulators (8Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Wellems T.E. Miller L.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 771-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the RNA polymerase II machinery (9Callebaut I. Prat K. Meurice E. Mornon J.P. Tomavo S. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) is conserved within Apicomplexa, and chromatin modification plays an important role in gene regulation (10Gissot M. Kelly K.A. Ajioka J.W. Greally J.M. Kim K. Plos Pathog. 2007; 3: e77Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The finding that certain DNA motifs are recurrent in the promoters of Apicomplexa and bind to nuclear factors (11Voss T.S. Kaestli M. Vogel D. Bopp S. Beck H.P. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 346: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggests that unrecognized transcription factors exist. Recently, a novel family of AP2 domain plant-like transcription factors was identified in the genomes of the Apicomplexa (14Balaji S. Babu M.M. Iyer L.M. Aravind L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3994-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In plants these transcription factors bind to specific DNA motifs and regulate a variety of biological responses (15Gutterson N. Reuber T.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), but the function of apicomplexan AP2 proteins has not been experimentally validated. Two proteins containing a high mobility group box (HMGB) 3The abbreviations used are: HMGB, high mobility group box; RT, reverse transcription; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIG, digoxigenin. are highly conserved among Plasmodium species (16Briquet S. Boschet C. Gissot M. Tissandie E. Sevilla E. Franetich J.F. Thiery I. Hamid Z. Bourgouin C. Vaquero C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HMGB box proteins are small transcriptional regulators that bind DNA in a nonsequence-specific fashion and bend it, leading to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the induction of transcription (17Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). HMGB proteins also actively participate in chromatin remodeling by increasing nucleosome sliding and accessibility of the chromatin (17Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The two Plasmodium falciparum HMGB proteins, HMGB1 (PFL0145c) and HMGB2 (MAL8P1.72), have the biochemical characteristics of the HMGB box family of transcriptional regulators (16Briquet S. Boschet C. Gissot M. Tissandie E. Sevilla E. Franetich J.F. Thiery I. Hamid Z. Bourgouin C. Vaquero C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these HMGB are differentially expressed. HMGB1 is expressed during the erythrocytic asexual cycle, whereas HMGB2 is slightly expressed at the schizont stage and highly expressed at the gametocyte stage (2Le Roch K.G. Johnson J.R. Florens L. Zhou Y. Santrosyan A. Grainger M. Yan S.F. Williamson K.C. Holder A.A. Carucci D.J. Yates III, J.R. Winzeler E.A.

Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated the role of the HMGB2 protein in regulation of sexual stage gene expression. We disrupted hmgb2 in the rodent malaria model Plasmodium yoelii and investigated its function in vivo in its two hosts, the mouse and the mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Our results indicate that PyHMGB2 plays a central and conserved role in regulating gene expression during the sexual cycle of Plasmodium. P. yoelii Life Cycle—P. yoelii YM lethal strain was maintained in naive BALB/c or Swiss Webster mice. For mosquito infection experiments, 4–5-day-old A. stephensi were fed for 15 min on anesthetized Swiss Webster mice infected with either wild-type (WT) or Δpyhmgb2 (KO) P. yoelii parasites. Prior to feeding, the abundance and the sex ratio of the gametocyte-stage parasites were checked on Giemsa-stained blood smears. At day 7 post-infection, midguts were monitored for infection, and oocysts were counted by either counting fluorescent GFP-positive KO parasite oocysts (see below) or after mercurochrome staining (WT and KO parasite lines). Salivary glands from mosquitoes on day 14 or 15 post-infective blood meal were dissected to recover sporozoites. Exflagellation experiments were performed as described in Ref. 18Arai M. Billker O. Morris H.R. Panico M. Delcroix M. Dixon D. Ley S.V. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, and exflagellation centers were counted at 9 min post-induction. Male and female gametocytes were identified by morphology on Giemsa smears. In vitro culture of ookinetes was performed as described in Ref. 19Carter V. Nacer A.M. Underhill A. Sinden R.E. Hurd H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Ookinete numbers were counted with a hemocytometer under a phase-contrast microscope and normalized to the original gametocyte content of the culture. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test available using the GraphPad Prism software package (GraphPad software, San Diego). P. yoelii Transfection, Plasmid Construction, and Genotyping—A fragment of the pyhmgb2 gene (PY07077) amplified from YM strain genomic DNA using primers 5′-ggatccATTACATGTTATGATCTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-gcggccgcCAATGCTCTCTTTGGAGCTAATG-3′ was inserted into the pMD205-GFP vector in the BamHI and NotI restriction sites. An SpeI restriction site was created by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at nucleotide position 258 of the cloned fragment (position 3152 of the MALPY02526 contig sequence) using the following primer, 5′-TACAACTTTAGAACAAGACTAGTACTGTTTTGAAACAACTCA-3′. Prior to transfection, the targeting plasmid was linearized using an SpeI site created in the pyhmgb2 open reading frame. Transfections were performed as described previously (20Jongco A.M. Ting L.M. Thathy V. Mota M.M. Kim K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 146: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Mota M.M. Thathy V. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cloning was performed after limiting dilution and infection of 20 BALB/c mice. A WT nonrecombinant clone was passaged in parallel with KO clones so that mouse and mosquito passage numbers were comparable for all experiments. Diagnostic PCR was performed using the primers T7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and A (5′-ATCGATTAGTAGAATATGTAATATA-3′) as indicated in Fig. 1. A probe containing a portion of the pyhmgb2 gene was amplified by PCR and digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled using the DIG random prime labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Southern blot was performed after running 1 μg of HindIII-digested genomic DNA on a 0.8% agarose gel and passive transfer on a nylon membrane and revealed using an anti-DIG antibody coupled to peroxidase (Roche Applied Science). Infectivity and Survival Assays—Five BALB/c or Swiss Webster mice per group were infected intravenously using 5 × 105 and 1 × 106 parasites, respectively. Beginning 24 h after injection, a thin smear of blood was prepared daily and stained with Giemsa reagent. For each sample, at least 1000 red blood cells were examined by microscopy, and the percentage of parasitized erythrocytes was calculated. Mouse viability was monitored every 12 h. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad software, San Diego). Microarray Design and Experiments—Two mice per group were infected with 1 million purified schizonts from the WT and two clones (B3 and D1) of the Δpyhmgb2 lines. When parasitemia reached 10–20% and equivalent gametocytemia, total RNA was extracted from the WT and the B3 and D1 clones of the KO parasite lines using the TRIzol method on saponinlysed parasites. For each group, RNA originating from the two mice was pooled. Total RNA integrity was checked using the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine shared sequencing facility. P. yoelii microarrays were produced in the Molecular Genomics Core Facility, Drexel University College of Medicine, under the direction of L. Bergman. The spotted microarray contained 7,080 65-mer oligonucleotides (probes). Each probe was spotted twice on the array. The array has been developed and previously evaluated with hybridizations of total RNA extracted from blood stages. Probe sequences were blasted against annotated P. yoelii genes downloaded from PlasmoDB (version 5.2). In total, 6,451 probes were specifically mapped to 6,428 annotated P. yoelii genes with a perfect match (22Tarun A.S. Peng X. Dumpit R.F. Ogata Y. Silva-Rivera H. Camargo N. Daly T.M. Bergman L.W. Kappe S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To prepare each probe, 10 μg of P. yoelii RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in the presence of aminoallyl-dUTP (FairPlay microarray labeling kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA was then fluorescently labeled by reaction with monofunctional, normal N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Cy3 or Cy5 dye (Amersham Biosciences). The Cy dye-labeled cDNA was purified, and the yield and specific activity of each probe were determined by absorption spectroscopy. Pairs of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were pooled and hybridized to the P. yoelii microarrays for 14–16 h at 60 °C in a 60-μl mixture. Following hybridization and washing, slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000A microarray laser scanner (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), and the fluorescence intensity of each DNA feature was determined at 532 nm (Cy3) and at 635 nm (Cy5). Data for each gene were obtained from replicate features (n = 2). On a second set of arrays, the assignments of Cy3 and Cy5 for labeling of the paired cDNA probes were reversed (standard dye flip). Gene expression data were acquired and analyzed using the GenePixPro 5.0 and Acuity 3.0 Microarray Informatics software (Axon Instruments). Two biological replicates with the proper dye swap controls were performed resulting in a total of eight hybridization signals from each parasite line for each gene represented on the microarray. Data have been deposited to GEO data base (GSE9952) together with the microarray platform (GPL5381). Microarray Normalization and Statistical Analysis—The .gpr files were loaded using the Bioconductor limma package. Quality assessment of the microarrays was performed using the package arrayQuality. The data were then normalized to remove systematic technical variation. Two-channel normalization was performed using the function maNorm in the package marray. Three types of normalization were performed as follows: (i) using the median enabling global median location normalization; (ii) using a global normalization using the scatter-plot smoother loess; (iii) a two-dimension spatial normalization using the loess function. Selection of differentially expressed genes was performed using the package limma that is based on the fitting of the expression data for each gene to a linear model. Empirical Bayes were then used to borrow information across genes making the analyses stable even for experiments with a small number of arrays (23Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (article 3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9247) Google Scholar). In this method, the basic statistic used for significance analysis is the moderated t statistic. Moderated t statistic leads to p values with increased degrees of freedom reflecting the greater reliability associated with smoothed standards errors (24Smyth G.K. Gentleman R Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions Using R and Bioconductor. Springer-Verlag, New York2005: 397-420Crossref Google Scholar). A p value cutoff to 0.05 was set leading to a false discovery rate of 5%. RT-PCR and Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—One microgram of DNase-treated total RNA was utilized to produce cDNA following the instructions of the first strand cDNA kit (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) as a primer. PCR was performed during 30 cycles using the following primers: pyada forward (5′-ATGATGGAAATTCCAACTGAAGA-3′) and pyada reverse (5′-TTAAAAGTACAACGCTTTAAGCTCG-3′); pyhmgb2 forward (5′-CCTATCAAGTGTGTTGTATATGTCTTC-3′) and pyhmgb2 reverse (5′-TCTTCTATTTCTTTGGAATAACGAAC-3′). Real time quantitative PCR was performed on the 7300 ABI apparatus using the Power Sybr (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) mastermix in a 20-μl volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers were designed using the Primerexpress software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to amplify regions of 100–150 nucleotides. Each experiment was performed at least two times in duplicate. A list of other primers used for verification of microarray results by real time quantitative RT-PCR is available in the supplemental material. Western Blotting—Ookinete cultures of WT and KO parasites containing a similar number of ookinetes (∼1 × 106) were harvested by centrifugation and extracted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The extracts were size-fractionated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-Pys21 (Pys21 is also known as Pys28 and is a member of the P28 family that includes Pbs21, Pfs28, and Pvs28) and anti-Pys25 antibodies (gift from Dr. T. Tsuboi, Ehime University, Japan (25Tsuboi T. Cao Y.M. Hitsumoto Y. Yanagi T. Kanbara H. Torii M. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2260-2264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), diluted 1/500 and an anti-PyADA antibody diluted 1/1000 in a phosphate-buffered saline, 5% milk solution. The membrane was then incubated 1 h at room temperature with a 1/10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. After extensive washing, signal was revealed using a chemiluminescent substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Relative amounts of proteins were determined by densitometry using the Quantiscan software (Densylab, Microvision Instruments, Evry, France). Relative expression of Pys25 and Pys21 (or Pys28) in wild-type and KO was normalized by comparing the level of expression of the PyADA protein in each sample. Disruption of the Pyhmgb2 Locus—Disruption of the pyhmgb2 locus was performed after integration of a plasmid containing a segment of the pyhmgb2 gene and the selectable marker cassette PbDHFR-TS fused to the GFP gene. The integration of this plasmid at the pyhmgb2 locus created two copies of the truncated gene after a single crossover event (Fig. 1A). Two independent pyhmgb2 knock-out clones (Δpyhmgb2; clones B3 and D1) were verified by PCR of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B and data not shown) and Southern blot using a pyhmgb2 gene probe (Fig. 1C). Disruption of the pyhmgb2 locus resulted in a total loss of detectable pyhmgb2 transcript expression by RT-PCR for the two clones (Fig. 1D and data not shown), whereas the transcript of an unrelated gene (pyada (PY020760) Fig. 1D, right panel) was not affected. Real time quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed that no residual expression of pyhmgb2 gene could be detected. The PyHMGB2 KO Parasites Are Slightly Attenuated during the Asexual Erythrocytic Cycle—We studied the effect of the disruption of the pyhmgb2 locus on the asexual erythrocytic stage by examining growth of the parasite (Fig. 2A) as well as survival curves of mice infected by the WT or the Δpyhmgb2 parasite strains (Fig. 2B). Δpyhmgb2 parasite strains were able to proliferate normally, and parasitemia was readably detectable after day 4. However, there was a delay in the onset of parasitemia in the Δpyhmgb2-infected mice when compared with the WT parasite strain (Fig. 2A), and the mice infected by the Δpyhmgb2 parasite strains survived longer, dying at days 8–9 post-infection, whereas mice infected with the WT parasite strain died 6–8 days after infection (Fig. 2B). The delay in the onset of parasitemia and the change in the kinetics of death of the mice were reproducible in experiments with both BALB/c and Swiss Webster mice (data not shown). The Δpyhmgb2 Parasites Form Gametocytes and Ookinetes—We examined whether the Δpyhmgb2 parasites could complete the sexual cycle. The number of gametocytes on Giemsa-stained blood smears was similar in mice infected with Δpyhmgb2 parasite strains compared with the WT parasite after 2 days of infection (Table 1). There were no significant differences in the level of mature gametocytes between the Δpyhmgb2 parasite strains and the WT. The parasites were able to undergo gametocyte exflagellation (Table 1), but Δpyhmgb2 strains produced a decreased number of ookinetes when compared with the WT (Table 1).TABLE 1Δpyhmgb2 parasites form in vitro ookinetes less efficientlyGametocytemiaaPercentage of gametocytes per 100 red blood cells is shown.

Open table in a new tab The Δpyhmgb2 Parasites Have Dramatically Impaired Oocyst Production—We fed mosquitoes on mice infected with Δpyhmgb2 and WT parasite strains bearing similar numbers of gametocytes and asexual stages. Eight days after feeding, mosquito midguts were dissected, and the number of oocysts was scored using light microscopy. The number of infected mosquitoes for each strain was similar in each experiment (Table 2). In three independent experiments, the mean number of oocysts per Δpyhmgb2-infected mosquito was ∼10% of the mean oocyst number seen in WT parasite-infected mosquitoes (Table 2). The oocysts produced by Δpyhmgb2-infected mosquitoes were able to complete the life cycle and produce viable sporozoites that were infectious to mice. The blood of the mice infected by those sporozoites was collected 1 week after infection. Using real time quantitative PCR, we showed that these parasites do not express the pyhmgb2 transcript and have the same genotype as the Δpyhmgb2 parent (data not shown), indicating that no reversion of the disrupted allele had occurred.TABLE 2Δpyhmg2 in vivo oocyst production is impairedMean number of oocystsaThe mean number of oocysts per infected mosquito ± S.D. is shown.Oocyst prevalencebPercentage of mosquito midguts containing oocysts is shown. 50 midguts were dissected for each experiment.Experiment 1 WT65.5 ± 2494.1 KO7.8 ± 4.9cData are statistically significant in a non-paired t test (p value <0.0001).81.6Experiment 2 WT92.1 ± 38100.0 KO15.7 ± 7.8cData are statistically significant in a non-paired t test (p value <0.0001).82.0Experiment 3 WT64 ± 1948.0 KO4.3 ± 3.2cData are statistically significant in a non-paired t test (p value <0.0001).48.0a The mean number of oocysts per infected mosquito ± S.D. is shown.b Percentage of mosquito midguts containing oocysts is shown. 50 midguts were dissected for each experiment.c Data are statistically significant in a non-paired t test (p value <0.0001).

These arrays have been previously validated to accurately reflect blood stage and liver stage P. yoelii gene expression (22Tarun A.S. Peng X. Dumpit R.F. Ogata Y. Silva-Rivera H. Camargo N. Daly T.M.

We harvested total RNA from a mixture of synchronized late erythrocytic stage parasites with similar numbers of gametocytes. Two independent clones of the Δpyhmgb2 parasites were compared with the WT strain. Of the 6,428 annotated P. yoelii genes spotted on the array, only 32 genes showed differential expression in the KO (Table 3). It is interesting to note that we found only down-regulated genes in the Δpyhmgb2 parasites. There was no detectable difference in expression of the transcript for Pyhmgb1 (PY05184).TABLE 3Microarray analysis of ΔPyhmgb2 clones reveals down-regulation of conserved sexual stage genesAnnotationFCaFC indicates fold change calculated as normalized signal intensity of the wild type P. yoelii YM divided by normalized signal intensity of the KO (two clones).

https://openalex.org/W2068960164,"The protein Ure2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses prion properties at the origin of the [URE3] trait. In vivo, a high molecular weight form of inactive Ure2p is associated to [URE3]. The faithful and continued propagation of [URE3]is dependent on the expression levels of molecular chaperones from the Hsp100, -70, and -40 families; however, so far, their role is not fully documented. Here we investigate the effects of molecular chaperones from the Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp100 families and the chaperonin CCT/Tric on the assembly of full-length Ure2p. We show that Hsp104p greatly stimulates Ure2p aggregation, whereas Ssa1p, Ydj1p, Sis1p, and Hsp82p inhibit aggregation to different extents. The nature of the high molecular weight Ure2p species that forms in the presence of the different molecular chaperones and their nucleotide dependence is described. We show that Hsp104p favors the aggregation of Ure2p into non-fibrillar high molecular weight particles, whereas Ssa1p, Ydj1p, Sis1p, and Hsp82p sequester Ure2p in spherical oligomers. Using fluorescently labeled full-length Ure2p and Ure2p-(94-354) and fluorescence polarization, we show that Ssa1p binding to Ure2p is ATP-dependent, whereas that of Hsp104p is not. We also show that Ssa1p preferentially interacts with the N-terminal domain of Ure2p that is critical for prion propagation, whereas Ydj1p preferentially interacts with the C-terminal domain of the protein, and we discuss the significance of this observation. Finally, the affinities of Ssa1p, Ydj1p, and Hsp104p for Ure2p are determined. Our in vitro observations bring new insight into the mechanism by which molecular chaperones influence the propagation of [URE3]."

Further, extensive clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the therapeutic role of TMS in disorders such as depression. Because TMS causes strong peripheral effects such as auditory clicks and muscle twitches, experimental artifacts such as subject bias and placebo effect are clear concerns. Several sham TMS methods have been developed, but none of the techniques allows one to intermix real and sham TMS on a trial-by-trial basis in a double-blind manner. We have developed an attachment that allows fast, automated switching between Standard TMS and two types of control TMS (Sham and Reverse) without movement of the coil or reconfiguration of the setup. We validate the setup by performing mathematical modeling, search-coil and physiological measurements. To see if the stimulus conditions can be blinded, we conduct perceptual discrimination and sensory perception studies. We verify that the physical properties of the stimulus are appropriate, and that successive stimuli do not contaminate each other. We find that the threshold for motor activation is significantly higher for Reversed than for Standard stimulation, and that Sham stimulation entirely fails to activate muscle potentials. Subjects and experimenters perform poorly at discriminating between Sham and Standard TMS with a figure-of-eight coil, and between Reverse and Standard TMS with a circular coil. Our results raise the possibility of utilizing this technique for a wide range of applications."
https://openalex.org/W1986683091,"Child neglect is the most common form of child maltreatment, yet the biological basis of maternal neglect is poorly understood and a rodent model is lacking.The current study characterizes a population of mice (MaD1) which naturally exhibit maternal neglect (little or no care of offspring) at an average rate of 17% per generation. We identified a set of risk factors that can predict future neglect of offspring, including decreased self-grooming and elevated activity. At the time of neglect, neglectful mothers swam significantly more in a forced swim test relative to nurturing mothers. Cross-fostered offspring raised by neglectful mothers in turn exhibit increased expression of risk factors for maternal neglect and decreased maternal care as adults, suggestive of possible epigenetic contributions to neglect. Unexpectedly, offspring from neglectful mothers elicited maternal neglect from cross-fostered nurturing mothers, suggesting that factors regulating neglect are not solely within the mother. To identify a neurological pathway underlying maternal neglect, we examined brain activity in neglectful and nurturing mice. c-Fos expression was significantly elevated in neglectful relative to nurturing mothers in the CNS, particularly within dopamine associated areas, such as the zona incerta (ZI), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens. Phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase (a marker for dopamine production) was significantly elevated in ZI and higher in VTA (although not significantly) in neglectful mice. Tyrosine hydroxylase levels were unaltered, suggesting a dysregulation of dopamine activity rather than cell number. Phosphorylation of DARPP-32, a marker for dopamine D1-like receptor activation, was elevated within nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen in neglectful versus nurturing dams.These findings suggest that atypical dopamine activity within the maternal brain, especially within regions involved in reward, is involved in naturally occurring neglect and that MaD1 mice are a useful model for understanding the basis of naturally occurring neglect."

Although an improved understanding of how germline genetic variants interact with other cancer risk factors may allow better prevention and treatment of human cancer, measuring and quantifying these interactions is challenging. In other areas of research, Information Theory has been used to quantitatively describe similar multivariate interactions. We implemented a novel information-theoretic analysis to measure the joint effect of a high frequency germline genetic variant of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway (MDM2 SNP309 T/G) and gender on clinical cancer phenotypes. This analysis quantitatively describes synergistic interactions among gender, the MDM2 SNP309 locus, and the age of onset of tumorigenesis in p53 mutation carriers. These results offer a molecular and genetic basis for the observed sexual dimorphism of cancer risk in p53 mutation carriers and a model is proposed that suggests a novel cancer prevention strategy for p53 mutation carriers."
https://openalex.org/W1997724861,"Although cells can exit mitotic block aberrantly by mitotic slippage, they are prevented from becoming tetraploids by a p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint. Intriguingly, disruption of the spindle-assembly checkpoint also compromises the postmitotic checkpoint. The precise mechanism of the interplay between these two pivotal checkpoints is not known. We found that after prolonged nocodazole exposure, the postmitotic checkpoint was facilitated by p53. We demonstrated that although disruption of the mitotic block by a MAD2-binding protein promoted slippage, it did not influence the activation of p53. Both p53 and its downstream target p21(CIP1/WAF1) were activated at the same rate irrespective of whether the spindle-assembly checkpoint was enforced or not. The accelerated S phase entry, as reflected by the premature accumulation of cyclin E relative to the activation of p21(CIP1/WAF1), is the reason for the uncoupling of the postmitotic checkpoint. In support of this hypothesis, forced premature mitotic exit with a specific CDK1 inhibitor triggered DNA replication without affecting the kinetics of p53 activation. Finally, replication after checkpoint bypass was boosted by elevating the level of cyclin E. These observations indicate that disruption of the spindle-assembly checkpoint does not directly influence p53 activation, but the shortening of the mitotic arrest allows cyclin E-CDK2 to be activated before the accumulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1). These data underscore the critical relationship between the spindle-assembly checkpoint and the postmitotic checkpoint in safeguarding chromosomal stability."
https://openalex.org/W2042728738,"Voltage-gated K+ channels comprise a central pore enclosed by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). While movement of the S4 helix is known to couple to channel gate opening and closing, the nature of S4 motion is unclear. Here, we substituted S4 residues of Kv7.1 channels by cysteine and recorded whole-cell mutant channel currents in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. In the closed state, disulfide and metal bridges constrain residue S225 (S4) nearby C136 (S1) within the same VSD. In the open state, two neighboring I227 (S4) are constrained at proximity while residue R228 (S4) is confined close to C136 (S1) of an adjacent VSD. Structural modeling predicts that in the closed to open transition, an axial rotation (∼190°) and outward translation of S4 (∼12 Å) is accompanied by VSD rocking. This large sensor motion changes the intra-VSD S1–S4 interaction to an inter-VSD S1–S4 interaction. These constraints provide a ground for cooperative subunit interactions and suggest a key role of the S1 segment in steering S4 motion during Kv7.1 gating."
https://openalex.org/W2049170781,"Background The Beijing family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is dominant in countries in East Asia. Genomic polymorphisms are a source of diversity within the M. tuberculosis genome and may account for the variation of virulence among M. tuberculosis isolates. Till date there are no studies that have examined the genomic composition of M. tuberculosis isolates from the high TB-burden country, Myanmar. Methodology/Principle Findings Twenty-two M. tuberculosis isolates from Myanmar were screened on whole-genome arrays containing genes from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis CDC1551 and M. bovis AF22197. Screening identified 198 deletions or extra regions in the clinical isolates compared to H37Rv. Twenty-two regions differentiated between Beijing and non-Beijing isolates and were verified by PCR on an additional 40 isolates. Six regions (Rv0071-0074 [RD105], Rv1572-1576c [RD149], Rv1585c-1587c [RD149], MT1798-Rv1755c [RD152], Rv1761c [RD152] and Rv0279c) were deleted in Beijing isolates, of which 4 (Rv1572-1576c, Rv1585c-1587c, MT1798-Rv1755c and Rv1761c) were variably deleted among ST42 isolates, indicating a closer relationship between the Beijing and ST42 lineages. The TbD1 region, Mb1582-Mb1583 was deleted in Beijing and ST42 isolates. One M. bovis gene of unknown function, Mb3184c was present in all isolates, except 11 of 13 ST42 isolates. The CDC1551 gene, MT1360 coding for a putative adenylate cyclase, was present in all Beijing and ST42 isolates (except 1). The pks15/1 gene, coding for a putative virulence factor, was intact in all Beijing and non-Beijing isolates, except in ST42 and ST53 isolates. Conclusion This study describes previously unreported deletions/extra regions in Beijing and non-Beijing M. tuberculosis isolates. The modern and highly frequent ST42 lineage showed a closer relationship to the hypervirulent Beijing lineage than to the ancient non-Beijing lineages. The pks15/1 gene was disrupted only in modern non-Beijing isolates. This is the first report of an in-depth analysis on the genomic diversity of M. tuberculosis isolates from Myanmar."

This method captures the difference between the fast, step-like onset of APs in rat neocortical neurons and the gradual, exponential-like AP onset in identified snail neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2005883679,"Allometric equations are widely used in many branches of biological science. The potential information content of the normalization constant b in allometric equations of the form Y = bX(a) has, however, remained largely neglected. To demonstrate the potential for utilizing this information, I generated a large number of artificial datasets that resembled those that are frequently encountered in biological studies, i.e., relatively small samples including measurement error or uncontrolled variation. The value of X was allowed to vary randomly within the limits describing different data ranges, and a was set to a fixed theoretical value. The constant b was set to a range of values describing the effect of a continuous environmental variable. In addition, a normally distributed random error was added to the values of both X and Y. Two different approaches were then used to model the data. The traditional approach estimated both a and b using a regression model, whereas an alternative approach set the exponent a at its theoretical value and only estimated the value of b. Both approaches produced virtually the same model fit with less than 0.3% difference in the coefficient of determination. Only the alternative approach was able to precisely reproduce the effect of the environmental variable, which was largely lost among noise variation when using the traditional approach. The results show how the value of b can be used as a source of valuable biological information if an appropriate regression model is selected."
https://openalex.org/W2009837779,"Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are useful for detecting weak homology in protein sequence analysis, and they are thought to contain some essential signatures of the protein families. In order to elucidate what kind of ingredients constitute such family-specific signatures, we apply singular value decomposition to a set of PSSMs and examine the properties of dominant right and left singular vectors. The first right singular vectors were correlated with various amino acid indices including relative mutability, amino acid composition in protein interior, hydropathy, or turn propensity, depending on proteins. A significant correlation between the first left singular vector and a measure of site conservation was observed. It is shown that the contribution of the first singular component to the PSSMs act to disfavor potentially but falsely functionally important residues at conserved sites. The second right singular vectors were highly correlated with hydrophobicity scales, and the corresponding left singular vectors with contact numbers of protein structures. It is suggested that sequence alignment with a PSSM is essentially equivalent to threading supplemented with functional information. In addition, singular vectors may be useful for analyzing and annotating the characteristics of conserved sites in protein families."

The wide spread of microorganisms consequently mean that drosophilids also can be found on a broad range of substrates. One of the more peculiar types of habitat is shown by three species of flies that have colonized land crabs. In spite of their intriguing lifestyle, the crab flies have remained poorly studied. Perhaps the least investigated of the three crab flies is the Cayman Island endemic Drosophila endobranchia. Apart from its life cycle very little is known about this species, including its phylogenetic position, which has remained unresolved due to a cryptic set of characteristics.Based on molecular data, corroborated by a re-analysis of the morphological make up, we have resolved the phylogenetic position of D. endobranchia and show that it somewhat surprisingly belongs to the large Neotropical repleta radiation, and should be considered as an aberrant member of the canalinea species group. Furthermore we also provide additional data on the behavior of these remarkable flies.Our findings reveal that the two Caribbean crab flies are not as distantly related as first thought, as both species are members of the derived repleta radiation. That this lineage has given rise to two species with the same odd type of breeding substrate is curious and prompts the question of what aspects of their shared ancestry has made these flies suitable for a life on (and inside) land crabs. Knowledge of the phylogenetic position of D. endobranchia will allow for comparative explorations and will aid in efforts aimed at understanding processes involved in drastic host shifts and extreme specialization."

A series of mechanisms have been described that contribute to the progression of this debilitating disorder. A large body of evidence points at contributing factors such as altered apoptotic behavior of cells, the presence of a number of inflammatory cytokines, as well as the massive accumulation of lymphocytes at affected sites (1Bird H.A. Snaith M.L. Bird H.A. Sneith M.L. Challenges in Rheumatoid Arthritis. 1st Ed. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1999: 1-399Google Scholar). Others, pointing at the abnormal production of rheumatoid factors in RA, favor the hypothesis that RA is an autoimmune disease or, referring to data regarding certain major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, link the onset of RA to certain genetic factors (1Bird H.A.

Rantapaa-Dahlqvist S. Berglin E. Stolt P. Padyukov L. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2004; 63: 28-31Google Scholar). Alternative hypotheses, however, refer to the fact that archeological signs of RA in the New World can be traced back more than 5000 years, whereas similar evidence is absent in the Old World before the 18th century (8Perl A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1999; 58: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Such a marked geographic distribution has been interpreted as being consistent with the important role of environmental factors such as viruses in the genesis of RA (8Perl A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1999; 58: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One of the most compelling hypotheses, however, implicates a special cell type found in the synovium of RA-affected joints, namely activated and proliferating fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), as playing an exceptionally important role in the genesis of RA. In support of this hypothesis, convincing evidence has been presented that FLS isolated from RA patients alone are sufficient to initiate and to propagate RA (9Geiler T. Kriegsmann J. Keyszer G.M. Gay R.E. Gay S. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1664-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Pap T. Muller-Ladner U. Gay R.E. Gay S.

Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1549-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One of the early signs of RA are swollen joints. A hallmark of these swollen joints is the presence of large amounts of hyaluronan (HA). HA forms a fine layer in healthy joints. In RA-affected joints, however, HA levels can reach enormous levels that in some cases can be more than 100 times higher than what is found in healthy joints. In RA patients, even plasma levels of HA are elevated to such a degree that they could serve as a reliable marker of RA progression (12Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. Ann. Med. 1996; 28: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although small amounts of HA are essential for proper joint function, unfettered HA production is associated with a number of detrimental effects. Because HA accumulation is one of the early events in RA, I became interested in analyzing the expression pattern of HAS in synoviocytes isolated from RA patients. My working hypothesis is based on the assumption that in RA, one or more of the HA-coding genes might become unregulated, leading to the unwanted overproduction of HA. As a consequence, either HA itself or its degradation products might propagate inflammation in affected joints. Such a model, in which unfettered HA release sets in motion a series of events, is supported by the well known fact that HA degradation products clearly possess proinflammatory properties, act as chemoattractants, and have angiogenic properties, all highly undesired features in RA and in many other inflammatory settings (13Agren U.M. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We demonstrated earlier that hyaluronan synthase (HAS)2 and HAS3 are genes that are constitutively activated in FLS but also that mRNA levels of the gene encoding HAS1 are very low or undetectable (14Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We showed that among the HAS genes in this cell type HAS1 is the only one that readily responded to a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) IL-1α, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, as well as IL-8, but also to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (14Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, we also demonstrated that IL-1β-induced HAS1 activation is a process that depends on the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that is know to be essential for the activation of most pro-inflammatory genes (15Siebenlist U.S. Brown K. Franzoso G. Bauerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression, Environmental Stresses and Nutrients. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1995: 93-141Google Scholar). These data led me to speculate that it might be the HAS1 product that contributes and/or accounts for inflammatory processes associated with RA. In recent years, effects of cytokines as well as of particular growth factors on genes encoding HAS have been studied and reported in increasing detail. Although it has been known that viruses can affect HA levels in tissues, I am are not aware of studies investigating the effects of virus infection on the particular HAS genes, nor of studies that might have elaborated on the structural requirements and molecular mechanisms of virus-induced changes in HAS expression and HA accumulation. Here, data of in vitro experiments are shown that detail some of the effects and mechanisms of changes of HA in FLS exposed to live virus and synthetic viral analogs.

Hyaluronan Measurements—HA was quantitated via a procedure provided by Corgenix (Corgenix, Westminster, CO), the provider of the HA measurement kits. In short, plates coated with HA-binding protein were incubated with supernatant (10 μl of supernatant diluted with 90 μl of reaction buffer) or standards, respectively, for 1 h (room temperature) in duplicates, washed five times with washing buffer, incubated with a solution containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated HA-binding protein for 1 h at room temperature, washed again five times, and incubated with 100 μl of the provided substrate solution. After ∼20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal amount of sulfuric acid (0.36 n). The resulting absorbance values were measured at 450 nm (630 nm reference). Absorbance values of standards were used to calculate unknown HA levels using a third-order polynominal regression analysis performed with a universal assay calculation program (AssayZap, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

All polymers were resuspended in endotoxin-free water. At all times, repetitive pipetting and/or excessive vortexing of solutions containing polynucleotides was avoided. Furthermore, rather than preparing serial dilutions in plastic tubes, polymers were added directly to cell culture dishes. Such a procedure was opted for to minimize loss of nucleotides because of absorption of polymers to pipette tips, plastic tubes, or tissue culture dishes. Cell Culture—A series of human CD90-positive fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) isolated from RA patients was used for the reported experiments. These cells were either purchased from Dominion Pharmakine (Dominion Pharmakine, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain) or were a gift from Prof. G. Steiner (Department of Rheumatology, Medical University of Vienna). FLS were characterized by flow cytometry for the phenotype-specific marker CD90, and such data revealed a purity of ≥98%. Selected experiments were also repeated with cells that had been isolated, characterized, and cultured in our laboratory as described previously (14Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were used from passage 3 to 8. Furthermore, FLS grown to high density were utilized for the experimental data presented herein. FLS were cultured in a humidified chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and the antibiotics penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). In the early stages of cell cultivation (passage 0-3), fungizone (0.2 μg/ml) was added to cells kept in T75 (75-cm2) flasks. After reaching confluence, FLS were routinely split at a ratio of 1:3. EMSA experiments were done using cells cultured in 10-cm dishes. For all other experiments, FLS were transferred to 6-well cell culture dishes. Western Blot Experiments—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out essentially as described (16Markovic M. Stuhlmeier K.M. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Proteins were made visible using RenaissancePlus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Kodak BioMax MR films or the chemiluminescence detection device GeneGnome (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). In Western blot experiments, lower concentrations of proteins were loaded on separate gels that served as controls for loading and protein transfer. Such blots were stained with an antibody recognizing tubulin and/or with Ponceau Red. Real Time RT-PCR, Data Analysis, and Quality Controls—Gene expression in FLS was measured by real time RT-PCR on an Mx3000P (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), using SYBR green as reporter fluorophore for quantitating mRNA levels. Results are expressed as relative threshold cycle (ΔCt values) (Ct values of mRNA levels in stimulated cells minus Ct values of a given gene in resting cells). Basal mRNA expression levels in unstimulated FLS were chosen to represent 1× expression of a given gene. Amplification curves and equations for calculations have been reported elsewhere (17Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42766-42773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Primers used in real time PCR experiments were selected based on published data (14Stuhlmeier K.M.

Rheumatology. 2004; 43: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or generated with the help of software provided by the supplier of the primers MWG Biotech AG. After optimization of PCR conditions, RT-PCR was performed using the following standard settings: initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C, denaturation for 10 s, annealing for 15 s at 57 °C, and extension for 15 s at 72 °C. Each RT-PCR experiment included a dissociation curve to verify the specificity of the amplicon, as well as no template controls. mRNA for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) was co-amplified and used as a control for quantification. Primers used in real time PCR experiments were ordered from MWG Biotech AG and dissolved at a concentration of 100 pmol/μl in Tris-EDTA. Primer sequences are as follows: HAS1 (sense primer), 5′-GAC TCC TGG GTC AGC TTC CTA AG-3′, and HAS1 (antisense primer), 5′-AAA CTG CTG CAA GAG GTT AT TCC T-3′; HAS2 (sense primer), 5′-CTA TGC TTG ACC CAG CCT CAT C-3′, and HAS2 (antisense primer), 5′-ACA CTG CTG AGG AAT GAG ATC CA-3′; HAS3 (sense), 5′-ACA GGT TTC TTC CCC TTC TTC C-3′, and HAS3 (antisense), 5′-GCG ACA TGA AGA TCA TCT CTG C-3′; HPRT1 (sense), 5′-TGA CAC TGG CAA AAC AAT GCA-3′, and HPRT1 (antisense), 5′-GGT CCT TTT CAC CAG CAA GCT-3′. The length of amplified fragments are as follows: HPRT, 93 bp; HAS1, 117 bp; HAS2, 107 bp; and HAS3, 166 bp. The correct length of the PCR product was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoreses. Standards and samples were assayed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 2× Brilliant SYBR green QPCR Master Mix, 30 nm reference dye (carboxy-X-rhodamine), 1.5 μl of forward and reverse primer, cDNA (2.5 μl), and double distilled H2O. EMSA—Preparation of nuclear extract, execution of EMSA, and EMSA specificity control experiments have been described in detail on a number of occasions (16Markovic M. Stuhlmeier K.M. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Stuhlmeier K.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Stuhlmeier K.M. Csizmadia V. Cheng Q. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2186-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In short, oligonucleotides resembling consensus binding sites for NF-κB(5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′), AP-1 (c-Jun) (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′), and CRE (5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′)) were purchased from Promega (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Mutated NF-κB oligonucleotides (5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In addition, double-stranded oligonucleotides synthesized by MWG Biotech (5′-CAC GGG GGA ATT TCT CTC TGC-3′) have been used as well. This element is identical to the sequence found -1331 to -1320 bp upstream of the HAS1 start codon that resemble a NF-κB binding domain (≥80% minimum matrix conservation). The sequence has been located with the help of Alibaba2.1. The underlined sequence in this region of the HAS1 promoter (5′-GGG AAT TTC T-3′) contains, among others, prospective binding sites for NF-κB, RelA and NF-κB2. All double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP according to the protocol provided by Promega. After labeling and purification by chromatography, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with ∼100,000 cpm of labeled probe in the presence of 1.5 μg of poly(dI,dC). The resulting mixture was separated on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel. For specific competition, 7 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleotides were included. For nonspecific competition, 7 pmol of double-stranded nucleotides were used. For supershift assays, 1 μl of specific supershift antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the nuclear extract solution ∼15 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Controls and Statistical Analysis—Basal mRNA expression levels in unstimulated FLS or control animals were chosen to represent 1× expression of a given gene. Time course experiments (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, IκBα degradation, and EMSA) were done twice; all other experiments were done at least three times. At selected time points, EMSA as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay time course data were confirmed by additional experiments. Control experiments for EMSA such as supershift and competition experiments were performed as published (17Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42766-42773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A number of quality controls, routinely performed to ensure RT-PCR specificity and linearity, have been reported elsewhere (16Markovic M. Stuhlmeier K.M. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol.

Statistical analysis was done using the unpaired t test; p values ≤0.05 are considered significant. EBV and Synthetic Double-stranded Viral RNA (dsRNA) Analogs Induce HAS1 Synthesis and HA Release in FLS—EBV has been linked to the onset of RA (22Costenbader K.H. Karlson E.W. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2006; 8: 204Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Whether exposure of FLS to EBV changes HAS expression patterns and to what degree HA synthesis is affected have been the focus of experiments shown in Fig. 1. FLS, grown to high density, were left untreated (Fig. 1, lane w/o), treated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml), or were exposed to purified, active EBV virus at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 30 μg/ml medium. FLS were exposed to the virus for 1 h, and for the remaining hours of these experiments the virus concentration was 1/6 of the indicated initial concentration. The reason is that the total amount of medium initially was 0.5 ml per tissue culture dish, after 1 h; however, medium was added to the final amount of 3 ml used in all other culture dishes. Experiments were terminated after 8 h. HAS1 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in response to EBV treatment. HAS2 and HAS3 mRNA levels, however, were largely unchanged (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, FLS exposed to 30 μg/ml (1 × 109 virus particles/ml) of viable EBV respond similarly to cells exposed to IL-1β, one of the strongest inducers of HAS1 in FLS (14Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IL-1β data were generated from three independent experiments; mRNA levels of the EBV dose curve are the means ± S.D. of two independent experiments. Next I tested whether elevated HAS1 mRNA levels also translate into higher HA synthesis by FLS exposed to EBV. Shown in Fig. 1B are data that demonstrate that similar to IL-1β (5 ng/ml), EBV (30 μg/ml) also induces the release of significantly increased amounts of HA into the culture supernatant (n = 3; p ≤ 0.05). In addition, cells that were exposed to the synthetic viral RNA analog poly(I,C) also responded with significantly increased HA synthesis (n = 3; p ≤ 0.05). HA was measured in supernatant of cells exposed to the indicated stimuli for 10 h. EBV concentrations (μg/ml) are indicated on the x axes. Shown in Fig. 1C are additional data that resulted from initial experiments exploring time requirements for the activation of HAS genes by EBV. Over the course of such experiments (3 days) in FLS, HAS1 is the only gene that quickly responded to EBV exposure, whereas steady state mRNA levels of HAS2 and HAS3 remained largely unaffected. Steady state mRNA levels for HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 were monitored at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h following exposure of FLS to an initial concentration of 30 μg/ml of active EBV. Double- and Single-stranded Viral RNA Activates HAS and HA Release—The synthetic dsRNA analog poly(I,C) has been used in the past to analyze virus-induced activation and signaling pathways (23Jiang Z. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Nie H. Silva A.M. Williams B.R. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16713-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 24de La Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30747-30755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As shown above, similar to EBV, poly(I,C) induces the release of HA in FLS. Shown in Fig. 2A are data that demonstrate that HAS1 mRNA levels in poly(I,C)-treated FLS are dose-dependently elevated and that low nanogram concentrations of this viral analog are sufficient to significantly increase HAS1 mRNA. Not shown are data that demonstrate that, like in EBV-treated cells, mRNA levels of HAS2 and HAS3 are not significantly affected at the time points measured. For comparison, FLS were also exposed to IL-1β (2.5 ng/ml) and to autologous human RNA used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 2A, lane labeled RNA hum 10 μg). Concentrations of poly(I,C) indicated on the x axis are in nanograms/ml. In Fig. 2A, lane w/o represents data collected from untreated cells. mRNA levels in treated cells were determined after a 12-h exposure. Starting from 20 ng/ml of poly(I,C) mRNA, levels of HAS1 are significantly higher (n = 3; p ≤ 0.05). After confirming that poly(I,C) and EBV act in similar ways regarding HAS activation and HA release, structural requirements of the synthetic viral mRNA analogs were tested. Singlestranded poly(A), poly(I), poly(C), and poly(U) were used to analyze their effectiveness as inducers of HAS1 transcription. Shown in Fig. 2B are data of experiments in which FLS were treated with 10 and 0.6 μg of ssRNA analogs for 8 h. FLS were left untreated (Fig. 2B, lane w/o) or were exposed to poly(C), poly(A), and poly(I). These data indicate that poly(C) is the most potent inducer of HAS1 translation followed by poly(A). Poly(I), however, only activates HAS1 significantly at the very high concentration of 10 μg/ml. The fact that changes in mRNA levels induced by ssRNA translate into changes in HA production/release is shown in Fig. 2C. HA levels in cells treated with poly(C) are significantly higher than in control cells (Fig. 2C, lane w/o) (n = 6; p ≤ 0.05). Levels of HA in the supernatant of poly(A)-treated cells are lower but still significantly higher than HA in untreated cells (n = 6; p = 0.019). The final concentration of each of the compounds used was 5 μg/ml. Culture medium was collected 12 h later; IL-1β (5 ng/ml) was used as a positive control and to provide some measure of comparison (Fig. 2C, lane IL-1). Viral RNA Activates HAS1 through a MAPK p38 and Stressactivated Protein Kinase/JNK-dependent Pathway—Analyzing signaling pathways provides basic information with regard to regulatory mechanisms of a given gene as well as possible targets for future drug intervention. Shown in Fig. 3 are data that demonstrate that blocking the MAPK p38 pathway by chemical means nearly completely prevented poly(I,C)-induced HAS1 mRNA accumulation. Blocking the JNK pathway reduced poly(I,C)-induced HAS1 mRNA by roughly 50%. However, blocking the ERK pathway was without significant effect. In this type of experiment, FLS were preincubated with the indicated MAPK inhibitors for 60 min, afterward poly(I,C) (0.6 μg/ml) was added where indicated. RNA was isolated 8 h afterward. The MAPK p38 and JNK inhibitors were used at 5 μm and the ERK inhibitor at 10 μm, respectively. Double- and Single-stranded RNA Analogs Activate NF-κBin FLS—Activation of NF-κB is a hallmark of many inflammatory processes (15Siebenlist U.S. Brown K. Franzoso G. Bauerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression, Environmental Stresses and Nutrients. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1995: 93-141Google Scholar). Whether and to what degree viral analogs are able to activate nuclear translocation of NF-κB in FLS was tested next. FLS were treated with equal concentrations (2.5 μg/ml) of either double-stranded (poly(I,C)) or single-stranded (poly(I), poly(A), poly(U), poly(C)) viral analogs. Shown in Fig. 4A is one of two EMSA experiments demonstrating well defined differences in the ability of single-stranded polynucleotide to activate NF-κB. Among the polynucleotides used, poly(C) is the most potent inducer of NF-κB activation followed by poly(A). However, effects on NF-κB-DNA complex formation were negligible in poly(U), and especially in poly(I)-treated FLS. Also of interest, treating FLS with the double-stranded poly(I,C) molecule resulted in NF-κB-DNA complexes that were approximately half of protein-DNA complexes formed by cells that were exposed to the single-stranded poly(C) molecule. Such data support the conclusion that only poly(C) accounted for the effects on NF-κB activation in poly(I,C)-treated FLS. Neither exposure to double-stranded nor to single-stranded polynucleotides resulted in changes in protein-DNA binding patterns in EMSA experiments utilizing the consensus CRE or AP-1-binding elements (Fig. 4A). FLS were left untreated (Fig. 4A, lane MED) or treated for 45 min with the indicated substances. IL-1β (5 ng/ml) was included as a positive control. Consensus NF-κB elements were used for EMSA experiments shown in Fig. 4A. That the nuclear extract of poly(I,C)-treated FLS also interacts with the DNA element (CAC GGG GGA ATT TCT CTC TGC), an NF-κB-binding site that can be found in the promoter region of HAS1, is shown in Fig. 4B.As shown in Fig. 4B, left panel, consensus and HAS1-NF-κB elements compete for protein binding in EMSA exp"
https://openalex.org/W2065742675,"Since the opening of Biopolis in 2003, Singapore's 18 acre science complex on a hill has attracted the rest of the world's curiosity. What's going on at Centros, Helios, Nanos, and Genome, to name only four of Biopolis's nine geometrically eye-catching buildings (Figure 1)? They leave the impression of stepping into the future, which is right in sync with a larger plan orchestrated by the industrial engineer Philip Yeo. Yeo, chairman first of the Economic Development Board and later of Singapore's A∗STAR science agency, saw the need to stimulate Singapore's economy, which, by 2001, was experiencing its steepest downturn since its independence, with an ambitious Biomedical Sciences Initiative. If all goes according to plan, between 2000 and 2010, the government will have spent roughly 3.5 billion Singaporean dollars on this initiative, and Biopolis will be but one piece of a 200 hectare biomedical development called “One North.” Stem cell science has always been a major part of this initiative, said Lee Eng Hin, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the National University of Singapore and cochairman of the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium (SSCC). Singapore's affinity with stem cells, after all, “goes way back in time,” Lee observed. In 1993, Ariff Bongso, a Sri Lankan-born fertility specialist working at the university's hospital, had a vision that the magazine Asiaweek described as “a whisper from God” when he grasped the potential medical usefulness of cells from IVF embryos. He went on to isolate them, although he was unable to sustain their growth in vitro beyond two passages. Biopolis, a broad and busy spectrum of largely government-funded stem cell research—everything from ES to adult cells, basic to clinical—is clear indication of a small nation eager to stay at the forefront. Biopolis houses seven research institutes managed by A∗STAR, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, five of which are heavily involved in stem cells: the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), the BioInformatics Institute (BII), the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), the Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI), and the Institute of Medical Biology (IMB). Researchers at the Institute of Bioengineering & Nanotechnology (IBN) also handle stem cells, but to a lesser degree. So far, the only company of the two dozen or so firms located at Biopolis to focus on stem cells is ES Cell International (ESI). “Biopolis constitutes a fantastic research environment,” said ESI's former chief executive Alan Colman. As of July 1, Colman, who is known internationally for helping the Roslin Institute to clone Dolly, moved from Helios to the Proteos building at Biopolis to become the executive director of the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium. “One of the attractive aspects of Biopolis is that it's the way a small island can artificially create critical mass,” he noted. “It takes the view that there's no way it can sustain the number and quality of scientists that you'll find in a Boston, or certain other hot areas in North America. But what you can do is bring everyone together as close as possible so that you can maximize the benefit of your resources.” And vast resources Biopolis does have, particularly in the form of people and funding. There are the many distinguished senior scientists from the stem cell and related fields that Philip Yeo lured from other continents, earning him the moniker of “serial kidnapper.” There is also local talent, like stem cell researcher Huck-Hui Ng, who might have emigrated had Biopolis not been built. The hope is to boost the local pool to 1000 PhDs by 2015 by way of a national science scholarships program that began in 2001. Kidnapped husband-wife teams include David Lane, of p53-gene fame, who directs the IMCB institute and is the new chair of the Biomedical Research Council, and Birgitte Lane, who coordinates the study of epithelial stem cells at IMB; UCSD scientists Edward Holmes and Judith Swain were recruited to guide Biopolis's translational medical research; and Neal Copeland and Nancy Jenkins from the National Cancer Institute. Another NCI scientist enticed to Biopolis, Edison Liu, who oversees GIS, in turn recruited hematologist Bing Lim from Harvard Medical School. Alan Colman came to stay in 2002, when he joined ES Cell International's Singapore office as its first full-time employee. The company, which focuses entirely on human embryonic stem cells, moved to Biopolis a year later. ESI at the time was based in Australia, even though it was a Singapore-registered company. Colman recognized that Singapore, not Australia, presented a brighter future in terms of financing. In Singapore, the attitude toward startups was different, he said. “Yes, there was a desire to make money, but Singapore's decision makers also wanted to increase the sophistication of the work force and bring in people who could mentor the local talent,” he recounted. “This double-objective meant there was going to be more of a secure source of financing, at least in the short term, than in Australia.” ESI moved entirely to Biopolis in 2004. The majority of its financing has come from the Singapore government, directly or indirectly, according to Colman, who remains on the company's board. “We would have been dead in the water in the US or UK, because for a private stem cell company, it's very tough to raise money,” he said. It's hard for a stem cell company to be profitable within the time frame that investors would like to see a return. This is one reason, he said, that ESI is downsizing its R&D in cell therapies for heart disease and diabetes and upsizing “more near-market opportunities,” like making and selling cardiac cells for drug toxicity studies. Funds available for Biopolis researchers flow from primarily two sources. Each research institute has its own budget, its employees essentially paid by A∗STAR. A researcher can also receive funds from the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium, which came into existence in 2005 expressly to coordinate Singapore's stem cell community and nourish it with grant funds. Its support is also government based, because SSCC is under the auspices of the Biomedical Research Council. Last year, SSCC gave out about $10 million in grants, according to Lee. Bing Lim, the Senior Group Leader for the Genome Institute's Stem Cell and Development Biology Group, appreciates the speed of his institute's intramural funding system. “If something is hot, we can make our own internal decisions and fund it straight away,” he described. After a grant proposal is submitted, a meeting of the review committee can be convened in a few days, and, if approved, funding can start almost immediately, he said, whereas “at the NIH, it can take 6–8 months after submitting a grant proposal before you get any funds, if you are successful.” There's a lot about Biopolis's physical location that can encourage collaborations. It has its own academic and corporate epicenter, it is located a few minutes from researchers at the National University and Hospital, and it's smack in the center of one of Asia's most active hubs. “I think the environment is very open for collaborations,” said Ian McNiece, who recently joined the Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami. During the two years he ran Johns Hopkins' research division at Biopolis, “People were very eager to discuss collaborative projects, and we were in the midst of setting some exciting ones up, which added to the disappointment of having to leave.” A∗STAR terminated its relationship with the Hopkins' Singapore division in the summer of 2006, having spent more than $50 million on the venture. It alleged that Hopkins hadn't accomplished certain milestone markers. Others have remarked that Biopolis's collaborations between academics and industry could be stronger and that the A∗STAR institutes act more like corporate silos than the educational entities they strive to be. Because the stem cell work taking place at Biopolis is raw R&D, with no products yet being manufactured, to what extent the A∗STAR institutes can perpetuate entrepreneurial ties, whether with groups close by or far away, remains to be seen. “It's never easy in any environment to develop working relationships either with other companies or other academics,” Colman noted. “There are sensitivities about data, privacy, intellectual property—in any relationship, in any country—and Singapore is no different. Here, because of everyone being close together, it's easier to conceive of and plan for collaborations. But actually getting it all formalized can take longer than you want.” Controls on human embryonic stem cell use are similar to those in the United Kingdom, with stipulations like the 14 day cutoff and no reproductive cloning. There's this difference, however, said Colman: In Singapore, the controls aren't legislated; they are guidelines. “But Singapore has a reputation for authoritarianism, and guidelines have the impact of laws,” he said. The view from outside, that Singapore's regulations are lenient, “is a misconception in my opinion,” says Ian McNiece. In his experience, “a lot of uses of human cells were overregulated compared to regulations in the US,” he said, and gave this example. “To purchase existing human cell lines from ATTC for laboratory studies, you needed formal IRB approval, which isn't done in the States. It wasn't hard to get, but it was time consuming, costly, and bureaucratic.” To move beyond basic research, Biopolis researchers are girding up the staff and infrastructure for translational research. The SSCC, for instance, has given the Bioprocessing Technology Institute the task of building a GMP-grade facility for the expansion of cells for therapies. “We're aiming for the facility to be functional by mid 2008,” said Andre Choo, BTI Senior Scientist in human ES cells. Bing Lim, who began coming over on a part-time basis in 2002 due to Ed Liu's invitation to help launch GIS's stem cell program, now spends most of his time at Biopolis. He feels at home in Singapore, having been born in neighboring Malaysia, plus there are many things about Biopolis that he really likes—the mesh of biology and technology, the highly motivated students he is training, and the collaborative spirit. At Harvard Medical School, “You are one person out of hundreds in an academic center that has achieved its pinnacle,” he remarked. “You feel you wouldn't be missed. In Singapore, you see a country that is striving to build a center of excellence and constantly raising its own bar, and you know your contribution can matter.”"

A central role for industry in the ongoing development of stem cell technologies is useful for both therapeutic applications and the commercialization of technologies that support and drive the research. Appreciating such contributions, the ISSCR appointed an Industry Committee in 2005 to provide international industry representation and perspective to the Society's activities. With the fast-paced progression of the stem cell field, the role of the ISSCR Industry Committee is evolving.

Appreciating such contributions, the ISSCR appointed an Industry Committee in 2005 to provide international industry representation and perspective to the Society's activities. With the fast-paced progression of the stem cell field, the role of the ISSCR Industry Committee is evolving. Industry has been a valuable component in the development of stem cell technologies for more than two decades (Marshak et al., 2001Marshak D.R. Gardner R.L. Gottlieb D. Stem Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). The use of enriched populations of hematopoietic stem cells for transplant was facilitated by the development of devices and reagents for the selection of cells from mobilized peripheral blood, and the clinical use of such cells has become a standard in transplantation (Huntenburg et al., 1998Huntenburg C.C. Kunkel L.A. Schneidkraut M.J. CD34+ cell engraftment, ex vivo expansion, and malignant cell depletion following immunomagnetic selection.J. Hematother. 1998; 7: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The acceptance of mesenchymal stem cells for research and therapeutic uses has similarly been aided by commercial entities (Pittenger et al., 1999Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells.Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17020) Google Scholar). Other somatic tissue stem cells, such as those from adipose tissue (Fraser et al., 2006Fraser J.K. Wulur I. Alfonso Z. Hedrick M.H. Fat tissue: an underappreciated source of stem cells for biotechnology.Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 150-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), have been transitioned from academic discovery to commercial organizations. Research involving embryonic stem (ES) cells has been influenced by industry participation quite directly. For example, because of the limitations on United States government funding for human ES cell (hESC) research, Geron Corporation was an important supporter of the research that led to the isolation of hESC clones by James Thomson and his colleagues (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts.Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11507) Google Scholar). Industry sources, along with private foundations, have continued to be vital to the development of hESC research efforts. In addition to new cell lines, industry has commercialized the media, supplements, and substrates for growing ES cells, which has enabled many investigators to enter the field. Outside the United States, hESC research has expanded rapidly alongside other stem cell research, in part due to less restrictive government regulations. The United Kingdom, as one example, has seen the development of several large centers of stem cell research, which have spawned a significant number of companies associated with commercializing the ensuing technology. Public funding of stem cell research in the United Kingdom has enabled such links; for example, the Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council funds programs at the Roslin Institute that have contributed enormously to commercial progress in animal stem cells. Australia, Singapore, and South Korea are among other countries notable in funding stem cell research. The therapeutic, diagnostic, research, and screening utility of stem cells has prompted many to imagine and to realize products and product concepts for commercialization. Such opportunities have attracted investment from both the public and private equity markets. This has infused a large amount of resources into companies, which fund internal research and development as well as provide sponsorship for academic collaborators. In this way, industry has participated in financing the efforts for basic and applied research on stem cells, much in the same way the industry has been involved in the development of other biological technologies, such as recombinant therapeutic protein production, therapeutic antibodies, gene therapy, and cell therapy. Stem cell technology differs from other technologies in that it is proving fundamental to a variety of therapeutic and diagnostic arenas, including the following: multiple disease areas (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, diabetes and metabolic disorders, autoimmune disease, orthopaedic disorders); various delivery systems (e.g., cell therapy, medical devices, transplantation); and many uses in screening (e.g., toxicology, efficacy of chemicals or biologics). In short, questions about stem cells underlie many fundamental questions of biology and therefore touch all medical and biological research. The ISSCR leadership recognizes the key contributions and ongoing participation of industry in stem cell research and the value for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic applications in drawing together basic, clinical, and industrial research arms. In 2005 the ISSCR leadership conceived of an Industry Committee to provide counsel on the commercial sector. I was invited to serve as the first chairman of the Industry Committee, and with the ISSCR leadership recruited representatives from commercial organizations involved in therapeutics, diagnostics, research tools, manufacturing, and venture capital. We also attempted to draw in committee members representing each major geographical region of the world in which extensive stem cell research is conducted in an industrial setting. These included North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. All of the committee members had both technical scientific background and significant industrial experience and position. The committee was not intended to be a marketing or fundraising organization, and committee participation was not linked to sponsorship of the Society. This status permitted the committee members to address questions and issues fundamental to the relationship between the academic and industrial members of ISSCR without a specific corporate agenda, but with an altruistic and sincere interest in stem cell research. Initially, the committee met quarterly to discuss how issues in stem cell research affecting industry might be addressed in the ISSCR. A key forum for dialogue in the ISSCR is the annual meeting, and the Industry Committee recommended to the Program Committee a variety of qualified speaker candidates from the ranks of researchers in industry to be considered for podium presentations at the annual meetings. In addition to these candidates the committee suggested several session topics on technologies related to industry, intended to complement the academic program. Examples of suggested sessions included such subjects as Culture Media, Process Development, Cell Manufacturing, Regulatory Affairs, and Clinical Trial Design, as related to cell-based therapy. Further, the committee supported increased reporting on clinical progress in cellular therapies. To this end, the committee has seen only limited success. To a large extent, this is due to the fact that the stem cell therapy field is still early in its development, and the ISSCR has focused on the underlying scientific issues surrounding stem cells rather than their applications. As the stem cell field matures, the industry-related topics will have increasing relevance to the ISSCR membership. During 2007, the Industry Committee provided guidance to other committees of the ISSCR, notably the Standards Committee. Members of the industrial community have a significant stake in understanding and commenting on standards that may be set by the community of scientists in the stem cell field. Criteria for cell identity and purity, for example, are important to determine for cellular products. In the laboratory, determining what standard preparations will be acceptable to the academic community is a key to supplying scientists with useful products, which in turn is a key to operating a successful business in research tools. In the clinic, demonstrating safety and efficacy of preparations for therapeutic use is essential to obtaining regulatory approval of cellular products. Criteria for cellular preparations used in academic research and those used in clinical products might be very different. Further, large-scale manufacturing of therapeutic products may demand quite different technology than laboratory-scale research preparation. Thus, industry members can contribute significant information and a critical perspective into the mix of factors under consideration for assigning standards in stem cell research. From an administrative point of view, the Industry Committee has offered several useful ideas to the ISSCR membership. Employment is an important concern for many students and young investigators in the field, and the committee held “Meet the Experts” sessions in which members can learn about employment opportunities in industry. In the future, ISSCR may be able to mount a full employment matching program to align scientists with job interviews during the annual conference. The representation of industry at future annual meetings of the ISSCR will include an Industry Symposium Program prior to the start of the conference. This model was recommended by several Industry Committee members, based on good experiences with such sessions at the American Society of Hematology annual meetings. For 2008, the program will be held on the Wednesday morning (June 11) preceding the ISSCR annual meeting (June 11–14) in Philadelphia. As the stem cell field and the ISSCR have grown, so has the Industry Committee matured and evolved in thinking about and participating in the activities of the Society. Ultimately, I advocate the goal of moving away from an Industry Committee entirely. Instead I recommend that members of the industrial scientific community be incorporated as full members of other committees. Rather than isolating industry as a separate entity, allowing industry participation in all of the functions of the ISSCR can only add depth and needed perspective to the group, forging useful scientific alloys that are stronger and more useful than the base metals from which they rise."
