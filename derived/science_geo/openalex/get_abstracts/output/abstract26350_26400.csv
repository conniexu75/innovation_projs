https://openalex.org/W2061805562,"Although bladder cancers are very common, little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. In this study, invasive bladder cancers were evaluated for the presence of gene mutations in the p53 suppressor gene. Of 18 tumors evaluated, 11 (61 percent) were found to have genetic alterations of p53. The alterations included ten point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, and one 24-base pair deletion. In all but one case, the mutations were associated with chromosome 17p allelic deletions, leaving the cells with only mutant forms of the p53 gene product. Through the use of the polymerase chain reaction and oligomer-specific hybridization, p53 mutations were identified in 1 to 7 percent of the cells within the urine sediment of each of three patients tested. The p53 mutations are the first genetic alterations demonstrated to occur in a high proportion of primary invasive bladder cancers. Detection of such mutations ex vivo has clinical implications for monitoring individuals whose tumor cells are shed extracorporeally."
https://openalex.org/W1993274596,"In Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the genes that govern synthesis of the polyketide portion of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin are organized in six repeated units that encode fatty acid synthase (FAS)-like activities. Each repeated unit is designated a module, and two modules are contained in a single open reading frame. A model for the synthesis of this complex polyketide is proposed, where each module encodes a functional synthase unit and each synthase unit participates specifically in one of the six FAS-like elongation steps required for formation of the polyketide. In addition, genetic organization and biochemical order of events appear to be colinear. Evidence for the model is provided by construction of a selected mutant and by isolation of a polyketide of predicted structure."
https://openalex.org/W2119628780,"Evolutionary conservation of members of the NGF family in vertebrates was studied by DNA sequence analysis of PCR fragments for NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 from human, rat, chicken, viper, Xenopus, salmon, and ray. The results showed that the three factors are highly conserved from fishes to mammals. Phylogenetic trees reflecting the evolution and speciation of the members of the NGF family were constructed. In addition, the gene for a fourth member of the family, neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), was isolated from Xenopus and viper. The NT-4 gene encodes a precursor protein of 236 amino acids, which is processed into a 123 amino acid mature NT-4 protein with 50%-60% amino acid identity to NGF, BDNF, and NT-3. The NT-4 protein was shown to interact with the low affinity NGF receptor and elicited neurite outgrowth from explanted dorsal root ganglia with no and lower activity in sympathetic and nodose ganglia, respectively. Northern blot analysis of different tissues from Xenopus showed NT-4 mRNA only in ovary, where it was present at levels over 100-fold higher than those of NGF mRNA in heart."
https://openalex.org/W2043582941,"Immunochemistry has historically focused on the nature of antigenicity and antibody-antigen recognition. However, in the last 5 years, the field of immunochemistry has taken a new direction. With the aid of mechanistic and synthetic chemistry, the vast network of molecules and cells of the immune system has been tapped to produce antibodies with a new function--catalytic antibodies. Because antibodies can be generated that selectively bind almost any molecule of interest, this new technology offers the potential to tailor-make highly selective catalysts for applications in biology, chemistry, and medicine. In addition, catalytic antibodies provide fundamental insight into important aspects of biological catalysis, including the importance of transition-state stabilization, proximity effects, general acid and base catalysts, electrophilic and nucleophilic catalysis, and strain."

https://openalex.org/W2088904620,"We have used PCR to identify 13 novel protein-tyrosine kinase genes (tyro-1 to -13), six of which (tyro-1 to -6) are preferentially expressed in the developing vertebrate nervous system. The tyro-2 and tyro-9 genes encode kinase domains that exhibit strong amino acid sequence similarity to the equivalent regions of the receptors for EGF and FGF, respectively, and may encode novel receptors for these or related polypeptide ligands. The tyro-1 to -6 genes are all expressed during central nervous system neurogenesis and exhibit distinct and highly regionalized patterns of expression in the adult brain. Together with recent studies in invertebrates, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that protein-tyrosine kinases play a central role in neural development."
https://openalex.org/W1583253515,"A complementary DNA that encodes a bovine brain, calmodulin-sensitive (type I) adenylylcyclase has been inserted into the baculovirus genome under the control of the strong polyhedron promoter. Expression of the recombinant adenylylcyclase in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus increases adenylylcyclase activity in cell membranes to 10-20 nmol.min-1.mg-1 (approximately 0.1% of membrane protein). The catalytic activity of the recombinant adenylylcyclase can be stimulated by Gs alpha, calmodulin, or forskolin, and it can be inhibited by adenosine analogs and by G protein beta gamma subunit. The specific activity of the purified recombinant protein approximates 5 mumol.min-1.mg-1. This is similar to that of the enzyme purified from bovine brain. Type I adenylylcyclase has a quasiduplicated structure. There are two membrane-spanning domains, each with six putative transmembrane helices, and there are two presumed nucleotide-binding domains that are about 55% similar to each other. No catalytic activity is detectable when each half of the adenylylcyclase molecule is expressed by itself. However, coexpression of the two halves results in considerable enzymatic activity. Interaction between the two halves of adenylylcyclase may be necessary for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1555033960,"Recent data suggest that uric acid is generated locally in the vessel wall by the action of xanthine oxidase. This enzyme, activated during ischemia/reperfusion by proteolytic conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase, catalyzes the oxidation of xanthine, thereby generating free radicals and uric acid. Because of the potential role of ischemia/reperfusion in vascular disease, we studied the effects of uric acid on rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. Uric acid stimulated VSMC DNA synthesis, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal activity at 150 microM. Maximal induction of DNA synthesis by uric acid (250 microM) was approximately 70% of 10% calf serum and equal to 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) AB or 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor. Neither uric acid precursors (xanthine and hypoxanthine) nor antioxidants (ascorbic acid, glutathione, and alpha-tocopherol) were mitogenic for VSMC. Uric acid was mitogenic for VSMC but not for fibroblasts or renal epithelial cells. The time course for uric acid stimulation of VSMC growth was slower than serum, suggesting induction of an autocrine growth mechanism. Exposure of quiescent VSMC to uric acid stimulated accumulation of PDGF A-chain mRNA (greater than 5-fold at 8 h) and secretion of PDGF-like material in conditioned medium (greater than 10-fold at 24 h). Uric acid-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation was markedly inhibited by incubation with anti-PDGF A-chain polyclonal antibodies. Thus uric acid stimulates VSMC growth via an autocrine mechanism involving PDGF A-chain. These findings suggest that generation of uric acid during ischemia/reperfusion contributes to atherogenesis and intimal proliferation following arterial injury."
https://openalex.org/W1525740558,"The catabolism of aggrecan has been studied in calf articular cartilage explant cultures. The chondroitin sulfate-rich, high buoyant density products that accumulate in culture medium have been purified, and NH2-terminal sequence data have been obtained. Aggrecan released from the tissue in the presence or absence of interleukin-1 alpha, whether analyzed before or after reduction and alkylation, exhibited only one major and one minor NH2-terminal sequence. The major sequence, ARGXVILXAKPDF, shows very high similarity to a region of the interglobular domain (between the G1 and G2 domains) of both human and rat aggrecan. The minor sequence, VEVS, was that previously described for the NH2 terminus of the intact core protein. These results indicate that catabolism of aggrecan in cartilage explants involves proteolytic cleavage within a conserved region of the interglobular domain and that this results in the separation of the G1 domain from the remainder of the molecule. A major product of this process is a large nonaggregating species that consists of an NH2-terminal sequence beginning with ARG (and composed of about 100 residues of the interglobular domain) that is attached to an intact G2 domain followed by an extended section of the chondroitin sulfate-bearing domain toward the COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2092910281,"When CNS precursor cells purified from the external germinal layer of the early postnatal mouse cerebellum are cultured in cellular reaggregates, DNA synthesis increased 10-fold above that of cells dispersed in a monolayer or embedded in a collagen matrix. Dividing precursor cells gave rise to neurons immunopositive for the neural antigens N-CAM, L1, and TAG-1, but not to astroglial cells immunopositive for glial filament protein. Moreover, proliferating precursor cells did not generate other types of cerebellar neurons, as judged by the lack of expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase, the synthetic enzyme for gamma-amino-n-butyric acid. By contrast, the addition of astroglial cells, or astroglial cell membranes, to cellular reaggregates of granule cell neuroblasts arrested precursor cell DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that homotypic contact interactions among CNS neural progenitors control precursor cell proliferation and fate in generative zones of developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W2060655209,"Diabetic complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy, and renal and cardiovascular disease continue to pose major health risks for diabetic patients. Consequently, much effort has focused on approaches that could replace conventional insulin therapy and provide more precise regulation of blood glucose levels. The biohybrid perfused artificial pancreas was designed to incorporate islet tissue and a selectively permeable membrane that isolates this tissue from the immune system of the recipient. Biohybrid pancreas devices containing canine islet allografts were implanted in ten pancreatectomized dogs requiring 18 to 32 units of injected insulin daily. These implants resulted in good control of fasting glucose levels in six of these animals without further exogenous insulin for periods of up to 5 months."

https://openalex.org/W1597721077,"Both mu- and m-calpain (the micro- and millimolar Ca(2+)-requiring Ca(2+)-dependent proteinases) can completely remove Z-disks from skeletal muscle myofibrils and leave a space devoid of filaments in the Z-disk area. alpha-Actinin, a principal protein component of Z-disks, is removed from myofibrils by the calpains, and a 100-kDa polypeptide that comigrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the alpha-actinin subunit is released into the supernatant. Purified calpain does not degrade purified actin or purified alpha-actinin as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by N- and C-terminal amino acid analysis of calpain-treated and untreated alpha-actinin and actin. The 100-kDa polypeptide released from myofibrils by calpain elutes identically with native alpha-actinin off DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite columns and, after purification, binds to pure F-actin in the same manner that untreated, native alpha-actinin binds. Calpain-released alpha-actinin also accelerates the rate of superprecipitation of reconstituted actomyosin, a sensitive property characteristic of native alpha-actinin. Consequently, the calpains release alpha-actinin from the Z-disk of myofibrils without degrading it or without altering its ability to bind to actin. These results indicate that alpha-actinin does not simply cross-link thin filaments across the Z-disk but that at least one additional protein (or perhaps an altered actin or alpha-actinin) is involved in the alpha-actinin/actin interaction in Z-disks."
https://openalex.org/W1581371654,"The complete nucleotide sequence encoding a Schistosoma mansoni protein termed Sm14 was determined from cDNA clones propagated in bacteriophage lambda gt11 in Escherichia coli. The 14.8-kDa protein bears significant homologies with a family of related polypeptides which bind hydrophobic ligands. Members of this group of cytosolic proteins were originally identified based on their affinity for long chain fatty acids. The purified recombinant protein exhibited an affinity to fatty acids, in contrast to a mutant lacking 16 N-terminal amino acids. Immunofluorescence experiments show that tubercles, which are structures located on the dorsal surface of adult male schistosome and known to contain lipids, are stained using antibodies raised to the beta-galactosidase fusion protein. A regular staining pattern is also evident in the muscle layers as well as in the body of the parasite. As the schistosome cannot synthesize fatty acids de novo and is dependent on the uptake of lipids from serum, the available data support a role for Sm14 in the transport of fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2068210357,"Fatal neonatal sibling aggression is common in predatory birds but has not been previously reported in wild mammals. Spotted hyena females are strongly masculinized, both anatomically and behaviorally, apparently by high levels of androgens during ontogeny. Neonates display elevated androgen levels, precocial motor development, and fully erupted front teeth. Litters are usually twins, and siblings fight violently at birth, apparently leading to the death of one sibling in same-sex litters, whereas in mixed-sex litters both siblings usually survive."

https://openalex.org/W2162468227,"Abstract Pyruvate kinase is a major regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. Transcription of the L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene in rat liver is induced by feeding a carbohydrate-rich diet. To investigate the regulatory DNA sequences required for this response, primary hepatocytes were transfected with plasmids containing the 5'-flanking sequence of the rat L-PK gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Sequences from -4300 to +12 of the L-PK gene directed an increase in CAT activity when hepatocytes were switched from media containing 10 mM lactate to 25 mM glucose. Average induction was 17-fold (n = 13; S.E. = 2.9). Addition of fructose to the media also induced CAT activity. Carbohydrate regulation of the L-PK promoter was retained with 5'-deletions to -197, but constructs deleted to -96 were completely unresponsive. The 101-base pair fragment from -197 to -96 of the L-PK gene can confer carbohydrate regulation when fused in either orientation to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter, thus defining a carbohydrate response element in this region. Expression of the transfected gene was regulated by insulin and glucagon in a pattern similar to that seen for the endogenous L-PK gene, suggesting that control of L-PK promoter activity was responsible for carbohydrate-mediated changes in L-PK mRNA production."
https://openalex.org/W1543047110,"4-Coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), a key enzyme of phenylpropanoid metabolism in plants, is encoded in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) by two structurally similar genes (St4cl-1, St4cl-2). Computer-based sequence analyses revealed similarities at the amino acid sequence level with other enzymes dependent on ATP for activation of aromatic carboxylic acids, e.g. some bacterial peptide synthetases. All these enzymes have a common seven amino acid sequence motif containing one cysteine residue. Using an assay on the basis of the polymerase chain reaction, we show that the mRNAs from both 4CL genes accumulate to equal levels in suspension-cultured cells and whole plant tissues, independent of various kinds of activating stimulus applied and of the overall transcriptional activity of the genes. The apparent lack of differential expression, together with the fact that both 4CL genes and proteins are nearly identical in structure, make it unlikely that 4CL isoforms in potato have specific roles in metabolic channeling. Constitutive in vivo footprints in the TATA-box proximal region of the St4cl-1 promoter define putative cis-acting elements which may be involved in the responses of the 4CL genes to various endogenous and exogenous stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1530975353,"To investigate the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of the human apolipoprotein (apo) E/C-I gene locus, human apoE and apoC-I gene constructs containing various lengths of the 5'-flanking or 3'-flanking region were used to create transgenic mice. Several essential tissue-specific regulatory elements were identified in the region between the apoE and the apoC-I genes, as well as in a distal domain found downstream of the apoC-I gene. Most notably, transcription of both the apoE and apoC-I genes in the liver, their major site of expression, required downstream regulatory elements, possibly located within a common regulatory domain more than 2 kilobases 3' of the apoC-I gene (about 14 kilobases downstream of the apoE gene promoter). In the region between the apoE and apoC-I genes, a single strong positive element directed apoE and apoC-I gene expression in the skin. The intergenic region also contained elements that stimulated apoE gene expression in the brain and silenced apoE gene expression only in the kidney. These results demonstrate that multiple independent regulatory elements control expression of the human apoE/C-I gene locus in various tissues. Transgenic mice expressing human apoC-I in the liver exhibited plasma triglyceride levels that were 2-3-fold higher than those in control mice, an effect not found when transgenic human apoE was produced. This result suggests that apoC-I may modulate the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1529444545,"We have utilized site-directed mutants to study the role of autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in the regulation of receptor kinase activity and ligand-induced endocytosis. A single mutation of the major autophosphorylation site, Y1173, and a double mutation of two autophosphorylation sites, Y1173 and Y1148, did not inhibit kinase activity in vivo, using PLC gamma 1 as a specific substrate for the EGF receptor kinase. The simultaneous mutation of three major autophosphorylation sites (Y1173, Y1148, Y1068), however, caused more than a 50% decrease in EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1. The triple mutation also resulted in a substantial inhibition of the EGF-receptor endocytic system. We have used three types of experiments to analyze internalization, recycling, and degradation of EGF in cells with these mutants or the wild-type receptor. Using a simple mathematical model we have shown that the internalization rate constant is 2-fold lower in cells expressing the triple mutation receptor (F3 cells) than in cells expressing wild-type EGF receptor (wild-type cells). However, the rate constant for recycling was similar in both cell types. The EGF degradation rate constant was also lower in F3 cells. EGF-induced EGF receptor degradation was slower in F3 cells (t1/2 = 4 h) than in wild-type cells (t1/2 = 1 h). Therefore, our results suggest that multiple autophosphorylations of the carboxyl terminus of the EGF receptor are required for EGF receptor kinase activation, and for the internalization and intracellular processing of the EGF.receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1600330543,"A cytochrome P-450 that catalyzes the 24-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (P-450cc24: P-450cholecalciferol24) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the kidney mitochondria of female rats treated with vitamin D3 (Ohyama, Y., Hayashi, S., and Okuda, K. (1989) FEBS Lett. 255, 405-408). The molecular weight was 53,000, and its absorption spectrum showed peaks characteristic of cytochrome P-450. The turnover number was 22 min-1 and the specific content was 2.8 nmol/mg protein. The N-terminal amino acid sequence, Arg-Ala-Pro-Lys-Glu-Val-Pro-Leu-, is different from the N-terminal sequence of any other cytochrome P-450s so far reported. Upon reconstitution with the electron-transferring system of the adrenal mitochondria, the enzyme showed a high activity in hydroxylating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 as well as 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at position 24. However, the purified enzyme hydroxylated neither vitamin D3 nor 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3. The enzyme was also inactive toward xenobiotics. The enzyme hydroxylated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 at position 24 but not at 1 alpha, indicating that the enzyme is distinct from that catalyzing 1 alpha-hydroxylation. The reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the Km value for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 2.8 microM. Both vitamin D3 and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 inhibited the 24-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in a competitive, concentration-dependent manner. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase activity was significantly inhibited by 7,8-benzoflavone, ketoconazole, and CO, whereas it was only slightly inhibited by aminoglutethimide, metyrapone, and SKF-525A. Mouse antibodies raised against the cytochrome P-450 inhibited the reaction about 70% and reacted with the P-450cc24 in immunoblotting but did not react with other kinds of cytochrome P-450 in rat liver microsomes and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1574457161,"The C terminus of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) contains three tyrosines (Y1068, Y1148, and Y1173) which correspond to the major autophosphorylation sites. To investigate the role of the tyrosines in internalization and down-regulation of the EGF-R, mutational analysis was performed with receptors in which 1, 2, or all 3 tyrosines were changed to phenylalanines. The triple point mutant EGF-R, expressed in NIH-3T3, exhibited low autophosphorylation in vivo, low biological and reduced kinase activities. Single and double point mutants were down-regulated, as well as wild type EGF-R in response to EGF showing a half-life of about 1 h. Degradation of the triple point mutant, however, was impaired and resulted in a half-life of 4 h in the presence of EGF. EGF-dependent down-regulation of surface receptors was decreased in the triple point mutant EGF-R as was internalization and degradation of EGF. The specific rate of internalization of the triple point mutant was reduced. By contrast, intracellular processing of ligand previously internalized at 20 degrees C was similar between wild type and mutant receptors. Taken together the data indicate that the delay in degradation observed in cells expressing the triple point mutant EGF-R can be attributed mainly to a slower removal from the cell surface. Our results show that in the full-length EGF-R all three C-terminal tyrosines are necessary for rapid internalization, suggesting that autophosphorylation is required for efficient EGF-dependent receptor endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1497463504,"The anthranilate synthase-phosphoribosyl transferase complex, a heterotetrameric enzyme made up of the TrpE and TrpD polypeptides, catalyzes three reactions comprising the first two steps of tryptophan biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium. All three activities of the complex are subject to feedback inhibition by tryptophan, which results from allosteric effects associated with the binding of one molecule of inhibitor to each of the TrpE subunits of the complex. Random in vitro chemical mutagenesis of the trpE gene was used to generate a collection of mutant forms of the complex which displayed varying degrees of resistance to feedback inhibition. Single amino acid substitutions, identified by DNA sequencing, were found at 14 different residues within the TrpE polypeptide. The residues were distributed throughout TrpE, but those that appeared to be most critical for regulation were found in two clusters, one at the extreme amino-terminal end, including residues Glu-39, Ser-40, and Ala-41, and the other in the middle of the polypeptide, including residues Asn-288, Pro-289, Met-293, Phe-294, and Gly-305. Kinetic and binding studies of the purified mutant complexes demonstrated that 9 of the 14 had a marked decrease in affinity for tryptophan with little or no change in substrate affinity or catalytic capacity. The remaining five enzymes exhibited more subtle changes, having small decreases in inhibitor affinity coupled with small increases in substrate affinity. Mutant enzymes that were not totally feed-back-resistant had a decreased kinetic response to tryptophan binding. All enzymes exhibited alterations in tryptophan-induced conformational changes as monitored by dye-ligand chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1598278338,"Increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] caused by receptor activation are thought to stimulate the redistribution of loosely associated protein kinase C (PKC) to a tightly membrane-bound form that is activated by diacylglycerol. The precise role of Ca2(+)-dependent redistribution of PKC in the activation of this enzyme has not been critically assessed. We examined the relationship between PKC redistribution and substrate phosphorylation by comparing the kinetics and the Ca2+ dependence of the two events. Using immunoblotting with specific PKC antibodies, we find that 1321N1 cells express the alpha form of PKC, approximately 10-20% of which is membrane-associated in unstimulated cells. This fraction is increased to 60% in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation. Agonist-induced redistribution of PKC is rapid and transient, peaking at 30 s and returning to control levels by 2-5 min. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors also rapidly increases phosphorylation of both an endogenous 80-kDa protein and the peptide substrate, VRKRTLRRL. However, unlike the time course of PKC redistribution, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of these substrates is sustained for up to 30 min. To compare the Ca2+ dependence of PKC redistribution and substrate phosphorylation, we buffered muscarinic receptor-induced increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] with the divalent cation chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Under these conditions, redistribution of PKC and phosphorylation of the exogenous peptide substrate are inhibited by about 80%. In contrast, muscarinic receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein occurs even when increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] are prevented. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the redistribution of PKC does not correlate in extent or duration with phosphorylation of PKC substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1516634753,"Poly(A) polymerase was purified 22,000-fold to homogeneity from a whole cell extract of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a yield of 22%. The enzyme is a monomeric polypeptide with a denatured molecular weight of 63,000. Incorporation of labeled ATP into acid-precipitable material by the purified enzyme proceeds faster with manganese than with magnesium ions. Various RNA homopolymers as well as Escherichia coli tRNA or rRNA can serve as primers. An RNA that terminates at the natural poly(A) site of the CYC1 gene is not more efficiently elongated than several nonspecific substrates, indicating the requirement for additional factors to provide specificity. Elongation of the primer is distributive. Covering of a poly(A) primer with poly(A)-binding protein reduces the enzyme's activity more than 10-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1991366595,"Extracellular application of ATP, a substance co-stored and co-released with acetylcholine in peripheral nervous systems, potentiates the spontaneous secretion of acetylcholine at developing neuromuscular synapses in Xenopus cell culture, as shown by a marked increase in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents recorded in the postsynaptic muscle cell. The effect of ATP is apparently mediated by the activation of cytosolic protein kinases and requires the influx of Ca2+ through the plasma membrane. Since spontaneous acetylcholine release is known to regulate the development of contractile properties of the postsynaptic muscle cell, extracellular ATP may serve as a positive trophic factor at developing neuromuscular synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2007317681,"We examined the arrangement and development of identified neurons in zebrafish embryos homozygous for the mutation spt-1, which acts autonomously and specifically to alter the development of precursors of trunk segmented mesoderm, resulting in muscle-deficient myotomes. We found that the mutation alters the morphology, number, and arrangement of identified motoneurons. By transplanting identified motoneurons between wild-type and mutant embryos, we found that the effect of the mutation was nonautonomous. We suggest that the segmental arrangement and proper axonal development of motoneurons may result from interactions with segmented mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W1606832165,"cDNA clones encoding four rat tropomyosin isoforms, termed TM-2, TM-3, TM-5a, and TM-5b, were isolated and characterized. All are derived from the alpha-tropomyosin gene via alternative RNA processing and the use of two alternate promoters. The cDNA sequences predict that TM-2 and TM-3 both contain 284 amino acids and differ from each other only at an internal region of the protein from amino acids 189 through 213, due to alternative splicing of exons 6a and 6b. TM-5a and TM-5b both contain 248 amino acids and differ from each other only at an internal exon encoding amino acids 153 through 177, also due to alternative splicing of exons 6a and 6b. The differences in the amino acid sequence encoded by these alternate exons affects the theoretical actin-binding pattern of the tropomyosins, such that TM-5b is expected to bind actin with greater affinity than TM-5a. TM-2 and TM-3 are transcribed from the upstream promoter, and TM-5a and TM-5b are transcribed from an internal promoter. In addition, all four isoforms contain the identical COOH-terminal coding region. RNA protection analyses revealed that the mRNA for each isoform is expressed in a number of different tissues and cell types, although the expression of some isoforms is restricted to particular cell types. Furthermore, the expression of mRNA encoding these isoforms was found to be altered in a number of different virally transformed cell lines. The changes in the expression of tropomyosin mRNAs in transformed cells reflect changes in the relative use of the two promoters, as well as the relative use of alternatively spliced exons 6a and 6b."
https://openalex.org/W1546504982,"Adhesive interactions are important modulators of cellular phenotype. Previously, we demonstrated that quiescent, suspension-arrested cells are not equivalent to density-arrested cells in their patterns of gene expression (Dhawan, J., and Farmer, S.R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9015-9021). In particular, pro-alpha 1(I) collagen expression depended strongly on the extent of cell adhesion. In this paper, we demonstrate that the adhesion-induced rise in collagen gene expression is due to regulation at multiple levels. Steady state levels of pro-alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA increased up to 10-fold by 6 h after replating suspended cells, and this rise is blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis. Transcription of the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene was measured by run-on assay as well as by activation of a rat alpha 1(I) promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct. Both assays reveal a 5-fold depression of pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene transcription in suspended cells. Reattachment of suspended cells resulted in the activation of alpha 1(I) gene transcription by 2-h postreplating, reaching a 3-5-fold level of induction by 18 h. The pro-alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA was substantially more labile in suspended cells than in adherent cells (t1/2 values of approximately 2 h in nonadherent cells and greater than 8 h in exponentially growing or density-arrested cells). Furthermore, reattachment of suspended cells for 18 h resulted in a stabilization of collagen mRNA. We conclude that cell adhesion regulates pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene expression selectively and at transcriptional and posttranscriptional sites."
https://openalex.org/W1484817325,"Glycolipid extracts from various human cancer tissues and cell lines showed the presence of a slow-migrating glycolipid component which was strongly reactive with monoclonal antibody (mAb) NCC-ST-421 (raised against human gastric adenocarcinoma) and weakly cross-reactive with anti-Lea mAbs. The slow-migrating glycolipid was isolated from human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Colo205 grown in nude mice, and was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography. Its structure was elucidated by sequential enzymatic degradation and thin-layer chromatography immunostaining of the degradation products with various mAbs, 1H NMR spectroscopy, positive-ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and methylation analysis. The major slow-migrating component reacting with mAb ST-421 was identified as dimeric Lea, with the structure as follows. [formula: see text] Antigens containing this structure and various analogous structures (including enzymatically synthesized Lea/Lex hybrid antigen) were tested with ST-421. While the mAb was equally reactive with dimeric Lea and Lea/Lex, only the former was chemically detectable as the slow-migrating glycolipid from the tumor extract. ST-421 showed less reactivity with simple Lea (III4FucLc4) or extended Lea (V4FucLc6, and/or IV3Gal beta 1----3[Fuc alpha 1----4]GlcNAcnLc4), and was not reactive with Lex/Lex (dimeric Lex). It was concluded, therefore, that the major tumor-associated slow-migrating glycolipid reacting with ST-421 has the dimeric Lea structure shown above. Since extension of lacto-series structure has been shown to be limited to type 2 chain in normal cells and tissues, extended elongation of type 1 chain as shown in this structure represents a novel tumor-associated epitope."
https://openalex.org/W1558566725,"Proteolytic processing enzymes are required to convert the enkephalin precursor to active opioid peptides. In this study, a novel 33-kDa thiol protease that cleaves complete precursor in the form of [35S]methionine preproenkephalin was purified from bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules. Chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200, chromatofocusing, and chromatography on thiopropyl-Sepharose resulted in an 88,000-fold purification with a recovery of 35% of enzyme activity. The thiol protease is a glycoprotein with a pI of 6.0. It cleaves [35S]methionine preproenkephalin with a pH optimum of 5.5, indicating that it is functional at the intragranular pH of 5.5-6.0. Interestingly, production of trichloroacetic acid-soluble products was optimal at pH 4.0, suggesting that processing of initial precursor and intermediates may require slightly different pH conditions. The protease requires dithiothreitol for activity and is inhibited by the thiol protease inhibitors iodoacetate, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, mercuric chloride, and cystatin. These properties distinguish it from other thiol proteases (cathepsins B, H, L, N, and S), indicating that a unique thiol protease has been identified. The enzyme converted [35S]cysteine preproenkephalin (possessing [35S]cysteine residues specifically within the precursor's NH2-terminal segment) to 22.1-, 21.6-, 17.7-, 17.3-, and 15.0-kDa intermediates that contain the precursor's NH2-terminal segment; proenkephalin in vivo is converted to similar intermediates. The enzyme cleaves peptide F at Lys-Arg and Lys-Lys dibasic amino acid sites to generate methionine enkephalin and intermediates. The appropriate vesicular localization, pH optimum, proteolytic products, and cleavage site specificity suggest that this thiol protease may be involved in enkephalin precursor processing. Most interestingly, [35S]methionine beta-preprotachykinin, a precursor of substance P, is minimally cleaved, suggesting that the thiol protease may possess some selectivity for the enkephalin precursor."

https://openalex.org/W2142417142,"We cloned a cDNA for Mirabilis antiviral protein (MAP), a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), which inhibits the mechanical transmission of plant virus and the in vitro protein synthesis of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The cDNA consisted of 1066 nucleotides and could encode 278 amino acids. The major part of the amino acid sequence (from Ala29 to Ser278) was identical with the sequence of native MAP as determined by protein sequencing. An NH2-terminal extrapeptide (28 amino acid residues) of MAP was comparable with the signal peptides of plant proteins accumulating in the vacuole. A stable hairpin structure was predicted in the 3'-noncoding region of the cDNA. Tandem repeated sequences were found downstream from the hairpin structure. They were composed of triple complete repeats of a heptanucleotide with preceding and following hexa-nucleotide repeats. The cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli based on the T7 expression system. The product encoded by the cDNA was confirmed to be MAP precursor by Western blotting followed by immunological analysis. The growth of the transformants was inhibited by the expression of the gene. MAP precursor also seemed to inhibit the protein synthesis of E. coli just as native MAP has been observed to do."
https://openalex.org/W1526730706,"We recently reported the isolation and sequencing of human cDNA clones corresponding to the alpha 3 chain of type VI collagen (Chu, M.-L., Zhang, R.-Z., Pan, T.-c., Stokes, D., Conway, D., Kuo, H.-J., Glanville, R., Mayer, U., Mann, K., Deutzmann, R., and Timpl, R. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 385-393). The study indicates that the amino-terminal globular domain of the alpha 3(VI) chain consists of nine repetitive subdomains of approximately 200 amino acid residues (N1-N9) and the gene appeared to undergo alternative splicing since some clones lacked regions encoding the N9 and part of the N3 subdomains. In the present study, we report the exon structure for the region encoding the amino-terminal globular domain of the human alpha 3(VI) chain. The nine repetitive subdomains are encoded by 10 exons spanning 26 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA. Eight of the repetitive subdomains (N2-N9) were found to be encoded by separate exons of approximately 600 base pairs each. The only exception is the N1 subdomain which is encoded by two exons of 417 and 146 base pairs. Characterization of the exon/intron structure showed that the cDNA variants were the result of splicing out of exon 9 (encoding the N9 subdomain) and part of exon 3 (encoding the N3 subdomain). Nuclease S1 analysis and the polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that exon 7 (N7 subdomain) was also subject to alternative splicing in normal skin fibroblasts. Examination of these splicing events by nuclease S1 analysis in normal fibroblasts, three different human tumor cell lines, and several human tissues showed that splicing out of exon 9 is much more efficient in normal as compared to tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588812766,"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells polarize and generate distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains when grown on permeable filter supports. Under these conditions, they transcytose fluid-phase markers. Recently, receptor-mediated transcytosis of epidermal growth factor (EGF) across MDCK cells has been reported (Maratos-Flier, E., Kao, C.-Y. Y., Verdin, E. M., and King, G. L. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1595-1601). We examined the role of the EGF receptor in this process. Transcytosis of EGF occurred only in the basolateral-to-apical direction, was time-dependent, and inhibited by the addition of unlabeled EGF in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast to previous work, we found that only about 5% of basolaterally bound EGF was transported to the apical chamber. The half-time of transport was 90 min. A mutant cell line of MDCK, MDCKII-RCAr, was used to study the expression of the EGF receptor. Cell surface glycoproteins of these mutant cells can be efficiently labeled with [3H]galactose by exogalactosylation. The EGF receptor was found to be expressed only on the basolateral surface. Addition of EGF to the basolateral medium resulted in rapid internalization and degradation of the receptor. Testing directly for transcytosis of basolateral glycoproteins, we detected several proteins transported across the cell. The EGF receptor, however, was not among this group of proteins. Taking these results together, we suggest the following model. Internalization of EGF on the basolateral surface is mediated by the EGF receptor. EGF dissociates from the receptor in an endocytic compartment. A fraction of the EGF is then diverted nonselectively to the transcytotic pathway, as found for other fluid-phase markers previously (Bomsel, M., Prydz, K., Parton, R. G., Gruenberg, J., and Simons, K. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 3243-3258."
https://openalex.org/W1492736084,"Bacteriorhodopsin mutants containing deletions in loop B-C, delta Thr67-Glu74 or delta Gly65-Gln75 or a deletion in the loop E-F, delta Glu161-Ala168, were prepared. Following their expression in Escherichia coli, the mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and refolded with retinal in detergent-phospholipid mixtures. The mutants containing deletions in the loop B-C were normal at 4 degrees C but showed the following changes at 20 degrees C. 1) The lambda max shifted from 540 to below 510 nm; 2) the rates of bleaching by hydroxylamine in the dark increased; and 3) the rate and steady state of proton pumping decreased. Deletion of the eight amino acids in loop E-F did not affect wild-type behavior. However, all the mutant proteins were more prone to thermal and sodium dodecyl sulfate denaturation than the wild-type bacteriorhodopsin. These observations show that the structures of the B-C and E-F loops are not essential for correct folding of bacteriorhodopsin, but they contribute to the stability of the folded protein."
https://openalex.org/W1548081942,"N-Deacetylation is the initial polymer modification step in heparan sulfate biosynthesis and a prerequisite to subsequent N- and O-sulfation. It has previously been shown that the sulfation of liver heparan sulfate is lowered in diabetes (Kjellen, L., Bielefeld, D., and Hook, M. (1983) Diabetes 32, 337-342). To investigate whether the reduced sulfation is the result of a lowered N-deacetylase activity, we have assayed this enzyme in hepatocytes from streptozotocin-diabetic rats. In addition, the activity of the glucuronosyl C5-epimerase, which catalyzes a modification reaction subsequent to N-sulfation, was measured. The deacetylase activity, expressed per microgram of cell protein, was about 40% lower in diabetic hepatocytes as compared with control cells, whereas the epimerase activity was unaffected. Recently, a approximately 110-kDa glycoprotein that carries N-sulfotransferase activity was identified as one of at least two protein components required for N-deacetylation in mouse mastocytoma tissue (Pettersson, I., Kusche, M., Unger, E., Wlad, H., Nylund, L., Lindahl, U., and Kjellen, L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8044-8049). We therefore investigated if the lowered N-deacetylase activity in diabetes could be ascribed to a deficiency in either one of the corresponding rat components. The results indicated that (i) the glycoprotein component is present in limiting amounts in both control and diabetic cells, (ii) diabetes results in a lowered activity of this component, and (iii) excess amounts of the additional protein(s) needed for N-deacetylase activity are present in both control and diabetic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1584026069,"Based on an initial study (Dunn, W. A., Hubbard, A. L., and Aronson, Jr., N. N. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5971-5978), low temperature is often used to selectively inhibit fusion between endosomes and lysosomes. Here we have tried to characterize the nature of this inhibition. In addition to endocytic contents markers, we have used a covalent membrane marker to measure the interaction between endosomes and lysosomes over extended periods of time at low temperature. Mouse macrophage cells (P388D1) and human skin fibroblasts were enzymatically labeled with radioactive galactose to provide a covalent marker for plasma-membrane glycoconjugates. Subsequent endocytic membrane traffic for 24 h at 16 degrees C resulted in a significant transfer of membrane marker, as well as of endocytic contents marker, to high density lysosomes, as observed by subcellular fractionation. The kinetics of this transfer have been analyzed for macrophages using the membrane marker, horseradish peroxidase as fluid-phase, and iodinated acetyl low density lipoprotein as receptor-mediated endocytic contents marker. Transfer to lysosomes occurred only about 6 h after application of the respective marker at 16 degrees C. When transfer to lysosomes was initiated by 15 min preincubation at 37 degrees C, subsequent cooling to 16 degrees C did not inhibit ongoing transfer which continued with the same kinetics as when observed after the lag phase. These results show that low temperature delays an unidentified pre-fusion step, but does not inhibit endosome-lysosome fusion as such."
https://openalex.org/W1536227898,"Gross overproduction of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase in Escherichia coli, by virtue of a multicopy plasmid bearing the sodA gene, decreases enumeration on paraquat-containing agar plates. This reflects growth inhibition, not lethality, since cells on these plates can be rescued by exclusion of dioxygen. Growth in liquid medium revealed that the control strain adapted to growth in the presence of paraquat more rapidly than did the overproducer. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, taken as a representative of the superoxide-inducible soxR regulon, was induced during exposure to paraquat to a much greater extent in the control than in the superoxide dismutase-over-producing strain. These results support the view that overproduction of superoxide dismutase interferes with induction of the soxR regulon and thus prevents a balanced adaptation to the multiple aspects of the toxicity of aerobic paraquat."
https://openalex.org/W2154100621,"To determine whether postmigratory neural crest cells retain the capacity to give rise to multiple cell types, the clonal progeny of embryonic rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) cells were examined in culture. Double labeling with BrdU and neurofilament antibodies demonstrated that neuron precursors from the E14.5 SCG continued to proliferate for several days in culture. Using the BAG retrovirus to examine the progeny of single cells, we obtained several kinds of distinct clones from SCG cultures after 3 days. At E14.5, during peak neurogenesis in vivo, neuron-containing clones composed of one to seven cells were common. At E17.5, after neurons have been born in vivo, most clones in vitro contained flat cells, primarily reflecting glial cell division. Even in cultures from E13.5 ganglia, mixed clones containing neurons and flat cells were rarely observed. These observations suggest that neuronal and nonneuronal cell precursors are specified during or before early gangliogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1488537590,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-I) rapidly inactivates tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase (UK) with nearly identical association rate constants. The contributions of Ser344, Ala345, and Arg346 (P3, P2, and P1 residues, respectively) in PAI-I to inhibition of UK and t-PA were evaluated using combinatorial mutagenesis of the human PAI-I cDNA. A bacteriophage lambda expression library potentially encoding the 8000 unique PAI-I species were screened for inhibitory activity against UK using a fibrin indicator gel. 390 plaques demarcated by zones of retarded fibrinolysis were analyzed to determine the DNA sequences of their associated active PAI-1 species. We found 134 unique PAI-1 variants that retained inhibitory activity towards UK; they contained a variety of amino acids in their P3 and P2 positions but only Arg or, infrequently, Lys in their P1 position. Each of the unique active PAI-1 were assayed for inhibitory activity towards UK or t-PA; many substitutions differentially affected the ability of the inhibitor to inactivate UK and t-PA. For example, replacement of Ser344 and Ala344 with Val and Pro, respectively, yielded a PAI-1 variant exhibiting an association rate constant that was unchanged for t-PA but decreased 23-fold for UK, relative to native PAI-1. In general, the PAI-1 variants were more potent inhibitors of t-PA than UK. Hence, t-PA appears more tolerant than UK of structural diversity present in the P3 and P2 positions of the PAI-1 variants."
https://openalex.org/W1484436824,"The cation specificity and possible exchange modes of the Na+:CO3(2-):HCO3- cotransporter were evaluated by use of basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from rabbit renal cortex. External Li+ inhibited HCO3- gradient-stimulated 22Na uptake, indicating that Li+ interacts with the Na+:CO3(2-):HCO3- cotransporter. No interaction with K+, choline, Rb+, Cs+, or NH4+ could be similarly detected. Imposing an outward Li+ gradient caused quenching of acridine orange fluorescence in the presence but not in the absence of HCO3-, suggesting that Li+:base cotransport takes place via the Na+:CO3(2-):HCO3- cotransporter. Imposing an outward gradient of unlabeled Na+ stimulated the initial rate of 22Na uptake and induced its transient uphill accumulation, indicating Na(+)-Na+ exchange. Na(+)-Na+ exchange was observed in the presence but not in the absence of HCO3- and was inhibited by 4,4‘-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid (DIDS), suggesting that it occurs via the Na+:CO3(2-):HCO3- cotransporter. Similarly, an outward Li+ gradient stimulated uphill 22Na accumulation, indicating Na(+)-Li+ exchange. Na(+)-Li+ exchange was observed in the presence but not in the absence of HCO3-, and was inhibited by DIDS, suggesting that it also occurs via the Na+:CO3(2-):HCO3- cotransporter. Both Na(+)-Na+ and Li(+)-Na+ exchange modes were sensitive to inhibition by harmaline but not by amiloride. We conclude that Li+ is an alternative substrate for the renal Na+:CO3(2-):HCO3- cotransporter. Transport modes of the system include cation:base cotransport and HCO3-dependent cation-cation exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1548328204,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is an essential protein involved in mediating glucocorticoid-regulated gene transcription. The cellular GR concentration is modulated by a number of factors including glucocorticoids, which are capable of down-regulating their own receptor concentration. To further study this phenomenon, the human GR (hGR) gene promoter was isolated and was shown to contain the sequences essential for glucocorticoid-dependent down-regulation in CV-1 cells by gene transfer. Further transfections performed with the hGR gene demonstrated that the nucleotide sequence between -250 and -750 is implicated in the down-regulation of the hGR by hormone. The promoter region of human GR is extremely rich in G+C sequences which are known to be involved in the regulation of many housekeeping genes such as GR, as well as a number of cellular oncogenes. Using a combination of partial purification of DNA-binding proteins, DNA-protein interaction by gel shift analysis and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we have identified a protein factor (GRF-1) of 95 kDa which interacts with the human GR gene fragment implicated in homologous down-regulation. Polyclonal antibodies were then raised against the protein following purification. This method of purification and identification may be universally applied to purify and characterize unknown factors which may be involved in the regulation of genes such as hGR gene."
https://openalex.org/W1605419972,"Prothrombin contains two kringle domains that are removed during activation to the blood clotting enzyme alpha-thrombin. By analogy with other kringle-containing proteins the prothrombin kringles may play a role in the protein-protein interactions necessary for prothrombin activation. Four monoclonal antibodies to prothrombin kringle 2 have been produced against human prothrombin, and a fifth monoclonal antibody was produced against a synthetic peptide consisting of amino acid residues 216-231 of kringle 2. Each antibody was tested for its ability to block prothrombin activation by factor Xa. In the presence of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles and factor Va, two of the antibodies, alpha HII-3 and alpha HII-4, inhibited prothrombin activation at a 90 and 50% level, respectively. Two other monoclonal antibodies (alpha HII-6 and alpha HII-7) and the antipeptide antibody (alpha HII-5) had no effect on prothrombin activation. When factor Xa was the catalyst alone, antibody alpha HII-3 lost the ability to inhibit prothrombin activation whereas antibody alpha HII-4 again partially inhibited the reaction. When human platelets were the reaction surface, the patterns of inhibition by the anti-fragment 2 antibodies were identical to that observed with phospholipid vesicles. These data suggest a role for prothrombin fragment 2 in activation, possibly by mediating the interaction of substrate prothrombin with factor Xa or factor Va on the phospholipid surface."
https://openalex.org/W1605908081,"The human placenta arises from the zygote through single cell intermediates called cytotrophoblasts that in turn give rise to a syncytium. In culture, mononucleated cytotrophoblasts exhibit little, if any, cell division but are converted to multinucleated cells. Choriocarcinoma, the malignant tumor of placenta trophoblast, comprises a mixed population of dividing cellular intermediates that resemble cytotrophoblasts but are less differentiated. Because the choriocarcinoma intermediates arise from dividing cells, the tumor may contain one or more cell types in abundance not present in the population of isolated placental cells. To study placental differentiation through cell-cell interaction, choriocarcinoma cell lines were co-cultured with placenta-derived cytotrophoblasts, and placental hormone biosynthesis, as a marker of differentiation was examined. We reasoned that intermediates formed by the tumor might interact with and complement those intermediates in the placenta-derived cytotrophoblast population. Co-culturing either the JAr or JEG choriocarcinoma cell lines with cytotrophoblasts elevated the synthesis of the chorionic gonadotropin alpha and beta subunits 10-20 fold, and human placental lactogen 5-fold. The effect was specific for these trophoblast-derived cells, since comparable quantities of Chinese hamster ovary or HeLa cells did not affect the placental cytotrophoblast culture. Further experiments suggested that the source of enhanced synthesis was the cytotrophoblasts. We propose that an interaction between cytotrophoblasts and choriocarcinoma cells occurs, which results in an increased number of differentiating cytotrophoblasts. Such co-cultures may represent a model system for examining choriocarcinoma cell interaction with normal cells, a process known to occur in vivo. The data are also consistent with the hypothesis that the regulated chorionic gonadotropin production in the placenta is determined by interaction among trophoblast cells at different stages of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1597075457,"A large German family with autosomal dominantly inherited elliptocytosis, associated with truncated beta-spectrin missing the phosphorylated C-terminal peptide, has been described (Eber, S.W., Morris, S. A., Schroeter, W., and Gratzer, W. B. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 81, 523-530). We have attempted to delineate the molecular defect of this abnormality at the gene level. Southern blot analyses revealed no evidence of a partial gene deletion or rearrangement. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplified several relevant portions of the beta-spectrin gene, using genomic DNA from two different heterozygous patients. No abnormality was found in the last four exons of the beta-spectrin gene produced by PCR. Examination of the introns connecting the last four exons revealed a T to A substitution in the 5' splice site following the exon X in four of eight clones prepared from two affected individuals, but not from a normal subject of this family. To examine the effect of the T to A substitution in these patients, we made cDNA from the reticulocyte mRNA of the patient and examined its composition by PCR. Two distinct PCR fragments produced from the patient's beta-spectrin cDNA were found. One matched the predicted size for normal spectrin, while the other was 197 base pairs shorter. The mutant cDNA sequence revealed that the entire exon preceding the T to A substitution was spliced out, while the two terminal exons were preserved. The deletion of this exon resulted in a frameshift giving a different terminal amino acid (serine instead of leucine) as well as a new termination codon causing a deletion of 129 amino acids including potentially phosphorylated residues."
https://openalex.org/W1535360585,"The subcellular distribution, size, and activation state of protein kinase C (PKC) were studied after short term exposure of rabbit platelets to a saturating dose of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Cytosolic and Nonidet P-40-solubilized particulate extracts prepared from TPA-treated platelets were subjected to analytical column chromatography on Mono Q, hydroxylapatite, and Superose 6/12. PKC activity was assayed according to the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate (i) histone H1 in the presence of the activators calcium, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine; (ii) histone H1 after proteolytic activation of PKC with trypsin; and (iii) protamine in the absence of calcium and lipid. Within 1 min of TPA treatment of platelets, greater than 95% of the PKC activity was particulate associated, as assessed by all three methods. The particulate PKC activity from 1-min TPA-treated cells eluted from Mono Q with approximately 0.35 M NaCl (peak I), and it was highly dependent upon Ca2+ and lipid for optimal histone H1 phosphorylation. With longer exposure times of platelets to TPA, the disappearance of the Mono Q peak I form of PKC was correlated with the production of new PKC species that were released from Mono Q with approximately 0.4 M NaCl (peak II), approximately 0.5 M NaCl (peak III), and approximately 0.6 M NaCl (peak IV). These last forms of PKC were still lipid activated but exhibited little Ca2+ dependence. The Mono Q peak III form displayed a particularly high level of histone H1 phosphorylating activity in the absence of lipid and Ca2+. All of these forms behaved as approximately 65-kDa proteins on Superose 6/12, but on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, Western blotting with anti-PKC-beta antibodies revealed immunoreactive polypeptides of approximately 79 kDa (Mono Q peaks I, II, and IV) and approximately 100-kDa (Mono Q peak III). Hydroxylapatite column chromatography permitted partial resolution of the Mono Q peaks I and II forms, which were eluted within a concentration range of potassium phosphate (100-150 mM) which was typical of the beta isozyme of PKC. Treatment of the Mono Q peak III and IV PKC forms with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the production of the peak I form, which implicated protein phosphorylation in the interconversion of the various PKC forms."
https://openalex.org/W1513417656,"The interaction of promoters contained in a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector was studied after infection of FTO-2B rat hepatoma and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Segments of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter-regulatory region, which are known from previous studies to confer responsiveness to hormones, were linked to the structural genes for bovine growth hormone, amino-3'-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo), and herpes-virus thymidine kinase and inserted into a MoMLV-based retroviral vector. In vectors in which PEPCK was the only internal promoter, it was the major site of gene transcription. This dominant effect was independent of the orientation of the PEPCK promoter relative to the 5' long terminal repeat of the provirus and was noted with as little as -174 base pairs of the 5'-flanking sequence. NIH 3T3 cells, which do not express the endogenous PEPCK gene, transcribed the transduced PEPCK-chimeric genes at the same high levels as was observed in hepatoma cells. When two promoters were present in the provirus, the expression of chimeric structural genes depended on the relative position and orientation of these genes as well as the type of cell infected by the retrovirus. Differential responses of proviral promoters in infected cells were also observed in the presence of hormones. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased the expression of genes linked to the PEPCK promoter in FTO-2B and NIH 3T3 cells, whereas glucocorticoids stimulated transcription from both the PEPCK promoter and the long terminal repeat in FTO-2B cells. The effect of these hormones on transcription of proviral promoters depended on their position relative to the 5' long terminal repeat. In contrast, insulin uniformly inhibited transcription from the PEPCK promoter in a position-independent manner but only in hepatoma cells and not in fibroblasts. In clonally isolated FTO-2B cells infected with a retrovirus, the site of proviral integration was also a major factor determining the expression and hormonal regulation from the internal promoters. The data suggest that the hormonal regulation of the expression of genes contained in retroviral vectors depends on the type and position of the regulatory elements present in the provirus and the lineage of the infected cell."
