https://openalex.org/W2098278242,"In humans, mutations in BMPR1A, SMAD4 and PTEN are responsible for juvenile polyposis syndrome1, juvenile intestinal polyposis2 and Cowden disease3, respectively. The development of polyposis is a common feature of these diseases, suggesting that there is an association between BMP and PTEN pathways4,5. The mechanistic link between BMP and PTEN pathways and the related etiology of juvenile polyposis is unresolved. Here we show that conditional inactivation of Bmpr1a in mice disturbs homeostasis of intestinal epithelial regeneration with an expansion of the stem and progenitor cell populations, eventually leading to intestinal polyposis resembling human juvenile polyposis syndrome. We show that BMP signaling suppresses Wnt signaling to ensure a balanced control of stem cell self-renewal. Mechanistically, PTEN, through phosphatidylinosital-3 kinase–Akt, mediates the convergence of the BMP and Wnt pathways on control of β-catenin. Thus, BMP signaling may control the duplication of intestinal stem cells, thereby preventing crypt fission and the subsequent increase in crypt number."
https://openalex.org/W2108536847,"Recent studies have revealed new roles for NAD and its derivatives in transcriptional regulation. The evolutionarily conserved Sir2 protein family requires NAD for its deacetylase activity and regulates a variety of biological processes, such as stress response, differentiation, metabolism, and aging. Despite its absolute requirement for NAD, the regulation of Sir2 function by NAD biosynthesis pathways is poorly understood in mammals. In this study, we determined the kinetics of the NAD biosynthesis mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), and we examined its effects on the transcriptional regulatory function of the mouse Sir2 ortholog, Sir2α, in mouse fibroblasts. We found that Nampt was the ratelimiting component in this mammalian NAD biosynthesis pathway. Increased dosage of Nampt, but not Nmnat, increased the total cellular NAD level and enhanced the transcriptional regulatory activity of the catalytic domain of Sir2α recruited onto a reporter gene in mouse fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays also demonstrated a significant correlation between the expression profiles of Nampt- and Sir2α-overexpressing cells. These findings suggest that NAD biosynthesis mediated by Nampt regulates the function of Sir2α and thereby plays an important role in controlling various biological events in mammals.

Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of NAD-dependent protein deacetylases (1Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Sir2 proteins possess the unique ability to couple the breakdown of NAD and protein deacetylation to the formation of nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (15Moazed D. Curr. Opin.

This unique requirement for NAD implies that Sir2 proteins function as energy sensors (17Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Imai S. Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Park P.U. Guarente L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or redox sensors (13Fulco M. Schiltz R.L. Iezzi S.

Cell. 2003; 12: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) that link energy metabolism to transcriptional regulation. Since NAD is essential for the Sir2 deacetylase reaction, the regulation of NAD biosynthesis has attracted new attention. In yeast, a strong connection has been established between NAD biosynthesis and Sir2 (Fig. 1A), which mediates transcriptional silencing at telomeres, silent mating-type loci, and ribosomal DNA repeats (17Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Guarente L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that increased dosage of NPT1, which encodes nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, enhances Sir2-dependent transcriptional silencing and extends the life span of yeast mother cells (20Anderson R. Bitterman K. Wood J. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S. Manchester J. Gordon J. Sinclair D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, deletion of NPT1 causes a loss of Sir2-dependent silencing and abrogates the life span extension by caloric restriction (21Lin S.-J. Defossez P.-A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 22Sandmeier J. Celic I. Boeke J. Smith J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 877-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional copies of other genes, PNC1, NMA1, and NMA2, which encode nicotinamidase and nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 and 2, respectively, also increase telomeric and rDNA silencing (20Anderson R. Bitterman K. Wood J. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S. Manchester J. Gordon J. Sinclair D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Most notably, PNC1 mediates the life span extending effect of caloric restriction, and additional copies of PNC1 increase the replicative life span of yeast mother cells dramatically (23Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 24Gallo C.M. Smith Jr., D.L. Smith J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the cellular [NAD]/[NADH] ratio is critical to regulate Sir2 activity in calorie-restricted yeast (25Lin S.-J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Even though the [NAD]/[NADH] ratio also modulates Sir2 function in skeletal muscle differentiation in mammals (13Fulco M. Schiltz R.L. Iezzi S. King M.T. Zhao P. Kashiwaya Y. Hoffman E. Veech R.L. Sartorelli V. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), it is not known whether NAD biosynthesis regulates Sir2 activity in these organisms. In fact, NAD biosynthesis in vertebrates is markedly different from that of yeast and invertebrates (Fig. 1). Vertebrates lack any obvious homolog of the yeast nicotinamidase (Pnc1) (26Rongvaux A. Andris F. Van Gool F. Leo O. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and the recycling of nicotinamide into NAD is more direct (Fig. 1B). Nicotinamide, rather than nicotinic acid, is the major substrate for NAD biosynthesis in mammals (27Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of being deamidated, nicotinamide is converted into NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt). 1The abbreviations used are: Nampt, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; Nmnat, nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcription; PBEF, pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor. NMN is then directly synthesized into NAD by nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) (28Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Schweigler M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Since Nampt and Nmnat are sufficient to synthesize NAD from nicotinamide in mammals (Fig. 1B), we hypothesized that this NAD biosynthesis pathway regulates mammalian Sir2 activity. We also suspected that Nampt might be the main regulatory component in this pathway, since its presence provides new dynamics of NAD biosynthesis for vertebrates compared with yeast and invertebrates (Fig. 1B). Nampt, originally identified in Haemophilus ducreyi (30Martin P. Shea R. Mulks M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), was found to have significant homology to the mammalian pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), a presumptive cytokine capable of stimulating the maturation of B-cell precursors (31Samal B. Sun Y. Stearns G. Xie C. Suggs S. McNiece I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that the mouse PBEF protein immunoprecipitated from liver extracts has the Nampt enzymatic activity (32Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, the kinetic characteristics of the NAD biosynthesis pathway mediated by Nampt and Nmnat have not yet been determined. In this study, we characterized the biochemical natures of mouse Nampt and Nmnat by developing an enzyme-coupled fluorometric assay and reconstituting mammalian NAD biosynthesis in vitro with purified recombinant proteins. We also examined the effect of these enzymes on the function of the mouse Sir2 ortholog, Sir2α, in mouse fibroblasts. Increasing the dosage of Nampt, but not Nmnat, increased the total cellular level of NAD and enhanced the transcriptional regulatory activity of Sir2α. Finally, we identified common gene expression changes in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing Sir2α and Nampt. Taken together, our results establish Nampt as the rate-limiting component of the mammalian NAD biosynthesis pathway from nicotinamide and shed new light on the connection between NAD biosynthesis and the regulation of Sir2 activity in mammals. Cell Culture—All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All NIH3T3 cell lines used in this study were established by selecting in the presence of 650–700 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). Plasmids—The coding regions of mouse Nampt and Nmnat cDNAs were amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library (Clontech) by PCR with PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene, CA) and the following forward and reverse primers containing EcoRI sites: Nampt forward, TTAGAATTCAGCCCATTTTTCTCCTTGCT; Nampt reverse, TTAGAATTCACATAACAACCCGGCCACATG; and Nmnat forward, TTAGAATTCTGGAGGACTAGGGCCGTT; Nmnat reverse, TTAGAATTCTGCCCTGTGTCACAGAGTG. The resulting 1584- and 972-bp fragments of Nampt and Nmnat cDNAs, respectively, were digested with EcoRI and cloned into the pBluescript SK-vector. Nampt and Nmnat cDNA fragments were then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCXN2 (33Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J.-I. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki, Osaka University, Japan). To create N-terminal His-tagged recombinant proteins of these two enzymes, Nampt and Nmnat cDNA fragments were re-amplified by PCR to create EcoRI and NdeI sites at the 5′ ends of each cDNA, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the pET-28a(+) vectors (EMD Biosciences). To create expression vectors for Nampt and Nmnat proteins fused to GFP at their C termini, the Nampt and Nmnat cDNA fragments were cloned between EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) after modifying their stop codons. All Nampt and Nmnat cDNA inserts were sequenced, and those sequences were deposited in the GenBank™ data base as accession numbers AY679720 and AY679721, respectively. To make effector plasmids of mouse Sir2α for reporter gene transcription assays, the DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 220–500 of the wild-type and mutant Sir2α (8Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y.

Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers that created EcoRI sites at both ends of each fragment. They were cloned into the EcoRI site of the pM mammalian expression vector (Clontech) to produce the N-terminal fusion to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. To make the expression vector for the C-terminally GFP-fused Sir2α protein, the Sir2α minigene that carries the 2.2-kbp Sir2α cDNA fragment, whose stop codon was modified, and a 1.3-kbp genomic fragment of the Sir2α gene upstream region was inserted between EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector after removing its cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter. The mouse Sir2α expression vector, pBabe-Sir2α, was a gift from Dr. Homayoun Vaziri at the University of Toronto. All necessary plasmids were prepared by using the QIAfilter plasmid midi kit (Qiagen). Phylogenetic Analysis of Nampt Protein Sequences—Amino acid sequences of Nampt proteins in different species were compared by using ClustalX software. A phylogenetic tree was created by using ClustalX and NJPLOT. Production of Recombinant Nampt and Nmnat Proteins— BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with each of His-tagged Nampt and Nmnat plasmids. Transformed BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in 25 ml of Terrific broth containing 75 μg/ml kanamycin and 37 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells were spun down, resuspended in 500 ml of the same media, and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. His-tagged recombinant proteins were then induced by 1.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). After inducing for 5 h at 37 °C, cells were spun down and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and lysozyme. The lysate was then produced with a French press and cleared at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The His-tagged Nampt and Nmnat recombinant proteins were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) by washing with lysis buffer and wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 40 mm imidazole) and eluting with 150 mm imidazole-containing buffer. Enzyme-coupled Fluorometric Assays—Enzymatic activities of recombinant Nampt and Nmnat proteins were measured by an enzyme-coupled fluorometric assay. To establish this assay system, optimal reaction conditions for Nmnat were initially examined by varying ATP and Mg2+ concentrations and pH of the reaction buffer. The resultant reaction buffer for Nmnat contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1.5% ethanol, and 30 μg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase to convert NAD to NADH. To determine the kinetic parameters for Nmnat, 30 ng of purified His-tagged Nmnat and varying concentrations of NMN were added to 1 ml of the reaction buffer. The reactions were run at 37 °C and quenched at six time points by the addition of 250 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The production of NADH was measured by excitation at 340 nm and emission at 460 nm in a fluorometer. For kinetic characterization of Nampt, 500 ng of His-tagged Nampt and varying concentrations of nicotinamide were reacted at 37 °C in 100 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 12 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 10 μg/ml His-tagged Nmnat, 0.4 mm phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), 1.5% ethanol, and 30 μg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase. NADH production was measured continuously in a fluorometer. HPLC Detection of Nampt Reaction Products—HPLC was performed with Waters 515 pumps and a 2487 detector (Waters) with a Supelco LC-18-T column (15 × 4.6 cm). The Nampt reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 15 min in 500 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm nicotinamide, 0.2 mm PRPP) with 50 μg of the recombinant Nampt protein. The reaction was terminated by adding 125 μl of 1 m HClO4. Protein was then precipitated at 18,000 × g, and 500 μl of the supernatant was neutralized with 40 μl of 3 m K2CO3. After centrifugation, 100 μl of sample was mixed with 400 μl of Buffer A (50 mm K2PO4/KHPO4, pH 7.0) and loaded into the HPLC system. The products from Nampt reaction were monitored by absorbance at 261 nm. Antibody Generation—Polyclonal rabbit antisera were produced against the purified full-length His-tagged Nampt and Nmnat recombinant proteins (Covance, PA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Sir2α antiserum was also raised against an N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–131) of mouse Sir2α. Specific antibodies were affinity-purified from these antisera with HiTrap affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with each protein. Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared with Laemmli's sample buffer. Proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE with 4–15% gradient or 12% gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, MA). Uniform transfer was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T buffer) and 5% dry milk (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times in TBS-T. Membranes were blotted overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted at an appropriate dilution ratio in TBS-T with 5% dry milk and then with a secondary donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, signals were developed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). NAD Measurement—NAD was measured by HPLC, as described previously (34Neubert D. Schulz H.U. Hoehne R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 92: 610-612PubMed Google Scholar, 35Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Amici A. Fanelli M. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Chromatogr. B. 1996; 676: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and harvested 48 h later in 800 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then spun down and lysed with 300 μlof1 m HClO4 on ice for 10 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 4 °C at 18,000 × g for 5 min. Cleared lysates (240 μl) were neutralized by adding 80 μl of 3 m K2CO3 and incubating on ice for 10 min. After centrifuging for 10 min, 100 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 400 μl of Buffer A and loaded onto the column. The HPLC was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with 100% Buffer A from 0 to 5 min, a linear gradient to 95% Buffer A and 5% Buffer B (100% methanol) from 5 to 6 min, 95% Buffer A and 5% Buffer B from 6–11 min, a linear gradient to 85% Buffer A and 15% Buffer B from 11 to 13 min, 85% Buffer A and 15% Buffer B from 13 to 23 min, and a linear gradient to 100% Buffer A from 23 to 24 min. NAD was eluted as a sharp peak at 22 min. The amount of NAD was quantitated based on the peak area compared with a standard curve. Luciferase Assay—1.2 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes. 24 h after plating, cells were transfected for 3 h with 380 ng of pUAS4tk-luc as a reporter, 1.5 μg of pM or pM-GAL4DBD-mCORE as an effector, and 38 ng of pRL-SV40 (Promega, WI) as a normalization control by using Superfect (Qiagen). Transfectants were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI) and a SIRIUS luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Germany) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Background luminescence was subtracted and was always less than 1% of measured values. Transfection efficiencies were normalized based on Renilla luciferase activities. 5 mm nicotinamide or 5 mm nicotinic acid was added 24 h after transfection. To examine the effects of Nampt and Nmnat on the transcriptional repressive activity of GAL4DBD-mCORE, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with the indicated amounts of Nampt and Nmnat expression vectors along with reporter, effector, and normalization control plasmids. Microarray Analysis—RNA samples were purified from Nampt-overexpressing (Nampt1), Sir2α-overexpressing (Sir2α), and neomycin-resistant control (Neo1) NIH3T3 cell lines by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality of RNA was examined by capillary electrophoresis. Eight micrograms of total RNA from each of the NIH3T3 cell lines were converted to cDNA by using the 3DNA Array 350 Expression array detection kit (Genisphere) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarray hybridization was then conducted with Cy3-and Cy5-labeled dendrimers as described (36Scearce L.M. Brestelli J.E. McWeeney S.K. Lee C.S. Mazzarelli J. Pinney D.F. Pizaro A. Stoeckert JR., C.J. Clifton S.W. Permutt M.A. Brown J. Melton D.A. Kaestner K.H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Hybridization was conducted at 42 °C for 18 h in MWG Coverslips Hybridization Buffer (MWG Biotec), and all posthybridization washes were carried out at 25 °C. To increase the accuracy of the microarray analysis, we performed dye-swap experiments for each pair of cell lines (Nampt1 versus Neo1 and Sir2α versus Neo1). Microarray hybridizations were performed in duplicate for each pair with the exception that the Cy3-Cy5 labeling scheme was swapped between hybridizations, i.e. control-Cy3, experimental-Cy5 and experimental-Cy5, control-Cy3 (see Fig. 7A). Including dye swaps, four microarray slides were used for each pairwise comparison. A ScanArray Express HT scanner and accompanying software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to scan the slides and analyze the raw data, including normalization according to the Lowess method (37Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). Spots used for statistical analysis satisfied the following criteria on at least three of the slides for both sets of comparisons: 1) ScanArray Express FLAG = 3; 2) signal to noise ratio ≥2 in both channels. Spot-specific dye bias was corrected by subtracting a correction factor from the log2 of the Lowessnormalized median of ratios in the Cy5 and Cy3 channels. It has been reported that combining dye swapping and filtering out spots with signal intensities near background enables highly reproducible detection of gene expression changes with ratios as low as 1.2-fold (38Miller L.D. Long P.M. Wong L. Mukherjee S. McShane L.M. Liu E.T. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which we confirmed in our preliminary microarray experiments. Therefore, genes determined to be changed exhibited at least 1.2-fold differences between experimental and control cell lines with 95% confidence intervals that did not overlap the fold change of 1. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA samples were purified as described above. For each sample, cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA using an Omniscript kit (Qiagen) with random hexamer primers and RNase inhibitor (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The real time quantitative RT-PCR was carried out in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosytems) with a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems) and gene-specific primers. Primer sequences are available upon request. Briefly, 2 μl of cDNA template (comparable with 200 ng of total RNA) were added to each well in a 96-well reaction plate, and the transcripts of each gene were amplified in triplicate. Average CT values were calculated, and the ΔCT values relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control were computed for each gene. Subsequently, ΔΔCT was computed for each gene by subtracting the average ΔCT for Nampt1- or Sir2α-overexpressing NIH3T3 cell lines from the average ΔCT for the Neo1 control. The final fold differences were computed as 2–ΔΔCT for each gene. The measurements were repeated three times with three independent RNA samples for each gene. Biochemical Characterization of Two Critical Enzymes in the Mouse NAD Biosynthesis Pathway Starting from Nicotinamide—In mammals, NAD biosynthesis from nicotinamide is catalyzed by two enzymes, Nampt and Nmnat (Fig. 1B). To examine the connection between this NAD biosynthesis pathway and Sir2 activity, full-length cDNAs of the mouse Nampt and Nmnat genes were isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library by PCR. We isolated the mouse Nampt cDNA, based on a homology search in the mouse EST data base to the amino acid sequence of H. ducreyi Nampt (30Martin P. Shea R. Mulks M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We also isolated the mouse ortholog to the human NMNAT-1 gene, which we refer to as Nmnat in this paper. The mouse Nmnat gene was previously cloned as a fusion gene from the slow Wallerian degeneration mutant mouse (39Mack T.G. Reiner M. Beirowski B. Mi W. Emanuelli M. Wagner D. Thomson D. Gillingwater T. Court F. Conforti L. Fernando F.S. Tarlton A. Andressen C. Addicks K. Magni G. Ribchester R.R. Perry V.H. Coleman M.P. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). We first reconstituted the NAD biosynthesis pathway in vitro with His-tagged recombinant enzymes and developed an enzyme-coupled fluorometric assay (Fig. 2A). In this enzyme-coupled reaction, NAD is converted to NADH by alcohol dehydrogenase, and the fluorescence of NADH is detected in a fluorometer. Bacterially produced, His-tagged recombinant mouse Nampt and Nmnat proteins showed molecular masses of ∼59 and 35 kDa, respectively, which are consistent with those predicted from their amino acid sequences (Fig. 2B). The in vitro reconstituted NAD biosynthesis reaction generated NAD from nicotinamide, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), and ATP (Fig. 2C). No NAD was produced in the absence of nicotinamide or PRPP, the substrates of Nampt (Fig. 2C). We further confirmed by HPLC that the mouse Nampt produced NMN from nicotinamide and PRPP (Fig. 2D). Nampt failed to catalyze the synthesis of nicotinic acid mononucleotide from nicotinic acid and PRPP (see Supplemental Fig. 1), confirming the substrate specificity of this enzyme. In isolated reactions, we also confirmed that Nmnat catalyzed the synthesis of NAD from NMN and ATP (data not shown). By using this enzyme-coupled fluorometric assay, we determined the kinetic parameters of purified recombinant mouse Nampt and Nmnat for nicotinamide and NMN, respectively (Table I). The Lineweaver-Burk plots for these two enzymes are shown in Fig. 3. Compared with reported kinetic parameters of other enzymes in the NAD biosynthesis pathways (40Micheli V. Sestini S"
https://openalex.org/W2067836657,"Integrins are important adhesion receptors in all Metazoa that transmit conformational change bidirectionally across the membrane. Integrin alpha and beta subunits form a head and two long legs in the ectodomain and span the membrane. Here, we define with crystal structures the atomic basis for allosteric regulation of the conformation and affinity for ligand of the integrin ectodomain, and how fibrinogen-mimetic therapeutics bind to platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta3. Allostery in the beta3 I domain alters three metal binding sites, associated loops and alpha1- and alpha7-helices. Piston-like displacement of the alpha7-helix causes a 62 degrees reorientation between the beta3 I and hybrid domains. Transmission through the rigidly connected plexin/semaphorin/integrin (PSI) domain in the upper beta3 leg causes a 70 A separation between the knees of the alpha and beta legs. Allostery in the head thus disrupts interaction between the legs in a previously described low-affinity bent integrin conformation, and leg extension positions the high-affinity head far above the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2127203245,"Exaggerated levels of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) are present in persons with asthma, but the role(s) of VEGF in normal and asthmatic lungs has not been defined. We generated lung-targeted VEGF(165) transgenic mice and evaluated the role of VEGF in T-helper type 2 cell (T(H)2)-mediated inflammation. In these mice, VEGF induced, through IL-13-dependent and -independent pathways, an asthma-like phenotype with inflammation, parenchymal and vascular remodeling, edema, mucus metaplasia, myocyte hyperplasia and airway hyper-responsiveness. VEGF also enhanced respiratory antigen sensitization and T(H)2 inflammation and increased the number of activated DC2 dendritic cells. In antigen-induced inflammation, VEGF was produced by epithelial cells and preferentially by T(H)2 versus T(H)1 cells. In this setting, it had a critical role in T(H)2 inflammation, cytokine production and physiologic dysregulation. Thus, VEGF is a mediator of vascular and extravascular remodeling and inflammation that enhances antigen sensitization and is crucial in adaptive T(H)2 inflammation. VEGF regulation may be therapeutic in asthma and other T(H)2 disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2060248414,"Mathematical models have recently been used to predict the future burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB)1,2,3. These models suggest the threat of multidrug resistance to TB control will depend on the relative 'fitness' of MDR strains and imply that if the average fitness of MDR strains is considerably less than that of drug-sensitive strains, the emergence of resistance will not jeopardize the success of tuberculosis control efforts. Multidrug resistance in M. tuberculosis is conferred by the sequential acquisition of a number of different single-locus mutations that have been shown to have heterogeneous phenotypic effects. Here we model the impact of initial fitness estimates on the emergence of MDRTB assuming that the relative fitness of MDR strains is heterogeneous. We find that even when the average relative fitness of MDR strains is low and a well-functioning control program is in place, a small subpopulation of a relatively fit MDR strain may eventually outcompete both the drug-sensitive strains and the less fit MDR strains. These results imply that current epidemiological measures and short-term trends in the burden of MDRTB do not provide evidence that MDRTB strains can be contained in the absence of specific efforts to limit transmission from those with MDR disease."

We purified ADAM 12 from the urine of breast cancer patients via Q-Sepharose anion exchange and gelatin-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Four peptides were identified that spanned the amino acid sequence of ADAM 12. Immunoblot analysis using ADAM 12-specific antibodies detected an ∼68-kDa band identified as the mature form of ADAM 12. To characterize catalytic properties of ADAM 12, full-length ADAM 12-S was expressed in COS-7 cells and purified. Substrate specificity studies demonstrated that ADAM 12-S degrades gelatin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin but not type I collagen or casein. Gelatinase activity of ADAM 12 was completely abrogated by zinc chelators 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA and was partially inhibited by the hydroxamate inhibitor Marimastat. Endogenous matrix metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP-3 inhibited activity. To validate our initial identification of this enzyme in human urine, 117 urine samples from breast cancer patients and controls were analyzed by immunoblot. The majority of samples from cancer patients were positive for ADAM 12 (67 of 71, sensitivity 0.94) compared with urine from controls in which ADAM 12 was detected with significantly lower frequency. Densitometric analyses of immunoblots demonstrated that ADAM 12 protein levels were higher in urine from breast cancer patients than in control urine. In addition, median levels of ADAM 12 in urine significantly increased with disease progression. These data demonstrate for the first time that ADAM 12 is a gelatinase, that it can be detected in breast cancer patient urine, and that increased urinary levels of this protein correlate with breast cancer progression. They further support the possibility that detection of urinary ADAM 12 may prove useful in the development of noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic tests for breast and perhaps other cancers.

ADAMs 1The abbreviations used are: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; ADAM 12-L, membrane-anchored long form of ADAM 12; ADAM 12-S, secreted form of ADAM-12; ADH, atypical ductal hyperplasia; LCIS, lobular carcinoma in situ; DCIS, ductal carcinoma in situ; IBC, locally invasive breast cancer; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; ECM, extracellular matrix; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein. (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) are a family of integral membrane and secreted glycoproteins that are related to snake venom metalloproteases and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). These proteases are multidomain proteins composed of a prodomain, metalloprotease domain, disintegrin domain, and a cysteine-rich region, and membrane-anchored ADAMs also contain a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain. ADAMs display diverse roles in cell surface remodeling, ectodomain shedding, regulation of growth factor availability, and in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in both normal development and pathological states such as Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, cancer, and cardiac hypertrophy (1Buxbaum J.D.

Recently, ADAM 12 has been reported to play a role in cardiac hypertrophy, cleaving membrane-bound heparin-binding-EGF in response to G protein-coupled receptor stimulation of cardiomyocytes leading to shedding of heparin-binding EGF from the cell surface and transactivation of the EGF receptor (8Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumara Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat.

In vitro, the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM 12 has been shown to support tumor cell adhesion mediated through syndecans and integrin cell surface receptors to generate signals for cell adhesion and spreading (10Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). ADAM 12 mRNA levels are increased almost 6-fold in hepatocellular carcinoma, and its expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and progression (11Le Pabic H. Bonnier D. Wewer U.M. Coutand A. Musso O. Baffet G. Clement B. Theret N. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1056-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). MMPs, a class of matrix-degrading enzymes, play an important role in tumor growth and metastasis and are involved in the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (12Lochter A. Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S42-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of MMPs have been measured in body fluids such as serum and plasma of human patients and in tumor-bearing animals. More recently, we have reported that MMPs can also be detected in urine of patients with a variety of cancers including prostate, bladder, renal, and breast and serve as independent predictors of disease status (14Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Loughlin K.R. Zurakowski D. Lamb C.C. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1395-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Our research has also identified an ∼125-kDa gelatinase species in urine of cancer patients as a complex of MMP-9 with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and showed its presence in urine to be predictive of disease status (15Yan L. Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Moses M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37258-37265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). A number of studies have confirmed these original findings in a variety of human cancers; however, the presence of other proteases as disease markers in urine has not yet been thoroughly explored. The present study is the result of a biomarker identification initiative in our group whose goal is to identify proteins present in urine of cancer patients and to determine whether their presence might be relevant to disease status. Using anion exchange and affinity chromatographic steps followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we identified ADAM 12 in urine from breast cancer patients. This result was confirmed by Western blot analysis of urine using ADAM 12-specific antibodies. Comparative analysis of urine from breast cancer patients and healthy individuals showed not only that detection of ADAM 12 in urine is indicative of disease status but also that levels of this enzyme in urine correlate with stages of disease. The physiological substrate of ADAM 12 has not yet been determined. Given the importance of extracellular matrix degradation in tumorigenesis and metastasis we tested the ability of this metalloprotease to degrade ECM components. We found that ADAM 12 can degrade various ECM proteins including gelatin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin, suggesting a potential role for this enzyme in ECM remodeling, a hallmark of neoplastic disease. Identification of Urinary ADAM 12—Initial identification of ADAM 12 was made using 50 ml of urine (total protein ∼5 mg). Urine was concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon membrane XM-50 (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The sample was diluted with 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (buffer A) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column. After washing, a gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in buffer A was applied. Fractions containing gelatinase activity were pooled, the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 200 mm, and the fractions were incubated with gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. After a wash step, elution was performed using a stepwise gradient of 5, 10, and 20% Me2SO, respectively, in buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl. Eluted fractions were concentrated and separated via SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and stained using the Sterling rapid silver stain kit (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Several distinct bands of ∼52, 80, 120, and 140 kDa were detected. Protein bands were excised from the gel, subjected to tryptic digest, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Perceptive STR, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) to determine the molecular weights of the proteins and for peptide mapping of the tryptic digests using a 337-nm wavelength laser for desorption and the reflectron mode of analysis. Using the MSFit search program the peptide maps generated were searched against a FASTA data base of public domain proteins constructed of protein entries in the non-redundant data base held by the NCBI and Swiss-Prot. Peptide matches identified by MSFit were filtered according to their MOWSE (molecular weight search) score, percentage of masses matched, molecular weight, and number of observations of peptides and proteins. For conservative identification of proteins at least two peptides with good scores that match a single protein are required. Expression and Purification of ADAM 12-S—The full-length human ADAM 12-S gene was cloned into a plasmid (p1151), and transfection of COS-7 cells (ATCC, CRL 1651) was conducted as described previously (5Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Expressed recombinant ADAM 12-S secreted into the conditioned medium was purified as described previously with minor modifications. Briefly, conditioned medium from transfected COS-7 cells was subjected to successive steps of SP-Sepharose and concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography as described (6Loechel F. Fox J.W. Murphy G. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). ADAM 12-S containing fractions from the concanavalin A-Sepharose column were pooled and after buffer exchange applied to a Vivapure H Mini Q column (VivaScience, Carlsbad, CA) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.05% CHAPS. Pure ADAM 12-S was detected in the flow-through fraction as determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Substrate Specificity Studies—Gelatin-, type IV collagen-, fibronectin-, and casein-degrading activities of ADAM 12-S was measured as described previously (14Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Loughlin K.R. Zurakowski D. Lamb C.C. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1395-1399PubMed Google Scholar). ADAM 12-S (1 μm) was mixed with non-reducing sample buffer and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing either 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% type IV collagen, or 0.02% fibronectin and a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% casein. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Substrate digestion was conducted by incubating the gel in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 0.02% NaN3 at 37 °C for 18 h. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie, and bands of enzyme activity were detected as zones of clearance on a background of uniform blue staining. To determine whether ADAM 12 possessed type I collagen-degrading activity, pure enzyme (1 μm) was analyzed using a radiometric collagenase assay as described previously (16Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). For inhibition assays, ADAM 12 (160 nm) was incubated with 30 μg of gelatin in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) in the presence or absence of various inhibitors: 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Marimastat, or two different concentrations (100 and 500 nm) of either TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, or TIMP-4 in a final volume of 30 μl at 37 °C for 18 h. Reactions were stopped with the addition of non-reducing sample buffer, and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie staining. Urine Sample Collection and Processing—Urine collection was performed as described previously (14Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Loughlin K.R. Zurakowski D. Lamb C.C. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1395-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were collected in sterile containers and immediately frozen at -20 °C. Urine was collected according to the institutional bioethical guidelines pertaining to discarded clinical material. Prior to analysis, urine was tested for the presence of blood and leukocytes using Multistix 9 urinalysis strips (Bayer, Elkhart, IN), and samples containing blood or leukocytes were excluded. Creatinine concentration of urine was determined using a commercial kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration of urine was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Patient Population—117 urine samples were analyzed for the presence of ADAM 12. The control group consisted of 46 women (median age ∼50 years) with no discernable disease. The breast cancer group included 71 patients diagnosed at various stages of breast cancer including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), locally invasive breast cancer (IBC), and metastatic disease (see Fig. 3B). Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and treated as described previously (15Yan L. Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Moses M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37258-37265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Polyclonal antibodies against human ADAM 12, rb122 (4Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and S-18 (sc-16526, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were used at 1 μg/ml and 2 μg/ml concentration, respectively. Band intensities were analyzed with UN-SCAN-IT™ (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT) software digitizer technology. Statistical Analysis—Sensitivity, specificity, false-positive rate, false-negative rate, and likelihood ratio were calculated using standard formulas. The presence of ADAM 12 was compared between cancer groups (ADH/LCIS, DCIS, IBC, and metastatic disease) and controls using logistic regression analysis. For each group, the presence of ADAM 12 is expressed as a percentage, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated based on the normal approximation. The nonlinear relationship between ADAM 12 level and breast cancer was modeled using logistic regression analysis with probability determined by maximum likelihood estimation for selected intervals of ADAM 12 (17Breslow N.E. Day N.E. Statistical Methods in Cancer Research: The Analysis of Case-control Studies. 1. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1980: 192-224Google Scholar). Median levels of ADAM 12 were compared between controls and cancer patients using the Kruskal-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons based on Mann-Whitney U tests, whereas mean levels were compared by analysis of variance. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ADAM 12, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to plot all pairs of true positives and false positives for varying levels of ADAM 12. ROC curves were constructed for differentiating between all breast cancer patients and controls and separately for each cancer group. ROC curves that go up steeply from (0, 0) and reach near (0, 1) indicate a test that is almost perfect in discriminating cancer patients from controls, whereas curves close to the 45° diagonal line have low discriminatory power. Area under the curve with 95% confidence intervals were determined using the Hanley-McNeil algorithm as an index of the performance of ADAM 12 as a biomarker of disease. In addition, the area under the curve equals the probability that a randomly chosen pair of patients and controls will be correctly classified. Actual numbers of cancer patients and controls are depicted as histograms with the theoretical probability curve superimposed to illustrate the increasing likelihood of breast cancer for higher levels of ADAM 12. To account for multiple comparisons among the five independent groups (four breast cancer groups according to stage of disease and the normal control group), a conservative two-tailed criterion of p < 0.01 (0.05 divided by 5) was regarded as statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed using the SAS statistical package (version 6.12, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A power analysis indicated that a minimum of 13 patients in each of the breast cancer stages would provide 80% power for detecting differences in ADAM 12 level (version 5.0, nQuery Advisor, Statistical Solutions, Boston, MA). Isolation and Identification of ADAM 12—Urine from breast cancer patients was subjected to stepwise chromatography and in an effort to isolate proteases an affinity chromatography step was performed using gelatin-Sepharose. The fact that ADAM 12 bound gelatin-Sepharose beads supported our data (see below) that this enzyme has gelatin-degrading capability. The fraction collected when 20% Me2SO was applied to the gelatin-Sepharose column contained several distinct ∼52-, 80-, 120-, and 140-kDa protein bands (Fig. 1A, lane 2). MALDI-TOF analysis of the ∼120-kDa protein band (Fig. 1A, lane 2,*) identified it as a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 12 (ADAM 12) (accession NP_003465). Four distinct peptides spanning the amino acid sequence of human ADAM 12 were identified (Fig. 1B). The high MOWSE score, percentage of masses matched, and the number of peptides identified predicted the presence of ADAM 12 in the protein band analyzed with high confidence. Peptide 1 and peptide 2 corresponded to regions of the prodomain, peptide 3 corresponded to a region in the catalytic domain, and peptide 4 corresponded to the C-terminal region of ADAM 12-L. To confirm these results, a larger cohort of urine samples including samples from breast cancer patients as well as age- and sex-matched controls was analyzed for ADAM 12. Urine samples were concentrated, normalized for protein (20 μg of total protein was used for each analysis), and subjected to Western blot analysis. In non-reduced urine samples, a polyclonal ADAM 12-specific antibody, rb122, recognized an ∼120-kDa protein band (Fig. 1C, lane 1), whereas an ∼68-kDa band was detected when the sample was reduced with β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Immunoblot analysis with other ADAM 12-specific antibodies, polyclonal antibody S-18 and monoclonal antibodies 8F8 and 6E6, gave similar results (data not shown). Based on molecular mass the ∼68-kDa band was identified as the mature form of ADAM 12-S (5Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In light of the fact that the ADAM 12-specific antibody detected the mature form of the protein in urine of cancer patients the identification of two peptides from the prodomain of ADAM 12 by mass spectrometry was an interesting finding. It has been reported that the ADAM 12 prodomain remains associated with the protease even after furin cleavage (6Loechel F. Fox J.W. Murphy G. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) under non-reducing conditions. This suggests that tryptic cleavage (an essential step preceding mass spectrometric analysis) of this mature ADAM 12-associated propeptide resulted in the detection of the two peptides from the prodomain. Although the size of the protein band detected by immunoblot analysis using ADAM 12-specific antibody is most consistent with that of mature ADAM 12-S, the polyclonal antibody rb122 recognizes the cysteine-rich region of ADAM 12, a region of shared homology in both the -L and -S forms. Therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that the band detected is a processed form of ADAM 12-L. Full-length ADAM 12-L has a reported mass of ∼120 kDa, whereas the mature (without the propeptide) membrane-anchored form is ∼90 kDa (18Cao Y. Kang Q. Zhao Z. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26403-26411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the ∼120-kDa species analyzed by mass spectrometry contained the full-length protein, immunoblot analysis indicated that the major species in urine appears to be the ∼68-kDa mature form of the enzyme. Substrate Specificity of ADAM 12—To test the ability of ADAM 12 to degrade ECM proteins, recombinant ADAM 12-S protein was expressed in COS-7 cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (Fig. 2A). When assayed by substrate zymography, ADAM 12 could proteolytically degrade gelatin. The purified human ADAM 12-S sample consisted of an ∼68-kDa mature form of the enzyme that displayed a gelatinase activity band (Fig. 2B, lane 2). ADAM 12 also degraded fibronectin (Fig. 2B, lane 3) and type IV collagen (Fig. 2B, lane 4) but did not degrade casein (Fig. 2B, lane 5) when assayed by substrate zymography or type I collagen when tested in the radiometric collagenase assay (data not shown). The gelatin-degrading activity of ADAM 12 was used to evaluate the effect of different classes of protease inhibitors on this enzyme. Pure ADAM 12-S was incubated with gelatin (∼140-kDa protein band, Fig. 2C, lane 2) at 37 °C for either 2 or 18 h in the absence (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4) or presence of various inhibitors. Disappearance of the ∼140-kDa band indicated that ADAM 12 cleaved gelatin in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). The classical chelators of zinc metalloproteases, EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, inhibited gelatin degradation by ADAM 12, whereas the addition of 1 mm Marimastat resulted in partial inhibition of enzyme activity (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–7). The endogenous inhibitors TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-4 did not inhibit the gelatinase activity of ADAM 12 even at concentrations 5-fold higher than the enzyme; however, TIMP-3 (500 nm) was an effective inhibitor of ADAM 12 activity (Fig. 2C, lanes 8–15). ADAM 12 Levels during Disease Progression—117 urine specimens were analyzed, including 46 from healthy age-matched female volunteers and 71 from patients that had been diagnosed with various stages of breast cancer. The majority of samples from cancer patients (Fig. 3A, Table I) were positive for ADAM 12 in contrast to the normal urine samples in which ADAM 12 was detected with significantly lower frequency. The frequency of detection of the ADAM 12 species was higher (94%) in the breast cancer group (67 of 71 urine samples were positive) as compared with the control group (15%) (7 of 46 were positive). Urine samples from the breast cancer patients and the control group also differed in the levels of ADAM 12 protein. An immunoblot analysis of representative urine samples from healthy individuals and patients with progressive stages of breast cancer is presented in Fig. 3B. Densitometric analysis of ADAM 12 bands indicated that levels of urinary ADAM 12 increase with progressive stage of disease. Very little or no ADAM 12 was detected in controls; slightly higher protein levels were associated with the initial stages of breast cancer, e.g. ADH/LCIS and DCIS, whereas significantly higher levels were observed in urine from patients with locally invasive and metastatic disease (Fig. 3B).Table IADAM 12 expression in breast cancer patients and controlsControlsADH/LCISDCISIBCMetastaticNo. of patients4613162913Age, years41 ± 1352 ± 657 ± 1359 ± 1255 ± 7Presence of ADAM 127 (15%)10 (78%)13 (82%)25 (86%)11 (85%)ADAM 12 level (DU)aDU, densitometric unitsMean ± S.E.12.4 ± 4.223.0 ± 6.547.0 ± 9.868.4 ± 12.985.9 ± 17.8Median014464380IQRbIQR, interquartile range0-712-3115-6720-9242-106Range0-1440-800-1406-2894-290a DU, densitometric unitsb IQR, interquartile range Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—Table I presents the percentage of patients with positive expression of ADAM 12 as well as the median levels for each group. The mean densitometric score for control samples (12 densitometric units) was set as threshold, and percent positive for each cancer group was calculated relative to the control group. As indicated in Fig. 4A, based on comparing percentages, there was a significantly higher proportion of individuals in each breast cancer group with expression of ADAM 12 compared with controls (all p < 0.01). Table II shows the diagnostic characteristics of ADAM 12 as a dichotomous test (based on positive or negative test result) for all patients and for each cancer stage group. For all cancer patients the sensitivity of ADAM 12 based on any level of positive expression is 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.86–0.98), and the specificity is 0.61 (28 of 46 controls) (95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.75). Setting a threshold value of 12 densitometric units yielded a much higher specificity of 0.85 (39 of 46 controls) for all cancer patients. Overall accuracy was 0.81 based on 95 of the 117 individuals correctly classified as cases or controls (95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.88). The calculated likelihood ratio was 2.4, which for a positive test result indicates that the presence of urinary ADAM 12 is associated with 2.4 times greater likelihood that the individual has breast cancer. Median levels of ADAM 12 for all 71 cancer patients and the 46 controls were 37 (interquartile range 14–84) and 0 (interquartile range 0–7), respectively (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test).

In effect, RAGE and its ligands show sustained colocalization. This is thought to explain the observation that RAGE is expressed at low levels in healthy adults, except at certain pathological sites where it is up-regulated, including diabetic vasculature, sites of chronic inflammation, Alzheimer's brain tissue, and some tumors (4Hofmann M.A. Drury S.

We sought to biochemically characterize mouse sRAGE and describe the mechanism of its synthesis. Malherbe et al. (15Malherbe P. Richards J.G. Gaillard H. Thompson A. Diener C. Schuler A. Huber G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 71: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Yonekura et al. (16Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Sakurai S. Petrova R.G. Abedin M.J. Li H. Yasui K. Takeuchi M.

The resultant frameshift occurs upstream of the transmembrane domain-encoding sequence, thus eliminating this domain and causing human RAGE and sRAGE to have distinct carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences. Here, we report data that suggest that mouse sRAGE is produced by carboxyl-terminal truncation rather than alternative splicing. We describe the glycosylation and disulfide patterns of murine sRAGE and also report a novel purification strategy for sRAGE from mouse lungs that includes heparin affinity chromatography, a characteristic of sRAGE that could have implications on the extracellular localization of sRAGE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESsRAGE Purification from Mouse Lungs—Frozen mouse lungs from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AZ) were used as starting material. Lungs were homogenized in homogenization buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.3 m potassium bromide, 3 mm diethylenetriamine-pentacetic acid, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (10 ml/g tissue) followed by brief sonication and centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Polyethyleneimine (0.01% final) (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) was added to the supernatant to precipitate nucleic acids (17, Jendrisak, J. (1987) in Protein Purification: Micro to Macro: Proceedings of a Cetus-UCLA Symposium, Frisco, March 29–April 4, 1987 (Burgess, R., ed) pp. 75–97, A. R. Liss, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), and then the homogenate was centrifuged again as above.Concanavalin A Batch Extraction—Concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) (∼100 ml) was added to the cleared homogenate and gently stirred overnight at 4 °C. Matrix with bound protein was collected using a scinted glass funnel and packed into a column (2.5 × 20 cm). The column was washed with HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sodium chloride) until A280 reached 0. Bound protein was batch eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sodium chloride, 200 mm methyl α-mannopyranoside at a flow rate of 10 ml/min.Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—Bulk eluate from the concanavalin A batch extraction was dialyzed into Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium chloride) and concentrated to ∼50 ml using an Amicon concentrator (10,000 Da cutoff). The sample was then applied to a column packed with Affi-Gel heparin (Bio-Rad) (∼80-ml column material, 2.5 × 20-cm column) and washed with Buffer A until A280 reached 0. Heparin-binding proteins were eluted with a 0.6%/min gradient of Buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.0 m sodium chloride) into 130 fractions at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions containing sRAGE were identified by Western blotting using an antibody against mouse RAGE/sRAGE as previously described (18Hanford L.E. Fattman C.L. Shaefer L.M. Enghild J.J. Valnickova Z. Oury T.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: S77-S81PubMed Google Scholar). sRAGE-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed in Buffer A.Anion-exchange Chromatography—Pooled fractions from heparin-Sepharose chromatography were concentrated to ∼50 ml as detailed above and applied to a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with Buffer A until A280 reached 0. Proteins were eluted with Buffer B using the following elution profile: 0.5%/min Buffer B for the first 60 ml; 1%/min Buffer B for the next 30 ml; and, thereafter, 100% Buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 95 fractions were collected, and sRAGE-containing fractions were identified as described above and pooled. All of the chromatography was performed on a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system.Amino-terminal Sequencing—Amino-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation was done as described previously (19Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems Model 477A sequencer with on-line phenylthiodantoin analysis using an Applied Biosystems Model 120A HPLC system.Removal of Amino-terminal Blocking Group of sRAGE—Purified sRAGE was deblocked as previously described (19Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) by incubation with Pfu pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan).PCR and RT-PCR—While attempting to clone an alternatively spliced mouse RAGE cDNA that could encode sRAGE, RT-PCR or PCR was performed with mouse lung RNA isolated as previously described (20Oury T.D.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar) or a mouse lung cDNA library (Spring Bioscience, Fremont, CA). Fig. 1 shows the approximate sites along the mouse RAGE cDNA 2Mouse RAGE cDNA sequence can be found in the GenBank™ database under GenBank™ accession number L33412.1. to which primers were targeted. RT-PCR was performed using EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburn, NJ). Conditions were as follows: RT step at 60.0 °C for 30 min and 94.0 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94.0 °C for 15 s, 60.0 °C for 30 s, and 70.0 °C for 1 min 30 s; and a final extension step at 65.0 °C for 7 min. PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher Scientific) and PCR nucleotide mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58.0 °C for 30 s, and 72.0 °C for 2 min; and a final extension step at 72.0 °C for 8 min.Protease Digestion of sRAGE for Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)—For each reaction, 5 μg of purified sRAGE was lyophilized and then reduced (30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark with 8 m urea and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and alkylated (30-min incubation in the dark at room temperature with 10 mm iodoacetamide). Protein was then diluted in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, to dilute the urea and incubated with 0.1 μg of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) or 0.1 μg of thermolysine (Sigma) with 2 mm calcium chloride or 0.1 μg of chymotrypsin (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C.LC-MS/MS—The LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Micromass/Waters, Manchester, United Kingdom) connected to an LC-Packings UltiMate nanoLC system (LC-Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). A nanospray ion source was used to hold the packed PicoFrit™ columns (New Objective, Inc., Woburn, MA) and apply capillary voltage through a Valco union. The PicoFrit columns (75 μm, inner diameter × 10 cm) were packed with Zorbax SB C18 3.5-μm reverse phase column material (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) using a high pressure column loader (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). The column was developed at a flow rate of 200 nl/min and linear gradients from 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid/0.5% acetic acid in water to 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid/0.5% acetic acid in 75% acetonitrile/24.5% water. After data acquisition, the individual MS/MS spectra acquired for each of the precursors within a single LC run were combined, smoothed, deisotoped, and centroided using the Micromass Masslynx data processing software and output as a single Mascot-searchable peak list. The peak list files were used to query the Swiss-Prot data base using the Mascot program (22Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6711) Google Scholar).Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization MALDI-MS—Buffer salts were removed from sRAGE using zip-tips (Millipore Corporation, Danvers, MA), and MALDI-MS was performed using a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer operated in MALDI-MS mode. Spectra were recorded in linear mode (mass determination) or reflector mode (glycosylation studies).Disulfide Characterization—A tryptic map of mouse RAGE was generated by GPMAW (General Protein/Mass Analysis for Windows) software (Lighthouse data, Odense, Denmark). Approximately 400 μg of native purified sRAGE was incubated with 8 μg of trypsin overnight at room temperature. The reaction was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm reaction completion. After trypsinization of nonreduced sRAGE, the peptides were separated by gel filtration (Superdex peptide HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences)) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 250 mm sodium chloride. Each peak from gel filtration was further separated by reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column (Solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; Solvent B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid; elution profile, 2% solvent B/min linear gradient at 200 μl/min). Both chromatography steps were performed using a Pharmacia SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). Peaks from RP-HPLC were subjected to 3–6 cycles of Edman degradation, and these residues were used to identify the corresponding peptide on the tryptic map. If two cysteine-containing peptides were identified from a single RP-HPLC peak with an ∼1:1 intensity, this was taken as evidence of their linkage by a disulfide bond. For confirmation, each of these peaks was subjected to MALDI-MS to verify that the mass corresponded to the combined mass of the two peptides. Finally, protein from each peak was reduced with 5 mm dithiothreitol and again analyzed by MALDI-MS to see whether two distinct masses resulted after reduction. If so, this result would confirm that the two peptides are linked by a disulfide bond.Deglycosylation of Mouse sRAGE—100 μg of purified sRAGE was boiled for 5 min in denaturation buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and cooled. Triton X-100 was added (0.5% final concentration) followed by the addition of 9 units of PNGase F (Calbiochem), and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. For O-deglycosylation, 100 μg of sRAGE in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was incubated with 0.1 unit of neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 18 h. Following this incubation, 1.5 milliunits of O-glycosidase (Roche Applied Science) was added with reaction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5), and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Where indicated, sRAGE underwent PNGase F treatment followed by neuraminidase treatment and O-glycosidase treatment as detailed above. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer.

Mouse lungs were homogenized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The homogenate was then subjected to three successive chromatography steps: 1) concanavalin A-Sepharose; 2) Affi-Gel heparin; and 3) Mono Q-Sepharose. Proteins (26 μl of each sample) were separated after reduction and denaturation in a 5–15% gradient acrylamide gel, and after electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

After intracellular removal of the signal peptide (Met-Pro-Ala... Ala-Gly-Gly, the first 23 residues of the mouse RAGE polypeptide), 3The amino acid sequence of mouse RAGE can be found in the GenBank™ database under GenBank™ accession number 6671525. the amino-terminal sequence becomes Gln1-Asn-Ile-Thr-Ala-Arg... (see Fig. 3). When Gln is the amino-terminal amino acid residue, it may spontaneously undergo deamidation and cyclization to form the cyclic amino acid pyroglutamate, which is unreactive in Edman degradation. To determine whether pyroglutamate is the blocking group at the amino terminus of mouse sRAGE, the purified protein was incubated with Pfu pyroglutamate aminopeptidase and then subjected to Edman degradation. The resulting amino-terminal sequence was determined to begin with Xaa-Ile-Thr-Ala-Arg... This sequence corresponds to an unidentified amino acid residue (Xaa) followed by the third residue after the signal peptide (Ile3), and so on. Notably, Asn2 was not identified as the amino-terminal amino acid residue after treatment with Pfu, because it was glycosylated (see below). Thus, these studies indicate that, after removal of the sRAGE signal peptide, the amino-terminal Gln is modified to form pyroglutamate (depicted in Fig. 4B).Fig. 3Mass spectroscopy sequencing highlights for mouse sRAGE. Mouse sRAGE was proteolyzed with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or thermolysine, and resultant peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS for sequencing.

The alternative splice site is located just upstream of the transmembrane domain and results in a frameshift so that a transmembrane domain is no longer encoded for sRAGE. Thus, human RAGE and sRAGE have distinct carboxyl-terminal sequences. To see whether mouse sRAGE is also produced by alternative splicing, we attempted to detect an alternative RAGE transcript. We used either mouse lung RNA or a mouse lung cDNA library as a template in RT-PCR or PCR. Primers were targeted to each end of the RAGE transcript as well as various internal sites including sequences directly flanking the region homologous to the sequence spliced out in humans (Fig. 1 and Table I) in attempt to detect a smaller amplicon that would indicate alternative splicing analogous to that seen in humans. We found no evidence of an alternative RAGE transcript. However, we were able to amplify mouse membrane RAGE (Fig. 1 and Table I, primers are indicated by an asterisk). Furthermore, we also were able to amplify and clone sRAGE from a human cDNA library whose sequence matched that found by Malherbe et al. (15Malherbe P. Richards J.G. Gaillard H. Thompson A. Diener C.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the mouse sRAGE amino acid sequence, we used LC-MS/MS. Purified mouse sRAGE was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or thermolysine, and peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. We chose to use three proteases so that peptides would overlap, and thus, the sequence data from one digestion would complement the data from the others. Fig. 3 shows highlights from our sequencing data. 81.8% of the sequence between residues Gln1 and Gly307 was covered by the LC-MS/MS analyses. Notably, the carboxyl-terminal end of mouse sRAGE determined from our sequence data is homologous to the point at which the human sRAGE amino acid sequence becomes distinct from that of human membrane RAGE as determined by Yonekura et al. (Fig. 1, vertical arrow) (16Yonekura H. Yamamoto Y. Sakurai S. Petrova R.G. Abedin M.J. Li H. Yasui K. Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto H. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1977656622,"The formation of neuronal networks in the central nervous system (CNS) requires precise control of axonal branch development and stabilization. Here we show that cell-specific ablation of the murine gene Ptk2 (more commonly known as fak), encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK), increases the number of axonal terminals and synapses formed by neurons in vivo. Consistent with this, fak mutant neurons also form greater numbers of axonal branches in culture because they have increased branch formation and reduced branch retraction. Expression of wild-type FAK, but not that of several FAK variants that prevent interactions with regulators of Rho family GTPases including the p190 Rho guanine nuclear exchange factor (p190RhoGEF), rescues the axonal arborization phenotype observed in fak mutant neurons. In addition, expression of a mutant p190RhoGEF that cannot associate with FAK results in a phenotype very similar to that of neurons lacking FAK. Thus, FAK functions as a negative regulator of axonal branching and synapse formation, and it seems to exert its actions, in part, through Rho family GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2152852483,"Stable expression of short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed against the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) resulted in the generation of three MDA-MB-231 cell lines (XIAP shRNA cells) with reductions in XIAP mRNA and protein levels > 85% relative to MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with the U6 RNA polymerase III promoter alone (U6 cells). This RNA interference (RNAi) approach dramatically sensitized these cells to killing by the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Importantly, loss of XIAP also sensitized the cells to killing by taxanes but had no additional effects on killing by carboplatin and doxorubicin. The increased sensitivity of the XIAP shRNA cells to killing by TRAIL and taxanes correlated with enhanced caspase cleavage and activation, including caspase-8, and robust processing of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and BID compared to U6 cells. Additionally, increasing XIAP levels by adenovirus-mediated expression protected both XIAP shRNA and U6 cells from TRAIL killing in a dose-dependent manner. The effects observed by stable RNAi with respect to TRAIL sensitization were also achieved following downregulation of XIAP in Panc-1 cells treated with a second-generation, mixed-backbone antisense oligonucleotide, AEG 35156/GEM640. These data indicate that reducing XIAP protein expression by either RNAi or antisense approaches increases cancer cell susceptibility to functionally diverse chemotherapeutic agents and supports the notion that downregulation of XIAP in vivo may synergize with disease-relevant chemotherapeutic regimes, including TRAIL and taxanes, to increase the effectiveness of antineoplastic agents."

SPI-2 encodes virulence factors (called effectors) that are translocated into the host cell, a type III secretion apparatus and a two-component regulatory system that regulates intracellular expression of SPI-2. Salmonella SPI-2 secretion activity appears to be induced in response to acidification of the vacuole in which it replicates. Here we show that the expression of the SPI-2 proteins, SseB and SseD (filament and pore forming components of the secretion apparatus, respectively) in response to acidification requires an intact secretion system and SsaL, a Salmonella homologue of SepL, a regulator required for type III-dependent secretion of translocators but not effectors in attaching and effacing gastrointestinal pathogens. We show that the expression of SPI-2-encoded effectors is acid-regulated but can be uncoupled from the expression of filament and translocon components, thus showing a differential requirement of SsaL for expression. The secretion and translocation of SPI-2-encoded effectors requires SsaL, but SsaL is dispensable for the secretion of SPI-2 effectors encoded in other pathogenicity loci, suggesting a secretion regulation function for SsaL. Further, we demonstrate that the differential expression of adjacent genes within the sseA operon (sseD and sseE) occurs at the transcriptional level. These data indicate that a Salmonella SPI-2 activation state is achieved by an acidregulated response that requires SsaL.

SPI-2 is a virulence locus that encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS) and related proteins, called effectors, which are substrates of this secretion apparatus. Infection of macrophages by Salmonella activates the SPI-2 virulence locus, which allows Salmonella to establish a replicative vacuole, called the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), inside host cells. SPI-2-dependent activities are responsible for SCV maturation along the endosomal pathway to prevent bacterial degradation in phagolysosomes, for interfering with trafficking of NADPH oxidase-containing vesicles to the SCV (3Vazquez-Torres A.

Several open reading frames encoded within SPI-2 remain uncharacterized, including ssaL, encoding a protein with homology to the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded sepL of the attaching and effacing pathogens enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (18Kresse A.U.

Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6323-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We recently identified sepL in a genetic screen and showed it is required for type III secretion in C. rodentium of the translocon complex, EspA, -B, and -D, but not for the secretion of the LEE-encoded effector Tir (20Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vazquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ssaL and sepL contain no strong homologues in other pathogenic bacteria with type III secretion systems indicating that they probably are not part of the TTSS core complex, which is generally well conserved among type III-containing pathogens (21Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Previous work on the environmental cues within the host cell that activate SPI-2 gene expression and type III secretion has implicated Mg2+ and PO43− ion limitation and pH (15Lee A.K. Detweiler C.S. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Miao E.A. Freeman J.A. Miller S.I. J.

Because the pH of the SCV falls below 5.5 within 20 min after its formation inside infected host cells (24Rathman M. Sjaastad M.D. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2765-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that this environmental cue plays a prominent regulatory role in SPI-2 induction. In vitro conditions resembling the intracellular environment of the SCV such as low pH of minimal medium activate the secretion activity of SPI-2 (22Beuzon C.R. Banks G. Deiwick J. Hensel M. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Rappl C. Deiwick J. Hensel M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 226: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but less is known about how acidic pH regulates SPI-2 gene expression. In two previous studies, the pH of minimal medium did not have an effect on the expression of SPI-2 genes (22Beuzon C.R. Banks G. Deiwick J. Hensel M. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) or on a SPI-2 substrate encoded within a prophage outside of SPI-2 (17Miao E.A. Freeman J.A. Miller S.I. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that acidic pH of minimal medium activated the ssrA promoter in wild-type Salmonella (15Lee A.K. Detweiler C.S. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), highlighting an apparent discrepancy given that SsrA and SsrB are required for SPI-2 gene expression.To examine the way in which Salmonella responds to acidification of the vacuole in which it resides, we analyzed the expression and secretion of SPI-2 effectors and translocators under pH conditions that mimic those of the SCV. We demonstrate that expression and secretion of both translocators and effectors occurs only in acidic minimal medium and not in minimal medium at neutral pH. A Salmonella strain with a mutation in ssaR (a conserved type III apparatus component) is deficient in not only the secretion of effectors and translocators but also in the expression of translocators at acidic pH. A Salmonella strain deficient in ssaL, an uncharacterized SPI-2 open reading frame with homology to the secretion regulator sepL of attaching and effacing pathogens, displays a phenotype distinct from that of the ssaR mutant in that it restricts the expression and secretion of translocators encoded within SPI-2 yet is dispensable for secretion of SPI-2 effectors encoded in other pathogenicity loci. We also demonstrate that, after acidification, a functional type III secretion system and SsaL are required for optimal activation of the sseA promoter, which controls the expression of the SPI-2 filament and pore-forming components, but show that expression of the downstream effectors is differentially regulated with respect to type III secretion and SsaL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Mutant Construction—S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 was used as the wild-type strain throughout this study, and all mutants used in these experiments are isogenic derivatives of SL1344. Strains used in this work are listed in Table I. S. Typhimurium and E. coli strains were routinely cultured in LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics to maintain plasmids as required. A nonpolar, unmarked, in-frame deletion of ssaL was generated by allelic exchange from a counter-selectable suicide vector expressing SacB (26Pelicic V. Reyrat J.M. Gicquel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). First, the ssaL open reading frame and ∼1 kb of flanking genomic DNA upstream and downstream of ssaL were amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers BKC45 (5′-CCA GAG TAT CGG CAA TTG CTT-3′) and BKC46 (5′-AAC AGC CTC ACT CAT CGA CAT-3′) to generate a 3038-bp DNA fragment. This fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to generate a plasmid template that was amplified by inverse PCR using BKC47 (5′-ACG CGT CGA CCA TCG CTA CCT CTT TTA TCT TCA C-3′) and BKC48 (5′-ACG CGT CGA CAA GTC GGT TTT ATT CTG ATA CCT GGC-3′, SalI sites underlined). This PCR product was digested with SalI and then ligated to generate an internal, in-frame deletion allele of ssaL that eliminated the coding region for amino acids 9–333, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction—To generate a wild-type allele of ssaL under the control of its native promoter, SL1344 chromosomal DNA was amplified by PCR using primers BKC69 (5′-CCG CTC GAG ACA TCT CGG GGA GAA CCA TGA A-3′; XhoI site underlined) and BKC70 (5′-AGG AAG CTT ATG ATG AGC CAG AAA GCC AA-3′; HindIII site underlined), which included the ssaL stop codon. The resulting fragment was digested with XhoI and HindIII and cloned into the unique XhoI/HindIII sites of pWSK29. To generate wild-type alleles of sseA-D under the control of a constitutive promoter, chromosomal DNA was amplified by PCR using primers sseA-F (5′-ATG GGA TCC TGT ATA TGG AGG GGA ATG ATG-3′; BamHI site underlined) and sseD-R (5′-ATG GTC GAC TTA CCT CGT TAA TGC CCG GAG-3′; SalI site underlined). The resulting 3487-bp fragment was cloned into pWSK129 as a unique BamHI/SalI fragment under the control of the lacZα promoter. An epitope-tagged version of SsaL was created by fusing a double hemagglutinin tag (2HA) to the carboxyl terminus of SsaL. SsaL and its native promoter were amplified with the primers BKC71 (5′-ACG CGT CGA CAC ATC TCG GGG AGA ACC ATG AA-3′) and BKC72 (5′-CGG GAT CCG AAT AAA ACC TGA TTT ATC TTT ACT TCA CG-3′), which eliminated the ssaL stop codon. The resulting PCR product was digested with SalI/BamHI and cloned into the SalI/BglII sites of pBKC-HA, to generate the ssaL-2HA fusion, which was then moved into pWSK29 to generate an ampicillin-resistant clone for expression in Salmonella. A transcriptional fusion of the sseA promoter to an artificial operon consisting of tnpR and lacZ was constructed by PCR amplifying the promoter region of sseA using oligonucleotides psseAf(5′-ATA CTC GAG CGT ATT CTT GAT TTT CAT CGG TG-3′; XhoI site underlined) and psseAr (5′-ATA CAA TTG CCC TTT CAG CAA GCT GTT GAC-3′; MfeI site underlined) and cloning the product into pIVET5n cut with XhoI and MfeI. The resulting plasmid was integrated into the Salmonella chromosome by homologous recombination. Similar transcriptional fusions to lacZ were created but fused at sseD (oligonucleotides 5′-ATG CAA TTG CTG GTA ATA CCA GTG CTA CGT-3′ and 5′-ATG CTC GAG ACC GGC ATA TTT GAA ACC GTG-3′) and sseE (oligonucleotides 5′-ATG GAA TTC ACC ATT GCT CTA TTT CTT GCA C-3′ and 5′-ATG CTC GAG ACC GGC ATA TTT GAA ACC GTG-3′). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into the appropriate Salmonella strains by either electroporation or conjugation. Plasmid pssrAB was kindly provided by Dr. M. Hensel, Erlangen, Germany. Plasmids encoding the sepL gene and upstream regulatory region from enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli were kindly provided by Dr. W. Deng, University of British Columbia. A list of plasmids used in this work is outlined in Table I.Recombinant SPI-2 Proteins and Generation of Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to SseB, SseD, SseE, and SseG were generated by repeated immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with 1 mg of recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusions of each protein. Each glutathione S-transferase fusion was constructed by PCR amplification of the effector gene from genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium SL1344 using the following primers: SseB, forward 5′-GCA GGA TCC ATG TCT TCA GGA AAC ATC TTA TGG-3′, reverse 5′-CGT GTC GAC TCA TGA GTA CGT TTT CTG CGC TAT-3′; SseD, forward 5′-GCA GGA TCC ATG GAA GCG AGT AAC GTA GCA CTG-3′, reverse 5′-CGT GTC GAC TTA CCT CGT TAA TGC CCG GAG TAT-3′; SseE, forward 5′-GCA GGA TCC ATG GTG CAA GAA ATA GAG CAA TGG-3′, reverse 5′-CGT GTC GAC TTA AAA ACG TCG CTG GAT AAG ATG-3′; SseG, forward 5′-GCA GGA TCC ATG AAA CCT GTT AGC CCA AAT GCT-3′, reverse 5′-CGT GTC GAC TTA CTC CGG CGC ACG TTG TTC TGG-3′. After digestion with BamHI and SalI (sites underlined above), the PCR product was cloned into pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). This plasmid was transformed into the BL21 strain of E. coli, and overexpression of recombinant fusion proteins was accomplished with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h (1 h for expression of SseG). SseB was purified using glutathione-coupled beads (Sigma) according to standard protocols (29Ausubel F.W. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Current Protocols Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987: 16.7.1-16.7.7Google Scholar). Purification of SseD, SseE, and SseG was performed using the Sarkosyl lysis procedure described by Frangioni and Neel (30Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Raw antisera were affinity-purified using Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with covalently coupled antigen. Non-specific cross-reactivity of the antibodies was minimized by incubation with acetone powders of the BL21 strain that was used to overexpress the recombinant fusion proteins.Cell Culture—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For immunofluorescence studies, HeLa cells were seeded onto 1-cm sterile glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes and incubated for ∼18 h prior to infection. For gentamicin protection assays, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were used between passages 10 and 15 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 24-well culture dishes 18 h prior to infection. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Analysis of Salmonella Mutants in Mice—Female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Mice were housed in sterilized, filter-top cages under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of British Columbia Animal Facility. The protocols used here were in direct accordance with animal care guidelines as outlined by the University of British Columbia's Animal Care Committee and the Canadian Council on the Use of Laboratory Animals. Salmonella cultures were grown overnight in LB broth and then diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to give ∼1.6 × 105 cfu/ml. Groups of mice (n = 5) were infected by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of diluted bacterial suspension, followed by daily monitoring throughout the study period. Mice that showed signs of extreme distress were euthanized.Gentamicin Protection Assays—RAW 264.7 cells were infected with opsonized stationary phase bacteria as described previously (31Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Kujat-Choy S. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At 2 and 21 h after infection, gentamicin-treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 0.25 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline. Lysates were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and plated onto LB agar followed by incubation at 37 °C. Colonies were enumerated and expressed as colony forming units (cfu)/ml. The -fold increase in the number of intracellular bacteria was determined by dividing the cfu values at 21 h by the cfu values at 2 h post infection for each condition.In Vitro Secretion Assays—In vitro culture conditions were developed based on minimal medium used to induce expression and secretion of SPI-2 genes (8Nikolaus T.

Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Salmonella strains were grown overnight in LB broth, washed twice in low phosphate, low magnesium-containing medium (LPM) and then inoculated at a 1:50 dilution in 3 ml of LPM medium at either pH 7.0 or 5.8. The composition of LPM medium was 5 mm KCl, 7.5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm K2SO4, 38 mm glycerol (0.3% v/v), 0.1% casamino acids, 8 μm MgCl2, 337 μmPO43−, 100 mm Tris-HCl (for titration to pH 7.0), or 80 mm MES (for titration to pH 5.8). Cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking for 4–6 h after which the optical density at 600 nm was measured. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 rpm (4 °C). The supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration, v/v) at 4 °C for 4–16 h.Analysis of Secreted Proteins—The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction from above was collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold acetone, and solubilized with a volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 200 mm dithiothreitol) adjusted according to the A600 of the original culture. When necessary, solubilized secreted proteins were neutralized with an appropriate volume of non-titrated Tris. The bacterial pellet fraction from above was also dissolved in a volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer adjusted according to the A600 of the original culture. Proteins from equivalent numbers of bacterial cells, as determined by A600 readings, were separated on 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% (w/v) powdered non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with the following primary antibodies in TBST plus 5% nonfat milk:rabbit affinity-purified antibodies raised against recombinant SseB, SseD, SseG, and SseE (1:1500), mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Covance), and mouse anti-DnaK monoclonal antibody (1:3500; Stressgen). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at a 1:5000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Chemiluminescent β-Galactosidase Assays—sseA promoter activity was examined using tran"

Expressed phosphatidylserine functions as an “eat me” flag toward phagocytes. Here, we report that the expressed phosphatidylserine forms part of a hitherto undescribed pinocytic pathway. Annexin A5, a phosphatidylserine-binding protein, binds to and polymerizes through protein-protein interactions on membrane patches expressing phosphatidylserine. The two-dimensional protein network of annexin A5 at the surface prevents apoptotic body formation without interfering with the progression of apoptosis as demonstrated by activation of caspase-3, PtdSer exposure, and DNA fragmentation. The annexin A5 protein network bends the membrane patch nanomechanically into the cell and elicits budding, endocytic vesicle formation, and cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking of the endocytic vesicle. Annexin A1, which binds to PtdSer without forming a two-dimensional protein network, does not induce the formation of endocytic vesicles. This novel pinocytic pathway differs from macropinocytosis, which is preceded by membrane ruffling and actin polymerization. We clearly showed that actin polymerization is not involved in budding and endocytic vesicle formation but is required for intracellular trafficking. The phosphatidylserine-annexin A5-mediated pinocytic pathway is not restricted to cells in apoptosis. We demonstrated that living tumor cells can take up substances through this novel portal of cell entry. This opens new avenues for targeted drug delivery and cell entry.

Programmed cell death eliminates cells from tissues in a silent and non-provocative manner. It is essential for development and tissue homeostasis of the multicellular organism. Apoptosis is the most abundant form of programmed cell death (1Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Its well ordered biochemistry produces the hydrolysis of the vital macromolecular structures of the cell (2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar) and the appearance of a plethora of “eat me” signals at the cell surface (3Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The latter causes tethering to and engulfment by phagocytes. Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CSLM, confocal scanning laser microscopy; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone. is the most well explored “eat me” signal. It is expressed at the cell surface very early after the onset of execution of apoptosis, regardless of the cell type and the apoptosis-inducing trigger (4Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.

It binds reversibly to PtdSer-expressing membranes with high affinity in a calcium-dependent manner (15Andree H.A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Hauptmann R. Hemker H.C. Hermens W.T. Willems G.M. J. Biol.

Binding to PtdSer is accompanied by the formation of a two-dimensional network of annexin A5 molecules through protein-protein interactions (18Mosser G. Ravanat C. Freyssinet J.M. Brisson A. J. Mol.

An exploration of this phenomenon led to the discovery of the existence of a novel endocytic pathway that can be activated during apoptosis. This study describes the elucidation of the mechanism of this PtdSer-dependent novel portal of cell entry. We furthermore show that this endocytic pathway can also be activated in living tumor cells. This knowledge opens novel avenues for delivery and cell entry of therapeutic compounds. Chemicals—Human apo transferrin was purchased from Sigma, and Tris was purchased from Acros Organics. Cell Culture—The T-lymphoma cell line Jurkat (ATCC) was routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), containing 100 units ml-1 penicillin, 0.1 mg ml-1 streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories GmbH). HeLa cells (ATCC), were maintained in modified Eagle's medium with Earl's salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 units ml-1 penicillin, 0.1 mg ml-1 streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO2. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Labeling of Annexin A5, M23, M1234, and Annexin A1—cDNA encoding for the annexin A5 mutant M1234 (E72D, D144N, E228A, and D303N) having four defective calcium binding sites was kindly provided by Prof. Dr. F. Russo-Marie (BIONEXIS-Pharmaceuticals). The M1234 cDNA was recloned to remove the 5′-base pairs responsible for the three extra N-terminal amino acids after expression (21Mira J.P. Dubois T. Oudinet J.P. Lukowski S. Russo-Marie F. Geny B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10474-10482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The annexin A5 mutant M23 was generated by subcloning the mutations D144N and E228A into the annexin A5 cDNA. Annexin A5, M23, and M1234 cDNAs were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-5a (Novagen). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as assessed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Annexin A5, M23, and M1234 were labeled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate and Alexa568-succinimidylester according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). The labeled proteins with 1:1 stoichiometry were purified from the mixtures by MonoQ chromatography with Äcta Explorer (Amersham Biosciences). Annexin A1 was kindly provided by Dr. E. Solito (London, UK). Annexin A1 was labeled with Älexa568-succinimidylester according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PtdSer-binding capacity of annexin A1-Alexa568 was verified by ellipsometry. Analysis of Apoptotic Body Formation—Jurkat cells were washed and resuspended at 106 cells ml-1 in medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplied with 0.5 mm CaCl2. Apoptosis was induced with anti-Fas (200 ng ml-1) in the absence or presence of annexin A5 and M1234. The course of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using the annexin A5-FITC staining protocol (Nexins). Apoptotic body formation was quantified with flow cytometry and subsequent off-line calculation of the percentage of events with reduced forward and sideward scatter. Off-line analysis of the flow cytometer files was performed with WinMDI 2.8 (free share software designed by Joseph Trotter). Caspase-3 Activity, PtdSer Exposure, ROCK-1 Cleavage, and DNA Laddering—Caspase-3 activity was determined in 2.5 × 106 Jurkat cells by resuspending the cells in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) after stimulation with anti-Fas. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (140,000 × g/min, 4 °C). 5 μl of chromogenic substrate (10 mm DEVD-p-nitroanilide (BioSource)) was added to 70 μl of the cellular supernatant. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and optical density (OD) was measured at 405 nm. PtdSer exposure of anti-Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells was measured by flow cytometry using annexin A5-FITC. If apoptosis was executed in the presence of annexin A5, a mixture of 7.5 μgml-1 annexin A5 and 2.5 μgml-1 annexin A5-FITC was added to the cells prior to the addition of anti-Fas. ROCK-1 activation was determined by lysing Jurkat cells in Tris buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates of 106 cells were loaded in each well and submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-ROCK-1 antibody (Santa Cruz). DNA fragmentation was analyzed by resuspending 5 × 106 cells in 600 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). The mixture was incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (140,000 × g/min, 4 °C). DNA was extracted from the supernatant with an equal volume of phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (16:16:1). The water phase was adjusted to 300 mm NaCl and diluted with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. Following overnight precipitation at 4 °C, the DNA was pelleted and washed once with ice-cold 70% ethanol. The DNA was dried in a speed VAC and resuspended in 10 μl of Tris-EDTA containing RNaseA. The DNA fragments were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM)—Jurkat cells (2 × 106 cells ml-1) were stimulated with anti-Fas (200 ng ml-1) in the presence of annexin A5-Alexa568 (20 μg ml-1), annexin A1-Alexa568 (20 μg ml-1), and cytoskeletal agents if indicated. After 3 h the cells were pelleted (2 min, 1000 g), washed with EDTA buffer (140 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and resuspended in Ca2+-buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were stained with annexin A5-Oregon Green (250 ng ml-1) for 5 min, washed, and resuspended in Ca2+ buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After a fixation period of 10 min, the cells were stained with phalloidin-TRITC according to the manufacturers' protocol (Molecular Probes). HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips and left to adhere in culture medium. After 24 h one or a combination of the fluorescent-labeled proteins was added in a concentration of 100 nm. HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h. The HeLa cells were washed sequentially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), EDTA buffer, and PBS. The cells were then fixed for 15 min in Ca2+ buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 8.0, and washed three times for 20 min in PBS. The fixed Jurkat or HeLa cells were mounted in 90% glycerol in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with the addition of 2% 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane (Merck). Slides were examined with a confocal scanning laser microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with a krypton/argon mixed gas laser (Ion Laser Technology). Images were recorded and analyzed with NIH Image, ImageJ, and Adobe PhotoShop. Variations on this standard protocol were used to study the internalization of annexin A5-Alexa568 (100 nm), M1234-Alexa568 (100 nm), annexin A1-Alexa568 (100 nm), M23-Alexa568 (100 nm), transferrin-Oregon Green 488 (100 nm), and Oregon Green-labeled Tris (20 μm) with the succinimidylester group inactivated. Plasmid and Transfection—The plasmid caveolin-1-green fluorescent protein was a kind gift of Dr. D. Mundy (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The plasmid was transfected in HeLa cells with the transfection agent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Immunoelectron Microscopy—2 × 106 Jurkat cells were stimulated with 200 ng ml-1 anti-Fas in the presence of 20 μg ml-1 annexin A5. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g/min) and resuspended in Ca2+ buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde. After 10 min the cells were transferred to Ca2+ buffer containing 1% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 20 μl of PBS containing 10% gelatin, and solidified by cooling down. The gelatin drops were stored overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 2.3 m sucrose and then vitrified in liquid nitrogen for subsequent cryosectioning (± 90 nm) on a Leica EM FCS Cryo-Microtoom. The ultrathin sections were stained with anti-annexin A5 antibody (Hyphen Biomed) and protein A-conjugated with 10 nm gold (a kind gift of Dr. G. Postuma, University Medical Center Utrecht, Department of Cell Biology), washed with PBS containing 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin, postfixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, rinsed in ice-cold 1.8% methylcellulose, 0.4% uranylacetate, and stained in ice-cold 1.8% methylcellulose, 0.4% uranylacetate for 5–10 min. The grids were air-dried and examined in a Philips CM 10 microscope at 80 keV. Transmission Cryoelectron Microscopy—Extruded phospholipid vesicles of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and cholesterol (molar ratio 63.3:3.3:33.3) were prepared by passing a mixture of 10 mm hand-shaken liposomes of the above composition at least three times through a 100-nm filter (Anotop 10, Whatman). The extruded vesicles were submitted to a mild hypotonic shock to obtain 100-nm diameter vesicles with a perfect spherical shape. Annexin A5 or M23 was added to the vesicles at a weight ratio of 1:4 in the absence of Ca2+ ions. At this ratio maximally 50% of the phospholipid surface can be covered with annexin A5 upon binding (15Andree H.A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Hauptmann R. Hemker H.C. Hermens W.T. Willems G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4923-4928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin A5 binding to the vesicles was achieved by adding Ca2+ ions to the mixture such that the final Ca2+ ion concentration was 2.5 mm, and the solution became hypertonic relative to the lumen of the vesicles. The vesicles were prepared for cryoelectron microscopy analysis on a Philips CM12 microscope (Philips) using the Vitrobot™ (36Frederick P.M. Hubert D.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—FRET was determined with FITC and Alexa568-labeled proteins as donors and acceptors, respectively. Mixtures of annexin A5-FITC:annexin A5:annexin A5-Alexa568 or M23-FITC:M23:M23-Alexa568 were prepared in ratios 100:100:0, 100:80:20, 100:60:40, 100:40:60, 100:20:80, and 100:0:100. Mixtures of annexin A5:annexin A5-Alexa568 or M23:M23-Alexa568 were prepared in ratios 200:0, 180:20, 160:40, 140:60, 120:80, and 100:100. These mixtures were incubated with M-PVA-12 beads (Chemagen), which were coated with a phospholipid layer consisting of 35% dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 20% dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, 10% dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and 35% cholesterol in Ca2+ buffer (22Boersma H.H. Stolk L.M. Kenis H. Deckers N.M. Vanderheyden J.L. Hofstra L. Heidendal G.A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The fluorescence bound to the beads was measured on a Coulter Epics XL-MLC™ flow cytometer. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI, arbitrary units) was calculated off-line for the Alexa568 signal in channel 3 (MFI-FL3). FRET was calculated as the MFI-FL3 of the mixtures containing FITC divided by MFI-FL3 of the mixtures without FITC. Atomic Force Microscopy—Atomic force microscopy studies were performed following an adaptation of a described procedure (23Reviakine I.I. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Supported lipid bilayers of egg-phosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and cholesterol (46:20:34) were made on mica with the vesicle fusion method (24Rinia H.A. Snel M.M. van der Eerden J.P. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The presence of a bilayer could be verified by the detection of pinholes in the bilayer. The bilayers were incubated for up to 3 h with the wild type annexin A5 or the M23 (final protein concentrations 15 μg ml-1). Samples were imaged with a Nanoscope III using NP probes (both Digital Instruments) with an estimated spring constant of 0.06 n m-1. Imaging was done in contact mode in fluid exerting low force (∼100 pN). All samples were made and imaged in Hepes buffer (10 mm, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Images were low pass-filtered and/or flattened using the Nanoscope software. Annexin A5 Is Internalized via a PtdSer-dependent Pathway during Apoptosis—Apoptosis is characterized by membrane dynamics, including the exposure of PtdSer, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation. Surface expression of PtdSer can be measured with fluorescently labeled annexin A5 and starts rapidly after the onset of apoptosis (4Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Short incubations of anti-Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells with annexin A5-Oregon Green result in plasma membrane staining of early apoptotic cells, massively blebbing apoptotic cells, and apoptotic bodies (Fig. 1a). We observed that co-incubation of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas and annexin A5 changed the apoptotic membrane dynamics such that apoptotic body formation was inhibited. This inhibition depends on the annexin A5 dose and its ability to bind to PtdSer, because its non-binding mutant M1234 was without effect (Fig. 1b). Co-incubation of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas and annexin A5 did not affect other parts of the apoptotic program such as caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1c), PtdSer expression (Fig. 1d), DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1e), and ROCK-1 activation (Fig. 1f). The latter is involved in membrane blebbing, which precedes apoptotic body formation (25Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Inspection of the co-incubated Jurkat cells with CSLM and transmission electron microscopy revealed apoptotic cells that had internalized annexin A5 in translucent vesicles of various sizes (Fig. 2, a and b). We demonstrated that these vesicular structures are endocytic vesicles and not part of an open cannicular system by (i) washing the cells with EDTA and (ii) incubating them shortly with annexin A5-Oregon Green prior to CSLM analysis. This procedure neither removed annexin A5-Alexa568 from the vesicular structure nor resulted in the co-localization of annexin A5-Alexa568 and annexin A5-Oregon Green. The latter bound to the plasma membrane only. We concluded that annexin A5 is taken up in endocytic vesicles via a PtdSer-dependent mechanism. On the basis of our results so far, we reasoned that annexin A5 first binds to PtdSer expressing membrane patches prone to become blebs and second induces their invagination and budding.Fig. 2Annexin A5 is internalized via a PtdSer-dependent pathway during apoptosis. a, CSLM of anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells in the presence of 20 μg ml-1 annexin A5-Alexa568. b, immunoelectron microscopy of anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells in the presence of 20 μg ml-1 annexin A5. Immunolabeling was performed with anti-annexin A5 antibody and protein A conjugated with 10 nm gold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A Novel Pinocytic Pathway Internalizes Annexin A5 into Cells Executing Apoptosis—The size distribution of the annexin A5 endocytic vesicles suggests that the uptake is a macropinocytic process. This process is preceded by membrane ruffling and dependent on the polymerization of actin (26Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). We never observed membrane ruffling when Jurkat cells were co-incubated with anti-Fas and annexin A5. The staining of F-actin with phalloidin-TRITC revealed the presence of an actin coat around the annexin A5-containing vesicles (Fig. 3, a–c), suggesting the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton. Latrunculin B (Sigma), an inhibitor of actin polymerization, did not prevent the uptake of annexin A5 in endocytic vesicles (Fig. 3d). These vesicles remained localized underneath the plasma membrane indicating that actin polymerization is involved in intracellular trafficking but is not required for invagination and budding. The actomyosin contractile apparatus is involved in bleb formation during apoptosis via ROCK-1 activation (25Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Y-27632 (Tocris), an inhibitor of ROCK-1, did not inhibit the internalization of annexin A5-Alexa568 (Fig. 3e). Instead, ROCK-1 inhibition led to the formation of large annexin A5-containing vesicles suggesting that the actomyosin counteracts annexin A5-induced internalization thereby limiting vesicle size. Co-incubation of Jurkat cells having colchicines (Sigma) disrupted microtubules with anti-Fas, and annexin A5-Alexa568 resulted in annexin A5-containing vesicles that remained attached to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3f), indicating that intracellular trafficking depends on microtubules. Taken together our data showed that annexin A5 is internalized through a process that differs mechanistically from macropinocytosis. Two-dimensional Crystallization of Annexin A5 Is the Driving Force for Internalization—On basis of our results hitherto we reasoned that annexin A5 reverses membrane fission from blebbing into invagination. Because the annexin A5-PtdSer complex has no transmembrane orientation, direct intracellular signaling by this complex could be ruled out to be the cause for this reversion. Therefore, we started to look for an explanation on a nanomechanical basis. The tertiary structure of annexin A5 shows that its phospholipid binding side has a convex shape (27Huber R. Romisch J. Paques E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). When bound to the membrane annexin A5 forms trimers of which each monomer retains the convex shape at its phospholipid binding side (19Oling F. Santos J.S. Govorukhina N. Mazeres-Dubut C. Bergsma-Schutter W. Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Huber R. Schneider M. Mayr I. Romisch J. Paques E.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the trimers bend the membrane and provide the driving force for the reversion of membrane movement. To test the hypothesis we generated the annexin A5 mutant M23 (21Mira J.P. Dubois T. Oudinet J.P. Lukowski S. Russo-Marie F. Geny B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10474-10482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which by prediction from the available structural data (19Oling F. Santos J.S. Govorukhina N. Mazeres-Dubut C. Bergsma-Schutter W. Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Huber R. Romisch J. Paques E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) binds to PtdSer but lacks the ability to form trimers. Using a novel FRET assay we showed that annexin A5 but not M23 develops FRET when bound to a phospholipid surface (Fig. 4a). Atomic force microscopic analysis of phospholipid-bound annexin A5 and M23 revealed the ordered array formation of the former and the disordered organization of the latter (Fig. 4b). The convex shape of phospholipid-bound annexin A5 trimers was demonstrated to induce invagination of part of the membrane using large unilamellar vesicles. Structures with typically invaginated cups were obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 4c). The thickness of both the cup membrane with a negative curvature (Fig. 4d, nc) and the outer membrane with a positive curvature (pc) were 4.96 ± 0.75 nm. Incubating these structures with annexin A5 at subsaturating conditions resulted in thicknesses of 9.57 ± 1.46 and 5.26 ± 0.76 nm for negative and positive curvature, respectively. This showed that the annexin A5 network bound to the membrane is bent with the convex shape of its phospholipid binding side. Incubation of the vesicles with M23 yielded thicknesses of 5.91 ± 0.96 and 5.66 ± 0.75 nm for negative and positive curvature, respectively. All together, it is evident that annexin A5 and not M23 organizes at the phospholipid surface in a bent network. Co-incubation of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas and M23 resulted in the generation of large surface blebs with M23 at the outside and F-actin at the inside (Fig. 4e). No intracellular vesicles containing M23 were observed. Summarizing these results, we demonstrated that annexin A5 opens a PtdSer-dependent novel portal of cell entry by bending the membrane inward into the cell through two-dimensional crystallization. Living Cells Bear a PtdSer-dependent Portal of Entry—The execution of apoptosis results in the surface expression of PtdSer, which functions as a determinant for the entry of annexin A5. To determine whether apoptosis is an essential element for internalization, we incubated HeLa cells that were not subjected to apoptotic stimuli with annexin A5-Alexa568. After 3 h of incubation more than 50% of the HeLa cells had internalized annexin A5 in vesicles of varying sizes, similar to those observed in apoptotic Jurkat cells (Fig. 5a). The internalization was not coupled to the execution of the apoptotic program because (i) Z-VAD-fmk (IDN 1529, Idun Pharmaceuticals) did not inhibit annexin A5 internalization, and (ii) the cells with internalized annexin A5 were viable (data not shown). Apart from this discrepancy viable HeLa cells share the modus operandi with Jurkat cells executing apoptosis concerning the entry of annexin A5 into the cell. Annexin A5 internalization is dependent on the PtdSer binding and two-dimensional crystallization properties of annexin A5, because HeLa cells did not internalize fluorescently labeled M1234 or M23. Furthermore, Latrunculin B did not inhibit the internalization of annexin A5. Both Latrunculin B and colchicine prevented the intracellular trafficking of the annexin A5 containing vesicles. Further examination of the pathway of uptake demonstrates that it differs from known portals of cell entry (26Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). Annexin A5 uptake occurs neither through fluid phase internalization (Fig. 5b) nor through clathrin- and caveolin-mediated entry (29Mundy D.I. Machleidt T. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4327-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, c and d). Taken together our data showed that both cells executing apoptosis and living tumor cells have the same PtdSer-dependent portals of cell entry. The Specificity of the Novel Portal of Cell Entry—To investigate further how mandatory the two-dimensional crystallization is for endocytosis, we used annexin A1. This annexin binds to PtdSer but does not form a two-dimensional protein network on the membrane surface (30Govorukhina N. Bergsma-Schutter W. Mazères-Dubut C. Mazères S. Drakopoulou E. Bystrykh L. Oling F. Mukhopadhyay A. Reviakine I. Laikee Him J. Brisson A. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Annexins: Biological Importance and Annexin-related Pathologies. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown2002: 40-58Google Scholar). Co-incubation of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas and annexin A1-Alexa568 results only in plasma membrane staining of the apoptotic Jurkat cells but not in the formation of endocytic vesicles typically seen with annexin A5 (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained with living HeLa cells. Interestingly, annexin A5 shuttles annexin A1 into the cell, demonstrating that this novel pathway leads to the internalization of proteins bound to or in the vicinity of surface-expressed PtdSer. The latter has been demonstrated for tissue factor, which is internalized in PtdSer-expressing cells by annexin A5. 2S. Ravassa, A. Bennaghmouch, H. Kenis, H. Van Genderen, T. Lindhout, T. Hackeng, J. Narula, L. Hofstra, and C. P. M. Reutelingsperger, submitted for publication. Plasma membrane dynamics during apoptosis include the expression of PtdSer at the cell surface and membrane blebbing. Both phenomena occur during apoptosis downstream of caspase-3 activation (4Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) but are regulated independently. PtdSer expression occurs under conditions wherein membrane blebbing is inhibited (25Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). With fluorescently labeled annexin A5 it was shown that membrane blebs have surface-expressed PtdSer, indicating that the PtdSer-expressing membrane patches are flexible and bendable. Recently, it was reported that annexin A5 inhibits apoptotic body formation by applying a physical constraint on the plasma membrane and inhibiting the apoptotic program (20Gidon-Jeangirard C. Hugel B. Holl V. Toti F. Laplanche J.L. Meyer D. Freyssinet J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5712-5718PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that annexin A5 inhibits apoptotic body formation, but it does so in our system without interfering with the key steps of the apoptotic program such as caspase-3 activation, PtdSer expression, ROCK-1 cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. Because the apoptotic body formation is downstream of membrane blebbing (25Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), the inhibitory mechanism may operate on membrane blebs. Our investigations into this phenomenon revealed the existence of an endocytic pathway that is activated by annexin A5 and surface-expressed PtdSer. We demonstrated that annexin A5 reverses the movement of the PtdSer-expressing membrane patch from blebbing into invagination. This results in vesicle formation and the intracellular trafficking of the endocytic vesicle (Fig. 7). From the experiments with M23 and annexin A1 we concluded that the process of invagination is driven nanomechanically by the formation of an annexin A5 two-dimensional crystal that bends the membrane, which is likely due to the bent shape of the trimer building blocks (19Oling F. Santos J.S. Govorukhina N. Mazeres-Dubut C. Bergsma-Schutter W. Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mechanism of membrane bending differs from that operating in clathrin-coated pits. Here, the insertion of proteins into the lipid layer pushes lipid head groups of one leaflet apart thereby inducing curvature of the bilayer (31Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). If annexin A5 would operate comparably it is expected that annexin A5 facilitates blebbing instead of inducing invagination. Therefore, it is concluded that annexin A5 binds extrinsically and molds the membrane patch according to the convex shape of its phospholipid binding side. The energy required for this action is likely released by the two-dimensional crystallization process. The size distribution of the annexin A5 containing endocytic vesicles suggests macropinocytosis rather than clathrin- or caveolin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis (26Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). Despite a morphological resemblance the two endocytic pathways are mechanistically distinct. Annexin A5-induced endocytosis is neither actin-driven nor preceded by membrane ruffling. Hence, we concluded that the PtdSer-expressing membrane patch forms a novel portal of cell entry, which is opened by annexin A5. The relevance of the annexin A5 endocytic pathway during apoptosis is debatable. Why should a cell determined to die be capable of activating endocytic pathways? An inspection of the time course revealed that the endocytic pathway can be activated early after the onset of apoptosis, likely as soon as the first PtdSer molecules appear at the surface. Because cell surface expression of PtdSer has been reported for viable cells (32Hammill A.K. Uhr J.W. Scheuermann R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33van den Eijnde S.M. van den Hoff M.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. van Heerde W.L. Henfling M.E. Vermeij-Keers C. Schutte B.

Reutelingsperger, unpublished observations. the annexin A5 endocytic pathway in apoptotic cells could be a remnant of the pinocytic capabilities of the living cell. In this paper we demonstrated the likelihood of this possibility by showing that the annexin A5 endocytic pathway exists in viable HeLa cells. The pathway in HeLa cells is dependent on PtdSer expression and annexin A5 crystallization and independent of membrane ruffling and actin polymerization. Furthermore, the pathway is distinct from clathrin- and caveolae-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis. In addition, we have strong indications that the pathway also exists in vivo in cardiomyocytes that express PtdSer reversibly on their surface because of a mild ischemia/reperfusion stress. 3H. Kenis, J. Narula, L. Hofstra, and C. P. M. Reutelingsperger, unpublished observations. The relevance of the annexin A5 endocytic pathway in living cells remains to be established. Its activation leads to the down-regulation of surface-expressed proteins such as the tissue factor.2 It may therefore play a role in the regulation of processes such as blood coagulation2 and phagocytosis. 4H. Kenis and C. P. M. Reutelingsperger, unpublished observations. The annexin A5 endocytic pathway is apparently not operative ubiquitously in healthy non-disturbed tissues (17van den Eijnde S.M.

The reported cases of reversible PtdSer expression point toward situations of mild stress such as hypoxia in tumors and the transient ischemic heart that causes reversible PtdSer expression. Although its physiological relevance needs to be investigated, the annexin A5 endocytic pathway already offers an attractive mechanism for targeted delivery and cell entry of drugs designed to kill (tumor cells) or to rescue (ischemic/reperfused cardiomyocytes)."

https://openalex.org/W2055085422,"We have identified a novel mechanism of cross-talk between cell signaling and metabolic pathways, whereby the signaling kinase p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) binds to, phosphorylates and enhances the enzymatic activity of phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM), an important regulatory enzyme in cellular glucose utilization and energy homeostasis. Pak1 and PGM were colocalized in model cell systems and showed functional interactions in a physiological setting. Strong direct interaction of PGM with Pak1 but not Pak2, Pak3, or Pak4 was observed. PGM binding was within 75-149 amino acids (aa) of Pak1, while Pak1 binding to PGM was in the N-terminal 96 aa. Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of PGM selectively on threonine 466 significantly increased PGM enzymatic activity and could be blocked by transfection with a dominant-negative Pak1 expression vector and by Pak1-specific small inhibitory RNA. Stable transfection of PGM into PGM-deficient K562 leukemia cells further demonstrated the role of Pak1 in regulating PGM activity. The results presented here provide new evidence that the cell signaling kinase Pak1 is a novel regulator of glucose metabolism through its phosphorylation and regulation of PGM activity. These findings suggest a new mechanism whereby growth factor signaling may coordinately integrate metabolic regulation with established signaling functions of cell cycle regulation and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2167941377,"Mechanical stress to bone plays a critical role in maintaining bone mass and strength. However, the molecular mechanism of mechanical stress-induced bone formation is not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that FosB and its spliced variant ΔFosB, which is known to increase bone mass by stimulating bone formation in vivo, is rapidly induced by mechanical loading in mouse hind limb bone in vivo and by fluid shear stress (FSS) in mouse calvarial osteoblasts in vitro both at the mRNA and protein levels. FSS induction of FosB/ΔFosB gene expression was dependent on gadlinium-sensitive Ca2+ influx and subsequent activation of ERK1/2. Analysis of the mouse FosB/ΔFosB gene upstream regulatory region with luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that the FosB/ΔFosB induction by FSS occurred at the transcriptional level and was conferred by a short fragment from –603 to –327. DNA precipitation assays and DNA decoy experiments indicated that ERK-dependent activation of CREB binding to a CRE/AP-1 like element (designated “CRE2”) at the position of –413 largely contributed to the transcriptional effects of FSS. These results suggest that ΔFosB participates in mechanical stress-induced intracellular signaling cascades that activate the osteogenic program in osteoblasts.

Mechanical stress to bone plays a critical role in maintaining bone mass and strength. Reduced mechanical loading because of long-term bed rest or immobilization, or microgravity conditions in space, has been shown to cause significant bone loss and mineral changes. Evidence from human and animal studies has indicated that impaired bone formation significantly contributes to such unloading associated osteoporosis (1Morey E.R. Baylink D.J. Science. 1978; 201: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 2Schneider V. Oganov V. LeBlanc A. Rakmonov A. Taggart L. Bakulin A. Huntoon C. Grigoriev A. Varonin L.

Bone (N.Y.). 2000; 26: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is an important task for us to elucidate the mechanism by which mechanical loading induces bone formation to understand the pathophysiology and to establish an effective treatment of osteoporosis caused by reduced mechanical loading.Bone cells have the ability to sense mechanical loading to activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways and transcription of various genes. Although the molecular device and the cellular repertoire in bone responsible for sensing such mechanical stimuli in vivo has not been precisely determined, it has been proposed that mechanotransduction in bone is mediated by changes in extracellular fluid flow caused by dynamic loading, which engenders fluid shear stress (FSS) 1The abbreviations used are: FSS, fluid shear stress; AP-1, activator protein-1; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; COX, cyclooxygenase; SRE, serum response element; RT, reverse transcription; CDODN, circular dumbbell decoy oligonucleotides; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester; MEM, minimal essential medium.1The abbreviations used are: FSS, fluid shear stress; AP-1, activator protein-1; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; COX, cyclooxygenase; SRE, serum response element; RT, reverse transcription; CDODN, circular dumbbell decoy oligonucleotides; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester; MEM, minimal essential medium. to bone cells, particularly osteocytes that are a terminally differentiated form of osteoblasts embedded in calcified bone (4Burr D.B.

Consistently, FSS has been shown to elicit a divergent array of intracellular signaling pathways including intracellular calcium rise, activation of enzymes such as protein kinase B/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase family, and activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 (activator protein-1) and CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein) in cells of the osteoblast lineage (6Mikuni-Takagaki Y. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1999; 17: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Nomura S. Takano-Yamamoto T. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Ehrlich P.J. Lanyon L.E. Osteoporos. Int. 2002; 13: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Downstream of such signaling events is induction of various gene expression including extracellular matrix proteins such as type I collagen and osteopontin, and growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-I (7Nomura S. Takano-Yamamoto T. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms as well as relevance to bone formation of such gene induction by mechanical stress in bone cells are largely unknown.One of the earliest transcriptional events caused by mechanical loading in bone cells is induction of c-Fos (9Lean J.M. Mackay A.G. Chow J.W. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E937-E945PubMed Google Scholar), a protooncogene that belongs to the AP-1 transcription factor family consisting of three Fos and four Jun family members. As a prototype of “immediate early genes,” c-Fos expression is known to be rapidly and transiently induced by various stimuli including serum and growth factors (10Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar, 11Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Induction of c-Fos expression by mechanical force has also been demonstrated in non-bone cells such as cardiac, muscle, and endothelial cells (13Li C. Xu Q. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because mechanical loading induces several AP-1-responsive genes presumably involved in bone formation, c-Fos has been assumed to play a role in induction of such AP-1 target genes, thereby contributing to mechanical stress-induced bone formation. However, ubiquitous overexpression of c-Fos in transgenic mice resulted in development of osteosarcoma without evidence for increased bone formation (14Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, although c-Fos may stimulate proliferation and/or survival of the osteoblast lineage cells, it is not able to induce bone formation when overexpressed alone in bone cells.Another “immediate early gene” type member of the Fos family is FosB. Recently, transgenic mice overexpressing ΔFosB (15Mumberg D. Lucibello F.C. Schuermann M. Muller R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Yen J. Wisdom R.M.

Cell. 1991; 64: 751-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), a short splicing isoform of FosB gene, have been reported to exhibit a progressive increase in bone mass because of enhanced bone formation (18Sabatakos G. Sims N.A. Chen J. Aoki K. Kelz M.B. Amling M. Bouali Y. Mukhopadhyay K. Ford K. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Expression of ΔFosB was observed within the osteoblast lineage and regulated in a differentiation-associated manner, and the effects of ΔFosB overexpression on osteoblasts appeared to be cell-autonomous and reversible (19Kveiborg M. Chiusaroli R. Sims N.A. Wu M. Sabatakos G. Horne W.C. Baron R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4304-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Sims N.A. Sabatakos G. Chen J.S. Kelz M.B. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Bone (N.Y.). 2002; 30: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results indicate that expression of ΔFosB alone is sufficient to induce bone formation, and further imply that ΔFosB may be involved in signaling pathways induced by osteogenic stimuli such as mechanical loading.In the present study, we investigated a potential role of ΔFosB in mechanical stress-induced bone formation. The results indicated that FosB/ΔFosB gene expression in bone cells was induced by mechanical stress both in vitro and in vivo. The induction occurred in a manner dependent on gadolinium (Gd3+)-sensitive Ca2+ influx and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) but independent of prostaglandin production, and involved a transcriptional mechanism with a major contribution of CREB. Our results suggest that ΔFosB acts as a downstream effector of mechanical loading and participates in mechanical stress-induced osteogenic signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—A selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, JTE-522 (21Matsushita M.

Indomethacin, nifedipine (L-type Ca2+ channel blocker), BAPTA-AM (intracellular Ca2+ chelator), A23187 (calcium ionophore), bucladesine (dibutyryl cAMP), U0126 (ERK inhibitor), and SB203580 (p38 kinase inhibitor) were purchased from Calbiochem. pAP1-Luc, pCRE-Luc, and pSRE-Luc plasmids, which are cis-reporter plasmids containing tandem consensus AP-1-binding sites, CRE (cAMP-response element), and c-Fos-derived SRE (serum response element), respectively, were from Invitrogen. All chemicals for dual-luciferase reporter assays were from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibody against FosB/ΔFosB was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against ERK1/2 and activated (phospho-) ERK1/2 were from Promega, and anti-CREB and phospho-CREB antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All DNA modifying enzymes used in this study were from New England Biolabs Inc. and the other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.Experimental Animals—For in vivo experiments, 7–9-week-old ICR male mice were purchased from Charles River Japan (Tokyo, Japan), and were acclimatized for 1 week. The body weight of the mice ranged from 20 to 25 g. All mice were allowed free access to food and water, housed in stainless cages in an air-conditioned environment (temperature: 24–25 °C, humidity: 50–55%) that was illuminated from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. The experimental protocols in the current study have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Oversight Committee according to the guideline principles in the Care and Use of Animals. Mechanical unloading by tail suspension and the following reloading was performed according to the procedures described before (23Sakata T. Sakai A. Tsurukami H. Okimoto N. Okazaki Y. Ikeda S.

Bone (N.Y.). 1998; 22: 89S-93SCrossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Mice were anesthetized with ether and unloaded by suspending tails with the hind limbs being lifted off from the ground. After tail suspension for 4 days, mice were forced to run in rotating cages for the indicated times for reloading, sacrificed, and analyzed for gene expression.Cell Culture—Primary osteoblasts were prepared from calvariae of newborn ICR mice by sequential digestion with 0.1% (w/v) type IA collagenase and 0.2% (w/v) dispase as previously described (25Inoue D. Santiago P. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25386-25393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The osteoblasts were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum) (Sigma), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) for 48 h. Before induction experiments, 1 × 105/ml osteoblasts were plated on culture dishes, grown to 70–80% confluence, and serum-deprived in α-MEM with 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. For mechanical loading in vitro, osteoblasts were exposed to FSS by placing 6-well culture dishes on a horizontal shaking apparatus fixed inside the culture incubator. All the experiments in the present study were performed at 100–120 rpm. The shear stress force in our system was estimated to be slightly less than that produced by 200 rpm with a cone viscometer, which was ∼2 pascal at the edge (26Sakai K. Mohtai M. Shida J. Harimaya K. Benvenuti S. Brandi M.L. Kukita T. Iwamoto Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and thus theoretically stayed within the physiological range.Adenovirus Infection—A recombinant adenoviral vector for constitutively active MEK1 (MEKCA) was a kind gift from Dr. Sakae Tanaka (University of Tokyo). Primary osteoblasts at passage two were infected with MEKCA adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection varying from 0 to 100. At 48 h after infection, cells were harvested and examined for expression of FosB/ΔFosB and other proteins by Western blot analysis.RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from tibia and femur of the mice or cultured primary osteoblasts using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen), and mRNA expression for various genes was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays. For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II RT™ (Invitrogen) and random primers (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). One of a 20-μl RT reaction was used for PCR analysis. Primer sets used for amplification were as follows: sense, 5′-aaaaggcagagctggagtcgg-3′, and antisense, 5′-tgtacgaagggctaacaacgg-3′ for mouse FosB, which amplifies both the short spliced ΔFosB isoform and the long FosB transcripts; and sense, 5′-tgtcttcaccaccatggagaagg-3′, and antisense, 5′-gtggatgcagggatgatgttctg-3′, for mouse GAPDH gene. The PCR cycle numbers were 28 for FosB/ΔFosB and 22 for GAPDH, which were determined so that quantitative information was not lost. Amplified products were separated on 1.5–2.0% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization. For the RNase protection assay, a fragment of mouse FosB cDNA (nucleotides 1480–2051) was subcloned into pBlueScript SKII(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resultant plasmid was linearized and purified with Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and in vitro transcribed to generate a cRNA probe using the MAXIscript in Vitro Transcription Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). A control template for mouse β-actin was purchased from Ambion. RNase protection assays were performed using the RPAII Kit (Ambion) as previously described (27Inoue D. Reid M. Lum L. Kratzschmar J. Weskamp G. Myung Y.M. Baron R. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4180-4187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA samples were incubated with [α-32P]UTP-labeled cRNA probes at 42 °C for 18 h and digested with an RNase A/T1 mixture. Non-digested RNA was precipitated, separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, transferred to 3MM Whatman filter paper, dried, and autoradiographed.Protein Analysis—Preparation of nuclear extracts was described previously (25Inoue D. Santiago P. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25386-25393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 × 107 cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 10 mm Na2MoO4) for 10 min, vortexed for 10 s, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 s. The pellet was resuspended in NLB buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 10 mm Na2MoO4), placed on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was saved as nuclear extracts. Total cell lysates were prepared using 1× Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclear extracts and total cell lysates were stored at –80 °C until use. For Western blot analysis, 30 μg of protein was separated on a 5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was rinsed and blocked with 5% nonfat skim milk or 2% bovine serum albumin (fraction V from Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature, blotted sequentially with primary antibodies, then with a horseradish-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, and the protein bands were visualized with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Cloning of the Mouse FosB Gene Promoter—Fragments of mouse FosB gene (GenBank™ number AF093624) upstream regulatory region from nucleotides –1000 to +307 (1.0K), –603 to +307 (0.6K), and –327 to +307 (0.3K) (with the transcription start site being numbered +1) were cloned from a mouse genomic library (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) by PCR with the following primer sets: sense, 5′-acgggtaccttagtctccggttcggagaac-3′, and antisense, 5′-acgaagcttttagtctccggttcggagaac-3′, for 1.0K; sense, 5′-ctaattgcgtcacaggaactcc-3′, and antisense, acgaagcttttagtctccggttcggagaac-3′ for 0.6K; and sense, 5′-agcggtacccagggtcacactatgggcaggt-3′, and antisense, 5′-acgaagcttttagtctccggttcggagaa-3′, for 0.3K. PCR products were purified, digested with KpnI/XhoI (1.0K and 0.3K) or SmaI/XhoI) (0.6K), and subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI), which lacks eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences. From the luciferase vector containing the longest 1.0-kb promoter, a series of mutant plasmids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (STRATAGENE) with mutagenic primers including 5′-ccttatatCC-3′ for SRE mutation (g547c and g548c) and 5′-tgGCAca-3′ for CRE2 mutation (c556g, g557c, and t558a). All the constructs were verified by sequencing.Dual Luciferase Assay—Osteoblasts were seeded in 6-well culture plates at 50% confluence and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 18–24 h, the cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of chimeric luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.025 μg of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmids (Promega) using GenePorter 2 Transfection Reagents (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) in Opti-MEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. At 6 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by 2 ml of Opti-MEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The transfected cells were then treated with various reagents and/or exposed to FSS by placing the culture plates on a shaking apparatus at 100 to 120 rpm. For dual luciferase assays, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 100 μl of passive cell lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured with luminometer (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) by mixing 50 μl of luciferase substrate solution (Promega) with 10 μl of cell lysates. Transcriptional activity was normalized for Renilla luciferase activity or protein concentrations.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as previously described (25Inoue D. Santiago P. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25386-25393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and DNA polymerase I fragment (Klenow) (New England Biolabs). The labeled probes were purified by Sephadex G-25 columns (Quick Spin Columns, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), diluted with distilled water, and 3 × 104 cpm was incubated with nuclear extracts (10 μg) and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 20 μl of 1/2 × NLB buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. For competition analysis, a hundred times molar excess of cold oligonucleotide probes were added to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction. Resolution was accomplished by electrophoresing 15 μl of the reaction mixture on 4.5 to 5.0% polyacrylamide gels using 0.25× TBE buffer (22.3 mm Tris-HCl, 22.3 mm boric acid, and 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were then transferred onto 3MM filter paper and dried, and protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography.DNA Precipitation Assay—Biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing three tandem repeats of SRE/CRE2 (–437 to –401) or CRE1 (–488 to –461) sequences were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides followed by ethanol precipitation. The annealed probes (100 pmol) were incubated with 100 μg of nuclear extracts and 15 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) in 500 μl of NLB100 buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 20 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm VO4 for 4 °C with gentle agitation, and then with streptavidine-conjugated magnetic beads (Magnotex-SA, TaKaRa, Japan) at 4 °C for 30 min. DNA-protein complexes bound to magnetic beads were collected by placing the reaction tubes on a magnetic stand and washed with ice-cold NLB100 buffer for four times. After the final wash, beads were collected and resupended in 2× sample buffer. Sequence-specific DNA-bound proteins were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by Western blotting. For competition analysis, 100 times molar excess of non-labeled biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were added to the DNA-protein reactions.Decoy Oligonucleotides—An SRE/CRE2 “circular dumbbell” decoy oligonucleotide (CDODN) (28Ahn J.D.

This structure has been demonstrated to confer resistance to endogenous nucleases (29Lee I.K. Ahn J.D. Kim H.S. Park J.Y. Lee K.U. Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As controls, we also synthesized mutant CDODNs including: Scramble, 5′-taacgactcggtagtttttttctaccgagtcgttaattgcctgcggcagtggatgtttttttcatccactgccgcaggcaat-3′; SREmt, 5′-ataaCCagctcgcctttttttggcgagctGGttatatggctaattgcgtcacaggtttttttcctgtgacgcaattagccat-3′; and CRE2mt, 5′-ataaggagctcgcctttttttggcgagctccttatatggctaattgGCAcacaggtttttttcctgtgTGCcaattagccat-3′. After self-annealing and ligation, the CDODNs were introduced into osteoblasts by GenePorter 2 Transfection Reagents according to the manufacturer's instruction.RESULTSIn Vivo Mechanical Forces and in Vitro FSS to Osteoblasts Induce FosB/ΔFosB Gene Expression at Both the mRNA and Protein Levels—We first investigated whether or not expression of the FosB/ΔFosB gene in bone is induced by mechanical loading in vivo. Seven- to 9-week-old ICR male mice were tail suspended for 4 days to reduce the background expression, and then mechanically reloaded in rotating cages. As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of (long) FosB and ΔFosB mRNA in tibiae and femurs was undetectable in tail-suspended mice, but was induced as early as 30 min after mechanical reloading and reached the maximum within 2 h. In the in vitro experiments shown in Fig. 1B, primary osteoblasts derived from newborn mouse calvariae were subjected to FSS on a shaking apparatus. As a result, we observed that FosB/ΔFosB mRNA was induced by FSS in primary osteoblasts, recapitulating the in vivo induction in reloaded mice. These results are consistent with an assumption that the in vivo mechanical forces caused FSS to bone cells of the osteoblast lineage, leading to increased expression of FosB/ΔFosB. To confirm that the induction of FosB/ΔFosB mRNA by FSS leads to an increase in the amount of their protein products, nuclear extracts were obtained from cells that had been exposed to FSS and were analyzed for FosB/ΔFosB protein expression by Western blotting. The results indicated that FosB (50 kDa) and ΔFosB (32 kDa) proteins were both induced either by mechanical loading in vivo or FSS in vitro in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). These findings were similarly observed in other osteoblastic cell lines such as a murine calvarial cell line, MC3T3-E1, and a murine bone marrow stromal cell line, ST-2 (data not shown). Therefore, induction of FosB/ΔFosB gene expression by mechanical stress occurs at both the mRNA and protein levels in cells of the osteoblast lineage.Induction of FosB/ΔFosB mRNA Is Independent of Prostaglandin Production—Previous reports suggest that prostaglandins are important mediators of mechanical stress-induced bone formation. Mechanical stress has been shown to cause activation of a constitutive type of prostaglandin G/H synthase (COX-1) and transcriptional up-regulation of an inducible isoform (COX-2) (8Ehrlich P.J.

Rutledge S.J. Rodan G.A. Bone (N. Y.). 1997; 20: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether FSS-induced FosB/ΔFosB expression is mediated by prostaglandins, tail-suspended mice were subcutaneously injected with indomethacin, a general COX inhibitor (both COX-1 and COX-2), prior to reloading, and FosB/ΔFosB mRNA induction in tibiae and femurs was analyzed by RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, FosB/ΔFosB mRNA induction was not blocked by indomethacin. Similarly, pretreatment with either indomethacin or a selective COX-2 inhibitor, JTE-522, had no major effects on FSS-induced FosB/ΔFosB expression in osteoblasts in vitro (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that mechanical stress-induced FosB/ΔFosB induction was independent of prostaglandin production both in vivo and in vitro.Fig. 2Induction of FosB/ΔFosB mRNA is independent of prostaglandin production.A, 7–9-week-old ICR male mice were first tail suspended for 4 days and orally given 10 mg/kg of indomethacin or vehicle. After 1 h, mice were reloaded in a rotating cage for 30 min and sacrificed, and expression of FosB/ΔFosB and β-actin mRNA in tibiae and femurs was analyzed by RNase protection assay. B, mouse calvarial osteoblasts were pretreated with 1 mm indomethacin or a selective COX-2 inhibitor, JTE-522, 30 min prior to FSS. Cells were then exposed to FSS for 30 min, and mRNA expression of FosB/ΔFosB and GAPDH as an internal control was examined by RT-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FSS-induced FosB/ΔFosB mRNA Expression Is Dependent on ERK—We then attempted to delineate the intracellular signaling pathways leading to FosB/ΔFosB induction.

Following transfection of HeLa cells with plasmids expressing CFP- or YFP-TRAF fusion proteins, constitutive homotypic association of TRAF2, -3, and -5 was observed, as well as heterotypic association of TRAF1-TRAF2 and TRAF3-TRAF5. A novel heterotypic association between TRAF2 and -3 was detected and confirmed by immunoprecipitation in Ramos B cells that constitutively express both TRAF2 and -3. Experiments employing deletion mutants of TRAF2 and TRAF3 revealed that this heterotypic interaction minimally involved the TRAF-C domain of TRAF3 as well as the TRAF-N domain and zinc fingers 4 and 5 of TRAF2. A novel flow cytometric FRET analysis utilizing a two-step approach to achieve linked FRET from CFP to YFP to HcRed established that TRAF2 and -3 constitutively form homo- and heterotrimers. The functional importance of TRAF2-TRAF3 heterotrimerization was demonstrated by the finding that TRAF3 inhibited spontaneous NF-κB, but not AP-1, activation induced by TRAF2. Ligation of CD40 on Ramos B cells by recombinant CD154 caused TRAF2 and TRAF3 to dissociate, whereas overexpression of TRAF3 in Ramos B cells inhibited CD154-induced TRAF2-mediated activation of NF-κB.

The functional significance of TRAF2 and -3 in immune responses mediated by one or more of these TNF receptor superfamily molecules was revealed by experiments with mice that were genetically altered in expression of TRAF2 or -3.

Of note, mice expressing a dominant negative form of TRAF2 exhibited an expanded B cell compartment that was evidenced by splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy (21Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A.

Importantly, a number of reports have indicated that TRAF3 inhibits NF-κB activation induced by TRAF2 following engagement of TNF receptor superfamily members such as CD40/TNFRSF5 (29Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and OX40/TNFRSF4 (30Takaori-Kondo A. Hori T. Fukunaga K. Morita R. Kawamata S. Uchiyama T.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 5997-6005Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism of this observation has not been delineated. However, overexpression of wild-type TRAF3 has been shown to inhibit TRAF2-induced NF-κB activation (30Takaori-Kondo A. Hori T. Fukunaga K. Morita R. Kawamata S. Uchiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, proteolysis of TRAF3 by a pepstatin A inhibitable mechanism enhanced CD40-mediated NF-κB activation (32Annunziata C.M. Safiran Y.J. Irving S.G. Kasid U.N. Cossman J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TRAF2-induced degradation of TRAF3 enhanced NF-κB activation (33Hostager B.S. Haxhinasto S.A. Rowland S.L. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45382-45390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). By contrast, expression of an alternatively spliced form of TRAF3 has been shown to activate NF-κB (34van Eyndhoven W.G. Gamper C.J. Cho E. Mackus W.J. Lederman S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Gamper C. Omene C.O. van Eyndhoven W.G. Glassman G.D. Lederman S. Hum. Immunol. 2001; 62: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that a complex role for TRAF2 and TRAF3 in the regulation of NF-κB, but the precise molecular mechanism has not been delineated. Importantly, no direct physical interaction between TRAF2 and TRAF3 has been documented to date. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether functional inhibition of TRAF2-induced NF-κB activation was mediated by a direct interaction between TRAF2 and -3. Experiments utilizing one- and two-step FRET performed by confocal microscopy or flow cytometry clearly demonstrated that TRAF3 directly associates with TRAF2 and inhibits TRAF2-induced NF-κB, but not AP-1, activation. Plasmids—Plasmids that encode CFP- or YFP-fused to TRAF3 or -5 have been described previously (36He L. Bradrick T.D. Karpova T.S. Wu X. Fox M.H. Fischer R. McNally J.G. Knutson J.R. Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 53A: 39-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the fragments containing TRAF3 were cloned into the appropriate sites of HcRed-C1 to prepare HcRed-TRAF3. Plasmids containing human cDNAs encompassing the complete open reading frames of hTRAF1 and hTRAF6 have been previously described (37Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P.

Cytometry. 2003; 55A: 71-85Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To prepare CFP or YFP fusion protein constructs, the relevant PCR fragment was amplified using a pair of oligonucleotides (TRAF1-EcoRI top, 5′-TCGAATTCTATGGCCTCCACCAGCTCAGGCAGC-3′ and TRAF1-BamHI bottom, 5′-ATTGGATCCCTAAGTGCTGGTCTCCACAATGC-3′; TRAF6-BglII top, 5′-CTCAGATCTCGAATGAGTCTGCTAAACTGTGAA-3′ and TRAF6-HindIII bottom, 5′-TCGAAGCTTGCTATACCCCTGCATCAGTA-3′) and then cloned into the appropriate sites of CFP-C1 or YFP-C1 vectors (Clontech, San Diego, CA). Plasmids for human TRAF2 were directly amplified from a thymus cDNA library, according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a pair of oligonucleotides (TRAF2-BamHI top, 5′-CTCGGATCCATGGCTGCAGCTAGCGTG-3′ and TRAF2-Hind III bottom, 5′-AACAAGCTTAGTTAGAGCCCTGTCAGGTC-3′). Afterward, these fragments were cut with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into their compatible sites in CFP-C1, YFP-C1, and HcRed-C1 (Clontech) to prepare CFP-TRAF2, YFP-TRAF2 (38He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55A: 71-85Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and HcRed, respectively. The same PCR fragments for all TRAFs were cloned into His-tagged pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to prepare His-TRAF2, His-TRAF3, His-TRAF5, and His-TRAF6 plasmids. A plasmid that encodes a FRET-negative control (CFP-TRAF2TRAF-YFP) has been previously described (36He L. Bradrick T.D. Karpova T.S. Wu X. Fox M.H. Fischer R. McNally J.G. Knutson J.R. Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 53A: 39-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The NF-κB and AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmids were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Plasmid Transfection—HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Transient transfection was done with the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent into log-phase growing cells (Invitrogen). Routinely, transfected cells were cultured overnight and then analyzed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Any samples involving TRAF6 transfection were incubated in the presence of 30 μm lactacystin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or 25 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) and were processed for the assays at 3 h post-transfection. The EBV-negative B cell line, Ramos/R2G6, was cultured as described previously (24Grammer A.C. Swantek J.L. McFarland R.D. Miura Y. Geppert T. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1183-1193PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Sixteen h post-transfection, cells were lysed in hyper-salt on ice. Cell extracts were examined by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for GFP (Roche Diagnostics) or individual TRAF molecules (TRAF1, -3, -5, and -6, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA; TRAF2, BD Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA). Immunoprecipitation was performed with Ramos cells to determine whether there are endogenous TRAF2/TRAF3 complexes. Briefly, affinity purified rabbit anti-TRAF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or anti-rabbit IgG1 was cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (Roche) beads with dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). Twenty-five μg of protein from whole cell extracts from Ramos B cells were mixed with beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C in buffer BC-100 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were then washed four times with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100 and subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. FRET Detection by Flow Cytometry—All cytometric data were collected using a FACS DiVa (Digital Vantage SE.; BD Biosciences). The optical configuration for FRET measurement (FRET1) between CFP and YFP has been described previously (36He L. Bradrick T.D. Karpova T.S. Wu X. Fox M.H. Fischer R. McNally J.G. Knutson J.R. Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 53A: 39-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55A: 71-85Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the argon ion 488-nm laser line at 150 milliwatts and the krypton ion UV 407-nm laser line at 50 milliwatts were employed to excite the YFP and CFP, respectively. YFP signals were collected using a 546/10 nm band-pass filter in the primary laser pathway (laser 1). CFP signals were collected using a 460/20 nm band-pass filter in the third laser pathway (laser 3). FRET1 signals directly emitted from YFP during CFP → YFP FRET were collected using a 546/10-nm band-pass filter in the third laser pathway (UV1-FL7). To study FRET (FRET2) signals between YFP and HcRed, a 630/22-nm band-pass filter (FL8) was used to detect emission signals from HcRed in the primary laser pathway (laser 1), whereas HcRed was directly excited by the 568-nm line emitted from the spectrum laser at 50 milliwatts and its emission was monitored by the signals detected in the second pathway (laser 2) using a 610 LP filter (FL6). The detector in the UV1-FL7 position of the UV-laser pathway was also used to collect either two-step FRET signals emitted from HcRed during CFP → YFP → HcRed FRET using a 630/22-nm band-pass filter. All data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). FRET Detection by Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—The method employed has been described previously (37Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 38He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55A: 71-85Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 16 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on silicon-coated slides. Fixation does not change fluorescence protein localization and cellular morphology (Refs. 37Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar and 38He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55A: 71-85Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar; and data not shown). Any samples involving TRAF6 tranfection were cultured with 30 μm lacatacystin and fixed 3 h post-transfection. HeLa cells transfected with plasmids expressing CFP and YFP fusion proteins were examined routinely using a ×100 objective. Confocal microscopic images were obtained with the Carl Zeiss laser scanning microscope with LSM 510 software. An excitation wavelength of 458 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 to 500 nm were used for CFP, whereas an excitation wavelength of 514 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 to 545 nm were used for YFP. FRET was assessed and quantitated using an acceptor photobleaching method that was developed for laser-scanning confocal microscopy (37Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 38He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55A: 71-85Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The method assessed the extent of FRET by measuring the donor fluorescence before (Da) and after (D) photobleaching of the acceptor. The amount of energy transfer detected by confocal microscopy (FRETc) was calculated as the ratio of donor fluorescence in the presence or absence of acceptor: FRETc = D/Da. The ratio of D/Da equals or is less than 1.0 in the absence of FRET. If D/Da is >1.0, FRET is considered to have occurred (39Sharma N. Hewett J. Ozelius L.J. Ramesh V. McLean P.J. Breakefield X.O. Hyman B.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the D/Da ratio >1.0 is proportional to the proximity of the fluorophore. The ratio of D/Da was compared with the null hypothesis value of 1.0 by one group t-tests. Reporter Gene Assays and Flow Cytometry—For NF-κB and AP-1 reporter gene assays, HeLa cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent and a total of 4.5 μg of DNA (including 0.5 μg of the NF-κB- or the AP-1 luciferase reporter constructs) and 2 μg of pEYFP plasmid to monitor transfection efficiency and 2 μg of plasmid expressing YFP- or His-tagged TRAFs at about 60% confluence in 6-well plates in triplicate. For experiments to examine whether an interaction between TRAF2 and TRAF3 affected TRAF2-mediated NF-κB or AP-1 activation, HeLa cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the NF-κB- or AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmids and 2 or 5 μg of plasmids expressing YFP, YFP-TRAF2, or YFP-TRAF3, or 2 μg of YFP-TRAF2 plus 2 or 5 μg of YFP-TRAF3. Sixteen h post-transfection, cells were lysed with 300 μl of Promega lysis buffer. The luciferase activity of 10 μl of each lysate was measured using the Luciferase assay kit from Promega. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to YFP levels. Verification of the Functional Integrity of TRAF Fusion Proteins—The plasmids expressing fluorescent fusion proteins of each TRAF were prepared and transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Immunoblots were carried out with antibodies specific for the fluorescent tag as well as for the specific TRAF proteins to document correct expression of each TRAF fusion protein (Fig. 1, A-E). Each of the constructs was expressed and detected at the expected molecular mass. For each of the fusion proteins, except TRAF2, smaller molecular weight fragments were also detected. This was most marked for TRAF6, which was ubiquitinated within 3 h and completely degraded by 16 h post-transfection. Even when the cells were cultured in the presence of an inhibitor of the proteasome, lactacystin, only a small amount of TRAF6 was expressed at 16 h post-transfection. It is notable that HeLa cells expressed detectable levels of only two of the TRAF family members constitutively, TRAF2 and -5. Because of the relatively large size (27 kDa) of the fluorescent CFP or YFP tag fused to each TRAF, it was important to document that the TRAF fusion proteins were functionally intact. To accomplish this, plasmids were prepared that expressed TRAF proteins fused to a small His tag. As can been seen in Fig. 1F, overexpression of His or fluorescent fusion proteins of TRAF2 or -6 induced activation of NF-κB equivalently. FRET Reveals TRAF Domain-mediated Self-association of TRAF2, -3, and -5 in Living Cells—By confocal microscopy, TRAF fusion proteins were primarily expressed as aggregates in the cytosol (Fig. 2A, data not shown). Importantly, CFP- and YFP-tagged TRAFs localized comparably in cells. Homotypic association of TRAF2, -3, and -5, but not TRAF6, was detected in the cytosol of transfected cells by confocal FRET (Fig. 2, B and C; data not shown). Flow cytometric FRET also demonstrated homotypic association of TRAF2, -3, and -5 as well as weak, but reproducible homotypic association of TRAF6 (Fig. 2D). The ability of flow cytometry to detect homomers of TRAF6 is likely related to the enhanced sensitivity of flow cytometric FRET compared with confocal microscopic FRET (36He L. Bradrick T.D.

Absence of FRET was observed in cells transfected with a plasmid expressing CFP-TRAF2TRAF-YFP in which a structurally restricted linker of nearly 100 Å (TRAF domain from TRAF2) was inserted between CFP and YFP (Fig. 2D, row 4). Importantly, self-association of TRAFs was mediated by their respective TRAF domains as comparable FRET was detected between full-length YFP-TRAFs and CFP fusion proteins of the respective TRAF domains (Fig. 3). The FRET signal for self-association of full-length TRAFs or TRAF domains of each TRAF were not statistically significant implying that the TRAF domains account for all homotypic associations detected between these family members.Fig. 3The TRAF domain mediates homotypic association of TRAF2, -3, and -5. HeLa cells were cotransfected with YFP-TRAF2 and CFP-TRAF2TRAF, or YFP-TRAF3 and CFP-TRAF3TRAF, or YFP-TRAF5 and CFP-TRAF5TRAF and analyzed by confocal microscopic FRET.

To determine whether TRAF1-TRAF2 and TRAF3-TRAF5 heterotrimers could be detected in living cells, FRET was assessed in HeLa cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing CFP-TRAF1 and YFP-TRAF2 or CFP-TRAF3 and YFP-TRAF5. Along with its uniform distribution in the cytoplasm, CFP-TRAF1 co-localized with YFP-TRAF2 in punctate regions (data not shown). This close association was accompanied by positive FRET (Fig. 4). Similar results were noted for interactions between TRAF3 and -5 (Fig. 4). To determine whether TRAF2 interacted with other TRAFs, HeLa cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing CFP-TRAF2, along with plasmids expressing YFP-tagged TRAF3, -5, or -6 (Fig. 5A). TRAF2 colocalized with TRAF3, and FRET could be detected between TRAF2 and TRAF3 tagged with CFP and YFP, respectively (data not shown). By contrast, there was no direct interaction between TRAF2 and -5 although in some spreading cells they appeared to colocalize. FRET between TRAF2 and -6 was difficult to detect by confocal microscopy. Even when analyzed after 3 h, colocalization of TRAF2 and TRAF6 was not found reproducibly. Moreover, when colocalization was found, FRET was not routinely detected between TRAF2 and -6. Even by the more sensitive approach of flow cytometric FRET, physical interactions between TRAF2 and TRAF6 could not be reproducibly detected. The direct interaction between full-length TRAF2 and TRAF3 detected by confocal microscopy was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). TRAF2-TRAF3 Heterotypic Interactions Are Mediated by the TRAF-C Domain of TRAF3 and TRAF-N, ZnF4, and ZnF5 Regions of TRAF2—To identify the sequence elements that direct TRAF2 to interact with TRAF3, a series of deletion mutants of TRAF2 were fused to YFP and each was tested for an interaction with CFP-TRAF3. As noted previously, markedly positive FRET signals were detected between full-length CFP-TRAF3 and YFP-TRAF2 (Fig. 6). Of interest, the intensity of FRET for TRAF2-TRAF3 heterotypic interactions was not significantly different from FRET observed for either the TRAF2 or TRAF3 homotypic interactions. Removal of the TRAF-C of TRAF2 did not affect FRET, whereas further deletion of the TRAF-N domain and the ZnFs resulted in complete loss of FRET. Expression of either ZnF1 to ZnF5 or the TRAF domain alone of TRAF2 resulted in no FRET with CFP-TRAF3. However, ZnF1 to ZnF5 and TRAF-N of TRAF2 or the RING and ZnFs of TRAF2 were sufficient to interact with TRAF3, although these interactions were less efficient than with full-length TRAF2. Furthermore, removal of ZnF4 and ZnF5 from the RING and ZnF mutant of TRAF2 eliminated interaction with TRAF3. Taken together, the data indicate that the TRAF-N domain, ZnF4, and ZnF5 of TRAF2 are sufficient to interact with TRAF3. A series of plasmids expressing C-terminal deletion mutants of TRAF3 fused with CFP were used to examine the motifs of TRAF3 involved in heterotypic interaction with YFP-TRAF2 (Fig. 7). Deletion of TRAF-C of TRAF3 abolished the ability of TRAF3 to interact with TRAF2, although TRAF3 lacking its TRAF-C domain co-localized with TRAF2. In contrast, a mutant of TRAF3 lacking the entire TRAF domain (TRAF-C and TRAF-N) and consisting of only the RING and ZnFs did associate with TRAF2 (1.15 ± 0.10, n = 11), although to a lesser degree than the full-length TRAF3. Further deletion of ZnFs 2-5 abolished the interaction of this TRAF3 mutant with TRAF2. Moreover, a TRAF3 mutant of the ZnFs and TRAF-N in the presence or absence o"

The generation of proteomic variations by alternative splicing of the calcium channel Cav1.2 α1-subunit can potentially provide a flexible mechanism for muscle or neuronal cells to respond to various physiological signals or to diseases. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are multimeric complexes comprising a main pore-forming α1-subunit in association with 2–3 auxiliary subunits. They play an essential role in numerous physiological processes including muscle excitation-contraction coupling, neurotransmitter release, gene expression, and hormone secretion. Four of the 10 voltage-gated Ca2+ channel α1-subunits characterized constitute the family of L-type Ca2+ channels, namely Cav1.1, Cav1.2, Cav1.3, and Cav1.4.The Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels are distinguished by their high sensitivity to antagonists such as dihydropyridines (DHPs), 1The abbreviations used are: DHP, dihydropyridine; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: DHP, dihydropyridine; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase. phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines and their distinctive slow inactivating IBa currents (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). However, in response to a cytoplasmic rise in Ca2+ concentration, the Cav1.2 L-type channels exhibit two opposing channel properties. On the one hand, the L-type channels inactivate robustly with the rise in local [Ca2+]i, and on the other, the channels also facilitate to enhance Ca2+ entry. Both these Ca2+ regulatory processes are mediated by calmodulin that acts as the Ca2+ sensor (2Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These drugs bind with high affinity to the DHP binding site, which is composed of transmembrane segments, IS6, IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6 of the α11.2 subunit (5Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Striessnig J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 242-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The human α11.2 gene, CACNA1C, contains 55 exons, of which 19 exons are subjected to alternative splicing (7Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Tang Z.Z. Liang M.C. Lu S. Yu D. Yu C.Y. Yue D.T. Soong T.W. J. Biol.

The inclusion of 8 instead of 8a to form IS6 conferred a higher sensitivity to DHPs (5Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The exons encoding IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6 are, however, constitutive exons, not subjected to alternative splicing.Other investigators employed cDNA library screening and analyses of the α11.2 subunit and identified the “smooth muscle” and “cardiac muscle” α11.2 splice combinations as differing in four regions: (i) exon 1/1a; (ii) exon 8/8a; (iii) ±75 nucleotides in the I-II loop (termed exon 9* in this report); and (iv) exon 31/32. The cardiac muscle form was proposed to consist of splice combination 1a/8a/-9*/31, whereas the proposed smooth muscle splice combination was 1/8/+9*/32 (9Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R.

Whereas exon 8/8a determines DHP sensitivity, exon 1a containing Cav1.2 channels in cardiac muscle could be regulated indirectly by protein kinase C to relieve the inhibition of the channel by exon 1a (12Shistik E.

The “smooth muscle” form of Cav1.2 channels contains exon 8 and therefore exhibits larger inhibition by DHP (5Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the cellular localization and electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels are largely unknown. In a separate study, we did not detect any difference in the electrophysiological properties of Cav1.2 channels containing either exon 31 or 32 (8Tang Z.Z. Liang M.C. Lu S. Yu D. Yu C.Y. Yue D.T. Soong T.W. J. Biol.

Whole-cell electrophysiological characterization of the ±9*-containing Cav1.2 channels revealed altered electrophysiological properties, but the sensitivity to nifedipine blockade was similar. Such expression of an alternatively spliced exon in smooth muscle would contribute to the fine tuning of Cav1.2 channel function and influence smooth muscle contractility.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of α1C77-9* Expression Construct—We performed RT-PCR of human heart cDNA (Quickclone; catalog no. 7121-1; Clontech) to amplify the region spanning exons 6–11 of the α11.2 subunit. The PCR product with exon 9* was first cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis (GenBank™ accession number AY562395). The α1C77-9* construct was generated by exchanging a ClaI and SgrAI PCR fragment containing exon 9* into α1C77-WT (kindly provided by Dr. Roger Zuhlke) (14Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The inclusion of exon 9* in α1C77-9* is the only difference between this clone and α1C77-WT.Determination of Relative expression of ±9*-Cav1.2 Transcripts by RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from adult male (7–8 weeks) Wistar rat tissues or A7r5 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out with SUPERSCRIPT II (Invitrogen). Negative control (reactions without reverse transcriptase) was carried out in all RT-PCRs to exclude contamination. The primer pair used was as follows: (i) rat α11.2F (5′-GTCATCATCATCTATGCCATT-3′) and (ii) rat α11.2R (5′-GCGGCTGAACTTGGATT-3′). The PCR protocol includes a denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min.Generation of Polyclonal Antibody against Exon 9* Polypeptide— Human exon 9* of α11.2 subunit was cloned in frame into pGEX-4T-1, and this clone is designated α11.2-GST9*. Amino acid sequences from adjacent exon 9 or 10 were not included. GST-fused 9* protein was purified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Purified α11.2-GST9* protein was used to immunize female New Zealand White rabbit once a month. Complete Freund's adjuvant was first mixed with α11.2-GST9* for immunization, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used in subsequent injections once a month. Serum was preabsorbed with GST protein and polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified from immobilized α11.2-GST9* protein with an IgG elution buffer (Pierce). The antibody concentration is ∼1 μg/μl and is named pAb9*. Serum from rabbit before immunization was used as preimmune control. To determine nonspecific cross-reactivity with α11.3 exon 9* protein, a PCR fragment containing exons 9, 9*, 10, 12, 13, and 14 of α11.3 subunit isolated from a rat cochlea cDNA library was inserted into pET22b vector using the EcoRI and SalI restriction enzyme sites. The primers used were as follows: (i) Rat α11.3 F (5′-ATAGAATTCGGAAAGAGAGAAGGCTAAAGCACG-3′) and (ii) rat α11.3 R (5′-AAAGTCGACAAACGTGACAGACTTCACAGCTGC-3′). The fusion protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Amersham Biosciences).Determination of Tissue Specificity of pAb9* Antibody by Western Blot—Tissues from rat aorta, brain, and heart were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Due to the small quantity of rat aorta, six or seven aortas were pooled together for protein extraction. After centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 15 min, followed by 40,000 rpm for 1 h, membrane proteins were extracted from the pellet with lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Following centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h, 30 μg of proteins in the supernatant were separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein was then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a tank transfer system (Bio-Rad). After blocking the membrane with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), diluted primary pAb9* antibody (1:200) was added, and membrane was incubated for 2 h. A goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) was added, and the specific binding of the primary antibody was probed using the ECL system according to the company's protocol (catalog no. RPN2132; Amersham Biosciences).Immunohistochemical Localization of ±9*-containing Cav1.2 Channels—Tissues from adult male Wistar rats were cryosectioned at 8 μm in thickness. The sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7) for 20 min. After washing with 0.1% Triton/phosphate-buffered saline, 4% goat serum was used for blocking over 1 h. The samples were then incubated with primary antibodies (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used were either pAb9* or commercial antibodies such as (i) anti-α1C (Alomone Laboratories), recognizing the intracellular loop between domains II and III of Cav1.2 calcium channel, (ii) anti-α1D (Alomone Laboratories), and (iii) anti-α-smooth muscle actin (Chemicon). After washing with 0.1% Triton/phosphate-buffered saline, goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or goat antimouse Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody was added to the samples. The nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide, and the immunostainings were visualized using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview BX61; Olympus).To determine the specificity of staining of the pAb9* antibody to 9*-containing α11.2 channels, pAb9* was used either (i) after preabsorption with GST only or (ii) after preabsorption with GST followed by a second round of preabsorption with α11.2-GST9* (15Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahlijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar).Electrophysiological Recordings and Data Analysis—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with α1C77-WT or α1C77-9* (1.25 μg), β2a (1.25 μg), and α2δ (1.25 μg) using the standard calcium phosphate transfection method (8Tang Z.Z.

The β2a and α2δ clones were provided by Dr. Terry Snutch (University of British Columbia). IBa was recorded at room temperature using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, 48–72 h after transfection. The external solution contained 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm tetraethylammonium methanesulfonate, 5 mm BaCl2 (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH and osmolarity to 290–310 with glucose). The internal solution (pipette solution) contained 138 mm Cs-MeSO3, 5 mm CsCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml Mg-ATP, pH 7.3 (adjusted with CsOH). The osmolarities of solutions used were adjusted to between 290 and 300 mosm with glucose. The voltages are uncorrected for a -11-mV junction potential, and actual voltage can be obtained by subtracting 11 mV from the reported values. Whole-cell currents, obtained under voltage clamp with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), were filtered at 1–5 kHz and sampled at 5–50 kHz, and the series resistance was typically <5 megaohms after >70% compensation. The P/4 protocol was used to subtract online the leak and capacitive transients.To determine the whole-cell I-V relationships, currents were recorded by holding the cell at -90 mV before stepping to various potentials from -50 mV to 50 mV (ΔV = 10 mV) over 900 ms. In each cell, IBa at all voltages was normalized to the peak current. The steady-state inactivation curves were obtained from experiments by stepping from a holding potential of -90 mV to a family of 15-s-long prepulses, followed by a 104-ms test pulse to +10 mV. Each steady-state inactivation was normalized to the maximal current amplitude for comparison. G-V curves were obtained from a tail activation protocol. The cells were activated by a variable voltage family of 20-ms test pulses, and tail currents were measured after repolarization to -50 mV. Nifedipine (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to make a 10 mm stock solution. Nifedipine at various concentrations was applied to the HEK293 cells at a test pulse of 0 mV. Inhibition ratios were calculated by comparing the currents before and after drug treatment. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. GraphPad Prism software was used for data plotting and statistical analysis. Statistical significance of differences between means was calculated with Student's t test.RESULTSWe employed the transcript-scanning method (16Soong T.W. DeMaria C.D. Alvania R.S. Zweifel L.S.

Of the 19 splice exons reported by us, exon 9* has a low expression in human adult heart. However, there are reports that exon 9* belongs to the “smooth muscle” α1Cb isoform of Cav1.2 channels that also included alternatively spliced exons 1, 8, and 32 that are different from the “cardiac” α1Ca isoform (9Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Most of the reported data relied on the identification of exon 9* in a small number of isolated cDNA clones derived from tissues that presumably contained a heterogeneous mixture of cell types. As a result, exon 9* has been reported in rabbit lung, rabbit vascular and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, mouse brain, and A7r5 smooth muscle cell line (9Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Ma W.J. Holz R.W. Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

To resolve the notion that exon 9* may have selective expression on smooth muscle cells, we decided to first validate the molecular biological data by probing for exon 9* expression by RT-PCR in a cell line of smooth muscle origin and in fresh rat aorta and heart tissues. Next, we raised polyclonal antibody against exon 9* to determine the protein localization of 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels on smooth or cardiac muscles and on neurons.Selective Expression of Exon 9*-containing α11.2 Channel Transcript in Smooth Muscle—Fig. 1A showed two PCR products when RT-PCR experiments were performed on total RNA isolated from rat aorta cell line A7r5 and tissues from adult rat heart and aorta. The upper band is 755 bp, whereas the lower band is 680 bp in length. DNA sequencing and analyses of both PCR products revealed that the larger PCR product contained an additional 75-nucleotide sequence that encodes exon 9* (GenBank™ accession number AY323810). Delineation of the expression of exon 9* in the heart showed that all regions (left and right ventricles; left and right atriums) exhibited low levels of exon 9* with a similar expression pattern (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–5). The α11.2 subunit transcripts in aorta and A7r5 cell line, however, expressed high levels of exon 9* (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 6). These results provide strong evidence that the 9*-containing α11.2 transcript is expressed selectively at a high level in aortic smooth muscle but is expressed at a much lower level in cardiac muscle.Specificity of pAb9* Antibody—To further determine the cell-selective protein expression of exon 9*, we decided to raise a polyclonal antibody (pAb9*), against the 25-amino acid polypeptide encoded by exon 9*. We found a paralogous exon 9* reported in α11.3 in chick cochlea (21Kollmar R. Fak J. Montgomery L.G. Hudspeth A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14889-14893Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but did not find any other paralogous sequences in other calcium channels after a search in the public data base. From a rat cochlea cDNA library, we isolated a similar α11.3 subunit exon 9* flanked by exons 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of rat α11.2 exon 9* with the rat α11.3 exon 9* revealed a 36% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether the affinity-purified, GST-preabsorbed pAb9* may cross-react with α11.3 exon 9* polypeptide, we expressed exons 9–14 (including 9*) of α11.3 as His-tagged fusion protein. The immunoblot demonstrated clearly that only α11.2-GST9* was positively stained, whereas exon 9* of the α11.3 fusion protein was not stained (Fig. 2A). This result indicated that pAb9* did not cross-react with α11.3-exon 9* or with the adjacent amino acids within the I-II loop. To further demonstrate the specificity of pAb9*, Western blot analysis on rat aorta, heart, and brain protein lysates again displayed the highly selective expression of the ∼220-kDa 9*-containing Cav1.2 channel protein on aorta (Fig. 2B), which mirrored the transcript expression pattern (Fig. 1A). It is, however, possible that the 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels were expressed at such low levels in heart and brain and were undetectable, although equal amounts of proteins were used (Fig. 2B). Since total protein lysates contain both the ±9*-containing Cav1.2 channels, we decided to perform another test to determine pAb9* specificity on expressed ±9*-containing Cav1.2 cDNA clones in HEK293 cells. Confocal microscopy was employed to demonstrate that pAb9* specifically immunolabeled α1C77-9*-transfected but not α1C77-WT-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2C, left panel). When the Anti-α1C antibody was used, strong staining of both the α1C77-WT- and α1C77-9*-transfected HEK293 cells was indicative of their expression on the cell membrane (Fig. 2C, right panel).Fig. 2Specificity of pAb9* antibody determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.A, Western blot of α11.2 GST9* (lane 1) and α11.3 His-exons 9–14, including exon 9* (lane 2), using pAb9* demonstrated specific staining of α11.2 GST9*. Coomassie Blue staining showed a huge amount of expressed α11.2 GST9* (lane 3) and α11.3 His-exons 9–14 (lane 4) fusion proteins. B, immunoblot of protein lysates from rat aorta (lane 1), heart (lane 2), and brain (lane 3) displayed strong staining by pAb9* of aorta lysate to reveal 9*-containing Cav1.2 channel proteins (∼220 kDa) in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Similar amounts of protein (30 μg) were loaded and stained by Coomassie Blue (lane 4, aorta; lane 5, brain; lane 6, heart). C, immunofluorescent staining of α1C77-9*- or α1C77-WT-transfected HEK293 cells with pAb9* and anti-α1C antibodies showed membrane localization of the Cav1.2 channels. Inset images displayed staining of single HEK293 cells by either pAb9* or anti-α1C antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Selective Localization of 9*-containing Cav1.2 Channels on Arterial Smooth Muscles—Strong immunohistochemical stainings by the GST-preabsorbed pAb9* revealed the cellular localization of 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels on the walls of isolated arteries from the brain (Fig. 3, A and B). The co-localization of the pAb9* and α-smooth muscle actin signals provided convincing evidence that the 9*-α11.2 channels were expressed on the smooth muscles of the arterial wall (Fig. 3A). To further characterize the expression of 9*-α11.2 subunit on the arterial smooth muscle, serial sections of an artery on the surface of brain were used for the following experiments (Fig. 3B, a–f). The pAb9* stained strongly to detect α11.2 subunit protein expression on the arterial smooth muscles (Fig. 3B, a), whereas the pan-α1C antibody, anti-α1C, also produced similar patterns on smooth muscles for the Cav1.2 channels (Fig. 3B, b). The lack of co-localization of the propidium iodide signal that stained the nuclei (PI; red) with pAb9* or Anti-α1C staining (fluorescein isothiocyanate; green) would agree with the known transmembrane expression of Cav1.2 calcium channels on the plasma membrane. The pan-α1D antibody, anti-α1D, did not stain the smooth muscle, which, together with our data presented earlier, clearly argues against the possibility of cross-reactivity to the α11.3 subunit in the immunohistochemical experiments (Fig. 3B, c). Nonetheless, anti-α1D was able to stain HEK293 cells transfected with a rat α1D clone (data not shown). The specificity of pAb9* labeling of 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels on smooth muscle was again validated, since there was no staining with preimmune serum or with pAb9* that has been preabsorbed with α11.2-GST9* polypeptide (Fig. 3B, d and e). It should be noted that the internal elastic lamina could either be stained nonspecifically, or the signal was due to autofluorescence. Taken together, we conclude that the pAb9* antibody that we raised stained exon 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels specifically.Fig. 3Localization of 9*-containing Cav1.2 calcium channels on arteries.A, an artery isolated from brain was co-labeled with pAb9* (green) and anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SM Actin; red). Colocalization of the 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels and smooth muscle α-actin was demonstrated in the merged image (orange). Bars, 20 μm. B, serial sections of an artery on the surface of rat brain were immunostained with one of the following antibodies: pAb9* (a), anti-α1C antibody (b), anti-α1D antibody (c), preimmune serum (d), and pAb9* preabsorbed with α11.2 GST9* polypeptide (e). A phase-contrast image was shown in f. Autofluorescence of the arterial wall (green) clearly defines the internal elastic lamina. Nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide (red).

On the other hand, pAb9* produced a restricted and robust expression of 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels on the smooth muscle wall of the blood vessels, but in contrast, the cardiac muscle cells showed light staining (Supplementary Fig. S1A, upper panel). This finding confirmed the low level of exon 9* transcripts in heart that was revealed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A), since the isolated heart total RNA would contain a mixture of mRNAs from cardiac and smooth muscle cells. This contamination by smooth muscle 9*-containing Cav1.2 transcripts would misrepresent the actual exon 9* transcript expression level in cardiac muscle.Catterall et al. (15Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E.

In the cerebellum, Cav1.2 mRNA was reported to be expressed in the granular layer but not in Purkinje cells or the molecular layer (22Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J.

The data agree with our observation that the anti-α1C antibody stained the neurons in the granule layer of the cerebellum (Supplementary Fig. S1B, lower panel), but there was a lack of staining on the Purkinje cells and the molecular layer. The overall expression pattern of Cav1.2 channels on the granule layer is therefore consistent with published results (22Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tanaka O. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although anti-α1C stained the granular layer, the pAb9* antibody did not detect any expression of 9*-containing Cav1.2 channels on the neurons of the granular layer (Supplementary Fig. S1B, upper panel). This suggests the absence of exon 9* in α11.2 proteins expressed on cerebellar neurons. As such, the isolation of brain α11.2 cDNAs containing exon 9* reported by Ma et al. (19Ma W.J. Holz R.W. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22728-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would probably be due to the presence of 9*-c"

Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) plays an essential role in regulation of vascular function and structure by blood flow. Although cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitory ligand of cyclophilin A, is a widely used immunosuppressive drug, it causes arterial hypertension in part by impairing eNOS-dependent vasodilation. Here we show that CsA inhibits fluid shear stress-mediated eNOS activation in endothelial cells via decreasing cholesterol content in caveolae. Exposure of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells to 1 μm CsA for 1 h significantly inhibited NO production and eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 induced by flow (shear stress = 12 dynes/cm2). The effect of CsA was not related to inhibition of two known eNOS kinases, protein kinase B (Akt) and protein kinase A, because CsA did not affect Akt or protein kinase A activation. In rabbit aorta perfused ex vivo, CsA also significantly inhibited flow-induced eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 but had no effect on Akt measured by phosphorylation at Ser-473. However, CsA treatment decreased cholesterol content in caveolae and displaced eNOS from caveolae, which may be caused by CsA disrupting the association of caveolin-1 and cyclophilin A. The magnitude of the cholesterol depleting effect was similar to that of β-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-binding molecule, and β-cyclodextrin had a similar inhibitory effect on flow-mediated eNOS activation. Treating bovine aortic endothelial cells for 24 h with 30 μg/ml cholesterol blocked the CsA effect and restored eNOS phosphorylation in response to flow. These data suggest that decreasing cholesterol content in caveolae by CsA is a potentially important pathogenic mechanism for CsA-induced endothelial dysfunction and hypertension.

Phosphorylation and activation of eNOS is not only dependent on upstream kinases but is also determined by its specific subcellular location (13Shaul P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 749-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In particular, the localization of eNOS in caveolae affects the function of the enzyme, including the interaction of eNOS with proteins such as caveolin-1 and heat shock protein 90 (6Fleming I.

Whereas eNOS bound with caveolin-1 is inactive in caveolae, localization of eNOS to caveolae is required for its activation by stimuli because conditions that inhibit the localization of eNOS in caveolae (e.g. inhibition of eNOS myristoylation and cholesterol depletion) markedly decrease eNOS activity (14Hirata K.

Physiol. 2001; 280: F193-F206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol is one of the main constituents of caveolae and is essential for normal caveolae function (13Shaul P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 749-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Incubating endothelial cells with agents that lower the cholesterol content of caveolae such as oxidized low density lipoprotein and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) cause eNOS to translocate from the caveolae and inhibit eNOS activation (16Blair A.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive drug that acts by binding cyclophilin A (CyPA), thereby inhibiting the activity of calcineurin, which regulates responses necessary for T cell activation (18Swanson S.K.

Since its introduction in clinical practice, CsA has been linked to a major side effect, arterial hypertension (19Nichelle L. Canet S. Garrigue V. Chong G. Mourad G. Transplant.

Rep. 2002; 4: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), much evidence points to endothelial dysfunction as an essential factor in the pathogenesis of CsA-induced hypertension. Roullet et al. (22Roullet J.B. Xue H. McCarron D.A. Holcomb S. Bennett W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2244-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) found that CsA-induced hypertension was the consequence of a primary effect on resistance vessel relaxation, not increased vasoconstriction. On one hand, CsA is known to increase superoxide production (23Diederich D. Skopec J. Diederich A. Dai F.X. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that should decrease NO bioavailability caused by peroxynitrite formation. On the other hand, CsA has been suggested to decrease NO production by eNOS (24Oriji G.K. Keiser H.R. Am. J. Hypertens. 1999; 12: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Oriji G.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29669-29673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed that CsA inhibited VEGF-induced eNOS activation by blocking calcineurin-mediated eNOS dephosphorylation at serine 116 but not its phosphorylation at serine 1179. However, the mechanisms by which CsA inhibits flow-mediated eNOS activation remain unknown. Here we show that CsA treatment inhibits flow-mediated eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. We provide evidence that this inhibitory effect of CsA is caused by a decrease of caveolae cholesterol content resulting in the displacement of eNOS from caveolae without inhibition of kinases known to phosphorylate eNOS. Reagents—Antibodies to phospho-eNOS (Ser-1179 in bovine eNOS), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), eNOS, and Akt were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Caveolin-1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The antibody to PKA (rabbit polyclonal) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). CyPA antibody was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). VASP antibody was from Alexis. Cell Culture—BAEC purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Walkers-ville, Inc. (formerly Clonetics), were grown on gelatin-coated 60-mm tissue culture dishes in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). After confluence the cells were growth-arrested overnight using media with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for the flow experiments. Flow Experiments for Cultured Cells—Before the experiment BAEC in culture dishes were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced saline solution (130 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 1.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.0 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4) with l g/liter glucose and 140 mg/liter CaCl2 at 37 °C. The cells were then subjected to either steady laminar flow in a cone and plate viscometer or static conditions for the same amount of time at 37 °C (27Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For harvest, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—BAEC were lysed in Triton/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μl/ml protease inhibitor (Sigma), scraped off the dish, sonicated (4 × 10 s bursts, Ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710 Series, Cole-Palmer Instrument Co., Chicago IL), and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was analyzed for protein concentration using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein (30 μg/sample) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™ ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and was visualized with the ECL system. For immunoprecipitation, lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were precleaned by incubating with protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h and then incubated with anti-CyPA antibody and rocked overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h, precipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After denaturation the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Detergent-free Purification of Caveolae-enriched Membrane Fractions—Caveolae-enriched membrane fractions were prepared following a protocol reported (28Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were grown in gelatin-coated 150-mm tissue culture dishes. Upon confluence they were growth-arrested overnight. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer 1 (500 mm Na2CO3 pH 11, 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture solution), homogenized (30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer), and sonicated (3 × 10-s bursts, Ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710 Series, Cole-Palmer Instrument Co., Chicago IL). The homogenate was placed in a 17-ml ultracentrifuge tube and was adjusted to 45% sucrose by adding 2 ml of buffer 2 (90% sucrose, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture solution). 4 ml of each buffer 3 (35% sucrose, 250 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture solution) and buffer 4 (5% sucrose, 250 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture solution) were layered on top of it, and the samples were centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 20 h in a SORVALL Discovery™ 100S Ultracentrifuge equipped with Sure-spin™ 630 (17 ml) rotor (Kendro Laboratory Products, Newton, CT). 12 × 1-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of each tube. An equal volume of each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis and probed for eNOS, caveolin-1, and CyPA with corresponding antibodies. NO Measurements—The media were collected after the flow experiments, and the NO content was quantified with a Sievers NOA280 nitric oxide analyzer (27Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). PKA Activity Assay—PKA activity in caveolae-enriched membrane fractions was measured using a PKA activity assay kit from Stressgen Bioreagents (British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cholesterol Measurements—Caveolae (represented by fractions 4, 5, and 6 from sucrose gradient separation) were pooled, and lipids were pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was lipid-extracted (0.6 ml of chloroform, 0.3 ml of methanol and 150 μl of saline). After mixing, the bottom layer containing chloroform with the lipids was left to evaporate under a hood. A Triton-chloroform extraction was then performed following a protocol described by De Hoff et al. (29De Hoff J.L. Davidson L.M. Kritchevsky D. Clin. Chem. 1978; 24: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The amount of cholesterol was measured using a Cholesterol CII kit (Wako) and normalized to the total protein concentration. Adenovirus Infection—For the infection of BAEC with recombinant adenovirus, BAEC were seeded on gelatin-coated dishes the day before infection. Cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus at 100 multiplicity of infection in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h, incubated for 24 h in a growth medium, and then growth-arrested overnight before the treatment. Construction of adenovirus-expressing PKA inhibitor (PKI) has been described previously (30Aizawa T. Wei H. Miano J.M. Abe J. Berk B.C. Yan C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) was used as a control. Ex vivo Flow Experiments—Using isolated rabbit aortic segments, flow experiments were performed exactly as described previously (31Yamawaki H. Lehoux S. Berk B.C. Circulation. 2003; : 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All results are reported as mean ± S.E. Western blots were quantified using the NIH Image 1.6 software to yield arbitrary densitometry units. The significance of the results was assessed by a paired Student's t test or by analysis of variance where appropriate. CsA Inhibits Flow-induced NO Production and eNOS Phosphorylation in BAEC—In endothelial cells, flow increases NO production proportional to the level of fluid shear stress applied (7Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of CsA on NO production, we treated growth arrested BAEC with 1 μm CsA or vehicle for 1 h and then exposed cells to either flow (an arterial level of laminar shear stress = 12 dynes/cm2) or static culture for 30 min. In response to flow for 30 min, NO released by BAEC increased by 2.2- ± 0.5-fold relative to control cells maintained in static culture (Fig. 1, p = 0.02). In cells pretreated for 1 h with CsA, NO production stimulated by flow (1.2- ± 0.2-fold) was significantly inhibited by 83% compared with control conditions (Fig. 1). CsA treatment had no significant effect on basal NO production (Fig. 1). An increase in pS1179-eNOS by flow has been shown to correlate with increased NO production (9Gallis B. Corthals G.L. Goodlett D.R. Ueba H. Kim F. Presnell S.R. Figeys D. Harrison D.G. Berk B.C. Aebersold R. Corson M.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A (upper panel), flow rapidly increased pS1179-eNOS that was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with CsA. There was no change in eNOS expression during the time course of the experiment (Fig. 2A, lower panel). In our system, flow increased pS1179-eNOS by 5.5- ± 0.6-fold at 5 min and maximally by 8.5- ± 1.0-fold at 30 min (Fig. 2B, n = 5). CsA inhibited eNOS phosphorylation by 17% (p = 0.37), 58% (p = 0.02), and 73% (p = 0.04) at 5, 10, and 30 min, respectively (Fig. 2B). CsA Does Not Inhibit Flow-stimulated Akt Activation—Akt has been shown to phosphorylate pS1179-eNOS in response to flow (9Gallis B. Corthals G.L. Goodlett D.R. Ueba H. Kim F. Presnell S.R. Figeys D. Harrison D.G. Berk B.C. Aebersold R. Corson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30101-30108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B.

Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). To measure Akt activation we used a phospho-specific antibody for Akt serine 473 (pS473-Akt) that correlates with Akt kinase activity (32Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). In response to flow, pS473-Akt increased with a time course very similar to pS1179-eNOS (Fig. 3A). There was, however, no inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by CsA pretreatment in contrast to the dramatic inhibition of pSer1179-eNOS (compare Figs. 2 and 3). Quantitation of the results showed that flow increased pS473-Akt maximally by 4.5- ± 1.1-fold compared with static conditions (p = 0.03, n = 4). In cells pretreated with 1 μm CsA, flow increased pS473-Akt maximally by 4.0- ± 0.6-fold compared with static conditions (p = 0.02, n = 4). There were no significant differences between control and CsA-treated cells at any time point. CsA Does Not Inhibit PKA-mediated eNOS Phosphorylation at Serine 1179—In addition to Akt, PKA has been shown to mediate pS1179-eNOS in vitro and in vivo (33Michell B.J. Chen Z.-p. Tiganis T.

To evaluate the role of PKA in our system, we first characterized the inhibitory effect of PKI on forskolin-induced PKA activation and eNOS phosphorylation. PKA activation in cells was evaluated by phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), an established substrate for both PKA and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. VASP is a 46-kDa protein that is phosphorylated preferentially at Ser-239 by cGMP-dependent protein kinase and at Ser-157 by PKA. Phosphorylation of Ser-157 leads to a shift in the apparent molecular weight from 46–50 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which is detectable by Western blot analysis using anti-VASP antibody (30Aizawa T. Wei H. Miano J.M. Abe J. Berk B.C. Yan C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Harbeck B. Huttelmaier S. Schluter K. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30817-30825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In BAEC infected with a control viral vector (adenovirus-expressing LacZ), forskolin induced VASP phosphorylation and associated mobility shift (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Infection with adenovirus-expressing PKI (100 multiplicity of infection) inhibited PKA as shown by the failure of forskolin to increase VASP phosphorylation and mobility shift (Fig. 4A, upper panel). PKI also inhibited pS1179-eNOS stimulated by forskolin (Fig. 4A, lower panel). These data confirm that forskolin-induced VASP phosphorylation and pSer1179-eNOS are PKA-dependent. Next, we studied the effect of CsA on forskolin-induced PKA activation and pS1179-eNOS. Pretreatment with 1 μm CsA did not inhibit forskolin-induced VASP phosphorylation and pS1179-eNOS (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that CsA does not inhibit PKA-mediated pS1179-eNOS. Finally, we studied the effect of PKI on flow-mediated pS1179-eNOS. Infection with adenovirus-expressing PKI significantly inhibited (65%, n = 3) flow-mediated pS1179-eNOS compared with infection with LacZ adenovirus (Fig. 4C, upper panel). These results indicate a significant role for PKA in flow-induced pS1179-eNOS. There was no significant effect of PKI on pS473-Akt (Fig. 4C, lower panel). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of CsA on flow-mediated pS1179-eNOS was caused by inhibition of PKA activation, we studied the effects of CsA on flow-mediated PKA activation. However, we did not observe any significant VASP phosphorylation in response to flow either in the absence or presence of CsA. This finding is consistent with previous reports documenting no change in cAMP level with flow measured in whole cells (36Malek A.M. Greene A.L. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5999-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because both PKA and eNOS have been shown to be compartmentalized and regulated by an interaction with caveolin in caveolae, we further examined the effect of CsA on PKA localization and activation in caveolae. To analyze PKA localization in BAEC, we used a sucrose density gradient method to separate cellular fractions and isolate caveolae (28Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, 12 fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis and probed for PKA and caveolin-1 with corresponding antibodies. In control conditions without CsA treatment, caveolin-1 was found mainly in fractions 4, 5, and 6 that represent the caveolae fractions (28Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D, first panel). Although PKA mainly was detected in heavier fractions (Fig. 4D, second panel, fractions 7–11), a small amount of PKA was found in caveolae as well. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that PKA is localized in caveolae of endothelial cells. However, exposure to 1 μm CsA for 1 h did not induce any significant change in PKA distribution in caveolae (Fig. 4D, second panel versus fourth panel). Furthermore, flow did not change the localization of PKA in caveolae (Fig. 4E), and CsA had no effect on PKA distribution in the presence of flow (Fig. 4E). Finally, neither CsA treatment nor flow changed PKA kinase activity in caveolae (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that CsA does not change PKA localization and activation in caveolae. CsA Displaces eNOS from Caveolae in Endothelial Cells— The localization of eNOS in caveolae is important for its activation by physiologic stimuli (6Fleming I. Busse R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R1-R12PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shaul P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 749-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 17Govers R. Rabelink T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F193-F206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation for CsA mediated inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation by flow is translocation of eNOS to a cellular site where it is no longer accessible for activation. As Exposure to 1 μm CsA for 1 h induced a small redistribution of caveolin-1 from caveolae to heavier fractions (Fig. 5A, second panel, fractions 7–11), suggesting that CsA may slightly disrupts caveolae integrity. In contrast, although eNOS was concentrated in caveolae in control conditions (Fig. 5A, third"
https://openalex.org/W2064703015,"The addition of telomeric repeats to chromosome ends by the enzyme telomerase is a highly orchestrated process. Although much is known regarding telomerase catalytic activity <i>in vitro</i>, less is known about how this activity is regulated <i>in vivo</i> to ensure proper telomere elongation. One protein that appears to be involved in negatively regulating telomerase function <i>in vivo</i> is PinX1 because overexpression of PinX1 inhibits telomerase activity and causes telomere shortening. To understand the nature of this repression, we characterized the interactions among PinX1 and the core components of telomerase, the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and associated human telomerase RNA (hTR). We now show that <i>in vitro</i> PinX1 binds directly to the hTERT protein subunit, primarily to the hTR-binding domain, as well as to the hTR subunit. However, in a cellular context, the association of PinX1 with hTR is dependent on the presence of hTERT. Taken together, we suggest that PinX1 represses telomerase activity <i>in vivo</i> by binding to the assembled hTERT·hTR complex."
https://openalex.org/W2139743386,"Signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) plays a central role in early embryonic patterning, organogenesis, and homeostasis in a broad range of species. Chordin, an extracellular antagonist of BMP signaling, is thought to readily diffuse in tissues, thus forming gradients of BMP inhibition that result in reciprocal gradients of BMP signaling. The latter determine cell fates along the embryonic dorsoventral axis. The secreted protein Twisted Gastrulation (TSG) is thought to help shape BMP signaling gradients by acting as a cofactor that enhances Chordin inhibition of BMP signaling. Here, we demonstrate that mammalian Chordin binds heparin with an affinity similar to that of factors known to functionally interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in tissues. We further demonstrate that Chordin binding in mouse embryonic tissues was dependent upon its interaction with cell-surface HSPGs and that Chordin bound to cell-surface HSPGs (e.g. syndecans), but not to basement membranes containing the HSPG perlecan. Surprisingly, mammalian TSG did not bind heparin unless prebound to Chordin and/or BMP-4, although Drosophila TSG has been reported to bind heparin on its own. Results are also presented that indicate that Chordin-HSPG interactions strongly potentiate the antagonism of BMP signaling by Chordin and are necessary for the retention and uptake of Chordin by cells. These data and others regarding Chordin diffusion have implications for the paradigm of how Chordin is thought to regulate BMP signaling in the extracellular space and how gradients of BMP signaling are formed."
https://openalex.org/W2010368333,"Altered expression of receptor tyrosine kinases contributes to tumorigenic behaviors of epithelial cancers. In this study, the pathogenic roles of receptor tyrosine kinase RON (recepteur d'origine nantais) in regulating oncogenic phenotypes in colorectal epithelial cells were studied. Increased expression of RON and its variants resulted in colony formation and motile activities of colonic epithelial AA/C1 cells as evident in soft-agar and migration assays, respectively. These results suggest that overexpression of wild-type RON mediates the transformed phenotypes in immortalized colon epithelial cells. In colorectal cancer cells (HT-29, HCT116, and SW620) that naturally express RON, the RON gene expression was silenced by RNA interference. The introduction of RON-specific small interfering (si) RNA significantly affected cancer cell proliferation, motility, and led to increased apoptotic cell death. Focus-forming activities and anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells were also dramatically reduced. Moreover, it was demonstrated in tumor growth assays that silencing RON gene expression significantly reduces tumorigenic activities of SW620 cells in vivo. By analysing signaling proteins involved in colon carcinogenesis, we found that the effect of RON-specific siRNA is associated with diminished expression of beta-catenin, a critical component in the Wnt signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate that altered expression of RON in colon cancer cells is required to maintain tumorigenic phenotypes. Thus, silencing RON gene expression could have potential to reverse malignant activities of colon tumors in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2095377294,"Similar to its human homologues TRF1 and TRF2, fission yeast Taz1 protein is a component of telomeric chromatin regulating proper telomere maintenance. As mammalian TRF1 and TRF2 proteins have been shown to directly bind telomeric DNA to form protein arrays and looped structures, termed t-loops, the ability of Taz1p to act on fission yeast telomeric DNA in similar ways was examined using purified protein and model DNA templates. When incubated with Taz1p, model telomeres containing 3′ single-stranded telomeric overhangs formed t-loops at a frequency approaching 13%. Termini with blunt ends and non-telomeric overhangs were deficient in t-loop formation. In addition, we observed arrays of multiple Taz1p molecules bound to the telomeric regions, resembling the pattern of TRF1 binding. The presence of t-loops larger than the telomeric tract, a high frequency of end-bound DNAs and a donut shape of the Taz1p complex suggest that Taz1p binds the 3′ overhang then extrudes a loop that grows in size as the donut slides along the duplex DNA.

Based on these in vitro results we discuss possible general implications for fission yeast telomere dynamics. Telomeres, the DNA-protein complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes, stabilize the termini and protect them from end-to-end fusion. With a few exceptions, telomeres of most eukaryotic cells consist of an array of short repeats rich in guanines on the strand running 5′ to 3′ toward the chromosome end. Another general feature of nuclear telomeres is the presence of a 3′ overhang of the G-rich strand at the termini (reviewed in Ref. 1McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 255: 331-358Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that telomeres exist in at least two different states (2Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), they “open” to allow telomerase to access the end of the telomeric DNA and then “close” to protect chromosome ends from unwanted recombination and mask them from the double strand break repair systems. Changes from open to closed states would be mediated by specific protein components of the telomeric chromatin (3Rhodes D. Fairall L. Simonsson T. Court R. Chapman L.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Although TRF1 and TRF2 exhibit a high degree of homology, their role in telomere dynamics seems to be different, probably because of the differences at their N termini (22Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In contrast to TRF2, TRF1 is unable to promote t-loop formation in vitro. Whereas TRF1 forms filamentous structures on telomeric repeat arrays and promotes parallel pairing of telomeric tracts in vitro (23Griffith J. Bianchi A. de Lange T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), TRF2 induces t-loop formation and binds preferentially to the ss/ds junction at the 3′ telomeric overhang (24Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). A 5′-TTAGGG-3′ overhang of at least six nucleotides is required for loop formation. Termini with 5′ overhangs or blunt-ended ends are deficient in loop formation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae with its powerful genetic and molecular biologic tools would seem to offer a valuable system for the detailed analysis of t-loop formation. Indirect genetic evidence suggests that telomeres in S. cerevisiae appear to form fold-back structures thus emphasizing telomere looping as a common theme in telomere architecture (25Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Pryde F.E. Louis E.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2538-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 27de Bruin D.

Nature. 2001; 409: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that the budding yeast telomeres form “true” t-loops. First, telomeric sequences in S. cerevisiae are very heterogeneous (C2–3ACA1–6/T1–6GTG2–3) (29Shampay J. Szostak J.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1984; 310: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 30Wang S.S. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4415-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which would decrease the probability that the 3′ telomeric overhang could invade into the double-stranded telomeric region based on base complementarity. In addition, the budding yeast genome does not contain a gene encoding a TRF-like telomeric protein. Rap1 protein contains its own Myb domain and seems to fulfill functions divided between TRF proteins and hRap1p in mammalian cells (which lacks a Myb domain) (31Marcand S. Gilson E. Shore D. Science. 1997; 275: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 32McEachern M.J. Iyer S. Fulton T.B. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11409-11414Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to S. cerevisiae, telomeric repeats of Schizosaccharomyces pombe are more regular with a consensus sequence 5′-GGTTACA-3′ (33Hiraoka Y. Henderson E. Blackburn E.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The length of the telomere, excluding the telomere associated sequences (TAS1, TAS2) is on average 300 bp. In addition, the fission yeast contains a TRF homologue (Taz1p) and similar to mammalian cells, spRap1 binds to the telomeres indirectly via Taz1p. In addition, the role of spRap1p seems to be restricted to telomeres and thus is distinct from that of scRap1p, which is involved in silencing at both the telomere and mating type locus (34Park M.J. Jang Y.K. Choi E.S. Kim H.S. Park S.D. Mol. Cells. 2002; 13: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, fission yeast may provide a more relevant model for the study of TRF-mediated telomere transactions and the evolution of mammalian-like telosome. Taz1p (telomere-associated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) was originally found in a one-hybrid screen using telomeric DNA as a target (35Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It shares homology to the Myb proto-oncogene DNA-binding domains present in both TRF1 and TRF2. In addition, similar to TRF1 and TRF2, it contains a centrally located sequence motif of about 200 amino acids, referred to as the TRF homology domain that is unique to this gene family and overlaps with a dimerization domain mediating strong homotypic interactions (14Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 36Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The possibility that Taz1p functions in fission yeast may encompass those of both hTRF1 and hTRF2 is consistent with the observation that the Myb domain and TRF homology domain of Taz1p are more homologous to hTRF1, whereas other regions of Taz1p show higher levels of homology with hTRF2 (37Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Disruption of the taz1+ gene in S. pombe is not lethal and taz1– haploids grow vegetatively at the same rate as wild-type cells. Deletion of taz1+ causes a roughly 10-fold increase in telomere length (35Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, despite the changes in telomere length, taz1– cells did not exhibit a decrease in viability after extensive subculturing (35Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In contrast to vegetative growth, sexual reproduction of taz1– cells is aberrant because of defective meiosis (35Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the role of Taz1p in meiotic division revealed that it is necessary for telomere aggregation adjacent to the spindle pole body during meiotic prophase. In the absence of Taz1p, telomere clustering at the spindle pole bodies is disrupted, meiotic recombination is reduced (3–10-fold), and both spore viability and the ability of zygotes to re-enter mitosis is impaired (38Chikashige Y. Ding D.Q. Imai Y. Yamamoto M. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39Cooper J.P. Watanabe Y. Nurse P. Nature. 1998; 392: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 40Nimmo E.R. Pidoux A.L. Perry P.E. Allshire R.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in meiosis, Taz1p is required for the repression of telomere-adjacent gene expression, most likely by establishing or maintaining a telosome structure (35Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that mating of taz1+ and taz1– cells results in diploids, in which the telomeres remain longer than normal for many generations, although the telomere position effect is quickly restored. Importantly, Taz1p remains associated with subtelomeres even in the absence of telomeric repeats thus emphasizing its role in inheritance of telomeric chromatin (41Sadaie M. Naito T. Ishikawa F. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2271-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the mitotic growth of taz1– cells is similar to wild-type under stress-free conditions, taz1– cells exhibit lethal telomere fusions when subjected to nitrogen starvation inducing an uncommitted G1 state (42Ferreira M.G. Cooper J.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The fusions are mediated by the Ku-dependent nonhomologous end joining pathway and are not dependent on homologous recombination (42Ferreira M.G. Cooper J.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taz1p is also essential for cell cycle progression at 20 °C, a temperature at which Δtaz1 mutants exhibit a G2/M checkpoint delay, chromosome missegregation, and double-strand DNA breaks (43Miller K.M. Cooper J.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, analogous to mammalian TRF2 protein, Taz1p helps provide a telomeric cap that prevents Ku from recognizing telomeres as double-strand breaks. Similar to the taz1– mutant, the rap1– mutant of S. pombe is nonessential for mitotic growth, but leads to elongation of telomeres and defective meiosis. Cells disrupted for both taz1+ and rap1+ genes exhibit the same phenotype as single disruptants suggesting that they function in the same pathway(s) (44Chikashige Y. Hiraoka Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1618-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus Rap1p of fission yeast binds to the telomere through interaction with Taz1p, paralleling that found in human cells (18Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Whereas the list of the fission yeast telomeric proteins has grown rapidly, their precise roles in establishing telomere architecture are still unknown. Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we have begun to reconstitute the fission yeast telosome. We have generated a model telomere DNA containing a double-stranded array of consensus telomeric repeats (5′-GGTTACA-3′) and in which the ss overhang can be altered in sequence and length. Using this artificial telomere, we examined the ability of recombinant Taz1p to bind to this telomeric DNA in vitro and to organize the model telomeres into different structures. Both arrays of Taz1 bound along the telomere and t-loop forms were observed, pointing to the similarities between Taz1p and TRF1 and TRF2, and shedding more light on TRFmediated telomere remodeling in all eukaryotic systems. Enzymes and Oligonucleotides—Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, calf intestinal phosphatase, and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech Inc. (Greensboro, NC) or Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and either contained a 5′ phosphate, or were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Construction of S. pombe Model Telomere DNA—A plasmid containing a block of fission yeast consensus telomere repeats 5′-GGTTACA-3′ flanked by asymmetric restriction sites for BbsI and BsmBI was constructed using the approach of Stansel et al. (24Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Several cycles of telomeric track expansion resulted in a plasmid (pLT500) containing 74 telomeric repeats (518 bp). All plasmid constructs were propagated in Escherichia coli Sure2 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ligation of Oligonucleotide Tails to pLT500—The plasmid pLT500 was digested with BsmBI and BamHI and dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase. Ligation reaction mixtures contained 3 μg of the linearized plasmid, a 5-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide, and 400 units of T4 DNA ligase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and T4 DNA ligase (400 units). The free oligonucleotides were removed using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purification of Recombinant Taz1p-His (Further Taz1p)—The bacterial strain overproducing Taz1 with an N-terminal His tag (pQE30 vector, Qiagen) and protocol for its purification on Ni-NTA Superflow agarose were provided by Dr. Julia P. Cooper (Cancer Research Institute, London, United Kingdom). For some preparations, Talon™ Metal affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was employed instead of Ni-NTA. Typically, a protein extract from a 1-liter culture was loaded on 1 ml of the beads and the bound proteins were eluted stepwise with increasing concentrations (50–250 mm) of imidazole. The Taz1p containing fractions were dialyzed using a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce) against 1 liter of 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and stored at –20 °C. The fractions eluted from the nickel column contained two major bands migrating at apparent sizes of 90 and 70 kDa based on SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The two forms of Taz1p were separated by reloading the sample on the Ni-NTA column followed by elution with a gradient (50–250 mm) imidazole. Mass Spectrometry—The precise molecular weights of Taz1p and a C-terminal truncated form were determined by Dr. Christoph Borcher in the University of North Carolina Michael Hooker Proteomics Core Facility using an Electrospray Ionization Quadrapole Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometer following in-gel tryptic digestion of the proteins (46Borchers C. Peter J.F. Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Tomer K.B. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol for 60 min at 250 mA. Probing with the anti-penta(His) antibodies (Qiagen) and subsequent chemiluminescent assay using the BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting Kit (Roche Diagnostics) were performed according to the corresponding manufacturer's instructions. Determination of Molecular Mass of Native Taz1p—The apparent molecular mass of native Taz1p was determined using gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with apoferritin (440 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To obtain a dsDNA probe the pLT126 plasmid carrying 18 telomeric repeats was digested with BsmBI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs), followed by heat inactivation of the enzyme at 80 °C for 20 min. The resulting 4-nucleotide 5′ overhang was filled in by using Klenow exo– polymerase (New England Biolabs) and 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP under standard reaction conditions for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passing the DNA through a Sephadex G-50 column. The resulting DNA was incubated with increasing amounts of Taz1pΔC or Taz1p, respectively, for 20 min at 37 °C, and the resulting complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) buffer, and visualized by autoradiography. Taz1p-DNA Incubations and Electron Microscopy—Model telomere DNAs (50–200 ng) containing different overhangs were incubated with 100 ng of Taz1p (see figure legends for details) for 2 to 20 min at room temperature in a final volume of 25 μl of buffer B (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). To directly examine the complexes by EM, the samples were fixed by adding an equal volume of 1.2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. To remove excess protein and fixatives the samples were passed over 2-ml columns of Bio-Gel A50m equilibrated with TE. Aliquots of the fractions containing the complexes were mixed with a buffer containing spermidine for 35 s and adsorbed onto copper grids coated with thin carbon film, glow charged shortly before sample application. Following adsorption of the samples to the EM support for 2–3 min, the grids were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and rotary shadowcast at 10–7 torr with tungsten (47Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To stain single-stranded tails on the model telomere templates, E. coli SSB protein (purified in the JDG laboratory) was added to the DNA at a mass ratio of 10:1 followed by fixation and preparation for EM as above. The grids were examined using Philips CM12 or Philips/FEI Tecnai12 instruments at 40 kV. Images were collected using a Gatan 4kx4k CCD camera or sheet film. Images on film were scanned using a Nikon LS4500 film scanner and the contrast adjusted using Adobe Photoshop software. For glycerol spray/low voltage EM, the 70- and 90-kDa forms of Taz1 were exchanged using a Sephadex G-50 spin column into a buffer containing 40% glycerol and 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, and sprayed as microdroplets onto thin carbon foils. Following sublimation overnight at 1 × 10–7 torr the samples were rotary shadowcast with tungsten and examined in the Tecnai 12 at 16 KV (5Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Production of Full-length and C-terminal Truncated Taz1p— The fractions eluted from the nickel column contained two major bands (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Mass spectrometry analysis (“Experimental Procedures”) revealed that the higher molecular weight protein corresponds to full-length Taz1 (with the hexahistidine tag), whereas the lower molecular weight species corresponds to Taz1p truncated at its C terminus (Taz1pΔC). This truncation is likely because of premature transcription termination, as coupled transcription/translation of the Taz1 gene from a PCR template yielded the same two forms and the proportion of the truncated form did not increase with time, arguing against a possibility that it is a result of specific proteolytic cleavage of the full-length Taz1p (data not shown). The truncation eliminates 107 amino acids including almost the entire Myb DNA-binding domain that is analogous to a dominant negative mutant of TRF2 (Fig. 1B). It would be of interest to assess a possible physiological role of regulation of Taz1p activity by producing the two forms individually in S. pombe. Subjecting the mixture of Taz1p and Taz1pΔC to gel filtration on Superose 6 did not result in separation of the two forms (Fig. 1C). However, we observed that the protein eluted from the column together with apoferritin (440 kDa), indicating that in its native state Taz1p forms a trimer of dimers (3 × (2 × 75) = 450; see also the section “Taz1p Forms Oligomeric Donut Structures”). As the presence of Taz1pΔC in the multimeric complex may change its DNA binding properties, we developed conditions for enrichment of either of the Taz1p forms (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3; see “Experimental Procedures”). Testing both forms by gel-retardation assays using a DNA template carrying 18 fission yeast telomeric repeats demonstrated that in contrast to the full-length Taz1p, Taz1pΔC is unable to form a complex with the probe (Fig. 1D). Generation of Model Telomere—To directly visualize Taz1p interactions with telomeric DNA in vitro, a model DNA containing a fixed number of 5′-GGTTACA-3′ repeats was created by expansive cloning (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 24Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The final plasmid construct (pLT500) carries 74 telomeric repeats (518 bp), which is about twice as long as the telomeric tract on the fission yeast chromosomes (Fig. 2). Although the strategy also yielded a plasmid with 38 repeats (266 bp) where the length of the array is more similar to that of natural telomeres, pLT500 was chosen for electron microscopic (EM) analysis because longer terminal loops would be more easily visualized by EM. As described for the human model telomere (24Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), 3′ terminated ss oligonucleotide tails with different lengths and sequence can be easily ligated to the end of the model DNA. Using E. coli SSB protein as a marker for the presence of a ssDNA tail, EM analysis revealed that >90% of the model telomere DNA molecules contained ss DNA ends. T-loop Formation on a Model Telomere Mediated by Taz1p— The standard template used for this study contains a 49-nucleotide (nt) 3′ overhang, (GGTTACA)7, ligated to the terminus of the model telomere DNA. This substrate was incubated for 20 min with Taz1p using conditions optimized by EM (“Experimental Procedures”). The presence of NaCl (≥100 mm) was required to prevent aggregation of the protein. Concentrations of nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 even as low as 0.025% dramatically reduced the amount of protein bound. Importantly, inclusion of 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol into the reaction increases the proportion of molecules with Taz1p bound within the telomeric track and decreases nonspecific binding. As seen by EM the DNA was present in a variety of forms. First, a fraction of the linear DNA molecules were present with no protein bound (not shown) and the amount of Taz1p added was adjusted so that this ranged between 10 and 35% of the total. At a ratio of Taz1p to DNA of 1 μg of protein: 1 μg of DNA, the most common DNA species consisted of a model telomere with a protein particle located at the very end of the DNA (Fig. 3A, upper left corner). Although Taz1p was identified as a protein with affinity to the ds telomeric DNA of S. pombe, a high fraction of the molecules inspected by EM had Taz1p bound at the very end of the model telomere as opposed to internally along the telomeric tract. These results support a hypothesis that Taz1p prefers a ss/ds telomeric junction over the ds region of the telomere and that this preference might be important for a physiological role(s) of Taz1p, including t-loop formation. The second major species consisted of model telomeres in which one end was folded back into a loop w"

Here we show that this acceleration is due to the induction of a “peptide-receptive” state. Dissociation experiments of soluble HLA-DR2·CLIP (class II-associated invariant chain peptide) complex and peptide-binding studies with “nonreceptive” empty HLA-DR1 and -DR2 molecules revealed that the presence of a small phenolic compound carrying an H-bond donor group (–OH) results in the drastic increase of both off- and on-rates. The rate-limiting step for ligand exchange, the transition of the major histocompatibility complex molecule from a nonreceptive into the receptive state, is normally mediated by interaction with the chaperone HLA-DM. In this respect, the effect of small molecules resembles that of the natural catalyst, except that they are still active at neutral pH. These “chemical analogues” of HLA-DM can therefore modulate the response of CD4+ T cells by editing the antigen composition of surface-bound class II major histocompatibility complex on living antigen-presenting cells.

During the transfer, it fulfills a dual function by also blocking the peptide-binding site to prevent premature peptide loading (3Busch R. Cloutier I. Sekaly R.P. Hammerling G.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In late endosomal compartments, the protein is proteolytically digested, leaving only a short peptide region (CLIP) that remains associated to the peptide-binding groove of the class II MHC molecule. Prior to peptide loading, CLIP has to be removed. This process is catalyzed by HLA-DM (4Kropshofer H. Vogt A.B. Hammerling G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that it involves disruption of conserved H-bonds, which are part of a network connecting the peptide to the binding groove (9Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 68: 465-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Up to now, no crystal structures of HLA-DM·MHC·peptide complexes have been reported, but amino acid substitutions in class II MHC molecules affecting this H-bond network can, at least, indicate a drastic enhancement of spontaneous dissociation rates (10McFarland B.J. Beeson C. Sant A.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3567-3571PubMed Google Scholar). However, HLA-DM-mediated ligand exchange is apparently more complex than just accelerating ligand release. It is known that direct loading of peptides onto empty purified class II MHC molecules is a slow process (9Stern L.J. Wiley D.C.

Once they have lost their ligand, class II MHC molecules quickly acquire a conformational state that renders them “nonreceptive” with regard to their capacity to bind peptides (11Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although the conversion to the nonreceptive form seems to take place rapidly, the transition from the nonreceptive to a peptide-receptive state is very slow. HLA-DM apparently catalyzes this process also. By binding to empty class II MHC molecules, it keeps the complex in a state that permits the rapid exchange of peptides (13Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Kropshofer H. Arndt S.O. Moldenhauer G. Hammerling G.J. Vogt A.B. Immunity. 1997; 6: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that not only HLA-DM but also certain small molecular compounds are able to accelerate ligand exchange reactions on HLA-DR molecules (15Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Esteban V.M. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to HLA-DM, however, small molecular ligand exchange catalysts are effective at neutral pH. They can therefore mediate ligand exchange directly on the surface of living cells and facilitate loading of class II MHC molecules with peptide antigens (15Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Esteban V.M. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or even with full-length proteins (16Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Autoimmun. 2003; 20: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because the presence of an H-bond-forming group appeared crucial for their function, it was assumed that the small molecules, as proposed earlier for HLA-DM, act by disrupting H-bonds. It was still unclear whether their catalytic effect is just because of the accelerated release of bound peptides or whether the functional state of the class II MHC molecule is affected by the small molecule. To address this important question, we compared the catalytic effect of soluble HLA-DM with that of an active small molecule, parachlorophenol (pCP). Peptide release and peptide loading experiments were carried out with soluble forms of HLA-DR using preloaded complexes, or nonreceptive “empty” molecules, as well as with HLA-DR-expressing APC. The major objective was to determine whether the accelerated ligand exchange triggered by small molecules is caused by the induction of a receptive state. Peptide and Chemicals—The small molecular compounds pCP, chlorobenzene (CB), and parachloroanisol (pCA) were obtained from Fluka. Stock solutions of these chemicals were prepared in PBS 10% Me2SO at a final concentration of 100 mm. The peptides IC106–120 (CLIP, KMRMATPLLMQALPM) (17Riberdy J.M. Newcomb J.R. Surman M.J. Barbosa J.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1992; 360: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), IC106–120M107→G (CLIPM→G, KGRMATPLLMQALPM; substituted residue printed in bold letter), MBP86–100 (NPVVHFFKNIVTPRT) (18Zamvil S.S.

For the biotinylated peptides IC106–120 (bCLIP), MBP86–100 (bMBP86–100), and HA306–318 (bHA306–318), the biotin tag was attached to the N termini of peptides, which were extended by a short amino acid spacer sequence (SGSG). Recombinant Soluble HLA-DR and HLA-DM Molecules—Soluble forms of class II MHC molecules HLA-DR1 (DRA1*0101, DRB1*0101) (8Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and HLA-DR2 (DRA1*0101, DRB1*1501) (21Gauthier L. Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Kalandadze A. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), were generated by using constructs lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The molecules were produced in S2 insect cells, stably transfected with vectors encoding truncated MHC α and β chains, and were purified as described by Sloan et al. (8Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). S2 cells expressing HLA-DR1, HLA-DR2, and HLA-DM were provided by Dr. D. Wiley and Dr. K. Wucherpfennig (Harvard University) and Dr. D. M. Zaller (Merck Research Laboratories), respectively. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of Peptide·HLA-DR Complex Dissociation—Preformed HLA-DR2·bCLIP complex was generated by incubating 10 μl of HLA-DR (1 mg/ml) with 0.5 μl of biotinylated CLIP peptide (1 mg/ml) in the presence of 5% ethanol for 18–24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was diluted 1:33 in 100 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20 at pH 7.4. The HLA-DR2·bCLIP complex was coupled to a streptavidin sensor chip surface (BIAcore) via the biotin tag of the peptide by injecting 15 μl of the diluted solution at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Surfaces coated with biotinylated peptide instead of peptide·MHC complex were used as a reference for the dissociation. Dissociation assays were performed at 37 °C in a pH 5.0 buffer containing 28 mm Na2HPO4, 28 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml dextran. Increasing concentrations of HLA-DM (0.3–1.6 μm) followed by increasing concentrations of pCP (0.5–20 mm) were flushed over the surfaces at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The experiments were carried out on a BIAcore instrument according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Peptide Loading of Empty HLA-DR Molecules—To follow the kinetics of HLA-DR1·bHA306–318 or HLA-DR2·bMBP86–100 complex formation, 3 μl of HLA-DR (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated for different times with 0.5 μl of biotinylated peptide (0.01 mg/ml) in the absence or presence of 10 mm pCP or 1.6 μm HLA-DM in a final volume of 8 μl at 37 °C. All reactions were carried out in a phosphate/acetate buffer (100 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm Na-acetate, 150 mm NaCl) adjusted to pH 7.3 for pCP or pH 5.0 for loading reactions with HLA-DM. The reaction was stopped by adding PBS/1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. To compare the effect of pCP with other aromatic compounds, the complex formation reaction was carried out with HLA-DR1 and bHA306–318 in the presence of 10 mm pCP, CB, or pCA for 1 h at 37 °C using the pH 7.3 buffer. Detection of HLA-DR·Peptide Complexes by ELISA—The binding reaction was added to ELISA plates coated previously with an α-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (L243, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The plates were washed and incubated for 0.5 h at room temperature with Eu3+-labeled streptavidin (DELFIA; Wallac) and developed with a fluorescence enhancing solution (15 μm β-naphtoyltrifluoroacetone, 50 μm tri-n-octylphosphine oxide, 6.8 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate, 100 mm acetic acid, 0.1% Triton X-100). The Eu3+ fluorescence was measured in a Victor fluorescence reader (Wallac) using the time-resolved mode at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 614 nm. Generation of a Receptive HLA-DR Molecule by Dissociation of Unstable Peptide Complexes—Unstable peptide·HLA-DR complex was generated by incubating 2.5 μl of HLA-DR1 (1 mg/ml) with 1 μl of the low affinity peptide CLIPM→G (3 mg/ml) in the presence of 5% ethanol for 18 h at 37 °C. The formation of short-lived receptive HLA-DR1 was triggered by diluting the HLA-DR1·CLIPM→G complex with PBS/1% bovine serum albumin to a final volume of 165 μl. The complex was incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots of 25 μl were taken at different time points and incubated with 1 μl of bHA306–318 peptide (1 mg/ml) in the absence or in the presence of 10 mm pCP for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Detection of the complex was carried out by ELISA as described above. Separation of Small Molecules from HLA-DR Molecules with Spin Columns—In some experiments, pCP was removed prior to the binding reaction. For this, empty HLA-DR was preincubated with 10 mm pCP for 30 min followed by passage of the solution through a Micro Bio-Gel P-6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The peptide complex formation was initiated immediately after separation by adding bHA306–318 peptide. Detection of the complex by ELISA was carried out at indicated time points as described above. Antigen Presentation Assay—For antigen-release assays, 106 cells/ml of mouse L243.6 fibroblasts (transfected with the human HLA-DR4 molecule HLA-DRA1*0101, HLA-DRB1*04011 (provided by Dr. E. Rosloniec) (St. Jude Hospital)) were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% fetal calf serum with the indicated amount of CO260–272 or HA306–318 antigen for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 5 × 104 antigen-pulsed cells/well were plated (round bottom wells) and incubated for 4–5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and/or 5% fetal calf serum in the presence of titrated amounts of pCP at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator. After washing the L243.6 cells, HLA-DR4-restricted CO260–272-specific T cell hybridoma hCII23.5 (provided by E. Rosloniec) or HLA-DR4-restricted HA306–318-specific T cell hybridoma 8475/94 (provided by L. Fugger) was added (5 × 104 cells/well). After 24 h, the supernatant was taken and the IL-2 release was determined in a secondary assay with CTL-L cells, as described previously (22Falk K. Rotzschke O. Santambrogio L. Dorf M.E. Brosnan C. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Antigen-loading assays were carried out in the same way, except that L243.6 cells were not pulsed with peptide prior to the pCP incubation but were incubated instead for 4–5 h with pCP together with the indicated amounts of antigen. Release of Class II MHC Peptide Ligands by HLA-DM and pCP—To determine the effect of the small molecule pCP on the dissociation rate of class II MHC·peptide complexes, the release kinetics of bCLIP from soluble HLA-DR2 was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance assays. Preformed HLA-DR2·bCLIP complex was immobilized on streptavidin-coated biosensor chips via the biotin tag of the peptide. Release of HLA-DR was then induced by flushing increasing concentrations of soluble HLA-DM or pCP over the surface to trigger complex dissociation. Loss of surface-bound HLA-DR was detected as a decreased surface plasmon resonance signal and recorded in a sensorgram (Fig. 1). Although the spontaneous dissociation rate of the HLA-DR2·bCLIP complex was determined to be 4.8 × 10–6 s–1, the off-rate (koff) increased in the presence of soluble HLA-DM in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). With 0.3 μm HLA-DM, the off-rate is enhanced 5-fold (2.5 × 10–5 s–1); with 0.8 μm HLA-DM, 8-fold (3.8 × 10–5 s–1); and with 1.6 μm HLA-DM, 12-fold (5.7 × 10–5 s–1). A plot of the HLA-DM concentration versus koff is shown in the inset of Fig. 1A. A similar effect, however, was also observed when HLA-DM was replaced by the small molecule pCP (Fig. 1B). The release of the peptide was accelerated from 3.3-fold at a concentration of 0.5 mm pCP (1.6 × 10–5 s–1) up to 43-fold at a concentration of 20 mm pCP (20.6 × 10–5 s–1), revealing a linear correlation between the off-rate and the concentration of the small molecule (Fig. 1B, inset). Thus, both HLA-DM and pCP trigger the ligand release and increase the off-rate of complex dissociation in a concentration-dependent fashion. Loading of Peptides onto Empty HLA-DR Molecules—The previous experiment demonstrated that the release of peptides bound to class II MHC molecules is, in fact, significantly enhanced by pCP. It was still open to question, however, whether the ligand exchange capacity described for pCP was solely because of this effect or whether the compound could also influence the on-rate of peptide binding. To address this question, loading experiments with biotinylated peptides and empty HLA-DR molecules were carried out in which the amount of complex formed during the incubation was determined by ELISA (Fig. 2). Soluble HLA-DR1 (Fig. 2A, left panel) and soluble HLA-DR2 molecules (Fig. 2A, right panel) were incubated with an excess of high affinity peptides bHA306–318 and bMBP86–100, respectively, in the absence or presence of pCP. In the absence of pCP, the kinetics of the complex formation for both HLA-DR·peptide complexes was rather slow. However, when 10 mm pCP was present, the binding reaction was very rapid. Compared with the noncatalyzed reaction, the relative increase in the amount of peptide complex formed after only 10 min was 9-fold for HLA-DR2·bMBP86–100 and 23-fold for HLA-DR1·bHA306–318. While 10 min was also the estimated half-time for the two catalyzed reactions, the extrapolation of the spontaneous loading curves suggests that more than 5 h are needed in the absence of pCP for both HLA-DR·peptide pairs to reach half-maximal saturation. Thus, pCP cannot only trigger the release of bound ligands but can also accelerate the loading of peptides onto empty HLA-DR molecules. As previously reported (15Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Esteban V.M. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), small molecular compounds seem to require an H-bond-forming group (e.g. –OH) to catalyze peptide exchange reactions. To evaluate the role of this group on peptide loading, two aromatic compounds were tested where the –OH group was either missing (CB) or blocked by a methyl group (pCA) (Fig. 2B). Compared with the control (i.e. spontaneous complex formation), pCP enhances 7.4-fold the amount of HLA-DR1·bHA306–318 complex generated after 1 h of incubation. In the absence of the –OH function (CB), the amount of complex produced is very close to the control, indicating that the catalytic activity of the molecule is impaired by the loss of the –OH group (CB). The same applies when the –OH function is substituted by a methoxy group (pCA), suggesting that the –OH function is required for peptide release as well as for the loading of empty HLA-DR molecules. Induction of a Peptide-receptive State—A slow binding kinetic of peptides to empty HLA-DR molecules is caused by the nonreceptive conformation of the MHC molecule. Up to now, no specific probes or conformation-specific antibodies are available that allow discrimination between nonreceptive and receptive conformers. Induction of receptive forms can only be demonstrated indirectly by rapid binding kinetics as observed, for instance, in the presence of pCP. However, preparations of empty HLA-DR1 molecules from insect cells are potentially, to some extent, contaminated with HLA-DR1 molecules already loaded with peptides. To exclude the theoretical possibility that the apparent rapid loading is influenced by the release of such “endogenous” ligands, kinetic experiments were performed in which the HLA-DR1 preparation was preincubated with the catalysts to remove these ligands prior to the loading reaction (Fig. 3A). Although the loading in the noncatalyzed reaction always remains slow (Fig. 3A, left panel), the presence of HLA-DM results in rapid kinetics of HLA-DR1·bHA306–318 complex formation irrespective of the time point when the bHA306–318 was added (middle panel). Likewise, the same rapid complex formation is also observed when preincubation of the HLA-DR1 preparation was carried out with pCP (Fig. 3A, right panel). Release of ligands apparently does not play a role in the small molecule-mediated increase of the on-rate. “Nascent” receptive MHC molecules can be generated by the dissociation of low affinity peptides (11Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The receptive conformation of the empty MHC molecule, however, is short-lived and switches rapidly into a nonreceptive form. To demonstrate that pCP, in fact, converts nonreceptive MHC molecules back into the receptive form, a low affinity peptide·HLA-DR complex was produced by loading HLA-DR1 with an analogue of CLIP, in which the side chain of the first anchor residue was removed (t½ ∼ 2 h at pH 7.0 for HLA-DR1·CLIPM→G; data not shown) (Fig. 3B). This complex was allowed to dissociate for extended periods of time and was subsequently probed for the presence of nonreceptive HLA-DR1 with an excess of the high affinity bHA306–318 peptide. Upon dissociation of the low affinity peptide, the amount of receptive HLA-DR1 that could be loaded with HA306–318 gradually decreased over time. Without any previous dissociation, the amount of HLA-DR1·bHA306–318 complex produced was equivalent to 49,000 cpm; after 2 h, equivalent to 30,000 cpm; and after 6 h of dissociation, the signal even dropped to 14,000 cpm, corresponding to 30% of the initial value. However, when loading with bHA306–318 was carried out in the presence of pCP, the signal of the HLA-DR1·bHA306–318 complex formed was always ∼90,000 cpm, so that the fraction of nonreceptive HLA-DR generated after the dissociation of the low affinity peptide did not reduce the rate of HLA-DR1·bHA306–318 complex formation. Thus, pCP seems to be able to recover nonreceptive HLA-DR molecules, which are usually not accessible for immediate peptide loading. The reconversion of receptive class II MHC molecules back into the nonreceptive form is reportedly very fast and takes place within minutes (11Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23Vacchino J.F. McConnell H.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This was also evident when pCP was separated from empty HLA-DR molecules by a rapid chromatographic step by spin columns, which required <4 min (Fig. 3C). The fast binding kinetics of bHA306–318 observed in the presence of pCP was completely lost after removal of the small molecule, resulting in the slow binding typical to the reaction of nonreceptive HLA-DR. Importantly, the process is completely reversible, because the addition of pCP resulted again in the fast binding kinetics typical for receptive class II MHC. Influence of pCP on the T Cell Response—Because small molecular ligand exchange catalysts are active at neutral pH (15Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Esteban V.M. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Autoimmun. 2003; 20: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), antigen-release and -loading experiments with pCP were carried out with living APC (Fig. 4). The impact on the T cell response was tested with two antigens that bind to HLA-DR4 with different affinity. In addition to HA306–318 (the high affinity antigen derived from the influenza virus (Fig. 4, right panels)) CO260–272 (an autoantigen derived from human type II collagen that binds to HLA-DR4 with lower affinity (left panels)) was used. The latter is also described as an immunedominant antigen recognized by CD4+ T cells in the collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis model (20Rosloniec E.F. Brand D.D. Myers L.K. Esaki Y. Whittington K.B. Zaller D.M. Woods A. Stuart J.M. Kang A.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2573-2578PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of the small molecule to trigger the release of peptide antigens from the surface of an APC, HLA-DR4-expressing fibroblasts were pulsed with the peptide antigen followed by an incubation with different concentrations of pCP (Fig. 4, upper panels). In a second series of experiments, the impact on antigen loading was tested by incubating APC with pCP together with the peptide (Fig. 4, lower panels). After loading or release of the peptides, the T cell response was determined in an in vitro assay with T cell hybridomas specific for the two peptide antigens. As shown in the upper panels of Fig. 4, the low affinity autoantigen CO260–272 can be removed from HLA-DR4 expressing fibroblast cells by pCP, whereas virtually no release was detected for the high affinity antigen HA306–318. Vice versa, loading of APC with high affinity HA306–318 was greatly enhanced when pCP was present during the incubation with the peptide, whereas little or no effect was observed for CO260–272. Some increase was observed already at a concentration of 0.25 mm pCP, whereas maximal response was reached at a concentration of 1 mm. Apparently, the rapid release of the low affinity peptide prevents efficient loading of the APC. Thus, small molecular compounds can in fact influence the response of CD4+ T cells by affecting the peptide composition on the surface of APC. Similar to HLA-DM, they are able to “edit” the peptide content of HLA-DR molecules according to the intrinsic affinities of their peptide ligands. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which small molecular compounds mediate peptide exchange reactions on HLA-DR molecules. Kinetic analysis revealed that both dissociation of the bound peptide, as well as the binding of the free peptide to the empty binding site, are accelerated. In this respect, the effect of the small molecule indeed resembles that of the natural catalyst HLA-DM. The loss of a single H-bond reduces the binding energy of a peptide ligand by ∼2 kJ/mol, sufficient to trigger release of a low affinity peptide (10McFarland B.J. Beeson C. Sant A.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3567-3571PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that HLA-DM triggers dissociation of peptide·MHC complexes by disrupting such H-bond interactions (5Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Apparently, functional groups capable of forming H-bonds are also required by the small molecules (15Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Esteban V.M. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that the off-rate of low affinity peptide ligands is increased, the true mechanism seems to be more intriguing. In a series of experiments, it could be demonstrated that, independently of peptide dissociation, the on-rate (i.e. the velocity of peptide binding to empty HLA-DR molecules) also is accelerated. Thus, the simple disruption of H-bonds between peptide and MHC by the small molecule is apparently not the driving force behind the accelerated ligand exchange. It has been known for more than 10 years that the formation of a stable class II MHC·peptide complex is preceded by the formation of a short-lived complex characterized by fast on- and off-rates (24Joshi R.V. Zarutskie J.A. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3751-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Sadegh-Nasseri S. Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Germain R.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A conformational transition, evident for instance in the loss of SDS sensitivity, converts this complex into the long-lived form with half-lives that can range on the order of hours or days. More recently, a similar transition was also reported for empty class II MHC molecules (11Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here the short-lived molecule represents the receptive form, whereas the long-lived form represents the nonreceptive form. Ligand exchange therefore seems to take place according to the following scheme. To exchange the peptide P1 with P2, the stable MHC·P1 complex first has to convert into the unstable intermediate complex (MHC rec·P1)* before P1 can dissociate. This dissociation leaves behind the peptide-receptive empty MHC molecule (MHC rec)* that can either convert into the nonreceptive state (MHC nonrec) or acquire the peptide P2 to form the intermediate molecule (MHC rec·P2)*. A second conformational transition finally “locks” the peptide complex and generates the stable MHC·P2 form. The rate-limiting steps in the exchange reaction are apparently the conformational transitions. A recent kinetic study demonstrated that, in particular, the transitions between intermediate and stable peptide complexes are catalyzed by HLA-DM (26Zarutskie J.A. Busch R. Zavala-Ruiz Z. Rushe M. Mellins E.D. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12450-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There are several other reports indicating that HLA-DM is also able to recover the receptive structure of empty class II MHC molecules (13Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Kropshofer H. Arndt S.O. Moldenhauer G. Hammerling G.J. Vogt A.B. Immunity. 1997; 6: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), although according to the study by Zarutzkie et al. (26Zarutskie J.A. Busch R. Zavala-Ruiz Z. Rushe M. Mellins E.D. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12450-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), conversion rates of empty MHC molecules are actually not affected by HLA-DM. It is undisputed, however, that loading of empty HLA-DR1 is drastically enhanced in the presence of HLA-DM. The same enhancement is also observed with the small molecule pCP. Both ligand release and loading of empty MHC molecules is accelerated, implying that here also conformational transitions are catalyzed. So far, inactivation times of receptive class II MHC molecules have been reported for soluble mouse I-Ek (12Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and soluble human HLA-DR1 (26Zarutskie J.A. Busch R. Zavala-Ruiz Z. Rushe M. Mellins E.D. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12450-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as well as for cell surface I-Ek (23Vacchino J.F. McConnell H.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). They were determined by comparing dissociation rates of prebound low affinity ligands with the association rates of high affinity peptides, replacing them and producing t values ranging between 4 and 14 min. Rapid and reversible inactivation was also observed after removal of the small molecule, although binding experiments with high affinity ligands did not reveal any detectable delay in the loss of receptiveness. At present, the specific structural characteristics of intermediate and stable forms of the class II MHC molecule are not known yet. The molecular mechanisms by which HLA-DM or small molecules are driving the transition are therefore still speculative. In the case of HLA-DM, they are likely the result of conformational shifts caused by broad protein/protein interactions between HLA-DM and HLA-DR (27Doebele R.C. Busch R. Scott H.M. Pashine A. Mellins E.D. Immunity. 2000; 13: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Pashine A. Busch R. Belmares M.P. Munning J.N. Doebele R.C. Buckingham M. Nolan G.P.

Med. 2002; 196: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Small molecules, on the other hand, have to induce these transitions by very specific interactions with defined molecular trigger points. Such trigger points could be located in the hydrophobic pockets of the MHC binding site. It has already been shown that point mutations filling the pocket 1 in the peptide-binding cleft induce a state of permanent receptiveness (11Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar, 30Natarajan S.K. Stern L.J. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3463-3470PubMed Google Scholar), and occupation of such a pocket by the hydrophobic aromatic part of the pCP might cause a similar effect. In that case, the –OH group would only have a secondary influence by mediating solubility or assisting the binding. However, alternative trigger points could also be located outside the binding site. For instance, “His buttons,” such as a His-Ile bridge connecting the α1- with the α2-domain, had been described, which control pH-dependent conformational transitions of the MHC molecule (31Rotzschke O. Lau J.M. Hofstatter M. Falk K. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16946-16950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If such a His residue would be the target of the H-bond donor group of the small molecule, the –OH group would play a very active role in the catalytic process, because it would act on the pH sensor similar to an “immobilized” proton. Although HLA-DM and the small molecules share many features with regard to their kinetic effects, a major difference is the influence of pH on their catalytic activity. The activity of HLA-DM almost completely diminishes at neutral pH, whereas the small molecules are still active (15Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Esteban V.M. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). They can therefore alter the peptide repertoire presented by class II MHC molecules on the cell surface. As demonstrated with two peptides (a low affinity autoantigen and a high affinity virus-derived peptide antigen), the small molecule mediates release and loading of T cell antigens according to their intrinsic affinity to the MHC molecule. Thus, they can actually edit the peptide composition presented by an APC, an effect that directly translates into modified T cell responses. Small molecular ligand exchange catalysts might therefore play a role in therapeutic settings as enhancers of antigen loading. They could be employed, for instance, to establish effective tumor-specific immune responses by mediating loading of APC with peptides, proteins, or whole cell lysates derived from the transformed tissue. On the other hand, compounds that influence the antigen repertoire of APC, as described for the model compound pCP, might also represent the environmental risk factors of autoimmune diseases. In vitro, it was already demonstrated that pCP can enhance the presentation of the encephalitogenic MBP protein and induce MBP-specific T cell responses upon incubation with crude spinal cord homogenate (16Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Autoimmun. 2003; 20: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It therefore does not appear unlikely that incorporated chemicals, drugs, or metabolites that mediate such an “accidental” loading of autoantigens onto activated APC could trigger destructive autoimmune responses. Taken together, small molecular compounds, such as pCP, represent chemical analogues of HLA-DM that mimic its catalytic effect on class II MHC·peptide complexes. By accelerating the dissociation of low affinity ligands and stabilizing the receptive state of the MHC molecule, they are able to promote the rapid ligand exchange of class II MHC molecules according to their intrinsic affinity and modulate T cell responses by altering the peptide repertoire presented by APC.

These findings may illuminate the role of PriB in φX-type primosome assembly. A bacterial primosome is a multi-enzyme complex that participates in DNA replication. It travels along the lagging strand template, unwinds the duplex DNA, and primes the Okazaki fragments that are required for replication fork progression (1Schekman R. Weiner A. Kornberg A.

Escherichia coli φX-type primosome was originally discovered as an essential component for the replication of bacteriophage φX174 and ColE1-type plasmids (3Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It is now clear that the primary role of the φX-type primosome is to restart the stalled replication fork at oriC after encountering DNA damage (5Marians K.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

During replication restart, in vitro evidence suggests that the φX-type primosome is located at the D-loop, a three-way-junction DNA structure that is an intermediate in recombination repair, and that PriA initiates the primosome assembly at the D-loop (9McGlynn P.

PriB is one of the seven essential proteins (PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, DnaT, and DnaG) for the assembly of the φX-type primosome for phage φX174 replication (13Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J.

The assembly of a primosome on the φX174 viral DNA, as described in the following sentences, is an ordered process (16Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). (i) PriA recognizes and binds to the pas. (ii) PriB joins PriA to form a PriA-PriB-pas DNA complex. (iii) DnaT then joins this complex to form a triprotein complex on the pas DNA; and (iv) DnaB is then transferred from a DnaB-DnaC complex to the PriA-PriB-DnaT-pas DNA complex to form a preprimosome assembly that consists of PriA, PriB, DnaT, and DnaB on the DNA. Finally, DnaG adds to this complex by interacting with DnaB and completing the primosome assembly (17Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that PriC was not required for the stable preprimosome assembly on the 304-nucleotide pas DNA sequence (16Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

The PriA-directed assembly of the φX-type primosome on the D-loop has been shown to be similar to that on the pas sequence of φX174 viral DNA (10Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

PriB was formerly known as the “n protein” because it can be inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (13Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

PriB can bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the presence or absence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) in vitro (13Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6242-6250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19204-19209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PriB is generally considered to be a structural component of the φX-type primosome. However, the function of this protein in primosome assembly is not fully understood at the molecular level. Recent studies on sequence comparisons and operon organization analyses have shown that PriB evolved from SSB via gene duplication with subsequent rapid sequence diversification (26Ponomarev V.A. Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 5: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SSB has long been known for its importance in DNA replication (27Meyer R.R. Laine P.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 342-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It raises an interesting question as to how PriB participates in DNA replication in a fashion different from that of its ancestor. In this article we present the crystal structure of the E. coli PriB at 2.1 Å resolution. Based on its structural features as well as results from biochemical and mutation studies, we discuss the potential role of PriB in φX-type primosome assembly. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The wild-type priB gene was amplified by PCR from E. coli strain K12. PCR primers were designed to incorporate unique EcoRI and SalI restriction sites, permitting the insertion of the amplified gene into the pET21b vector (Novagen) for protein expression in E. coli. To facilitate the PCR experiment, Gly-103 in the recombinant PriB was substituted with valine by the design of the reverse primer. The resultant plasmid, pET21b-PriB, encodes a recombinant PriB protein fused with an N-terminal T7 tag (MASMTGGQQMGRDPNSL) and a C-terminal His tag (KLAAALEHHHHHH). The T7 tag facilitates the detection of the recombinant protein in primosome reconstitution experiments, whereas the His tag is useful for recombinant protein purification. The coding sequence of this plasmid was further confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were used as host cells for expression of the recombinant PriB proteins. The His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified with a Co2+ chelating column (TALON®, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The eluted protein was dialyzed against the crystallization buffer (0.1 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9) and concentrated to 10 mg ml-1 for crystallization. Crystallization and Data Collection—Both native and sodium p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pHMB) derivative crystals of PriB were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 25 °C. Native crystals grew within 2 weeks after mixing 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg ml-1 in 0.1 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9) with 0.5 μl of 1 m l-cysteine and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ester in 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.7. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 39.32 Å, b = 57.36 Å, and c = 97.02 Å and diffract to 2.1 Å. There are two molecules per asymmetric unit. The native data set was collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image-plate detector (Rigaku, MSC) using copper Kα radiation from a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 80 mA under cryogenic conditions. After an extensive heavy atom derivative search, one useful mercury derivative was obtained by the co-crystallization method under a slightly different condition. Briefly, 2 μl of protein solution was mixed with 0.5 μlof20mm pHMB, 0.5 μlof1 m l-cysteine, and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 25% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.5 and 100 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. The pHMB derivative crystals appeared after 3 days. They share the same space group and similar cell dimensions with the native crystals but diffract only to 2.5 Å. The structure of PriB was determined using multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing (28Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) applied to mercury. The MAD data collection was conducted at the R-AXIS-IV++ imaging plate using a synchrotron radiation x-ray source at Beamline 17B2 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan. The MAD data were collected at four wavelengths under cryogenic conditions. Two energies were chosen near the absorption peak and edge of mercury, 1.00826 and 1.00933 Å, corresponding to the maximum f″ and the minimum f′, respectively. Two remote energies were selected as reference wavelengths in 0.992097 and 1.02493 Å, respectively. Data integration and scaling were performed using the HKL package (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

During refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry neglecting the loop regions was imposed initially but released after two monomers in the asymmetric unit were built. The final model of PriB contains all residues for monomer A and monomer B. The residues preceding position 1 of each monomer are from the T7 tag, and the residues after position 104 of monomer A are from the His tag. The current model has an R-factor of 20.6% for all reflections above 2 σ between 24 and 2.1 Å resolution and an Rfree of 26.3% using 5% randomly distributed reflections. The Ramachandran plot has no violation of accepted backbone torsion angles. The statistical data are shown in Table I. The atomic coordinates of PriB have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1V1Q. Preparation of 32P-Labeled Probes—DNA oligonucleotides 35 bases long, (dT)35 and (dA)35, were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, whereas an RNA oligonucleotide, U35, of the same length was obtained from Dharmacon. RNA I and RNA II carrying a T7 promoter sequence were synthesized using an in vitro transcription system (Riboprobe®, Promega). These probes were 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci mmol-1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The probes were purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gel and resuspended in TE buffer (0.1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8). The concentrations of the 32P-labeled probes were estimated with isotope counting. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To analyze the formation of ssDNA- or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)-PriB complexes, 0.01 pmol of 32P-labeled (dT)35, (dA)35, or U35 was mixed with various amounts of recombinant PriB protein in a 10-μl-reaction mixture containing 40 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin and 100 mm HEPES at pH 7 for 30 min at 25 °C. The resulting samples were resolved on a native 12% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) at 4 °C in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA) and visualized by autoradiography. Complexed and free DNA bands were scanned and quantified. The PriB-ssDNA binding dissociation constants (Kd) were estimated from the protein concentration that binds 50% of the input DNA (34Fairall L. Buttinelli M. Panetta G. Travers A. Buckle M. DNA-Protein Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 65-74Google Scholar). In this report, each Kd is calculated as the average of at least three measurements ± S.D. To assess the binding ability of PriB to RNA I or RNA II, the reactions were carried out by mixing 1 pmol of 32P-labeled RNA I or RNA II with various amounts of recombinant PriB protein in a 10-μl reaction volume for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting complexes were resolved on a native 10% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The Overall Structure of the PriB Monomer—The PriB crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with two molecules in an asymmetric unit. Two identical polypeptide chains form a dimer with a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 1A). A PriB monomer is a single domain protein (residues 1 to 104) topologically identical to the well characterized OB (oligonucleotide-binding) fold (35Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PriB monomer structure has two pleated β-sheets capped by a small α-helix located between the third and the fourth strands to form a β-barrel (Fig. 1B). The core of the β-barrel is filled with hydrophobic residues. Between the anti-parallel strands PriB has three β-hairpin loops termed L12 (residues 20–24), L23 (residues 37–44), and L45 (residues 81–88) that protrude from the central core. Structural comparison of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit reveals that the most significant structural variations between the monomers occur in the regions of the three loops (Fig. 1C). The C terminus (residues 101–104) is located at the tip of the β-barrel and protrudes from the main body of the barrel with considerable variation in its conformation as well. The root mean square deviation between the Cα positions (104 atoms in each monomer involved) in the two monomers is 2.54 Å. Neglecting the C termini and these loop regions decreases the root mean square deviation to 0.55 Å (79 atoms in each monomer involved). Despite the relatively low sequence identity with other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) (Fig. 1D), the PriB monomer displays high structural similarity to the ssDNA-binding domains of E. coli SSB (EcoSSB), human mitochondrial SSB (HsmtSSB), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis SSB (MtuSSB) (36Raghunathan S.

Biol. 2003; 331: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The tracings of the Cα atoms of these proteins are shown in Fig. 1C and demonstrate clearly that the globular core of these proteins has similar conformation. However, unlike other SSBs, the three loop regions of PriB are distinct in their conformation and orientation with respect to the core. Sequence alignment reveals two gaps that significantly shorten the L23 and L45 hairpin loops of PriB (Fig. 1D). L45 of EcoSSB has been shown to be involved in interface interactions between dimers for the one of the tetramer formations (36Raghunathan S. Ricard C.S. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6652-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). L45 of PriB, however, was not stabilized through crystal packing as shown in EcoSSB. Electron density for the tip of L45 is relatively weak and exhibited high atomic temperature factors. Architecture of the PriB Dimer—Both HsmtSSB and EcoSSB function as homotetramers in solution (39Curth U. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Gerberding H. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In contrast to these SSBs, the PriB molecules form dimers in solution (13Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6242-6250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11610-11613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and crystal (Fig. 1A). The two monomers in the PriB dimer are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis that is similar to that of the EcoSSB or HsmtSSB dimer (Figs. 1A and 2). The dimeric interactions of PriB are fairly strong. The intermolecular contacts involve side chains and six short CO· · ·NH main chain H-bonds from β1a of each monomer, which build up the continuity of the three-stranded β-sheets of each subunit. Consequently, a six-stranded anti-parallel pleated sheet extends over the dimer. In addition to the interactions from the intermolecular anti-parallel strands, the arm region (Arg-34 to Trp-47; L23 and parts of the connecting β2 and β3) bends to one side of the paired monomer with intimate contacts involving van der Waals interactions and five hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1A). This close state structural feature is unique and has never been reported for crystal structures of SSBs, even for those that bind with ssDNA (37Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 41Matsumoto T. Morimoto Y. Shibata N. Kinebuchi T. Shimamoto N. Tsukihara T. Yasuoka N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PriB dimer is further stabilized by a symmetrical pair of intermolecular disulfide bridges formed by Cys-48 of one monomer to Cys-80 of the other monomer. These intermolecular interactions have not been observed in other SSBs. In addition to the disulfide bridges, side chains of Met-50 and Met-90 from both subunits form a methionine cluster (Fig. 1A) that locates between the two intermolecular disulfide bridges. Together, the methionine cluster and the disulfide bonds constitute the hydrophobic core of the extended β-barrel in the PriB dimer. Because of the close contact of the arm region of one subunit to the β-barrel of the other (Fig. 1A), the intermolecular interactions of PriB are much stronger than those of EcoSSB or HsmtSSB. The total surface area buried through dimerization in PriB is calculated to be ∼3545 Å2 as compared with that of 2335 and 2894 Å2 for EcoSSB and HsmtSSB, respectively. In addition, over two-thirds (69%) of the buried surface in PriB is contributed by hydrophobic interactions. In comparison, the percentage of the buried hydrophobic surface area is 52 and 54% in EcoSSB and HsmtSSB, respectively. PriB Fails to Form Homotetramers—PriB does not form a tetrameric structure in crystal (this work) or solution (13Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6242-6250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11610-11613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In EcoSSB or HsmtSSB the homotetramer is a dimer of dimers with a 222 symmetry and has molecular 2-fold dyads along three intersecting axes (Fig. 2A). Two β-strands, β1a and β4, are important for the homotetramer formation (36Raghunathan S. Ricard C.S. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6652-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 37Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Residues in β1a and β4 of PriB share only low sequence similarity to those of EcoSSB or HsmtSSB (Fig. 1D). In EcoSSB, a hydrophobic cluster formed by four symmetry-related isoleucine residues (Ile-9) stabilizes the six-stranded β-sheet-mediated tetramer interface (42Webster G. Genschel J. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Hilgenfeld R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, four symmetric His-18 residues in HsmtSSB substitute for those isoleucine residues in EcoSSB. In PriB, however, the corresponding residue is Val-6. The low steric extent of the valine side chains probably cannot stabilize the potential tetramer interface (Fig. 2A). In addition, the charge distribution of PriB at the potential tetramer formation surface is considerably different from that in EcoSSB or HsmtSSB (Fig. 2B). In EcoSSB and HsmtSSB, a pair of charged residues (Lys-7 and Glu-80 in EcoSSB and Arg-16 and Glu-95 in HsmtSSB) form a cluster of intermolecular salt bridges at the tetramer formation surface and lock the orientation of subunits. In PriB, the corresponding Arg-4 and Glu-95/Glu-98 are unable to constitute a similar intermolecular salt bridge cluster such as that of EcoSSB or HsmtSSB. The abundance of negatively charge residues (Glu-58, Glu-95, and Glu-98) on the potential tetramer formation surface may also prevent homotetramer formation in PriB. Possible Roles of the Potential Tetramer Formation Surface of PriB—A priB triple mutant (G56E, H57N, and E58K) has been reported to be defective in the cellular replication of ColE1-related plasmids (23Berges H. Oreglia J. Joseph-Liauzun E. Fayet O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 956-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coincidentally, Glu-58 is located at the potential tetramer formation surface of PriB (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the negatively charged area containing Glu-58, Glu-95, and Glu-98 on the potential tetramer formation surface can possibly be a determinant for protein-protein interaction between PriB and other proteins during primosome assembly. Direct interaction between PriB and EcoSSB has been shown, and this protein complex retains ssDNA-binding ability (13Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6242-6250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, bacterial SSBs from different species can form cross-species heterotetramers through their six-stranded β-sheet surfaces (43De Vries J. Genschel J. Urbanke C. Thole H. Wackernagel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the similar six-stranded β-sheet surfaces of the PriB dimer could interact with an EcoSSB dimer. However, the formation of this heterotetramer has not been reported, and this possibility requires further investigations. Base Preference of Single-stranded DNA Binding of PriB—To assess the in vitro ssDNA binding ability of PriB, purified proteins were incubated with different amounts of 32P-labeled ssDNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assay-type experiments (Fig. 3, A and B). EcoSSB has two major ssDNA-binding modes that occlude 35 ± 2 and 65 ± 3 nucleotides per tetramer (44Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full"
https://openalex.org/W2068315188,"Desulfomonile, Desulfitobacterium, and Dehalobacter are anaerobic microbes that can derive energy from the reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated organic compounds, many of which are environmental pollutants. There is very little information about how anaerobic dehalorespiration is regulated. An open reading frame within the Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans chlorophenol reductase (cpr) gene cluster (cprK) was proposed to be a transcriptional regulatory protein (Smidt, H., van Leest, M., van der Oost, J., and deVos, W. M. (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 5683–5691). We have cloned, actively overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity the D. dehalogenans CprK. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNA footprinting studies, and promoter-lac fusion experiments indicate that CprK is a transcriptional activator of the cpr gene cluster. CprK binds 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate (CHPA) with high affinity (Kd = 3.5 μm, determined by isothermal titration calorimetry), which promotes its specific interaction with a DNA sequence (TTAAT-N4-ACTAA) located upstream of the –35 and –10 promoter regions of several cpr genes and activates transcription of these genes. Binding to the upstream “box” sequence increases the affinity of CprK for CHPA by ∼10-fold (Kd = 0.4 μm, determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays). Chlorophenylacetate, which lacks the ortho-hydroxy group, and hydroxyphenylacetate, lacking the chlorine group, do not activate transcription or promote DNA binding, even at millimolar concentrations, at least 1000-fold higher than the Kd value for CHPA. Lacking metals, CprK is oxygen-sensitive. Oxidation by diamide, which converts thiols to the disulfide, inactivates CprK, and reduction of the oxidized protein by dithiothreitol fully restores DNA binding, indicating that CprK is redox-regulated and is active only when reduced. This is the first reported characterization of a transcriptional regulator of anaerobic dehalorespiration. Desulfomonile, Desulfitobacterium, and Dehalobacter are anaerobic microbes that can derive energy from the reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated organic compounds, many of which are environmental pollutants.

This is the first reported characterization of a transcriptional regulator of anaerobic dehalorespiration. Eleven of the “dirty dozen” persistent organic pollutants that cause lasting damage to animal health and the environment are chlorinated organics, including polychlorinated biphenyls. It appears that no single organism can metabolize these complex organics like Aroclor and that a mixture of aerobes and anaerobes is most efficient (1Ye D. Quensen J.F. II I Tiedje J.M. Boyd S.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 1110-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The halogen group serves as a significant barrier in metabolizing these compounds, and anaerobic bacteria are considered more efficient than aerobes in removing the halogen atoms from the polychlorinated biphenyls (2El Fantroussi S. Naveau H. Agathos S.N. Biotechnol. Prog. 1998; 14: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Several reviews on the microbiology and enzymology of dehalogenation are available (2El Fantroussi S. Naveau H. Agathos S.N. Biotechnol. Prog. 1998; 14: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Copley S.D. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Copley S.D. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Several classes of anaerobic bacteria can use different haloaromatic compounds as electron acceptors and, thus, harvest energy from the reductive dehalogenation reaction (Reaction 1) in a process called dehalorespiration. With pyruvate as the electron donor, Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans generates 1 mol of ATP/mol of chlorine removed through formation of a protonmotive force (7van de Pas B.A. Gerritse J. de Vos W.M. Schraa G. Stams A.J. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In other organisms, less than 1 mol of ATP is gained per chloride liberated (8Holliger C. Hahn D. Harmsen H. Ludwig W. Schumacher W. Tindall B. Vazquez F. Weiss N. Zehnder A.J. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 9Maymo-Gatell X. Chien Y.T. Gossett J.M. Zinder S.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1568-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 strains of anaerobic organisms capable of dehalorespiration have been isolated, including Desulfomonile, Desulfitobacterium, and Dehalobacter. The low G + C, Gram-positive bacterium D. dehalogenans, from which the protein studied here originates, can utilize hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (10Wiegel J. Zhang X. Wu Q. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans dehalogenase can use hydroxy-polychlorinated biphenyls as substrates (11Krasotkina J. Walters T. Maruya K.A. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40991-40997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Multiple gene clusters encoding reductive dehalogenases have been detected in the genomes of dehalorespiring microbes, including 17 potential dehalogenases in Dehalococcoides ethenogenes (12Villemur R. Saucier M. Gauthier A. Beaudet R. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Some of the proteins involved in dehalorespiration are encoded in the cpr (chlorophenol reduction) gene cluster, which includes the reductive dehalogenase (cprA), its membrane anchor (cprB), several proposed chaperonins (cprT,-Z,-E, and -D), and two putative regulatory proteins (cprC and cprK) that are organized into four transcriptional units encoding cprT, cprBA, cprZE, and cprBACD (13Smidt H. vanLeest M. vanderOost J. deVos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Another transcript cprTZE was also detected.R-Cl+2 e−+2 H+→RH+HCl(Eq.1) It is important to understand how dehalorespiring microbes regulate expression of the cpr genes. CprK was suggested to be a transcription regulatory protein based on its sequence similarity to fumarate nitrate regulatory protein (FNR) 1The abbreviations used are: FNR, fumarate nitrate regulatory protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CHPA, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate; HPA, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate; CPA, 3-chlorophenylacetate; CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. and FixK (13Smidt H. vanLeest M. vanderOost J. deVos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which are a global activators of gene expression that control transcription initiation in response to oxygen limitation (14Spiro S. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 6: 399-428PubMed Google Scholar). CprK also exhibits similarity to the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which controls catabolite repression by activating transcription at over 100 different promoters in Escherichia coli (15Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRP and FNR regulate transcription by recognizing and binding a 22-base pair binding sequence upstream of target promoters, which is known as the “FNR box” (16Li S.F. DeMoss J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13700-13705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Li B. Wing H. Lee D. Wu H.C. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The upstream promoter region of the four cpr transcripts contains an “FNR-like box” that overlaps the “minus 35” region (13Smidt H. vanLeest M. vanderOost J. deVos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest CprK is a transcriptional regulator of respiration on chloroaromatic compounds. However, unlike FNR, CprK lacks any obvious motifs for FeS clusters (13Smidt H. vanLeest M. vanderOost J. deVos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which makes it similar to FixK. On the other hand, CprK does show an unusually high content of five cysteine residues, among which is a conserved internal cysteine residue (Cys105). In the E. coli FNR protein, the corresponding Cys122 has been shown to be essential for iron binding, disulfide bond formation, and covalent modification (18Green J. Sharrocks A.D. Green B. Geisow M. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we have used in vitro and in vivo approaches to demonstrate that CprK is indeed a transcriptional activator, demonstrated the specificity of its effector domain, revealed redox activation of CprK, and addressed the role of the “FNR-like box.” Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli strains used were Topo10 and JM109 (Invitrogen) for construction and maintenance of plasmids, Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI) for overexpression of His-CprK and LMG194 (Invitrogen) for β-galactosidase assays. Vectors used include phagemid pGEM-5Zf (Promega, Madison, WI), pQE60 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), plasmid pRS551, which was provided by Professor Jorge Escalante-Semerena (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The chemical reagents used here were purchased from Sigma, and the N2 (99.998%) was from Linde (Lincoln, NE). E. coli cells were grown in Terrific Broth (1.2% tryptone, 2.4% yeast extract, and 0.4% glycerol supplemented with 1× TB salts (2.3% KH2PO4, 12.5% K2HPO4)), except for LMG194, which was grown in RM medium + glucose (1× M9 salts (0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.05 NaCl, 0.1% NH4Cl) at 37 °C. For anaerobic growth of E. coli, we used LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 40 mm sodium fumarate, 1% glucose, 20 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 100 μm sodium sulfite. Antibiotics were used at final concentrations of 100 μg/ml for ampicillin, 25 μg/ml for kanamycin, and 34 μg/ml for chloramphenicol. Cloning and Overexpression of CprK—General DNA isolation and manipulation were performed using standard techniques (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified with a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). To obtain a PCR template, a 0.5-ml aliquot of an actively growing Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans culture was centrifuged, washed, resuspended, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged to remove debris, and 1 μl of the supernatant was used as amplification template. The overexpression construct was produced by first PCR-amplifying the cprK coding region with PfuTurbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following primers: cprK1 (5′-GATGCCATGGCAATGTCTGCT-3′) and cprK2 (5′-GAAGATCTGTAATAGTAGGACGT-3′) (start and stop codons are italicized, and introduced NcoI and BglII restriction sites, respectively, are underlined and shown in boldface type). The PCR product was blunt end-ligated in a TA vector and transformed into Topo10 cells. After the insert was sequenced, the insert was digested and cloned into the NcoI and BglII sites of the pQE60 C-terminal His tag overexpression vector (Qiagen) so that the cprK gene and the C-terminal His tag were in frame generating pQE60::cprK. Purification of CprK—Cell extracts were prepared from Rosetta (DE3) cells carrying pQE60::cprK. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 14-liter fermentor under aerobic conditions in TB medium. When the cells reached an A600 of 1.0, freshly prepared isopropyl-thio-β-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce CprK synthesis, and cells were incubated for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen immediately in liquid N2. Anaerobic growth of E. coli was performed in LB medium supplemented with 40 mm sodium fumarate and 1% glucose. After harvesting, the cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen in a Vacuum Atmospheres anaerobic chamber maintained at below 1 ppm O2 concentration. All subsequent steps were carried out at low temperatures (12 °C under anoxic conditions or 4 °C under aerobic conditions). To purify CprK, the cells were resuspended (5 ml/g weight, wet cells) in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), sonicated at a power setting of 55 watts for 15 min with a program of 30 s on, 30 s off. The suspension was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman 35 Ti rotor for 30 min, and the supernatant, containing CprK, was decanted. After assaying for DNA binding activity, CprK was purified by loading this cell extract on a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) (Qiagen) followed by washing with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and eluting with a gradient from 20 to 250 mm imidazole according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purification steps were performed in the glove box under anoxic conditions at 12 °C or in a cold room under aerobic conditions at 4 °C. Determination of Protein Concentration and Purity—Protein concentrations were determined using the Rose Bengal method (20Elliott J.I. Brewer J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The purity of CprK protein preparations was estimated by SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The N-terminal protein sequence was determined by the Center for Biotechnology Proteonomics Research Core Facility at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. The protein mass was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with a QStar XL (quadruple/time and flight) by the Mass Spectrometry Core Facility at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. DNA Sequencing—The DNA sequences of all PCR-generated DNA fragments were confirmed by automated sequencing of both strands by the Genomics Core Research Facility (University of Nebraska, Lincoln) with a Beckman/Coulter CEQ2000XL eight-capillary DNA sequencer using dye terminator chemistry. Gel Retardation or Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—A 193-bp fragment containing the CprB promoter region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers PcprB1 (5′-GATATCGGAATAGTCGACCCGGCCAAGG-3′) and PcprB2 (5′-GATATCTCCACCTCTCTTTGTAAGGCAATTA-3′) (the introduced EcoRV site is shown in boldface type). The PCR product was inserted into the EcoRV site within the multiple cloning site of the pGEM-5Zf(+) vector, resulting in pGEM::PCprB. Then, the 193-bp EcoRV fragment was excised from pGEM::PcprB and 5′-end-labeled by [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and used in a gel retardation assay (EMSA). Smaller DNA fragments were generated using the procedure described above and the following primers: PcprB3 (5′-GATATCGGGCATTGCTTCCATCCTTT-3′) and PcprB2 from above for a 140-bp fragment containing the CprB promoter region; PcprB4 (5′-GATATCGAATACATCACAAGTATTAGTGC) and PcprB3 for a 90-bp fragment; PcprB5 (5′-GATATCAGAAATTCAGATAAAAGTTAATAC) and PcprB2 for a 100-bp fragment; and PcprB4 and PcprB5 for a 50-bp fragment. All of the above primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The reaction mixture contained gel shift binding 1× buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), final concentrations), CHPA (Sigma), and purified CprK. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 32P-labeled DNA fragment PcprB was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were separated by electrophoresis in 4% or 10% polyacrylamide native gels (pre-electrophoresed for 1 h with thioglycolic acid to remove any oxidants remaining in the gel) buffered with 1× Tris glycine-EDTA (50 mm Tris-HCl, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.2) and run at 140-V constant voltage, followed by drying and autoradiography. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Experiments—For ITC experiments, purified CprK was dialyzed against 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were degassed by vacuum aspiration for 5 min prior to loading, and all titrations were performed at 25 °C. Calorimetric assays were performed using a MicroCal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The reaction cell (∼1.4 ml) was filled with a 0.046 mm degassed solution of CprK. The titrated ligand CHPA (0.5 mm, initial concentration) was dissolved in the same buffer as the CprK dialysis buffer. The stirring speed was 300 rpm, and the thermal power of 60 injections of 3 μl was recorded every 240 s. Thermogram analysis was performed using the Origin 7.0 software supplied with the instrument. Construction of Strains for lacZ Reporter Assays—To measure its in vivo activity under tight control of expression, cprK was cloned in a pBAD-Myc-HisA expression vector (Invitrogen), generating pBAD/Myc/HisA::cprK. A fusion between the promoter region of cprB and lacZ was generated by cloning the promoter region in the EcoRI cloning site of pRS551 (22Simons R. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) to yield pRS551::PcprB, which was transformed into the ara–E. coli strain LMG194 (Invitrogen). Then pBAD/Myc/HisA::cprK was transformed into LMG194 cells containing pRS551::PcprB to generate a two-plasmid reporter system. A tagless version of this reporter system was created by cloning CprK in the same vector and including the native stop codon before the His tag sequence. The pBAD system provides tight control of CprK expression (23Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3959) Google Scholar), and the E. coli strain provides a background that lacks dehalorespiration genes. Transformants were grown aerobically at 37 °C in RM medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin and 10 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Promoter activity was measured by the β-galactosidase activity as described (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Miller, J. H. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of CprK—The conserved Cys105 residue was mutated to alanine using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene. The pBAD/Myc/HisA::cprK plasmid was the template for PCRs using the following primers from Integrated DNA Technologies: 5′-TATGGAACAGACAAGGACAGCCTGGTTTTCCGAAGAATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATTCTTCGGAAAACCAGGCTGTCCTTGTCTGTTCCAT-3′ (reverse). Quantification of Soluble CprK in the in Vivo lacZ Reporter Assays—Quantification of CprK in cultures used in the β-galactosidase assays was accomplished by Western blotting and densitometric analysis. Aliquots equal to 1 ml of a culture in exponential growth phase with an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0 were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in SDS denaturing buffer and loaded on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels along with known quantities of purified His-tagged CprK. After electrophoresis, protein was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and reacted with rabbit antibody against CprK (obtained from Cocalico Biologicals Inc., Reamstown, PA) that had been purified using an Actigel ALD Superflow affinity column (Sterogene Bioseparations Inc., Carlsbad, CA) that had been reacted with CprK. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). CprK was quantified using a Bio-Rad universal hood and Quantity One software. The amount of CprK in each sample was measured by comparing the densitometry-determined staining intensity of the CprK band from the culture with that of the standard protein. To calculate the number of molecules/cell, we assumed that a culture with an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0 contained 109 cells/ml. To assess the amount of soluble versus insoluble CprK, a separate sample of the exponentially growing cultures was centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.05% NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4), and lysed by incubation with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice and then sonication (1.5-min total sonication time at 40 watts using 1-s pulses with 5-s intervals) and centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellet fraction was washed with lysis buffer and centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and the wash and supernatant were combined. The pellet fraction was solubilized in SDS denaturing buffer, and the two fractions (supernatant and solubilized pellet) were loaded onto 15% SDS gels. Western blotting and densitometric analysis were performed as described above to determine the percentage of soluble and insoluble CprK. DNase I Footprinting—DNase I footprinting assays were performed by digesting end-labeled plasmid pGEM::PcprB containing the cprB promoter region with either NcoI or SpeI and end labeling at the 5′ ends by the T4 polynucleotide kinase exchange reaction with [γ-32P]ATP, followed by digestion with the other restriction enzyme (SpeI or NcoI). This protocol generates fragments labeled at only one end. After isolation and purification, the labeled fragment was incubated with CprK as described for the EMSA and digested with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I as described by the manufacturer's guidelines (Promega). After quenching the reactions with EGTA, the DNA was precipitated, resuspended, heat-denatured, and separated on a 7 m urea-8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The DNA sequencing ladder was generated by the dideoxy chain termination method (25Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) with a T7 Sequencing Kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), loaded beside the corresponding footprinting reactions. Cloning and Overexpression and Purification of CprK—To study the mechanism by which expression of the dehalorespiration genes is regulated, we overexpressed and purified the putative transcriptional regulatory protein CprK. The cprK gene from D. dehalogenans was PCR-amplified and cloned in frame with a C-terminal His6 tag in the pQE60 vector, transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells, and grown aerobically in Terrific Broth medium. Recombinant CprK was then purified with an Ni2+-NTA column to more than 98% homogeneity (Fig. 1). Purified CprK exhibits the expected molecular mass of 28 kDa based on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and the expected N-terminal sequence for the first 10 amino acids. The molecular mass determined by mass spectroscopy, 27,947.1 ± 2.7 Da, was also in agreement with the expected value. Based on gel filtration experiments, the protein is predominantly in a homodimeric state, but significant amounts of the monomer (∼30%) are observed, indicating a dynamic equilibrium between the monomeric and dimeric forms (data not shown). UV-visible spectroscopic studies indicate that CprK does not contain a chromophore with an absorption spectrum in the 300–640-nm region. Based on 30-element inductively coupled plasma-emission spectrometry (Chemical Analysis Laboratory, University of Georgia, Athens, GA) (26Jones Jr., J.B. Commun. Soil Sci. Plant Anal. 1977; 8: 349-365Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which includes all metals known to be present in enzymes, the only metal found was zinc, and this was present in only substoichiometric amounts (0.2–0.3 per mol). However, as described below, zinc does not appear to be required for activity. CprK- and CHPA-dependent DNA Binding—To test whether CprK binds the “FNR-like” box in the promoter region of the cpr genes, as predicted by nucleotide sequence analysis (13Smidt H. vanLeest M. vanderOost J. deVos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), EMSAs were performed with CprK and a 193-bp DNA fragment containing the promoter region of the cprB gene from position –156 to +37. Compared with free DNA, the position of the DNA band is significantly retarded when incubated with CprK and the dehalorespiration substrate CHPA (Fig. 2). In the absence of CHPA or CprK, there is no gel shift. Initially, the EMSAs were unreliable, with only freshly purified protein appearing to be active. The EMSA results became highly reproducible after it was recognized that the aerobically purified protein is inactive and that even anaerobically purified protein loses activity within a day after exposure to oxygen when no reducing agent is present. On the other hand, anaerobically purified enzyme that is maintained free of oxygen retains activity for at least 8 weeks without noticeable loss in activity in the EMSAs. Furthermore, the aerobically purified protein regains full activity upon incubation with 2 mm dithiothreitol, which is a reducing agent. Further studies of the redox regulation of CprK are described below. To determine the specificity of CprK for its effector, several potential analogs of CHPA, which is a terminal electron acceptor for D. dehalogenans, were compared in EMSAs. Although CprK exhibits significant sequence similarity to CRP, including the region within the effector (cAMP) binding domain, cAMP does not promote a gel shift (Fig. 2), and elevated levels of cAMP do not inhibit the gel shift induced by CHPA (data not shown), indicating that cAMP does not bind to the effector domain of CprK. At 0.5 mm concentrations, hydroxyphenylacetate, which is structurally related to CHPA but lacks the ortho-chlorine group, chlorophenylacetate (which lacks the hydroxyl group), and pentachlorophenol lacking the carboxyl group (Fig. 2) do not induce DNA binding by CprK. Chlorohydroxybenzoate (0.5 mm) appears to act as a weak effector relative to CHPA. The intensity of the gel-shifted band depends on the concentration of CprK (Fig. 3) and CHPA (Fig. 4). The Kd for CprK of 190 nm indicates a strong interaction with DNA. At very high concentrations of CprK, a “supershift” is observed (data not shown), which presumably originates from a CprK-DNA complex involving oligomeric states of CprK. By varying the concentration of CHPA, a dissociation constant of 0.40 μm can be calculated (Fig. 4), which indicates a very strong protein-effector interaction.Fig. 4Determination of the binding constant for CHPA. Phosphorimaging software was used to quantify the amount of DNA bound by CprK, which was plotted as a function of CHPA concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since the EMSA assays are performed in the presence of DNA, the Kd that is determined reflects the binding of effector to form a ternary (CHPA-CprK-DNA) complex. To obtain more quantitative information about formation of the binary CHPA-CprK complex, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed (Fig. 5). CHPA binding to CprK is exothermic. The apparent Kd was 3.5 ± 0.4 μm with a stoichiometry ranging from 0.55 to 0.84 CHPA per CprK monomer, indicating that the His-tagged protein is 55–80% active, at least in terms of effector binding. Based on comparing the Kd values from the ITC (binary complex) with the EMSA (ternary complex) results (Fig. 4), it appears that DNA increases the binding affinity of CprK for CHPA by ∼10-fold. In Vivo Activity of CprK with a Promoter-lac Fusion—To complement the in vitro DNA binding experiments, we tested the transcriptional activity of CprK in vivo by assaying the β-galactosidase activity of a lacZ fusion with the cprB promoter (Fig. 6). In this construct, CprK is provided by the tightly regulated pBAD plasmid, which is induced by arabinose, and the P(cprB)-lacZ fusion is present on another plasmid. β-Galactosidase activity is induced by CHPA with a concentration dependence that closely matches that determined in the EMSA experiments (<1 μm half-maximum activity).

In a search for proteins specifically interacting with human sGC, we have identified the multidomain protein AGAP1, the prototype of an ArfGAP protein with a GTPase-like domain, Ankyrin repeats, and a pleckstrin homology domain. AGAP1 binds through its carboxyl terminal portion to both the α1 and β1 subunits of sGC. We demonstrate that AGAP1 mRNA and protein are co-expressed with sGC in human, murine, and rat cells and tissues and that the two proteins interact in vitro and in vivo. We also show that AGAP1 is prone to tyrosine phosphorylation by Src-like kinases and that tyrosine phosphorylation potently increases the interaction between AGAP1 and sGC, indicating that complex formation is modulated by reversible phosphorylation.

Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar). These effects are mostly mediated by NO-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGC) converting GTP into the second messenger, cGMP, which, in turn, regulates downstream effectors such as kinases, phosphodiesterases, and ion channels (2Münzel T.

Mammalian sGCs are obligate heterodimers consisting of an α and β subunit each (5Harteneck C. Koesling D. Söling A. Schultz G. Böhme E.

Because sGC is one of the key regulators of intracellular cGMP levels, its activity is under tight control. On the translational level, sGC expression is down-regulated, e.g. in aging cells (8Bauersachs J. Bouloumie A. Mülsch A. Wiemer G. Fleming I. Busse R. Cardiovasc.

On the protein level, allosteric activation via NO governs the activity of sGC. Also, homodimerization and heterodimerization may play a role in regulating sGC activity (11Zabel U. Häusler C.

The expression of alternatively spliced variants or isoforms of the β subunit may help modulate cellular cyclase activity through targeted degradation of sGC (14Zhou Z. Gross S. Roussos C. Meurer S.

Serine/threonine phosphorylation of sGC has also been demonstrated, yet the effects on sGC activity appear to be moderate (16Louis J.C. Revel M.O. Zwiller J. Biochim. Biophys.

For instance binding of the α2β1 isoform to PSD95 targets sGC to the postsynaptic complex in close proximity to neuronal NO synthase and cGMP-dependent effectors, thereby optimizing cGMP generation and signal propagation at the subsynaptic membrane (19Russwurm M.

Although appealing, many of these hypotheses still await experimental proof in vivo.ADP ribosylating factors (Arf) are a subfamily of GTP-binding proteins within the Ras superfamily and are involved in the regulation of membrane traffic and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (21Turner C.E.

Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar), and their activity is regulated through the differential action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). At least 16 distinct types of ArfGAPs are presently known that have been categorized in three major families, i.e. the ArfGAP1 type, the Git type, and the AZAP type (24Yoon H.Y. Jacques K. Nealon B.

We demonstrate that AGAP1 associates with both the α1 and β1 subunits of sGC and that complex formation between these proteins is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Association with AGAP1 does not affect the enzymatic capacity of sGC nor does it alter its NO sensitivity. We propose that AGAP1, by binding to sGC, may help regulate the intracellular distribution of sGC and thus the local delivery of cGMP in mammalian cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were both obtained from PAA (Pasching, Austria); cell culture plastic-ware was from Greiner (Frickenhausen, Germany); ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents and glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B came from Amersham Biosciences; monoclonal antibodies to hemagglutinin (anti-HA.11) were purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA); monoclonal anti-GFP (clone B-2), anti-c-Src (clone H-12), and protein A/G PLUS-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine anti-PY (Tyr(P)-100) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); the human placenta MATCH-MAKER cDNA library came from BD Biosciences; PP2 was bought from Calbiochem; and Complete protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science.

König P. Wohlfart P. Schroeder C. Kummer W. Müller-Esterl W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for the catalytic (cat) and regulatory (reg) domains of the human sGC α1 and β1 subunits, respectively, i.e. α1reg (amino acid positions 1–419), α1cat (466–690), β1reg (1–348), and β1cat (404–619), were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pEG202 vector to create fusion proteins with the LexA DNA-binding domain. pEG202-α1cat was introduced in EGY48 (MATα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2::6LexAop-LEU2) containing the reporter plasmid pSH18–34, and a human placenta MATCHMAKER cDNA library fused to the B42 activation domain was screened. Interactions were validated by growth and blue coloring on minimal agar plates lacking histidine, tryptophan, uracil, and leucine but containing 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and 80 μg/ml X-gal, buffered at pH 7.Antibody Production—Antibodies to the α1 (AS587) and β1 subunits (AS566) were raised in rabbits using peptide sequences unique to human sGC α1 (positions 94–121) and β1 (positions 593–614), respectively. Antibodies against the regulatory domain of human sGC α1 (positions 1–419) or the catalytic domain of β1 (positions 404–619) were raised by immunizing rabbits (AS558 and AS556, respectively) or mice (AS613, AS614) with the corresponding GST fusion proteins. Antibodies to human AGAP1 (hAGAP1) were raised in rabbits to peptides DER25 (positions 775–799; AS627) and SPK23 (460–482; AS625). The antibodies were affinity-purified using the respective peptides coupled to Affi-Gel-10 following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).Northern Blotting—A human multiple tissue 12-lane MTN™ blot was obtained from BD Biosciences, and mouse tissue NBA (normalized by amount of mRNA) blot came from BioChain (Hayward, CA). A cDNA probe covering nucleotide positions 19–287 of the coding sequence of hAGAP1 was 32P-labeled by random priming using the Prime-It® II random primer labeling kit from Stratagene. Northern blots were incubated overnight at 68 °C with the radiolabeled cDNA probe in ExpressHyb™ solution (BD Biosciences).Construction of Expression Plasmids—The cDNAs for the α1 and β1 subunits of human sGC were kindly provided by Dr. Harald Schmidt (University of Giessen, Germany). The coding region for α1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pSG8, a modified version of the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5. The β1 cDNA fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of pEDmtxr. The cDNA clone encoding full-length hAGAP1 (GenBank™ accession numbers NP_055729 and NM_014914) was a generous gift of Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). Data bank searches identified the splice variants hAGAP1α (GenBank™ accession number BC060814) and hAGAP1β (GenBank™ accession number AK001722) as well as the mouse homologue mAGAP1 (GenBank™ accession numbers NP_835220 and NM_178119) and its corresponding gene. For transient expression of AGAP1 or the domains thereof, the corresponding cDNA segments were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.0 modified previously for the expression of N-terminally HA-tagged proteins. For the expression of GFP- or VSV-tagged AGAP1, the coding region was PCR amplified and subcloned into the pSG8 modified previously for in-frame expression of N-terminal tags or into pEGFP. The cDNA for wild type chicken Src (pSG5-Src) and the dominant-negative mutant thereof (pSG5-SrcK-) were generous gifts of Dr. Rudi Busse (University of Frankfurt, Germany). All constructs were subjected to DNA sequencing prior to their use.Transfections—COS-1 cells from African green monkey kidney were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were done with DEAE-dextrane. In brief, a 10-cm dish containing 6 × 105 cells was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and expression plasmids were applied in a 5.7-ml serum-free medium mixed with 300 μl of DEAE-dextrane (1 mg/ml) and 12 μl of chloroquine (50 mg/ml). After incubation for 2.5 h, cells were treated with 10% Me2SO in PBS for 2 min and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 30–48 h prior to use.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—A freshly prepared stock solution of pervanadate (10 mm Na3VO4 and 300 mm H2O2 incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to use) was diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Thirty to forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were incubated for 10–30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 μm pervanadate (final concentration). To inhibit Src family tyrosine kinases, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PP2 for 1 h at the indicated concentrations followed by incubation with 100 μm pervanadate for 30 min. Cells from a 60-mm dish were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice with 0.4 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cellular debris was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with the corresponding antisera for 2 h at 4 °C under rotation. Antibodies were precipitated with protein A/G PLUS-agarose. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) or, when using an antibody to phosphotyrosine, in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS-T and 5% dry milk or PBS-T with 2% BSA for 1 h, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection kit.Tissue Preparation and Immunofluorescence Studies—For immuno-precipitation of AGAP1 or sGC subunits, anesthetized rats were killed, and the respective organs were excised, washed with PBS, and homogenized in immunoprecipitation buffer. After centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min), the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation (see above). For immunofluorescence studies, COS-1 cells were transfected with constructs expressing HA-tagged hAGAP1 and sGC β1. After 24 h cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and incubated with monoclonal anti-HA (Babco) and polyclonal anti-β1 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), followed by the secondary antibodies Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Labeled cells were analyzed with a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Cross-linking Studies—COS-1 cells were co-transfected with GFP- and VSV-tagged AGAP1. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2,and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were lysed by repeated freezing in liquid nitrogen and sonification followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. For cross-linking, DSS was added (final concentration 0.3 mm DSS and 5% Me2SO), and the lysate was incubated for 30 min on ice. Vehicle alone (5% Me2SO) was used as control. The reaction was stopped by adding Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 (final concentration 70 mm), and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-VSV.Sequence Analyses—Sequence comparisons and protein domain and genomic analyses were done with ClustalW, Prosite, Smart, Pfam, BLAST, and Evidence Viewer software, respectively.RESULTSIdentification of a Novel sGC Interacting Protein—To identify proteins interacting with sGC, we employed the yeast two-hybrid interaction trap using the catalytic domain of the α1 subunit (α1cat; positions 466–690) as the bait and a human placenta cDNA library as the prey. In several rounds of screening, we identified a member of the centaurin family of ArfGAP proteins (30Hawadle M.A. Folarin N. Martin R. Jackson T.R. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 247-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), AGAP1 (GGAP1, centaurinγ2, KIAA1099), as a potential binding partner of sGC. To extend these initial findings, we used four distinct baits derived from the α1 and the β1 subunits of sGC, i.e. the α1 regulatory domain (α1reg, positions 1–419), the α1 catalytic domain (α1cat, positions 466–690), the β1 regulatory domain (β1reg, 1–348), and the β1 catalytic domain (β1cat, positions 404–619). Employing the yeast mating assay, we found that the carboxyl terminal portion of AGAP1 (AGAP1399–804) binds to both subunits of sGC. More specifically, AGAP1399–804 binds to the catalytic domain of α1 and to the regulatory domain of β1 but not to the α1 regulatory or β1 catalytic domains (Fig. 1A).hAGAP1 is a multidomain protein of 804 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 89 kDa (27Nie Z.

AGAP1 is the product of a single gene of 19 exons on human chromosome 2, E1 through E19 (Fig. 1B). Through alternative splicing at least three products emerge, namely AGAP1 (E1–9, E11 and 12, and E14–19), AGAP1α (E1–10) (31Strausberg R.L. Feingold E.A. Grouse L.H. Derge J.G. Klausner R.D.

Genet. 2004; 36: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The mouse homolog, mAGAP1, is encoded by a gene of 19 exons located on mouse chromosome 1. The cloned mRNA retained exon 13, endowing mAGAP1 with an extra segment of 53 residues within the center part of the split PH domain, thus totaling 857 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 94 kDa (Fig. 1C). On the protein level, mAGAP1 and hAGAP1 have 91% sequence identity.AGAP1 mRNA Expression Patterns—We investigated the expression patterns of the hAGAP1 and mAGAP1 genes by Northern blot analyses of various tissues and organs (Fig. 2, A and B). To this end, we constructed a 32P-labeled cDNA probe covering nucleotide positions 19–287 of the coding sequence of hAGAP1. Transcripts of ∼4.4 kbp were found for both messages, which is in reasonable agreement with their predicted sizes of 4078 bp (human) and 4234 bp (mouse). In human tissues, AGAP1 mRNA was present in the skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta as well as in the brain, heart, colon, and lung (Fig. 2A). Low expression levels were found in the spleen, liver, and small intestine, whereas thymus and peripheral leukocytes failed to show significant AGAP1 mRNA levels. In the mouse, AGAP1 mRNA was prevalent in brain and kidney and present in heart, lung, spleen, and small intestine, whereas the level in skeletal muscle was below background (Fig. 2B). The distribution patterns observed for AGAP1 overlap largely with the known sGC α1 and β1 mRNA expression patterns in man and mouse (33Budworth J. Meillerais S. Charles I. Powell K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Mergia E. Russwurm M. Zoidl G. Koesling D. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the brain, but also in skeletal muscle and the heart of both species, we found a strong additional signal of 2.4 kbp corresponding to the splice variant AGAP1α with a predicted size of 2184 bp (Fig. 2, A and B). Because of the high sequence identity among centaurins, our probe also detected a 3.2-kbp transcript of the AGAP3 gene (MRIP1, centaurin γ3), which is in perfect agreement with the predicted size of 3123 bp for the corresponding mRNA (GenBank™ accession number AF359283).Fig. 2AGAP1 mRNA expression pattern. Northern blot analyses of AGAP1 in human (A) and murine tissues (B). Equal amounts of human (1 μg per lane) and murine (3 μg per lane) poly(A)+ mRNA were hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe covering nucleotide positions 19–287 of the coding sequence of hAGAP1. Two major messages of 2.4 and 4.4 kbp are detected corresponding to AGAP1 and AGAP1α, respectively. Because of extensive sequence homology, the probe also recognized the message for AGAP3 (MRIP1 or centaurin γ3) of 3.2 kbp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)AGAP1 and sGC Protein Expression Patterns—We examined the expression of AGAP1 on the protein level (Fig. 3). To this end we produced the antisera AS625 and AS627 raised against synthetic peptides covering positions 460–482 and 775–799, respectively, of hAGAP1 and tested them in native and transfected cells of human, monkey, and rodent origin. AS627 immunoprecipitated recombinant HA-tagged hAGAP1 with an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa from transiently transfected COS-1 cells, whereas the corresponding pre-immune serum failed to precipitate a band of similar size (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the antibody AS627 precipitated endogenous AGAP1 of 97 kDa from lysates of HEK-293 cells derived from human embryonic kidney (Fig. 3A) and from lysates of HeLa cells, but not from lysates of endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cells (not shown), demonstrating that these cells endogenously express AGAP1. Antiserum AS627 efficiently cross-reacted with the rat homologue rAGAP1 (100 kDa) in lysates of native PC-12 cells (Fig. 3A). In addition to the 100-kDa protein, which likely represents the full-length form of rAGAP1, AS627 immunoprecipitated a minor 97-kDa protein band that may represent the product of a differentially spliced mRNA in which the exon 13 not present in the human homolog has been skipped (Fig. 1C). Alternatively, the 97-kDa band may reflect a proteolytic break-down product of rAGAP1; we have not tested these possibilities further. Using lysates from rat tissues, we immunoprecipitated rAGAP1 of 100 kDa (major) and 97 kDa (minor) from the heart, brain, lung, and thymus, whereas rAGAP1 was not detectable in the kidney and liver (Fig. 3B, top).Fig. 3AGAP1 protein expression pattern. A, immunoprecipitation (IP) from lysates of recombinant HA-tagged hAGAP1 transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, endogenous hAGAP1 from HEK-293 cells, and rAGAP1 from PC-12 cells using anti-AGAP (AS627).

This differentiation process requires spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in the endoderm by a network of tissue-specific transcription factors whose elucidation is far from complete. These factors include the Onecut protein hepatocyte nuclear factor-6 (HNF-6), which controls pancreas and liver development as shown in our previous work on Hnf6 knock-out embryos. In mammals, HNF-6 has two paralogs, Onecut-2 (OC-2) and OC-3, whose patterns of expression in the adult overlap with that of HNF-6. In the present work, we examine the expression profile of the three Onecut factors in the developing mouse endoderm. We show that HNF-6, OC-2, and OC-3 are expressed sequentially, which defines new steps in endoderm differentiation. By analyzing Hnf6 knock-out embryos we find that HNF-6 is required for expression of the Oc3 gene in the endoderm. We show that OC-3 colocalizes with HNF-6 in the endoderm and in embryonic pancreas and liver. Based on transfection, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and whole embryo electroporation experiments, we demonstrate that HNF-6 can bind to and stimulate the expression of the Oc3 gene. This study identifies a regulatory cascade between two paralogous transcription factors, sheds new light on the interpretation of the Hnf6 knock-out phenotype, and broadens the transcription factors network operating during development of the endoderm, liver, and pancreas.

This study identifies a regulatory cascade between two paralogous transcription factors, sheds new light on the interpretation of the Hnf6 knock-out phenotype, and broadens the transcription factors network operating during development of the endoderm, liver, and pancreas. In the mouse, cells in the definitive endoderm differentiate from embryonic day 8 (4–6-somite stage) to form the epithelial lining of the primitive gut and associated organs (reviewed in Refs. 1Wells J.M. Melton D.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar and 2Grapin-Botton A. Melton D.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 124-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These organs arise from the gut by budding into the surrounding mesenchyme. This process requires precise signaling, in time and space, from the mesoderm and the regionalized expression of tissue-specific transcription factors in the endoderm. This unique combination of transcription factors in the endoderm delineates a specific transcriptional network that specifies the presumptive organ territories. For instance, during development of the liver and pancreas, two organs that derive from adjacent endodermal regions, a core endodermal program is constituted by the expression of transcription factors such as the FoxA factors, the GATA factors, Hb9, Pdx-1, Hex, HNF-1, 1The abbreviations used are: HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; OC, Onecut; e, embryonic day; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BMEL, bipotential mouse embryonic liver; CMV, cytomegalovirus.

Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Not all the components of this endodermal program have been identified and the auto- and cross-regulatory loops that control their function are not well understood. Elucidation of this network is required for full understanding of pancreas and liver development and for implementing such knowledge in the controlled differentiation of cells for cell therapy. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6 (HNF-6) belongs to the Onecut (OC) family of transcription factors (5Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

These factors possess a single cut domain, hence their name, and a divergent homeodomain, which are both involved in DNA binding. Onecut proteins have been identified not only in humans and rodents, but also in model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans (6Lannoy V.J. Burglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol.

Dev. 2002; 112: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to Hnf6, mammalian genomes contain two other Onecut genes called Oc2 and Oc3 (9Jacquemin P. Lannoy V.J. Rousseau G.G.

The sequence conservation in their cut and homeodomains suggests that these paralogs may bind the same genes, and indeed many HNF-6 binding sites on DNA are recognized by OC-2 and OC-3 (9Jacquemin P.

As development proceeds, HNF-6 becomes restricted to the liver and the pancreas (11Landry C. Clotman F. Hioki T. Oda H. Picard J.J Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Rausa F. Samadani U. Ye H. Lim L. Fletcher C.F. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 228-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Expression of Oc2 in the endoderm is superimposable to that of Hnf6 (13Jacquemin P. Pierreux C.E. Fierens S. van Eyll J.M. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and later on it is restricted to the liver, pancreas, gut, and stomach. Nothing is known on the endodermal expression of OC-3, but at later stages Oc3 is found in the gut and stomach (10Vanhorenbeeck V. Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the three Onecut factors share partially overlapping expression domains and may be functionally redundant. Inactivation of the mouse Hnf6 gene revealed that it is important for development of the pancreas at the precursor stage in the endoderm (14Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, Hnf6 knock-out embryos display a pancreatic hypoplasia that results from defects in early pancreas specification. Indeed, the onset of Pdx-1 expression is delayed in the endoderm of Hnf6 knock-out embryos, leading to a reduced number of specified cells in the pancreatic territory at the time of budding. Consistent with this, HNF-6 can bind to and stimulate transcription of the Pdx1 gene (14Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the present work, we wished to further characterize the transcription factor network in the endoderm. We have examined the time course of expression of the three Onecut factors in the developing endoderm of normal mouse embryos and have investigated whether inactivation of Hnf6 influences the expression of Oc2 and Oc3. We show here that, in the endoderm of Hnf6 knock-out embryos, Oc2 expression is unaffected, but Oc3 expression is abolished. We demonstrate that HNF-6 can induce Oc3 expression and we provide evidence that this is a direct effect. Our work defines new stages in endoderm differentiation and identifies a paralogous regulatory cascade in the Onecut transcription factors, which operates during differentiation of the endoderm, liver, and pancreas. Animals—The Hnf6 knock-out mice, raised in our animal facility and treated according to the principles of laboratory animal care of the University Animal Welfare Committee, were obtained as described (15Jacquemin P. Durviaux S.M. Jensen J. Godfraind C. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Madsen O.D. Carmeliet P. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Mol. Cell.

Dissection, RNA Purification, and Reverse Transcription-coupled PCR—RNA was extracted from tissues with the Tripure RNA Isolation reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Individual embryos at the 5–14-somite stage were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen) to separate the endoderm layer from the mesoderm and ectoderm. Most of the endoderm, including the hindgut, midgut, and foregut regions, was used for RNA extraction. At e9.5 and e10.5, the region that gives rise to the liver, pancreas, part of the stomach, and gut was dissected from a single embryo. At e12.5, the pancreas or the liver were isolated. Total RNA from transfected cells or from embryos electroporated with plasmid DNA was treated with TURBO DNase I according to the manufacturer (Ambion), to eliminate DNA. Total RNA (up to 1 μg) was reverse transcribed as described (16Clotman F. Lannoy V.J. Reber M. Cereghini S. Cassiman D. Jacquemin P. Roskams T. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P.

Quantitative real time PCR was performed with the SYBR Green PCR Core kit or master mixture (Eurogentec) on a MyIQ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). Treshold cycles were transformed to copy number according to the standard calibration curve. Absolute copy number for each mRNA was normalized to absolute β-actin mRNA copy number. Primer sequences were 5′-TCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGT-3′ and 5′-CTGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAG-3′ for β-actin, 5′-AGCCCTGGAGCAAACTCAAGT-3′ and 5′-TGCATGTAGAGTTCGACGTTG-3′ for exogenous HNF-6, 5′-TTCCAGCGCATGTCGGCGCTC-3′ and 5′-GGTACTAGTCCGTGGTTCTTC-3′ for endogenous HNF-6, 5′-GCATGTCTGCCTTACGCCTG-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATTTCTTCTGCGAG-3′ for OC-2, 5′-CGGAGTTCCAGCGCATGTC-3′ and 5′-GAGAAGGTGGCAGTAGCTGTC-3′ for OC-3, 5′-AAGAGCCCAACCGCGTCCAGC-3′ and 5′-AGTACGGGTCCTCTTGTTTTC-3′ for Pdx-1, 5′-CCTCGTGACCACCCTGAC-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGTAGTGGTTGTCGG-3′ for green fluorescent protein (GFP), 5′-TGAGGTCGACTGAGAGGTTC-3′ and 5′-TGTGCCCCCTGAGCCCCAAG-3′ for Oc3 region a, 5′-AAGTCTGGACAGTCTGCAAG-3′ and 5′-TACCAGCCACCCCGGGATTC-3′ for Oc3 region b, 5′-CAACCCTCTGCCCAGGAATC-3′ and 5′-GCCAGGATCAGAGTCAAGTC-3′ for Oc3 region c. Antibodies and Immunofluorescence—Anti-OC-3 antibodies were raised against the N-terminal moiety of mouse OC-3. Amino acids 23 to 333 of OC-3 were fused downstream of the glutathione S-transferase coding sequence in the pGEX-CS vector (17Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and produced in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was purified using glutathione and extracted from colloidal blue-stained SDS-PAGE before injection to guinea pigs. Their serum was used as a source of anti-OC-3 antibodies. For immunofluorescence, embryos were fixed at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Embryos were embedded and immunofluorescence was detected as described (18van Eyll J.M. Pierreux C.E. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: monoclonal mouse anti-E-cadherin at 1:50 (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-HNF-6 at 1:25 (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Pdx-1 at 1:1000 (a kind gift from C. V. Wright), rabbit anti-Prox1 at 1:1000 (Covance), and guinea pig anti-OC-3 at 1:4000. Primary antibodies were detected by immunofluorescence using biotinylated sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Roche Diagnostics) followed by streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes), using a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Texas Red (Jackson) or using a goat anti-guinea pig antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Sections were analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope. For immunohistochemistry, primary antibodies were detected by immunoperoxidase labeling using biotinylated sheep anti-rabbit or anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and DAB+ (Dako). Pictures were taken using a Coolpix 995 digital camera (Nikon). Cell Culture and Transfections—Bipotential embryonic mouse liver (BMEL) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, insulin-like growth factor II, insulin, and EGF according to Strick-Marchand and colleagues (19Strick-Marchand H. Weiss M.C. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 794-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strick-Marchand H. Moresan S. Charneau P. Kremsdorf D. Weiss M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were transfected, using LipofectAMINE 2000, in 6-well plates for 24 h with 6 μg of the CMV promoter-driven pcDNA3-EGFP (Invitrogen), pCMV-Flag/HNF-6, or pCMV-Flag/HNF-6-VP16 expression vectors. To perform chromatin immunoprecipitation cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes for 26 h with 15 μg of the pCMV-Flag/HNF-6 expression vector. Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Protein extraction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on the same samples from which RNA was isolated with the Tripure reagent. Equal volumes were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels, as protein concentration could not be measured. Western blotting was performed as described (21Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) with anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) or anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—This was performed essentially as described (22Nowling T. Bernadt C. Johnson L. Desler M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13696-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) on 107 BMEL cells transfected with the Flag/HNF-6 expression vector. DNA-protein complexes were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde to the culture medium (final concentration 1%). After 10 min at room temperature, the cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of glycine (final concentration 0.125 m) for 5 min. Cells were washed and harvested by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lyzed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors, and nuclei were collected. Nuclei were lyzed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors, and were sonicated to produce DNA fragments of ∼200 to 1000 bp in length. The samples were centrifuged to eliminate cell debris, and DNA-protein complexes were precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate) for 15 min at 4 °C with rotation. Each sample was then diluted with 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl, an aliquot was removed as “input” control, and the remaining sample was divided into two aliquots. M2 (anti-FLAG; Sigma) antibody was added to one aliquot, and anti-tubulin (Sigma) antibody was added to the second aliquot as a nonspecific antibody control. Samples were incubated with antibody overnight with rotation at 4 °C. The following day, salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads were added to the samples and incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C with rotation to collect DNA-protein-antibody complexes. Beads were washed and DNA-protein complexes were eluted by two successive incubations at 65 °C for 10 min with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm NaHCO3). NaCl (final concentration, 0.3 m) and RNase A were added to the eluted and input samples and incubated at 65 °C for 4–6 h to revert cross-links. Samples were precipitated overnight at -20 °C by addition of 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, resuspended in proteinase K buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% SDS), and treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 45 °C. After this, DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform and chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. PCR was performed on 1/50th of the immunoprecipitated chromatin. Whole Embryo Culture and Electroporation—Whole embryo culture and electroporation have been described in detail. 2C. E. Pierreux, A. V. Poll, P. Jacquemin, F. P. Lemaigre, and G. G. Rousseau, submitted for publication. Briefly, intact e8.5 embryos were incubated in a DNA solution and placed between the electrodes. Electroporation was performed using a square-wave pulse generator (Electro Square Porator ECM 830, BTX). After electroporation, embryos were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in a roller culture system (31 rpm). Electroporated embryos developed normally and were further dissected for RNA extraction or processed for paraffin embedding, as for normal e9.5 embryos. Hnf6, Oc2, and Oc3 Are Expressed Sequentially in the Endoderm—Work from our laboratory has shown that HNF-6 is expressed in the mouse endoderm starting around the 8-somite stage (e8.5) (14Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization experiments have revealed expression of Oc2 in the endoderm of 14-somite (e9) embryos (13Jacquemin P. Pierreux C.E. Fierens S. van Eyll J.M. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). No data are available on Oc-3 expression in the endoderm. To determine the level of expression of the three Onecut factors in the endoderm, we resorted to real time PCR experiments on RNA extracted from endoderm isolated by dispase treatment of the embryos at the 5-somite to the 14-somite stage. We also measured Pdx-1 mRNA as an endodermal marker. As shown in Table I, the three Onecut factors were expressed in the endoderm. HNF-6 mRNA was the most abundant and was clearly detectable at the 5-somite stage. The onset of Oc2 expression was delayed as compared with that of Hnf6, being detectable at the 7-somite stage. Oc3 expression became significant only at the 14-somite stage. On e9.5, expression of Oc3 had increased to the point of reaching about 25% of that of Hnf6 at that stage (Fig. 1A). We conclude from these data that the three Onecut factors become expressed sequentially in the developing endoderm, in the order HNF-6, OC-2, OC-3.Table IExpression of transcription factors in the developing endoderm Endoderm was dissected from mouse embryos at the somitic stages indicated and the RNA was extracted. Real time PCR analysis for the transcription factors listed was performed on the cDNAs. The results, from individual embryos (including two at the 9-somite stage) are expressed as (transcription factor mRNA copy number/actin mRNA copy number) × 106.SomitesTranscription factor mRNAHNF-6OC-2OC-3Pdx-1537NDaND, not detectableND4681NDND10712795ND48917641ND5216909ND93142407212128a ND, not detectable Open table in a new tab Oc3 Expression Is Down-regulated in Hnf6 Knock-out Embryos—As HNF-6 is the first Onecut factor to be expressed in the endoderm, we investigated whether it could regulate the expression of the two other Onecut factors. To this end, we examined the consequences of inactivating the Hnf6 gene. We compared control and Hnf6 knock-out embryos and determined the expression of Oc2 and Oc3 at e9.5 (22 somites) in the primitive gut region that will give rise to the liver, pancreas, stomach, and duodenum, and which corresponds to the HNF-6 expression territory. Whereas the expression of Oc2 was unaffected in the absence of HNF-6, the expression of Oc3 was undetectable as compared with controls (Fig. 1A). Expression of Oc3 in the primitive gut of Hnf6 knock-out embryos was also abolished at e10.5 (35 somites, Fig. 1B) and this persisted in the pancreas and liver at e12.5 (Fig. 1, C and D). We conclude that HNF-6 controls Oc3 gene expression in the endoderm and the developing pancreas and liver. OC-3 Is Colocalized with HNF-6—As a first step to investigate whether HNF6 exerts a direct control on Oc3 gene expression, we verified if the two factors are coexpressed. Sections from 19-somite embryos were examined by immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against HNF-6 and OC-3. To localize the endodermal epithelium and to distinguish it from the surrounding nonepithelial tissues, we used an antibody against E-cadherin, which is a component of the adherens junction complex between epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, HNF-6 nuclear staining was observed in all the endodermal cells in this region. Two adjacent sections stained with the anti-OC-3 antibody revealed nuclear OC-3 expression in cells on the ventral side of the endoderm (Fig. 2, B and C). As nuclei in this region were also positive for HNF-6 (Fig. 2A), we conclude that part of the cell population that expresses HNF-6 also expresses OC-3. To identify the cell types that express OC-3, these sections were costained with antibodies directed against Pdx-1, which labels pancreatic precursors (Fig. 2B), and Prox1, which labels hepatic precursors (23Burke Z. Oliver G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 118: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). OC-3 was widely expressed in part of the ventral prepancreatic region as well as in the prehepatic region. At this stage, OC-3 was not detected in other regions of the endoderm. Thus, around e9.5, OC-3 is expressed in the ventral prepancreatic and prehepatic regions, a territory of the endoderm that also express HNF-6. One day later (32-somite stage), we performed immunohistochemistry for HNF-6 and OC-3, to better identify the developing organs in which they are expressed. HNF-6 protein was detected in the migrating hepatoblasts, gallbladder primordium, ventral and dorsal pancreas, stomach, and duodenum (Fig. 2D). OC-3 protein colocalized with HNF-6 in the migrating hepatoblasts, gallbladder primordium, ventral and dorsal pancreas as well as in some cells of the stomach and duodenum (Fig. 2E). This indicates that OC-3 is expressed in discrete regions of the endoderm were HNF-6 is present. HNF-6 Binds to and Stimulates Transcription of the Oc3 Gene—To determine whether HNF-6 can bind to, and directly stimulate, the transcription of the Oc3 gene, we resorted to cultures of BMEL cells isolated from e14.5 liver as described in Strick-Marchand and colleagues (19Strick-Marchand H. Weiss M.C. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 794-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strick-Marchand H. Moresan S. Charneau P. Kremsdorf D. Weiss M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8360-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These cells have properties of hepatoblasts, as they can differentiate toward the hepatocytic or biliary lineages (19Strick-Marchand H. Weiss M.C. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 794-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strick-Marchand H. Moresan S. Charneau P. Kremsdorf D. Weiss M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8360-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). They express the three Onecut transcription factors and can be transfected with high (close to 80%) efficiency. Moreover, we found that Hnf6 knock-out BMEL cells express five times less Oc3 than wild type cells (data not shown). We first examined if HNF-6 could stimulate endogenous Oc3 gene transcription. Cells were transfected with a GFP expression vector, as a control, or with Flag/HNF-6 or Flag/HNF-6/VP16 expression vectors. Total RNA was extracted 24 h later and reverse transcribed to measure endogenous Oc2 and Oc3 expression levels by real time PCR (Fig. 3A). Oc2 and Oc3 expression was the same in cells transfected with the GFP expression vector as in nontransfected cells (data not shown). Expression of GFP, Flag/HNF-6, and Flag/HNF-6/VP16 in the cells was assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Transfection of the expression vector coding for HNF-6 did not influence Oc2 gene expression (Fig. 3A, top panel). In contrast, the expression levels of Oc3 in the cells transfected with HNF-6 were about five times those in the control (GFP-transfected) cells and even higher when a HNF-6/VP16 fusion protein was expressed in the cells (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). This indicates that HNF-6 can specifically stimulate transcription of the Oc3 gene, without affecting transcription in general. We then searched for HNF-6 binding sites in regulatory regions of the Oc3 gene. Comparison of the human and mouse genes revealed sequence conservation over about 1 kb upstream (-2880 to -1950 from the ATG) of the coding sequence. This region contains three conserved HNF-6 binding consensus sequences (Fig. 3C). To test if HNF-6 binds to the Oc3 gene, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. The chromatin from Flag/HNF-6-transfected BMEL cells was immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody and the immunoprecipitated fraction was tested by PCR for the presence of Oc3 gene regions containing the HNF-6 binding sites. As shown in Fig. 3C, the three regions were amplified from chromatin that had been immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. No amplification was observed with an unrelated antibody. Altogether, these results indicate that HNF-6 binds to a conserved region of the Oc3 gene in native chromatin and stimulates transcription of this gene. HNF-6 Induces Oc3 Gene Expression in the Developing Endoderm—We then designed experiments to confirm that HNF-6 can stimulate Oc3 gene transcription in the mouse endoderm. We recently developed a system that allows delivery of DNA to discrete regions of the mouse endoderm in situ such as the prepancreatic or prehepatic territories.2 Electroporation of precisely oriented 6- to 8-somite embryos is followed by a 24-h culture of the whole embryos such that they reach the 18–22-somite stage (Fig. 4A). Morphogenic events occur as they do in vivo during that period and the sheet of cells that forms the endoderm gives rise to the primitive gut. Using this technique we delivered a HNF-6 expression vector in the foregut-midgut region of the endoderm of e8.5 embryos, together with a GFP expression vector to assess electroporation efficiency. Nonelectroporated embryos were cultured in parallel as controls. After the 24-h culture, the region of the primitive gut corresponding to the targeted region was dissected out and total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed. Fig. 4B shows that the electroporated embryos expressed Gfp and that Hnf6 was expressed in the endoderm electroporated with the HNF-6 expression vector. Expression levels of the endogenous Onecut genes in the endoderm of these embryos were measured by real time PCR. Endogenous Hnf6 mRNA was detected by using an antisense primer in the 3′-untranslated region of Hnf6, which is not present in the HNF-6 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 4C, the levels of Onecut factor mRNAs were not influenced by the electroporation per se. Expression of exogenous HNF-6 had no effect on Hnf6 or Oc2 expression. In contrast, it increased dramatically Oc3 expression in the endoderm. To demonstrate that Oc3 is induced in the cells transfected with HNF-6, we cultured embryos for 24 h after electroporation with the HNF-6 expression vector and performed immunofluorescence on sections costained for HNF-6 and E-cadherin to localize the endodermal epithelium (Fig. 5A). A cluster of cells in the gut endoderm reacted with the anti-HNF-6 antibody. Note that this HNF-6 staining is so strong that the endogenous HNF-6, albeit present, is barely visible. The electroporated cells were localized in the prehepatic region as revealed by the Prox1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5B). The adjacent section, stained with anti-OC-3 and anti-Pdx-1 antibodies, revealed strong expression of OC-3 in the cluster of HNF-6 positive cells opposite the Pdx-1 territory (Fig. 5C), supporting the idea that HNF-6 directly induces OC-3 expression. We conclude that HNF6 cell-autonomously stimulates OC3 expression in the endoderm. We next addressed the question as to whether HNF-6 can induce Oc3 expression in cells that are not fated to normally express OC-3. By orientating the embryo between the electrodes so that DNA is delivered in the anterior part of the foregut pocket, we targeted the esophageal region (boxed in Fig. 5D), as demonstrated by the expression of HNF-6 in some cells of this region (Fig. 5E). We observed cells that were positive for OC-3 in this electroporated esophageal region (Fig. 5F), indicating that HNF-6 is able to turn on the transcription of the Oc3 gene ectopically. Development of the liver and pancreas from the endoderm involves the hepatic or pancreatic commitment of endodermal precursors, followed by differentiation of these precursors into the corresponding tissue-specific cell types. These processes depend on a network of transcription factors, whose onset of expression and mutual control is far from being completely elucidated. Our earlier work has demonstrated that HNF-6 is an important member of this network, by showing that inactivation of the Hnf6 gene perturbs liver and pancreas development and by identifying transcription factors as HNF-6 target genes. Thus, in the mouse embryo, HNF-6 stimulates Hnf1β expression in liver, thereby controlling intrahepatic bile duct morphogenesis (16Clotman F. Lannoy V.J. Reber M. Cereghini S. Cassiman D. Jacquemin P. Roskams T. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Development. 2002; 129: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the pancreas HNF-6 stimulates expression of Hnf1β (24Maestro M.A. Boj S.J. Luco R.F. Pierreux C.E. Cabedo J. Servitja J.M. German M.S. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Ferrer J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 12: 3307-3314Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Ngn3 (15Jacquemin P. Durviaux S.M. Jensen J. Godfraind C. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Madsen O.D. Carmeliet P. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4445-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), thereby controlling endocrine differentiation. HNF-6 also plays a role at an earlier stage in the endoderm where it is involved in the onset of Pdx1 expression (14Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this paper, we identify a second transcription factor as an HNF-6 target in developing endoderm, namely its paralog OC-3. Indeed, we show here that HNF-6 can bind to the Oc3 gene in native chromatin and that it can stimulate Oc3 expression not only in transfected cells, but also in the endoderm in situ. Moreover, this regulatory cascade is developmentally relevant, as inactivation of the Hnf6 gene leads to a down-regulation of OC-3 both in the endoderm and in the endoderm-derived organs that express HNF-6, namely the liver and pancreas. It is noteworthy that induction of Oc3 expression by HNF-6 is limited in time and space. At e9, expression of OC3 in the endoderm is detected only in a subpopulation of HNF-6-expressing cells, whereas at e10.5 OC-3 expression extends to almost all the HNF-6 territory, which corresponds to the liver, pancreas, and part of the stomach and gut. Later on, HNF-6 becomes restricted to the liver and the pancreas, whereas OC-3 disappears from these tissues but remains expressed in the stomach and in the intestine (10Vanhorenbeeck V. Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Landry C. Clotman F. Hioki T. Oda H. Picard J.J Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G.

Biol. 1997; 192: 228-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The induction of Oc3 by HNF-6 may require time and space-restricted cooperation of HNF-6 with other Oc3 regulatory factors and/or posttranslational regulation of HNF-6 activity (25Streeper R.S. Hornbuckle L.A. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Oeser J.K. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19111-19118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We also show here that all three Onecut factors are expressed in a region of the endoderm that will eventually form the stomach, duodenum, liver, and pancreas. Interestingly, they are expressed in the sequential order Hnf6, Oc2, Oc3, so that Onecut factor expression defines three successive steps in endoderm maturation (Fig. 6A). This is relevant for understanding pancreas and liver development and for implementing this information in the context of cell therapy. Indeed, transcription factors alone or in combination are used to promote controlled cell differentiation and are useful markers to determine the precise differentiation stages of cells that are cultured in well defined conditions. Our gene expression analysis of Hnf6 knock-out embryos extends our knowledge of the transcription factor network in the endoderm (Fig. 6B). First, OC-2 induction is independent from HNF-6 because we show here that OC-2 is expressed in the Hnf6 knock-out embryos and that electroporation of HNF-6 in cultured cells or in the endoderm does not induce Oc2. Second, our data would rule out that it is OC-2 that triggers Oc3 gene transcription in the endoderm. Indeed, in the Hnf6 knock-out, OC-3 is not expressed despite the normal expression of OC-2. Moreover, ectopic expression of HNF-6 in the esophagus induced Oc3 expression, in the absence of OC-2. Another implication of the present work bears on the interpretation of the endodermal phenotype of Hnf6 knock-out embryos. Pdx-1 expression in their endoderm is retarded from the 8–12-somite stage until the 19–22-somite stage (14Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), i.e. Pdx-1 appears at the time when OC-3 becomes significantly expressed in the normal embryo. This could have suggested that it is OC-3 that triggers Pdx-1 expression in the absence of HNF-6. Our data show that this is unlikely, as in the Hnf6 knock-out Pdx-1 eventually appears despite the absence of OC-3. The question of the possible role of OC-2 in inducing Pdx-1 in the Hnf6 knock-out embryos remains open, because OC-2 levels are unaffected in these knock-out embryos. On the other hand, the fact that OC-3 is down-regulated in the Hnf6 knock-out embryos may account for some developmental defects of these embryos. These defects might result from failed expression of genes that are targeted specifically by OC-3 alone or by both HNF-6 and OC-3. Because, in normal embryos, OC-3 is first detected on the ventral side (prehepatic and prepancreatic territories) of the endoderm, one would expect that the consequences of this combined HNF-6/OC-3 deficiency appear first in the ventral prepancreatic and/or prehepatic endoderm. This is indeed the case. In Hnf6 knock-out embryos, development is more severely affected on the ventral side than on the dorsal side, with an absence of gallbladder, a longer delay in the expression of Pdx-1, and an extremely reduced ventral pancreatic bud (14Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Clotman F. Lannoy V.J. Reber M. Cereghini S. Cassiman D. Jacquemin P. Roskams T. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Development. 2002; 129: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier experiments with cultured cells and on Hnf6 knock-out embryos have shown that HNF-6 can bind to and stimulate several genes coding for transcription factors. Thus, HNF-6 participates to the networks of transcription factors that regulate development of the endoderm and endoderm-derived organs. These factors include HNF-3β, HNF-4, HNF-1β, Pdx-1, and Ngn3. The present work extends our knowledge of the control exerted on these factors, not only by HNF-6, but also by the other Onecut proteins (Fig. 6B). In the endoderm, HNF-6 is required for normal expression of Pdx1 (14Jacquemin P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), Oc3 (this paper), and Hnf1β, 3C. E. Pierreux, F. P. Lemaigre, and G. G.

In the liver, HNF-6 is critical for expression of Oc3 (this paper) and Hnf1β, and this HNF-6 → Hnf1β cascade controls bile duct development (16Clotman F. Lannoy V.J. Reber M. Cereghini S. Cassiman D.

Whereas independent inactivation of Hnf6 or Oc2 does not affect Hnf4 expression in liver, the combined inactivation of Hnf6 and Oc2 strongly reduces expression of the α7 isoform of HNF-4 (26Briançon N.

Although no OC-3 target genes have been identified to date, this factor may be involved in the differentiation of the endoderm and endoderm-derived tissues, downstream of HNF-6. In conclusion, the data presented here broaden our understanding of the network of transcription factors that are expressed in the endoderm. They define stages in the embryonic expression pattern of the Onecut transcription factors. They identify OC-3 as a new target of HNF-6 in the endoderm as well as in developing pancreas and liver, pointing to a new mechanism by which HNF-6 can control developmental events.

https://openalex.org/W2043691312,"Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP) plays a key role in tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix and activating proMMP2. Here we show that the conserved hemopexin domain is required for MT1-MMP-mediated invasion and growth in three-dimensional type I collagen matrix but not proMMP2 activation. Deletion of the hemopexin domains in MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, MT5-, and MT6-MMP does not impair their abilities to activate proMMP2. In fact, hemopexin-less MT5- and MT6-MMP activate proMMP2 better than their wild type counterparts. On the other hand, hemopexin-less MT1-MMP fails to promote cell invasion into type I collagen but retains the capacity to enhance the growth of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as cysts in three-dimensional collagen matrix. Moreover, the hemopexin domain is also required for MT1-MMP-mediated invasion/scattering of MCF-7 cells in three-dimensional collagen matrix. Because growth and invasion in a three-dimensional model may correlate with tumor invasiveness <i>in vivo</i>, our data suggest that the hemopexin domains of MT-MMPs should be targeted for the development of anti-cancer therapies by employing screening assays developed for three-dimensional models rather than their enzymatic activity toward proMMP2."
https://openalex.org/W2131555683,"Helicobacter pylori produces a potent exotoxin, VacA, which causes progressive vacuolation as well as gastric injury. Although VacA was able to interact with two receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases, RPTPβ and RPTPα, RPTPβ was found to be responsible for gastric damage caused by VacA. To define the region of RPTPβ involved in VacA binding, we made mutants of human cDNA RPTPβ-B, a short receptor form of RPTPβ. Immunoprecipitation experiments to assess VacA binding to RPTPβ-B mutants indicated that five residues (QTTQP) at positions 747–751 of the extracellular domain of RPTPβ-B (which is commonly retained in RPTPβ-A, a long form of RPTPβ) play a crucial role in its interaction with VacA, resulting in vacuolation as well as Git-1 phosphorylation. Transfected cells expressing deletion mutant Δ752, which lacks QTTQP, or the double point mutant Δ747 (T748A,T749A) had diminished vacuolation in response to VacA. Treatment of RPTPβ-B and Δ747 (which have QTTQP at 747–751) with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase diminished their VacA binding, whereas chondroitinase ABC did not have an effect. No inhibitory effect of pleiotrophin, a natural RPTPβ ligand, on VacA binding to RPTPβ-B or Δ747 was observed, supporting the conclusion that the extracellular region of RPTPβ-B responsible for VacA binding is different from that involved in binding pleiotrophin. These data define the region in the RPTPβ extracellular domain critical for VacA binding, in particular the sequence QTTQP at positions 747–751 with crucial threonines at positions 748 and 749 and are consistent with a role for terminal sialic acids possibly because of threonine glycosylation.

This resulting pBK-CMV-B-WT-RPTPβ cDNA encoded a sequence identical to that of RPTPβ-B as determined by Levy et al. (34Levy J.B. Canoll P.D. Silvennoinen O. Barnea G. Morse B. Honegger A.M. Huang J.T. Cannizzaro L.A. Park S.H. Druck T. Huebner K. Sap J. Ehrlich M. Musacchio J.M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10573-10581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we could not succeed in expressing RPTPβ-B in transfected cells using pBK-CMV-B-WT-RPTPβ. Therefore we prepared HA-tagged pEF-BOS-RPTPβ-B; primers used for the RPTPβ signal peptide region were RPTPβ-B1s (GCTAGC was added to the primer to create an NheI site) and RPTPβ-B1a (GGCTGCAG was added to the primer to create a PstI site) (see Table I). The PCR products were first subcloned into the NheI and PstI sites of the pBK-CMV vector. Next, HA oligonucleotides HA-s (sense) and HA-a (antisense) (TCGAC and CTGCA were added to the primer to create a site for SalI and PstI) were annealed and inserted into multicloning sites of PstI and SalI on the pBK-CMV vector, which contained a sequence encoding a signal peptide region; these constructs were then digested with NheI and KpnI. These fragments were treated with Klenow and then ligated into the pEF-BOS vector using XbaI sites. RPTPβ-B was amplified using pBK-CMV-B-WT-RPTPβ cDNA as a template and primers, RPTPβ-B2s (ACTAGT was added to the primer to create an SpeI site), and RPTPβ-rev, and the resulting cDNA was subcloned into a pBlueScript vector, which was then digested with SpeI and ClaI. These fragments were inserted into SpeI and ClaI sites of the pEF-BOS vector, into which the signal peptide region and HA tag had already been inserted, and the resulting construct was digested with ClaI and SmaI. The digested fragment of pBK-CMV-B-WT-RPTPβ with ClaI and SmaI sites was ligated into the ClaI and SmaI site of the pEF-BOS vector. This construct is hereafter referred to as pEF-BOS-HA-B-WT. The primers listed on Table I were used to construct various deletion and point mutants of HA-B-WT. These PCR products were first subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which was then digested with SpeI and ClaI. These fragments were cloned into the SpeI and ClaI sites of the pEF-BOS-HA-B-WT vector.Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Blotting—Cells were washed once with cold PBS and harvested in TNE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 2 min. Cells were suspended and lysed in 500 μl of T-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation (17,000 × g,20 min) to remove insoluble material, the supernatants (60 μg, 250 μl) were incubated with 30 nm heat-inactivated VacA or VacA for 1 h and then incubated overnight with anti-VacA IgG. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (25 μl of 50% bead suspension solution per sample) (Amersham Biosciences) were added, followed by incubation for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with T-lysis buffer and boiled in SDS-sample buffer before separation of precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, reacted with specific antibodies using standard procedures, and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). To immunoprecipitate wild-type or deletion mutants of RPTPβ containing an HA tag, which were expressed in the COS-7 cells, anti-HA antibody (instead of anti-VacA antibody) was added to the supernatants of cell lysates. An anti-human RPTPβ mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), which had been prepared by immunization with the 2098–2307 region of human RPTPβ, was used for detection of RPTPβ-A and RPTPβ-B expressed in AZ-521 cell after immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis.Git1 Phosphorylation—BHK-21 cells (2 × 105), which lack RPTPβ but contain its substrate Git1, were cultured on Matrigel-coated plates for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FCS and then transfected with RPTPβ mutant expression plasmids (9Fujikawa A. Shirasaka D. Yamamoto S. Ota H. Yahiro K. Fukuda M. Shintani T. Wada A. Aoyama N. Hirayama T. Fukamachi H. Noda M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). After cultivation for 24 h, cells were incubated with or without VacA for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS; this was followed by treatment with N-lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min), 1 μl of anti-Git1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and 25 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the supernatants (320 μg, 400 μl); this was followed by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with N-lysis buffer and boiled in SDS-sample buffer before separation of precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody-HRP (1: 1000, Amersham Biosciences) or anti-Git1 monoclonal antibody (1: 2000, Transduction Laboratories) and visualized using ECL. Densitometric analysis was performed to compare the intensities of the visualized bands.Neuraminidase and O-Glycosidase Treatments—After transfection of wild-type RPTPβ or its deletion mutant cDNA constructs into COS-7 cells and growth for 24 h, the cells (3 × 105) were lysed with T-lysis buffer, which was followed by centrifugation (20 min, 17,000 × g). Samples (6 μg) of supernatant (20 μl) were added to a mixture of 24 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μl of neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science, 10 milliunits/μl) or O-glycosidase (Roche Applies Science, 0.5 or 1 milliunits/μl); this was followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 or 24 h for neuraminidase or O-glycosidase treatment, respectively. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-VacA antibody after addition of VacA or a heat-inactivated VacA. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for analysis.RESULTSMapping of Responsible Region of RPTPβ-B to Bind VacA— Four isoforms of RPTPβ are known; RPTPβ-A is the long receptor form, RPTPβ-B is the short form lacking a serine glycine-rich region in the extracellular domain, and two soluble forms, phosphacan and phosphacan short form, lack transmembrane and intracellular domains (36Garwood J. Heck N. Reichardt F. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24164-24173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Among four isoforms, RPTPβ-A and RPTPβ-B, which contain intracellular domains (Fig. 1A), may function in signal transduction events involved in VacA toxicity. Levels of RPTPβ-A and RPTPβ-B mRNA in AZ-521 cells were determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using primers RPTPβ-Afwd, RPTPβ-Bfwd, and RPTPβ-rev, respectively (Table I). Gastric cell line AZ-521 expressed both RPTPβ-A and RPTPβ-B at the mRNA (Fig. 1B) or protein (Fig. 1C) level. To determine the region of RPTPβ that is required for VacA binding, we used RPTPβ-B cDNA to prepare several mutant expression constructs (nine deletion mutants and three mutants with amino acid substitutions) with a HA-tag sequence in a pEF-BOS vector (Fig. 2A). VacA interaction with HA-tagged RPTPβ-B mutants, which were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, was tested by immunoprecipitation using anti-VacA antibody. Among nine deletion mutants tested, VacA interacted with all except Δ752 (Fig. 2B). The difference between these eight deletion mutants and Δ752 in VacA binding was not caused by differences in amounts of mutant proteins, which were not significantly different in the nine populations of transfected cells, as assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation of RPTPβ-B (B-WT) and its mutants transiently expressed in COS-7 cells.

B, lysates of cells transfected with B-WT or its mutant constructs were mixed with heat-inactivated (IA) or untreated 30 nm VacA (A) and immunoprecipitated with anti-VacA IgG. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDFmembranes, and detected with anti-RPTPβ antibody. C, proteins immunoprecipitated from lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with vector, B-WT, or its mutant constructs with anti-HA antibodies were separated, and blots were reacted with anti-RPTPβ antibodies.

Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is strongly associated with many cancer types and is up-regulated in the aggressive, metastatic neoplasms. During the past few years, there has been an increasing appreciation of the important, albeit incompletely understood, role of MT1-MMP in cancer. We have discovered, using cell-free and cell-based assays in vitro, that MT1-MMP proteolysis specifically targets C3b, an essential component of the complement propagation pathway. MT1-MMP proteolysis liberates the deposited C3 activation fragments from the cell surface. The shedding of these cell-deposited opsonins by MT1-MMP inhibits the complement cascade and protects breast carcinoma MCF7 cells from direct complement-mediated injury in the in vitro tests. The functional link associating MT1-MMP with the host immune system, heretofore unrecognized, may empower tumors with an escape mechanism that contributes to the protection against the host anti-tumor immunity as well as to the survival of invading and metastatic malignant cells in the bloodstream.

The functional link associating MT1-MMP with the host immune system, heretofore unrecognized, may empower tumors with an escape mechanism that contributes to the protection against the host anti-tumor immunity as well as to the survival of invading and metastatic malignant cells in the bloodstream. It is well established that the progression of metastatic cancer involves the interplay of the host environment with the malignant cells (1Bissell M.J. Radisky D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Neoplasms employ multiple means to sustain themselves and to proliferate in vivo. Evidence has emerged that tumor immunity is an important defense mechanism protecting malignant cells from the host immune surveillance. The host immune system is an apparatus directed against foreign invading organisms and tumor cells (2Morgan B.P. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 173-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Morgan B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 150: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar, 4Liszewski M.K. Farries T.C. Lublin D.M. Rooney I.A. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 201-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Controlled activation of the complement system is a critical component of host immunity. Complement activation products stimulate a localized protective inflammation and are involved in both the inductive and effector phases of an immune response (5Jurianz K. Ziegler S. Garcia-Schuler H. Kraus S. Bohana-Kashtan O. Fishelson Z. Kirschfink M. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In many cases malignant cells exhibit antigens that are not typically associated with normal cells. These antigens can be identified by the complement system via antibody recognition and, as a result, the recognized cells are attacked by the immune system (6Dachs G.U. Dougherty G.J. Stratford I.J. Chaplin D.J. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 313-325PubMed Google Scholar). The complement system is comprised of soluble proteins that interact in a stepwise manner. Complement can be activated via three different pathways: the classical pathway that is usually antibody-dependent, and the alternative and lectin pathways. In the classical pathway, immunoglobulin-coated targets bind and subsequently activate the complement component C1. This event starts the complement cascade, the propagation of which results in the generation of anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, and C5a) and ultimately the cytolytic C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC) 1The abbreviations used are: MAC, membrane attack complex; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MMP-2, matrix metalloproteinase-2; MT1-MMP, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. (7Rus H.G. Niculescu F.I. Shin M.L. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the process of complement propagation, proteolytic cleavage of serum C3 and C4 creates transient soluble C3b and C4b products with an exposed reactive thioester group. Once exposed, the thioester group forms amide and ester bonds with the target cell surface molecules. This binding of C3b and C4b is critical for amplification of the cascade and for MAC formation. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage transforms the cell-bound C3b into the cleavage fragments iC3b, C3dg, and C3d, which remain covalently attached to the cell surface. These C3 fragments serve as ligands for receptors on phagocytic and NK cells. Opsonization of target cells with these C3 fragments promotes and enhances both antibody-dependent and complement-dependent cell cytotoxicity, two additional effector systems that play an important role in the elimination of neoplastic cells (8Delibrias C. Fischer E. Kazachtkine M. Rother K. Till G.O. Haensch G.M. The Complement System. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1997: 211-220Google Scholar, 9Cole D.S. Morgan B.P. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2003; 104: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The deposition of C3b and C4b and the follow-up amplification of the complement cascade also results in the generation of soluble bioactive C3a and C5a peptides that may potentiate anti-tumor responses via their chemoattractant and proinflammatory activities. Thus, the inactivation of C3b and C4b and their removal from a cell surface represents an important immune evasion mechanism of tumor cells. An important role for complement resistance of tumor cells is indicated by the fact that many tumor cells overexpress one or more of the cell surface-associated complement regulatory proteins: CD46/MCP, CD55/DAF, and CD59/protectin. These regulatory proteins act at different stages of the complement propagation (10Caragine T.A. Okada N. Frey A.B. Tomlinson S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1110-1115PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gorter A.

In addition to the cell-associated regulatory proteins, some tumor cells bind serum complement inhibitory proteins (14Fedarko N.S. Jain A. Karadag A. Van Eman M.R. Fisher L.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4060-4066PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fedarko N.S. Fohr B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. J. Biol.

Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is the most common protease from the membrane-tethered enzyme subfamily of MMPs (19Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP plays an important, albeit insufficiently characterized, role in tissue remodeling and cell motility, and especially in tumor progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis (20Hotary K.B.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is a cell surface activator of soluble pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-13 and has also been implicated in matrix proteolysis and turnover as well as in the proteolytic processing of cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors (19Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar, 22Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. Acta Pathol. Microbiol.

Although MT1-MMP is detectable in normal tissue, the expression of this protease is strongly associated with aggressive, invasive malignant cells (19Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar, 24Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

Here, we report a novel, unexpected and highly significant function of MT1-MMP in the proteolysis of the opsonic complement components C3b and C4b. This proteolysis efficiently inhibits complement activation in cell-based models. We suspect that MT1-MMP is likely to make malignant cells more resistant to complement-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo. Our data indicate that this novel function of MT1-MMP is involved in the release of C3b from the tumor cell surface, and is likely to contribute to the survival and propagation of malignant cells. We believe that the proteolysis of the complement components by MT1-MMP is a powerful and efficient mechanism employed by aggressive malignant cells to protect themselves against host complement, immune surveillance, and destruction.

Rabbit antiserum against the breast carcinoma MCF7 cell membranes was prepared by routine techniques and, where indicated, was used to sensitize MCF7 cells to human complement. Rabbit antibody against the recombinant catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was generated in our laboratory. Cell Lines—Human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells (ATCC) stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3-zeo vector (Invitrogen) (control MCF-zeo cells) and the full-length wild type MT1-MMP (MCF-MT cells) were constructed and extensively characterized in our prior work (28Rozanov D.V.

Human breast carcinoma BT549, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, T47D, and SK-Br-3 cells (ATCC) were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml). MMP-2 Activation by MT1-MMP and Gelatin Zymography—TIMP-2-free pro-MMP-2 was isolated from a conditioned medium of p2AHT2A72 cells derived from an HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line sequentially transfected with the E1A and MMP-2 cDNAs (29Strongin A.Y.

MCF7-zeo and -MT cells (1 × 105 cells each) were incubated for 12 h in DMEM supplemented with pro-MMP-2 (20 ng/200 μl of medium). HT1080 cells (1 × 105 cells) were incubated 12 h in DMEM (200 μl) alone. Where indicated PMA (5 ng/ml) was added to the cells. Aliquots (10 μl) of medium conditioned by the cells were analyzed by gelatin zymography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HT1080, MCF-zeo, and MCF-MT cells were grown in DMEM/FCS. Where indicated, PMA (5 ng/ml) was added to the cells. After incubation for 12 h, cells were washed with PBS and surface biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 50 mmN-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Amresco) in PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. The lysates were pre-cleared with Protein G-agarose beads (Calbiochem). The samples of cell lysates each containing 1.0 mg of protein were mixed with an MT1-MMP antibody (1 μg) and Protein G-agarose, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washings, immune complexes were released by boiling the beads for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Solubilized proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (28Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

MT1-MMP Proteolysis of C3b and C4b in Vitro—Purified human C3b and C4b (200 ng each) were co-incubated with MT1-CAT (0.2–20 ng) at 37 °C in 15 μl of 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 0.01% Brij-35, pH 6.8.

MT1-MMP Proteolysis of the Cell Surface-bound C3b and C4b in MCF7 Cells—MCF-zeo and -MT cells (105 cells per well) were each grown for 48 h in DMEM/FBS in wells of a 48-well plate. The cells were then sensitized by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 20% rabbit anti-MCF7 heat-inactivated serum (56 °C, 30 min). The cell samples, in which sensitization with anti-MCF7 serum was omitted, were used as controls. Sensitized cells were additionally incubated for 5–60 min at 37 °C in 10 or 20% C5-depleted human serum to induce the deposition of the C3b and C4b onto the cell surface. Following extensive washing, cells were subjected for flow cytometry or additionally incubated at 37 °C for 2–12 h in DMEM/FBS (heat-inactivated) to induce the proteolytic shedding and the release of the cell-bound C3b and C4b into the extracellular milieu. Where indicated, GM6001 (50 μm) was added to DMEM/FBS (heat-inactivated) to block cellular MT1-MMP. The residual levels of cell surface-associated C3b and C4b were measured by Western blotting and flow cytometry. For flow cytometry analyses the cells were detached by an enzyme-free buffer (Specialty Media), washed, and stained for 1 h at 4 °C with the murine monoclonal antibody H206 against human C3b α chain (5 μg/ml) followed by incubation for 30 min with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. All incubation steps were performed in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.01% NaN3. After removal of unbound antibodies, cells were re-suspended in PBS supplemented with 3 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), 1% BSA, and 0.01% NaN3. Viable cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Where indicated, GM6001 (50 μm) was co-incubated with the cells for 24 h. For Western blotting cells were lysed for 1 h at 0 °C in 100 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Aliquots (20 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% gels and Western blotting with goat anti-human C3 and C4 antibodies (1 μg/ml each in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20), HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution), and the TMB/M substrate. C3b liberated from the cell surface by proteolytic shedding and released into the extracellular milieu was identified by ELISA of the medium samples. For these purposes, MCF-zeo and -MT cells (105 cells each) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °Cin DMEM supplemented with 20% C5-depleted human serum to induce deposition of C3b on cell surfaces. Next, unbound material was removed by washing cells with PBS. A mixture of DMEM/FBS (200 μl) was added to the cells. Following incubation for 30–120 min to release the cell-bound C3b, the aliquots of medium were withdrawn for a subsequent analysis of the liberated C3b. Where indicated, GM6001 (50 μm) was co-incubated with the cells to block activity of the cellular MT1-MMP. ELISA of Soluble C3b—Wells of a 96-well plate (Corning) were coated with goat anti-human C3 antibody (5 μg/ml) and then blocked with 1% BSA. Medium aliquots (100 μl) were allowed to bind for 1 h at 37 °C with the antibody-coated wells. The bound C3b was detected with biotin-labeled goat anti-human C3 (1 μg/ml) followed by streptavidin-HRP and the TMB/E substrate. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm. Flow Cytometry of the Complement Regulatory Proteins—Flow cytometry was used to assess the cell surface expression of complement regulatory proteins CD46, CD55, and CD59 in MCF-zeo and -MT cells. For these purposes, cells were detached by the enzyme-free buffer (Specialty Media) and co-incubated with the respective primary antibody (5 μg/ml each) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (1:500 dilution). Population gates were set by using cells incubated with normal murine IgG. Cells were analyzed on a FACStar flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cytotoxicity Assay—MCF-zeo and -MT cells (1 × 105 each) were grown in DMEM/FBS in wells of a 48-well plate. To sensitize cells, 20% heat-inactivated rabbit MCF7 antiserum was co-incubated with the cells for 30 min at 37 °C. The sensitized cells were then placed for 1 h at 37 °C in 20% normal human serum to induce the activation of the complement pathway and lysis of the cells by the resulting membrane attack complex. The treatment with rabbit anti-MCF7 serum was omitted in control samples. The efficiency of the cell lysis was determined by using a Vybrant Cytotoxicity Assay Kit V-23111 (Molecular Probes) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The cytotoxic effect of the complement was also assessed by microscopy. For this purpose, MCF-zeo and -MT cells (1 × 105 cells each) were grown in DMEM/FBS in wells of an 8-well Lab-Tek™ chamber glass slide (Nalge Nunc). Heat-inactivated 20% rabbit anti-MCF7 serum was co-incubated with the cells for 30 min at 37 °C. The sensitized cells were further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 20% normal human serum and then fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at ambient temperature and photographed. Dead cells were made visible with propidium iodide using a LIVE/DEAD Reduced Biohazard Viability/Cytotoxicity L-7013 Kit (Molecular Probes) and the images were taken by a Nikon Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscope equipped with a SPOT Real-Time SP402–115 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Purification and Iodination of TIMP-2—Human TIMP-2 was produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the C-terminal His-tagged human TIMP-2. TIMP-2 was purified from conditioned medium by chelating chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography using the slightly modified protocol described in Ref. 30DeClerck Y.A. Yean T.D. Lu H.S. Ting J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3893-3899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. TIMP-2 (10 μg) was labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) using the IODO-GEN iodination reagent (Pierce) and separated from unincorporated radioactivity by gel-filtration. Normally, the specific radioactivity of labeled TIMP-2 was 4–5 μCi/μg. Cell Surface Binding of Radiolabeled TIMP-2—To remove cell-bound endogenous TIMP-2, cells (1.5 × 105 cells per well of a 12-well plate) were washed prior to assays with 50 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, then neutralized with 0.5 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and, finally, equilibrated with DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2% BSA. Increasing concentrations of 125I-TIMP-2 (0.03–14 nm) were added to the cells. Following a 3-h incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed twice with ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2% BSA, and lysed in 0.5 m NaOH containing 0.1% SDS; the radioactivity was then counted. The nonspecific background binding was determined using a 200-fold excess of unlabeled over highest concentration of 125I ligand. One well of each cluster was used to count the number of cells. Each experimental point was measured in duplicate. GraphPad Prism software was used to calculate the Scatchard plot and the Kd value. Isolation of RNA and Northern Blotting Analysis—The total RNA was isolated from the cells with a RNAzol B reagent (Tel-Tech). RNA (15 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with the 32P-labeled MT1-MMP cDNA and with the 32P-labeled 28 S rRNA oligonucleotide probe (Clontech). Transfected Breast Carcinoma Cells Express Physiologically Relevant Levels of MT1-MMP—We selected breast carcinoma MCF7 cells for our studies because the parental cells are deficient in MT1-MMP and MMP-2 (28Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here, we used MCF7 cells transfected with the wild type MT1-MMP cDNA (MCF-MT cells) as well as control cells transfected with the original pcDNA3-zeo plasmid (MCF-zeo cells). To exclude possible artifacts caused by MT1-MMP overexpression and to demonstrate that the transfected cells exhibit physiologically relevant, rather than aberrantly high levels of MT1-MMP, we compared MT1-MMP protease activity in MCF-MT and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. HT1080 cells produce MT1-MMP and MMP-2 naturally. The efficiency of the MT1-MMP-mediated activation of MMP-2 and the rate of conversion of the 68-kDa proenzyme into the 64-kDa intermediate and then into the active, mature 62-kDa enzyme were used as measures of the cell surface-associated MT1-MMP activity. Gelatin zymography was employed to visualize the levels of MMP-2 activation. MCF7 cells were supplemented in these assays with external pro-MMP-2 in amounts that were similar to those naturally synthesized by HT1080 cells. To promote the activation of MMP-2, HT1080 cells were stimulated with PMA (5 ng/ml) (31Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Hernandez-Barrantes S. Bernardo M. Toth M. Fridman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the efficiency of MMP-2 activation by the transfected MCF-MT cells is highly similar to that of HT1080 cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting similar levels of cell surface-associated mature MT1-MMP in these two cell types. To confirm these observations, we directly identified the levels of cell surface-associated MT1-MMP in MCF-MT and HT1080 cells. For these purposes, cells were surface-labeled with membrane-impermeable biotin and then analyzed. Biotin-labeled, cell surface-associated MT1-MMP was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and detected by Western blotting with streptavidin-HRP (Fig. 1B). These studies demonstrated that cell surface-associated, full-length 60-kDa MT1-MMP was equally represented in HT1080 and MCF-MT cells. In addition, MCF-MT cells exhibit significant amounts of the 43–45-kDa catalytically inactive ectodomain forms of the protease. PMA treatment increased the levels of the degraded MT1-MMP in HT1080 cells. The existence of these full-length and degraded species of MT1-MMP is in agreement with our earlier findings (28Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the results published by others (32Hernandez-Barrantes S. Bernardo M. Toth M. Fridman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Importantly, these data, which agree well with those of the MMP-2 activation studies, indicate similar levels of the full-length, catalytically potent MT1-MMP in HT1080 and MCF-MT cells. To extend these comparison studies further, we compared by Northern blotting the levels of the MT1-MMP mRNA in fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells with those in breast carcinoma BT549, MDA-MD-231, and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1C). In agreement with the data of Western blotting that did not detect the expression of the MT1-MMP protein in MCF7-zeo cells (Fig. 1B), Northern blotting did not identify any detectable amounts of the MT1-MMP mRNA in this cell type. In turn, the levels of the MT1-MMP mRNA were relatively low in MDA-MD-231 cells but significantly higher in BT549 cells and comparable with the levels of the messenger identified in HT1080 cells. To substantiate these observations even further, we identified the number of the TIMP-2-binding MT1-MMP cell surface sites in HT1080 and BT549 cells. For these purposes, we incubated the cells with increasing concentrations of radioactively labeled TIMP-2. An excess of unlabeled TIMP-2 fully blocked the binding of the labeled inhibitor with the cells. TIMP-1 (a poor inhibitor of MT1-MMP) was incapable of interfering with the labeled TIMP-2 ligand (data not shown). Following incubation with labeled TIMP-2 and washing to remove the unbound radioactivity, cells were lysed and the radioactivity was counted in cell lysates. Scatchard plot analysis of binding data demonstrated the existence of high affinity binding sites with KD = 3.9 nm and 235,000 sites per HT1080 cell (Fig. 1D). Similarly, BT549 cells exhibited 136,000 MT1-MMP sites/cell and KD = 1.34 nm. These data correlate well with the concentrations of the MT1-MMP mRNA identified by Northern blotting in HT1080 and BT549 cells (Fig. 1C). The data from literature also are in agreement with our results (33Nuttall R.K. Pennington C.J. Taplin J. Wheal A. Yong V.W. Forsyth P.A. Edwards D.R. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 333-345PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E. Bahou W.F. Docherty A.J. Cao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1216-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, real-time PCR studies identified that the levels of MT1-MMP expression in HT1080 cells are highly similar to those found in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, prostate carcinoma PC3, breast carcinoma BT549, and melanoma G361 cells (33Nuttall R.K. Pennington C.J. Taplin J. Wheal A. Yong V.W. Forsyth P.A. Edwards D.R. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 333-345PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude from these findings and the data available from the literature that the levels of MT1-MMP in the MT1-MMP-transfected breast carcinoma MCF7 cell model are comparable with those existing naturally in fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells as well as in numerous other cell types including breast carcinoma BT549 cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and melanoma G361 cells. Therefore, the effects of MT1-MM"
https://openalex.org/W1989195022,"When the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is integrated into the genome of a mammalian cell, its long terminal repeat (LTR) harbors six specifically positioned nucleosomes. Transcription from the MMTV promoter is regulated by the glucocorticoid hormone via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The mechanism of the apparently constitutive nucleosome arrangement has remained unclear. Previous in vitro reconstitution of nucleosome(s) on small segments of the MMTV LTR suggested that the DNA sequence was decisive for the nucleosome arrangement. However, microinjection of MMTV LTR DNA in Xenopus oocytes rendered randomly distributed nucleosomes. This indicated that oocytes lack factor(s) that induces nucleosome positioning at the MMTV LTR in other cells. Here we demonstrate that specific and concomitant binding of nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and octamer factor 1 (Oct1) to their cognate sites within the MMTV promoter induce a partial nucleosome positioning that is an intermediary state between the randomly organized inactive promoter and the hormone and GR-activated promoter containing distinctly positioned nucleosomes. Oct1 and NF1 reciprocally facilitate each other's binding to the MMTV LTR in vivo. The NF1 and Oct1 binding also facilitate hormone-dependent GR-DNA interaction and result in a faster and stronger hormone response. Since NF1 and Oct1 generate an intermediary state of nucleosome positioning and enhance the hormone-induced response, we refer to this as a preset chromatin structure. We propose that this state of NF1 and Oct1-induced chromatin presetting mimics the early step(s) of chromatin remodeling involved in tissue-specific gene expression.

We propose that this state of NF1 and Oct1-induced chromatin presetting mimics the early step(s) of chromatin remodeling involved in tissue-specific gene expression. Nucleosomes (i.e. the packaging unit of eukaryotic chromatin) are usually randomly organized on DNA in vivo, but there are particular DNA segments where they are translationally positioned (1Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Wallrath L.L. Lu Q. Granok H. Elgin S.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Such a nucleosome arrangement is often found within gene regulatory regions during the stepwise differentiation process of tissue-specific genes (3McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S.

The specific pattern of nucleosome organization typically occurs only in the tissue(s) where the particular gene is to become active (3McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) or maintained permissive for induction (6Lefevre P. Melnik S. Wilson N. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4386-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The translational nucleosome-positioning event is often correlated with the binding of trans-acting factors to their cognate DNA sites (3McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4386-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism for maintaining a specific translational nucleosome positioning might be by the DNA sequence as such. Previous studies demonstrated that DNA sequence directs nucleosomal organization into a preferred rotational positioning in vivo (7Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro nucleosome reconstitution experiments demonstrated a strong rotational positioning directed by a artificial DNA-bending sequences (8Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, such DNA-bending sequences did not confer detectable translational nucleosome positioning in vivo (10Lu Q. Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C.

LTR is known to harbor six translationally positioned nucleosomes, nucleosomes A–F, along its 1.2 kb of DNA (12Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L.

This specific chromatin organization was first reported to occur in tissue culture cells such as NIH3T3 cells (12Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and in human breast cancer cells T47D (13Truss M. Bartsch J. Schulbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A similar translational nucleosome positioning was seen both in the absence and in the presence of hormone induction, albeit a distinct hormone-dependent DNase I-hypersensitive site, also revealed by hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis, was developed at the cluster of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites (i.e. the glucocorticoid response elements (GREs)) (12Richard-Foy H.

A high resolution mapping of the translationally positioned nucleosomes of the inactive MMTV promoter showed a broad distribution of differently positioned nucleosomes (14Fragoso G. John S.

In vitro nucleosome reconstitution experiments with MMTV LTR DNA from the B-nucleosome region demonstrated a strongly preferred frame of rotational positioning (16Perlmann T. Wrange O.

The in vitro nucleosome reconstitution experiments also indicated a preferred translational nucleosome positioning similar to the organization seen in vivo, but they were conducted on rather small DNA segments (16Perlmann T.

In addition, in vitro chromatin reconstitution experiments of circular plasmid DNA harboring the MMTV LTR using Drosophila embryo extracts also suggested a preferred translational nucleosome positioning over the B-nucleosome region (21Venditti P. Di Croce L. Kauer M. Blank T. Becker P.B. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggested that the DNA sequence might be of importance in setting up the constitutive translational nucleosome positioning of the MMTV LTR also in vivo. The two ubiquitously expressed transcription factors nuclear factor 1 (NF1) (22Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and the POU-homeodomain octamer-binding factor 1 (Oct1) (23Phillips K. Luisi B. J. Mol.

This revealed the importance of these two factors for basal as well as hormone-induced transcription at the MMTV promoter. Importantly, both NF1 (13Truss M. Bartsch J. Schulbert A. Hache R.J.G.

These findings have led to the formulation of the “two-step” model as the mechanism for GR-activated MMTV transcription. It postulates that the nucleosomes in the MMTV LTR are constitutively positioned, possibly by virtue of the DNA sequence, and that this precise nucleosome positioning excludes binding of NF1, Oct1, and other basal transcription factors. The first part of the “two-step” induction is initiated by the hormone-activated GR, which binds sequence specifically to the GREs and recruits co-activator(s) and effectuates chromatin remodeling, resulting in an opened chromatin structure. The second step constitutes binding of NF1, Oct1, and other basal factors to the more accessible DNA, leading to induction of transcription (31Beato M. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Hager G.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 279-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the reconstitution of the MMTV LTR chromatin structure by nuclear injection into Xenopus oocytes revealed a different picture. Here, the nucleosomes were randomly positioned in the absence of hormone, whereas the translational nucleosome positioning and the DNase I hypersensitivity at the GRE cluster were seen only after GR-mediated hormone induction (33Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lack of prepositioned nucleosomes in oocytes suggested that the constitutive translational nucleosome positioning seen in other cells is driven by factor(s) that are absent in Xenopus oocytes. We recently demonstrated that NF1 is able to bind to its DNA site in the inactive promoter (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, NF1 binding was weak in the absence of GR activation, and a 50-fold higher NF1 binding efficiency was seen in the hormone-induced state. We also showed that NF1 requires the co-expression of Oct1 in order to elicit a transcriptional effect (i.e. an increased basal and hormone-induced transcription from the MMTV promoter). Here we address the effect of these two factors on the MMTV chromatin structure in relation to their capacity to bind to DNA and to induce MMTV transcription in the absence and presence of hormone activation. NF1 and Oct1 reciprocally enhance each other's DNA binding in vivo. Importantly, these two factors cooperate in mediating an intermediary level of nucleosome rearrangements within the MMTV LTR as compared with that seen after GR induction (33Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hormone-induced GR binding and gene induction event is considerably faster in the presence of NF1 and Oct1. Hence, we refer to this structural state as a preset chromatin structure. We propose that the presetting of this retroviral enhancer/promoter plays a role in the virus life cycle and may be reminiscent of the stepwise and trans-acting factor-mediated chromatin presetting that occur during the establishment of tissue- and developmental-specific gene expression. Plasmids—The DNA construct referred to as the MMTV reporter DNA is pMMTV:M13, which harbors the 1.2-kb MMTV LTR fused to the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene at position +137 of the MMTV promoter (33Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The construction of the plasmids for in vitro production of mRNA for rat GR (33Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), pig NF1-C1 (here referred to as NF1), and human Oct 1 (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have been described earlier. The pig NF1-C1:DBD, a C-terminal deletion of the NF1-C1 where amino acid residues 1–228 were maintained, thus ending with a threonine residue at the C terminus, was constructed for mRNA production. It was generated with a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer 5′-GTCAGAATTCACAGCCACCATGTATTCGTCCCCGCTCTG-3′ and the C-terminal primer 5′-GTCAGCGGCCGCTCAAGTGACACTGAACACACCAGAGG-3′. The PCR product and the RN3P vector DNA (34Zernika-Goetz M. Pines J. Ryan K. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Gurdon J.B. Development. 1996; 122: 3719-3724PubMed Google Scholar) were cut with EcoRI and NotI and purified with QIAquick (Qiagen) from SeaPlaque GTG-agarose gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) followed by ligation and plasmid preparation according to standard procedures. The construction of pMMTVΔNF1:M13, where the –77/–63 NF1 site was deleted and an XhoI site was introduced without changing the promoter spacing, was made by a PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTCGAGCAGACAGTCTTATGTAAATGCTTATGTAA-3′ (coding strand) and 3′-GATCTCGAGTCTAAGAACATAGGAAAATAGAACAC-3′ (noncoding strand) from the template pBSMTV:Tk(-XhoI) (i.e. the same MMTV:Tk construct as above but moved into the pBluescript® vector) (Stratagene). After trimming with XhoI and ligation, the construct thus obtained was transferred to M13 mp18 by restriction sites KpnI and XbaI and used for preparation of single-stranded DNA. The construction of pMMTVΔOctdΔOctp:M13, where both Oct sites had been deleted, was performed in the same way using oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTCGAGTCTCGACAATAATATAAAAGAGTGCTGA-3′ (coding strand) and 5′-GATCTCGAGACATAAGACTTGGATAGATTCC-3′ (noncoding strand). Oocyte injections have been described previously (35Belikov S. Gelius B. Wrange O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2802-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hormone, triamcinolone acetonide (TA), was added to the oocyte medium at 1 μm concentration. GR mRNA was not injected in some of the oocyte pools that were not to be treated with hormone in order to avoid possible hormone contamination-mediated effects. Quantification of Intranuclear Transcription Factors—Oocytes were injected with RNA coding for GR and Oct1 proteins and placed in oocyte medium, OR2, also containing [35S]methionine, 1000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 0.02 μCi/μl medium overnight. Then the nuclei were dissected and analyzed in pools of five by 12% SDS-PAGE (36Gelius B. Wrange O. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Relative amounts GR and Oct1 were estimated by quantification on a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS-2500 using the Image Gauge version 3.3 software with correction of the methionine content in the respective proteins as previously described for calculation of intranuclear concentration of NF1 (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An aliquot was also analyzed by immunoblotting with GR antiserum together with known amounts of GR purified from rat liver (16Perlmann T. Wrange O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) to serve as a standard curve for calculation of absolute amounts of Oct1 that followed a linear correlation between injected RNA and translated protein. 2C. Åstrand and Ö. Wrange, unpublished results. Based on these calculations done in different oocyte experiments with the same mRNA preparations and a similar time of translation, about 24 h, the intranuclear amounts of GR (after hormone treatment), NF1, and Oct1 were about 0.1, 0.01, and 0.06 pmol, respectively, in a typical injection experiment. Assuming an intranuclear volume of 40 nl, this will result in an intranuclear concentration of 2.5, 0.25, and 1.5 μm for GR, NF1, and Oct1, respectively. Quantification of MMTV transcription by S1-nuclease has been described previously (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All analyses were done in duplicate or triplicate. The oocyte homogenate was split into two aliquots, and then RNA was quantified in one half, and the amount of injected pMMTV:M13 reporter DNA in the other aliquot was quantified by primer extension as for the SacI accessibility assay (see below). Transcription was expressed as the ratio of MMTV RNA/MMTV DNA extracted from the oocyte homogenate. Chromatin and Protein-DNA Interaction Analysis—The SacI accessibility assay, primer extension (33Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), DMS in vivo footprinting (35Belikov S. Gelius B. Wrange O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2802-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in situ cleavage by methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) (MPE) (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were done as described previously. Radioactivity scans and quantifications were carried out with a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS-2500 using the Image Gauge version 3.3 software. Samples were routinely analyzed in duplicate in order to control for experimental variation. NF1 and Dose-dependent Oct1 Stimulation of Hormone-activated MMTV Transcription—The MMTV promoter harbors a cluster of four GR-binding sequences (Fig. 1A, GRE I–IV, white boxes), one NF1-binding site (light gray box), and two octamer-binding sites (black boxes), one proximal (Oct p) and one distal site (Oct d) relative to the TATA sequence (dark gray box). We previously showed that NF1 binds to the MMTV promoter within a wide range of intranuclear concentrations but did not have any effect on MMTV transcription. However, NF1 did stimulate MMTV basal and hormone-induced transcription when coexpressed with Oct1 (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This posed the question of to what extent different Oct1 concentrations affected the hormone-activated MMTV transcription. Xenopus oocytes may be programmed to produce GR, NF1 (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and Oct1 protein (Fig. 1B) by the injection of the corresponding in vitro transcribed mRNA. Here the oocytes were first injected with the single-stranded MMTV reporter DNA that leads to second strand DNA synthesis, a process that is coupled with chromatin assembly and is completed within 3–4 h after single-stranded DNA injection (37Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Then the oocytes were injected either with GR mRNA only or GR mRNA together with NF1 mRNA and in both of these groups together with increasing amounts of Oct1 mRNA. The intranuclear amounts of GR and Oct1 at the highest Oct1 mRNA injection were determined by [35S]methionine labeling to be 85 and 83 fmol for GR and Oct1, respectively (Fig. 1B and data not shown) and about 10 fmol of NF1 (see “Materials and Methods”). The oocytes were assayed for transcription in the absence or in the presence of the glucocorticoid hormone, triamcinolone acetonide (TA), at 1 μm concentration. This revealed a dose-dependent Oct1 stimulation of hormone-induced MMTV transcription, reaching a 3.6- and 4.8-fold stimulation at the highest concentration of intranuclear Oct1 in the absence and in the presence of NF1, respectively (Fig. 2). The level of NF1-mediated stimulation of transcription was within 1.3–1.6-fold and seemed to be at the same relative level from 9 to 83 fmol of intranuclear Oct1, whereas there was no stimulation by NF1 in the absence of Oct1. This result confirms and extends our previous result, where a 1.3-fold stimulation of transcription by NF1 was dependent on the presence of Oct1 (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our finding, reported here, that the stimulation by NF1 in the Oct1 context is about the same over a wide range of Oct1 intranuclear concentrations suggests that NF1 acts via a separate albeit Oct1-dependent mechanism to stimulate MMTV transcription. We also evaluated the transcriptional effect of NF1 and/or Oct1 at subsaturating and saturating concentrations of GR. This was achieved by use of different hormone concentrations that control the level of intranuclear GR (35Belikov S. Gelius B. Wrange O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2802-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Such experiments again showed a distinct stimulation of both basal and hormone-induced transcription in the presence of Oct1 and a further stimulation by NF1 and Oct1 co-expression, whereas NF1 in the absence of Oct1 did not produce any effect either at low or high GR concentration. Although the absolute levels of transcription both in the absence and the presence of hormone varied between experiments, there was a good reproducibility of the effect on transcription by these various factors in relative terms (Supplement 1). We conclude that the positive effect of concomitant expression of Oct1 and NF1 is maintained both at low and high levels of hormone-activated GR and that the stimulatory effect of NF1 is only seen in the presence of Oct1 irrespective of the GR concentration. The MMTV LTR of 1.2 kb harbors binding sites for various transcription factors also in the more distal DNA segments (38Mink S. Hartig E. Jennewein P. Doppler W. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that the NF1 and/or Oct1 effects detected here might be mediated by other, perhaps cryptic, sites within the MMTV LTR. We addressed this by construction of mutants deleting either the NF1 site or the two Oct1 sites (see “Materials and Methods”). Oocytes injected with wild type MMTV LTR or either of these two mutants alone or in combination with mRNA coding for NF1 and Oct1 revealed that the NF1- and Oct1-dependent increase in basal MMTV transcription was indeed dependent on both an intact NF1 site and intact Oct1 binding sites (data not shown). Hence, we conclude that the transcriptional stimulation of these two factors is mediated by their corresponding binding sites located within the MMTV promoter segment as illustrated in Fig. 1A. This is in agreement with previous results of mutational analysis performed in mammalian tissue culture cells (26Buetti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1191-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Toohey M.G. Lee J.W. Huang M. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4477-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that similar NF1- and Oct1-related mechanisms are operating in Xenopus oocytes when these factors are provided. NF1 and Oct1 Cooperatively Induce a Nucleosome Rearrangement in the MMTV LTR in the Absence of Hormone-activated GR—The chemical nuclease MPE was used to monitor the nucleosome organization in the MMTV promoter, since it preferably cleaves internucleosomal linker DNA and lacks sequence-specific DNA cutting activity (12Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 13Truss M. Bartsch J. Schulbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M.

A. 1983; 80: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By first injecting the single-stranded MMTV DNA reporter and then the various combinations of GR, NF1, and Oct1 mRNAs into pools of Xenopus oocytes, we were able to monitor the effects of NF1 and Oct1 on the chromatin structure. Untreated oocytes showed a cleavage pattern of weak bands with an even smear-like background (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). We previously utilized restriction enzyme mapping (33Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and DNase I footprinting (18Belikov S. Astrand C. Holmqvist P.H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to demonstrate that this represents a random translational nucleosome positioning but with a significant level of rotational positioning. In accordance with previous results (33Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange Ö. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1"
https://openalex.org/W2011974549,"The role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2 in the neutrophil chemotactic response remains to be identified since a previously used specific inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, PD98059, that was used to provide evidence for a role of ERK1 and ERK2 in regulating chemotaxis, has recently been reported to also inhibit MEK5. This issue is made more critical by our present finding that human neutrophils express mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)5 and ERK5 (Big MAP kinase), and that their activities were stimulated by the bacterial tripeptide, formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Dose response studies demonstrated a bell-shaped profile of fMLP-stimulated MEK5 and ERK5 activation, but this was left-shifted when compared with the profile of fMLP-stimulated chemotaxis. Kinetics studies demonstrated increases in kinase activity within 2 min, peaking at 3–5 min, and MEK5 activation was more persistent than that of ERK5. There were some similarities as well as differences in the pattern of activation between fMLP-stimulated ERK1 and ERK2, and MEK5-ERK5 activation. The up-regulation of MEK5-ERK5 activities was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Studies with the recently described specific MEK inhibitor, PD184352, at concentrations that inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 but not ERK5 activity demonstrate that the ERK1 and ERK2 modules were involved in regulating fMLP-stimulated chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Our data suggest that the MEK5-ERK5 module is likely to regulate neutrophil responses at very low chemoattractant concentrations whereas at higher concentrations, a shift to the ERK1/ERK2 and p38 modules is apparent.

Neutrophils, while playing an important role in host defense by killing microbial pathogens, are also responsible for tissue destruction in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (1Pillinger M.H.

A crucial initial step in this is the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection and inflammation by a process known as chemotaxis.

These studies showed that PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)1 and MEK2, the immediate upstream regulators of ERK1 and ERK2, inhibited chemotaxis in response to fMLP or IL8. However, PD98059 and another specific MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor, UO126, have recently been reported to also inhibit MEK5, the upstream regulator of ERK5 (8Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 9Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). This therefore creates some doubt as to whether the previous conclusion is valid and whether the MEK5-ERK5 module could also be involved in regulating the chemotactic response. ERK5 or Big MAP kinase (BMK) is a recently described stress-activated MAP kinase (10Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2833) Google Scholar, 11Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This kinase is similar in many aspects to ERK1 and ERK2, but has a unique loop 12 domain within the kinase region, which is followed by an unusually long C terminus. Although murine tissues have been reported to express three forms of ERK5 protein species, generated by alternative splicing (12Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), human tissues contain only one form of the protein, despite alternative splicing in the 5′-non-coding region (11Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The activity of ERK5 is up-regulated through the phosphorylation of the TEY activation motif by MEK5. Alternative splicing at the 5′-end of MEK5 yields MEK5α and MEK5β and alternative splicing between the kinase subdomain IX-X region of each MEK5 species can potentially generate two further MEK5 species (13English J.M.

Kinases such as MEK kinase (MEKK)2, MEKK3, tumor progression locus (Tpl)-2/cancer osaka thyroid (Cot) and mixed lineage kinase (MLK)-like MAP triple kinase have all be been reported to serve as MAP kinase kinase kinases of the ERK5 module (8Kamakura S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

The presence of MEK5 and ERK5 in neutrophils has not been described, and their roles in neutrophils remain unknown. The aims of this study were to characterize the expression and activation of MEK5 and ERK5 in human neutrophils, and to investigate whether this kinase module could regulate neutrophil migration. We have found for the first time, that human neutrophils express MEK5 and ERK5 and the activity of the MEK-ERK5 module was stimulated by fMLP. Activation of the MEK-ERK5 module was blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Investigations with the recently described specific MEK inhibitor, PD184352, at concentrations that inhibited ERK1/ERK2 but not ERK5 activity, provided further evidence that ERK1 and ERK2 are involved in regulating the chemotactic response. Materials—Myelin basic protein, protein A-Sepharose, lucigenin, and fMLP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Pty. Ltd. (Sydney, Australia). The anti-ERK5 (L-19) and anti ERK2 (C-14) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). We also obtained an anti-ERK5 antibody from Sigma-Aldrich and this was used in the majority of our experiments. The anti-MEK5 antibody was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Geneworks (Adelaide, Australia). Mr markers were from MBI Fermentas (Hanover, MD) and Bio-Rad. pUC19/HpaII and SppI/EcoRI DNA markers were from Geneworks (Adelaide, Australia). PD98059 was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc., (Beverly, MA), and PD184352 was obtained from Prof. P. Cohen, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK. Millicell-PCF 3-μm culture inserts were obtained from Millipore Australia (Sydney, Australia). Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Reinforced nitrocellulose was purchased from Schleicher and Schuell (Dassel, Germany). The Western blot recycling kit was obtained from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, Texas). TRIzol® Reagent was purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Mt Waverly, Australia). AMV reverse transcriptase and Expand High Fidelity polymerase were from Roche Diagnostics Australia (Castle Hill, Australia). Q Buffer was from Qiagen Pty. Ltd. (Clifton Hill, Australia). Isolation of Neutrophils and Monocytes—Human neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by the rapid single-step method (20Ferrante A. Thong Y.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 48: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The neutrophil preparation was >98% pure and viable, and were left for 30 min at 37 °C before they were stimulated. Monocytes were prepared from the mononuclear cell fraction by adherence to plasma-coated dishes (21Huang Z.H. Hii C.S. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. Ferrante A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HL60 Promeylocytic and HEK293T Cells—HL60 and human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics and fetal bovine serum (10%) (22Hii C.S. Huang Z.H. Bilney A. Costabile M. Murray A.W. Rathjen D.A. Der C.J. Ferrante A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19277-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HL60 cells were grown at less than 1 × 106 cells/ml. HEK293T cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and used when confluent. Chemotaxis—Neutrophil chemotaxis was investigated by a chamber method and/or the under-agarose method as described previously (4Hii C.S. Stacey K. Moghaddami N. Murray A.W. Ferrante A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the dose response relationship between chemotaxis and fMLP, we used the chamber method because the specific concentrations of a ligand cannot be determined in the under-agarose method because of diffusion of the ligand. For the chamber assay, neutrophils (106 in 500 μl RPMI 1640 that had been supplemented with bovine serum albumin, 2%, w/v) were placed in filter chambers (Millicell culture plate inserts with 3-μm pore size polycarbonate filters). The chambers were then placed into wells (24-well plate) that contained RPMI 1640-bovine serum albumin (0.5 ml) and either fMLP or Me2SO. After 45 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, the inserts were removed and neutrophils that had migrated across the filter and collected on the surface of the wells were harvested by gentle pipetting and counted. Previous studies on the kinetics of neutrophil migration in this system have demonstrated that the majority of neutrophils had migrated across the filter within this period (4Hii C.S. Stacey K. Moghaddami N. Murray A.W. Ferrante A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the under-agarose method, 6 ml of agarose (1% v/v) was allowed to set in culture dishes (60-mm diameter) and wells (sets of 3) were made. To assess the chemotactic response, fMLP (5 × 10–8m), neutrophils (2 × 105), and Me2SO (0.1% v/v), all in 5-μl aliquots, were added to the outer, center and inner wells, respectively, and the dishes were placed in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C for 90 min. In this assay, neutrophils continuously migrate out of the wells in every direction, albeit with the majority of the migrating cells exhibiting directional migration toward the chemoattractant-containing well (23Nelson R.D. Quie P.G. Simmons R.L. J. Immunol. 1975; 115: 1650-1656PubMed Google Scholar). The leading neutrophils form a distinct migrating front. To quantify migration, we measured the distance between the edge of the central well and the migrating front moving toward either the fMLP (chemotaxis) or Me2SO (random migration) containing well using an inverted Leitz microscope fitted with a grid eyepiece graticule. The plates were sealed and stored at 4 °C until photomicrographed. To assess the effect of PD184352, neutrophils (106) were preincubated with the inhibitor or ME2SO for 1 h before being used in the above chemotaxis assays. The cells with the inhibitor or vehicle were placed in the chambers or wells as described above. Cell viability at the end of the pre-incubation period, as judged by the trypan blue exclusion test, was not affected by the inhibitor, with >99% of the cells being able to exclude the dye. Preparation of Cell Lysates—The cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and benzamidine) for 2 h (4 °C) with constant mixing (24Hii C.S. Moghadammi N. Dunbar A. Ferrante A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27246-27255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell debris was sedimented (12,000 × g 30 s), and the protein content of the soluble fractions was determined by the Lowry's protein estimation method. Samples were stored at –20 °C for up to 2 weeks with no apparent loss of kinase activity being detected within this period. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from normal human monocytes and neutrophils using TRIzol® reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with AMV reverse transcriptase using an oligo d(T) primer. PCR primers, analogous to those used by Yan et al. (12Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to amplify murine ERK5, were designed to the human ERK5 sequence. These were: sense primer ACGAGTACGAGATCATCGAGACC, and antisense primer GGTCACCACATCGAAAGCATTAGG. These are designed to amplify a 125-bp fragment (nucleotides 238–362) from the human ERK5 mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number HSU25278). The 5′ primer is located 52 bp 5′ of an exon-intron junction (GenBank™ accession number AC124066, base 17697), and the 3′-primer is located 25 bp 3′ of the same intron (intron-exon junction at bp 17009 of GenBank accession number AC124066). These primers therefore also define a PCR product of 774 bp (GenBank™ accession number AC124066, base 17723–16950) that can be amplified from human genomic DNA. This intron corresponds to the murine sequence reported as being alternatively spliced by Yan et al. (12Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed in 50-μl reactions using 2 μl of cDNA as template, 100 μm of each dNTP, 1 μg of each primer, and 3.5 units of Expand High Fidelity polymerase in a final 1× concentration of the recommended buffer plus 1× Q Buffer (Qiagen Pty. Ltd., Clifton Hill, Australia). Thirty cycles of amplification was performed with each cycle consisting of a denaturation of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and an extension of 68 °C for 30 s. PCR products were resolved on a 2.5% agarose gel with pUC19/HpaII and SppI/EcoRI DNA markers (500 ng). Western Blot—Proteins in the lysates were separated by 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE as appropriate and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Even transfer of proteins between the lanes was confirmed by staining with Ponceau S. Membranes were probed with anti-ERK2, ERK5, MEK5, or p38 antibody using standard procedures, and the immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (25Hii C.S. Ferrante A. Edwards Y.S. Huang Z.H. Hartfield P.J. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4201-4204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In some cases, the blots were stripped using a Western blot recycling kit and reprobed with another antibody. Immunoprecipitation of ERK1, ERK2, ERK5, MEK5, and p38—Lysates, normalized for protein content (1 mg), were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (15 μl of a 1:1 slurry) for 20 min at 4 °C with constant mixing. The supernatants were removed and incubated with an anti-ERK5, ERK2, MEK5, or p38 antibody (3 μg each) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. Protein A-Sepharose was added and after a further 30 min incubation at 4 °C with constant mixing, the immunocomplexes were sedimented and were washed once with buffer A and once with assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3.8 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm Na3VO4, and 20 μm ATP) at 4 °C. The samples were then used in kinase activity assays, kinase quantitation, or Western blot analysis. Kinase Activity Assay—The assay was started by adding 30 μl of assay buffer (30 °C) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 3.8 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 15 μg of myelin basic protein. After 20 min, the assay was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min at 100 °C. Phosphorylated myelin basic protein was resolved by 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was detected and quantitated using an Instant Imager (Packard Instruments). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's unpaired t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test as appropriate. H2O2 Stimulated the Activity of ERK5—Since H2O2 has widely been reported to stimulate the activity of ERK5 (8Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29643-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether H2O2 was able to stimulate the ERK5 module in neutrophils. Neutrophils were incubated with H2O2, lysed, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-ERK5 antibody that was raised against residues 790–803 in the C terminus of human ERK5 (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) and had previously been used for this purpose (15Xu B.E.

Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ERK5 kinase activity was assayed using myelin basic protein as a substrate. Consistent with the data in other cell-types, H2O2 stimulated the kinase activity in the ERK5 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1). In contrast, H2O2 did not stimulate the dual phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2, suggesting that the kinase activity in the ERK5 immunoprecipitates was un-likely to have been caused by contaminating ERK1 or ERK2. Expression of ERK5 and MEK5 in Neutrophils—Previously, we reported that ERK5 in COS-1 monkey kidney cells migrated in SDS gels with an Mr of greater than the top Mr marker of 113,000 (17Dwivedi P.P. Hii C.S. Ferrante A. Tan J. Der C.J. Omdahl J.L. Morris H.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29643-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This is consistent with other reports that ERK5 migrates at 100 or higher (16Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 28Nicol R.L. Frey N. Pearson G. Cobb M. Richardson J. Olson E.N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36989-36992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To characterize the expression of ERK5 in neutrophils, we first subjected neutrophil lysates to Western blotting. The anti-ERK5 antibody detected a number of bands that migrated in SDS gels with Mr of ∼97,000, ∼ 90,000 ∼82,000 and ∼45,000. On prolonged exposure of the film, a faint ∼120-kDa band could also be seen in the neutrophils (Fig. 2a and also Fig. 3b). In contrast, when the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-ERK5 antibody prior to Western blotting, the blots showed predominantly 2 bands of Mr of ∼97,000 and ∼120,000 (Fig. 2b). No bands could be seen if the immunoprecipitation was carried out with an anti-β-actin (Fig. 2c) or ERK2 (Fig. 2d) antibody. This implies that the ∼97- and ∼120-kDa bands were specifically brought down by the anti-ERK5 antibody.Fig. 3PCR analysis of ERK5 mRNA expression in human neutrophils and monocytes and a comparison of ERK5 protein expression between the two cell-types. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from monocytes and neutrophils (a) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The arrows to the left of the figure indicate the hERK5 PCR products amplified from genomic DNA (774 bp) and cDNA (125 bp).

The blot was overexposed to show the faint ∼120-kDa ERK5 band in the neutrophil lysate. Right panel shows lane 2 from a shorter exposure. The results are representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When lysates from human peripheral blood monocytes, human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells, and HL60 cells (not shown) were subjected to Western blotting with the anti-ERK5 antibody, the blots showed the presence of predominantly the ∼120-kDa band (Fig. 2e), although some monocyte samples also contained faster migrating bands (see Fig. 3b). These data imply that the ∼120-kDa band is ERK5. The presence of faster migrating anti-ERK5 immunoreactive bands in cell lysates is not unprecedented as others have previously reported that ERK5 blots sometimes contained multiple immunoreactive bands that had been ascribed to ERK5 degradation products (30English J.M. Pearson G. Bae R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For comparison, lysates from HEK293T cells were also probed with an anti-ERK5 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. According to the manufacturer's specification sheet, this antibody detects a ∼120-kDa ERK5 band. Akin to the antibody from Sigma-Aldrich, the Santa Cruz antibody also detected a ∼120-kDa band in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2e, right lane). Taken together, our data imply that the ∼120-kDa band is ERK5. The faster migrating species are likely to be degradation products (30English J.M. Pearson G. Bae R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The expression of ERK5 in neutrophils was also investigated at the mRNA level. Human placenta has previously been reported to contain three ERK5 transcripts (11Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, since these are generated by alternative splicing in the 5′-non-coding region, only one form of ERK5 is expressed at the protein level (11Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, murine tissues have been reported to contain three isoforms of ERK5 protein, designated mERK5a, mERK5b and mERK5c, which are derived from differential splicing of the N terminus of mERK5 (12Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3a demonstrate the presence of only one species of ERK5 mRNA in both peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils (lanes 2 and 3, lower arrow). The presence of a PCR product corresponding to genomic DNA in the neutrophil cDNA sample (lane 3, upper arrow) demonstrates that the PCR would be capable of detecting larger, alternatively spliced, mRNA species analogous to those found in mice, if they were present. In the absence of reverse transcriptase RNA templates (lanes 4 and 5), only the product corresponding to genomic DNA was seen (lane 7) i"

The enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus, a hyperthermophilic organism of ancient lineage, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein was found to be a 45-kDa monomer containing a single zinc ion. Although there is no other DHOase gene in the A. aeolicus genome, the recombinant protein completely lacked catalytic activity at any temperature tested. However, DHOase formed an active complex with aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) from the same organism. Whereas the kcat of 13.8 ± 0.03 s–1 was close to the value observed for the mammalian enzyme, the K mfor dihydroorotate, 3.03 ± 0.05 mm was 433-fold higher. Gel filtration and chemical cross-linking showed that the complex exists as a 240-kDa hexamer (DHO3-ATC3) and a 480-kDa duodecamer (DHO6-ATC6) probably in rapid equilibrium. Complex formation protects both DHOase and ATCase against thermal degradation at temperatures near 100 °C where the organism grows optimally. These results lead to the reclassification of both enzymes: ATCase, previously considered a Class C homotrimer, now falls into Class A, whereas the DHOase is a Class 1B enzyme. CD spectroscopy indicated that association with ATCase does not involve a significant perturbation of the DHOase secondary structure, but the visible absorption spectrum of a Co2+-substituted DHOase is appreciably altered upon complex formation suggesting a change in the electronic environment of the active site. The association of DHOase with ATCase probably serves as a molecular switch that ensures that free, uncomplexed DHOase in the cell remains inactive. At pH 7.4, the equilibrium ratio of carbamoyl aspartate to dihydroorotate is 17 and complex formation may drive the reaction in the biosynthetic direction.

DHOases from different species constitute a highly polymorphic family of enzymes (3Fields C. Brichta D. Shephardson M. Farinha M. O'Donovan G. Paths to Pyrimidines. 1999; 7: 49-63Google Scholar).

The x-ray structure of E. coli DHOase (6Thoden J.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Neal T.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M.

The isolated domain exists in a concentration dependent equilibrium of catalytically active monomers and dimers and contains 1 equivalent of tightly bound zinc per monomer. The mammalian domain has the zinc binding signature motif (8Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Zimmermann B.H. Scully J.L. Kim H. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the initial steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway are identical in hamster CAD (accession PO8955), yeast (accession PO7259), Aquifex aeolicus (accession NP213551), and E. coli (accession BAA35870), the structural organization of the enzymes that catalyze these reactions are different. Carbamoyl phosphate synthesis, the first step in the pyrimidine pathway, is catalyzed by the concerted action of three domains, an amidotransferase domain (GLN) and two synthetase domains (CPS.A, CPS.B). In A. aeolicus, all three are separate polypeptides, whereas CPS.A and CPS.B are fused in the E. coli enzyme and all three domains are present in one polypeptide in mammals and yeast. A. aeolicus ATCase, like the mammalian multifunctional protein, is unregulated and lacks the regulatory polypeptides (Reg) found in the E. coli enzyme. The CAD polypeptide also has an active DHOase domain, whereas the homologous region of the yeast protein is an inactive pseudo-DHOase (p-DHOase) and there is a separate yeast monofunctional DHOase. The sequence of the first 180 residues of A. aeolicus DHOase is shown aligned using BLAST with the sequences of the mammalian (CAD), yeast p-DHOase domain (YST), and the E. coli (ECO) enzymes. The extensions on the amino end of the mammalian and yeast proteins are part of the CPSase domain. Similar residues are shaded and the metal binding signature sequence is boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, the bifunctional CAD homolog (Fig. 1) encoded by the yeast ura2 locus has CPSase and ATCase activities, but lacks DHOase activity (14Lollier M. Jaquet L. Nedeva T. Lacroute F. Potier S. Souciet J.L. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis (15Souciet J-L. Nagy M. Legouar M. Lacroute F. Potier S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed that the polypeptide contains a domain that is homologous to CAD DHOase, but is inactive due in part to the missing metal binding signature sequence. This type of pseudo-dihydroorotase domain was subsequently found in several other organisms (16Christopherson R.I. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12506-12512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Pseudomonas ATCase is a duodecameric molecule consisting of six ATCase catalytic chains and six polypeptides (17Bergh S.T. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but it lacks the zinc binding ligands and is inactive.Extensive phylogenetic analysis (3Fields C. Brichta D. Shephardson M. Farinha M. O'Donovan G. Paths to Pyrimidines. 1999; 7: 49-63Google Scholar) of the DHOase sequences from 82 organisms resulted in the classification of these enzymes into two major groups. Type I DHOases are the most ancient form of the enzyme with a subunit mass of ∼45 kDa. The type I enzymes exist as multifunctional proteins (e.g. mammalian CAD), multienzyme complexes (e.g. Thermus aquaticus), or as monofunctional enzymes (e.g. Bacillus subtilis). Type II DHOases, such as those found in E. coli are considered a more recent evolutionary development. These enzymes are smaller (∼38 kDa), containing only the catalytic core and are shorter by an average of 50 and 10 residues on the amino and carboxyl ends, respectively.The enzymes that initiate pyrimidine biosynthesis in Aquifex aeolicus, an extreme hyperthermophile occupying the deepest branch of the eubacterial phylogenetic tree, have an unusual structural organization (Fig. 1). The CPSase (21Ahuja A. Purcarea C. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45694-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of one copy of an amidotransferase subunit (GLN) and two synthetase subunits (CPS.A and CPS.B), whereas ATCase (22Purcarea C.

The DHOase from A. aeolicus has been classified (3Fields C. Brichta D. Shephardson M. Farinha M. O'Donovan G. Paths to Pyrimidines. 1999; 7: 49-63Google Scholar) on the basis of its size and sequence as a type I DHOase. Compared with the E. coli enzyme, A. aeolicus DHOase is 44 residues longer on the amino end, 7 residues longer on the carboxyl end, has only 13% sequence identity and contains several large insertions and deletions (Fig. 1). A. aeolicus DHOase has been cloned and expressed for structural studies (23Purcarea C. Martin P. Vickrey J.F. Guy H.I. Edwards B.F. Evans D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although an analysis of its sequence shows that it has the zinc binding signature motif and that all of the other residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding are conserved, it completely lacked catalytic activity. However, we found that a stoichiometric complex of A. aeolicus DHOase and ATCase could be reconstituted and was fully active.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Reagents including aspartate, carbamoyl aspartate, dihydroorotate, antipyrine, diacetyl monoxime, triethanolamine, spectinomycin, and cross-linked phosphorylase b standards were all obtained from Sigma; dimethyl suberimidate was from Pierce; Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution was from Amersham Biosciences. Gel-Bond PAG sheets were obtained from FMC BioProducts. The bacterial strain, BL21(DE3), used for expression of recombinant proteins was obtained from Stratagene.Expression and Isolation of the Recombinant Proteins—The 1.3-kb pyrC gene encoding A. aeolicus DHOase was cloned into pRSET (Invitrogen), an expression vector that incorporates a His tag on the amino end of the recombinant protein. The resulting construct, pAapyrC (23Purcarea C. Martin P. Vickrey J.F. Guy H.I. Edwards B.F. Evans D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Yokota H. Clark A. Kim S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 207-210Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (23Purcarea C. Martin P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45694-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as previously described.Enzyme Assays—The ATCase activity was assayed by measuring the time dependent formation of carbamoyl aspartate using the colorimetric procedure of Prescott and Jones (25Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 26Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The assay mixture consisted of 2 mm aspartate, 5 mm carbamoyl phosphate, and 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, in a total volume of 0.30 ml. Following pre-equilibration at 75 °C for 1.5 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of typically 4 μg of purified ATCase. After 1.5 min, the assay was quenched with 1 ml of the antipyrine/diacetyl monoxime reagent. DHOase activity was measured in the reverse direction, the formation of carbamoyl aspartate from dihydroorotate, because the equilibrium strongly favors dihydroorotate hydrolysis (27Christopherson R.I. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3358-3370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under these conditions. The formation of carbamoyl aspartate was measured using the same colorimetric method. The assay mixture, consisting of 45 μg of DHOase and, where indicated, a stoichiometric amount of ATCase or CPSase or both, in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 10% glycerol, was preincubated for 1.5 min at 75 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of dihydroorotate (8 mm or variable) and quenched after 1.5 min by the addition of 1 ml of the diacetyl monoxime/antipyrine reagent.Gel Filtration Chromatography—Molecular mass estimates were obtained by gel filtration chromatography on either a 1.5 × 62 or 1.5 × 120-cm Sephacryl S-300 high resolution column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.35, 200 mm sodium chloride, and 10% glycerol. A 1-ml sample, 7–10 mg/ml protein, was applied and the column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected and analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and by enzyme assays. The columns were calibrated with bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and blue dextran or with myoglobin (17 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), and blue dextran.Chemical Cross-linking—The reaction mixture consisted of 30 μg of protein in 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl and either 1 or 10 mm dimethyl suberimidate in a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of dimethyl suberimidate, allowed to proceed for various periods of time at 23 °C, and quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient gels as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). To determine the subunit structure of the larger species, the reaction mixture was fractionated on a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, and 1% SDS as described by Weber and Osborn (29Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Davies and Stark (30Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). No stacking gel was used and “gel-bond PAG” sheets were employed while casting the gels to provide additional support. The glass plate was silanized with Rain-X®. The gel was stored overnight at 4 °C to ensure complete polymerization. The samples were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in sample buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.015% bromphenol blue, and 6 m urea and loaded on the gel. The electrophoresis was carried out for 5 h at a constant current of 50 mA/gel using 33 mm sodium phosphate as the running buffer. Cross-linked phosphorylase b served as the molecular weight markers. Six bands were detected for the standard, ranging from monomer (97.4 kDa) to hexamer (584 kDa). The Coomassie-stained gels were quantitated by scanning with a HP ScanJet 4c and the integrated intensity was measured using the software UNSCAN-IT (Silk Scientific Corp.).Preparation and Spectroscopy of Cobalt-DHOase—Zinc was removed from the A. aeolicus DHOase active site by following the protocol developed (31Huang D.T. Thomas M.A. Christopherson R.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9964-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for the mammalian enzyme. The purified protein (3.5 mg/ml) was dialyzed at 4 °C against 500 ml of 50 mm MES, 50 mm Na2SO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 30% glycerol, 25 mm pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate, pH 6.0, for 3 days, changing the buffer every 24-h. The apo-DHO preparation was desalted by dialysis 2 times for 1 h against 50 mm MES, pH 6.3, 20% glycerol, 1 mm Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). Extraction of zinc was confirmed by spectroscopic assays using the metallochromatic indicator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (32Zimmermann B.H. Kemling N.M. Evans D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7038-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) after dialysis to remove the chelating agents. The cobalt DHOase derivative was prepared by a 4-fold dilution of the apoenzyme in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 30% glycerol, 0.1 mm TCEP, and 0.5 mm CoCl2. The mixture was kept at 4 °C for 3 days and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer. The absorption spectrum of the Co2+·DHOase preparation was determined between 400 and 700 nm at room temperature using a Beckman Coulter 640 DU spectrometer. The Co2+·DHOase·ATCase complex was prepared by mixing Co2+·DHOase with ATCase in 1:1 molar ratio and the absorption spectrum was determined.CD Spectrometry—The CD spectra of DHOase (0.34 mg/ml), ATCase (0.25 mg/ml), and the DHOase·ATCase complex, prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of DHOase and ATCase subunits, in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, were obtained in the wavelength range of 190–320 nm using a Jasco CD spectrometer and quartz SUPRASIL cells.Metal Analysis—Metal analysis was carried out by atomic absorption spectroscopy at the University of Georgia Chemical Analysis Facility (Athens, GA).RESULTSCharacterization of A. aeolicus DHOase—A. aeolicus DHOase was isolated from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the plasmid pAapyrC (23Purcarea C. Martin P. Vickrey J.F. Guy H.I. Edwards B.F. Evans D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although a significant fraction of the protein was found in inclusion bodies, the soluble protein was expressed at high levels, 100 mg/liter, and could be isolated in a single step by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Purified DHOase was homogeneous and could be readily crystallized (23Purcarea C. Martin P. Vickrey J.F. Guy H.I. Edwards B.F. Evans D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the gene sequence was confirmed to be free of errors by DNA sequencing, the recombinant protein had no detectable catalytic activity (Table I). The enzyme was assayed under a variety of conditions; pH ranging from 7.5 to 9.0, substrate concentrations from 10 μm to 8 mm, temperatures from 37 to 75 °C, and 0.01–1 m buffer concentration. Only trace catalytic activity was ever observed, e.g. a 30-min assay of 93 μg of DHOase at 60 °C gave a specific activity of 0.002 μmol/min/mg.Table IDihydroorotase activityProteinActivitya45 μg of A. aeolicus DHOase, with or without the addition of a stoichiometric amount of the other proteins and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was assayed at 75 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”μmol/minDHO<0.02DHO, BSA<0.02DHO, GLN, CPS.A, CPS.B, ATC0.44DHO, GLN, CPS.A, CPS.B, ATC, β-mercaptoethanol<0.02a 45 μg of A. aeolicus DHOase, with or without the addition of a stoichiometric amount of the other proteins and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was assayed at 75 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Metal ion analysis indicated that the protein contained 0.8 mol eq of zinc (23Purcarea C.

Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6989-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Prior to metal analysis, DHOase was exhaustively dialyzed against EDTA, so it is possible that a second loosely bound metal ion was lost during dialysis. However, the DHOase activity was not recovered upon the addition of 0.2 mm zinc chloride. The analysis indicated that other metals, including Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ represented less than 0.01 mol/mol of DHOase. The addition of 0.2 mm CoCl2, NiCl2, MnCl2, and CaCl2 had no significant effect, although a slight activation was observed at high concentrations (10 mm) of some of the divalent cations (Table II). Monovalent cations are known to be essential for the catalytic activity of N-methylhydantoin amidohydrolase (33Ogawa J. Kim J. Nirdnoy W. Amano Y. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a closely related enzyme.

Open table in a new tab Unexpectedly, the inclusion of 1:1 stoichiometric amounts of purified A. aeolicus ATCase and the CPSase subunits, GLN, CPS.A, and CPS.B, to the assay restored the catalytic activity of the DHOase (Table I). It was possible that the other proteins may have nonspecifically stabilized the DHOase structure. However, catalytic activity was not recovered when the assay was conducted in the presence of bovine serum albumin, suggesting that one or more of the A. aeolicus enzymes form a specific complex with DHOase. Like the E. coli enzyme (1Washabaugh M.W. Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3293-3298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the DHOase activity of the putative complex was inhibited by β-mercaptoethanol.As described below, A. aeolicus DHOase was stable at temperatures near 100 °C. However, previous studies (21Ahuja A. Purcarea C. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45694-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that the GLN·CPS.A·CPS.B complex was denatured above 80 °C, so that a temperature of 75 °C was chosen for routine assays. The substrate, dihydroorotate was also verified to be stable at temperatures up to 100 °C (data not shown). A dihydroorotate saturation curve (not shown) carried out at 75 °C in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of GLN, CPS.A, CPS.B, and ATCase was hyperbolic. A non-linear least squares fit of the saturation curve to the Michaelis-Menten equation gave a Km of 3.03 ± 0.05 mm and a Vmax of 17.1 ± 0.04 μmol/min/mg of DHOase, corresponding to a kcat for the putative DHO synthesizing complex of 13.8 ± 0.03 s–1.Identification of the Complex—Titrations were carried out (Fig. 2A) to determine which of the other proteins interact with DHOase to confer catalytic activity. A fixed concentration of DHOase was titrated with an equimolar mixture of the CPSase subunits, GLN, CPS.A, CPS.B, and ATCase. The DHOase activity linearly increased and then leveled off as the DHOase became saturated. The end point corresponded to a molar ratio of 1 to 1.2, suggesting that a stoichiometric complex was formed. A similar titration of the DHOase with ATCase alone also showed a recovery of DHOase activity. The end point corresponded to a 1 to 1.2 complex of DHOase and ATCase, but in this case, the increase in activity was somewhat more gradual suggesting that the CPSase subunits may enhance the stability of the ATCase-DHOase complex. In contrast, the presence of the CPSase subunits alone had no effect on the DHOase catalytic activity. This experiment indicated that ATCase alone specifically activates DHOase.Fig. 2Titration of A. aeolicus DHOase with ATCase and CPSase. Panel A, a constant amount of DHOase (45 μg) was mixed with increasing amounts of GLN/CPS.A/CPS.B (18–900 μg, •), ATCase (3.7–185 μg, ▪), and a mixture of GLN/CPS.A/CPS.B and ATCase (21.7–1085 μg, ○). The total protein was kept constant (1130 μg) by making up the difference with bovine serum albumin. Panel B, a constant amount of ATCase (4 μg) was titrated with increasing amounts of GLN/CPS.A/CPS.B (1.9–112 μg, ▪), DHOase (0.5–32 μg, •) and a mixture of GLN/CPS.A/CPS.B and DHOase (2.4–144 μg, ○).

To determine whether DHOase or CPSase influences the function of the A. aeolicus ATCase, a similar series of titrations (Fig. 2B) were carried out holding the ATCase concentration constant. Neither DHOase, CPSase, nor an equimolar mixture of the two enzymes had any significant effect on the ATCase activity.Oligomeric Structure of A. aeolicus DHOase—Under denaturing conditions, DHOase had an estimated molecular mass of 49 kDa, in good agreement with the calculated mass deduced from the amino acid sequence when the molecular mass of the His tag is taken into consideration. Gel filtration chromatography of purified DHOase on a calibrated Sephacryl S-300 column showed that the protein eluted as a single symmetrical peak (Fig. 3A) with a calculated molecular mass of 53 kDa. The fractions constituting the peak were found to be catalytically active in the presence of excess purified A. aeolicus ATCase added to the assay, but had no activity when the ATCase was omitted from the assay mixture.

https://openalex.org/W2062022550,"KIT ligand (KL) and its receptor, c-kit, are coexpressed in many types of cancer cells and have been implicated in tumor growth and angiogenesis. While Sertoli cell-specific regulation of the KL promoter has been well characterized, regulation in cancer cells remains to be elucidated. We recently reported microarray results demonstrating that increased high-mobility group (HMG) A1a protein expression correlates with increased KL transcription in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Sequence analysis indicates a potential for multiple HMGA1 binding sites within the human KL promoter. In order to better define the underlying molecular mechanisms that HMGA1 uses to facilitate malignant transformation of cancer cells, we have used a variety of methods to determine whether HMGA1a directly regulates the human KL promoter in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Our results indicate that: (i) KL promoter activity is significantly higher in MCF-7 cells overexpressing HMGA1a; (ii) HMGA1a protein binds to AT-rich regions of the KL promoter DNA both in vitro and in vivo; (iii) mutation of the AT-rich regions inhibits HMGA1a binding in vitro; and (iv) HMGA1a-specific inhibition significantly decreases transcription of KL in OCC1 human ovarian cancer cells. In addition, MCF-7 cells with transgenic HMGA1 overexpression stained positive for the KL protein by immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, and were growth-inhibited by KL neutralization. The cumulative evidence indicates that HMGA1 positively regulates the human KL promoter in breast and ovarian cancer cells and implicates serum KL as a diagnostic marker for HMGA1-positive carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2075041313,"The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene is involved in lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia through chromosome translocations leading to fusion of MLL to partner genes, or through internal MLL rearrangements. MLL is the mammalian counterpart of the Drosophila trithorax (trx) gene, involved in maintaining active gene expression states. We have used transgenic Drosophila to assess the molecular targets and cellular processes affected by MLL and two of its leukemic fusion proteins. We find that whereas expression of normal human MLL in flies does not result in phenotypic alterations, overexpressing the human MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 proteins causes larval to pupal lethality, which interestingly resembles the phenotypes displayed by certain Drosophila trx mutant alleles. MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 transgenic flies exhibit antagonistic alterations in cell cycle progression. Additionally, flies expressing MLL-AF9 display impairment in higher order chromatin integrity, evidenced in decondensation of mitotic figures. The effects of MLL fusion proteins in Drosophila suggest that alteration of chromatin structure by MLL fusion proteins may contribute to the lethal phenotype. Our results indicate that the mode(s) of action of MLL-AF9 in Drosophila varies from that of MLL-AF4. Taken together, the expression of MLL fusion proteins in Drosophila provides a new and powerful system to reveal and characterize biological activities associated with MLL fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1978437082,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-1 and mammalian tolloid (mTld) are Ca2+-dependent metalloproteinases that result from alternative splicing of the bmp1 gene. They have different proteinase activities, e.g. BMP-1 effectively cleaves procollagen (an extracellular matrix protein) and chordin (a BMP antagonist), whereas mTld is a poor procollagen proteinase and will not cleave chordin in the absence of twisted gastrulation. This is perplexing because mTld (being the longer variant) might be expected to cleave all substrates cleaved by BMP-1. Studies have shown that the minimal structure for procollagen proteinase activity is proteinase-CUB1-CUB2 (BMP-1ΔEC3) and therefore lacking the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain thought to account for the Ca2+ dependence of BMP-1. In this study we generated three deletion mutants of mTld that lacked either one or both EGF-like domains (referred to as “mTld-ΔEGF”). The mutated proteins were poorly but sufficiently secreted from 293-EBNA cells for in vitro assays of procollagen and chordin cleavage. Most surprisingly, the mTld-ΔEGF mutants required Ca2+ for proteolytic activity, thereby showing that the EGF-like domains do not account for the Ca2+ dependence of BMP-1/mTld. Moreover, the mTld-ΔEGFs are effective procollagen proteinases and cleave chordin. Furthermore, BMP-1ΔEC3 cleaves chordin and requires Ca2+ for activity. Studies using nondenaturing gels showed that mTld molecules lacking EGF-like domains have a loose conformation such that in the presence of Ca2+ binding sites for chordin and procollagen on the “BMP-1-part” of the molecule are exposed. We propose that the EGF-like domains could hold CUB4/5 domains in locations that exclude substrates cleavable by BMP-1. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-1 and mammalian tolloid (mTld) are Ca2+-dependent metalloproteinases that result from alternative splicing of the bmp1 gene. They have different proteinase activities, e.g. BMP-1 effectively cleaves procollagen (an extracellular matrix protein) and chordin (a BMP antagonist), whereas mTld is a poor procollagen proteinase and will not cleave chordin in the absence of twisted gastrulation. This is perplexing because mTld (being the longer variant) might be expected to cleave all substrates cleaved by BMP-1. Studies have shown that the minimal structure for procollagen proteinase activity is proteinase-CUB1-CUB2 (BMP-1ΔEC3) and therefore lacking the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain thought to account for the Ca2+ dependence of BMP-1. In this study we generated three deletion mutants of mTld that lacked either one or both EGF-like domains (referred to as “mTld-ΔEGF”). The mutated proteins were poorly but sufficiently secreted from 293-EBNA cells for in vitro assays of procollagen and chordin cleavage. Most surprisingly, the mTld-ΔEGF mutants required Ca2+ for proteolytic activity, thereby showing that the EGF-like domains do not account for the Ca2+ dependence of BMP-1/mTld. Moreover, the mTld-ΔEGFs are effective procollagen proteinases and cleave chordin. Furthermore, BMP-1ΔEC3 cleaves chordin and requires Ca2+ for activity. Studies using nondenaturing gels showed that mTld molecules lacking EGF-like domains have a loose conformation such that in the presence of Ca2+ binding sites for chordin and procollagen on the “BMP-1-part” of the molecule are exposed. We propose that the EGF-like domains could hold CUB4/5 domains in locations that exclude substrates cleavable by BMP-1.

BMP-1 belongs to the tolloid group of astacin-like metalloproteinases that are fundamental to tissue patterning and extracellular matrix assembly in animals. The proteinase is synthesized as a proprotein (from the N terminus) consisting of a signal peptide, a prodomain (which is cleaved by dibasic furin-like proprotein convertases (3Leighton M.

The importance of BMP-1 in tissue assembly and development is illustrated in bmp1 homozygous null mice, which are perinatal lethal and have defects in ventral body wall closure and collagen fibrillogenesis (18Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mTld is the longer splice variant of the bmp1 gene. The mTld protein is identical to BMP-1 except that it contains one additional EGF-like domain and two additional CUB domains at its C terminus. The most C-terminal end of the protein contains a sequence specific to mTld. Thus, mTld contains five CUB domains and two EGF-like domains, which in other proteins are involved in protein-protein interactions and Ca2+ binding, respectively. The EGF-like domains consist of 40 amino acids, in which there are six highly conserved cysteine residues that form three disulfide bridges. Two types of 6-cysteine EGF-like domains have been observed, one of which (cbEGF) has a high affinity for Ca2+. Calcium ion binding occurs in domains containing the consensus sequence (D/N)X(D/N)(E/Q)(X)m(D/N)*(X)n(Y/F), where X is any amino acid; m and n are integers; and * indicates possible β-hydroxylation (19Cooke R.M. Wilkinson A.J. Baron M. Pastore A. Tappin M.J. Campbell I.D. Gregory H. Sheard B. Nature. 1987; 327: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In a previous study (20Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we showed that the EGF-like and CUB3 domains of BMP-1 are not required for cleavage of type I procollagen. Thus the minimal domain structure for procollagen C-proteinase activity is as follows: metalloproteinase-CUB1-CUB2-specific domain (BMP-1ΔEC3). The efficiency with which the minimal C-proteinase cleaves procollagen is in contrast to the poor C-proteinase activity of mTld. We hypothesized that the poor C-proteinase activity of mTld was the result of conformational differences between BMP-1 and mTld, which are the result of the second EGF-like domain or the CUB4 and/or CUB5 domains. These proteinases have proved difficult to study by high resolution structure determination techniques such as x-ray crystallography because they are multidomain glycoproteins that are refractory to crystallization. Thus, we used the approach to engineer site-directed mutations into the mTld molecule to determine the structural basis for the poor C-proteinase activity of mTld. The functional differences between BMP-1 and mTld are not restricted to the ability to cleave the C-propeptides of procollagen. A major substrate for BMP-1 is chordin, which, significantly, is not cleaved by mTld, at least in the absence of twisted gastrulation (21Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G.

Chordin forms latent complexes with BMP2/4 and BMP4/7, thereby preventing the BMPs from binding to cognate receptors (31Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M.

We generated a series of mTld mutants lacking one or both EGF-like domains, expressed and purified the variant proteins. We found that the ΔEGF mutants were expressed at similar levels to wild-type mTld but were not efficiently secreted from the cells. Wild-type BMP-1 and the mutated BMP-1 lacking its EGF and CUB3 domains (BMP-1ΔEC3) were also included in our study. We showed that mTld-ΔEGF1, mTld-ΔEGF2, mTld-ΔEGF1 + 2, and BMP-1ΔEC3 remained calcium ion-dependent. The mTld-ΔEGF mutants were better C-proteinases than mTld in the presence of Ca2+ and acquired chordinase activity. Furthermore, the chordinase activity was retained by BMP-1ΔEC3. Although wild-type mTld undergoes little conformational change upon Ca2+ binding, the mTld-ΔEGF mutants were compact in the absence of Ca2+. We conclude that the EGF-like domains do not account for Ca2+ dependence and that they are structure stiffeners. We hypothesize that they may function to hold the CUB4 and -5 domains of mTld in locations that exclude substrates cleavable by BMP-1. Source of Materials—Full-length BMP-1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number M22488) was cloned from a human placental cDNA library. A His6 tag amino acid sequence was introduced into the BMP-1 sequence (BMP-1-His) immediately 5′ of the stop codon. The cDNA encoding His-tagged BMP-1 was subcloned into the episomal expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Both wild-type BMP-1 and BMP-1 minimal structure for C-proteinase activity (i.e. BMP-1ΔEC3, lacking EGF and CUB3 (20Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol.

Mammalian tolloid (mTld) (GenBank™ accession number U50330) was obtained by synthesis of the sequence from position 1883 to the stop codon (Genscript). A V5-His6 tag amino acid sequence (GKPIPNPLLGLDST-(His)6) was introduced into the mTld sequence immediately 5′ of the stop codon. V5 epitope is recognized by a mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). An XhoI restriction site was introduced after the stop codon for cloning purposes. The synthesized cDNA in pUC18 (Invitrogen) was digested by AviII (position 1954) and XhoI (after the stop codon) and ligated into the BMP-1 cDNA in pCEP4, hence forming the mTld-His cDNA clone. The rabbit polyclonal neoepitope antibody 1210 was raised against the first 10 amino acids of the metalloproteinase domain of BMP-1 (amino acids 121–130) (Sigma-Genosys) (34Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The full-length human chordin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF209928) (35Millet C. Lemaire P. Orsetti B. Guglielmi P. Francois V. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), cloned into the SpeI and EcoRI sites of a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), was first deleted of its 5′-noncoding region. For this, an SpeI-SfiI fragment was replaced by a small double-stranded oligonucleotide SpeI-SfiI DNA fragment containing the CAAA sequence as translation start site, flanked by a SpeI site and the ATG initiation codon. A c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) (36Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), recognized by antibody 9E10 (Roche Applied Science), was introduced in full-length human chordin between the putative signal peptidase cleavage site and CR1, 14 residues after the cleavage site (after amino acid 40). The SpeI-EcoRI c-Myc-tagged full-length chordin cDNA was then ligated to the NheI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this construct were shown to secrete the c-Myc-tagged chordin, which was demonstrated to antagonize bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 in a cell differentiation assay. 2V. François, D. Noël, C. Bony, C. Millet, M. Beaujoin, and C. Jorgensen, manuscript in preparation. The c-Myc-tagged chordin cDNA was then subcloned into the episomal expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) and used to transfect 293-EBNA cells as described below. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Deletion of the EGF-like domain 1 was as described (20Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ΔEGF1-BMP-1 clone was used to generate the His-tagged mTld-ΔEGF1 mutant, by excising and re-cloning the fragment comprising the deletion by BamHI (position 1390) and AviII (position 1954). For the deletion of the EGF-like domain 2 of mTld, NotI restriction enzyme sites were inserted at the borders of the EGF2 domain by PCR, using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) as described (20Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A two-step strategy was undertaken using the mTld tail in pUC18 as a template and the primers M13pUC18Forward (5′-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG) and E2NotaReverse (5′-ACTCGTCCTTGTCAGCGGCCGCTGAGAAGAAGT) on the one hand and E2NotbForward (5′-GAAGCCGGCGCGGCCGCTTGTGACCACAA) and pUC18DraIIReverse (5′-GGAGTAAAGGTCCTTGGTCTT) on the other hand. PCR products were purified, digested by XbaI (multicloning site of pUC18)/NotI, and NotI/MluNI (position 2494), respectively, and re-inserted into the mTld tail in pUC18. DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems) was used to verify the deletion and to ensure that the cDNA clones were error-free. The deleted EGF2 domain fragment in pUC18 was then digested by AviII (position 1954) and XhoI (after the stop codon) and inserted into mTld-His/pCEP4, thus generating mTld-ΔEGF2 mutant. The double mutant lacking EGF-like domains 1 and 2 (mTld-ΔEGF1 + 2 mutant) was obtained by cloning of the deleted EGF2 domain fragment into the mTld-ΔEGF1 clone. Protein Expression—293-EBNA (ECACC 85120602) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 0.25 mg/ml geneticin (G418, Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Four μg of wild-type or mutant plasmid/T25 were incubated with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and added to 293-EBNA cells in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours after transfection, media were removed and replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum for a further 24 h. The cells were trypsinized (Invitrogen) and diluted 1:5 for selection. After 48 h, selection was initiated by addition of 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Preparation of Media and Cell Lysates—Confluent cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking fetal calf serum for 24 h. Medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,600 × g to remove cell debris, and the pH was stabilized by the addition of a 1:10 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. For preparation of cell lysates, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with 500 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 15 min with occasional shaking. The cells were scraped on ice and sonicated. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Purification of the His6-tagged Enzymes—The cell medium (10 ml) with 0.01% Tween 20 was loaded onto a HIS-Select HC nickel affinity gel (Sigma). The His-tagged proteins were eluted in 0.01 m imidazole in a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.01% NaN3. Eluted fractions were analyzed by discontinuous SDS-PAGE (10% separating gel) and analyzed using the GelCode E-Zinc Reversible Stain kit (Pierce) (for mTld) or stained with silver nitrate (for BMP-1). Proteins were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm their identities. Where needed, the eluted proteins were concentrated using Microcon 50 (Amicon, Inc.) ultrafiltration devices. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Supernatants, cell lysates, or purified proteins (see above) were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) SDS-Prosieve gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications) under reducing conditions and subjected to Western immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used where appropriate: the mouse monoclonal anti-V5 linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Invitrogen); the mouse monoclonal 9E10 directed against the c-Myc tag followed by the secondary antibody (anti-mouse HRP conjugated IgG (Sigma)); and the rabbit polyclonal antibody 1210, directed against the active form of BMP-1/mTld, followed by the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit HRP conjugated IgG (Sigma)). The signal was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (SuperSignal West Dura extended duration, Pierce) in the case of the 1210 and c-Myc antibody, or by regular ECL (Amersham Biosciences) in the case of the V5 antibody. In experiments in which mTld and deletion mutants of mTld were assayed for proteolytic activity, we quantified the levels of the bands corresponding to the active form of the enzymes by laser densitometry of enhanced chemiluminescence fluorograms exposed to preflashed films. Native Gel Electrophoresis—The purified proteins were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min prior to electrophoresis. To the samples was added loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 0.0025% bromophenol blue, pH 8.6) in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2. The proteins were resolved on NOVEX 8% Tris-glycine pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) pre-run beforehand for 30 min in the electrophoresis buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3) containing or not 5 mm CaCl2. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, which was allowed to dry prior to immunoblotting as described above. Assay of Procollagen C-proteinase and Chordinase Activities—Purified BMP-1, BMP-1ΔEC3 mutant, mTld, and its EGF deletion mutants were assayed for procollagen C-proteinase activity using human U-l-14C-type I procollagen substrate (0.4 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.12 m NaCl, and 0.01% (w/v) Brij-35 in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C for 16 h. Where indicated, EDTA was added at a final concentration of 10 mm. Analysis of the cleavage products on SDS gels (7% separating; 3.5% stacking) was performed as described (34Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the cleaved products were visualized by exposing dried gels to a PhosphorImager plate (Fuji, type BAS III) in a PhosphorImager (Fujix BAS 2000). Proteins corresponding to the pro-α1(I) and pNα2(I) chains of type I procollagen and type I pNcollagen, respectively, were quantified using AIDA 2.0 software. The percent cleavage was calculated by multiplying the intensity of the pNα2(I), corrected for molecular mass, by the initial concentration of procollagen. Chordinase activity was determined in vitro by cleavage of c-Myc-tagged chordin in the same buffer as above, for 16 h at 37 °C, followed by analysis of the cleavage products on a 10% SDS-Prosieve gel and Western blot using 9E10 antibody as described above. When needed the nitrocellulose was stripped and reprobed with a different antibody. The mTld-ΔEGF Mutants Are Poorly Secreted from the Cells—To determine the contribution of each EGF-like domain of mTld to the enzymic activities of the molecule, we generated a series of deletion mutants that lacked each or both EGF-like domains, and we expressed the shortened proteinases in 293-EBNA cells (Fig. 1). NotI sites were introduced by PCR at the borders of the EGF domain of the cDNA clone, and restriction enzyme digestion was used to delete individual domains. Previous work showed that the NotI-derived alanine residues had no effect on the procollagen C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 when inserted at the domain junctions (20Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins contained a V5-peptide epitope at the C terminus to facilitate Western blot analysis. The culture media and cell lysates from the V5-tagged wild-type and mutant mTld were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) under reducing conditions, and Western blot analysis was performed using the anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2). Only the mature forms of the wild-type and the mutant proteins (indicated with a black circle) were present in the media, whereas cell lysates showed the presence of the latent forms (indicated with an asterisk). We noted the presence of faster migrating proteins that were immunoreactive to the V5 antibody. These proteins were presumably degradation fragments of mTld because they were absent from the empty vector control (Fig. 2, 1st and last lanes). Therefore, these degradation products were not considered during quantification of the active enzymes. The increased migration of the mutated mTld proteins was expected because of the deletion of ∼4.9 kDa per EGF-like domain from the polypeptide chain. Whereas wild-type and mutant proteins were equally well expressed (see Fig. 2, cell lysates), the deletion mutants mTld-ΔEGF1, mTld-ΔEGF2, mTld-ΔEGF1 + 2 were secreted less efficiently, representing 41 ± 14, 27 ± 8, and 32 ± 11% (n = 2) of mTld, respectively. The results showed that the EGF-like domains are required for efficient secretion of the molecule.Fig. 2Expression of wild-type and mutant mTld in 293-EBNA cells. Vectors containing cDNA-encoding wild-type and mutant mTld were expressed in 293-EBNA cells. When confluent, cells were rinsed and conditioned in serum-free medium for 24 h. Culture supernatants and cell lysates were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) under reducing conditions and detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-V5-HRP antibody. The proteins were secreted as mature forms (black circle).

To evaluate the contribution made by these domains to the calcium ion dependence of mTld and BMP-1, similar amounts of active purified V5His-tagged recombinant proteins were assayed for PCP activity by cleavage of 14C-labeled type I procollagen in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2. mTld, mTld-EGF deletion mutants, BMP-1, and the minimal C-proteinase (BMP-1ΔEC3) had negligible procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) activity in the absence of calcium ions (Fig. 3). As shown previously, BMP-1 and BMP-1ΔEC3 exhibited comparable PCP activity (∼75% of type I procollagen cleaved in 16 h at 37 °C) in the presence of calcium ions (Fig. 3B) (20Hartigan N.

For reasons that were unclear to us, the 1210 antibody was not always effective at detecting mTld in Western blots. Therefore, we could not be confident about comparing levels of mTld and BMP-1 during assays of the proteins. (The use of the anti-V5 antibody was effective in determining the relative concentrations of mTld and mutants of mTld. Likewise, the use of the 1210 antibody was effective in determining the relative concentration of BMP-1 and mutants of BMP-1.)

We show that ChAT is differentially phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms on four serines (Ser-440, Ser-346, Ser-347, and Ser-476) and one threonine (Thr-255). This phosphorylation is hierarchical, with phosphorylation at Ser-476 required for phosphorylation at other serines. Phosphorylation at some, but not all, sites regulates basal catalysis and activation. Ser-476 with Ser-440 and Ser-346/347 maintains basal ChAT activity. Ser-440 is targeted by Arg-442 for phosphorylation by PKC. Arg-442 is mutated spontaneously (R442H) in congenital myasthenic syndrome, rendering ChAT inactive and causing neuromuscular failure. This mutation eliminates phosphorylation of Ser-440, and Arg-442, not phosphorylation of Ser-440, appears primarily responsible for ChAT activity, with Ser-440 phosphorylation modulating catalysis. Finally, basal ChAT phosphorylation in neurons is mediated predominantly by PKC at Ser-476, with PKC activation increasing phosphorylation at Ser-440 and enhancing ChAT activity.

For example, chronic administration of nerve growth factor causes hypertrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons with increased ChAT mRNA and protein in aged rodents (5Higgins G.A. Koh S. Chen S.K. Gage F.H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 247-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and promotes recovery of cholinergic neurons following fimbriafornix lesions (6Koliatsos V.E.

Little is known, however, about mechanisms involved in short term regulation of ChAT function, with there being only a few reports of physiological perturbations that modulate its catalytic activity (7Pongrac J.L. Rylett R.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Tandon A. Bachoo M. Weldon P. Polosa C. Collier B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation is a common mechanism that regulates enzymatic activity, subcellular compartmentalization, or interaction of a protein with other cellular proteins. ChAT is a substrate for multiple kinases, with phosphorylation by some kinases regulating its activity (9Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of purified 69-kDa human ChAT by protein kinase C (PKC) increases its activity 2-fold; this increase is attenuated in mutant ChAT in which serine-440 is changed to an alanine residue (10Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22244-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ChAT at Ser-440 by PKC is also associated with altered membrane binding of the enzyme (10Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22244-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PKC comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases produced as isoenzymes that differ in mode of activation, substrate specificity (11Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 12Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Physiol. 2001; 281: H2062-H2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and subcellular compartmentalization. PKC isoforms fall into three main groups, conventional (cPKC: α, βI, βII, and γ), novel (nPKC: δ, ϵ, η, and θ), and atypical (aPKC: ζ and ι), defined by their structural homology and functional dependence on calcium, acidic phospholipids, and diacylglycerol (16Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 18Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The biological actions and regulation of PKC isoenzymes in neurons are not fully understood, but it is known that different isoenzymes mediate diverse cellular responses. This appears to be defined by different resting and stimulus-induced subcellular localization and translocation patterns for the isoenzymes and different target substrates based on the recognition of different optimal phosphorylation consensus sequences. Moreover, specific PKC isoenzyme expression and/or activity may be altered by pathology, including neurodegenerative diseases (19Battaini F. Pharmacol. Res. 2001; 44: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Most isoforms of PKC are found in brain where they are involved in regulation of a wide range of neuronal processes, including ion channel gating, receptor desensitization, neurotransmitter release, synaptic efficacy, and some forms of learning/memory (20Tanaka C. Nishizuka Y. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 551-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 21Le Merrer J. Nogues X. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 41: 503-514Google Scholar). Importantly, various PKC isoform levels and activities are increased or decreased differentially during neurodegeneration. These changes have been linked to processes involved in cellular repair, but more often they relate to advancing pathology and neuronal death (19Battaini F. Pharmacol. Res. 2001; 44: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated phosphorylation of 69-kDa human ChAT by a panel of PKC isoforms and identified differences in the patterns of phosphorylation. We determined that some residues that are phosphorylated by PKC are required for regulation of catalytic activity of ChAT, with selective mutation of these residues resulting in attenuation or complete loss of enzymatic activity. Thus, differential modulation of activity of PKC isoforms in response to physiological signals or in pathology could change or abolish ChAT activity and cholinergic neurotransmission. Plasmid Preparation and Protein Purification—The full-length cDNA encoding human 69-kDa ChAT (N1-ChAT) ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 was kindly provided by Dr. H. Misawa (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Japan). This was used for expression of the wild-type protein in eukaryotic cells and served as a template for preparation of mutant forms of the enzyme. To obtain stocks of purified recombinant ChAT, the protein was expressed in BL21/DE3 bacteria and purified by two different methods. Initially, ChAT was expressed in bacteria using the vector pPET3d and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (9Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, ChAT was captured by anti-ChAT antibody CTab covalently linked to Protein-G-Sepharose, then eluted from the column with buffer at pH 2.7 dropwise into Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0; this yielded purified ChAT in a solution with a final pH of 7.4 that could be stored at –80 °C until use. Subsequently, ChAT was expressed in bacteria as a hexahistidine-tagged (His6 tag) protein from the vector pProEx-HT (Invitrogen) that incorporates a tobacco-etch virus protease cleavage site between the epitope tag and ChAT. This epitope-tagged protein was purified from bacterial lysates on a nickel affinity column and eluted with buffer containing 50 mm imidazole according to the supplier's protocol. The His6 tag was cleaved from the amino terminus of ChAT by tobacco-etch virus protease (22Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Prot. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), then fractionated a second time on the nickel column to remove any ChAT protein still bearing the epitope tag. Mutagenesis of ChAT cDNA ligated into both eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The presence of Ser → Ala, Thr → Ala, and Ser → Glu mutations was verified at the nucleotide level by automated DNA sequencing and at the protein level by ESI-MS/MS sequencing. Cell Culture and Treatment—Human neuroblastoma IMR32 cells were transfected with plasmids containing wild-type or mutant 69-kDa human ChAT in pcDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 0.1% G418 in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To inhibit PKC, cell-permeable inhibitor, either 10 μm H7 or 10 μm epidermal growth factor receptor fragment 651–658 (Calbiochem) was added to the media 2 h before transfection. After 16 h following treatment, lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, leupeptin/aprotinin/pepstatin at 10/25/10 μg/ml, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 700 units/ml of DNase I) was added to the cell pellet, and cells were incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g for 10 min), and supernatants were used for analysis of activity. ChAT Activity Assay—ChAT specific activity was determined using a modification of the radioenzymatic assay of Fonnum (23Fonnum F. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), as published previously (24Rylett R.J. Goddard S. Lambros A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lysates of IMR32 cells expressing ChAT were prepared at a dilution that allowed measurement of enzyme activity under conditions conforming to initial rate kinetics. ACh Synthesis Assay—Conversion of [3H]choline to [3H]ACh was monitored in IMR32 cells transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant ChAT constructs and stably expressing human CHT1, as described previously (24Rylett R.J. Goddard S. Lambros A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Choline kinase required for this assay was partially purified as the hexahistidine-tagged protein from bacteria. The bacterial expression plasmid encoding choline kinase from Caenorhabditis elegans was produced by Dr. Daniel Peisach and was kindly provided by Drs. Patricia Gee and Claudia Kent (University of Michigan). Protein Phosphorylation and Analysis—Purified ChAT (0.5–2 μg/μl) was incubated with PKC isoenzymes α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ϵ, or ζ in a buffer comprising 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm glycerol-3-phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mg/ml 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycerol, 100 mg/ml phosphatidylserine. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped by adding electrophoresis sample buffer and heating the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min. Time course experiments were performed to measure incorporation of [32P]phosphate into wild-type ChAT (0.5 μg, 7.25 pm) by different isoforms of PKC (0.4 milliunit) for varying times in the presence of 2.5 nm [γ-32P]ATP. Proteins were separated on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were exposed to film at –80 °C for autoradiography, then processed for immunoblotting to monitor ChAT content in samples. Areas of the membranes corresponding to ChAT protein were excised, and incorporated [32P]phosphate was quantified by Cerenkov counting. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed on 7.5% separating gels according to the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (10% acetic acid and 50% methanol) or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting (transfer buffer: 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine containing 20% methanol). After transfer, membranes were saturated with 8% nonfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline, then probed with anti-ChAT CTab antibody (9Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, with primary antibody detected by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). In-gel Tryptic Digestion and Sample Preparation—After separation by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (gel thickness, 0.75 mm), proteins were stained briefly with Coomassie Blue and de-stained by washing over 3 h with at least five solvent changes (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) to ensure removal of SDS. After three washes with double-distilled water, bands corresponding to ChAT were excised from gels, reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. In-gel tryptic digestion was then carried out over 20 h, as described previously (26Dobransky T. Brewer D. Lajoie G. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5883-5893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping and Identification of Phosphorylated Residues—Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of ChAT were prepared as described previously (26Dobransky T. Brewer D. Lajoie G. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5883-5893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, following in-gel tryptic digestion of proteins, samples were applied to thin-layer cellulose (for thin-layer chromatography (TLC)) plates and electrophoresed in the first dimension in water/acetic acid/formic acid (89.7:7.8:2.5, v/v, pH 1.9) at 1000 V for 30 min. Plates were air-dried and developed in the second dimension in water/n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid (30:37.5:25:7.5, v/v). Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. For further analysis, phosphopeptides were eluted from the cellulose plates with water/acetonitrile (4:1, v/v), then reduced to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid. This solution of peptides was used directly for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. For ESI-MS/MS sequencing, phosphopeptides were purified on ZipTipC18TM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore) and eluted from the tip resin with 65% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid. One-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis (electrophoresis at pH 1.9 water/acetic acid/formic acid, 89.7:7.8:2.5, v/v; 1500 V; 25 min) was also performed on phosphopeptides eluted from cellulose plates or directly on mixtures of phosphopeptides recovered after in-gel tryptic digestion. Tryptic peptides were lyophilized, resuspended in 70 μl of 6 m HCl, boiled at 110 °C for 1 h, vacuum-dried at 45 °C, recovered in 2 μl of electrophoresis buffer, and spotted onto TLC plates. Mass Spectrometry—Phosphopeptides generated by phosphorylation of ChAT with PKC isoforms were recovered from cellulose plates by scraping into water/acetonitrile (4:1, v/v) solution and reduced to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. Recovery of [32P]phosphate-labeled peptides was monitored by Cerenkov counting and was >90%. Dry samples were reconstituted prior to mass spectrometry analysis in a solution composed of 2% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid or 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-MS was performed on Micromass MALDI-R and LR mass spectrometers using Masslynx 3.5 or 4.0 and operating in positive ion mode. Calibration was performed with a standard mixture of peptides (angiotensin I, renin substrate, and adrenocorticotrophic clip 18–39 (ACTH)). The sample in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was mixed 1:1 with a matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50:50 ACN:E-tOH). The adrenocorticotrophic clip 18–39 was also used as an external calibrant for all samples. Observed peptide spectra were processed using ProteinLynxGlobal Server 2.0. Alternatively, monoisotopic mass lists were generated and used to search the NCBI non-redundant data base using Mascot (www.matrixscience.com). NanoESI-LC-MS was performed on a Micromass Q-Tof2 or Micromass GLOBAL mass spectrometer using a standard analytical column configuration (0.5 × 5 mm C18, LC Packings plus 75-μm × 15-cm column, LC Packings). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a ten-port switching valve that allowed sample loading onto a precolumn (0.5 × 5 mm, LC Packings) at high flow rates (30 μl/min) followed by changing valve position for elution of the analyte from the precolumn to an analytical column (300 nl/min) that eluted directly through a nanoLC probe (Micromass) into the mass spectrometer. Solvents used were: A, 0.1% formic acid in water; B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile for sample elution; and C, 0.1% formic acid in high performance liquid chromatography grade water for sample loading. Peptides were eluted after a 3-min loading period using a linear gradient of 5–60% B over 32 min, 60–95% B over 5 min, 95% B for 10 min, 95–5% B over 5 min, and 5% B for 10 min. Instruments were calibrated using MS/MS spectra of Glu-fibrinopeptide-b. Experiments were carried out for the whole protein digest or for synthetic peptides. Species corresponding to expected m/z values of phosphorylated species were subjected to MS/MS. Data were processed with MaxEnt3 to obtain singly charged de-isotoped spectra. All sequences were manually verified using the PepSeq module accompanying MassLynx 4.0. Phosphorylation of ChAT by PKC Isoenzymes—Purified recombinant human 69-kDa ChAT is a substrate in vitro for each of seven PKC isoforms tested. However, phosphorylation of ChAT by different isoforms varies in both extent and pattern of phosphate addition with different amino acid residues utilized by some isoforms. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, phosphorylation of ChAT is greatest with cPKCγ and nPKCδ, intermediate with cPKCα, and least with cPKCβI, βII, nPKCϵ, and aPKCζ. In these experiments, [32P]phosphate incorporation into ChAT was quantification by Cerenkov counting of pieces of nitrocellulose membrane corresponding to ChAT protein after visualization by autoradiography (Fig. 1b, upper panel); data were normalized to immunoblots from the same membranes that verified equivalent amounts of ChAT protein (Fig. 1b, lower panel). To begin to investigate sites phosphorylated in ChAT by PKC, phosphorylation patterns were compared on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps. Taken together, two separate patterns were observed, one with cPKCs α, βI, βII, and γ and the other with nPKCs δ, ϵ, and aPKCζ. Representative phosphopeptide maps for cPKCα and nPKCδ are given in Fig. 2a. Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphopeptides eluted from TLC plates showed that ChAT is phosphorylated on serine and threonine by cPKC, but only on serine by nPKC and aPKC (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps reveal different serine/threonine phosphorylation patterns of ChAT by PKC isoforms. Purified bacterially expressed ChAT (3 μg) was incubated with PKC isoforms under phosphorylating conditions, then separated by SDS-PAGE. ChAT protein was subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion with the resulting peptides analyzed by phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid mapping. a, phosphopeptide maps of ChAT phosphorylated by cPKCα or nPKCδ; results obtained with cPKC βI, βII, and γ are identical to that shown for cPKCα, and those obtained with nPKCϵ and aPKCζ are essentially identical to that shown for nPKCδ. b, phosphopeptides present in the numbered spots on autoradiographs in Panel a were recovered for phosphoamino acid analysis. Phosphoserine is found in all spots except number 12. Phosphothreonine is present in spots 6 and 12 as phosphopeptides associated with these spots co-migrate and are separated only upon site-directed mutagenesis. These data are based on mobility of ninhydrin-stained authentic phosphoamino acids that were added to hydrolysates prior to electrophoresis. Data are representative of at least four (a) and three (b) separate experiments with each of the cPKC and nPKC/aPKC isoforms tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identification of Phosphorylated Residues—Based on analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) and mutagenesis, we identified four serine and one threonine residues in ChAT phosphorylated by various PKC isoenzymes. We found previously that Ser-440 is a PKC phosphorylation site (10Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22244-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we identified four new amino acid residues phosphorylated by PKC (Table I). Notably, purified ChAT is phosphorylated differentially by PKC isoforms in vitro, with cPKCs adding phosphate to Ser-346, Ser-347, Ser-440, Ser-476, and Thr-255, and nPKC and aPKC phosphorylating only Ser-440 and Ser-476. Moreover, based on mutagenesis (see below), this appears to comprise all of the PKC phosphorylation sites in purified ChAT incubated with PKC in vitro and for ChAT phosphorylated in situ in neuroblastoma cells either in the presence or absence of the PKC activator PMA. Additional residues that could be phosphorylated by PKC would have to be revealed by conformational rearrangement of the protein in response to perturbation(s) not apparent from the current experimental approaches; using the minimal PKC recognition sequence ((R/K)X(S*/T*) or (S*/T*)X(R/K)) (28Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), there are five more putative PKC phosphorylation sites in ChAT. All PKC phosphorylation sites identified in ChAT in this study correspond to (S*/T*)X(R/K); other optimal recognition motifs have been identified for different PKC isoforms in other substrate proteins (29Nishikawa K.

Open table in a new tab Phosphorylated residues were identified by MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS survey spectrum analyses; results from in-gel tryptic digests of purified ChAT phosphorylated by PKC isoforms are summarized in Table I. Four phosphopeptides were identified containing a total of four serine and one threonine residues as putative PKC phosphorylation sites. Liquid chromatography was required to separate isobaric peptides from phosphorylated ones to confidently identify phosphorylated sites. Phosphopeptides appeared to be low in abundance, making it difficult to obtain reliable sequence data. Moreover, sample handling had to be performed with extreme care; samples containing tryptic peptides were maintained in a dry state until analysis and could not be desalted using ZipTips due to peptide loss. To verify putative phosphorylation sites, peptides corresponding to the tryptic peptides identified were synthesized, incubated with PKC under phosphorylating conditions, and sequenced by tandem MS. This step was particularly important with one of the peptides identified by MS that contains two serine residues (HMTQS346S347RKLIR), both of which lie within putative PKC consensus sequences. MS and MS/MS analyses of this peptide are shown in Fig. 3. Under the conditions used, this peptide was highly phosphorylated at a single site with a small amount of doubly phosphorylated species observed (Fig. 3, a and b). MS/MS analysis of m/z 479.57 that corresponds to the triply charged, singly phosphorylated peptide clearly shows a y ion series that overwhelmingly supports Ser-346 as the major phosphorylation site (Fig. 3, c and d). In studies of which basic amino acid residues serve as determinants for optimal consensus sequences for PKC, arginine was found to be superior to lysine (31Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of PKC Isoenzyme-specific Phosphorylation Sites—Serine and threonine residues identified in ChAT as phosphorylation sites for PKC isoforms were mutated to dehydroalanine residues either singly or in combination. This allowed us to test their role in regulation of ChAT activity, confirmed the MS data, and gave insight whether there are additional phosphorylation sites not detected by MS. Representative phosphopeptide maps from tryptic digests of ChAT phosphorylated by cPKCα (Fig. 4a, upper panel) or nPKCδ (Fig. 4a, lower panel) demonstrate loss of 32P-labeled phosphopeptides associated with specific mutations.

https://openalex.org/W1969826507,"SAP is an adaptor molecule with one SH2 domain and it is expressed in activated T and NK cells, where it is required for the appropriate signaling from the SLAM family of surface receptors. Deleted or mutated SAP genes that encode functionally defective protein are associated with the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). This primary immunodeficiency is characterized by extreme sensitivity to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, dysgammaglobulinemia and a high rate of lymphoma development. The vigorous T- and B-cell proliferation that follows EBV infection and the high incidence of lymphomas (30%) in XLP patients might reflect functional defects in cell cycle and/ or apoptosis control. Our experiments show that SAP is a target of p53. In Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines transfected with a temperatur-sensitive (ts) p53, SAP mRNA and protein expression was dependent on wild-type (wt) p53. Activation of endogenous wt p53 in BLs and lymphoblastoid cell lines led to the induction of SAP and this was inhibited by the specific p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α. Cell lines that carried mutant p53 did not express SAP under similar conditions. Moreover, we have shown binding of wt p53 to the promoter region of SAP by ChIP assay. Our results suggest that SAP contributes to the execution of some p53 functions."

ATP and ATP analogs (ITP, 2′- and 3′-dATP) were used to study the effect of the adenine ring and the ribose hydroxyl groups on ATPase phosphorylation. All modifications of ATP altered conformational changes and phosphorylation kinetics. The differences compared with ATP increased in the following order: 3′-dATP > ITP > 2′-dATP. Enzyme phosphorylation with ITP results in larger absorbance changes in the amide I region, indicating larger conformational changes of the Ca2+-ATPase. The respective absorbance changes obtained with 3′-dATP are significantly different from the others with different band positions and amplitudes in the amide I region, indicating different conformational changes of the protein backbone. ATPase phosphorylation with 3′-dATP is also much (∼30 times) slower than with ATP. Our results indicate that modifications to functional groups of ATP (the ribose 2′- and 3′-OH and the amino group in the adenine ring) affect γ-phosphate transfer to the phosphorylation site of the Ca2+-ATPase by changing the extent of conformational change and the phosphorylation rate.

Here we investigate enzyme phosphorylation with ATP and ATP analogs inosine 5′-triphosphate (ITP) and 2′- and 3′-dATP to identify important functional groups of ATP for ATPase phosphorylation. The analogs differ from ATP at individual functional groups, which allows us to study the impact of these groups on the conformational change in the phosphorylation reaction (Ca2E1ATP → Ca2E1P). Photolabile derivatives, i.e. P3-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl nucleotides (caged nucleotides) (30Kaplan J.H. Forbush B. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), were used to trigger the protein reaction directly in the infrared cuvette in order to detect the small infrared absorbance changes associated with phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase. SR vesicles were prepared as described (31De Meis L. Hasselbach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4759-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 60-min dialysis of 50 μl of SR vesicles in 100 ml of dialysis buffer (10 mm methylimidazole/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 μm CaCl2, and 10 mm KCl), infrared samples were prepared by drying 15 μl of SR suspension on a CaF2 window with a trough of 5-μm depth and 8-mm diameter and immediately rehydrating with ∼0.8 μl of H2O. The sample was sealed with a second flat CaF2 window. The approximate sample composition based on 1 μl of sample volume is 1.2 mm Ca2+-ATPase, 0.5 mg/ml Ca2+ ionophore (A23187), 150 mm methylimidazole, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml adenylate kinase (except for ITP samples), and 10 mm caged nucleotide. Adenylate kinase, which regenerates ATP (2ADP → AMP + ATP), was added in samples with caged ATP and caged dATPs in order to repeat the kinetic experiments with one sample up to two times (12Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Samples with caged ATP or caged 2′-dATP were also made in the absence of adenylate kinase for comparison. 10 mm Ca2+ was used instead of the physiological co-substrate Mg2+ to block the Ca2E1P → E2P transition in order to achieve a maximum level of Ca2E1P in the steady state after nucleotide release while slowing down the phosphorylation reaction (12Barth A. von Germar F.

Apyrase (A6535 from Sigma) at low concentration (2 mg/ml) was used in some samples with caged ATP or caged ADP in the presence/absence of ATPase. Apyrase liberates inorganic phosphate from ATP and ADP: ATP → ADP + Pi → AMP + 2Pi. In the presence of ATPase apyrase consumes the ADP generated upon ATP hydrolysis. This leads to accumulation of the Ca2E1P state without bound ADP. Although the affinity of ATPase to ATP is very high, apyrase should be used at low concentrations to avoid or slow down its reaction with ATP. Experiments in the absence of ATPase were done as control. Control experiments with fluorescein isothiocyanate (35Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), thapsigargin (29Liu M. Barth A. Biophys.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were performed, and it was confirmed that the infrared signals observed in our difference spectra were induced by reactions between nucleotide and the Ca2+-ATPase. FTIR Measurements—Time-resolved FTIR measurements of the Ca2+-ATPase reaction were performed at 1 °C as described (12Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Liu M. Barth A. Biophys.

Photolytic release of nucleotides from the respective caged derivatives was triggered by a Xenon flash tube (N-185C, Xenon Corp., Woburn MA) for ATP and dATP or by a XeCl excimer laser for ITP (21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The number of photolysis flashes needed for saturating signals was determined as described (21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Data were acquired as shown in Fig. 1. A reference spectrum was first recorded with the protein in the Ca2E1 state; after applying the photolysis flash(es), we recorded time-resolved infrared spectra with 65-ms time resolution from 0 to 225 s or longer. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the reference spectrum from the spectra recorded after nucleotide release. They reflect absorbance changes due to nucleotide binding and ATPase phosphorylation as well as the photolysis reaction under our experimental conditions. Groups or structures not involved in the reactions do not manifest in the difference spectra. Kinetic Evaluation of Nucleotide Binding and Phosphorylation Reaction—The time constants of nucleotide binding (tb), ATPase phosphorylation (tp), and nucleotide hydrolysis were obtained by fitting the integrated band intensities of the marker bands at 1628 and 1641 cm–1 for nucleotide binding, at 1718, 1657, and 1549 cm–1 (at 1722 and 1707 cm–1 for 3′-dATP) for phosphorylation, and at 1241 cm–1 for nucleotide hydrolysis as described (12Barth A. von Germar F.

Calculation of Nucleotide Binding, Ca2E1P Formation, and Phosphorylation Spectra—Nucleotide binding spectra show absorbance changes associated with the reaction Ca2E1 → Ca2E1NTP, and Ca2E1P formation spectra show those associated with Ca2E1 → Ca2E1P. The time constants of tb and tp were used to determine the time intervals used to calculate the nucleotide binding spectra (ΔtNB) and Ca2E1P formation spectra (ΔtE1P) as listed in Table I. We chose the time interval starting at 3tb and ending at half of tp for each nucleotide to calculate binding spectra. For obtaining Ca2E1P formation spectra, we chose time intervals starting at 3tp and ending at 68.1 s for ATP, ITP, and 2′-dATP, and for 3′-dATP ending at 224 s.Table IParameters of spectra recordingNucleotideNo. of experiments/no. of samplesConcentration of nucleotide/no. of flashTime interval of nucleotide binding ΔtNB/Ca2E1P formation ΔtE1PATP23/123 mm/1 flash0.46-0.90/5.84-68.1 s2′-dATP8/43 mm/1 flash0.46-3.24/21.4-68.1 sITP4/46.6 mm/3 flashes0.72-3.32/26.7-68.1 s3′-dATP3/33 mm/1 flash0.46-3.24/165-224.4 sATP (no ADK)4/43 mm/1 flash0.10-0.33/5.84-68.1 s Open table in a new tab By subtracting the nucleotide binding spectrum from the Ca2E1P formation spectrum, we obtained the phosphorylation spectrum showing the absorbance changes in the phosphorylation reaction (Ca2E1NTP → Ca2E1P) as shown in Fig. 1. Phosphorylation spectra show the spectral differences between the two time intervals, ΔtNB and ΔtE1P. Photolysis signals do not appear in phosphorylation spectra because they are identical in the nucleotide binding and the Ca2E1P formation spectrum and are thus subtracted. Difference spectra were normalized to a standard protein concentration (amide II absorbance 0.26) before averaging spectra from different samples to avoid the possible predominance of individual samples with high protein content in the averaged difference spectra, as described (29Liu M.

The number of averaged experiments and the amount of released nucleotides with different flash times are listed in Table I. Phosphorylation with ATP—The phosphorylation spectrum obtained with ATP is shown in Fig. 2A (see also Table II). It reflects infrared absorbance changes in the reaction Ca2E1ATP → Ca2E1P. This spectrum is in agreement with those observed before (12Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol.

The 1241 cm–1 band is due to a loss of one PO–2 group upon ATP splitting,Adenosine-O-PO2−-PO2−-PO32−→adenosine-O-PO2−-PO32−+Pi(or Ca2ElP) This band has been assigned to the antisymmetric stretching mode (νas) of the PO–2 of bound nucleotide (36Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The smaller amplitude observed in the phosphorylation spectrum with ATP (Fig. 2) is due to the presence of adenylate kinase, which regenerates ATP. Phosphorylation with 2′-dATP and ITP—Phosphorylation spectra obtained with 2′-dATP and with ITP are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Double difference spectra in Fig. 2C show the difference between the phosphorylation spectrum obtained with 2′-dATP or ITP and that with ATP. We termed them extra conformational change spectra obtained with 2′-dATP or ITP as explained later. In Fig. 2A, the phosphorylation spectrum with 2′-dATP shows signals similar to that with ATP except for the bands at ∼1643, 1241, and 1115 cm–1. The difference at ∼1643 cm–1 in the amide I region is possibly due to different conformational changes of β-sheets during phosphorylation. In the presence of adenylate kinase, the 1241 cm–1 band obtained with ATP is smaller than that obtained with 2′-dATP as shown in Fig. 2A. However, with ATP in the absence of adenylate kinase, this band shows the same integrated band intensity and kinetic change as with 2′-dATP in the presence of adenylate kinase. Thus, we attribute the difference between ATP and 2′-dATP in the presence of adenylate kinase to faster regeneration of ATP from ADP as compared with that of 2′-dATP from 2′-dADP. Samples with 2′-dATP in the absence of adenylate kinase were made to investigate this further, and we observed no difference (data not shown) compared with 2′-dATP samples in the presence of adenylate kinase. Adenylate kinase was recently found to use ADP more efficiently than 2′-dADP (37Resnick S.M. Zehnder A.J.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 2045-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). But in an earlier study the efficiency was very similar for ADP and 2′-dADP (38Ladner W.E. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1985; 50: 1076-1079Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here our observation agrees with the most recent result (37Resnick S.M. Zehnder A.J.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 2045-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). With ITP (no adenylate kinase present), the band amplitude at 1241 cm–1 (Fig. 2B) is similar to that in the phosphorylation spectrum obtained with ATP in the absence of adenylate kinase. As shown in Fig. 2B the phosphorylation spectrum obtained with ITP is significantly different from those obtained with ATP and with 2′-dATP. The differences compared with ATP are particularly pronounced in the amide I region. Larger band amplitudes indicate that larger conformational changes occur when ITP phosphorylates the ATPase. Bands at 1696, 1642, and 1621 cm–1 in the amide I region of the phosphorylation spectrum obtained with ITP are different from those with ATP. They indicate different conformational changes of β-sheets or turns in the phosphorylation reaction with ITP. In the following we will explore the characteristics of this extra conformational change upon phosphorylation with ITP. A spectrum of the extra conformational change is shown in Fig. 2C. This spectrum was calculated by subtracting the phosphorylation spectrum obtained with ATP from that obtained with ITP. In Fig. 3A this spectrum is compared with the spectra of ATP and ITP binding. As the figure shows, the extra conformational change spectrum with ITP is very similar in shape to the nucleotide binding spectra. A similar shape indicates a similar character of the conformational change, i.e. that secondary structure elements are perturbed in a similar manner. This indicates that conformational changes characteristic of ATP binding take place during phosphorylation with ITP. The band amplitudes in the extra conformational change spectrum are between those of ITP binding and ATP binding. This indicates that the extent of the extra conformational change is larger than that of ITP binding but smaller than that of ATP binding. Fig. 3A also shows that the extent of conformational change upon ITP binding is only about 30% that of ATP binding (21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as judged from the amplitude of the main bands. Because we can expect that the initial state in our samples is the same for all nucleotides, the different amplitudes in the binding spectra indicate a different structure of the nucleotide ATPase complexes as shown previously (21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, if the extra conformational change spectrum with ITP is added to the ITP binding spectrum, the resulting spectrum has ∼70% of the amplitude of the ATP binding spectrum (as judged from the band amplitudes of the two largest bands). This comparison is shown in Fig. 3B. The generated spectrum is in fact very similar in shape and amplitude to the 2′-dATP binding spectrum (21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which has about two times larger band amplitudes than the ITP binding spectrum. This indicates that if the extra conformational change upon phosphorylation with ITP had taken place already upon ITP binding, the structure of the ITP ATPase complex would be very similar to that obtained with 2′-dATP and more similar to that with ATP than actually observed. The consequence of the extra conformational change upon phosphorylation with ITP is that the conformation of Ca2E1P obtained with ITP becomes more similar to that obtained with ATP in comparison to the nucleotide ATPase complexes with ITP and ATP. This is evident from the relatively similar band amplitudes of the Ca2E1P formation spectra with ITP and ATP (see Fig. 3C and Ref. 21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as compared with the large amplitude differences in the nucleotide binding spectra (see Fig. 3A and Ref. 21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Ca2E1P formation spectrum with ITP is very similar to that obtained with 2′-dATP (21Liu M. Barth A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation with 3′-dATP—Absorption changes after 3′-dATP binding were also observed as shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum obtained with 3′-dATP differs from the other phosphorylation spectra (Fig. 2) in that it shows different band positions and amplitudes for most of the bands. The spectrum with 3′-dATP does not show the marker band for phosphorylation at 1718 cm–1 observed with ATP and other ATP analogs. Instead, there are two bands at 1722 and 1707 cm–1. The bands at 1674, 1643, and 1533 cm–1 in the amide I region indicate that conformational changes occurred after binding. A band characteristic of ATP splitting is also observed at 1241 cm–1 with 3′-dATP. Despite the differences to the other phosphorylation spectra, we tentatively attribute this spectrum with 3′-dATP to phosphorylation of the ATPase for the following reasons. (i) It is known that 3′-dATP can phosphorylate the ATPase, although to a lower extent compared with ATP (39Coan C. Amaral J.A. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) there are bands at 1722 and 1707 cm–1 close to the marker band of phosphorylation at 1718 cm–1; (iii) the conformational changes after 3′-dATP binding are accompanied by 3′-dATP consumption as indicated by the negative band at 1241 cm–1, which exhibits the same slow kinetic change as the band at 1722 cm–1 (Fig. 5). The absorbance changes after 3′-dATP binding are very slow; reaction kinetics of the bands at 1722, 1707, and 1241 cm–1 observed with 3′-dATP (t = 52, 61, and 55 s, respectively) were ∼30-fold slower than those with ATP (tp = 2 s). The time course of these bands is shown in Fig. 5. The absorption changes are only partly complete during the measuring time of our experiments. The difference spectrum shown in Fig. 4 was obtained by subtracting the 3′-dATP binding spectrum from the spectrum averaged from 165.4 to 224 s. This spectrum shows ∼80% of the absorbance changes associated with the complete reaction (calculated from the fitting of the bands at 1722 and 1707 cm–1). Kinetics of the Conformational Change—Kinetic evaluation of the bands at 1657 or 1643 cm–1 in the amide I region and at 1547 or 1533 cm–1 in the amide II region (data not shown) give the time constants of the conformational change of the protein backbone. For all nucleotides the time constants are the same as those of the marker band for enzyme phosphorylation at 1718 cm–1 (at 1722 cm–1 for 3′-dATP). The 1718 cm–1 b"

In the present report we have described a novel calcium entry pathway that is independent of depletion of intracellular calcium stores. Treatment of the cells with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (caly A), which blocked thapsigargin-evoked store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), induced a potent concentration-dependent calcium entry. In a calcium-free buffer, acute addition of caly A evoked a very modest increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i). This increase was not from the agonist-mobilizable calcium stores, as the thapsigargin-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i was unaltered in caly A-treated cells. The caly A-evoked calcium entry was not blocked by Gd3+ or 2-APB, whereas SOCE was. Caly A enhanced the entry of barium, indicating that the increase in intracellular calcium was not the result of a decreased extrusion of calcium from the cytosol. Jasplakinolide and cytochalasin D had only marginal effects on calcium entry. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 and an inhibitory peptide for PKA abolished the caly A-evoked entry of both calcium and barium. The SOCE was, however, enhanced in cells treated with H-89. In cells grown in the absence of thyrotropin (TSH), the caly A-evoked entry of calcium was smaller compared with cells grown in TSH-containing buffer. Stimulation of cells grown without TSH with forskolin or TSH restored the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry to that seen in cells grown in TSH-containing buffer. SOCE was decreased in these cells. Our results thus suggest that TSH, through the production of cAMP and activation of PKA, regulates a calcium entry pathway in thyroid cells. The pathway is distinctly different from the SOCE. As TSH is the main regulator of thyroid cells, we suggest that the novel calcium entry pathway participates in the regulation of basal calcium levels in thyroid cells.

As TSH is the main regulator of thyroid cells, we suggest that the novel calcium entry pathway participates in the regulation of basal calcium levels in thyroid cells. Calcium is the key regulator of a multitude of cellular processes, including proliferation, gene transcription, and apoptosis (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). To enable such a broad spectrum of different actions, the cells have evolved a plethora of different mechanisms regulating cellular calcium levels. Calcium may be mobilized from intracellular compartments by the activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI14–22, inhibitory peptide for PKA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; [Ca2+]i, cytosolic calcium concentration; SOCE, store-operated calcium entry; TRP channels, transient receptor potential channels; TSH, thyrotropin;. receptors or ryanodine receptors. Furthermore, calcium may enter the cells through a multitude of calcium channels, both voltage-dependent and -independent channels. Ca2+ ATPases in both the plasma membrane and in intracellular membranes participate in regulation by transporting calcium out of the cell or into intracellular compartments. In non-excitable cells, calcium entry is usually evoked as a result of agonist-mediated activation of the phospholipase C-IP3 pathway, mobilization of sequestered calcium from intracellular stores, and, as a consequence of this depletion, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Calcium entry can also be the result of agonist-evoked activation of receptor channels (i.e. the P2X receptors for ATP) or the activation of non-selective cation channels (i.e. second-messenger channels and stretch-activated channels). Of these different calcium entry pathways, the activation of store-operated calcium channels has attracted substantial interest (2Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.-J. Lievremont J.-P. St. J. Bird G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. Nat. Rev. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition, several investigations show that agonist-evoked calcium entry (e.g. as seen in calcium oscillations) is mediated through a distinct, arachidonic acid-regulated calcium channel (4Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Shuttleworth T.J. Mignen O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The SOCE, also called the capacitative calcium entry, is the direct result of depletion of intracellular calcium stores. The emptying of the stores evoked a profound entry of calcium into the cytosol from the extracellular space, through mechanisms not yet fully understood. Three theories are presently at hand. First, the emptying of intracellular stores produced a factor that diffuses to the plasma membrane and opens calcium channels. Second, emptying of the calcium stores causes the fusion of vesicles containing calcium channels with the plasma membrane. In the last model, the depletion of calcium stores causes a conformational coupling of the IP3 receptor with calcium channels (2Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.-J. Lievremont J.-P. St. J. Bird G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. Nat. Rev. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Very convincing evidence has been obtained in support of the conformational coupling theory, e.g. the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton potently abrogates store-operated calcium entry (6Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Rosado J.A. Porras T. Conde M. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15666-15675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the disruption and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton would physically hinder a coupling between the IP3 receptor and calcium channels located on the plasma membrane. However, evidence obtained in several investigations has provided support for all three mechanisms. The situation is not made easier to fathom considering the wealth of different types of calcium channels (in particular the TRP family of channels) (8Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar) that have been suggested to mediate, at least in part, store-operated calcium entry. In thyroid FRTL-5 cells, changes in intracellular calcium control several processes, including the regulation of iodide efflux (9Weiss S.J. Philp N.J. Grollman E.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1108-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Corda D. Marocci R. Kohn L.D. Axelrod J. Luini A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 166: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Ekokoski E. Webb T.E. Simon J. Törnquist K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in intracellular calcium may modify the TSH-evoked effects in thyroid cells (9Weiss S.J. Philp N.J. Grollman E.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1108-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Okajima F. Sho K. Kondo Y. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to agonist-evoked changes in [Ca2+]i (15Törnquist K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the SOCE pathway is probably an important regulator of intracellular calcium signaling (16Törnquist K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments aimed at further understanding the mechanisms regulating calcium entry, we observed that the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, a potent disrupter of the actin cytoskeleton, abolished SOCE in our cells. However, in those experiments we observed that the resting calcium levels were higher compared with that seen in control cells. Further investigations revealed that calyculin A evoked a substantial calcium entry that was distinct from the SOCE. Furthermore, the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry appeared to be crucially dependent on cAMP and PKA. As the cAMP-PKA pathway is a major regulator of thyroid cell function, we suggest that the calcium entry mechanism we have described in the present investigation is of importance in regulating calcium levels in thyroid cells.

All other chemicals used were of reagent grade. Bovine TSH was a generous gift from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cell Culture—Rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells, originally obtained from the Interthyr Foundation (Bethesda, MD), were grown in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and six hormones (6H) (17Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prior to an experiment, cells from one donor culture dish were harvested with a 0.2% trypsin solution and plated onto plastic 100-mm culture dishes. The cells were the grown for 7–8 days, incorporating 2–3 changes of culture medium with the final medium change 24 h prior to an experiment. In some experiments the cells were grown in 5H medium (i.e. medium lacking TSH) for 5 days prior to an experiment. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—The medium was aspirated, and the cells were harvested with HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS, in millimolar concentrations: NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.6; glucose, 10; CaCl2, 1.0; HEPES, 20, pH 7.4) lacking Ca2+ but containing 0.02% EDTA and 0.1% trypsin. After washing the cells three times by pelleting, the cells were incubated with 1 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the loading period, the cells were washed twice with HBSS buffer, incubated for at least 15 min at room temperature, and washed once more. Fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi F2000 fluorimeter using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and detecting emission at 510 nm. The signal was calibrated by the addition of 1 mm CaCl2 and Triton X-100 to obtain maximum fluorescence. The chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with 5 mm EGTA and the addition of Tris base to elevate the pH above 8.3 were both used to obtain minimum fluorescence. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenia M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using a computer program designed for the fluorimeter with a Kd value of 224 nm for Fura 2. For the experiments, calyculin A and the used inhibitors were applied as a dimethyl sulfoxide solution. The concentration of the solute never exceeded 0.2%, and in the control experiments the solvent alone was used. Calcium Imaging Experiments—Cells from one 100-mm cell culture dish were harvested using 0.02% EDTA-0.1% trypsin solution and plated onto polylysine-coated round coverslips. After 2–4 days of culture, the cells were incubated with Fura-2/AM (final concentration 4 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. Following the loading period, the cells were incubated for at least 20 min to ensure complete cleavage of the AM group from Fura-2. After washing the cells once, the coverslip was mounted on an Axiovert 35 inverted microscope with a Fluor ×40 objective and perfused with HBSS. The excitation filters were set at 340 and 380 nm, and the excitation light was obtained using an XBO 75W/2 xenon lamp. Emission was measured at 510 nm. The shutter was controlled by a Lambda 10–2 control device (Sutter Instruments, No-vato, CA). Fluorescence images were collected with a SensiCam 12BIT CCD camera (PCO/CD Imaging, Kelheim, Germany). The experiments were performed at room temperature. Images were taken every 2.6 s to avoid bleaching. The system was calibrated using Ca2+-free HBSS containing Fura-2 (potassium salt). 1 mm Ca2+ was added to obtain the Rmax solution and 1 mm EGTA for the Rmin solution. The program Axon Imaging Workbench automatically calculated [Ca2+]i according to Grynkiewics et al. (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenia M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using Kd = 224 for Fura-2. Confocal Microscopy of Actin Filaments—The cells were grown as described above. Cells from a 100-mm culture dish were harvested as described for the calcium measurements and plated onto poly(d)lysine-coated coverslips. The cells were cultured for 48 h with a change of culture medium after 24 h. The cells were stimulated with 100 nm calyculin A for 15 and 30 min. Control cells were treated with vehicle only. The coverslips were then washed twice with warm (+37 °C) PBS. The fixation of the cells was made by incubating the coverslips for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature, after which the cells were washed twice with PBS. The cells were permeabilized for 3–5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and washed twice with warm PBS. Prior to the staining, the cells were incubated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (300 units; Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:40 with PBS-bovine serum albumin, and the cells were incubated with the solution for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with warm PBS. The cells were examined using a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope equipped with an Argon-Krypton laser (Omnichrome, Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and the emission wavelength was 500–540 nm. Pictures were taken using a PL APO ×40/1.25–0.75 oil objective. All figures were acquired with Leica TCS NT software. Measurement of Cellular cAMP Levels—The cells were harvested as described for the calcium experiments and were preincubated in HBSS for 20 min in the presence of 0.3 mm isobutylmethylxantin (to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity). Then aliquots of cells (0.5 × 106 cells/tube) were stimulated with 100 nm calyculin A. After 15 min the reaction was stopped with perchloric acid to a final concentration of 0.5 m. The samples were neutralized by KOH, and the cAMP concentrations were determined using a protein binding method (19Norstedt C. Fredholm B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Measurements of the EM—The studies were performed using the patch clamp whole-cell technique in voltage and current clamp mode (20Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar). Prior to the experiments, cells were harvested with 0.02% EDTA-trypsin solution and subcultured on coverslips on 24-well plates (BD PharMingen) for 2–5 days. The coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber. During recordings the cells were continuously perfused with a standard solution containing (in mm): NaCl, 150; KCl, 5.4; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1.8; HEPES, 5 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) at 0.5 ml/min. Calyculin A (100 nm) was added to the superfusate from a stock solution of 100 μm. Patch pipettes were made from GC150TF glass micropipettes (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK) and had a resistance of 2–5 MΩ (when filled with an internal solution containing (in mm): KCl, 150; MgCl2, 2; BAPTA, 5; HEPES, 10 (pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). All recordings were made at room temperature. Currents were recorded with an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Analyses of the recordings were made using Pulse and Pulse Fit software (HEKA). Statistics—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was made using Student's t test for paired observations. When three or more means were tested, analysis of variance was used. Calcium Entry Mechanisms in FRTL-5 Cells—Previous studies have shown that FRTL-5 cells respond to depletion of intracellular calcium stores with a substantial entry of calcium (16Törnquist K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that the thapsigargin-evoked depletion of calcium stores results in entry of exogenous calcium and that this entry can be blocked by 30 μm 2-APB, 1 μm Gd3+ and by pretreatment of the cells with 100 nm of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (Fig. 1, A and B). We observed that the basal calcium level of cells treated with calyculin A always was higher than in control cells (218 ± 5nm and 126 ± 5 in calyculin-treated and control cells, respectively, n = 6, p <0.05, see Fig. 1A). To investigate the reason for this, we stimulated FRTL-5 cells with calyculin A and observed a distinct increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2A). This increase was not blocked by either 30 μm 2-APB or 1 μm Gd3+ (Fig. 2B). The results thus suggest that, in FRTL-5 cells, calyculin A evokes an increase in [Ca2+]i that does not occur through store-operated calcium channels. Calyculin A per se evoked a very modest increase in [Ca2+]i in cells in a calcium-free buffer (22 ± 5 nm, n = 4). However, calyculin A did not mobilize calcium from IP3-dependent stores, as the thapsigargin-evoked release of sequestered calcium in a calcium-free buffer was 151 ± 27 nm in calyculin A-treated cells and 148 ± 9 nm in control cells, respectively. To further investigate the effect of calyculin A, we pretreated the cells with calyculin A and suspended the cells in a calcium-free buffer. Then calcium (final concentration 1 mm) was added back to the cells. In these experiments, we observed an increase in [Ca2+]i that was dependent on the concentration of calyculin A (Fig. 2, C and D). The increase in [Ca2+]i was insensitive to both 2-APB and Gd3+ (Fig. 2E). In contrast to this observation, if FRTL-5 cells were stimulated with 1 μm thapsigargin and calcium was then readded, the calcium entry was potently abrogated by 2-APB and Gd3+ (Fig. 3A). However, if cells treated with 100 nm calyculin A were stimulated with 1 μm thapsigargin in a calcium-free buffer and calcium was readded, we always obtained a substantial entry of calcium. The initial calcium entry was indistinguishable from that seen in cells stimulated with thapsigargin only (867 ± 91 nm and 817 ± 69 nm in thapsigargin- and calyculin A-treated cells, respectively; Fig. 3B). The increase in [Ca2+]i then slowly declined to a plateau level lower than that seen in cells stimulated with thapsigargin only. The new plateau level of [Ca2+]i was 495 ± 35 nm in control cells and 349 ± 32 nm in calyculin A-treated cells (p <0.05, Fig. 3B). The increase in [Ca2+]i probably is a combination of the calyculin-evoked calcium entry and a small residual store-operated calcium entry due to the thapsigargin-evoked depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores. A comparison of the increase in [Ca2+]i obtained after addition of calcium to cells treated with calyculin only, or with both calyculin and thapsigargin, is shown in Fig. 3D. To investigate the effect of calyculin A on the actin cytoskeleton in our cells, we labeled control cells and cells treated with 100 nm calyculin with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin. As can be seen in Fig. 4, treatment of the cells resulted in a dramatic reconstruction of the actin filaments in the cells. The effect of calyculin A in our cells was very similar to that observed in other cell types (see Refs. 6Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and 7Rosado J.A. Porras T. Conde M. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15666-15675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and thus probably explains why the thapsigargin-evoked SOCE was attenuated in our cells after treatment with calyculin A. To ensure that calyculin A actually enhanced calcium entry and not increased [Ca2+]i by blocking plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases and calcium extrusion, we measured the entry of Ba2+ in calyculin A-stimulated cells. In these experiments pretreatment with calyculin A clearly enhanced Ba2+ entry (Fig. 5A). For comparison, the thapsigargin-evoked Ba2+ entry is shown (Fig. 5B). The results in Fig. 5 show that the calyculin A-evoked Ba2+ entry (49 ± 3 fluorescense units/30 s) is more pronounced than the thapsigargin-evoked Ba2+ entry (31 ± 4 fluorescense units/30 s; p <0.05). Furthermore, both calyculin A and thapsigargin enhanced the entry of Sr2+ (results not shown). Mechanisms of Calyculin A-evoked Calcium Entry—Calyculin A could theoretically enhance calcium entry by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential, thus increasing the electrochemical driving force for calcium. However, in patch clamp experiments in the current clamp mode, we could not show an effect of calyculin A on the membrane potential compared with vehicle-treated cells. The change in EM in control cells was –5.6 ± 3.6 mV, compared with –7.7 ± 0.8 mV in cells treated with 100 nm calyculin A as measured over a time span of 6 min. Calyculin A potently redistributes the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. To test whether the effects of calyculin A were the result of this redistribution, we treated our cells with either jasplakinolide (3 μm for 60 min) or cytochalasin D (5 μm for 30 min). Addition of calcium to cells treated with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D evoked a transient increase in [Ca2+]i (248 ± 66 and 225 ± 12 nm, respectively) that was not significantly different from that seen in control cells (184 ± 17 nm). We also tested whether cyclosporin, an inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, could mimic the effect of calyculin A. However, incubating the cells with cyclosporin (1 μg/ml for 15 min) did not enhance calcium entry (data not shown). We have previously shown that protein kinase C can potently modulate calcium entry in FRTL-5 cells (16Törnquist K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pretreating the cells with either calphostin C (100 nm) or GF109203X (10 μm) for 15 min did not attenuate the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry (data not shown). In addition, stimulating calyculin A-pretreated cells with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not increase the calcium entry compared with control cells treated with calyculin A only (data not shown). However, when the cells were pretreated with the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10 μm for 15 min) or with PKI14–22 (10 μm for 30 min), both the calyculin A-evoked calcium and barium entry were abolished (Fig. 6, A–C). In sharp contrast to this, we observed that the thapsigargin-evoked calcium entry was enhanced in the presence of 10 μm H-89 (Fig. 6D). To further test the hypothesis that PKA was involved in regulating the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry, we cultured our cells in medium lacking TSH. The calyculin A-evoked calcium entry was significantly reduced in the cells (334 ± 31 nm) compared with cells grown in the presence of TSH (571 ± 47 nm, p <0.05). If TSH-depleted cells were stimulated with a low dose of forskolin (0.1 μm), the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry was enhanced significantly (507 ± 39 nm, p <0.05) compared with TSH-depleted control cells. Furthermore, if the cells were stimulated with 0.3 milliunits of TSH, the calyculin A-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i (702 ± 60 nm) was significantly (p <0.05) increased compared with TSH-depleted control cells (Fig. 7, B and C). Thus, both forskolin and TSH restored the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry to the same level as seen in cells grown in the presence of 0.3 milliunits of TSH. To investigate whether a direct activation of PKA without prior treatment with calyculin A could enhance calcium entry in TSH-depleted cells, we stimulated cells with 10 μm forskolin and calcium. As can be seen in Fig. 7D, forskolin evoked an entry of calcium (150 ± 7 nm) that was significantly smaller in cells pretreated with 10 μm H-89 (109 ± 2 nm, p <0.05). We next investigated whether calyculin A increased cellular cAMP levels in FRTL-5 cells. The concentration of cAMP in cells stimulated with 100 nm calyculin A for 15 min was 4.7 ± 0.5 pg/0.5 × 106 cells (n = 4), compared with 6.3 ± 1.0 pg/0.5 × 106 (n = 4, p >0.05) in vehicle-treated control cells. Thus, the effect of calyculin A was downstream from the production of cAMP in the cells, suggesting that the effect of calyculin A was the result of an enhanced phosphorylation by PKA. For comparison, the thapsigargin-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i was also measured in TSH-depleted cells. Our results show that the thapsigargin-evoked SOCE was enhanced in cells grown in the absence of TSH compared with cells stimulated with 0.3 mm TSH (Fig. 7, E and F). Thus, an increase in cAMP has an antagonizing effect on SOCE in FRTL-5 cells. We also wanted to investigate whether calcium entry evoked by G protein-coupled receptors could be enhanced by treatment with calyculin A. When cells were pretreated with 100 nm calyculin A for 15 min, the calcium signal evoked by 100 μm ATP was clearly broadened (Fig. 8). The decrease in [Ca2+]i was 36 ± 5nm/10 s at 75% of the downward part of the calcium transient, whereas the value was 65 ± 10 nm/10 s in control cells (p <0.05). Similar results were obtained in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml for 24 h, results not shown). Furthermore, H-89 attenuated the ATP-evoked calcium signal in calyculin A-treated cells (decrease in [Ca2+]i was ≫ 100 nm/10 s). All experiments were performed in the presence of 1 μm Gd3+ to block SOCE. Next we tested whether the ATP-evoked calcium signal in cells not treated with calyculin A was composed of a component dependent on PKA. This seems to be the case, as PKI14–22 altered the ATP-evoked calcium spike (decrease in [Ca2+]i was 114 ± 19 nm/10 s, p <0.05; Fig. 8). Thus, the novel calcium entry pathway also seems to be involved in calcium signaling through G protein-coupled receptors. Effect of Calyculin A on [Ca2+]i in Single Cells—As the above experiments were performed with cells in suspension, we wanted to investigate whether calyculin A also enhanced calcium entry in single cells. As can be seen in Fig. 9, pretreatment of single cells with 100 nm calyculin A for 15 min enhanced calcium entry compared with the entry obtained in control cells. The effect of calyculin A was not altered by the presence of 1 μm Gd3+, whereas the thapsigargin-evoked calcium entry was decreased (data not shown) in a manner similar to that observed in cells in suspension. In the present investigation we have shown that, in addition to store-operated calcium entry (16Törnquist K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), thyroid FRTL-5 cells also have a previously unknown calcium entry pathway. This calcium entry pathway seems to depend on the activation of PKA. The novel entry pathway is distinctly different from the SOCE pathway. We have based our conclusion on the following observations. Store-operated calcium entry was almost totally blocked by preincubating the cells with calyculin A, whereas the novel calcium entry pathway was revealed by inhibition of phosphatases with calyculin A. The increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by calyculin A was the result of calcium entry, not a decreased extrusion of calcium, as calyculin A potently enhanced the entry of Ba2+, a poor substrate for the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase. The store-operated Ba2+ entry was of smaller magnitude in comparison with the calyculin-evoked Ba2+ entry. SOCE was abrogated by 2-APB and a low concentration of Gd3+, whereas the calyculin A-evoked entry was not. Finally, the PKA inhibitors H-89 and PKI14–22 blocked the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry, whereas H-89 enhanced SOCE. In addition, in cells grown without TSH, the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry was enhanced by the addition of TSH, whereas TSH decreased the SOCE. The entry of calcium upon depletion of calcium stores has been explained by conformational coupling of the IP3 receptor with plasma membrane calcium channels. Evidence suggests that these channels belong to the TRP family of channel proteins (possibly the TRPC3, Refs. 22Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 23Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence for conformational coupling has been obtained in experiments where calyculin A-evoked formation of cortical actin layers inhibited calcium entry (6Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 24Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3963-3967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275Google Scholar). However, this effect was considered mainly a function of the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, as jasplakinolide also inhibited store-operated calcium entry. Experiments performed with cytochalasin D, another agent forming cortical actin, resulted in similar results. The present calcium entry pathway, on the other hand, is not attenuated after calyculin A-evoked cortical actin formation. Thus, our results strongly point at an effect mediated by an inhibition of a phosphatase, as treatment of the cells with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D did not evoke a response similar to that obtained by calyculin A. Furthermore, the calcium entry was not the result of store depletion, as calyculin A did not modify agonist-evoked store depletion. Thus, the present calcium entry is probably not the result of a coupling of intracellular stores to calcium channels in the plasma membrane. We suggest that the inhibition of a phosphatase uncouples a block of a calcium entry pathway. Previous studies have shown that a phosphatase is involved in regulating SOCE. The very first studies on SOCE showed that emptying of intracellular stores evoked a highly calcium-selective current (calcium release-activated current, ICRAC) (26Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 27Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stuhme W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The activation of this current involved a phosphatase (27Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stuhme W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In another study it was shown that the effect of a presently unknown calcium influx factor was enhanced by inhibition of phosphatases by okadaic acid (28Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Other investigations have shown that calyculin A or methavanadate enhances a SOCE-like current in outside-out patches in rabbit portal vein smooth muscle cells, a current similar to that evoked by phorbol esters or diacylglycerol (29Ma R. Pluznick J. Kudlacek P. Sansom S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25759-25765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Albert A.P. Large W.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This calcium entry is probably mediated by a member of the TRP family of channel proteins as diacylglycerol has been shown to directly activate TRPC3 and TRPC6 channels (31Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of phosphatases enhanced protein kinase C-evoked activation of SOCE in inside-out patches (29Ma R. Pluznick J. Kudlacek P. Sansom S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25759-25765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle cells, inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin prevented the calcium-evoked inhibition of L-type voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) cells (32Schuhmann C. Romain C. Baumgartner W. Groschner K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and inhibition of phosphatases increased VOCC currents in pancreatic β-cells (33Larsson O. Barker C.J. Sjöholm Å. Catqvist H. Michell R.H. Bertorello A. Nilsson T. Honkanen R.E. Mayr G.W. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Science. 1997; 278: 471Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Phosphatases thus seem to have an important role in regulating ion channels and are often excised together with ion channels (34Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, in a study by Lalevée et al. (35Lalevée N. Resin V. Arnaudeau S. Demaurex N. Rossier M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), pretreatment of cells with calyculin A was without any effects on either angiotensin II- or high potassium-evoked calcium signals. The calcium entry mechanism described is probably also distinct from the arachidonic acid-evoked calcium entry pathway. Arachidonic acid-evoked calcium entry has been implicated in regulating calcium entry during calcium oscillations evoked by low concentrations of agonists (36Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gd3+ or 2-APB did not block the arachidonic acid-evoked calcium entry (37Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10174-10181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In FRTL-5 cells, arachidonic acid evoked calcium entry (38Törnquist K. Ekokoski E. Forss L. Matsson M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but the magnitude was modest compared with that seen in the present investigation. In addition, arachidonic acid depleted intracellular calcium stores (38Törnquist K. Ekokoski E. Forss L. Matsson M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Presently no information exists regarding the sensitivity of the arachidonic acid-evoked calcium entry to calyculin A. However, the arachidonic acid-evoked current was inhibited by calcineurin (39Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40088-40096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas we were unable to evoke any calcium entry by treating the cells with cyclosporin A. Trebak et al. (40Trebak M. St. J. Bird G. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) have shown that low concentrations of Gd3+ did not block receptor-activated HTRPC and 2-APB had only a weak effect. Thus, we cannot exclude that treatment of our cells with calyculin A reveals calcium entry through a calcium channel of the TRP family of channels. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some (e.g. autocrine) form of receptor-mediated activation of calcium entry may occur after treatment with calyculin A. This is unlikely, as previous studies in FRTL-5 cells have shown that cAMP blocked the coupling of G protein-coupled receptors to at least phospolipase C (21Laglia G. Zeiger M.A. Leipricht A. Caturegli P. Levine M.A. Kohn L.D. Saji M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3170-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We did, however, observe that activation of G protein-coupled receptors evoked calcium signals that, in part, were mediated by the novel entry mechanism. These calcium signals could further be enhanced by calyculin A and were blocked by both H-89 and PKI14–22. Our results thus point at a rather complex calcium signaling pattern in response to agonists activating G protein-coupled receptors as ATP also evokes SOCE in FRTL-5 cells (15Törnquist K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A very interesting observation was that the calcium entry appeared to be dependent on the cAMP-PKA pathway: if PKA were blocked by H-89 or PKI14–22, the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry was blocked. Furthermore, in cells grown in the absence of TSH, the calyculin A-evoked calcium entry was of lower magnitude compared with cells grown in the presence of TSH. Addition of TSH or forskolin to cells grown in TSH-free medium rapidly enhanced calcium entry in cells treated with calyculin, suggesting that phosphorylation of a channel protein (or an accessory protein) by PKA is involved in regulating calcium entry. In sharp contrast to this observation, we showed that the thapsigargin-evoked calcium entry was attenuated by cAMP in cells grown in TSH-free medium. A similar cAMP-evoked inhibition of store-operated calcium entry has been shown in platelets (7Rosado J.A. Porras T. Conde M. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15666-15675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The TSH-cAMP-PKA pathway is one of the most important regulators of thyroid cell function. It is tempting to suggest that the calcium entry mechanism revealed in the present investigation participates in the regulation of basal calcium levels in thyroid cells. This regulation probably is under strict control of PKA and a presently unknown phosphatase. Furthermore, the entry pathway is clearly distinct from store-operated calcium entry. Apparently G protein-coupled receptors also may utilize this calcium entry pathway. Further investigations will reveal whether a complex interplay exists between store-operated calcium entry and the novel cAMP-dependent calcium entry.

Although mutational variants of c-Abl can exhibit gain of function and can produce a transformed phenotype, the function of c-Abl in transformation remained unclear. Here, we report that the loss of c-abl facilitates transformation. c-abl-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) immortalized by SV40 T antigen acquired anchorage-independent growth, and by constructing mutational variants of T antigen we showed that binding of large T antigen to p53 and RB was necessary to induce anchorage-independent growth. Although c-abl/p53 double-knockout MEFs did not undergo anchorage-independent growth, those expressing human papilloma virus 16 E7, which mainly inactivates RB, did. Our results show that the loss of c-abl facilitates anchorage-independent growth in the context of p53 and RB deficiency, and suggest that loss of function of c-abl facilitates some types of transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2160052005,"The mechanism by which the neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, mediates homophilic interactions between cells has been variously attributed to an isologous interaction of the third immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, to reciprocal binding of the two N-terminal Ig domains, or to reciprocal interactions of all five Ig domains. Here, we have used a panel of recombinant proteins in a bead binding assay, as well as transfected and primary cells, to clarify the molecular mechanism of N-CAM homophilic binding. The entire extracellular region of N-CAM mediated bead aggregation in a concentration- and temperature-dependent manner. Interactions of the N-terminal Ig domains, Ig1 and Ig2, were essential for bead binding, based on deletion and mutation experiments and on antibody inhibition studies. These findings were largely in accord with aggregation experiments using transfected L cells or primary chick brain cells. Additionally, maximal binding was dependent on the integrity of the intramolecular domain-domain interactions throughout the extracellular region. We propose that these interactions maintain the relative orientation of each domain in an optimal configuration for binding. Our results suggest that the role of Ig3 in homophilic binding is largely structural. Several Ig3-specific reagents failed to affect N-CAM binding on beads or on cells, while an inhibitory effect of an Ig3-specific monoclonal antibody is probably due to perturbations at the Ig2-Ig3 boundary. Thus, it appears that reciprocal interactions between Ig1 and Ig2 are necessary and sufficient for N-CAM homophilic binding, but that maximal binding requires the quaternary structure of the extracellular region defined by intramolecular domain-domain interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2070917671,"The rhadinovirus herpesvirus saimiri transforms human T lymphocytes to stable growth in culture. Besides the viral oncogenes stpC and tip, little is understood about the transformation process at the cellular level. To identify cellular factors that might contribute to growth transformation, we compared cellular gene expression in pairs of herpesvirus saimiri-transformed and nontransformed human T-cell clones. Using cDNA arrays and suppressive subtractive hybridization, we were able to identify the chemokine CCL1/I-309 as one of the few cellular genes that are strongly overexpressed in T cells after growth transformation with herpesvirus saimiri. The transformed T cells expressed CCR8, the receptor for CCL1, which rapidly induced intracellular calcium ion levels. Neutralizing antibodies to CCL1 led to reduced secretion of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α as well as to reduced proliferation rates in transformed T cells. Thus, we propose that growth transformation of human T cells with herpesvirus saimiri gives rise to an autocrine loop where the proliferation of transformed T cells is supported by the endogenous production of the chemokine CCL1."

Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). TGs are widely distributed in various organisms. In mammals, nine distinct but closely related transglutaminases, have been identified, namely TGs 1–7, coagulation factor XIIIa, and the catalytically inactive band 4.2 (1Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Homologues have been found in invertebrates as well as in slime molds, plants, and bacteria. A phylogenetic analysis of all the TGs indicated that an early gene duplication event might have given rise to two lineages, i.e. one that comprises TG2, TG3, TG5, TG6, TG7, and erythrocyte band 4.2, and the other that consists of fXIIIa, TG1, TG4, and invertebrate TGs (2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Among the TG family members, TG2, TG3, TG5, and slime mold TG (3Wada F. Nakamura A. Masutani T. Ikura K. Maki M. Hitomi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3451-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have been shown to be regulated by guanine nucleotides. TG2 is involved in several biological processes such as cell adhesion, apoptosis, and wound healing (4Melino G. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Piredda L. Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Piacentini M.

Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar); it has also been shown to be capable of functioning as a signal-transducing GTP-binding protein coupled to activated receptors (6Iismaa S.E.

The x-ray structure of human TG2 bound with GDP is known, the main GDP-binding residues have been identified (8Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and binding constants for the nucleotides have been measured (9Murthy S.N. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, it has been shown through biochemical evidence that TG3 and TG5 are able to hydrolyze GTP, and structural data show that the putative GTP-binding pocket is conserved between TG2, TG3, and TG5 (10Ahvazi B.

TG cDNAs have been isolated from lower vertebrates such as fish, and the genes have been found to share structural similarity with that of mammalian genes (12Sano K. Nakanishi K. Nakamura N.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 1957-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), have also been cloned, but the physiological roles of these invertebrate TGs remain unclear. Previous results obtained by Cariello et al. (21Cariello L. Velasco P.T. Wilson J. Parameswaran K.N. Karush F. Lorand L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Cariello L. Wilson J. Lorand L.

Commun. 1994; 205: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that TG or TGs might be involved at various stages in the embryonic development of the sea urchin. Although these reports described the identification and purification of sea urchin TG activity, no structural information has been presented. To find out more about invertebrate TGs, their physiological roles, and their evolutionary relationship to other TGs, we attempted the molecular cloning of a Paracentrotus lividus TG (PlTG). In this study a cDNA clone encoding PlTG was isolated, and its expression pattern was analyzed by in situ hybridization. By biochemical characterization of in vitro expressed PlTG, we demonstrated that this enzyme showed a calcium-dependent transamidating activity that was negatively regulated by guanine nucleotides. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PlTG was able to hydrolyze GTP and ATP, although there is a low sequence homology with the GTP-binding domain of TG2. PlTG is the first transglutaminase characterized from an invertebrate organism that displays ATP- and GTP-hydrolyzing activity. Animals and Embryos—Adult specimens of P. lividus were collected in the Bay of Naples. Specimens were shed by KCl (0,5 m) injection, and gametes were collected in filtered sea water. Eggs were fertilized with suspensions of sperm and cultured at 18 °C. When the embryos reached the appropriate stage they were packed by hand centrifugation, frozen at –20 °C for RNA preparation, or fixed for in situ hybridization. Materials and Reagents—Sodium salts of ATP and GTP were of the highest quality available and were purchased from Sigma. Tetralithium salt of GTP-γ-S was purchased from Sigma. Guinea pig liver TG2 was obtained from Sigma. [1,4-14C]Putrescine dihydrochloride (114 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP (25 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]GTP (25 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Activated charcoal was purchased from Sigma. Enzymes were purchased from Promega Biotech or New England Biolabs unless stated otherwise. Probe Preparation—Poly(A)+ RNA from the gastrula stage of the sea urchin P. lividus was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript preamplification system for first strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen) and then amplified directly using PCR according to manufacturer's instructions. The following degenerate primers were used to amplify the coding region of the active-site of a putative sea urchin TG: 5′-GTSMMVTAYGGMCAGTGCTGGGT-3′ and 5′-ARRTCHGGYCKSKYCATCCA-3′, where H = A or C or T; K = G or T; M = A or C; R = A or G; S = C or G; V = A or C or G; and Y = C or T. The 232-bp reaction product containing the coding sequence of the TG active site was used as the sea urchin TG probe. cDNA Library Construction and Screening—cDNA was synthesized with 4 μg of blastula stage poly(A)+ RNA. After the addition of EcoRI adapters, the cDNA was inserted into the vector arms of λZAP II (24Aniello F. Locascio A. Fucci L. Geraci G. Branno M. Gene. 1996; 178: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This ligated DNA was encapsidated using Gigapack II Gold packaging extract according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) and used to infect the Escherichia coli strain XL-1 blue, thus constructing a cDNA library. Approximately 9 × 105 recombinant λ phages were screened by plaque hybridization using the sea urchin TG cDNA probe labeled by random priming (Multiprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was carried out at 60 °C for 16 h in Church buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaHPO4, and 7% SDS). Subsequently, the filters were washed three times for 10 min each at room temperature in 2× standard saline citrate (SSC) and 0.1% SDS and twice for 20 min at 60 °C in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The cDNA inserts from positive clones were rescued as pBluescript SK(-) by helper phage-mediated in vivo excision as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). DNA Sequencing and Analyses—Ten positive cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced. All sequences were carried out with a CEQ 2000XL DNA analysis system apparatus (Beckman) by Molecular Biology Service of Stazione Zoologica “Anton Dohrn”, Naples, Italy. The DNA and amino acid sequences were analyzed using the GCG computer program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package). Three of the positive clones contained the entire sequence of the sea urchin TG cDNA. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out according to Arenas-Mena et al. (25Arenas-Mena C. Cameron A.R. Davidson E.H. Development. 2000; 127: 4631-4643PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Full-length cDNA was cloned in the pBluescript SK(-). The plasmid was digest with SpeI and used as template for in vitro transcription by using the Roche digoxygenin RNA labeling kit according to the supplier's instruction and stored in H2O at –80 °C. Embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 m MOPS, pH 7.5, at 4 °C over night. The embryos were then incubated in hybridization buffer containing 0.1 ng/μl digoxigenin-labeled antisense transcript. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 1 week. After hybridization, samples were washed five times in MOPS buffer at room temperature to remove the probe, incubated for an additional 3 h under hybridization conditions, and washed three more times with MOPS buffer. The samples were incubated with 1:1500 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Fab fragments (Roche Applied Science) overnight at room temperature. The antibody was removed with five washes in MOPS buffer over an interval >24 h. After washes with AP buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm levamisole; 30 min each) signal detection was performed in AP buffer containing 4.5 μl/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 3.5 μl/ml 5-bromo-4-choro-3-indolylphosphate. The reaction was stopped by dilution in MOPS buffer. Plasmid Construction—A polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the PlTG cDNA for subcloning as a GST fusion protein into the E. coli expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length PlTG cDNA was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase and two primers containing an EcoRI restriction site. The amplification product was digested with EcoRI and cloned in-frame with GST into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2T. Restriction digests identified inserts in the correct orientation, and DNA sequence analysis verified that no errors had been introduced during the PCR reaction. A Cys-324 → Ala mutant expression vector of PlTG cDNA (GST·PlTGC324A) was generated using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega) and GST·PlTG as the template following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutation was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—A single colony of E. coli cells (BL21-CodonPlus) containing the recombinant pGEX plasmid (pGEX-PlTG or pGEX-PlTGC324A) was inoculated in 100 ml of Luria-Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The culture was diluted 1:10 into fresh Luria-Bertani medium and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7–0.8. Expression of the two GST fusion proteins was induced overnight at 22 °C with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell pellets were sonicated in 20 ml/liter cell culture of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After centrifugation (32,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatant fraction was mixed at room temperature with 1 ml/liter cell culture of glutathione-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 150 mm NaCl. The matrix was packed into a 1× 10-cm column and washed with 30 bed volumes of buffer A. GST fusion proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm reduced glutathione and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The GST tag was not removed, because previous work from many groups has indicated this is unnecessary (26Zwerschke W. Rottjakob H.W. Kuntzel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23351-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Koropchak C.M. Haroon Z.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31191-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto a Immobilon-P membrane and detected with anti-GST horseradish peroxidase conjugated (1:1500 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). Reactivity was visualized by an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Transglutaminase Activity—TG activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [14C]putrescine into N,N′-dimethylcasein (28Lorand L. Campbell-Wilkes L.K. Cooperstein L. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 50: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A 80-μl reaction mixture containing 16 pmol of purified GST, GST fusion proteins, or guinea pig liver TG2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0,7% N,N′-dimethylcasein, 400 μCi of [14C]putrescine, and 4 mm CaCl2 (or indicated amounts) was incubated at 37 °C. At 10, 30, and 60 min, 10 μl of reaction mixture were spotted on Whatman 3M filters and immediately washed with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 20 min, 3× ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min, 3× acetone-ethanol (1:1 v/v) for 5 min, and 1× acetone for 5 min (5 ml per filter). Filters were dried, and incorporated radioactivity was counted in 5 ml of Omnifluor. Reaction blanks contained no added calcium. Inhibition assays contained 0–1.5 mm GTP-γ-S in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2. GTPase and ATPase Activity—GTPase and ATPase activities were determined by the charcoal method as described (29Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson Jr., M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A 50-μl reaction containing 10 pmol of purified GST, GST fusion proteins, or guinea pig liver TG2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 7.2 μm GTP (or ATP), and 0.8 μm [γ-32P]GTP (or [γ-32P]ATP) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction blanks contained no added enzyme. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 750 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) activated charcoal in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, and centrifuged (12,000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C), and the amount of [32P]Pi released was determined by scintillation counting of 400 μl of the supernatant. For inhibition assays, GST fusion proteins were preincubated with or without GTP-γ-S for 30 min on ice before the addition of a substrate to start the reaction. For determination of the kinetic constant, Km, and Vmax, the concentrations of GTP were varied from 1 to 10 μm. Kinetic analysis of the data was performed by the Eadie-Hofstee method. Cloning of PlTG cDNA—To characterize sea urchin TG, we screened a P. lividus blastula stage cDNA library using a partial cDNA fragment of sea urchin transglutaminase as a probe. The probe cDNA was obtained by PCR on gastrula stage RNA using two degenerate oligonucleotides encoding the conserved amino acid sequence around the active site of TGs. Ten positive clones were isolated from the 9 × 105 clones screened and sequenced, and three of them included the entire nucleotide sequence of P. lividus TG cDNA, PlTG, including a putative initiation codon. The full-length cDNA of PlTG was 5398-bp long and contained a 103-bp noncoding region at the 5′-end and an extension of ∼3000 bp at the 3′-end of the noncoding region. One polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) and a poly(A) tail were observed in the 3′-untranslated region. The complete sequence showed an open reading frame of 2316 bp, corresponding to a protein of 738 amino acids with a molecular mass of 82,890 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence included Cys-324, two other residues critical for transamidating activity (His-383 and Asp-406), and the tryptophan residue that is a general feature of catalysis in all eukaryotic TGs present in position 289 (30Iismaa S.E. Holman S. Wouters M.A. Lorand L. Graham R.M. Husain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12636-12641Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A putative Ca2+ binding region (Val-481—Arg-503), which has been identified in human TG2, was also found (Fig. 1) (31Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We aligned the PlTG amino acid sequence with other TGs with respect to the middle region around the active site and Ca2+-binding region, which are highly homologous among many TGs. The amino acid sequence of PlTG in this region was ∼40% identical to those of human TG2, TG3, and TG5 as well as crayfish, ascidian, grasshopper, fruit fly, limulus, slime mold, and shrimp TGs, whereas for starfish TG the identity was ∼60% (Fig. 2). PlTG showed the presence of a long aminoterminal region, common to all invertebrate TGs, that is missing in the human enzymes. In the phylogenetic tree of transglutaminase presented by Lorand and Graham, PlTG was situated closer to other invertebrate TGs than to human and fish TGs. Among human TGs, however, TG4 was placed significantly close to invertebrate TGs (2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). To check whether PlTG showed the presence of a putative GTP-binding region, we performed a sequence alignment of transglutaminases in the region where the key residues for TG2, TG3, and TG5 interactions with GTP have been described following a mutagenesis approach (6Iismaa S.E. Wu M.J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and x-ray studies (8Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Ahvazi B. Boeshans K.M. Idler W. Baxa U. Steinert P.M. Rastinejad F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7180-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Among the key residues interacting with GTP in TG2, Ser-171, Arg-476, and Arg-478 are conservatively replaced by Thr-226, Lys-530, and Lys-633, respectively, in PlTG; but Phe-174 and Arg-478 are non-conservatively replaced by Asn-229 and Val-532 (Fig. 2). PlTG Spatial Expression—Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis was used to define the spatial expression pattern of PlTG mRNA during embryogenesis. During the cleavage stage, PlTG expression was ubiquitous (until the 64-cell stage). Starting from early blastula stage, in addition to ubiquitous expression the transcript became concentrated in the interior region of the blastoderm. At the mesenchyme blastula stage PlTG was expressed in a dynamic fashion in the vegetal plate of the embryo in the region where the presumptive endoderm and ectoderm interact. No staining was observed within the central region of the vegetal plate (endodermal territory), and in the primary mesenchyme cells localized, at this stage, in the blastocoel. Gastrula stage embryos revealed a similar pattern in that the PlTG expression was maintained around the vegetal plate of the embryo. The circumferential expression pattern of PlTG around the involuting archenteron is quite striking. As gastrulation proceeded and the archenteron involuted progressively further into the embryo, PlTG expression remained localized to a rather constant region lateral to the blastopore opening. A second domain of PlTG expression appeared in the animal hemisphere at the late gastrula stage in the oral ectoderm. In particular, a signal became evident in the region where the mesenchyme cells contact through the philopods, the animal ectoderm. By the prism stage the PlTG transcript appeared in the oral ectoderm, with the highest level detectable in the ciliary band ectoderm associated with the growing arm buds. This signal remained constant during the pluteus stage (Fig. 3). E. coli Expression of Wild Type and Mutant PlTG—To study biochemical activity of PlTG, we carried out expression in E. coli of full-length sea urchin transglutaminase. The coding region of sea urchin TG cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with GST into a plasmid vector, pGEX2T, to construct a pGEX2T-PlTG expression vector. A mutated form of PlTG in which the active site Cys-324 was point-mutated to an Ala was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis on pGEX2T-PlTG (pGEX2T-SUTGC324A). The expression vectors were introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus strains (Stratagene) engineered to contain extra copies of genes that encode the tRNAs that most frequently limit the translation of heterologous recombinant proteins in E. coli. The resulting GST fusion proteins were named GST·PlTG and GST·PlTGC324A. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After sonication and centrifugation, the resulting supernatant fractions were loaded on glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns. After 30 bed volumes of column washing, GST fusion proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione. The fusion proteins migrated at their predicted molecular mass upon SDS-PAGE. Average yields per liter of culture medium were 100 μg of wild type, 50 μg of mutant PlTG, and 10 mg of 26-kDa GST (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-GST antibody showed reactivity of both proteins. Additional minor bands, including the 26-kDa GST that reacted with the polyclonal anti-GST antibody, are most likely proteolytic fragments derived from fusion protein breakdown (Fig. 4B). TG Activity of GST·PlTG Fusion Protein—The TG activity of GST·PlTG wild-type and mutated fusion proteins was investigated using the incorporation of 14C-putrescine into N,N′-dimethylcasein as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” GST·PlTG was a functionally active TG, showing an increase of transglutaminase activity dependent on protein concentration (data not shown). GST·PlTG activity was comparable with that of commercially available guinea pig liver TG2 (Fig. 5). As expected, mutation of the active Cys resulted in no TG activity for the GST·PlTGC324A mutant (Fig. 5). The activity of GST·PlTG was completely dependent on the presence of calcium, increasing with increasing Ca2+ concentrations, giving 50% activity with 1 mm Ca2+, and reaching the maximum activity with 4 mm Ca2+ under the assay conditions used (data not shown). Purified GST, used as control, had no detectable transglutaminase activity (Fig. 5). The nucleotide GTP has been shown to inhibit type 2 (such as guinea pig liver TG), type 3, and type 5 transglutaminase activity. In contrast, the transglutaminase activity of other TGs, such as that from Limulus hemocyte, was not affected by GTP even at millimolar concentrations. To study the effect of GTP on GST·PlTG transglutaminase activity we carried out an inhibitory assay using a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, GTP-γ-S, at different concentrations. Concentrations of GTP-γ-S, in the millimolar range had a detrimental effect on GST·PlTG activity, and the degree of inhibition was different depending on calcium concentration. Using 1 mm GTP-γ-S, 60% inhibition was obtained in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6). Complete inhibition of GST·PlTG occurred with 1.5 mm GTP-γ-S in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+ concentration. The inhibitory effect caused by GTP-γ-S could be reversed by increasing the concentration of calcium up to 2 mm (data not shown). GTPase and ATPase Activity of GST·PlTG Fusion Proteins— Not all residues implicated in GTP binding in TG2 are conserved in PlTG. However, the recent finding of a GTPase activity in TG3, which was believed to lack such an activity on the basis of the sequence similarity, encouraged us to test to determine whether the PlTG is able to bind and hydrolyze ATP and GTP. Incubation of PlTG and the mutated form PlTGC324 with [γ-32P]GTP or [γ-32P]ATP resulted in the release of [32P]phosphate. The release was linear up to 45 min with time. These results indicate that GST·PlTG fusion proteins have GTPase and ATPase activity. When spontaneous GTP and ATP hydrolysis was discounted, a net GTPase activity of 71.51 ± 6.9 fmol/pmol of GST·PlTG per minute was calculated compared with 163.67 ± 28.18 fmol/pmol GST·PlTGC324A per minute and 9 fmol/pmol for guinea pig liver TG2 per minute (Fig. 7A). A net ATPase activity of 131.71 ± 14.9 fmol/pmol GST·PlTG per minute calculated compared with 143.67 ± 15.7 fmol/pmol GST·PlTGC324A per minute and 8.55 fmol/pmol for guinea pig liver TG2 per minute (Fig. 7B). The GTPase activity was dependent on protein concentration (data not shown) and substrate concentration. The effect of the increasing GTP concentration on the rates of GTP hydrolysis revealed an apparent Km of 10 μm for the GST·PlTG fusion protein that was in the range of the Km for human erythrocyte TG2 (14 μm) (32Fraij B.M.
