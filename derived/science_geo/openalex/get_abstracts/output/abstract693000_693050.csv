https://openalex.org/W4229004838,"The prevailing view of metazoan gene regulation is that individual genes are independently regulated by their own dedicated sets of transcriptional enhancers. Past studies have reported long-range gene-gene associations1-3, but their functional importance in regulating transcription remains unclear. Here we used quantitative single-cell live imaging methods to provide a demonstration of co-dependent transcriptional dynamics of genes separated by large genomic distances in living Drosophila embryos. We find extensive physical and functional associations of distant paralogous genes, including co-regulation by shared enhancers and co-transcriptional initiation over distances of nearly 250 kilobases. Regulatory interconnectivity depends on promoter-proximal tethering elements, and perturbations in these elements uncouple transcription and alter the bursting dynamics of distant genes, suggesting a role of genome topology in the formation and stability of co-transcriptional hubs. Transcriptional coupling is detected throughout the fly genome and encompasses a broad spectrum of conserved developmental processes, suggesting a general strategy for long-range integration of gene activity."

https://openalex.org/W4229080677,"A globally invasive form of the mosquito Aedes aegypti specializes in biting humans, making it an efficient disease vector1. Host-seeking female mosquitoes strongly prefer human odour over the odour of animals2,3, but exactly how they distinguish between the two is not known. Vertebrate odours are complex blends of volatile chemicals with many shared components4-7, making discrimination an interesting sensory coding challenge. Here we show that human and animal odours evoke activity in distinct combinations of olfactory glomeruli within the Ae. aegypti antennal lobe. One glomerulus in particular is strongly activated by human odour but responds weakly, or not at all, to animal odour. This human-sensitive glomerulus is selectively tuned to the long-chain aldehydes decanal and undecanal, which we show are consistently enriched in human odour and which probably originate from unique human skin lipids. Using synthetic blends, we further demonstrate that signalling in the human-sensitive glomerulus significantly enhances long-range host-seeking behaviour in a wind tunnel, recapitulating preference for human over animal odours. Our research suggests that animal brains may distil complex odour stimuli of innate biological relevance into simple neural codes and reveals targets for the design of next-generation mosquito-control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4229007424,"Abstract Oestradiol establishes neural sex differences in many vertebrates 1–3 and modulates mood, behaviour and energy balance in adulthood 4–8 . In the canonical pathway, oestradiol exerts its effects through the transcription factor oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) 9 . Although ERα has been extensively characterized in breast cancer, the neuronal targets of ERα, and their involvement in brain sex differences, remain largely unknown. Here we generate a comprehensive map of genomic ERα-binding sites in a sexually dimorphic neural circuit that mediates social behaviours. We conclude that ERα orchestrates sexual differentiation of the mouse brain through two mechanisms: establishing two male-biased neuron types and activating a sustained male-biased gene expression program. Collectively, our findings reveal that sex differences in gene expression are defined by hormonal activation of neuronal steroid receptors. The molecular targets we identify may underlie the effects of oestradiol on brain development, behaviour and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4229030906,"Within the tumour microenvironment, CD4+ T cells can promote or suppress antitumour responses through the recognition of antigens presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules1,2, but how cancers co-opt these physiologic processes to achieve immune evasion remains incompletely understood. Here we performed in-depth analysis of the phenotype and tumour specificity of CD4+ T cells infiltrating human melanoma specimens, finding that exhausted cytotoxic CD4+ T cells could be directly induced by melanoma cells through recognition of HLA class II-restricted neoantigens, and also HLA class I-restricted tumour-associated antigens. CD4+ T regulatory (TReg) cells could be indirectly elicited through presentation of tumour antigens via antigen-presenting cells. Notably, numerous tumour-reactive CD4+ TReg clones were stimulated directly by HLA class II-positive melanoma and demonstrated specificity for melanoma neoantigens. This phenomenon was observed in the presence of an extremely high tumour neoantigen load, which we confirmed to be associated with HLA class II positivity through the analysis of 116 melanoma specimens. Our data reveal the landscape of infiltrating CD4+ T cells in melanoma and point to the presentation of HLA class II-restricted neoantigens and direct engagement of immunosuppressive CD4+ TReg cells as a mechanism of immune evasion that is favoured in HLA class II-positive melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W4225318180,"Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been shown to model clinical response to cancer therapy. However, it remains challenging to use these models to guide timely clinical decisions for cancer patients. Here, we used droplet emulsion microfluidics with temperature control and dead-volume minimization to rapidly generate thousands of micro-organospheres (MOSs) from low-volume patient tissues, which serve as an ideal patient-derived model for clinical precision oncology. A clinical study of recently diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using an MOS-based precision oncology pipeline reliably assessed tumor drug response within 14 days, a timeline suitable for guiding treatment decisions in the clinic. Furthermore, MOSs capture original stromal cells and allow T cell penetration, providing a clinical assay for testing immuno-oncology (IO) therapies such as PD-1 blockade, bispecific antibodies, and T cell therapies on patient tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4229018596,"Stomata exert considerable effects on global carbon and water cycles by mediating gas exchange and water vapour1,2. Stomatal closure prevents water loss in response to dehydration and limits pathogen entry3,4. However, prolonged stomatal closure reduces photosynthesis and transpiration and creates aqueous apoplasts that promote colonization by pathogens. How plants dynamically regulate stomatal reopening in a changing climate is unclear. Here we show that the secreted peptides SMALL PHYTOCYTOKINES REGULATING DEFENSE AND WATER LOSS (SCREWs) and the cognate receptor kinase PLANT SCREW UNRESPONSIVE RECEPTOR (NUT) counter-regulate phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA)- and microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-induced stomatal closure. SCREWs sensed by NUT function as immunomodulatory phytocytokines and recruit SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) co-receptors to relay immune signalling. SCREWs trigger the NUT-dependent phosphorylation of ABA INSENSITIVE 1 (ABI1) and ABI2, which leads to an increase in the activity of ABI phosphatases towards OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1)-a key kinase that mediates ABA- and MAMP-induced stomatal closure5,6-and a reduction in the activity of S-type anion channels. After induction by dehydration and pathogen infection, SCREW-NUT signalling promotes apoplastic water loss and disrupts microorganism-rich aqueous habitats to limit pathogen colonization. The SCREW-NUT system is widely distributed across land plants, which suggests that it has an important role in preventing uncontrolled stomatal closure caused by abiotic and biotic stresses to optimize plant fitness."
https://openalex.org/W4229045697,"Living cilia stir, sweep and steer via swirling strokes of complex bending and twisting, paired with distinct reverse arcs1,2. Efforts to mimic such dynamics synthetically rely on multimaterial designs but face limits to programming arbitrary motions or diverse behaviours in one structure3-8. Here we show how diverse, complex, non-reciprocal, stroke-like trajectories emerge in a single-material system through self-regulation. When a micropost composed of photoresponsive liquid crystal elastomer with mesogens aligned oblique to the structure axis is exposed to a static light source, dynamic dances evolve as light initiates a travelling order-to-disorder transition front, transiently turning the structure into a complex evolving bimorph that twists and bends via multilevel opto-chemo-mechanical feedback. As captured by our theoretical model, the travelling front continuously reorients the molecular, geometric and illumination axes relative to each other, yielding pathways composed from series of twisting, bending, photophobic and phototropic motions. Guided by the model, here we choreograph a wide range of trajectories by tailoring parameters, including illumination angle, light intensity, molecular anisotropy, microstructure geometry, temperature and irradiation intervals and duration. We further show how this opto-chemo-mechanical self-regulation serves as a foundation for creating self-organizing deformation patterns in closely spaced microstructure arrays via light-mediated interpost communication, as well as complex motions of jointed microstructures, with broad implications for autonomous multimodal actuators in areas such as soft robotics7,9,10, biomedical devices11,12 and energy transduction materials13, and for fundamental understanding of self-regulated systems14,15."
https://openalex.org/W3200289215,"The Luttinger liquid (LL) model of one-dimensional (1D) electronic systems provides a powerful tool for understanding strongly correlated physics, including phenomena such as spin-charge separation1. Substantial theoretical efforts have attempted to extend the LL phenomenology to two dimensions, especially in models of closely packed arrays of 1D quantum wires2-13, each being described as a LL. Such coupled-wire models have been successfully used to construct two-dimensional (2D) anisotropic non-Fermi liquids2-6, quantum Hall states7-9, topological phases10,11 and quantum spin liquids12,13. However, an experimental demonstration of high-quality arrays of 1D LLs suitable for realizing these models remains absent. Here we report the experimental realization of 2D arrays of 1D LLs with crystalline quality in a moiré superlattice made of twisted bilayer tungsten ditelluride (tWTe2). Originating from the anisotropic lattice of the monolayer, the moiré pattern of tWTe2 hosts identical, parallel 1D electronic channels, separated by a fixed nanoscale distance, which is tuneable by the interlayer twist angle. At a twist angle of approximately 5 degrees, we find that hole-doped tWTe2 exhibits exceptionally large transport anisotropy with a resistance ratio of around 1,000 between two orthogonal in-plane directions. The across-wire conductance exhibits power-law scaling behaviours, consistent with the formation of a 2D anisotropic phase that resembles an array of LLs. Our results open the door for realizing a variety of correlated and topological quantum phases based on coupled-wire models and LL physics."
https://openalex.org/W4229040227,"Abstract Enzymatic stereoselectivity has typically been unrivalled by most chemical catalysts, especially in the conversion of small substrates. According to the ‘lock-and-key theory’ 1,2 , enzymes have confined active sites to accommodate their specific reacting substrates, a feature that is typically absent from chemical catalysts. An interesting case in this context is the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones and HCN, as this reaction can be catalysed by various classes of catalysts, including biological, inorganic and organic ones 3–7 . We now report the development of broadly applicable confined organocatalysts for the highly enantioselective cyanosilylation of aromatic and aliphatic ketones, including the challenging 2-butanone. The selectivity (98:2 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)) obtained towards its pharmaceutically relevant product is unmatched by any other catalyst class, including engineered biocatalysts. Our results indicate that confined chemical catalysts can be designed that are as selective as enzymes in converting small, unbiased substrates, while still providing a broad scope."

https://openalex.org/W4229001659,"Abstract Phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) has a key role in lymphocytes, and inhibitors that target this PI3K have been approved for treatment of B cell malignancies 1–3 . Although studies in mouse models of solid tumours have demonstrated that PI3Kδ inhibitors (PI3Kδi) can induce anti-tumour immunity 4,5 , its effect on solid tumours in humans remains unclear. Here we assessed the effects of the PI3Kδi AMG319 in human patients with head and neck cancer in a neoadjuvant, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized phase II trial (EudraCT no. 2014-004388-20). PI3Kδ inhibition decreased the number of tumour-infiltrating regulatory T (T reg ) cells and enhanced the cytotoxic potential of tumour-infiltrating T cells. At the tested doses of AMG319, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) required treatment to be discontinued in 12 out of 21 of patients treated with AMG319, suggestive of systemic effects on T reg cells. Accordingly, in mouse models, PI3Kδi decreased the number of T reg cells systemically and caused colitis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a PI3Kδi-driven loss of tissue-resident colonic ST2 T reg cells, accompanied by expansion of pathogenic T helper 17 (T H 17) and type 17 CD8 + T (T C 17) cells, which probably contributed to toxicity; this points towards a specific mode of action for the emergence of irAEs. A modified treatment regimen with intermittent dosing of PI3Kδi in mouse models led to a significant decrease in tumour growth without inducing pathogenic T cells in colonic tissue, indicating that alternative dosing regimens might limit toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4229033126,"The entry of mammalian cells into the DNA synthesis phase (S phase) represents a key event in cell division1. According to current models of the cell cycle, the kinase CDC7 constitutes an essential and rate-limiting trigger of DNA replication, acting together with the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2. Here we show that CDC7 is dispensable for cell division of many different cell types, as determined using chemical genetic systems that enable acute shutdown of CDC7 in cultured cells and in live mice. We demonstrate that another cell cycle kinase, CDK1, is also active during G1/S transition both in cycling cells and in cells exiting quiescence. We show that CDC7 and CDK1 perform functionally redundant roles during G1/S transition, and at least one of these kinases must be present to allow S-phase entry. These observations revise our understanding of cell cycle progression by demonstrating that CDK1 physiologically regulates two distinct transitions during cell division cycle, whereas CDC7 has a redundant function in DNA replication. In addition to CDC7, the cell cycle kinase CDK1 has a pivotal role in the G1/S transition of cells, a finding that revises our current understanding of cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W4229028898,"The cochlea uses two types of mechanosensory cell to detect sounds. A single row of inner hair cells (IHCs) synapse onto neurons to transmit sensory information to the brain, and three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs) selectively amplify auditory inputs1. So far, two transcription factors have been implicated in the specific differentiation of OHCs, whereas, to our knowledge, none has been identified in the differentiation of IHCs2-4. One such transcription factor for OHCs, INSM1, acts during a crucial embryonic period to consolidate the OHC fate, preventing OHCs from transdifferentiating into IHCs2. In the absence of INSM1, embryonic OHCs misexpress a core set of IHC-specific genes, which we predict are involved in IHC differentiation. Here we find that one of these genes, Tbx2, is a master regulator of IHC versus OHC differentiation in mice. Ablation of Tbx2 in embryonic IHCs results in their development as OHCs, expressing early OHC markers such as Insm1 and eventually becoming completely mature OHCs in the position of IHCs. Furthermore, Tbx2 is epistatic to Insm1: in the absence of both genes, cochleae generate only OHCs, which suggests that TBX2 is necessary for the abnormal transdifferentiation of INSM1-deficient OHCs into IHCs, as well as for normal IHC differentiation. Ablation of Tbx2 in postnatal, largely differentiated IHCs makes them transdifferentiate directly into OHCs, replacing IHC features with those of mature and not embryonic OHCs. Finally, ectopic expression of Tbx2 in OHCs results in their transdifferentiation into IHCs. Hence, Tbx2 is both necessary and sufficient to make IHCs distinct from OHCs and maintain this difference throughout development."
https://openalex.org/W4229070682,"When electrons populate a flat band their kinetic energy becomes negligible, forcing them to organize in exotic many-body states to minimize their Coulomb energy1-5. The zeroth Landau level of graphene under a magnetic field is a particularly interesting strongly interacting flat band because interelectron interactions are predicted to induce a rich variety of broken-symmetry states with distinct topological and lattice-scale orders6-11. Evidence for these states stems mostly from indirect transport experiments that suggest that broken-symmetry states are tunable by boosting the Zeeman energy12 or by dielectric screening of the Coulomb interaction13. However, confirming the existence of these ground states requires a direct visualization of their lattice-scale orders14. Here we image three distinct broken-symmetry phases in graphene using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. We explore the phase diagram by tuning the screening of the Coulomb interaction by a low- or high-dielectric-constant environment, and with a magnetic field. In the unscreened case, we find a Kekulé bond order, consistent with observations of an insulating state undergoing a magnetic-field driven Kosterlitz-Thouless transition15,16. Under dielectric screening, a sublattice-unpolarized ground state13 emerges at low magnetic fields, and transits to a charge-density-wave order with partial sublattice polarization at higher magnetic fields. The Kekulé and charge-density-wave orders furthermore coexist with additional, secondary lattice-scale orders that enrich the phase diagram beyond current theory predictions6-10. This screening-induced tunability of broken-symmetry orders may prove valuable to uncover correlated phases of matter in other quantum materials."
https://openalex.org/W3159207138,"Effective conservation actions require effective population monitoring. However, accurately counting animals in the wild to inform conservation decision-making is difficult. Monitoring populations through image sampling has made data collection cheaper, wide-reaching and less intrusive but created a need to process and analyse this data efficiently. Counting animals from such data is challenging, particularly when densely packed in noisy images. Attempting this manually is slow and expensive, while traditional computer vision methods are limited in their generalisability. Deep learning is the state-of-the-art method for many computer vision tasks, but it has yet to be properly explored to count animals. To this end, we employ deep learning, with a density-based regression approach, to count fish in low-resolution sonar images. We introduce a large dataset of sonar videos, deployed to record wild Lebranche mullet schools (Mugil liza) , with a subset of 500 labelled images. We utilise abundant unlabelled data in a self-supervised task to improve the supervised counting task. For the first time in this context, by introducing uncertainty quantification, we improve model training and provide an accompanying measure of prediction uncertainty for more informed biological decision-making. Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of our proposed counting framework through testing it on a recent benchmark dataset of high-resolution annotated underwater images from varying habitats (DeepFish). From experiments on both contrasting datasets, we demonstrate our network outperforms the few other deep learning models implemented for solving this task. By providing an open-source framework along with training data, our study puts forth an efficient deep learning template for crowd counting aquatic animals thereby contributing effective methods to assess natural populations from the ever-increasing visual data."
https://openalex.org/W4229062235,"In preparation for mitotic cell division, the nuclear DNA of human cells is compacted into individualized, X-shaped chromosomes1. This metamorphosis is driven mainly by the combined action of condensins and topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A)2,3, and has been observed using microscopy for over a century. Nevertheless, very little is known about the structural organization of a mitotic chromosome. Here we introduce a workflow to interrogate the organization of human chromosomes based on optical trapping and manipulation. This allows high-resolution force measurements and fluorescence visualization of native metaphase chromosomes to be conducted under tightly controlled experimental conditions. We have used this method to extensively characterize chromosome mechanics and structure. Notably, we find that under increasing mechanical load, chromosomes exhibit nonlinear stiffening behaviour, distinct from that predicted by classical polymer models4. To explain this anomalous stiffening, we introduce a hierarchical worm-like chain model that describes the chromosome as a heterogeneous assembly of nonlinear worm-like chains. Moreover, through inducible degradation of TOP2A5 specifically in mitosis, we provide evidence that TOP2A has a role in the preservation of chromosome compaction. The methods described here open the door to a wide array of investigations into the structure and dynamics of both normal and disease-associated chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W4229078492,"Herpesviruses have mastered host cell modulation and immune evasion to augment productive infection, life-long latency and reactivation1,2. A long appreciated, yet undefined relationship exists between the lytic-latent switch and viral non-coding RNAs3,4. Here we identify viral microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inhibition of host miRNA processing as a cellular mechanism that human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) exploits to disrupt mitochondrial architecture, evade intrinsic host defences and drive the switch from latent to lytic virus infection. We demonstrate that virus-encoded miR-aU14 selectively inhibits the processing of multiple miR-30 family members by direct interaction with the respective primary (pri)-miRNA hairpin loops. Subsequent loss of miR-30 and activation of the miR-30-p53-DRP1 axis triggers a profound disruption of mitochondrial architecture. This impairs induction of type I interferons and is necessary for both productive infection and virus reactivation. Ectopic expression of miR-aU14 triggered virus reactivation from latency, identifying viral miR-aU14 as a readily druggable master regulator of the herpesvirus lytic-latent switch. Our results show that miRNA-mediated inhibition of miRNA processing represents a generalized cellular mechanism that can be exploited to selectively target individual members of miRNA families. We anticipate that targeting miR-aU14 will provide new therapeutic options for preventing herpesvirus reactivations in HHV-6-associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4225301692,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the spiking projection neurons of the eye that encode different features of the visual environment. The circuits providing synaptic input to different RGC types to drive feature selectivity have been studied extensively, but there has been less research aimed at understanding the intrinsic properties and how they impact feature selectivity. We introduce an RGC type in the mouse, the Bursty Suppressed-by-Contrast (bSbC) RGC, and compared it to the OFF sustained alpha (OFFsA). Differences in their contrast response functions arose from differences not in synaptic inputs but in their intrinsic properties. Spike generation was the key intrinsic property behind this functional difference; the bSbC RGC undergoes depolarization block while the OFFsA RGC maintains a high spike rate. Our results demonstrate that differences in intrinsic properties allow these two RGC types to detect and relay distinct features of an identical visual stimulus to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W4229080820,"Congenital viral infections are believed to damage the developing neonatal brain. However, whether neonates exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) show manifestations of such damage remains unclear. For neurodevelopment evaluation, general movement assessments have been shown to be effective in identifying early indicators of neurological dysfunction, including the absence of fidgety movements. This study compared the early motor repertoire by general movement assessment at three to five months of age in neonates who were or were not prenatally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to determine whether infants prenatally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of developing neurological disorders. Fifty-six infants, including 28 in the exposed group of mothers without vaccination who had no need for intensive care and likely had SARS-CoV-2 infection close to the time of pregnancy resolution and 28 infants in the nonexposed group, were videotaped to compare their detailed early motor repertoires, in which a motor optimality score-revised (MOS-R) was calculated using Prechtl's method by using the chi-square or Mann-Whitney U tests. In the exposed group, 3 (11%) infants showed the absence of fidgety movements with a total MOS-R<14 points, and 3 (11%) other infants showed abnormal fidgety movements. Between groups, atypical body symmetry (p = 0.009) and MOS-R values were significantly lower (Z = -3.08, p = 0.002), with a large size effect (Cohen's d = 0.97). The consequences of this new virus go beyond the health of the pregnant mother, and these consequences in some of the infants in the exposed group are likely not transitory because of the absence of fidgety movements between 3-5 months; thus, these babies are at increased risk of developing a serious neurological disorder."

The purpose of this study is to assess the association between COVID-19 outcomes and existing cancer-specific characteristics.Patients aged 18 or older with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between June 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were identified (n = 314 004) from the Optum® de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record (EHR) derived from more than 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in the United States. To allow sufficient observational time, patients with less than one year of medical history in the EHR dataset before their COVID-19 tests were excluded (n = 42 365). Assessed COVID-19 outcomes including all-cause 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, and ventilator use, which were compared using relative risks (RRs) according to cancer status and treatments.Among 271 639 patients with COVID-19, 18 460 had at least one cancer diagnosis: 8034 with a history of cancer and 10 426 with newly diagnosed cancer within one year of COVID-19 infection. Patients with a cancer diagnosis were older and more likely to be male, white, Medicare beneficiaries, and have higher prevalences of chronic conditions. Cancer patients had higher risks for 30-day mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, P = 0.028) and hospitalization (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, P = 0.006) but without significant differences in ICU admission and ventilator use compared to non-cancer patients. Recent cancer diagnoses were associated with higher risks for worse COVID-19 outcomes (RR for mortality 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.25, P<0.001 and RR for hospitalization 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14, P<0.001), particularly among recent metastatic (stage IV), hematological, liver and lung cancers compared with the non-cancer group. Among COVID-19 patients with recent cancer diagnosis, mortality was associated with chemotherapy or radiation treatments within 3 months before COVID-19. Age, black patients, Medicare recipients, South geographic region, cardiovascular, diabetes, liver, and renal diseases were also associated with increased mortality.Individuals with cancer had higher risks for 30-day mortality and hospitalization after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients without cancer. More specifically, patients with a cancer diagnosis within 1 year and those receiving active treatment were more vulnerable to worse COVID-19 outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4229038702,"Progress towards the realization of quantum computers requires persistent advances in their constituent building blocks—qubits. Novel qubit platforms that simultaneously embody long coherence, fast operation and large scalability offer compelling advantages in the construction of quantum computers and many other quantum information systems1–3. Electrons, ubiquitous elementary particles of non-zero charge, spin and mass, have commonly been perceived as paradigmatic local quantum information carriers. Despite superior controllability and configurability, their practical performance as qubits through either motional or spin states depends critically on their material environment3–5. Here we report our experimental realization of a qubit platform based on isolated single electrons trapped on an ultraclean solid neon surface in vacuum6–13. By integrating an electron trap in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture14–20, we achieve strong coupling between the motional states of a single electron and a single microwave photon in an on-chip superconducting resonator. Qubit gate operations and dispersive readout are implemented to measure the energy relaxation time T1 of 15 μs and phase coherence time T2 over 200 ns. These results indicate that the electron-on-solid-neon qubit already performs near the state of the art for a charge qubit21. A solid-state single-electron qubit platform is demonstrated based on trapping and manipulating isolated single electrons on an ultraclean solid neon surface in vacuum, which performs near the state of the art for a charge qubit."
https://openalex.org/W4228997170,"During the initiation of DNA replication, oligonucleotide primers are synthesized de novo by primases and are subsequently extended by replicative polymerases to complete genome duplication. The primase-polymerase (Prim-Pol) superfamily is a diverse grouping of primases, which includes replicative primases and CRISPR-associated primase-polymerases (CAPPs) involved in adaptive immunity1-3. Although much is known about the activities of these enzymes, the precise mechanism used by primases to initiate primer synthesis has not been elucidated. Here we identify the molecular bases for the initiation of primer synthesis by CAPP and show that this mechanism is also conserved in replicative primases. The crystal structure of a primer initiation complex reveals how the incoming nucleotides are positioned within the active site, adjacent to metal cofactors and paired to the templating single-stranded DNA strand, before synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond. Furthermore, the structure of a Prim-Pol complex with double-stranded DNA shows how the enzyme subsequently extends primers in a processive polymerase mode. The structural and mechanistic studies presented here establish how Prim-Pol proteins instigate primer synthesis, revealing the requisite molecular determinants for primer synthesis within the catalytic domain. This work also establishes that the catalytic domain of Prim-Pol enzymes, including replicative primases, is sufficient to catalyse primer formation."
https://openalex.org/W4229034731,"In this study, we evaluated a commercially available computer assisted diagnosis system (CAD). The deep learning algorithm of the CAD was trained with a lung cancer screening cohort and developed for detection, classification, quantification, and growth of actionable pulmonary nodules on chest CT scans. Here, we evaluated the CAD in a retrospective cohort of a routine clinical population.In total, a number of 337 scans of 314 different subjects with reported nodules of 3-30 mm in size were included into the evaluation. Two independent thoracic radiologists alternately reviewed scans with or without CAD assistance to detect, classify, segment, and register pulmonary nodules. A third, more experienced, radiologist served as an adjudicator. In addition, the cohort was analyzed by the CAD alone. The study cohort was divided into five different groups: 1) 178 CT studies without reported pulmonary nodules, 2) 95 studies with 1-10 pulmonary nodules, 23 studies from the same patients with 3) baseline and 4) follow-up studies, and 5) 18 CT studies with subsolid nodules. A reference standard for nodules was based on majority consensus with the third thoracic radiologist as required. Sensitivity, false positive (FP) rate and Dice inter-reader coefficient were calculated.After analysis of 470 pulmonary nodules, the sensitivity readings for radiologists without CAD and radiologist with CAD, were 71.9% (95% CI: 66.0%, 77.0%) and 80.3% (95% CI: 75.2%, 85.0%) (p < 0.01), with average FP rate of 0.11 and 0.16 per CT scan, respectively. Accuracy and kappa of CAD for classifying solid vs sub-solid nodules was 94.2% and 0.77, respectively. Average inter-reader Dice coefficient for nodule segmentation was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.96) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.95) for CAD versus readers. Mean growth percentage discrepancy of readers and CAD alone was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.21) and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 4.99), respectively.The applied CAD significantly increased radiologist's detection of actionable nodules yet also minimally increasing the false positive rate. The CAD can automatically classify and quantify nodules and calculate nodule growth rate in a cohort of a routine clinical population. Results suggest this Deep Learning software has the potential to assist chest radiologists in the tasks of pulmonary nodule detection and management within their routine clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4228996459,"Over a dozen millisecond pulsars are ablating low-mass companions in close binary systems. In the original ‘black widow’, the eight-hour orbital period eclipsing pulsar PSR J1959+2048 (PSR B1957+20)1, high-energy emission originating from the pulsar2 is irradiating and may eventually destroy3 a low-mass companion. These systems are not only physical laboratories that reveal the interesting results of exposing a close companion star to the relativistic energy output of a pulsar, but are also believed to harbour some of the most massive neutron stars4, allowing for robust tests of the neutron star equation of state. Here we report observations of ZTF J1406+1222, a wide hierarchical triple hosting a 62-minute orbital period black widow candidate, the optical flux of which varies by a factor of more than ten. ZTF J1406+1222 pushes the boundaries of evolutionary models5, falling below the 80-minute minimum orbital period of hydrogen-rich systems. The wide tertiary companion is a rare low-metallicity cool subdwarf star, and the system has a Galactic halo orbit consistent with passing near the Galactic Centre, making it a probe of formation channels, neutron star kick physics6 and binary evolution. ZTF J1406+1222 is a wide hierarchical triple system that hosts a low-metallicity subdwarf star and a ‘black widow’ millisecond pulsar that has a highly varying optical flux and a 62-minute period."

There has been significant research interrogating the disparate impact of the virus, and recently, interest in the long-term implications of the global crisis on young people’s mental health and wellbeing. However, less work explores the experiences of young people from racialised backgrounds as they navigate the pandemic, and the specific consequences this has for their mental health. Forty young people (age 16–25) from Black, mixed and other minority backgrounds and living in London, participated in consecutive focus group discussions over a two-month period, to explore the impact of the pandemic on their lives and emotional wellbeing. Thematic analysis identified seven thematic categories describing the impact of the pandemic, indicating: deepening of existing socioeconomic and emotional challenges; efforts to navigate racism and difference within the response; and survival strategies drawing on communal and individual resources. Young people also articulated visions for a future public health response which addressed gaps in current strategies. Findings point to the need to contextualize public health responses to the pandemic in line with the lived experiences of racialised young people. We specifically note the importance of long-term culturally and socio-politically relevant support interventions. Implications for policy and practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4229077710,"Barbiturates are proposed as a second/third line treatment for intracranial hypertension in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, but the literature remains uncertain regarding their benefit/risk balance. We aimed to evaluate the impact of barbiturates therapy in TBI patients with early intracranial hypertension on the intensive care unit (ICU) survival, the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient's functional status at three months. We used the French AtlanREA prospective cohort of trauma patients. Using a propensity score-based methodology (inverse probability of treatment weighting), we compared patients having received barbiturates within the first 24 hours of admission (barbiturates group) and those who did not (control group). We used cause-specific Cox models for ICU survival and risk of VAP, and logistic regression for the 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) evaluation. Among the 1396 patients with severe trauma, 383 had intracranial hypertension on admission and were analyzed. Among them, 96 (25.1%) received barbiturates. The early use of barbiturates was significantly associated with increased ICU mortality (HR = 1.85, 95%CI 1.03-3.33). However, barbiturates treatment was not significantly associated with VAP (HR = 1.02, 95%CI 0.75-1.41) or 3-month GOS (OR = 1.67, 95%CI 0.84-3.33). Regarding the absence of relevant clinical trials, our results suggest that each early prescription of barbiturates requires a careful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio."

This study explored challenges perceived by healthcare providers and provides strategies in communication with low health literate patients. Primary and secondary healthcare providers (N = 396) filled in an online survey. We assessed the frequency of challenges prior to, during and following a consultation, and which strategies were used and recommended. Survey outcomes were validated in in-depth interviews with healthcare providers (N = 7). Providers (76%) reported one or more challenges that were subscribed to patients' difficulties in comprehending or applying health-related information, in communicating with professionals, or in taking responsibility for their health. Providers (31%) perceived difficulties in recognizing low health literate patients, and 50% rarely used health literacy specific materials. Providers expressed needs for support to recognize and discuss low health literacy, to adapt communication and to assess patient's comprehension. Future research should focus on developing strategies for providers to ensure patients' understanding (e.g. applying teach-back method), to recognize low health literate patients, and to support patients' in taking responsibility for their health (e.g. motivational interviewing)."
https://openalex.org/W4229019698,"Early detection and management of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is crucial for improving patients' quality of life. Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is one of the most problematic ADRs for cancer patients. Recently, an increasing number of patients post their daily experiences to internet community, for example in blogs, where potential ADR signals not captured through routine clinic visits can be described. Therefore, this study aimed to identify patients with potential ADRs, focusing on HFS, from internet blogs by using natural language processing (NLP) deep-learning methods. From 10,646 blog posts, written in Japanese by cancer patients, 149 HFS-positive sentences were extracted after pre-processing, annotation and scrutiny by a certified oncology pharmacist. The HFS-positive sentences described not only HFS typical expressions like ""pain"" or ""spoon nail"", but also patient-derived unique expressions like onomatopoeic ones. The dataset was divided at a 4 to 1 ratio and used to train and evaluate three NLP deep-learning models: long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). The BERT model gave the best performance with precision 0.63, recall 0.82 and f1 score 0.71 in the HFS user identification task. Our results demonstrate that this NLP deep-learning model can successfully identify patients with potential HFS from blog posts, where patients' real wordings on symptoms or impacts on their daily lives are described. Thus, it should be feasible to utilize patient-generated text data to improve ADR management for individual patients."
https://openalex.org/W4229063478,"Background Predicting reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after resection of a benign or low-grade brain tumour provides the opportunity for early intervention, and targeted expenditure of scarce supportive care resources. We aimed to develop, and evaluate the performance of, machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict HRQoL outcomes in this patient group. Methods Using a large prospective dataset of HRQoL outcomes in patients surgically treated for low grade glioma, acoustic neuroma and meningioma, we investigated the capability of ML to predict a) HRQoL-impacting symptoms persisting between 12 and 60 months from tumour resection and b) a decline in global HRQoL by more than the minimum clinically important difference below a normative population mean within 12 and 60 months after resection. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to measure the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of models. Six ML algorithms were explored per outcome: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, K Neighbours Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting Machine. Results The final cohort included 262 patients. Outcome measures for which AUC&gt;0.9 were Appetite loss, Constipation, Nausea and vomiting, Diarrhoea, Dyspnoea and Fatigue. AUC was between 0.8 and 0.9 for global HRQoL and Financial difficulty. Pain and Insomnia achieved AUCs below 0.8. PR-AUCs were similar overall to the AUC of each respective classifier. Conclusions ML algorithms based on routine demographic and perioperative data show promise in their ability to predict HRQoL outcomes in patients with low grade and benign brain tumours between 12 and 60 months after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4229014962,"Studies covering the social valuation of ecosystem services (ES) are increasingly incorporating people's attitudes, which allows social heterogeneity to be identified. This is especially relevant in mountain areas, where diverse complex interactions occur among the environment, the socioeconomic system, and a wide variety of farming practices. In this context, we aimed to: (i) identify the attitudinal dimensions that build people views about the agrifood system; and (ii) analyse how these attitudinal dimensions influence the value given to ES delivered by mountain agroecosystems of two European countries. We conducted a survey with a sample of 1008 individuals evenly distributed in the Italian Alps and Spanish Mediterranean mountain areas to collect information on people's attitudes toward: (i) the economy and the environment; (ii) rural development and agricultural intensification; (iii) food quality, production, and consumption; and (iv) agricultural and environmental policies. The survey included a choice experiment to assess the value that individuals attach to the most relevant ES provided by mountain agroecosystems in these areas (i.e., landscape, biodiversity, quality local products, wildfires prevention and water quality). The results showed four common attitudinal dimensions, namely Economy over environment, Mass-Market distribution reliability, Agricultural productivism, and Environmentalism and rural lifestyle. These attitudinal dimensions resulted in six groups of respondents. Most groups positively valued an increase in the delivery of all the analysed ES, which suggests that agricultural policies which aim to promote ES are likely to receive social support in the study areas. However, the differing attitudinal dimensions underlying people's preferences may result in disagreements about the steps to be taken to achieve the desired increase in ES delivery."

Propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox regression method were used to control and adjust for confounding factors. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients were managed with either CA/LoP (cephalosporin, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir) (n = 57), CA/HQ (cephalosporin, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine) (n = 25) or standard supportive care (n = 217). We analyzed the association between treatment group and standard supportive group in terms of three endpoints: time to symptom resolution, time to viral clearance, and hospital stay duration. Using propensity-score matching analysis, three rounds of propensity-matching analysis were performed to balance baseline characteristics among three cohorts.Kaplan-Meier curves fitted using propensity score-matched data revealed no significant differences on time to symptom resolution, time to viral clearance, hospital stay duration among the three treatment arms (CA/LoP vs Standard, log-rank p-value = 0.2, 0.58, and 0.74 respectively for the three endpoints) (CA/HQ vs Standard, log-rank p-value = 0.46, 0.99, and 0.75 respectively). Similarly, Cox regression analysis on matched cohorts of CA/LoP and standard supportive group showed that hazard ratios of time to symptom resolution (HR: 1.447 [95%-CI: 0.813-2.577]), time to viral clearance(HR: 0.861, [95%-CI: 0.485-1.527]), and hospital stay duration (HR: 0.902, [95%-CI: 0.510-1.595]) were not significant. For CA/HQ and standard supportive group, hazard ratios of the three endpoints all showed no statistical significance (HR: 1.331 [95%-CI:0.631-2.809], 1.005 [95%-CI:0.480-2.105], and 0.887, [95%-CI:0.422-1.862] respectively). No severe adverse event or death was observed in all groups.Combined treatment of 3rd cephalosporin, azithromycin and either low-dose lopinavir/ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine was not associated with better clinical outcomes in terms of time to symptom resolution, time to viral clearance, and hospital stay duration compared to standard supportive treatment alone. Microbiological evidence should be closely monitored when treating SARS-CoV-2 patients with antibiotics to prevent indiscreet administration of empirical antimicrobial treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4229049228,"Model organisms mimicking the pathogenesis of human diseases are useful for identifying pathogenic mechanisms and testing therapeutic efficacy of compounds targeting them. Models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) aim to reproduce the brain pathology associated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Transgenic models, which involve random insertion of disease-causing genes under the control of artificial promoters, are efficient means of doing so. There are confounding factors associated with transgenic approaches, however, including target gene overexpression, dysregulation of endogenous gene expression at transgenes' integration sites, and limitations in mimicking loss-of-function mechanisms. Furthermore, the choice of species is important, and there are anatomical, physiological, and cognitive reasons for favoring the rat over the mouse, which has been the standard for models of neurodegeneration and dementia. We report an initial assessment of the spatial learning, reversal, and sequencing task capabilities of knock-in (KI) Long-Evans rats with humanizing mutations in the Aβ-coding region of App, which encodes amyloid precursor protein (Apph/h rats), using the IntelliCage, an automated operant social home cage system, at 6-8 weeks of age, then again at 4-5 months of age. These rats were previously generated as control organisms for studies on neurodegeneration involving other knock-in rat models from our lab. Apph/h rats of either sex can acquire place learning and reversal tasks. They can also acquire a diagonal sequencing task by 6-8 weeks of age, but not a more advanced serial reversal task involving alternating diagonals, even by 4-5 months of age. Thus, longitudinal behavioral analysis with the IntelliCage system can be useful to determine, in follow-up studies, whether KI rat models of Familial AD (FAD), sporadic late onset AD (LOAD), and of ADRD develop aging-dependent learning and memory deficits."

Therefore, we investigated whether a history of salpingectomy affects the number of oocytes retrieved in women undergoing IVF in comparison with the number in women without underlying tubal disease.Case-control study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2).A tertiary hospital-affiliated fertility center.Fifty-four women aged <35 years with a history of salpingectomy and 59 age-matched women without tubal disease.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation and transvaginal oocyte retrieval.The antral follicle count (AFC), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, and the number of retrieved oocytes were significantly lower in women with prior salpingectomy than in women without tubal disease. Day-3 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, total gonadotropin dosage, and stimulation days did not significantly differ between the groups. The indications of salpingectomy (i.e., hydrosalpinx and ectopic pregnancy) did not differ significantly in terms of ovarian response or reserve among women with salpingectomy history. A history of salpingectomy and other factors related to ovarian response in IVF, such as age, AMH, AFC, day-3 FSH, and total gonadotropin dose, were significantly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved by univariate regression analysis. In the multivariate-adjusted model after controlling all the above-mentioned variables, only AFC and AMH levels continued to exhibit significant associations with the number of retrieved oocytes. In a subgroup analysis, the negative impact of prior salpingectomy on the number of retrieved oocytes was especially significant in women with suboptimal ovarian reserves (defined as AMH < 4 ng/mL), regardless of the indication of salpingectomy or whether salpingectomy was bilateral or unilateral.A negative effect on the number of retrieved oocytes in the subsequent IVF cycle after salpingectomy is more likely in women aged <35 years with suboptimal ovarian reserve. Nevertheless, postsurgical AMH and AFC levels still possess a more direct predictive value on ovarian response than the history of salpingectomy."
https://openalex.org/W4229073104,"Task allocation is a fundamental requirement for multi-robot systems working in dynamic environments. An efficient task allocation algorithm allows the robots to adjust their behavior in response to environmental changes such as fault occurrences, or other robots’ actions to increase overall system performance. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Task Allocation technique based on a threshold level which is an accumulative value aggregated by a centralized unit using the Task-Robot ratio and the number of the available resource in the system. The threshold level serves as a reference for task acceptance and the task acceptance occurs despite resource shortage. The deficient resources for the accepted task are acquired through an auction process using objective minimization. Despite resource shortage, task acceptance occurs. The threshold approach and the objective minimization in the auction process reduce the overall completion time and increase the system’s resource utilization up to 96%, which is demonstrated theoretically and validated through simulations and real experimentation."
https://openalex.org/W4229075585,"Research consistently shows that students from academic households are more likely to enter higher education than students from non-academic households. These inequalities are only secondarily due to differences in performance (i.e., primary effects), but mostly due to students' decision making behavior (i.e., secondary effects). The relative share to which primary effects and secondary effects mediate the effect of students' educational background on their intention to enter higher education is affected by external conditions. One significant external influence that may have had an impact on social disparities in students' educational choices is the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we present data from N = 596 upper secondary students (41.6% from non-academic households) that were collected in Germany in April 2021. Building on rational choice theory, we scrutinized students' expected benefits (i.e., employment prospects and personal significance), costs (i.e., direct costs and opportunity costs), and subjective probability of success in pursuing higher education as important psychological pillars for their intention to enter higher education. Results show that about 14% of social differences in students' intention to enter higher education were due to primary effects, whereas almost 77% were explained by secondary effects. Specifically, we found that differences in the evaluation of benefits most strongly contributed to social inequalities in students' intention to enroll in higher education. Compared to research on pre- COVID-19 cohorts, our results point to shifts in existing patterns of inequalities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Participants were categorized into two groups: full breastfeeding (FB) and non-full breastfeeding (NFB) groups. Postpartum weight changes between the FB (n = 26,340) and NFB (n = 38,129) groups were compared.At 6 months postpartum, mean weight retention was significantly lower in the FB group than in the NFB group (0.2 vs 0.8 kg, respectively, p<0.001). Weight retention differed by pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), with postpartum weights of overweight (pre-pregnancy BMI 25.0-29.9) and obese (pre-pregnancy BMI ≥30.0) participants being lower than pre-pregnancy weight; this trend was more pronounced in the FB group than in the NFB group (overweight: -2.2 vs -0.7 kg, respectively; obese: -4.8 vs -3.4 kg, respectively). Factors affecting weight retention at 6 months postpartum were weight gain during pregnancy (β = 0.43; p<0.001), pre-pregnancy BMI (β = -0.147; p<0.001) and feeding method. FB resulted in lower weight retention than NFB (β = -0.107; p<0.001).Breastfeeding reduced maternal weight retention, which was greater in mothers who were obese before pregnancy.

https://openalex.org/W4229023851,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) are one of the main constituents of the innate immune system in mammals. They can detect conserved microbial structures (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and host-derived ligands that are produced during cellular stress and damage (danger-associated molecular patterns) and may then initiate an intracellular signaling cascade leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immediate immune responses. Some TLR (TLR1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) are expressed on the cell surface while others (TLR3, 7, 8 and 9) are present on the surface of endosomes and their ligands require internalization before recognition is possible. Several TLR have also been detected in neurons where they may serve functions that are not related to immune responses. TLR2, 3, and 4 have been described in cortical neurons and, for TLR4, a seizure-promoting role in epilepsies associated with inflammation has been shown. TLR3, 7, and 8 expressed in neurons seem to influence the growth or withdrawal of neurites and robust activation of TLR8 in neurons may even induce neuronal death. The goal of the current study was to investigate the expression of TLR8 in the hippocampus of mice during postnatal development and in adulthood. We focused on three functionally distinct groups of GABAergic interneurons characterized by the expression of the molecular markers parvalbumin, somatostatin, or calretinin, and we applied double fluorescence immunohistochemistry and cell counts to quantify co-expression of TLR8 in the three groups of GABA-interneurons across hippocampal subregions. We found subregion-specific differences in the expression of TLR8 in these interneurons. During postnatal development, TLR8 was detected only in mice older than P5. While only a small fraction of hippocampal calretinin-positive interneurons expressed TLR8, most parvalbumin-positive interneurons in all hippocampal subregions co-expressed TLR8. Somatostatin-positive interneurons co-expressing TLR8 were mainly present in hippocampal sector CA3 but rare in the dentate gyrus and CA1. High expression of TLR8 in parvalbumin-interneurons may contribute to their high vulnerability in human temporal lobe epilepsy."

https://openalex.org/W4229069444,"Prion diseases are a group of fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases of mammals. In the brain, axonal loss and neuronal death are prominent in prion infection, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Sterile alpha and heat/Armadillo motif 1 (SARM1) is a protein expressed in neurons of the brain that plays a critical role in axonal degeneration. Following damage to axons, it acquires an NADase activity that helps to regulate mitochondrial health by breaking down NAD + , a molecule critical for mitochondrial respiration. SARM1 has been proposed to have a protective effect in prion disease, and we hypothesized that it its role in regulating mitochondrial energetics may be involved. We therefore analyzed mitochondrial respiration in SARM1 knockout mice (SARM1 KO ) and wild-type mice inoculated either with prions or normal brain homogenate. Pathologically, disease was similar in both strains of mice, suggesting that SARM1 mediated axonal degradation is not the sole mechanism of axonal loss during prion disease. However, mitochondrial respiration was significantly increased and disease incubation time accelerated in prion infected SARM1 KO mice when compared to wild-type mice. Increased levels of mitochondrial complexes II and IV and decreased levels of NRF2, a potent regulator of reactive oxygen species, were also apparent in the brains of SARM1 KO mice when compared to wild-type mice. Our data suggest that SARM1 slows prion disease progression, likely by regulating mitochondrial respiration, which may help to mitigate oxidative stress via NRF2."
https://openalex.org/W4225386210,"Soil water content is an important variable in hydrology and many related disciplines. It affects runoff from precipitation, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration. This research used the coal mining area of the Changhe River Basin in the Loess Plateau as a study and using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, the surface soil water in 24 days (From Jan 25, 2018 to Dec 10, 2019) was estimated using a radar signal change detection algorithm. The temporal and spatial variation characteristics of surface soil water inside and outside the disturbed area were compared and analyzed. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis method was used to analyze the potential temporal and spatial variation of surface soil water, and to detect the regional soil water variation under coal mining disturbances to better understand the different potential modes of spatial variation of soil water in the unobserved time. The results showed that the average surface soil water content in the study area changed with season, showing a dry-wet-dry variation. Moreover, it was significantly affected by precipitation factors, and its response to precipitation had a hysteresis effect. From the perspective of spatial variation, the influence of coal mining disturbance on surface soil moisture was not obvious. From the perspective of time series change, moving from wet to dry conditions, the soil in the disturbed area dried faster than the soil in the undisturbed area after soil wetted. When moving from drying to wetting, the soil in the disturbed area was quickly wetted. The EOF analysis showed that most observed spatial variability of soil moisture was stable in time. The study was conducted in a disturbed area and an undisturbed area for single EOF analysis, and the results showed that the EOF mode of the disturbed area was closer to that of the whole study area. By comparing the two subregions and the entire study area, it was found that the changes of correlation values were related to soil texture, bulk density, altitude and slope, indicating that the soil texture of the two subregions may be different at different elevations, and may also be related to the change of the original soil structure in the disturbed area. Overall, the EOF mode of the disturbed area determined the EOF mode of the entire study area."
https://openalex.org/W4229022581,"A large amount of gas, such as CO, accumulates in a coal mine after an explosion, leading to CO poisoning. In this study, a self-developed platform was used to eliminate CO from coal mines and determine the mass of the rapidly eliminated CO and its concentration in the eliminated gases. Equations were derived to calculate the amount of CO eliminated and the removing rate. The results showed that a rapid removing reagent in the form of nonprecious metal catalysts is useful for removing CO. Removing agents with larger masses facilitated the activation, irrespective of the CO concentration. For removing reagent amounts of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 g, the amount of CO eliminated, the removing rate, and the time required to complete catalytic oxidation increased sequentially. The CO removing process could be divided into three stages (I, II, and III) based on the variations in the CO, CO 2 , and O 2 concentrations during CO removing. The removing reagent first chemically adsorbs CO and O 2 , and then desorbs CO 2 . The final CO concentration tends to 0, the O 2 concentration remains stable, and the CO 2 concentration decreases. This shows that the ablation agent has an impact on the changes in the CO and CO 2 concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W4229033013,"It is puzzling how altruistic punishment of defectors can evolve in large groups of nonrelatives, since punishers should voluntarily bear individual costs of punishing to benefit those who do not pay the costs. Although two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the puzzle, namely voluntary participation and group-level competition and selection, insights into their joint effects have been less clear. Here we investigated what could be combined effects of these two mechanisms on the evolution of altruistic punishment and how these effects can vary with nonparticipants' individual payoff and group size. We modelled altruistic punishers as those who contribute to a public good and impose a fine on each defector, i.e., they are neither pure punishers nor excluders. Our simulation results show that voluntary participation has negative effects on the evolution of cooperation in small groups regardless of nonparticipants' payoffs, while in large groups it has positive effects within only a limited range of nonparticipants' payoff. We discuss that such asymmetric effects could be explained by evolutionary forces emerging from voluntary participation. Lastly, we suggest that insights from social science disciplines studying the exit option could enrich voluntary participation models."

However, stool collection requires active subject participation and may be limited by patient reluctance to handling stool.We performed a prospective study on the impact of financial incentives on stool collection rates. The intervention group consisted of allogeneic HCT patients from 05/2017-05/2018 who were compensated with a $10 gas gift card for each stool sample. The intervention group was compared to a historical control group of allogeneic HCT patients from 11/2016-05/2017 who provided stool samples before the incentive was implemented. To control for possible changes in collections over time, we also compared a contemporaneous control group of autologous HCT patients from 05/2017-05/2018 with a historical control group of autologous HCT patients from 11/2016-05/2017; neither autologous HCT group was compensated. The collection rate was defined as the number of samples provided divided by the number of time points we attempted to obtain stool.There were 35 allogeneic HCT patients in the intervention group, 19 allogeneic HCT patients in the historical control group, 142 autologous HCT patients in the contemporaneous control group (that did not receive a financial incentive), and 75 autologous HCT patients in the historical control group. Allogeneic HCT patients in the intervention group had significantly higher average overall collection rates when compared to the historical control group allogeneic HCT patients (80% vs 37%, p<0.0001). There were no significant differences in overall average collection rates between the autologous HCT patients in the contemporaneous control and historical control groups (36% vs 32%, p = 0.2760).Our results demonstrate that a modest incentive can significantly increase collection rates. These results may help to inform the design of future studies involving stool collection."

In the absence of thorough survey data, this study assessed which species benefit most from conservation areas using citizen science bird counts extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia. This was accomplished by fitting temporal models using citizen science data taken from ALA for the years 2010–2019 using the INLA approach. The trends for six resident shorebird species were compared to those for the Australian Pied Oystercatcher, with the Black-fronted Dotterel, Red-capped Dotterel, and Red-kneed Dotterel exhibiting significantly steeper increasing trends. For the Black-fronted Dotterel, Masked Lapwing, and Red-kneed Dotterel, steeper rising trends were recorded in conservation areas than in other locations. The Dotterel species’ conservation status is extremely favourable. This study demonstrates that, with some limits, statistical models can be used to track the persistence of resident shorebirds and to investigate the factors affecting these data."
