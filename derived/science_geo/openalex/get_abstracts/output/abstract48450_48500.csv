https://openalex.org/W2074783201,"The amino acid sequence of the glucose transport protein from human HepG2 hepatoma cells was deduced from analysis of a complementary DNA clone. Structural analysis of the purified human erythrocyte glucose transporter by fast atom bombardment mapping and gas phase Edman degradation confirmed the identity of the clone and demonstrated that the HepG2 and erythrocyte transporters are highly homologous and may be identical. The protein lacks a cleavable amino-terminal signal sequence. Analysis of the primary structure suggests the presence of 12 membrane-spanning domains. Several of these may form amphipathic alpha helices and contain abundant hydroxyl and amide side chains that could participate in glucose binding or line a transmembrane pore through which the sugar moves. The amino terminus, carboxyl terminus, and a highly hydrophilic domain in the center of the protein are all predicted to lie on the cytoplasmic face. Messenger RNA species homologous to HepG2 glucose transporter messenger RNA were detected in K562 leukemic cells, HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells, and human kidney tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2015032393,"Certain infections and malignancies in mammals cause the development of a condition known as cachexia in which the animal continues to lose weight, often while consuming an adequate diet. When macrophages are stimulated with an endotoxin, they produce a factor or factors, termed cachectin, that inhibits the activity of fat-producing (lipogenic) enzymes in cultured adipocytes. This effect may reflect one of the physiological bases for cachexia. In the present study, clones of complementary DNA from genes whose expression is increased during the differentiation of adipocytes were used to study the molecular basis of cachectin's actions. In the presence of cachectin, the expression of the corresponding genes was reversibly and specifically inhibited. Furthermore, when mature adipocytes were exposed to cachectin, the messenger RNA's of those genes diminished and rapidly approached the levels present before differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1559327258,"Interaction of protein synthesis initiation factors with mRNA has been studied in order to characterize early events in the eukaryotic translation pathway. Individual reovirus mRNAs labeled with 32P in the alpha position relative to the m7G cap and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4A, -4B, and -4F purified from rabbit reticulocytes were employed. It was found that eIF-4A causes a structural change in mRNA, as evidenced by a nuclease sensitivity test: addition of high concentrations of eIF-4A greatly increase the nuclease sensitivity of the mRNA, suggesting that this factor can melt or unwind mRNA structure. ATP is required for this reaction. At low concentrations of eIF-4A, addition of eIF-4B is required for maximal unwinding activity. Thus eIF-4B enhances eIF-4A activity. Addition of eIF-4F also makes the mRNA sensitive to nuclease indicating a similar unwinding role to that of eIF-4A. Stoichiometric comparisons indicate that eIF-4F is more than 20-fold more efficient than eIF-4A in catalyzing this reaction. The unwinding activity of eIF-4F is inhibited by m7GDP, while that of eIF-4A is not. This suggests that eIF-4A functions independent of the 5' cap structure. Our results also suggest that the unwinding activity of eIF-4F is located in the 46,000-dalton polypeptide of this complex, which has shown by others to be similar or identical to eIF-4A."

https://openalex.org/W1568617917,"The 20,000-dalton light chain of turkey gizzard myosin is phosphorylated at two sites. Dual phosphorylation is observed when both intact myosin and isolated light chains are used as substrates. Phosphorylation of the second site is not observed at higher ionic strength (e.g. 0.35 M KCl). The first phosphorylation site (serine 19) is phosphorylated preferentially to the second site. The latter is phosphorylated more slowly than the first site, and its phosphorylation requires relatively high concentrations of myosin light chain kinase. It is suggested that myosin light chain kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of both sites on the light chain, and several reasons are cited that make it unlikely that a contaminant kinase is involved. The second phosphorylation site is a threonine residue. Based on the results of limited proteolysis of the light chain, it is concluded that the threonine residue is close to serine 19, and possible locations are threonines 9, 10, and 18. At all concentrations of MgCl2, phosphorylation of the second site markedly increases the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin and accelerates the superprecipitation response of myosin plus actin."

https://openalex.org/W1976045951,"The new benzamide derivative [125I]iodosulpride is a highly sensitive and selective ligand for D-2 dopamine receptors and displays a very low nonspecific binding to membrane or autoradiographic sections. On autoradiographic images, D-2 receptors are present not only in well-established dopaminergic areas but also, in a discrete manner, in a number of catecholaminergic regions in which the dopaminergic innervation is still unknown, imprecise, or controversial, as in the sensorimotor cerebral cortex or cerebellum. This widespread distribution suggests larger physiological and pathophysiological roles for cerebral dopamine receptors than was previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2052226492,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is essential for the development and differentiation of sympathetic or sensory neurons. A complementary DNA was cloned that corresponds to a gene sequence induced more than 50-fold in a cultured target cell line of pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) 5 hours after the addition of NGF. The induced messenger RNA encodes a 90,000-dalton polypeptide that may represent one of the primary events in NGF-induced differentiation of neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2099446928,"We have isolated essentially full-length cDNA clones for human ferritin H and L chains from a human liver cDNA library. This allows the first comparison of H and L nucleotide and amino acid sequences from the same species as well as ferritin L cDNA sequences from different species. We conclude that human H and L ferritins are related proteins which diverged about the time of evolution of birds and mammals. We also deduce the secondary structure of the H and L subunits and compare this with the known structure of horse spleen ferritin. We find that residues involved in subunit interaction in shell assembly are highly conserved in H and L sequences. However, we find several interesting differences in H subunits at the amino acid residues involved in iron transport and deposition. These substitutions could account for known differences in the uptake, storage, and release of iron from isoferritins of different subunit composition."
https://openalex.org/W1514549854,"We have studied the effect of myosin P-light chain phosphorylation on the isometric tension generated by skinned fibers from rabbit psoas muscle at 0.6 and 10 microM Ca2+. At the lower Ca2+ concentration, which produced 10-20% of the maximal isometric tension obtained at 10 microM Ca2+, addition of purified myosin light chain resulted in a 50% increase in isometric tension which correlated with an increase in P-light chain phosphorylation from 0.10 to 0.80 mol of phosphate/mol of P-light chain. Addition of a phosphoprotein phosphatase reversed the isometric tension response and dephosphorylated P-light chain. At the higher Ca2+ concentration, P-light chain phosphorylation was found to have little effect on isometric tension. Fibers prepared and stored at -20 degrees C in a buffer containing MgATP, KF, and potassium phosphate incorporated 0.80 mol of phosphate/mol of P-light chain. Addition of phosphoprotein phosphatase to these fibers incubated at 0.6 microM Ca2+ caused a reduction in isometric tension and dephosphorylation of the P-light chain. There was no difference before and after phosphorylation of P-light chain in the normalized force-velocity relationship for fibers at the lower Ca2+ concentration, and the extrapolated maximum shortening velocity was 2.2 fiber lengths/s. Our results suggest that in vertebrate skeletal muscle, P-light chain phosphorylation increases the force level at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, probably by affecting the interaction between the myosin cross-bridge and the thin filament."
https://openalex.org/W2065248831,"A complementary DNA clone encoding the α subunit of the adenylate cyclase stimulatory G protein (Gs) was isolated and identified. A bovine brain complementary DNA library was screened with an oligonucleotide probe derived from amino acid sequence common to known G proteins. The only clone that was obtained with this probe has a complementary DNA insert of approximately 1670 base pairs. An antibody to a peptide synthesized according to deduced amino acid sequence reacts specifically with the α subunit of Gs. In addition, RNA that hybridizes with probes made from the clone is detected in wild-type S49 cells; however, cyc- S49 cells, which are deficient in Gsα activity, are devoid of this messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2097128116,"We have isolated cDNA clones for several mRNAs expressed in sympathetic neurons but not in adrenal chromaffin cells, two neural crest derivatives thought to share a common precursor. The tissue specificity, developmental expression, and hormonal regulation of these genes have been characterized using Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis. We find that these mRNAs are independently regulated in development rather than synchronously induced. Our evidence also implicates Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in the induction of one of these genes in postmigratory crest cells. Two of these genes become induced in mature chromaffin cells, which express a neuronal morphology in response to NGF. These results support the idea that the phenotypic plasticity of neural crest derivatives reflects a common precursor, the multipotentiality of which is sustained through terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2115907984,"Transthyretin cDNA was isolated from a rat liver cDNA library. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a signal peptide-like sequence preceding a section coding for a full length subunit and an untranslated sequence at the 3' end. The deduced primary structure of rat transthyretin was compared with that of human transthyretin. It was highly conserved at the binding sites for thyroxine and the interfaces and core regions of the subunits. The cDNA for transthyretin was used to measure mRNA levels by hybridization. During acute inflammation, the amount of transthyretin mRNA in liver decreased (reaching a minimum of 25% of the normal level 36 h after inducing inflammation), suggesting regulation of transthyretin synthesis at the mRNA level. Transthyretin mRNA was found only in the liver and in the choroid plexus, but not in other parts of the central nervous system nor in the adrenal glands, kidney, spleen, testes, heart, lung, intestine, and ovaries. One gram of choroid plexus contained about 25 times larger amounts of transthyretin mRNA than 1 g of liver. By synthesizing an important hormone carrier protein, the choroid plexus may be an important link in the chemical communication between the central nervous system and the bloodstream."
https://openalex.org/W2132002199,"The neuroactive peptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRF-amide) has a variety of effects on both mammalian and invertebrate tissues; moreover, FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity is found throughout the animal kingdom. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from an Aplysia abdominal ganglion cDNA library that encodes a precursor protein that may give rise to as many as 19 individual FMRFamide peptides. Nearly all of the FMRF sequences are flanked on the amino terminus by Lys-Arg residues and on the carboxy terminus by Gly-Lys residues, suggesting that the single lysine residues function to signal cleavage by processing enzymes. The gene is present in a single copy per haploid genome and gives rise to multiple transcripts, at least some of which appear to arise through alternate RNA splicing. Immunohistochemical analysis suggests that the peptide is present in many neurons throughout the Aplysia nervous system and that these neurons send processes to a variety of different tissues."

Analysis of organic synthesis can be carried out in the retrosynthetic direction, opposite to the actual process of chemical synthesis, or bidirectionally, that is, as a combined retrosynthetic and synthetic search. An interactive computer program is described which utilizes the general strategies of retrosynthetic analysis and an appropriate database to generate pathways of chemical intermediates for chemical synthesis of a particular target structure. Computer graphics and standard chemical structures are used for man-machine communication."

The open reading frame codes for 148 amino acids including a 25-amino acid signal sequence preceding the N-terminal lysine of the mature Inhibitor II. The Inhibitor II sequence exhibits two domains, one domain having a trypsin inhibitory site and the other a chymotrypsin inhibitory site, apparently evolved from a smaller gene by a process of gene duplication and elongation. The amino acid sequence of tomato leaf Inhibitor II exhibits homology with two small proteinase inhibitors isolated from potato tuber and an inhibitor from eggplant. The small potato tuber inhibitors are homologous with 33 amino acids of the N-terminal domain and 19 amino acids from the C-terminal domain. Two identical nucleotide sequences of Inhibitor II cDNA in the 3' noncoding region were present that were also found in an Inhibitor I cDNA. These include an atypical polyadenylation signal, AATAAG, and a 10-base palindromic sequence, CATTATAATG, for which no function is yet known."
https://openalex.org/W2067570894,"Mutagenesis was studied in cultured F9 embryonal carcinoma cells infected with a variant of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Proviral insertion induced the inactivation of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase locus, and the virus was used to isolate the mutated genes rapidly. Mutagenesis by these methods may be useful for the genetic dissection of the various mammalian cell phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1604572527,"Lipoprotein lipase enhances the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters from plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) to very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). In time course studies the stimulation of cholesteryl ester transfer by bovine milk lipase was correlated with accumulation of fatty acids in VLDL remnants. As the amount of fatty acid-poor albumin in the incubations was increased, there was decreased accumulation of fatty acids in VLDL remnants and a parallel decrease in the stimulation of cholesteryl ester transfer by lipolysis. Addition of sodium oleate to VLDL and albumin resulted in stimulation of the CETP-mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL. The stimulation of transfer of cholesteryl esters into previously lipolyzed VLDL was abolished by lowering the pH from 7.5 to 6.0, consistent with a role of lipoprotein ionized fatty acids. CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer from HDL to VLDL was also augmented by phosholipase A2 and by a bacterial lipase which lacked phospholipase activity. When VLDL and HDL were re-isolated after a lipolysis experiment, both lipoproteins stimulated CETP activity. Postlipolysis VLDL and HDL bound much more CETP than native VLDL or HDL. Lipolysis of apoprotein-free phospholipid/triglyceride emulsions also resulted in enhanced binding of CETP to the emulsion particles. Incubation conditions which abolished the enhanced cholesteryl ester transfer into VLDL remnants reduced binding of CETP to remnants, emulsions, and HDL. In conclusion, the enhanced CETP-mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL during lipolysis is related to the accumulation of products of lipolysis, especially fatty acids, in the lipoproteins. Lipids accumulating in VLDL remnants and HDL as a result of lipolysis may augment binding of CETP to these lipoproteins, leading to more efficient transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL."

https://openalex.org/W1534712484,"Abstract Highly purified dog heart sarcolemmal membranes, with a content of approximately 5 pmol of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR)/mg of protein, were analyzed for mAChR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and ligand binding in the absence and the presence of guanine nucleotides. Adenylyl cyclase was found to be coupled to the mAChR, being attenuated approximately 30% in a GTP-dependent manner. Direct binding studies, using 3H-labeled oxotremorine M, showed high affinity binding (apparent KD = 10 nM) that was reduced on nucleotide addition. Dose-response curves for GDP, GTP, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate showed them to be equipotent. On the basis of pirenzepine binding, only one type of mAChR, commonly referred to as M2, was detected. Direct binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) uncovered 50% more binding sites than 150 nM 3H-labeled oxotremorine M; addition of guanine nucleotides uncovered the existence of positive cooperativity in the binding of [3H]QNB. Agonist displacement curves of [3H]QNB binding, without and with guanine nucleotides, extended over several orders of magnitude, which is inconsistent with single site competitive kinetics. The results and their analysis by computer-assisted curve fitting indicated that the data are well fitted by a model in which a receptor is at least bivalent and exists in two states: one with and the other without cooperativity between its sites, with guanine nucleotides decreasing both the degree of cooperativity between the sites and the proportion of the receptor that is in the cooperative form. Since the guanine nucleotide effect is mediated by the Ni coupling protein, it is suggested that direct binding detects R'Ni complexes (cooperative), RNiG complexes (cooperative but distinct from R'Ni), and R0 complexes (non-cooperative and unaffected by Ni or NiG), where R = mAChR, Ni = the inhibitory regulatory component of adenylyl cyclase unaffected by guanine nucleotide, and NiG = Ni affected by guanine nucleotide (G)."
https://openalex.org/W2061838196,"The mouse H-2 multigene family includes the genes coding for the major transplantation antigens and for genes located in the Qa-TIa region. We have studied a collection of class I cDNA clones made from liver mRNA of DBA/2 mice (H-2d haplotype) and found that at least six distinct class I genes are transcribed, including three genes of the Qa-TIa region. Two of these six genes each yield two distinct mRNAs, resulting from alternate splicing. Altogether, liver cells may express at least eight distinct class I polypeptides, of which three might be secreted, while one may be a new presumptive nonpolymorphic surface antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1493116705,"The region of the glucocorticoid receptor that reacted with a monoclonal antibody (BUGR-1) was identified. In order to identify the immunoreactive region, the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor was subjected to limited proteolysis; immunoreactive fragments were identified by Western blotting. The monoclonal antibody reacted with both the undigested Mr approximately 97,000 receptor subunit and a Mr approximately 45,000 fragment containing the steroid-binding and DNA-binding domains. Digestion by trypsin also produced two steroid-binding fragments of Mr approximately 27,000 and 31,000 which did not react with the antibody and an immunoreactive Mr approximately 16,000 fragment. This Mr approximately 16,000 fragment was shown to bind to DNA-cellulose, indicating that it contained a DNA-binding domain of the receptor. The undigested receptor must have steroid associated with it to undergo activation to a DNA-binding form. However, the Mr approximately 16,000 immunoreactive fragment binds to DNA-cellulose even if it is obtained by digestion of the steroid-free holoreceptor which does not itself bind to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1515302288,"We have isolated a cDNA recombinant plasmid (pA29) identified as encoding part of the ventricular muscle myosin light chain MLC1v. This cDNA contains a 300-base pair fragment which under conditions of moderate stringency shows specific hybridization to MLC1v mRNA with no detectable cross-hybridization with the mRNAs encoding the fast skeletal muscle isoforms MLC1F and MLC3F, or the atrial muscle isoform MLC1A. Under these conditions hybridization is seen with an abundant mRNA present in slow skeletal muscle (soleus) which is indistinguishable from ventricular MLC1V mRNA on the basis of size and of thermal stability of hybrids formed with plasmid pA29. The mouse MLC1V and MLC1S proteins are found to co-migrate on two-dimensional gels. We therefore conclude that these isoforms are the same and are encoded by the same mRNA. Analysis of mouse DNA has identified a single region of the genome which hybridizes to this same fragment of pA29. This region has been isolated in a recombinant phage and has been shown to contain a single gene showing homology with MLC1V mRNA by R-loop analysis. We therefore conclude that MLC1V and MLC1S are encoded by a single gene. The pattern of segregation of a restriction fragment length polymorphism identified for this gene between Mus musculus and Mus spretus has been followed in an F1 backcross between these two mouse species. The results show the MLC1V/MLC1S gene to be closely linked to a marker at the distal end of mouse chromosome 9."
https://openalex.org/W1560117034,"delta-Crystallin is the principal structural protein of the embryonic chicken lens. In the chicken, there are two linked delta-crystallin genes arranged in the same transcriptional polarity (5'-delta 1-delta 2-3'). Here we have sequenced the delta 1 crystallin gene and almost 4.3 kilobases of its 5' flanking region. The delta 1 gene is 7766 base pairs in length and has 17 exons. At least one lariat branch consensus sequence has been identified in each intron. Analysis of the deduced delta-crystallin protein using a program which accounts for conservative amino acid changes shows regions of similarity within the delta 1 amino acid sequence. These suggest a rough 2-fold repeat in the protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1646166592,"Under conditions that diminish secondary structure in single-stranded DNA, stable presynaptic filaments can be formed by recA protein in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog ATP gamma S, without the need for Escherichia coli single strand binding protein. Such stable presynaptic filaments resemble those formed in the presence of ATP and pair efficiently with homologous duplex DNA. Since this kind of stable filament does not displace a strand from the duplex molecule, it provides a model substrate to study synapsis independent of the earlier and later stages of the recA reaction. Even though detectable strand displacement did not occur in the presence of ATP gamma S, both single strand and double strand breaks in duplex DNA stimulated homologous pairing. These and related observations support the view that the presynaptic nucleoprotein filament and naked duplex DNA intertwine to form a nascent joint in which the duplex DNA is partially unwound, i.e. in which the pitch of the involved duplex segment is reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1503933118,"We developed a radioimmunoassay specific for glycine-extended progastrin processing intermediates (G-Gly) using antisera generated against the synthetic peptide Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-Gly. Distribution of immunoreactivity in the porcine gastrointestinal tract obtained with this antibody paralleled that of gastrin with the mucosa containing the highest quantity, 116 +/- 22 pmol/g, wet weight (mean +/- S.E., n = 5), or roughly 4% of gastrin concentration. This immunoreactivity was localized specifically to antral mucosal G-cells by immunohistochemistry. On Sephadex G-50 column chromatography of porcine antral mucosal extracts glycine-extended progastrin processing intermediates were separated into three principal molecular forms, each corresponding to known molecular forms of gastrin, component I, tetratriacontagastrin (G34) and heptadecagastrin (G17). Following purification by antibody-coupled affinity chromatography, one molecular form corresponding to G17 in size was shown to have an amino terminus identical to that of G17. Another molecular form corresponding to G34 in size could be converted to the molecular form corresponding to G17 by tryptic digestion. Our findings indicate that glycine-extended progastrin processing intermediates may serve as immediate precursors for each molecular form of gastrin, thus suggesting an alternative pathway for gastrin biosynthesis more complex than that previously conceived."

https://openalex.org/W2092667524,"The internal motions of the double-stranded DNA oligomer (dCdG)3 (dC, deoxycytidylate; dG, deoxyguanylate) in the B and Z forms have been calculated in the harmonic approximation. A complete vibrational analysis has been made, and the resulting normal mode frequencies have been used to evaluate the vibrational entropy of B and Z DNA. The greater flexibility of the B DNA hexamer leads to an entropic stabilization relative to the stiffer Z DNA hexamer of 22 calories per mole per kelvin at 300 K. The calculated value is of the same order as that (21 to 27 calories per mole per kelvin) obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on the methylated duplexes (m5dCdG)3 and (dCdGm5dCdGdCdG). This result demonstrates the importance of internal motions, which have been neglected in earlier studies of the transition from B to Z DNA, in the stability of different nucleic acid conformers."
https://openalex.org/W1497927829,"Several, independent lutropin beta subunit cDNA clones have been isolated from a lambda gt-11 pituitary cDNA library. The complete nucleotide sequence of four clones was determined. A number of single nucleotide differences were detected including three changes within the coding sequence. One of these nucleotide changes resulted in a change in the predicted amino acid sequence, while two did not. These changes may reflect heterogeneity in the animals from which pituitaries were obtained, or they may reflect errors which occurred during the construction or cloning of the cDNA. Two other differences in nucleotide sequence suggest differences in the processing of precursor mRNAs. One difference involves the deletion of three nucleotides from the coding sequence of one of the clones. This probably reflects the use of alternate splicing sites at intron-exon boundaries. The other likely processing difference is reflected by the fact that one of the clones contains a much longer 3' untranslated region than the other clones. This difference probably arose due to a single nucleotide difference leading to selection of an alternate polyadenylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1537591012,"The nutritional regulation of rat liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was studied using a cloned DNA complementary to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. The recombinant cDNA clones were isolated from a double-stranded cDNA library constructed from poly(A+) RNA immunoenriched for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Immunoenrichment was accomplished by adsorption of polysomes with antibodies directed against glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in conjunction with protein A-Sepharose and oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Poly(A+) RNA encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was enriched approximately 20,000-fold using these procedures. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the immunoenriched poly(A+) RNA and inserted into pBR322 using poly(dC)-poly(dG) tailing. Escherichia coli MC1061 was transformed, and colonies were screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA sequences by differential colony hybridization. Plasmid DNA was purified from clones which gave positive signals, and the identity of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase clones was verified by hybrid-selected translation. A collection of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA plasmids with overlapping restriction maps was obtained. Northern blot analysis of rat liver poly(A+) RNA using nick-translated, 32P-labeled cDNA inserts revealed that the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA is 2.3 kilobases in length. RNA blot analysis showed that refeeding fasted rats a high carbohydrate diet results in a 13-fold increase in the amount of hybridizable hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA which parallels the increase in enzyme activity. These results suggest that the nutritional regulation of hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase occurs at a pretranslational level."

https://openalex.org/W1523088140,"Abstract Cultures of newborn rat heart myocytes undergo major age-related alterations as demonstrated by comparing 5-6-day-old cells (young cells) and 14-15-day-old cells (old cells). This includes: changes from spherical to elongated shape; sphingomyelin and cholesterol level/cell increase by 100% and 50%, respectively, while the phosphatidylcholine is reduced by 15-20% with almost no change in content of total phospholipids. There is a 50% increase in total protein content/cell while DNA content remain constant. The specific activity of seven marker enzymes representing most subcellular organelles is increased. Beating rate is reduced from 160 +/- 20 to 20 +/- 20 beats min-1. All the above age-dependent alterations are affected by modification of cellular polar lipid composition. Small unilamellar vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine added to the growth medium of old cells serve as donor of egg phosphatidylcholine to the cells and as acceptor of cellular sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Sphingomyelin-phospholipid exchange can be separated from cholesterol depletion either by using vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol mixtures which serve only in the phospholipid exchange process, or by small unilamellar vesicles of sphingomyelin which act only as efficient cholesterol acceptors. Such experiments indicated that the major response of old cells is to alteration in the phosphatidylcholine to sphingomyelin mole ratio, while changes in the cholesterol level induce smaller effects. Thus, reversal of phosphatidylcholine to sphingomyelin mole ratio to the values shown by young cells reverse cellular functions and features which were altered by cell aging to levels found in young cells. This includes: increase in the beating rate back to 160 +/- 20, reduction in the total protein level and in the specific activity per DNA content of seven marker enzymes and reappearance of spherical cell shape. These results suggest that membrane lipid composition has major influence on cellular properties which as described in the accompanying paper (Yechiel, E., Barenholz, Y., and Henis, Y. I. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9132-9136), may be mediated through the organization and dynamics of the cell membranes."

We show that essentially full-length cDNA clones for human ferritin H and L chains do not cross-hybridize under moderate stringency conditions and present the first comparisons of H and L mRNAs and genes from the same species. Northern blot analyses indicate that the H and L mRNAs each contain about 1100 nucleotides. Subprobe analyses of Southern blots show that both H and L genes exist as multiple gene families. Both the 5' and 3' sequences of the H genes are heterogeneous, whereas the 3' end of the L gene is relatively conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1537426183,"Three unique bilin peptides, a beta subunit peptide bearing a doubly linked phycourobilin (PUB), and two gamma subunit peptides with singly linked PUB groups, were obtained by enzymatic degradation of Gastroclonium coulteri R-phycoerythrin. These peptides were shown to have the sequences (Klotz, A. V., and Glazer, A. N. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4856-4863): (Formula: see text) The sequence of peptide beta-3T was identical to that previously established for a doubly linked phycoerythrobilin (PEB) peptide derived from a B-phycoerythrin (Lundell, D. J., Glazer, A. N., DeLange, R. J., and Brown, D. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5472-5480). Secondary ion mass spectrometry of beta-3T yielded a protonated molecular ion of 1629 mass units, the same as that given by the doubly linked PEB peptide (Schoenleber, R. W., Lundell, D. J., Glazer, A. N., and Rapoport, H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5481-5484), indicating that the doubly linked PUB and PEB tetrapyrroles were isomeric structures. High resolution 1H NMR analyses of peptides beta-3T, gamma-BV8, and gamma-DP provided unambiguous structural assignments for the singly and doubly linked PUB chromophores and indicated that the peptides in gamma-BV8 and gamma-DP were linked to ring A. The determination of which peptide fragment is linked to ring A and which to ring D in peptide beta-3T was not achieved in this study. 1H NMR analyses of three PEB-peptides from G. coulteri R-phycoerythrin--alpha-1 Cys(PEB)-Tyr-Arg, alpha-2 Leu-Cys(PEB)-Val-Pro-Arg, and beta-1 Met-Ala-Ala-Cys(PEB)-Leu-Arg--showed that they were identical to previously described corresponding chromopeptides from Porphyridium cruentum B-phycoerythrin, with the peptide linked to ring A of PEB in each instance (Schoenleber, R. W., Lundell, D. J., Glazer, A. N., and Rapoport, H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5485-5489). This is the first documented report on the structure of singly or doubly linked phycourobilins."
https://openalex.org/W2052774560,"The T-cell antigen receptor is a cell surface molecule vital in mediating the cellular immune response. The arrangement and rearrangement of the gene segments encoding the beta-chain polypeptide of the receptor are similar to those of immunoglobulin gene segments. The two constant region genes of the human T-cell antigen receptor are 8 kilobases apart with a cluster of joining segments located 5' of each constant region gene. Although most beta-chain gene rearrangements involve the variable, diversity, and joining segments, analysis of a beta-chain complementary DNA clone suggests the occasional occurrence of another type of rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1496429631,"The proteolytic susceptibility of chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase, a calmodulin-dependent enzyme, has been utilized to define the relative location of the catalytic and regulatory domains of the enzyme. Myosin light chain kinase isolated from this source exhibits a Mr of 130,000 and is extremely sensitive to trypsin at 24 degrees C; however, the molecule is divided into susceptible and resistant domains such that proteolysis proceeds rapidly and at multiple sites in the sensitive regions even at 4 degrees C while the rest of the molecule remains relatively resistant to digestion. One of these sensitive areas is the calmodulin-binding domain. On the other hand, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion generates a calmodulin-binding fragment (Mr = 70,000) that retains Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymatic activity and both of the phosphorylation sites recognized by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In contrast, treatment with chymotrypsin produces a 95,000 Mr calmodulin-binding fragment that contains only the calmodulin-modulated phosphorylation site. Sequential proteolytic digestion studies demonstrated that the chymotryptic cleavage site responsible for the generation of this 95,000 Mr peptide is within 3,000 Mr of the V8 protease site which produces the 70,000 Mr fragment. Moreover, the non-calmodulin-modulated phosphorylation site must exist in this 3,000 Mr region. A calmodulin-Sepharose affinity adsorption protocol was developed for the digestion and used to isolate both the 70,000 and 95,000 Mr fragments for further study. Taken together, our results are compatible with a model for chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase in which there is no overlap between the active site, the calmodulin-binding region, and the two sites phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase with regard to their relative position in the primary sequence of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1535367923,"Abstract The multifunctional protein uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) synthase catalyzes the final two reactions of the de novo biosynthesis of UMP in mammalian cells by the sequential action of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23). This protein is composed of one or two identical subunits; the monomer weighs of 51,500 daltons. UMP synthase from mouse Ehrlich ascites cells can exist as three distinct species as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation: a 3.6 S monomer, a 5.1 S dimer, and a 5.6 S conformationally altered dimer. Limited digestion of each of these three species with trypsin produced a 28,500-dalton peptide that was relatively resistant to further proteolysis. The peptide appears to be one of the two enzyme domains of UMP synthase for it retained only OMP decarboxylase activity. Similar results were obtained when UMP synthase was digested with elastase. OMP decarboxylase activity was less stable for the domain than for UMP synthase; the domain can rapidly lose activity upon storage or upon dilution. The size of the mammalian OMP decarboxylase domain is similar to that of yeast OMP decarboxylase. If the polypeptides which are cleaved from UMP synthase by trypsin are derived exclusively from either the amino or the carboxyl end of UMP synthase, then the size of a fragment possessing the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase domain could be as large as 23,000 daltons which is similar in size to the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase of yeast and of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1590469538,"We have used the photoaffinity analogs 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-N3ATP) and 8-azidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-N3GTP) to investigate the relationship between a viral induced protein (Mr = 120,000) in tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-infected tobacco and the TMV-induced RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. When the radioactive analogs [gamma-32P]8-N3ATP and [gamma-32P]8-N3GTP were incubated with the tobacco tissue homogenate from TMV-infected plants, incorporation of label occurred into the viral induced protein in the presence of UV light. The incorporation was found to be totally dependent on UV-illumination and greatly enhanced by Mg2+. Saturation of photoincorporated label indicates an apparent Kd of 16 microM (+/- 3 microM) and 12 microM (+/- 3 microM) for 8-N3ATP and 8-N3GTP, respectively. Protection against photolabeling by [gamma-32P]8-N3ATP and [gamma-32P]8-N3GTP with various nonradioactive nucleotides and nucleosides suggests that the photolabeled site is protected best by nucleoside triphosphates. At 200 microM both deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and ribonucleoside triphosphates were very effective at protecting the site from photolabeling. These data suggest that the photolabeled protein may be part of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The utility of nucleotide photoaffinity analogs as a method to study viral induced nucleotide-binding proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1600680299,"Protein C was purified from the plasma of a cow treated with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin. The purified protein appeared not to bind Ca2+ ions in contrast to protein C from an untreated animal. The gamma-carboxyglutamic acid content of the abnormal protein C was reduced to approximately 10% of normal, whereas the beta-hydroxyaspartic acid content was only slightly decreased, suggesting that vitamin K is not involved in the postribosomal hydroxylation of the aspartic acid residue in position 71 of the light chain of protein C. The abnormal and normal proteins were activated at the same rates by thrombin, but normal protein C was more rapidly activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Compared to normal protein C, the abnormal one had virtually no anticoagulant activity."
https://openalex.org/W1598677347,"The striking changes in amount of rat liver SCP (sterol carrier protein) during a 24-h dark-light cycle are due to alterations in the relative synthetic rate of SCP. However, functional SCP mRNA, measured by a cell-free translational assay, does not fluctuate in the dark-light cycle. Since cell-free translational assays do not always reflect the actual abundance of an mRNA molecule, a specific cDNA hybridization assay was used to directly quantitate SCP mRNA sequences. The cDNA probe was selected from a rat liver library by hybridization to a mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides containing a portion of the sequence of SCP mRNA. The relative amount and size distribution of the SCP mRNA species (approximately 700-800 nucleotides) does not change during the diurnal cycle. To explore possible mechanisms of this translational control, the polysomal distribution of SCP mRNA was compared at the maximum and minimum points of SCP synthesis. No significant amounts of SCP mRNA were present in nonpolysomal ribonucleoprotein particles. Furthermore, no alteration in the relative level of SCP mRNA associated with polysomes or in polysome size occurs at the maximum and minimum points of SCP synthesis. Thus, changes in total SCP mRNA levels or its polysomal distribution cannot account for the diurnal variation in SCP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1909694675,"Rat liver cytosol contains a heat-labile macromolecule that inhibits the binding of the transformed glucocorticoid-receptor complex to nuclei or DNA-cellulose (Milgrom, E., and Atger, M. (1975) J. Steroid Biochem. 6, 487-492; Simons, S. S., Jr., Martinez, H. M., Garcea, R. L., Baxter, J. D., and Tomkins, G. M. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 334-343. We have developed a quantitative assay for the inhibitor and have purified it 600-700-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ethanol precipitation, and phosphocellulose and Sephacryl S-300 chromatography. The inhibitory activity copurifies with a Mr = 37,000 protein doublet. Under low salt conditions, both the inhibitory activity and the 37-kDa protein doublet behave as high Mr aggregates that subsequently dissociate in the presence of salt. The inhibitor is positively charged at physiological pH, and it is not affected by digestion with several serine proteases or RNase. The inhibitor does not affect the transformation process, and it does not cause the release of steroid-receptor complexes that have been prebound to DNA-cellulose. The inhibitor preparation does not cleave receptors in L-cell cytosol that are covalently labeled with the site-specific affinity steroid [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate. If the steroid-receptor complex is first separated from the great majority of cytosol protein by transforming it and binding it to DNA-cellulose, addition of the inhibitor preparation results in receptor cleavage. Under these conditions, cleavage can be blocked with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-L-2-heptanone and antipain, but protease inhibitors do not affect the inhibition of DNA binding that occurs in whole cytosol. The inhibitor acts through an interaction with the receptor, not with DNA. We suggest that the inhibitor may prove to be a useful tool for studying the interaction of the steroid-receptor complex with DNA or nuclei and speculate that it may be important in determining normal events of the receptor cycle as they occur in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W1551076345,"The binding of Tb3+ to bovine prothrombin and the amino-terminal 156 residues of prothrombin (F-1) was studied. On the basis of various Tb3+ emission properties, three classes of Tb3+-binding sites were described. The first class contained three high affinity sites in the F-1 region. These sites were filled noncooperatively and were saturated with Tb3+ before the other classes of sites started to fill. Ho3+ quenching of Tb3+ emission showed that these sites were in close proximity to one another (estimated distances 6-12 A). The second class of sites contained three lower affinity sites, also in the F-1 region. These sites bound Tb3+ in a stoichiometric manner and saturated prior to metal binding to the final class of sites. The number of protein ligands binding Tb3+ in the high affinity sites decreased as this second set of sites was filled. Ho3+ quenching of Tb3+ emission suggested that these sites were closely spaced and/or close to the first set of sites. The third class of sites contained 4-6 low affinity sites unique to prothrombin (not in the F-1 region). These sites were not studied extensively, but Tb3+ did not appear to bind stoichiometrically and did not saturate these sites in a manner similar to the other two classes of sites. The emission properties of Tb3+ bound to F-1 were different in KCl versus NaCl containing buffer while the emission properties of Tb3+ bound to prothrombin were not. Optimum conditions for studying lanthanide binding to F-1 (i.e. when Tb3+ bound to F-1 showed emission properties similar to Tb3+ bound to prothrombin) were when F-1 experiments were done at low F-1 concentrations in buffer containing 0.1 M KCl."
https://openalex.org/W1531012720,"The structure of prothrombin fragment 1 has been determined at 3.5-A resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement methods with four heavy atom derivatives. The final average figure of merit is 0.72. There is a large cylindrical solvent region with an average diameter of 35-40 A along the entire length of the c axis (85 A) centered at about x = y = 1/2. The connected density forming the wall of this channel is not of sufficient extent to account for the 156 residues of fragment 1 and the two accompanying carbohydrate chains totaling 5000 in molecular weight. Deglycosylated fragment 1 crystallizes isomorphously with fragment 1, and a difference map between the two revealed that the sugar chains are severely disordered and reside in the solvent channel. Although the disordered carbohydrate and the complexity of five disulfides in a 126-residue sequence have hampered the complete tracing of the peptide chain, two-thirds of the molecule has been accounted for in the form of an unusually oblate ellipsoid of about 15 X 30 X 35 A. The folding of the molecule has little secondary structure (one alpha-helix (7%), 20% beta-structure) in agreement with dichroism measurements and one of the points of carbohydrate attachment is suggested from the deglycosylated difference map."
https://openalex.org/W1542015203,"Two-dimensional electrophoresis together with radiolabeling experiments was used to examine cytosolic proteins of embryonic chick duodenum for responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 caused a striking decrease in [3H]leucine content of an 18,000-dalton protein (approximate pI, 5.1) after a 10-min pulse with radioisotope followed by a 4-h chase. Decreased [14C]leucine content of the same protein was also observed at various times following 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 addition to culture media; a significant decrease in radiolabel incorporation occurred within 30 min after addition of the hormone. The results argue that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 causes either a decreased synthesis rate or a post-translational modification of this protein. This change joins the biosynthesis of calcium-binding protein as an early event in the response of chick embryonic intestine to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3."
https://openalex.org/W1515683019,"The effects of arsenite on the reaction of reduced xanthine oxidase with oxygen are determined. The kinetics of the reaction monitoring the return of enzyme absorbance are investigated as are the kinetics and stoichiometries of peroxide and superoxide formation. Although some of the effects of arsenite are qualitatively consistent with expectations based on the known perturbation of the molybdenum midpoint potentials by arsenite, several results cannot be so easily explained. Specifically, arsenite introduces a very rapid phase (kobs = 110 s-1 at 125 microM oxygen) to the oxidative half-reaction which is not observed with the native enzyme. Arsenite also diminishes the amount of superoxide produced and eliminates one-electron reduced enzyme as a detectable kinetic intermediate in the reoxidation pathway. These differences appear to result from the ability of arsenite to greatly enhance the oxygen- and/or superoxide-reactivity of the reduced molybdenum center. This is reflected in the observation that reduced forms of arsenite-complexed xanthine oxidase lacking functional FAD (iodoacetamide-alkylated enzyme and deflavo enzyme) react relatively rapidly with oxygen whereas these reactions are quite slow in the absence of arsenite."
