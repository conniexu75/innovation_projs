https://openalex.org/W2057805880,"As harvesting effort and yield are increased, animal populations that are being harvested for sustained yield will take longer to recover from environmentally imposed disturbances. One consequence is that the coefficient of variation (the relative variance) of the yield increases as the point of maximum sustained yield (MSY) is approached. When overexploitation has resulted in a population smaller than that for MSY, high effort produces a low average yield with high variance. These observations accord with observed trends in several fish and whaling industries. We expect these effects to be more pronounced for a harvesting strategy based on constant quotas than for one based on constant effort. Although developed in a MSY context, the conclusions also apply if the aim is to maximize the present value of (discounted) net economic revenue."
https://openalex.org/W2082075077,"New oocytes are generated throughout long lives in butterflies of the genus Heliconius, which as adults feed on amino acids from pollen. In Dryas julia, a related heliconiine that feeds only on nectar and is relatively short-lived, the original oocyte supply is eventually depleted. Such divergent ovarian dynamics in closely related organisms are significant in terms of both their evolutionary basis and their physiological controls."
https://openalex.org/W2075109737,"Neuroendocrine (bag cell) control of egg laying was studied in freely behaving Aplysia. Surgical lesions showed that bag cells are not necessary for egg laying, although they play a crucial role in its control, and that the pleurovisceral connectives are the afferent pathway to the bag cells. Recording in vivo showed that synchronous bag cell spikes progressively invade the network, leading to prolonged repetitive firing that initiates natural egg laying."

For frequencies between 1 and 5 kilohertz, the specific attenuation factor, Q, for sand is 18. Compound slit sensilla on basitarsal leg segments of sand-dwelling scorpions respond to surface waves generated by movements of insects as far as 50 centimeters away, and tarsal sensory hairs respond to higher-frequency (mostly compressional-wave) components of the signal."
https://openalex.org/W2026357715,"A spill of fuel oil at West Falmouth, Massachusetts, in 1969, contaminated contiguous salt marshes with up to 6000 micrograms of oil per gram (ppm) of wet mud and affected local populations of Uca pugnax. Directly related to high-sediment oil content were reduced crab density, reduced ratio of females to males, reduced juvenile settlement, heavy overwinter mortality, incorporation of oil into body tissues, behavioral disorders such as locomotor impairment, and abnormal burrow construction. Concentrations of weathered fuel oil greater than 1000 ppm were directly toxic to adults, while those of 100 to 200 ppm were toxic to juveniles. Cumulative effects occurred at lower concentrations. Recovery of the marsh from this relatively small oil spill is still incomplete after 7 years."

https://openalex.org/W2085741238,"IQ's between 3 and 18 years of age were used to predict attained education and occupational status after 26 years of age. By the second grade these predictive correlations approached those that have been obtained with contemporaneous adult IQ's, especially for occupational status. However, they were not high enough for practical purposes requiring long-term prediction for individual normal children."
https://openalex.org/W2075526348,"Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations of an experimentally shock-deformed single crystal of natural peridot, (Mg0.88Fe0.12)2SiO4, recovered from peak pressures of about 56 × 109 pascals revealed the presence of amorphous zones located within crystalline regions with a high density of tangled dislocations. This is the first reported observation of olivine glass. The shocked sample exhibits a wide variation in the degree of shock deformation on a small scale, and the glass appears to be intimately associated with the highest density of dislocations. This study suggests that olivine glass may be formed as a result of shock at pressures above about 50 to 55 × 109 pascals and that further TEM observations of naturally shocked olivines may demonstrate the presence of glass."
https://openalex.org/W2066513559,The results of two of the three biology experiments carried out on the Viking Mars landers have been simulated. The mixture of organic compounds labeled with carbon-14 used on Mars released carbon dioxide containing carbon-14 when reacted with a simulated martian surface and atmosphere exposed to ultraviolet light (labeled release experiment). Oxygen was released when metal peroxides or superoxides were treated with water (gas exchange experiment). The simulations suggest that the results of these two Viking experiments can be explained on the basis of reactions of the martian surface and atmosphere.
https://openalex.org/W2080176590,"Larvae of two pine sawflies, Neodiprion rugifrons Midd. and Neodiprion swainei Midd., consume only old foliage of jack pine, Pinus banksiana Lamb., and leave juvenile foliage intact early in the growing season. The chemical basis for this unique adaptation is a feeding deterrent chemical, 13-keto-8(14)-podocarpen-18-oic acid, which was isolated from juvenile foliage. The content of this deterrent chemical decreases as the foliage begins to mature until needles become acceptable to Neodiprion swainei larvae by August (60-day-old foliage) and to second-generation Neodiprion rugifrons by September (90-day-old foliage). The precise timing of larval acceptance of juvenile foliage indicates a highly specific relationship between these insects and their host tree based on the composition of chemicals in the foliage."
https://openalex.org/W2035545234,"The average potassium oxide content of 18 Paleozoic two-layer monoclinic illites is 8.75 percent. There is an excellent linear relation between the ratio of the intensities of the reflections at 10 angstroms and 5 angstroms (10 A/5 A) and the potassium oxide content. The frequency distribution curve of the 10 A/5 A intensity ratio of 249 Paleozoic illite-rich shales is approximately normal. The modal value is 2.0, equivalent to 9.3 percent potassium oxide, and the average ratio is 2.47, equivalent to approximately 8.5 percent potassium oxide. The illite layers of many of the mixed layer illites-montmorillonites have from 8 to 10 percent potassium oxide. With a minimum number of assumptions realistic structural formulas for the two members of a mixed-layer illite-montmorillonite can be calculated."
https://openalex.org/W2014702811,"Both casein and yeast hydrolysate contain feeding stimulants for the adult female house fly. Guanosine monophosphate is the major active component in yeast hydrolysate. Several amino acids, including leucine, methionine, lysine, and isoleucine, are also effective feeding stimulants and are presumed to be the active components in the casein hydrolysate. Solution in phosphate buffer is necessary in all instances to obtain maximum activity with the stimulants."

It extends through northeastern Keewatin, Melville Peninsula, and Baffin Island and marks the border of a late-Wisconsin ice sheet centered over Foxe Basin and Hudson Bay 8000 or 9000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2083138724,The packing position of a molecule of known or assumed dimensions in a crystal can be found by minimizing the energy of the crystal with respect to molecular position by the method of steepest descent. Molecular flexibility can be introduced by allowing internal rotation about selected bonds. The method can be used to solve the diffraction phase problem in appropriate cases.

https://openalex.org/W2094034448,Postreproductive Cnemidophorus uniparens maintained under free-running conditions of constant darkness for 7 months became reproductive at the same time as controls exposed to a long photoperiod. This lizard exhibits a pause in reproductive activity (refractory period) commencing in late summer in nature and terminating in mid-December in captivity. Both groups terminated refractoriness and started reproducing simultaneously in December despite maintenance of the experimental group in darkness since September. These results confirm the hypothesis that the refractory period in this lizard is under endogenous control.

https://openalex.org/W2041579358,"The first series of radiocarbon dates to be obtained from a deep shaft-and-chamber tomb of the type restricted in Mesoamerica to parts of Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima in western Mexico ranges from 2230 +/- 100 years to 1710 +/- 80 years. Examination of the evidence indicates that for the present a date equivalent to A.D. 250 should be accepted for at least one phase, possibly a late phase, of the shaft tomb culture and for the hollow, polychrome figurines associated with the tombs."
