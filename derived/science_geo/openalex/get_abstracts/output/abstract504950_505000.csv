https://openalex.org/W2039521726,"Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels. Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2064397275,"We present primary results from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project, coordinated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Examining Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls, we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for junction discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions, with >80% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and variation is large for transcript-level profiling. The complete SEQC data sets, comprising >100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings."
https://openalex.org/W1989996002,"The concordance of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) with microarrays for genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression has not been rigorously assessed using a range of chemical treatment conditions. Here we use a comprehensive study design to generate Illumina RNA-seq and Affymetrix microarray data from the same liver samples of rats exposed in triplicate to varying degrees of perturbation by 27 chemicals representing multiple modes of action (MOAs). The cross-platform concordance in terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched pathways is linearly correlated with treatment effect size (R(2)0.8). Furthermore, the concordance is also affected by transcript abundance and biological complexity of the MOA. RNA-seq outperforms microarray (93% versus 75%) in DEG verification as assessed by quantitative PCR, with the gain mainly due to its improved accuracy for low-abundance transcripts. Nonetheless, classifiers to predict MOAs perform similarly when developed using data from either platform. Therefore, the endpoint studied and its biological complexity, transcript abundance and the genomic application are important factors in transcriptomic research and for clinical and regulatory decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2006028524,"Cardiac development arises from two sources of mesoderm progenitors, the first heart field (FHF) and the second (SHF). Mesp1 has been proposed to mark the most primitive multipotent cardiac progenitors common for both heart fields. Here, using clonal analysis of the earliest prospective cardiovascular progenitors in a temporally controlled manner during early gastrulation, we found that Mesp1 progenitors consist of two temporally distinct pools of progenitors restricted to either the FHF or the SHF. FHF progenitors were unipotent, whereas SHF progenitors were either unipotent or bipotent. Microarray and single-cell PCR with reverse transcription analysis of Mesp1 progenitors revealed the existence of molecularly distinct populations of Mesp1 progenitors, consistent with their lineage and regional contribution. Together, these results provide evidence that heart development arises from distinct populations of unipotent and bipotent cardiac progenitors that independently express Mesp1 at different time points during their specification, revealing that the regional segregation and lineage restriction of cardiac progenitors occur very early during gastrulation."

As an alternative production strategy, we developed baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a microbial host for the transformation of opiates. Yeast strains engineered to express heterologous genes from P. somniferum and bacterium Pseudomonas putida M10 convert thebaine to codeine, morphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone and oxycodone. We discovered a new biosynthetic branch to neopine and neomorphine, which diverted pathway flux from morphine and other target products. We optimized strain titer and specificity by titrating gene copy number, enhancing cosubstrate supply, applying a spatial engineering strategy and performing high-density fermentation, which resulted in total opioid titers up to 131 mg/l. This work is an important step toward total biosynthesis of valuable benzylisoquinoline alkaloid drug molecules and demonstrates the potential for developing a sustainable and secure yeast biomanufacturing platform for opioids."
https://openalex.org/W2073380432,"High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) greatly expands the potential for genomics discoveries, but the wide variety of platforms, protocols and performance capabilitites has created the need for comprehensive reference data. Here we describe the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities next-generation sequencing (ABRF-NGS) study on RNA-seq. We carried out replicate experiments across 15 laboratory sites using reference RNA standards to test four protocols (poly-A-selected, ribo-depleted, size-selected and degraded) on five sequencing platforms (Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies PGM and Proton, Pacific Biosciences RS and Roche 454). The results show high intraplatform (Spearman rank R > 0.86) and inter-platform (R > 0.83) concordance for expression measures across the deep-count platforms, but highly variable efficiency and cost for splice junction and variant detection between all platforms. For intact RNA, gene expression profiles from rRNA-depletion and poly-A enrichment are similar. In addition, rRNA depletion enables effective analysis of degraded RNA samples. This study provides a broad foundation for cross-platform standardization, evaluation and improvement of RNA-seq."

https://openalex.org/W2030677229,"High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables comprehensive scans of entire transcriptomes, but best practices for analyzing RNA-seq data have not been fully defined, particularly for data collected with multiple sequencing platforms or at multiple sites. Here we used standardized RNA samples with built-in controls to examine sources of error in large-scale RNA-seq studies and their impact on the detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Analysis of variations in guanine-cytosine content, gene coverage, sequencing error rate and insert size allowed identification of decreased reproducibility across sites. Moreover, commonly used methods for normalization (cqn, EDASeq, RUV2, sva, PEER) varied in their ability to remove these systematic biases, depending on sample complexity and initial data quality. Normalization methods that combine data from genes across sites are strongly recommended to identify and remove site-specific effects and can substantially improve RNA-seq studies."

https://openalex.org/W2037572029,"A central goal of regenerative medicine is to generate transplantable organs from cells derived or expanded in vitro. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the production of defined cell types in vitro, the creation of a fully intact organ has not been reported. The transcription factor forkhead box N1 (FOXN1) is critically required for development of thymic epithelial cells (TECs), a key cell type of the thymic stroma. Here, we show that enforced Foxn1 expression is sufficient to reprogramme fibroblasts into functional TECs, an unrelated cell type across a germ-layer boundary. These FOXN1-induced TECs (iTECs) supported efficient development of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in vitro. On transplantation, iTECs established a complete, fully organized and functional thymus, that contained all of the TEC subtypes required to support T-cell differentiation and populated the recipient immune system with T cells. iTECs thus demonstrate that cellular reprogramming approaches can be used to generate an entire organ, and open the possibility of widespread use of thymus transplantation to boost immune function in patients."

https://openalex.org/W2050610277,"We tested the sensory impact of repeated synchronization of fast-spiking interneurons (FS), an activity pattern thought to underlie neocortical gamma oscillations. We optogenetically drove 'FS-gamma' while mice detected naturalistic vibrissal stimuli and found enhanced detection of less salient stimuli and impaired detection of more salient ones. Prior studies have predicted that the benefit of FS-gamma is generated when sensory neocortical excitation arrives in a specific temporal window 20-25 ms after FS synchronization. To systematically test this prediction, we aligned periodic tactile and optogenetic stimulation. We found that the detection of less salient stimuli was improved only when peripheral drive led to the arrival of excitation 20-25 ms after synchronization and that other temporal alignments either had no effects or impaired detection. These results provide causal evidence that FS-gamma can enhance processing of less salient stimuli, those that benefit from the allocation of attention."
https://openalex.org/W2048708798,"Sox10 and Nuclear Factor I-A (NFIA) are transcriptional regulators of oligodendrocyte and astrocyte generation in the mammalian brain, respectively. This study describes reciprocal antagonism between these transcription factors whereby NFIA directly antagonizes Sox10 regulation of myelin gene expression in oligodendrocytes, and Sox10 negatively regulates NFIA during astrocyte differentiation. The work also demonstrates this mutual antagonism being involved in tumorigenesis, particularly during oligodendroglioma to astrocytoma conversion. Lineage progression and diversification is regulated by the coordinated action of unique sets of transcription factors. Oligodendrocytes (OL) and astrocytes (AS) comprise the glial sub-lineages in the CNS, and the manner in which their associated regulatory factors orchestrate lineage diversification during development and disease remains an open question. Sox10 and NFIA are key transcriptional regulators of gliogenesis associated with OL and AS. We found that NFIA inhibited Sox10 induction of OL differentiation through direct association and antagonism of its function. Conversely, we found that Sox10 antagonized NFIA function and suppressed AS differentiation in mouse and chick systems. Using this developmental paradigm as a model for glioma, we found that this relationship similarly regulated the generation of glioma subtypes. Our results describe the antagonistic relationship between Sox10 and NFIA that regulates the balance of OL and AS fate during development and demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the transcriptional processes governing glial sub-lineage diversification oversee the generation of glioma subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2033159826,"The ability to examine all chromatids from a single meiosis in yeast tetrads has been indispensable for defining the mechanisms of homologous recombination initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Using a broadly applicable strategy for the analysis of chromatids from a single meiosis at two recombination hotspots in mouse oocytes and spermatocytes, we demonstrate here the unidirectional transfer of information-gene conversion-in both crossovers and noncrossovers. Whereas gene conversion in crossovers is associated with reciprocal exchange, the unbroken chromatid is not altered in noncrossover gene conversion events, providing strong evidence that noncrossovers arise from a distinct pathway. Gene conversion frequently spares the binding site of the hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9, with the result that erosion of the hotspot is slowed. Thus, mouse tetrad analysis demonstrates how unique aspects of mammalian recombination mechanisms shape hotspot evolutionary dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1976458700,"Astrocytic uptake of GABA through GABA transporters (GATs) is an important mechanism regulating excitatory/inhibitory balance in the nervous system; however, mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate GAT levels are undefined. We found that at mid-pupal stages the Drosophila melanogaster CNS neuropil was devoid of astrocyte membranes and synapses. Astrocyte membranes subsequently infiltrated the neuropil coordinately with synaptogenesis, and astrocyte ablation reduced synapse numbers by half, indicating that Drosophila astrocytes are pro-synaptogenic. Shortly after synapses formed in earnest, GAT was upregulated in astrocytes. Ablation or silencing of GABAergic neurons or disruption of metabotropic GABA receptor 1 and 2 (GABA(B)R1/2) signaling in astrocytes led to a decrease in astrocytic GAT. Notably, developmental depletion of astrocytic GABA(B)R1/2 signaling suppressed mechanosensory-induced seizure activity in mutants with hyperexcitable neurons. These data reveal that astrocytes actively modulate GAT expression via metabotropic GABA receptor signaling and highlight the importance of precise regulation of astrocytic GAT in modulation of seizure activity."
https://openalex.org/W2138351218,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, exhibits distinct molecular subtypes and cellular origins. Genetic alterations driving medulloblastoma initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Herein, we identify GNAS, encoding the G protein Gαs, as a potent tumor suppressor gene that, when expressed at low levels, defines a subset of aggressive Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven human medulloblastomas. Ablation of the single Gnas gene in anatomically distinct progenitors in mice is sufficient to induce Shh-associated medulloblastomas, which recapitulate their human counterparts. Gαs is highly enriched at the primary cilium of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling by regulating both the cAMP-dependent pathway and ciliary trafficking of Hedgehog pathway components. Elevation in levels of a Gαs effector, cAMP, effectively inhibits tumor cell proliferation and progression in Gnas-ablated mice. Thus, our gain- and loss-of-function studies identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function for Gαs that can be found consistently across Shh-group medulloblastomas of disparate cellular and anatomical origins, highlighting G protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue."

Here we show that a single archaeal protein, the homolog of the third subunit of the eukaryotic Elongator complex (Elp3), is able to catalyze the same reaction. The mechanism of action by Elp3 described here represents unprecedented chemistry performed on acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1996624560,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides valuable data for understanding the human mind and brain disorders, but in-scanner head motion introduces systematic and spurious biases. For example, differences in MRI measures (e.g., network strength, white matter integrity) between patient and control groups may be due to the differences in their head motion. To determine whether head motion is an important variable in itself, or just simply a confounding variable, we explored individual differences in psychological traits that may predispose some people to move more than others during an MRI scan. In the first two studies, we demonstrated in both children (N = 245) and adults (N = 581) that head motion, estimated from resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, was reliably correlated with impulsivity scores. Further, the difference in head motion between children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children was largely due to differences in impulsivity. Finally, in the third study, we confirmed the observation that the regression approach, which aims to deal with motion issues by regressing out motion in the group analysis, would underestimate the effect of interest. Taken together, the present findings provide empirical evidence that links in-scanner head motion to psychological traits."
https://openalex.org/W1978792584,"Rho-family GTPases govern distinct types of cell migration on different extracellular matrix proteins in tissue culture or three-dimensional (3D) matrices. We searched for mechanisms selectively regulating 3D cell migration in different matrix environments and discovered a form of Cdc42-RhoA crosstalk governing cell migration through a specific pair of GTPase activator and inhibitor molecules. We first identified βPix, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), as a specific regulator of migration in 3D collagen using an affinity-precipitation-based GEF screen. Knockdown of βPix specifically blocks cell migration in fibrillar collagen microenvironments, leading to hyperactive cellular protrusion accompanied by increased collagen matrix contraction. Live FRET imaging and RNAi knockdown linked this βPix knockdown phenotype to loss of polarized Cdc42 but not Rac1 activity, accompanied by enhanced, de-localized RhoA activity. Mechanistically, collagen phospho-regulates βPix, leading to its association with srGAP1, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), needed to suppress RhoA activity. Our results reveal a matrix-specific pathway controlling migration involving a GEF-GAP interaction of βPix with srGAP1 that is critical for maintaining suppressive crosstalk between Cdc42 and RhoA during 3D collagen migration."
https://openalex.org/W2074850044,"Soluble Amyloid-β oligomers (Aβo) can trigger Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology by binding to cell surface cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). PrP(C) interacts physically with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), and this interaction controls the transmission of neurotoxic signals to intracellular substrates. Because the interruption of the signal transduction from PrP(C) to mGluR5 has therapeutic potential for AD, we developed assays to explore the effect of endogenous ligands, agonists/antagonists, and antibodies on the interaction between PrP(C) and mGluR5 in cell lines and mouse brain. We show that the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153 mediates the interaction with mGluR5. Agonists of mGluR5 increase the mGluR5-PrP(C) interaction, whereas mGluR5 antagonists suppress protein association. Synthetic Aβo promotes the protein interaction in mouse brain and transfected HEK-293 cell membrane preparations. The interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is enhanced dramatically in the brains of familial AD transgenic model mice. In brain homogenates with Aβo, the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is reversed by mGluR5-directed antagonists or antibodies directed against the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153. Silent allosteric modulators of mGluR5 do not alter Glu or basal mGluR5 activity, but they disrupt the Aβo-induced interaction of mGluR5 with PrP(C). The assays described here have the potential to identify and develop new compounds that inhibit the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by transmitting the signal from extracellular Aβo into the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2088178427,"The main objectives of this study are estimate a species-dense, time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae, which together comprise a group of armoured catfishes that is widely distributed across South America, to place the origin of major clades in time and space, and to demonstrate the role of river capture on patterns of diversification in these taxa. We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to estimate a time-calibrated phylogeny of 115 loricariid species, using three mitochondrial and one nuclear genes to generate a matrix of 4,500 base pairs, and used parametric biogeographic analyses to estimate ancestral geographic ranges and to infer the effects of river capture events on the geographic distributions of these taxa. Our analysis recovered Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae as monophyletic with strong statistical support, and Neoplecostominae as more closely related to Otothyrinae than to Hypoptopomatinae. Our time-calibrated phylogeny and ancestral-area estimations indicate an origin of Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae during the Lower Eocene in the Atlantic Coastal Drainages, from which it is possible to infer several dispersal events to adjacent river basins during the Neogene. In conclusion we infer a strong influence of river capture in: (1) the accumulation of modern clade species-richness values; (2) the formation of the modern basin-wide species assemblages, and (3) the presence of many low-diversity, early-branching lineages restricted to the Atlantic Coastal Drainages. We further infer the importance of headwater stream capture and marine transgressions in shaping patterns in the distributions of Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae and Otothyrinae throughout South America."
https://openalex.org/W2052268049,"In the visual system, familiarization to an image results in reduced neural responses to it. Here the AUs find that with dynamic visual displays, neurons in the inferotemporal cortex respond more strongly to familiar than novel images. This indicates that familiarization sharpens the response dynamics of neurons in extrastriate visual cortex. Repeated viewing of an image over days and weeks induces a marked reduction in the strength with which neurons in monkey inferotemporal cortex respond to it. The processing advantage that attaches to this reduction is unknown. One possibility is that truncation of the response to a familiar image leaves neurons in a state of readiness to respond to ensuing images and thereby enhances their ability to track rapidly changing displays. We explored this possibility by assessing neuronal responses to familiar and novel images in rapid serial visual displays. Inferotemporal neurons responded more strongly to familiar than to novel images in such displays. The effect was stronger among putative inhibitory neurons than among putative excitatory neurons. A comparable effect occurred at the level of the scalp potential in humans. We conclude that long-term familiarization sharpens the response dynamics of neurons in both monkey and human extrastriate visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2045555205,"Hormone therapy with the selective estrogen-receptor modulator tamoxifen provides a temporary relief for patients with estrogen receptor α (ER)-positive breast cancers. However, a subset of patients exhibiting overexpression of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase displays intrinsic resistance to tamoxifen therapy. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms promoting the estrogen (E2)-independent ER-regulated gene transcription in tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors is essential to identify new therapeutic avenues to overcome drug resistance and ameliorate poor prognosis. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase, ACK1 (also known as TNK2), has emerged as a major integrator of signaling from various receptor tyrosine kinases including HER2. We have uncovered that heregulin-mediated ACK1 activation promoted ER activity in the presence of tamoxifen, which was significantly down-regulated upon ACK1 knockdown or inhibition of ACK1 by small molecule inhibitors, AIM-100 or Dasatinib. We report that ACK1 phosphorylates the ER co-activator, KDM3A, a H3K9 demethylase, at an evolutionary conserved tyrosine 1114 site in a heregulin-dependent manner, even in the presence of tamoxifen. Consistent with this finding, ACK1 activation resulted in a significant decrease in the deposition of dimethyl H3K9 epigenetic marks. Conversely, inhibition of ACK1 by AIM-100 or Dasatinib restored dimethyl H3K9 methylation marks and caused transcriptional suppression of the ER-regulated gene HOXA1. Thus, by its ability to regulate the epigenetic activity of an ER co-activator KDM3A, ACK1 modulates HOXA1 expression in the absence of E2, conferring tamoxifen resistance. These data reveal a novel therapeutic option, suppression of ACK1 signaling by AIM-100 or Dasatinib, to mitigate HOXA1 up-regulation in breast cancer patients displaying tamoxifen resistance.

The preponderance of ER expression in breast cancer cells and the dependence of cells on estrogen for growth has led to the successful use of tamoxifen in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer, which is able to diminish the breast cancer recurrence by almost 50% (4.Fisher B.

Although a majority of the breast tumors initially respond well to tamoxifen therapy, in about 15 months to 5 years, most women acquire tamoxifen resistance (6.Howell A. DeFriend D. Robertson J.

Despite intensive research efforts, the molecular mechanisms underlying tamoxifen resistance remain elusive. Various mechanisms such as mutations in ERα, the opposing transcriptional activity of ERβ, and amplification of the 6q25 genomic region encompassing the ER gene have been suggested to be involved in the acquisition of tamoxifen resistance (8.Johnston S.R.

Although elevated ER protein levels via amplification of the ERα gene, observed in ∼20% of breast cancers, may account for increased ER signaling, activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling such as EGFR and HER2 (neu/erbB2) by mutation or overexpression leading to ligand-independent ER hyperactivity may also be a causative factor in these breast cancers (11.Massarweh S. Schiff R. Unraveling the mechanisms of endocrine resistance in breast cancer: new therapeutic opportunities.Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For example, athymic mice injected with HER2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells developed resistance to tamoxifen rather quickly (∼8 weeks) as compared with MCF-7 tumors treated with tamoxifen or placebo pellets for 6 months of therapy (12.Gottardis M.M.

However, although Gefitinib, a selective EGFR kinase inhibitor, can only transiently reverse tamoxifen-resistant tumor growth, complete tumor regression is not observed (13.Shou J. Massarweh S.

Based on these data, we rationalized that breast cancer cells may have adapted to the tamoxifen-rich environment by aberrantly activating downstream signaling pathways, i.e. non-receptor tyrosine kinases that bypass blockade of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, neutralizing the effect of tamoxifen as an ER antagonist. Tamoxifen also acts as an agonist in experimentally engineered breast cancer cells with high levels of the HER2 growth factor receptor (13.Shou J. Massarweh S. Osborne C.K. Wakeling A.E. Ali S.

Taken together, these data raise the possibility that HER2 cross-talk with ER transcriptional complex, either directly or via an intermediate tyrosine kinase, could enhance the agonist activity of tamoxifen toward ER. Thus, it could be an alternate pathway of acquisition of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. However, the tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for stimulating ER-regulated gene expression in the presence of tamoxifen is not known. ACK1 is an ubiquitously expressed non-receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the processes of tumorigenesis, cancer cell survival, radiation resistance, and metastasis (15.Mahajan K.

Taken together, these recent data indicate that ACK1 has a critical role in breast cancer survival. However, its role in drug resistance remains poorly understood. Histone methylation, a dynamic posttranslational modification of arginine and lysine residues, plays a critical role in both gene activation and gene repression events in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions (28.Martin C. Zhang Y. The diverse functions of histone lysine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Methyl groups act as binding sites for a wide range of chromatin proteins, including the repressive heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which has been shown to bind methyl groups on histone H3 at lysine 9 or H3K9 (29.Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Rb targets histone H3 methylation and HP1 to promoters.Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). KDM3A (also known as JHDM2A or Jmjd1a) is a histone demethylase that catalyzes the removal of mono- and dimethyl H3K9 in a Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner (30.Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. JHDM2A, a JmjC-containing H3K9 demethylase, facilitates transcription activation by androgen receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). KDM3A contains an 885LXXLL889 sequence, which is a signature motif involved in nuclear hormone-receptor interaction (31.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. A signature motif in transcriptional co-activators mediates binding to nuclear receptors.Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Indeed, KDM3A interacted with the androgen receptor (AR), resulting in KDM3A recruitment to AR target genes, e.g. PSA and NKX3.1, causing demethylation of dimethyl H3K9 at PSA and NKX3.1 enhancers (30.Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. JHDM2A, a JmjC-containing H3K9 demethylase, facilitates transcription activation by androgen receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Thus, KDM3A is required for efficient demethylation of repressive dimethyl H3K9 at AR target genes promoting their transcriptional activation (30.Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. JHDM2A, a JmjC-containing H3K9 demethylase, facilitates transcription activation by androgen receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Further, it was demonstrated that KDM3A is essential for spermatogenesis, as KDM3A-deficient mice exhibited post-meiotic chromatin condensation defects (32.Okada Y. Scott G. Ray M.K. Mishina Y. Zhang Y. Histone demethylase JHDM2A is critical for Tnp1 and Prm1 transcription and spermatogenesis.Nature. 2007; 450: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and also obesity and hyperlipidemia (33.Tateishi K. Okada Y. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Role of Jhdm2a in regulating metabolic gene expression and obesity resistance.Nature. 2009; 458: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Generally, ER-tamoxifen functions as an efficient suppressor of ER·E2-regulated genes by recruiting corepressor complexes that include distinctive sets of chromatin-modifying histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, HDAC3-NCoR or the HDAC1-NuRD (34.Liu X.F. Bagchi M.K. Recruitment of distinct chromatin-modifying complexes by tamoxifen-complexed estrogen receptor at natural target gene promoters in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15050-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Conversely, ER-E2 complex recruits histone demethylases such as LSD1 and KDM3A to ER-regulated genes to activate gene transcription (30.Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y.

Histone methylation-dependent mechanisms impose ligand dependency for gene activation by nuclear receptors.Cell. 2007; 128: 505-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Further, whether histone demethylase activity is important for acquisition of tamoxifen resistance has not been explored. Unexpectedly, we observed that KDM3A but not LSD1 was Tyr-phosphorylated by ACK1 in tamoxifen-treated cells. 4K. Mahajan and N. P. Mahajan, unpublished data. Tyr-phosphorylated KDM3A promoted demethylation of dimethyl histone H3K9 at ACK1·ER-bound promoters to stimulate ER-regulated HOXA1 transcription. Our study therefore uncovers a novel ER coactivator, Tyr-phosphorylated KDM3A in potentiating ER-regulated gene HOXA1 transcription in the presence of tamoxifen. Thus, our data indicate that stimulating transcriptional activity of ER target genes by promoting epigenetic activity of KDM3A in the tamoxifen-rich environment could be one mechanism by which breast cancer cells could acquire tamoxifen resistance. T47D and MCF-7 cells were obtained from ATCC. ACK1 mAb (A11), α-tubulin (TU-O2), actin (I-19), ERα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and GeneTex), HRP-conjugated anti-pTyr (PY-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pTyr-284 ACK1 (Millipore), HER2 Ab-2 (Clone 9G6.10) (Thermo Scientific), and EGFR (Epitomics) antibodies were purchased from the respective companies.

ACK1-siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (D-003102-13 and D-003102-11). AIM-100 was made according to our published procedure (22.Mahajan K. Challa S. Coppola D. Lawrence H. Luo Y. Gevariya H. Zhu W.

Two KDM3A peptides coupled to immunogenic carrier proteins were synthesized. The phospho-peptide sequence is: Ac-TPEDRK[pY]GTTNLHLC-amide (where pY represents pTyr), whereas the non-phospho-peptide sequence is: Ac-CTPEDRKYGTTNLHL-amide. The antibodies were custom-generated by 21st Century Biochemicals. In brief, two rabbits were immunized twice with phospho-peptide, and ELISA was performed to determine the relative titer of sera against phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides. Two antigen affinity columns were used to purify the phospho-specific antibodies. The first column was the non-phospho-peptide affinity column. Antibodies recognizing the non-phospho-residues of the peptide bound to the column. The flow-through fraction was collected and then applied to the second column, the phospho-peptide column. Antibodies recognizing the phospho-residue bound to the column, which was eluted as phospho-specific antibodies. qRT-PCR was performed as described earlier (38.Mahajan K. Fang B. Koomen J.M. Mahajan N.P. H2B Tyr37 phosphorylation suppresses expression of replication-dependent core histone genes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, for the construction of standard curves, serial dilutions of pooled sample RNA were used (50, 10, 2, 0.4, 0.08, and 0.016 ng) per reverse transcriptase reaction. One “no RNA” control and one “no Reverse Transcriptase” (No RT) control were included for the standard curve. Three reactions were performed for each sample: 10 ng, 0.8 ng, and a No RT (10 ng) control. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses were performed using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). All standards, the no template control (H2O), the No RNA control, the no Reverse Transcriptase control, and the no amplification control (Bluescript plasmid), were tested in six wells per gene ((2 wells/plate and 3 plates/gene). PCR was carried out with SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) using 2 µl of cDNA and the primers in a 20-µl final reaction mixture. After a 2-min incubation at 50 °C, AmpliTaq Gold was activated by a 10-min incubation at 95 °C followed by 40 PCR cycles consisting of 15 s of denaturation at 95 °C and hybridization of primers for 1 min at 55 °C. Dissociation curves were generated for each plate to verify the integrity of the primers. Data were analyzed using SDS software version 2.2.2 and exported into an Excel spreadsheet. The actin data were used for normalizing the gene values: i.e. ng of gene/ng of actin per well. The primer sequences for HOXA1 are: forward primer, 5′-CGGAACTGGAGAAGGAGTTC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TTCACTTGGGTCTCGTTGAG-3′. The primer sequences for actin are: forward primer, 5′-CACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-AGGTCTTTGCGGATGTCCACGT-3′. HOXA1 primers were purchased from OriGene.

https://openalex.org/W2079201373,"Ribosome stalling during translation can be caused by a number of characterized mechanisms. However, the impact of elongation stalls on protein levels is variable, and the reasons for this are often unclear. To investigate this relationship, we examined the bacterial translation elongation factor P (EF-P), which plays a critical role in rescuing ribosomes stalled at specific amino acid sequences including polyproline motifs. In previous proteomic analyses of both Salmonella and Escherichia coli efp mutants, it was evident that not all proteins containing a polyproline motif were dependent on EF-P for efficient expression in vivo. The α- and β-subunits of ATP synthase, AtpA and AtpD, are translated from the same mRNA transcript, and both contain a PPG motif; however, proteomic analysis revealed that AtpD levels are strongly dependent on EF-P, whereas AtpA levels are independent of EF-P. Using these model proteins, we systematically determined that EF-P dependence is strongly influenced by elements in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA. By mutating either the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or the start codon, we find that EF-P dependence correlates directly with the rate of translation initiation where strongly expressed proteins show the greatest dependence on EF-P. Our findings demonstrate that polyproline-induced stalls exert a net effect on protein levels only if they limit translation significantly more than initiation. This model can be generalized to explain why sequences that induce pauses in translation elongation to, for example, facilitate folding do not necessarily exact a penalty on the overall production of the protein.

https://openalex.org/W1972390265,"Numerous studies have examined the genetic diversity and genetic structure of invading species, with contrasting results concerning the relative roles of genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity in the success of introduced populations. Increasing evidence shows that asexual lineages of aphids are able to occupy a wide geographical and ecological range of habitats despite low genetic diversity. The anholocyclic aphid Melanaphis sacchari is a pest of sugarcane and sorghum which originated in the old world, was introduced into the Americas, and is now distributed worldwide. Our purpose was to assess the genetic diversity and structuring of populations of this species according to host and locality. We used 10 microsatellite markers to genotype 1333 individuals (57 samples, 42 localities, 15 countries) collected mainly on sugarcane or sorghum. Five multilocus lineages (MLL) were defined, grouping multilocus genotypes (MLG) differing by only a few mutations or scoring errors. Analysis of a 658 bp sequence of mitochondrial COI gene on 96 individuals revealed five haplotypes, with a mean divergence of only 0.19 %. The distribution of MLL appeared to be strongly influenced by geography but not by host plant. Each of the five MLL grouped individuals from (A) Africa, (B) Australia, (C) South America, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean including East Africa, (D) USA, and (E) China. The MLL A and C, with a wide geographic distribution, matched the definition of superclone. Among aphids, M. sacchari has one of the lowest known rates of genetic diversity for such a wide geographical distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2046608695,"Microglia rapidly respond to CNS injury and disease and can assume a spectrum of activation states. While changes in gene expression and production of inflammatory mediators have been extensively described after classical (LPS-induced) and alternative (IL4-induced) microglial activation, less is known about acquired de-activation in response to IL10. It is important to understand how microglial activation states affect their migration and invasion; crucial functions after injury and in the developing CNS. We reported that LPS-treated rat microglia migrate very poorly, while IL4-treated cells migrate and invade much better. Having discovered that the lamellum of migrating microglia contains a large ring of podosomes – microscopic structures that are thought to mediate adhesion, migration and invasion – we hypothesized that IL4 and IL10 would differentially affect podosome expression, gene induction, migration and invasion. Further, based on the enrichment of the KCa2.3/SK3 Ca2+-activated potassium channel in microglial podosomes, we predicted that it regulates migration and invasion. We found both similarities and differences in gene induction by IL4 and IL10 and, while both cytokines increased migration and invasion, only IL10 affected podosome expression. KCa2.3 currents were recorded in microglia under all three activation conditions and KCNN3 (KCa2.3) expression was similar. Surprisingly then, of three KCa2.3 inhibitors (apamin, tamapin, NS8593), only NS8593 abrogated the increased migration and invasion of IL4 and IL10-treated microglia (and invasion of unstimulated microglia). This discrepancy was explained by the observed block of TRPM7 currents in microglia by NS8593, which occurred under all three activation conditions. A similar inhibition of both migration and invasion was seen with a TRPM7 inhibitor (AA-861) that does not block KCa2.3 channels. Thus, we conclude that TRPM7 (not KCa2.3) contributes to the enhanced ability of microglia to migrate and invade when in anti-inflammatory states. This will be an important consideration in developing TRPM7 inhibitors for treating CNS injury."
https://openalex.org/W2097088669,"Sorting nexins (SNXs) or phox homology (PX) domain containing proteins are central regulators of cell trafficking and signaling. A subfamily of PX domain proteins possesses two unique PX-associated domains, as well as a regulator of G protein-coupled receptor signaling (RGS) domain that attenuates Gαs-coupled G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Here we delineate the structural organization of these RGS-PX proteins, revealing a protein family with a modular architecture that is conserved in all eukaryotes. The one exception to this is mammalian SNX19, which lacks the typical RGS structure but preserves all other domains. The PX domain is a sensor of membrane phosphoinositide lipids and we find that specific sequence alterations in the PX domains of the mammalian RGS-PX proteins, SNX13, SNX14, SNX19, and SNX25, confer differential phosphoinositide binding preferences. Although SNX13 and SNX19 PX domains bind the early endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, SNX14 shows no membrane binding at all. Crystal structures of the SNX19 and SNX14 PX domains reveal key differences, with alterations in SNX14 leading to closure of the binding pocket to prevent phosphoinositide association. Our findings suggest a role for alternative membrane interactions in spatial control of RGS-PX proteins in cell signaling and trafficking."

Here, we designed THIK subunits containing dominant negative mutations (THIK1(DN) and THIK2(DN)). THIK2(DN) mutant inhibits THIK1 currents, whereas THIK1(DN) inhibits an activated form of THIK2 (THIK2-A155P-I158D). In situ proximity ligation assays and Förster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments support a physical association between THIK1 and THIK2. Next, we expressed covalent tandems of THIK proteins to obtain expression of pure heterodimers. Td-THIK1-THIK2 (where Td indicates tandem) produces K(+) currents of amplitude similar to Td-THIK1-THIK1 but with a noticeable difference in the current kinetics. Unlike Td-THIK2-THIK2 that is mainly detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, Td-THIK1-THIK2 distributes at the plasma membrane, indicating that THIK1 can mask the endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motif of THIK2. Kinetics and unitary conductance of Td-THIK1-THIK2 are intermediate between THIK1 and THIK2. Altogether, these results show that THIK1 and THIK2 form active heteromeric channels, further expanding the known repertoire of K(+) channels."
https://openalex.org/W2082671666,"Introduction Dietary patterns are culturally specific and there is limited data on the association of dietary patterns with late-life depression in Chinese. This study examined the associations between dietary patterns and baseline and subsequent depressive symptoms in community-dwelling Chinese older people in Hong Kong. Methods Participants aged ≥65 year participating in a cohort study examining the risk factors for osteoporosis completed a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline between 2001 and 2003. Factor analysis was used to identify three dietary patterns: “vegetables-fruits” pattern, “snacks-drinks-milk products” pattern, and “meat-fish” pattern. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and 4-year using the validated Geriatric Depression Scale. Multiple logistic regression was used for cross-sectional analysis (n = 2,902) to assess the associations between dietary patterns and the presence of depressive symptoms, and for longitudinal analysis (n = 2,211) on their associations with 4-year depressive symptoms, with adjustment for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors. Results The highest quartile of “vegetables-fruits” pattern score was associated with reduced likelihood of depressive symptoms [Adjusted OR = 0.55 (95% CI: 0.36–0.83), ptrend = 0.017] compared to the lowest quartile at baseline. Similar inverse trend was observed for the highest quartile of “snacks-drinks-milk products” pattern score [Adjusted OR = 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26–0.65), ptrend<0.001] compared to the lowest quartile. There was no association of “meat-fish” pattern with the presence of depressive symptoms at baseline. None of the dietary patterns were associated with subsequent depressive symptoms at 4-year. Conclusion Higher “vegetables-fruits” and “snacks-drinks-milk products” pattern scores were associated with reduced likelihood of baseline depressive symptoms in Chinese older people in Hong Kong. The longitudinal analyses failed to show any causal relationship between dietary patterns and depressive symptoms in this population."
https://openalex.org/W1967439924,"Circulating monocytes recruited to tissues can differentiate into macrophages and adopt unique gene expression programs in response to environmental cues. We recently described the regulated expression of several microRNAs (miRNAs) in polarized human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Basal expression of these activation-associated miRNAs was low in monocytes relative to MDMs. As development occurs in the context of specific cellular environments, we hypothesized that the rate of miRNA accumulation would be modified in the presence of microbial or cellular products during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Indeed, LPS treatment augmented the accumulation of miR-146a and miR-155, whereas IL-4 treatment augmented the accumulation of miR-193b and miR-222 during development. In contrast, some stimuli repressed accumulation of specific miRNAs including interferons (IFNs) (miR-27a, miR-125a-5p, and miR-222), IL-4 (miR-125a-5p), and LPS (miR-27a). RT-PCR-based expression profiling of monocytes differentiated with distinct methods showed that activation-associated miRNAs and markers of macrophage polarization were substantially altered in MDMs differentiated in the presence of non-monocytic peripheral blood mononuclear cells due in part to NF-κB and STAT1 pathway activation. Expression of several of these miRNAs was regulated at a preprocessing step because the expression of the primary miRNAs, but not Dicer, correlated with mature miRNA expression. We conclude that a set of miRNAs is regulated during MDM differentiation, and the rate is uniquely modified for each miRNA by environmental factors. The low basal expression of activation-associated miRNAs in monocytes and their dynamic rates of accumulation during MDM differentiation permit monocytes to tailor miRNA profiles in peripheral tissues during differentiation to macrophages.

Neither the antigenic target(s) nor the cell population(s) responsible for CNS tissue destruction in MS have been fully defined. The objective of this study was to simultaneously determine the antigen (Ag)-specificity and phenotype of un-manipulated intrathecal CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of patients with relapsing-remitting and progressive MS compared to subjects with other inflammatory neurological diseases. We applied a novel Ag-recognition assay based on co-cultures of freshly obtained cerebrospinal fluid T cells and autologous dendritic cells pre-loaded with complex candidate Ag's. We observed comparably low T cell responses to complex auto-Ag's including human myelin, brain homogenate, and cell lysates of apoptotically modified oligodendroglial and neuronal cells in all cohorts and both compartments. Conversely, we detected a strong intrathecal enrichment of Epstein-Barr virus- and human herpes virus 6-specific (but not cytomegalovirus-specific) reactivities of the Th1-phenotype throughout all patients. Qualitatively, the intrathecal enrichment of herpes virus reactivities was more pronounced in MS patients. This enrichment was completely reversed by long-term treatment with the IL-2 modulating antibody daclizumab, which strongly inhibits MS disease activity. Finally, we observed a striking discrepancy between diminished intrathecal T cell proliferation and enhanced cytokine production of herpes virus-specific T cells among progressive MS patients, consistent with the phenotype of terminally differentiated cells. The data suggest that intrathecal administration of novel therapeutic agents targeting immune cells outside of the proliferation cycle may be necessary to effectively eliminate intrathecal inflammation in progressive MS."

Multi-linear regression and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the relation of CCT and IOP, and the effect of gender, age, height, weight, refractive condition on CCT and IOP respectively.The mean CCT and IOP were 554.19±35.46 µm and 15.31±2.57 mmHg. There were significant correlations between the CCT and IOP values. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between CCT and IOP (r = 0.44, P<0.05). Linear regression equation: IOP = -2.35+0.032CCT, which means the IOP will increase 0.32 mm Hg for every 10-µm increase in CCT. The mean of Corrected IOP (CIOP) was 15.32±2.38 mmHg and had no relation with CCT. There was a negative correlation between refraction degree and CCT (P<0.05), but no correlation between refraction degree and IOP. Multi-linear regression model revealed that the height, weight, age and gender have no effect on the distribution of CCT and IOP respectively.There is a 0.32 mmHg increase in IOP for every 10-µm increase in CCT. The height, weight, age and gender has no effect on the distribution of CCT and IOP. CCT will become thinner with myopia diopters increases in juveniles. The measurement of CCT is helpful in evaluating the actual IOP correctly."
https://openalex.org/W2083169469,"The systemic response to decreasing oxygen levels is hypoxic vasodilation. While this mechanism has been known for more than a century, the underlying cellular events have remained incompletely understood. Nitrite signaling is critically involved in vessel relaxation under hypoxia. This can be attributed to the presence of myoglobin in the vessel wall together with other potential nitrite reductases, which generate nitric oxide, one of the most potent vasodilatory signaling molecules. Questions remain relating to the precise concentration of nitrite and the exact dose-response relations between nitrite and myoglobin under hypoxia. It is furthermore unclear whether regulatory mechanisms exist which balance this interaction. Nitrite tissue levels were similar across all species investigated. We then investigated the exact fractional myoglobin desaturation in an ex vivo approach when gassing with 1% oxygen. Within a short time frame myoglobin desaturated to 58±12%. Given that myoglobin significantly contributes to nitrite reduction under hypoxia, dose-response experiments using physiological to pharmacological nitrite concentrations were conducted. Along all concentrations, abrogation of myoglobin in mice impaired vasodilation. As reactive oxygen species may counteract the vasodilatory response, we used superoxide dismutase and its mimic tempol as well as catalase and ebselen to reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species during hypoxic vasodilation. Incubation of tempol in conjunction with catalase alone and catalase/ebselen increased the vasodilatory response to nitrite. Our study shows that modest hypoxia leads to a significant nitrite-dependent vessel relaxation. This requires the presence of vascular myoglobin for both physiological and pharmacological nitrite levels. Reactive oxygen species, in turn, modulate this vasodilation response."
https://openalex.org/W2014538969,"Obstructive nephropathy is an aggressive form of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is characterized by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and interstitial fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of EMT and fibrosis are complex and not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the contribution of Akt2 to experimental renal EMT and fibrosis using the well-established model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). We found that Akt2 and phosphor (p)-Akt protein levels were increased in the obstructed kidneys. UUO induced activation of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling. Importantly, knockout of Akt2 suppressed UUO-induced EMT, kidney fibrosis, increased GSK3β activity, and decreased expression of Snail and β-catenin. Inhibition of GSK3β with LiCl (the inhibitor of GSK3β) increased the expression of Snail and β-catenin in cultured kidney epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that Akt2 partially contributes to interstitial fibrosis following UUO and that inhibition of this signaling pathway may provide a novel approach of prevent progression of renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2098101628,"X-ray crystallography is the primary approach to solve the three-dimensional structure of a protein. However, a major bottleneck of this method is the failure of multi-step experimental procedures to yield diffraction-quality crystals, including sequence cloning, protein material production, purification, crystallization and ultimately, structural determination. Accordingly, prediction of the propensity of a protein to successfully undergo these experimental procedures based on the protein sequence may help narrow down laborious experimental efforts and facilitate target selection. A number of bioinformatics methods based on protein sequence information have been developed for this purpose. However, our knowledge on the important determinants of propensity for a protein sequence to produce high diffraction-quality crystals remains largely incomplete. In practice, most of the existing methods display poorer performance when evaluated on larger and updated datasets. To address this problem, we constructed an up-to-date dataset as the benchmark, and subsequently developed a new approach termed ‘PredPPCrys’ using the support vector machine (SVM). Using a comprehensive set of multifaceted sequence-derived features in combination with a novel multi-step feature selection strategy, we identified and characterized the relative importance and contribution of each feature type to the prediction performance of five individual experimental steps required for successful crystallization. The resulting optimal candidate features were used as inputs to build the first-level SVM predictor (PredPPCrys I). Next, prediction outputs of PredPPCrys I were used as the input to build second-level SVM classifiers (PredPPCrys II), which led to significantly enhanced prediction performance. Benchmarking experiments indicated that our PredPPCrys method outperforms most existing procedures on both up-to-date and previous datasets. In addition, the predicted crystallization targets of currently non-crystallizable proteins were provided as compendium data, which are anticipated to facilitate target selection and design for the worldwide structural genomics consortium.

https://openalex.org/W2038436541,"Most aerobic organisms contain catalase, which functions to decompose hydrogen peroxide. Typical catalases are structurally complex homo-tetrameric enzymes with one heme prosthetic group buried in each subunit. It is not known how catalase in the cell is assembled from its constituents. The bacterium Enterococcus faecalis cannot synthesize heme but can acquire it from the environment to form a cytoplasmic catalase. We have in E. faecalis monitored production of the enzyme polypeptide (KatA) depending on the availability of heme and used our findings to devise a procedure for the purification of preparative amounts of in vivo-synthesized apocatalase. We show that fully active catalase can be obtained in vitro by incubating isolated apoprotein with hemin. We have characterized features of the assembly process and describe a temperature-trapped hemylated intermediate of the enzyme maturation process. Hemylation of apocatalase does not require auxiliary cell components, but rapid assembly of active enzyme seemingly is assisted in the cell. Our findings provide insight about catalase assembly and offer new experimental possibilities for detailed studies of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2088951229,"Sub-networks can expose complex patterns in an entire bio-molecular network by extracting interactions that depend on temporal or condition-specific contexts. When genes interact with each other during cellular processes, they may form differential co-expression patterns with other genes across different cell states. The identification of condition-specific sub-networks is of great importance in investigating how a living cell adapts to environmental changes. In this work, we propose the weighted MAXimum clique (WMAXC) method to identify a condition-specific sub-network. WMAXC first proposes scoring functions that jointly measure condition-specific changes to both individual genes and gene-gene co-expressions. It then employs a weaker formula of a general maximum clique problem and relates the maximum scored clique of a weighted graph to the optimization of a quadratic objective function under sparsity constraints. We combine a continuous genetic algorithm and a projection procedure to obtain a single optimal sub-network that maximizes the objective function (scoring function) over the standard simplex (sparsity constraints). We applied the WMAXC method to both simulated data and real data sets of ovarian and prostate cancer. Compared with previous methods, WMAXC selected a large fraction of cancer-related genes, which were enriched in cancer-related pathways. The results demonstrated that our method efficiently captured a subset of genes relevant under the investigated condition."
https://openalex.org/W2032551409,"ProSAAS is the precursor for some of the most abundant peptides found in mouse brain and other tissues, including peptides named SAAS, PEN, and LEN. Both SAAS and LEN are found in big and little forms due to differential processing. Initial processing of proSAAS is mediated by furin (and/or furin-like enzymes) and carboxypeptidase D, while the smaller forms are generated by secretory granule prohormone convertases and carboxypeptidase E. In mouse hypothalamus, PEN and big LEN colocalize with neuropeptide Y. In the present study, little LEN and SAAS were detected in mouse hypothalamus but not in cell bodies of neuropeptide Y-expressing neurons. PEN and big LEN show substantial colocalization in hypothalamus, but big LEN and little LEN do not. An antiserum to SAAS that detects both big and little forms of this peptide did not show substantial colocalization with PEN or big LEN. To further study this, the AtT-20 cells mouse pituitary corticotrophic cell line was transfected with rat proSAAS and the distribution of peptides examined. As found in mouse hypothalamus, only some of the proSAAS-derived peptides colocalized with each other in AtT-20 cells. The two sites within proSAAS that are known to be efficiently cleaved by furin were altered by site-directed mutagenesis to convert the P4 Arg into Lys; this change converts the sequences from furin consensus sites into prohormone convertase consensus sites. Upon expression of the mutated form of proSAAS in AtT-20 cells, there was significantly more colocalization of proSAAS-derived peptides PEN and SAAS. Taken together, these results indicate that proSAAS is initially cleaved in the Golgi or trans-Golgi network by furin and/or furin-like enzymes and the resulting fragments are sorted into distinct vesicles and further processed by additional enzymes into the mature peptides."

This study aims to investigate the prevalence and determinants of unmet needs for cardiovascular care based on objective assessment.Multilevel analysis is used to analyse the determinants of met needs and multilevel multiple imputation is applied to manage missing data. The 2008 Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS4) survey is the source of the household data used in this study, while district data is sourced from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance. The data shows that nearly 70% of respondents with moderate to high cardiovascular risk failed to receive cardiovascular care. Higher income, possession of health insurance and residence in urban areas are significantly associated with met needs for cardiovascular care, while health facility density and physician density show no association with them.The prevalence of unmet needs for cardiovascular care is considerable in Indonesia. Inequality persists as a factor in meeting needs for cardiovascular care as the needs of people with higher incomes and those living in urban areas are more likely to be met. Alleviation of poverty, provision of health care insurance for the poor, and improvement in the quality of healthcare providers are recommended in order to meet this ever-increasing need."
https://openalex.org/W2078154450,"Background The data of MARCH (Metformin and AcaRbose in Chinese as the initial Hypoglycaemic treatment) trial demonstrated that acarbose and metformin have similar efficacy as initial therapy for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether the therapeutic efficacy was diversified under different body mass index (BMI) status. Methods All 784 subjects were divided into normal-weight group (BMI<24 kg/m2), overweight group (BMI 24–28 kg/m2) and obese group (BMI≥28 kg/m2). Patients were assigned to 48 weeks of therapy with acarbose or metformin, respectively. The clinical trial registry number was ChiCTR-TRC-08000231. Results The reduction of HbA1c levels and the proportion of patients with HbA1c of 6.5% or less were similar in the three groups after acarbose and metformin treatment. In overweight group, fasting blood glucose (FBG) after metformin treatment showed greater decline compared to acarbose group at 48 weeks [−1.73 (−1.99 to −1.46) vs. −1.37 (−1.61 to −1.12), P<0.05), however the decrease of 2 h post-challenge blood glucose (PBG) after acarbose treatment at 48 weeks was bigger compared to metformin group [−3.34 (−3.83 to−2.84) vs. −2.35 (−2.85 to −1.85), P<0.01 ]. Both acarbose and metformin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in waist circumference, hip circumference, weight and BMI in the three groups (all P<0.05). Conclusion Acarbose and metformin decreased HbA1c levels similarly regardless of BMI status of Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Acarbose and metformin resulted in a significant and modest improvement of anthropometric parametres in different BMI status. Thus, acarbose treatment may contribute a similar effect on plasma glucose control compared to metformin, even in obesity patients. Trial Registration ChiCTR.org ChiCTR-TRC-08000231"
https://openalex.org/W2048767940,"Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a major challenge after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but treatment options for patients are still limited. In many cases first-line treatment with glucocorticoids is not successful. Among second-line therapies the extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is frequently performed, due to induction of selective tolerance instead of general immunosuppression. However, for some patients with severe acute GvHD the leukapheresis step of the ECP procedure is physically exhausting and limits the number of ECP cycles.We hypothesized that leukocytes from healthy cell donors could be used as a replacement for ECP leukocytes gained from the GvHD patient. For this purpose we used a well established mouse model of acute GvHD. The ECP therapy was based on cells with the genetic background of the initial donor of the stem cell transplantation. As a precondition we developed a protocol representing conventional ECP in mice equivalent to clinical used ECP setup.We could demonstrate that conventional, clinically derived ECP setup is able to alleviate acute GvHD. By using leukocytes obtained from healthy mice with the bone marrow donor's genetic background we could not observe a statistically significant therapeutic effect.Conventional human ECP setup is effective in the mouse model of severe acute GvHD. In addition we could not prove that ECP cells from healthy mice with bone marrow donor's genetic background are as effective as ECP cells derived from GvHD mice. Based on our findings, new questions arise for further studies, in which the cellular characteristics for ECP mediated immune tolerance are a matter of investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2062257990,"The blockade of angiotensin II (Ang II) is a major therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy. The main roles of Ang II in renal disease are mediated via the Ang type 1 receptor (AT1R). Upregulation of clusterin/apolipoprotein J has been reported in nephropathy models, suggesting it has a protective role in nephropathogenesis. Here, we studied how clusterin acts against Ang II-induced renal fibrosis. Levels of AT1R and fibrotic markers in clusterin-/- mice and Ang II infused rats transfected with an adenovirus encoding clusterin were evaluated by immunoblot analysis, real time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical staining. The effect of clusterin on renal fibrosis was evaluated in NRK-52E cells, a cultured renal tubular epithelial cell line, using immunoblot analysis and real time RT-PCR. Nuclear localization of NF-κB was evaluated using immunofluorecence and co-immunoprecipitation. Renal fibrosis and expression of AT1R was higher in the kidneys of clusterin-/- mice than in those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, loss of clusterin accelerated Ang II-stimulated renal fibrosis and AT1R expression. Overexpression of clusterin in proximal tubular epithelial cells decreased the levels of Ang II-stimulated fibrotic markers and AT1R. Moreover, intrarenal delivery of clusterin attenuated Ang II-mediated expression of fibrotic markers and AT1R in rats. Fluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation in conjunction with western blot revealed that clusterin inhibited Ang II-stimulated nuclear localization of p-NF-κB via a direct physical interaction and subsequently decreased the AT1R level in proximal tubular epithelial cells. These data suggest that clusterin attenuates Ang II-induced renal fibrosis by inhibition of NF-κB activation and subsequent downregulation of AT1R. This study raises the possibility that clusterin could be used as a therapeutic target for Ang II-induced renal diseases."

This study was conducted to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of CD209 and the risk KD. Methods A total of 948 subjects (381 KD and 567 controls) were recruited. Nine tagging SNPs (rs8112310, rs4804800, rs11465421, rs1544766, rs4804801, rs2287886, rs735239, rs735240, rs4804804) were selected for TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Clinical phenotypes, coronary artery lesions (CAL) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment outcomes were collected for analysis. Results Significant associations were found between CD209 polymorphisms (rs4804800, rs2287886, rs735240) and the risk of KD. Haplotype analysis for CD209 polymorphisms showed that A/A/G haplotype (P = 0.0002, OR = 1.61) and G/A/G haplotype (P = 0.0365, OR = 1.52) had higher risk of KD as compared with G/G/A haplotype in rs2287886/rs735239/rs735240 pairwise allele analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2087069765,"Objective The role of planning in binge eating episodes is unknown. We investigated the characteristics of planning associated with food cues in binging patients. We studied planning based on backward reasoning, reasoning that determines a sequence of actions back to front from the final outcome. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted with 20 healthy participants, 20 bulimia nervosa (BN), 22 restrictive (ANR) and 23 binging anorexia nervosa (ANB), without any concomitant impulsive disorder. In neutral/relaxing, binge food and stressful conditions, backward reasoning was assessed with the Race game, promotion of delayed large rewards with an intertemporal discounting task, attention with the Simon task, and repeating a dominant behavior with the Go/No-go task. Results BN and to a lower extent ANB patients succeeded more at the Race game in food than in neutral condition. This difference discriminated binging from non-binging participants. Backward reasoning in the food condition was associated with lower approach behavior toward food in BN patients, and higher food avoidance in ANB patients. Enhanced backward reasoning in the food condition related to preferences for delayed large rewards in BN patients. In BN and ANB patients the enhanced success rate at the Race game in the food condition was associated with higher attention paid to binge food. Conclusion These findings introduce a novel process underlying binges: planning based on backward reasoning is associated with binges. It likely aims to reduce craving for binge foods and extend binge refractory period in BN patients, and avoid binging in ANB patients. Shifts between these goals might explain shifts between eating disorder subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W2112760590,"We are developing a laboratory-scale model to improve our understanding and capacity to assess the biological risks of genetically engineered bacteria and their genetic elements in the natural environment. Our hypothetical scenario concerns an industrial bioreactor failure resulting in the introduction of genetically engineered bacteria to a downstream municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP). As the first step towards developing a model for this scenario, we sampled microbial communities from the aeration basin of a MWWTP at three seasonal time points. Having established a baseline for community composition, we investigated how the community changed when propagated in the laboratory, including cell culture media conditions that could provide selective pressure in future studies. Specifically, using PhyloChip 16S-rRNA-gene targeting microarrays, we compared the compositions of sampled communities to those of inocula propagated in the laboratory in simulated wastewater conditionally amended with various carbon sources (glucose, chloroacetate, D-threonine) or the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C2mim]Cl). Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were predominant in both aeration basin and laboratory-cultured communities. Laboratory-cultured communities were enriched in γ-Proteobacteria. Enterobacteriaceae, and Aeromonadaceae were enriched by glucose, Pseudomonadaceae by chloroacetate and D-threonine, and Burkholderiacea by high (50 mM) concentrations of chloroacetate. Microbial communities cultured with chloroacetate and D-threonine were more similar to sampled field communities than those cultured with glucose or [C2mim]Cl. Although observed relative richness in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was lower for laboratory cultures than for field communities, both flask and reactor systems supported phylogenetically diverse communities.

A key regulator of 5-HT levels is the transmembrane serotonin transporter (5-HTT; SLC6A4) that governs the reuptake of 5-HT. Recent studies have indicated 5-HTT expression may be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. We investigated DNA methylation status of SLC6A4 gene in the gastric mucosa from functional dyspepsia (FD) because of their potential role in dyspeptic symptoms.Endoscopic gastric biopsies were obtained from 78 subjects with no upper abdominal symptoms and 79 patients with FD. Bisulfite Pyrosequencing was carried out to determine the methylation status of promoter CpG islands (PCGIs), promoter non-CpG islands (PNCGIs) and gene body non-CpG islands (NPNCGIs) in the SLC6A4 gene. Gene expression was examined by real-time PCR.In overall, methylation level of PCGIs was significantly lower in FD compared to control subjects (p = 0.04). On the other hand, methylation level of NPNCGIs was significantly higher in FD compared to control subjects (p = 0.03). Lower methylation level in PNCGIs was highlighted in the patients with PDS (p = 0.01), while higher methylation level in NPNCGIs was more prominent in the patients with EPS (p = 0.017). Methylation levels of PCGIs and PNCGIs were inversely correlated, while methylation levels of NPNCGIs was positively correlated with SLC6A4 mRNA levels in FD patients.Our data suggest that change in DNA methylation pattern of SLC6A4 in the gastric mucosa may have a role for developing FD.

However, this test is not widely available and, due to its invasive nature, is potentially less suitable for valuable animals in training or in the human paediatric setting. Furthermore, increasingly, RYR1 gene polymorphisms (of unknown pathogenicity and significance) are being identified through next generation sequencing projects. Consequently, we have investigated a less invasive test that can be used to study calcium homeostasis in cultured, skin-derived fibroblasts that are converted to the muscle lineage by viral transduction with a MyoD (myogenic differentiation 1) transgene. Similar models have been utilised to examine calcium homeostasis in human patient cells, however, to date, there has been no detailed assessment of the cells' calcium homeostasis, and in particular, the responses to agonists and antagonists of RYR1. Here we describe experiments conducted to assess calcium handling of the cells and examine responses to treatment with dantrolene, a drug commonly used for prophylaxis of recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis in horses and malignant hyperthermia in humans."

The discrimination of distinct lineages and the reconstruction of their phylogenetic history are key information to infer their biomedical properties. However, the phylogenetic picture is often clouded by occasional events of recombination across divergent lineages, limiting the relevance of classical phylogenetic analysis and dichotomic trees. We have applied a network analysis based on graph theory to illustrate the relationships among genotypes of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasitic protozoan responsible for Chagas disease, to identify major lineages and to unravel their past history of divergence and possible recombination events. At the scale of T. cruzi subspecific diversity, graph theory-based networks applied to 22 isoenzyme loci (262 distinct Multi-Locus-Enzyme-Electrophoresis -MLEE) and 19 microsatellite loci (66 Multi-Locus-Genotypes -MLG) fully confirms the high clustering of genotypes into major lineages or ""near-clades"". The release of the dichotomic constraint associated with phylogenetic reconstruction usually applied to Multilocus data allows identifying putative hybrids and their parental lineages. Reticulate topology suggests a slightly different history for some of the main ""near-clades"", and a possibly more complex origin for the putative hybrids than hitherto proposed. Finally the sub-network of the near-clade T. cruzi I (28 MLG) shows a clustering subdivision into three differentiated lesser near-clades (""Russian doll pattern""), which confirms the hypothesis recently proposed by other investigators. The present study broadens and clarifies the hypotheses previously obtained from classical markers on the same sets of data, which demonstrates the added value of this approach. This underlines the potential of graph theory-based network analysis for describing the nature and relationships of major pathogens, thereby opening stimulating prospects to unravel the organization, dynamics and history of major micropathogen lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2004832059,"Finding the rules underlying how axons of cortical neurons form neural circuits and modify their corresponding synaptic strength is the still subject of intense research. Experiments have shown that internal calcium concentration, and both the precise timing and temporal order of pre and postsynaptic action potentials, are important constituents governing whether the strength of a synapse located on the dendrite is increased or decreased. In particular, previous investigations focusing on spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have typically observed an asymmetric temporal window governing changes in synaptic efficacy. Such a temporal window emphasizes that if a presynaptic spike, arriving at the synaptic terminal, precedes the generation of a postsynaptic action potential, then the synapse is potentiated; however if the temporal order is reversed, then depression occurs. Furthermore, recent experimental studies have now demonstrated that the temporal window also depends on the dendritic location of the synapse. Specifically, it was shown that in distal regions of the apical dendrite, the magnitude of potentiation was smaller and the window for depression was broader, when compared to observations from the proximal region of the dendrite. To date, the underlying mechanism(s) for such a distance-dependent effect is (are) currently unknown. Here, using the ionic cable theory framework in conjunction with the standard calcium based plasticity model, we show for the first time that such distance-dependent inhomogeneities in the temporal learning window for STDP can be largely explained by both the spatial and active properties of the dendrite."
