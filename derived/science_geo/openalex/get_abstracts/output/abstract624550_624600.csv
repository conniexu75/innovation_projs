Yet for those patients that do not respond, simultaneous strategies that mobilize the immune system and directly target malignant cells may be more effective. Ruscetti et al. report that combining two clinically approved cancer drugs promoted immune surveillance and killing of KRAS-mutant lung tumors in mice (see the Perspective by Cornen and Vivier). The two small molecules—a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor and a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor—induced natural killer (NK) cell recruitment and elimination of senescent lung cancer cells, which did not occur when either agent was used alone.

We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or ""free"" forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-, and immunogen glycan-dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via immunogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses. These findings identify an innate immune-mediated recognition pathway promoting antibody responses to particulate antigens, with broad implications for humoral immunity and vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2876761712,"Cascading effects of regime shifts The potential for regime shifts and critical transitions in ecological and Earth systems, particularly in a changing climate, has received considerable attention. However, the possibility of interactions between such shifts is poorly understood. Rocha et al. used network analysis to explore whether critical transitions in ecosystems can be coupled with each other, even when far apart (see the Perspective by Scheffer and van Nes). They report different types of potential cascading effects, including domino effects and hidden feedbacks, that can be prevalent in different systems. Such cascading effects can couple the dynamics of regime shifts in distant places, which suggests that the interactions between transitions should be borne in mind in future forecasts.

Orosa-Puente et al. show why a new lateral root emerges on the damp side of a root rather than the dry side (see the Perspective by Giehl and von Wirén). The transcription factor ARF7 is found across the whole root but acquires a posttranslational modification on the dry side of the root, which represses its function. ARF7 on the damp side remains functional and is thus able to initiate the signaling cascade that leads to a new lateral root. Science , this issue p. 1407 ; see also p. 1358"

Balancing the ratio of these inputs is accomplished by a short circuit in electron flow through photosynthetic complex I, a proton pump that contributes to ATP production but does not increase net reducing equivalents in the cell. Schuller et al. solved a cryo–electron microscopy structure of photosynthetic complex I (see the Perspective by Brandt) and went on to reconstitute electron transfer using the electron carrier protein ferredoxin.

For instance, two mutations have previously been found to produce a dominant negative for TRESK, a two-pore-domain K+ channel implicated in migraine: TRESK-MT, a 2-bp frameshift mutation, and TRESK-C110R. Both mutants inhibit TRESK, but only TRESK-MT increases sensory neuron excitability and is linked to migraine. Here, we identify a new mechanism, termed frameshift mutation-induced alternative translation initiation (fsATI), that may explain why only TRESK-MT is associated with migraine. fsATI leads to the production of a second protein fragment, TRESK-MT2, which co-assembles with and inhibits TREK1 and TREK2, two other two-pore-domain K+ channels, to increase trigeminal sensory neuron excitability, leading to a migraine-like phenotype in rodents.

Migraine is a common, disabling neurological disorder with a genetic, environmental, and hormonal component with an annual prevalence estimated at ∼15%. It is characterized by attacks of severe, usually unilateral, and throbbing headache and can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. Migraine is clinically divided into two main subtypes: migraine with aura (MA), when a migraine is preceded by transient neurological disturbances that are usually visual, and migraine without aura (MO). Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the aura, although its precise relationship to headache is unclear. Activation and sensitization of trigeminal neurons (TG) leading to the release of pro-inflammatory peptides is likely a key component in pain initiation and transmission in migraine (Noseda and Burstein, 2013Noseda R.

Recent evidence points to a pivotal contribution of a variety of two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels in chronic pain processing. The diverse K2P channel family is made of 15 subtypes, which form 6 subfamilies. The activity of these channels drives the membrane potential toward the K+ equilibrium potential and therefore reduces cellular excitability. Expression of several K2P channel subunits has been detected in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion and trigeminal neurons (Alloui et al., 2006Alloui A. Zimmermann K. Mamet J. Duprat F. Noël J.

One subtype of K2P channels that is highly expressed in sensory neurons, TRESK, has been directly linked to MA via a causally linked 2-bp frameshift mutation (F139WfsX24) identified in the KCNK18 gene, which causes premature truncation of TRESK (“TRESK-MT”; Lafrenière et al., 2010Lafrenière R.G.

Neurol. 2010; 6: 643Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This mutation segregated perfectly with the MA phenotype in a large pedigree and was shown to produce a non-functional protein that can serve as a dominant negative that functionally downregulates the wild-type (WT) TRESK channel (Lafrenière et al., 2010Lafrenière R.G. Cader M.Z. Poulin J.F. Andres-Enguix I. Simoneau M. Gupta N. Boisvert K. Lafrenière F. McLaughlan S.

Neurol. 2010; 6: 643Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). TRESK-MT has been shown to induce hyperexcitability of TG neurons (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z. Liu P. Ren F. Cao Y.Q. Nonmigraine-associated TRESK K+ channel variant C110R does not increase the excitability of trigeminal ganglion neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 112: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2013Liu P. Xiao Z. Ren F. Guo Z. Chen Z. Zhao H. Cao Y.Q. Functional analysis of a migraine-associated TRESK K+ channel mutation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 12810-12824Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which likely underscores its role in migraine. However, in subsequent genetic screening studies, another missense TRESK variant, C110R, was identified (Andres-Enguix et al., 2012Andres-Enguix I. Shang L. Stansfeld P.J. Morahan J.M. Sansom M.S. Lafrenière R.G. Roy B. Griffiths L.R. Rouleau G.A. Ebers G.C. et al.Functional analysis of missense variants in the TRESK (KCNK18) K channel.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2: 237Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TRESK-C110R, similar to TRESK-MT, exerts a dominant-negative effect on WT-TRESK in heterologous cells, but expression of this mutant was found to have no effect on TG excitability (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z. Liu P. Ren F. Cao Y.Q. Nonmigraine-associated TRESK K+ channel variant C110R does not increase the excitability of trigeminal ganglion neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 112: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This absence of effect explains why this mutant was found in both migraine patients and control subjects (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z. Liu P. Ren F. Cao Y.Q. Nonmigraine-associated TRESK K+ channel variant C110R does not increase the excitability of trigeminal ganglion neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 112: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, despite the fact that both mutations lead to the same apparent effect on TRESK function, only TRESK-MT is able to increase TG excitability and is linked to migraine pathophysiology. Classically a eukaryotic mRNA is thought to contain one translation start codon, which allows the production of a single protein species. However, in some cases, eukaryotic ribosomes can recognize several alternative translation start sites to induce the formation of several different proteins from the same mRNA (Kochetov, 2008Kochetov A.V. Alternative translation start sites and hidden coding potential of eukaryotic mRNAs.BioEssays. 2008; 30: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This alternative translation initiation is a means of expanding the proteome (Kochetov, 2008Kochetov A.V. Alternative translation start sites and hidden coding potential of eukaryotic mRNAs.BioEssays. 2008; 30: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and has been shown to increase the functional diversity of K2P channels (Thomas et al., 2008Thomas D. Plant L.D. Wilkens C.M. McCrossan Z.A. Goldstein S.A. Alternative translation initiation in rat brain yields K2P2.1 potassium channels permeable to sodium.Neuron. 2008; 58: 859-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that it plays a role in TRESK-mediated migraine pathophysiology. In this study, we addressed why TRESK-MT (F139WfsX24), but not TRESK-C110R, is able to increase TG excitability and, potentially, play a role in migraines. Using single-molecule fluorescence and chemical optogenetic methods, we found that TRESK is able to heterodimerize with 2 distantly related K2P channels from another subfamily, TREK1 and TREK2, and that TRESK-MT strongly inhibits TRESK, TREK1, and TREK2 currents. In stark contrast, we show that TRESK-C110R is only able to inhibit TRESK, but not TREK1 or TREK2. Furthermore, we show, using double knockout (KO) mice for TREK1 and TREK2, that TRESK-MT increases TG neuronal excitability by inhibiting TREK1 and TREK2. Consistent with a role for TREK1 and TREK2 in migraine induction, we found that double-KO mice for TREK1 and TREK2 present, at rest, a migraine-like allodynia phenotype. These results resolve the contradictory lack of effect of TRESK-C110R, which targets only TRESK and not TREK1 or TREK2. Strikingly, we next find that the 2-bp frameshift mutation of TRESK-MT puts an alternative start codon in frame, which leads to the translation of a second TRESK fragment, termed MT2, which specifically co-assembles with TREK1 and TREK2 to downregulate their function, leading to the TG excitability increase. Consistent with a role for MT2 in migraine induction, we found that MT2 expression within the trigeminal ganglia induced a migraine-like allodynia phenotype in rat. Finally, we find that other previously uncharacterized migraine-associated TRESK mutations also produce multiple fragments via alternative translation initiation (ATI) that can have distinct effects on TRESK and TREK channels. Together, these findings identify frameshift-induced ATI (fsATI) as a mechanism initiated by TRESK mutations, which leads to two protein fragments with dominant-negative effects on distinct channel targets to, ultimately, increase sensory neuron excitability, which may contribute to migraine induction. Despite the fact that K2P channels share a similar architecture and global function, they share a low level of sequence identity, even between members of the same subfamily. Surprisingly, this low level of identity does not preclude heteromerization, as we and others recently showed within the TREK subfamily (Blin et al., 2016Blin S. Ben Soussia I. Kim E.J. Brau F. Kang D. Lesage F. Bichet D. Mixing and matching TREK/TRAAK subunits generate heterodimeric K2P channels with unique properties.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2016; 113: 4194-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on this and the fact that TG neurons express many K2P channels (TREK1, TREK2, TRAAK, TASK1, and TASK3; Bautista et al., 2008Bautista D.M. Sigal Y.M. Milstein A.D. Garrison J.L. Zorn J.A.

Lett. 2009; 454: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the difference between TRESK mutants is due to their differential ability to modify the function of other K2P channels through heteromerization. To assess the ability of TRESK to heteromerize with other K2P channels that are expressed in TG neurons, we used the single-molecule pull-down (“SiMPull”) assay (Jain et al., 2012Jain A. Liu R. Xiang Y.K. Ha T. Single-molecule pull-down for studying protein interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to visualize individual antibody-immobilized protein complexes on polyethylene-glycol-passivated glass coverslips (Figure 1A). We co-expressed GFP-TRESK with either hemagglutinin HA-TRESK, HA-TREK1, HA-TREK2, HA-TRAAK, HA-TASK1, or HA-TASK3 and assessed their ability to co-immunoprecipitate (coIP) GFP-TRESK via an anti-HA antibody. HA-TRESK, HA-TREK1, and HA-TREK2, were able to coIP many fluorescent GFP-TRESK spots (Figures 1B and 1C), whereas no GFP-TRESK spots were observed for HA-TRAAK, HA-TASK1, or HA-TASK3 (Figure 1C), indicating that TRESK co-assembly with other K2P channels is specific for TREK1 and TREK2. Importantly, controls showed that identical results were observed in two different non-ionic detergents (Figure 1C), that similar expression levels were seen for GFP-TRESK when co-expressed with HA-TREK1 or HA-TRESK (Figure S1A), that all HA-tagged K2P constructs were able to pull down themselves (Figures S1B and S1C), and that pull-down was dependent on the presence of the anti-HA antibody (Figure S1D) and confirm that TREK1, TREK2, and TRESK can be co-expressed in the same cultured TG neurons using immunofluochemistry and single-cell RT-PCR (Figure S1F). We next used photobleaching step analysis (Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) to determine the stoichiometry of TREK1 and TRESK complexes to test the hypothesis that they form heterodimers. First, we confirmed that HA-GFP-TREK1 form homodimers in our assay by observing ∼70% 2-step bleaching for each when expressed and immunoprecipitated alone with anti-HA antibodies (Figure S2A), consistent with the formation of strict dimers with a GFP maturation rate of ∼80%. Then, we counted the number of GFP-TRESK subunits within a HA-TREK1/GFP-TRESK complex by observing bleaching steps of GFP-TRESK coIP with immobilized HA-TREK1 (Figure S2C). The majority of fluorescence intensity trajectories showed one bleaching step (∼70%; Figure S2C). This distribution is similar to the one observed for HA-TREK1/GFP-TREK1 complexes (Figure S2B) and agrees well with a 1:1 stoichiometry showing that TREK1-TRESK is primarily a heterodimer. To test the functionality of the TREK1-TRESK heterodimer, we developed a heterodimerization assay based on an engineered “photoswitchable conditional subunit” (TREK1-PCS) of TREK1. The TREK1-PCS is a TREK1 subunit where the C terminus has been deleted to produce endoplasmic reticulum retention, which can be rescued through co-assembly with a full-length subunit (Sandoz et al., 2012Sandoz G. Levitz J. Kramer R.H. Isacoff E.Y. Optical control of endogenous proteins with a photoswitchable conditional subunit reveals a role for TREK1 in GABA(B) signaling.Neuron. 2012; 74: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Following co-assembly and surface targeting, TREK1-PCS can then optically control the channel via a tethered photoswitchable blocker (“MAQ”), which attaches to a genetically engineered cysteine. Therefore, gain of photosensitivity of an identified co-expressed TREK-interacting subunit allows for the verification of a functional heteromer with TREK1. As expected, expression of TREK1-PCS alone did not generate a photoswitchable current (Figure 1D), but co-expression with either TREK1 or TRESK induced a robust photoswitchable current (Figures 1E and 1F), indicating that the TRESK subunit is able to co-assemble with TREK1-PCS. Consistent with SiMPull data, no photocurrent was observed when TASK1 (Figure 1G) or TASK3 (Figure S1E) were co-expressed with TREK1-PCS. Furthermore, the bleaching step distribution of GFP-TREK1-PCS spots coIPed with immobilized HA-TREK1 is similar to HA-TREK1/GFP-TREK1; the majority of fluorescence spots showed one bleaching step (∼70%; Figure S2D), supporting the conclusion that the light-gated TREK1-PCS/TRESK current is carried by a TREK1-PCS/TRESK heterodimer with a common pore. Next, to test the functional properties of the TREK1-TRESK heteromer, we constructed a linked, tandem dimer to have a uniform representation at the surface of the cell of the TREK1-TRESK heteromer (Figure S3). This heteromeric channel displayed properties that are a mix of those from TREK1 and TRESK homodimers. Notably, TRESK is insensitive to arachidonic acid and TREK1 is sensitive (Figures S3A–S3C) and TRESK-TREK1 tandems show an intermediate sensitivity to arachidonic acid (Figure S3C). Furthermore, similar to TRESK, but not TREK1, TRESK-TREK1 tandems showed sensitivity to intracellular calcium, as tested with ionomycin application (Figures S3D and S3F). Consistent with this, the light-gated TREK1-PCS/TRESK current is also calcium sensitive (Figures S3E and S3F), confirming that the light-gated TREK1-PCS/TRESK current is carried by a TRESK1-TRESK heteromer with a common pore. Having found that TREK can physically and functionally heteromerize with TRESK and that all three channel subtypes are co-expressed in sensory neurons, we next investigated the ability of TRESK mutants to modify TREK1 and TREK2 currents. As previously shown (Andres-Enguix et al., 2012Andres-Enguix I. Shang L. Stansfeld P.J. Morahan J.M. Sansom M.S. Lafrenière R.G. Roy B. Griffiths L.R. Rouleau G.A. Ebers G.C. et al.Functional analysis of missense variants in the TRESK (KCNK18) K channel.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2: 237Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), both TRESK-MT and TRESK-C110R exert a dominant-negative effect on whole-cell TRESK currents (Figures 2A–2C). Because TREK1 can co-assemble with TRESK (Figure 1), we addressed the impact of the MT and C110R variants on TREK1 current. We found that TRESK-C110R co-expression did not modify TREK1 current, whereas TRESK-MT co-expression induced a near-complete inhibition of TREK1 current (Figures 2D–2F). Similar to TREK1, TRESK-MT, but not TRESK-C110R, strongly inhibited TREK2 current (Figures 2G–2I). This dominant-negative effect is specific and likely dependent on co-assembly because TASK1, TASK3, and TRAAK, which do not coIP with TRESK (Figure 1), were not sensitive to TRESK-MT co-expression (Figure S4). To address why TRESK-C110R does not modify TREK1 or TREK2 current, we used the SiMPull assay to test the ability of TRESK-C110R to physically interact with TREK1. We co-expressed HA-TREK1 with either GFP-TRESK or GFP-TRESK-C110R and tested their ability to be coIPeded with HA-TREK1 via an anti-HA antibody. Whereas GFP-TRESK was able to be coIPed with HA-TREK1, leading to many fluorescent spots, very few spots were observed for GFP-TRESK-C110R (Figure S5A). This indicates that TREK1 can co-assemble with TRESK and that the C110R mutation leads to a drastic reduction of this association, explaining why TRESK-C110R has no effect on TREK1 current. Together, these data show that TRESK-MT can inhibit TRESK, TREK1, and TREK2, whereas TRESK-C110R is only able to inhibit TRESK. Based on the fact that TRESK-MT, but not TRESK-C110R, is able to induce TG neuron hyperexcitability (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z. Liu P. Ren F. Cao Y.Q. Nonmigraine-associated TRESK K+ channel variant C110R does not increase the excitability of trigeminal ganglion neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 112: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2013Liu P. Xiao Z. Ren F. Guo Z. Chen Z. Zhao H. Cao Y.Q. Functional analysis of a migraine-associated TRESK K+ channel mutation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 12810-12824Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TRESK-MT induces sensory neuron hyperexcitability primarily by acting on TREK1 and TREK2, not TRESK. To investigate the role of TREK1 and TREK2 in the induction of TG hyperexcitability by TRESK-MT, we tested whether overexpression of GFP-TRESK-MT alters the passive and active electrophysiological properties of small-diameter (<25 μm) TG neurons from wild-type or TREK1/TREK2 double-knockout (TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− ) mice. As previously shown, TRESK-MT expression in WT TG neurons led to a decrease of the lamotrigine current (Figure S6), leading to an increase in excitability (Figure 3C), which included a decrease in the rheobase (74 ± 11 pA versus 47 ± 5 pA; p < 0.05 for TG neurons expressing GFP or TRESK-MT, respectively) and an increase in the number of action potentials (APs) evoked by suprathreshold current injections compared to control (Figures 3A and 3C). As shown in Figure 3B, neurons from TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice were more excitable than WT TG neurons. These neurons have a smaller lamotrigine current (Figure S6), smaller rheobase (55 ± 6 pA; p < 0.05) and a significant increase in the number of APs evoked by suprathreshold current injections compared to WT TG neurons. Consistent with a role for TREK1 and 2 in mediating the effects of TRESK-MT, TRESK-MT overexpression did not alter the excitability of TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice (Figure 3D). TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− TG neurons showed no increase in the number of evoked APs or a reduction in rheobase (55 ± 6 pA versus 53 ± 5 pA for TG neuron expressing GFP or TRESK-MT, respectively; p > 0.5). Together, these data strongly support a major role for TREK1 and TREK2 in the control of TG neuron excitability and support the idea that TRESK-MT differs functionally from TRESK-C110R in its ability to target TREK1 and TREK2 to increase the excitability of TG neurons, which is likely a crucial step in the induction of migraines. Having found that expression of the TRESK-MT mutant increases TG excitability through TREK1-TREK2 inhibition, we hypothesized that TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice would show an increased susceptibility to a migraine-related phenotype. Migraine is associated with an increase of the sensitivity to all sensory modalities, and cutaneous allodynia can be used as a quantifiable marker of migraine disorder (Bates et al., 2010Bates E.A.

One approach to model acute and chronic migraine is the quantification of this increase in response to known migraine triggers, such as nitric oxide (NO) donors (Bates et al., 2010Bates E.A. Nikai T.

In a first experiment, paw mechanical nociception thresholds were determined with a dynamic von Frey aesthesiometer before and during a 3-hr period after intraperitoneal injection of ISDN (10 mg/kg; Figure 3E; Bates et al., 2010Bates E.A.

In a second experiment, we assessed mechanical nociception thresholds in both TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− and wild-type controls by intraperitoneally injecting ISDN every day for four days as a model of chronic migraine-associated pain (Figure 3E). We found that, at rest, TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice showed a decreased mechanical threshold compared to WT mice (2.6 ± 0.1 g versus 3.9 ± 0.1 g; p < 0.001). Notably, the basal mechanical threshold of TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice is similar to the allodynic threshold observed 1.5 hr after acute ISDN injection in WT mice (Figure 3F; p = 0.831). In the acute model experiment, the injection of ISDN in TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice does not induce any modification of the mechanical threshold, which remained significantly lower than in wild-type controls during the first 1.5 hr following ISDN injection (Figure 3F; p < 0.001 after 30 min and p < 0.01 after 1 hr with a linear mixed-effects model). In the chronic migraine-associated pain assay, the mechanical thresholds remained significantly lower for TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice compared to wild-type controls, but the difference was strongly reduced (Δmechanical threshold induced by 4 days ISDN treatment 0.33 ± 0.2 g in TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− versus 1.12 ± 0.1 g in WT mice; Figure 3G). Having found that TREK1−/−/TREK2−/− mice show basal mechanical allodynia that cannot be further increased by an ISDN injection, we wondered whether a treatment used in prophylaxis in migraine patient, topiramate, could reverse this observed migraine-like phenotype as was observed in models of nitroglycerin (NO) donor-induced migraine (Pradhan et al., 2014Pradhan A.A.

Blomenkemper et al. report the discovery of seed-plant fossils from Late Permian (252-million- to 260-million-year-old) deposits on the margins of the Dead Sea in Jordan. This area represents an equatorial habitat with pronounced dry seasons. These fossils, which include the earliest records of conifers, push back the ages of several important seed-plant lineages. Some of these lineages appear to span the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian, which suggests that the communities they supported may have been more stable than expected over this transition. Thus, early evolutionary innovations can occur in drought-prone tropical habitats—which rarely offer the conditions needed for fossil preservation. Science , this issue p. 1414"
https://openalex.org/W2906013873,"Milpas are rain-fed agroecosystems involving domesticated, semi-domesticated and tolerated plant species that combine maize with a large variety of other crop, tree or shrub species. Milpas are low input and low-tillage, yet highly productive agroecosystems, which have been maintained over millennia in indigenous communities in Mexico and other countries in Central America. Thus, milpas may retain ancient plant-microorganisms interactions, which could have been lost in modern high-tillage monocultures with large agrochemical input. In this work, we performed high-throughput 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing of soil adjacent to maize roots and bulk soil sampled at 30 cm from the base of the plants. We found that the bacterial communities of maize root soil had a lower alpha diversity, suggesting selection of microorganisms by maize-roots from the bulk-soil community. Beta diversity analysis confirmed that these environments harbor two distinct microbial communities; differences were driven by members of phyla Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria, as well as the order Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria), all of which had higher relative abundance in soil adjacent to the roots. Numerous studies have shown the influence of maize plants on bacterial communities found in soil attached tightly to the roots; here we further show that the influence of maize roots at milpas on bacterial communities is detectable even in plant-free soil collected nearby. We propose that members of Verrucomicrobia and other phyla found in the rhizosphere may establish beneficial plant-microbe interactions with maize roots in milpas, and propose to address their cultivation for future studies on ecology and potential use."
https://openalex.org/W2903808794,"Microfluidic devices have been successfully used to recreate in vitro biological microenvironments, including disease states. However, one constant issue for replicating microenvironments is that atmospheric oxygen concentration (21% O2) does not mimic physiological values (often around 5% O2). We have created a microfluidic device that can control both the spatial and temporal variations in oxygen tensions that are characteristic of in vivo biology. Additionally, since the microcirculation is responsive to hypoxia, we used a 3D sprouting angiogenesis assay to confirm the biological relevance of the microfluidic platform. Our device consists of three parallel connected tissue chambers and an oxygen scavenger channel placed adjacent to these tissue chambers. Experimentally measured oxygen maps were constructed using phosphorescent lifetime imaging microscopy and compared with values from a computational model. The central chamber was loaded with endothelial and fibroblast cells to form a 3D vascular network. Four to six days later, fibroblasts were loaded into the side chambers, and a day later the oxygen scavenger (sodium sulfite) was flowed through the adjacent channel to induce a spatial and temporal oxygen gradient. Our results demonstrate that both constant chronic and intermittent hypoxia can bias vessel growth, with constant chronic hypoxia showing higher degrees of biased angiogenesis. Our simple design provides consistent control of spatial and temporal oxygen gradients in the tissue microenvironment and can be used to investigate important oxygen-dependent biological processes in conditions such as cancer and ischemic heart disease."

https://openalex.org/W2905740763,"Lung ischemia and reperfusion injury (LIRI) were mediated by several processes including over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory activation. ROS generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucletide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox) may play a pivotal role in pathophysiological changes in a range of disease. However, it was poorly understood in LIRI. Thus, the purpose of our study was to explore whether GKT137831, as a special dual inhibitor of Nox1 and 4, could alleviate LIRI in mice model and explore the minimal dose. According to the protocol, this study was divided into two parts. The first part was to determine the minimal dose of Nox1/4 inhibitor in attenuating LIRI via histopathology and apoptosis analysis. Eighteen C57BL/6J male wild-type mice were randomly divided in to sham, 2.5Nox+sham, 5.0Nox+sham, IR, 2.5Nox+IR and 5.0Nox+IR groups. According to the different group, mice were pretreated with corresponding dose of Nox1/4 inhibitors or normal saline. After LIRI, the results showed 5.0mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor could be considered as the minimal dose to alleviate injury by decreasing of lung injury score and the number of TUNEL-positive cells. The second part was to further verify the benefit of 5.0mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor in lung protective effects. Thirty-seven C57BL/6J male wild-type mice were divided in to sham, IR and 5.0Nox+IR groups randomly. The results showed that expressions of inflammatory, autophagy cytokines were markedly elevated and PH value was declined after LIRI. However, 5.0 mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor significantly attenuated cytokine production as reflected by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and Q-PCR analysis. In conclusion, our findings suggested that 5.0mg/kg Nox1/4 inhibitor contributed to protect lung tissue damage after LIRI via the suppression of inflammatory and autophagy activation."
https://openalex.org/W2905635517,"Background In Western countries, most patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have concurrent ulcerative colitis (UC). The number of patients with UC in East Asia has increased markedly over the past two decades. However, current clinical features of PSC and of PSC associated with UC (PSC-UC) have not yet been clarified in East Asia, particularly in Japan. We aimed to reveal the clinical courses and associations with UC in Japanese patients with PSC from the mutual viewpoint of PSC and UC. Methods We retrospectively retrieved medical records of patients with PSC (69) and UC (1242) who were diagnosed at Chiba University Hospital between June 1991 and August 2017. Results In the present cohort, 37 patients had PSC-UC; the cumulative risks of PSC in patients with UC and of UC in patients with PSC were 3.0% and 53.6%, respectively. We confirmed similar distinctive results by a Japanese nationwide survey, noting that younger patients with PSC had a notably high possibility of association with UC. From the viewpoint of the UC cohort, the occurrence of right-sided disease was significantly higher in patients with PSC-UC than in those with UC (16.2% vs. 4.2%, P = 0.003). Pancolitis was more commonly observed in PSC-UC, and proctits/left-sided colitis was less commonly found in patients with UC. The number of patients with young-onset PSC-UC may be increasing similar to an increase in patients with UC in Japan. Conclusions In our cohort, the comorbidity rate of PSC-UC was higher than that obtained in previous reports. The incidence of PSC-UC and UC may increase in the future in East Asia, particularly in Japan."

The range of soil properties has an important influence on the expression of PAE toxicity, and the mechanisms by which soil physical and chemical properties affect the expression of toxicity of target PAEs to plants and microorganisms requires further investigation. Important soil factors affecting the eco-toxicological effects of two typical PAEs, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in a spiked soil were investigated in the present study. Soil at various pH values was spiked with three PAE concentrations (1, 5 and 20 mg DnBP or DEHP kg-1 soil), organic matter contents and water holding contents to simulate the greenhouse soil environment for 30 days. Their influence on the biomass, photosynthetic pigment contents, various physiological changes and soil microbial communities was determined as endpoints. The toxicity to lettuce of DnBP was higher than that of DEHP in the soil and soil pH was the most important factor affecting their single toxicity, followed by soil organic matter content and soil moisture content in agreement with the Biolog test results. Under different soil conditions total protein, total soluble sugar and free amino acid contents were positively correlated with concentrations of the target PAEs, but leaf area, biomass, •O2- activity, vitamin C content and soil microbial diversity indices showed the opposite trend. Chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents were more inhibited by DnBP together with impacts on indices of soil microbial diversity. The results suggest that soil conditions in greenhouses directly explain the patterns of pollutant toxicity displayed and impact the quantity, quality and food safety of vegetables produced using highly intensive production systems."
https://openalex.org/W2950726081,"Research of the central actions of prolactin is highly focused on females, but this hormone has also documented roles in male physiology and behaviour. Here, we provide the first description of the pattern of prolactin-derived signalling in the male mouse brain, employing the immunostaining of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) after exogenous prolactin administration. Next, we explore possible sexually dimorphic differences by comparing pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in prolactin-supplemented males and females. We also assess the role of testosterone in the regulation of central prolactin signalling in males by comparing intact with castrated prolactin-supplemented males. Prolactin-supplemented males displayed a widespread pattern of pSTAT5 immunoreactivity, restricted to brain centres showing expression of the prolactin receptor. Immunoreactivity for pSTAT5 was present in several nuclei of the preoptic, anterior and tuberal hypothalamus, as well as in the septofimbrial nucleus or posterodorsal medial amygdala of the telencephalon. Conversely, non-supplemented control males were virtually devoid of pSTAT5-immunoreactivity, suggesting that central prolactin actions in males are limited to situations concurrent with substantial hypophyseal prolactin release (e.g. stress or mating). Furthermore, comparison of prolactin-supplemented males and females revealed a significant, female-biased sexual dimorphism, supporting the view that prolactin has a preeminent role in female physiology and behaviour. Finally, in males, castration significantly reduced pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in some structures, including the paraventricular and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei and the septofimbrial region, thus indicating a region-specific regulatory role of testosterone over central prolactin signalling."

However, knowledge on the effect of RSM on gut health, especially in relation to changes in gut microbiota is still limited. In our study, Norwegian Landrace weaner pigs were fed with either a control diet (CON) based on wheat, barley and SBM, or a high-fiber experimental diet where SBM was replaced by RSM (RSF). We found no large differences in the gut microbiota of pigs fed the two diets, suggesting that RSF does not disturb the gut microbiota and the normal gut function. The relative abundance of SCFA-producing phylotypes and colon-health related phylotypes increased in the large intestine of RSF-fed pigs. Among them, Lachnospira and Coprococcus were negatively associated with the presence of neutrophils in the colon wall. The higher abundance of these bacteria in colon of RSF pigs may suggest an anti-inflammatory stimulus effect of the RSF diet. The gut microbiota of RSF-fed pigs was relatively unaltered following episodes of diarrhea suggesting that the RSF diet may promote robustness in weaner pigs and reduce the risk of dysbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2906482009,"Future vegetation shifts under changing climate are uncertain for forests with infrequent stand-replacing disturbance regimes. These high-inertia forests may have long persistence even with climate change because disturbance-free periods can span centuries, broad-scale regeneration opportunities are fewer relative to frequent-fire systems, and mature tree species are long-lived with relatively high tolerance for sub-optimal growing conditions. Here, we used a combination of empirical and process-based modeling approaches to examine vegetation projections across high-inertia forests of Washington State, USA, under different climate and wildfire futures. We ran our models without forest management (to assess inherent system behavior/potential) and also with wildfire suppression. Projections suggested relatively stable mid-elevation forests through the end of the century despite anticipated increases in wildfire. The largest changes were projected at the lowest and uppermost forest boundaries, with upward expansion of the driest low-elevation forests and contraction of cold, high-elevation subalpine parklands. While forests were overall relatively stable in simulations, increases in early-seral conditions and decreases in late-seral conditions occurred as wildfire became more frequent. With partial fire suppression, projected changes were dampened or delayed, suggesting a potential tool to forestall change in some (but not all) high-inertia forests, especially since extending fire-free periods does little to alter overall fire regimes in these systems. Model projections also illustrated the importance of fire regime context and projection limitations; the time horizon over which disturbances will eventually allow the system to shift are so long that the prevailing climatic conditions under which many of those shifts will occur are beyond what most climate models can predict with any certainty. This will present a fundamental challenge to setting expectations and managing for long-term change in these systems."
https://openalex.org/W2905753780,"Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the process of identifying an appropriate sense for an ambiguous word. With the complexity of human languages in which a single word could yield different meanings, WSD has been utilized by several domains of interests such as search engines and machine translations. The literature shows a vast number of techniques used for the process of WSD. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of meta-heuristic approaches to identify the best solutions that reflect the best sense. However, the application of meta-heuristic approaches remains limited and thus requires the efficient exploration and exploitation of the problem space. Hence, the current study aims to propose a hybrid meta-heuristic method that consists of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing to find the global best meaning of a given text. Different semantic measures have been utilized in this model as objective functions for the proposed hybrid PSO. These measures consist of JCN and extended Lesk methods, which are combined effectively in this work. The proposed method is tested using a three-benchmark dataset (SemCor 3.0, SensEval-2, and SensEval-3).

https://openalex.org/W2906413580,"An extensive ecological literature applies stable isotope mixing models to derive quantitative dietary reconstructions from isotope ratios of consumer tissues. While this approach works well for some organisms, it is challenging for consumers with complex, varied diets, including humans; indeed, many archaeologists have avoided the use of mixing models because uncertainties in model outputs are sufficiently large that the findings are not helpful in understanding ancient lifeways. Here, we exploit an unparalleled opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of dietary quantification in a nutritionally and isotopically complex context on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Delta values (δ13C and δ15N) of 213 indigenous food samples enable us to characterise four food groups: terrestrial plants, terrestrial vertebrates, marine invertebrates and marine vertebrates. A recent study of baboons that consumed marine and terrestrial foods provides insight into the relationship between such foods and consumer tissue isotopes. We use this information to refine our interpretation of δ15N and especially δ13C in bone collagen from 35 archaeological hunter-gatherers, achieving better estimates of the relative importance of marine and terrestrial foods in the diet than has hitherto been possible. Based on Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (SIMM) outputs, we infer that the trophic enrichment factor (TEF) for δ13Cbone collagen in these coastal humans is closer to +3 than +5‰. In the most 13C- and 15N-rich individuals, 65–98% of bone collagen (95% credible intervals) derived from marine foods. Conversely, in 13C and 15N-poor individuals, 7–44% of bone collagen derived from marine foods. The uncertainties discussed here highlight the need for caution when implementing SIMMs in studies of consumers with complex diets. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the most detailed and most tightly constrained study of this problem to date."

Thus, to discover new antigens to improve the current serological tests for VL diagnosis is urgently needed. Here, we performed an immunogenomic screen strategy to identify conserved linear B-cell epitopes in the predicted L. infantum proteome using the following criteria: i) proteins expressed in the stages found in the vertebrate host, amastigote stage, and secreted/excreted, to guarantee greater exposure to the immune system; ii) divergent from proteins present in other infectious disease pathogens with incidence in endemic areas for VL, as T. cruzi; iii) highly antigenic to humans with different genetic backgrounds, independently of the clinical stage of the disease; iv) stable and adaptable to quality-control tests to guarantee reproducibility; v) using statistical analysis to determine a suitable sample size to evaluate accuracy of diagnostic tests established by receiver operating characteristic strategy. We selected six predicted linear B-cell epitopes from three proteins of L. infantum parasite. The results demonstrated that a mixture of peptides (Mix IV: peptides 3+6) were able to identify VL cases and simultaneously able to discriminate infections caused by T. cruzi parasite with high accuracy (100.00%) and perfect agreement (Kappa index = 1.000) with direct methods performed by laboratories in Brazil. The results also demonstrated that peptide-6, Mix III (peptides 2+6) and I (peptides 2+3+6) are potential antigens able to used in VL diagnosis, represented by high accuracy (Ac = 99.52%, 99.52% and 98.56%, respectively). This study represents an interesting strategy for discovery new antigens applied to serologic diagnosis which will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of VL and, consequently, may help in the prevention, control and treatment of the disease in endemic areas of Brazil."

It is unknown to what extent construction sites create favorable breeding conditions for mosquitoes. The main objectives of the present study were to identify what species of mosquitoes are present at construction sites and the respective physical features associated with their production. Eleven construction sites were cross-sectionally surveyed for the presence of mosquitoes in Miami-Dade County, Florida including in areas previously affected by the Zika virus outbreak in 2016. A total of 3.351 mosquitoes were collected; 2.680 adults and 671 immatures. Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus comprised 95% of all collected mosquitoes and were the only species found in their immature forms breeding inside construction sites. Results for the Shannon and Simpson indices, considering both immature and adult specimens, yielded the highest values for Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti. The individual rarefaction curves indicated that sampling sufficiency was highly asymptotic for Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, and the plots of cumulative species abundance (ln S), Shannon index (H) and log evenness (ln E) (SHE) revealed the lack of heterogeneity of species composition, diversity and evenness for the mosquitoes found breeding in construction sites. The most productive construction site breeding features were elevator shafts, Jersey plastic barriers, flooded floors and stair shafts. The findings of this study indicate that vector mosquitoes breed in high numbers at construction sites and display reduced biodiversity comprising almost exclusively Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Such findings suggest that early phase construction sites have suitable conditions for the proliferation of vector mosquitoes. More studies are needed to identify modifiable worker- and organizational-level factors to improve mosquito control practices and guide future mosquito control strategies in urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W2905887512,"Taphonomic analyses of bone-surface modifications can provide key insights into past biotic involvement with animal remains, as well as elucidate the context(s) of other biostratinomic (pre-burial) processes, diagenesis, excavation, preparation and storage. Such analyses, however, first require researchers to rigorously disambiguate between continuums of damage morphologies prior to attributing individual marks to specific actors and effectors (e.g., carnivore tooth, stone tool cutting edge, etc.). To date, a number of bone-modifying agents have been identified, and criteria for identifying their traces have been published. Relatively little research, however, has focused on bone-surface modifications imparted during specimen preparation. Herein we report that air scribes, small pneumatic tools commonly used for preparation in museum contexts, can generate unintentional marks that may mimic surficial modification caused by carnivores. To aid investigators in assessing the hypothesis that a mark in question is derived from air-scribe preparation activities, we provide high-resolution, detailed morphological information imaged with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The main diagnostic characteristic of air-scribe damage is the occurrence of sequential, variously spaced, sub-millimeter scallop-like stepped bone removals. This morphology can resemble damage imparted by carnivore teeth. In contrast to marks produced by trampling, stone tools and carnivores, however, no continuous internal features, such as linear microstriations, were observed within grooves produced by the air scribe. Thus, the presence of such features can be used to disprove an air-scribe origin. A culmination of the morphological criteria presented herein, cross-cutting relationships with other surficial features (e.g., diagenetic discoloration, weathering textures), the position of occurrence, and an overall contextual framework for the assemblage is suggested for accurate identification of such traces. The ability to recognize or disprove air-scribe damage will allow researchers to confidently proceed with interpreting past biological and sedimentological interactions with animal remains."

Here, using LPS-stimulated THP-1–derived macrophages and murine macrophages along with immunoblotting and immunofluorescence and quantitative analyses, we report that in response to inflammatory stimuli, the coiled-coil protein TRAF3-interacting JNK-activating modulator (T3JAM) associates with TLR4, promotes its translocation to lipid rafts, and thereby enhances macrophage-mediated inflammation. T3JAM overexpression increased and T3JAM depletion decreased TLR4 signaling through both the MyD88-dependent pathway and TLR4 endocytosis. Importantly, deletion or mutation of T3JAM to disrupt its coiled-coil–mediated homoassociation abrogated TLR4 recruitment to lipid rafts. Consistently, T3JAM depletion in mice dampened TLR4 signaling and alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory damage. Collectively, our findings reveal an additional molecular mechanism by which TLR4 activity is regulated and suggest that T3JAM may function as a molecular clamp to “tighten up” TLR4 and facilitate its translocation to lipid rafts.

https://openalex.org/W2906635184,"Most flies of forensic importance are in two superfamilies, the Muscoidea and the Oestroidea, with similar life stages including the puparium. Upon completion of metamorphosis the adult fly emerges from the puparium, leaving behind an exuvia that is of potential significance in forensic investigation. The empty puparium is a durable piece of entomological evidence lasting several years. Through the study of chemical compounds, specifically the hydrocarbons of these puparia, it is possible to identify the species, in addition to how long they have been exposed to weathering and for this reason, these parameters can assist forensic entomologists in estimating long-term postmortem interval (minPMI). In corpses that take a relatively longer time to decompose, insects may use the same corpses for several oviposition cycles. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a new method to determine the PMI based on chemical compounds of the puparia from different oviposition cycles of the fly Chrysomya megacephala. The chemical composition of 50 puparia from different cycles of oviposition were evaluated by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 60 compounds were identified ranging from C18 to C34, 38 of those were common to all generations. Our results demonstrate that chemical profiles can be used to differentiate puparia collected from successive cycles, and therefore valuable in the estimation of minPMI."
https://openalex.org/W2906242563,"Background Exercise training is recommended to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the level of evidence is still low. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared two different and self-administered exercise training programs in a representative CKD population. Methods This single centre RCT included 151 non-dialysis dependent CKD patients, irrespective of age and comorbidity. Self-administered exercise training of 150 minutes per week was prescribed for 4 months and consisted of 60 minutes endurance training in combination with 90 minutes of either strength or balance training (strength versus balance group). Overall endurance (6-minute walk-test (6-MWT), stair climbing), muscular endurance (30-seconds sit-to-stand (30-STS), heel rises and toe lifts, handgrip (HGS) and isometric quadriceps (IQS) strength, balance (functional reach (FR) and Berg´s balance scale (BBS)) and fine motor skills (Moberg´s picking up test (MPUT)) were measured at baseline and after 4 months. Intention to treat analyses with mixed models was used. Results 53 women and 98 men, mean age 66 ± 14: range 19 to 87 years, eGFR 20 ± 7: range 8 to 48 ml/min/1.73m2 participated. The strength group (n = 76) improved significantly in 6-MWT, stair climbing, 30-STS, heel rises right and left, toe lifts right, IQS right and left, and MPUT with closed eyes with the right and left hand. The balance group (n = 75) improved significantly in heel rises right and left, IQS left, BBS and left-handed MPUT with open and closed eyes. A significant effect between the groups was found for IQS right. Conclusions Two different exercise training programs, consisting of endurance in combination with either strength or balance exercise training, improved or maintained overall endurance, muscular strength and endurance, balance and fine motor skills after 4 months of 150 minutes/week self-administered exercise training in a representative CKD population, regardless of age and comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2906169540,"Background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries. It is a multifactorial disease of the retina modified by environmental/individual (e.g. smoking) and genetic factors. 34 independent genomic loci are associated with the risk to develop AMD; an interaction between smoking and genetics is currently investigated. It is unclear how the knowledge on the strong genetic component has entered the knowledge base of practicing ophthalmologists, and how they inform and counsel their (AMD) patients about it. In this study, we explore the ophthalmologists’ view on AMD genetics, and their inclination towards communicating genetic risks to patients. Methods We recruited a purposive sample of thirty German ophthalmologists (office based: n = 15, hospital employees: n = 15, f:8/30), who took part in a recorded semi-standardized interview. Transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. Results The majority of office-based ophthalmologists claimed to be unfamiliar with genetics of AMD, in contrast to hospital-affiliated ophthalmologists. Both office and hospital ophthalmologists were convinced that genetics lacks practical relevance in everyday patient care. Many withhold information on heritability or genetic background of AMD from patients and their relatives, for fear of unsettling those individuals. The relevance of the genetic component of AMD or an individuals’ high genetic risk for prevention, e.g. screening or lifestyle modifications in persons with adverse genetic profile, was rated low. Conclusion Developing genetic educational programs tailored to the routine care of ophthalmologists may be indicated, as well as a better two-way communication between research and practice. Exploring patient views about their expectations to being informed about genetic disease etiology, or about their individual risk, would help inform communication strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2906487581,"High levels of trait impulsivity are considered a risk factor for substance abuse and drug addiction. We recently found that non-planning trait impulsivity was negatively correlated with post-commissural putamen volumes in men, but not women, using the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP). Here, we attempted to replicate this finding in an independent sample using an updated version of the KSP: the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality (SSP). Data from 88 healthy male participants (Mean Age: 28.16±3.34), who provided structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and self-reported SSP impulsivity scores, were analyzed. Striatal sub-region volumes were acquired using the Multiple Automatically Generated Templates (MAGeT-Brain) algorithm. Contrary to our previous findings trait impulsivity measured using SSP was not a significant predictor of post-commissural putamen volumes (β = .14, df = 84, p = .94). A replication Bayes Factors analysis strongly supported this null result. Consistent with our previous findings, secondary exploratory analyses found no relationship between ventral striatum volumes and SSP trait impulsivity (β = -.05, df = 84, p = .28). An exploratory analysis of the other striatal compartments showed that there were no significant associations with trait impulsivity. While we could not replicate our previous findings in the current sample, we believe this work will aide future studies aimed at establishing meaningful brain biomarkers for addiction vulnerability in healthy humans."
https://openalex.org/W2906570295,"Populations may become isolated by distance, geographic barriers or both. Isolated populations often diverge in behavioral, morphological and genetic traits as a result of reduced inter-population gene flow. Highland species commonly present naturally fragmented distributions that confine populations to the highest mountain peaks, isolated by mountain passes and distance. The endemic Timberline Wren (Thryorchilus browni) inhabits the highlands of the Talamanca mountain range, including western Panama, and the highest peak in the Central Volcanic mountain range of Costa Rica. Using microsatellites and song recordings we studied the effect of a geographic barrier and distance on song, genetic and morphological divergence among four populations in Costa Rica. A lowland mountain pass resulted in the largest genetic, vocal, and morphological (bill length) differences among populations, likely due to reduce the gene flow. Cultural drift and assortative mating by females selecting songs from their own population likely accentuates the effect of isolation and limited gene flow between populations. This pattern of population divergence has been found in other Neotropical highland birds, but over larger geographical scales. We conclude that mountain passes and distance both reduce gene flow between populations in recently-isolated highland species with restricted distributions."
https://openalex.org/W2906599924,"Purpose This paper lays the groundwork for linking Hounsfield unit measurements to the International System of Units (SI), ultimately enabling traceable measurements across X-ray CT (XCT) machines. We do this by characterizing a material basis that may be used in XCT reconstruction giving linear combinations of concentrations of chemical elements (in the SI units of mol/m3) which may be observed at each voxel. By implication, linear combinations not in the set are not observable. Methods and materials We formulated a model for our material basis with a set of measurements of elemental powders at four tube voltages, 80 kV, 100 kV, 120 kV, and 140 kV, on a medical XCT. The samples included 30 small plastic bottles of powders containing various compounds spanning the atomic numbers up to 20, and a bottle of water and one of air. Using the chemical formulas and measured masses, we formed a matrix giving the number of Hounsfield units per (mole per cubic meter) at each tube voltage for each of 13 chemical elements. We defined a corresponding matrix in units we call molar Hounsfield unit (HU) potency, the difference in HU values that an added mole per cubic meter in a given voxel would add to the measured HU value. We built a matrix of molar potencies for each chemical element and tube voltage and performed a singular value decomposition (SVD) on these to formulate our material basis. We determined that the dimension of this basis is two. We then compared measurements in this material space with theoretical measurements, combining XCOM cross section data with the tungsten anode spectral model using interpolating cubic splines (TASMICS), a one-parameter filter, and a simple detector model, creating a matrix similar to our experimental matrix for the first 20 chemical elements. Finally, we compared the model predictions to Hounsfield unit measurements on three XCT calibration phantoms taken from the literature. Results We predict the experimental HU potency values derived from our scans of chemical elements with our theoretical model built from XCOM data. The singular values and singular vectors of the model and powder measurements are in substantial agreement. Application of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) shows that exactly two singular values and singular vectors describe the results over four tube voltages. We give a good account of the HU values from the literature, measured for the calibration phantoms at several tube voltages for several commercial instruments, compared with our theoretical model without introducing additional parameters. Conclusions We have developed a two-dimensional material basis that specifies the degree to which individual elements in compounds effect the HU values in XCT images of samples with elements up to atomic number Z = 20. We show that two dimensions is sufficient given the contrast and noise in our experiment. The linear combination of concentrations of elements that can be observed using a medical XCT have been characterized, providing a material basis for use in dual-energy reconstruction. This approach provides groundwork for improved reconstruction and for the link of Hounsfield units to the SI."
https://openalex.org/W2905903513,"Introduction [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC and [18F]DCFPyL show a high potential for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer. While 18F-based tracers have several advantages in availability and image resolution, their sensitivity in the skeleton might be impaired by released [18F]fluoride due to its high bone affinity. In turn, chemically unbound trivalent 68Ga might also accumulate in osseous tissue, in cases of occupied binding sites of plasma proteins and thereby influence bone signal. Methods A comparison of average bone SUV was performed in 17 bone-negative and 4 bone-positive patients. All patients underwent PET/CT 125 minutes after application of [18F]DCFPyL and 73 minutes after application of [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC at another date. Results Native SUVs in unaffected bone tissue and SUVs relative to liver uptake were lower in [18F]DCFPyL (0.49) than in [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC scans (0.52). SUVs relative to gluteal muscles did not differ between the two tracers. Average lesional SUVs did not differ between tracers. Conclusion No difference of average bone signal intensity was observed for [18F]DCFPyL-PET/CT in comparison to [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC scans indicating that diagnostic assessment of the skeleton is not affected by non-specific accumulation of free [18F]fluoride or 68Ga."
https://openalex.org/W2906303851,"The fertility of men with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is reduced. Despite this observation, gonadal function has not been examined in patients with NF1. In order to assess the role of reduced neurofibromin in the testes, we examined testicular morphology and function in an Nf1+/- mouse model. We found that although Nf1+/- male mice are able to reproduce, they have significantly fewer pups per litter than Nf1+/+ control males. Reduced fertility in Nf1+/- male mice is associated with disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium, with exfoliation of germ cells and immature spermatids into the tubule lumen. Morphometric analysis shows that these alterations are associated with decreased Leydig cell numbers and increased spermatid cell numbers. We hypothesized that hyper-activation of Ras in Nf1+/- males affects ectoplasmic specialization, a Sertoli-spermatid adherens junction involved in spermiation. Consistent with this idea, we found increased expression of phosphorylated ERK, a downstream effector of Ras that has been shown to alter ectoplasmic specialization, in Nf1+/- males in comparison to control Nf1+/+ littermates. These data demonstrate that neurofibromin haploinsufficiency impairs spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model of NF1."
https://openalex.org/W2906468421,"Epigenome-wide association studies seek to identify DNA methylation sites associated with clinical outcomes. Difference in observed methylation between specific cell-subtypes is often of interest; however, available samples often comprise a mixture of cells. To date, cell-subtype estimates have been obtained from mixed-cell DNA data using linear regression models, but the accuracy of such estimates has not been critically assessed. We evaluated linear regression performance for cell-subtype specific methylation estimation using a 450K methylation array dataset of both mixed-cell and cell-subtype sorted samples from six healthy males. CpGs associated with each cell-subtype were first identified using t-tests between groups of cell-subtype sorted samples. Subsequent reduced panels of reliably accurate CpGs were identified from mixed-cell samples using an accuracy heuristic (D). Performance was assessed by comparing cell-subtype specific estimates from mixed-cells with corresponding cell-sorted mean using the mean absolute error (MAE) and the Coefficient of Determination (R2). At the cell-subtype level, methylation levels at 3272 CpGs could be estimated to within a MAE of 5% of the expected value. The cell-subtypes with the highest accuracy were CD56+ NK (R2 = 0.56) and CD8+T (R2 = 0.48), where 23% of sites were accurately estimated. Hierarchical clustering and pathways enrichment analysis confirmed the biological relevance of the panels. Our results suggest that linear regression for cell-subtype specific methylation estimation is accurate only for some cell-subtypes at a small fraction of cell-associated sites but may be applicable to EWASs of disease traits with a blood-based pathology. Although sample size was a limitation in this study, we suggest that alternative statistical methods will provide the greatest performance improvements."

https://openalex.org/W2906359256,"In most vertebrate animals, glucocorticoid hormones are the chief mediators of homeostasis in response to ecological conditions and as they progress through their lifecycle. In addition, glucocorticoids are a major part of the stress response and stress induced elevations of the hormone can make it difficult to assess glucocorticoid secretion in response to changes in life-stage and current environmental conditions in wild animals. Particularly when quantifying circulating levels of glucocorticoids in the blood which fluctuate rapidly in response to stress. An alternative method of quantifying glucocorticoids is as hormone metabolites in faeces or urine giving a historical sample related to the gut passage time and urinary tract that is less sensitive to stressful events which cause spikes in the circulating hormone level. Although the concentration of glucocorticoid metabolites are influenced by faecal mass thereby potentially affecting any differences in hormone metabolites detected amongst samples. In the present study, we aimed to detect changes in levels of corticosterone, the primary bird glucocorticoid, in relation to the phase of reproduction, in a breeding population of collared flycatchers by sampling corticosterone metabolites in droppings. We also tested how corticosterone metabolite concentrations were affected by ambient temperature and related to body condition in adult birds. Our results indicate that the upregulation of corticosterone between incubation and nestling feeding in female birds is crucial for successful reproduction in this species. Also, females appear to downregulate corticosterone during incubation in response to lower ambient temperature and poorer body condition. Our results did not indicate a relationship between dropping mass and corticosterone metabolite concentrations, which suggests that our findings were linked to the regulation of corticosterone in response to predictable and unpredictable challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2906567090,"Purpose During total knee arthroplasty, few rotating reference axes can be reliably used after tibial resection. We speculated that a line that passes through the lateral edge of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) at its tibial attachment after resection and the most prominent point of the tibial tubercle [after-tibial resection (ATR) line] will provide a good reference axis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between ATR and Akagi’s lines. Materials and methods In this case–control simulation study, we retrospectively evaluated 38 patients with varus knee and 28 patients with valgus knee. We defined the reference cutting plane as 10 mm distal from the lateral articular surface of the tibia in varus group and as 7 mm distal from the medial articular surface in the valgus group. We measured angles between Akagi’s line and the ATR line (ATR line angle) as well as between Akagi’s line and 1/3 Akagi’s line (1/3 Akagi’s line angle), which passes through the midpoint of PCL and the medial third of the patellar tendon. We used paired t-tests to determine the significance of differences between these angles, with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Intra- and interclass correlation coefficients for the reproducibility of 1/3 Akagi’s line angle and ATR line angle were analyzed by two surgeons. Results We found that 1/3 Akagi’s line angle was 10.2° ± 1.3° in the varus group and 10.9° ± 1.3° in the valgus group (p = 0.017). The ATR line was positioned externally compared with Akagi’s line in all patients. Mean ATR line angles at 0°, 3° and 7° posterior slopes were 6.1° ± 1.9°, 5.8° ± 2.0° and 6.0° ± 1.7° in the varus group and 6.3° ± 2.3°, 6.2° ± 2.3° and 5.4° ± 2.1° in the valgus group, respectively. There were no significant differences in the ATR line angle between the varus and valgus groups. (p = 0.34–0.67) Intra- and interclass correlation coefficients for the reproducibility of 1/3 Akagi’s line angle were 0.936 and 0.986 and those for the reproducibility of ATR line angle were 0.811 and 0.839. Conclusions The ATR line was positioned between Akagi’s line and 1/3 Akagi’s line in all patients and was a valid option for evaluating rotational tibial alignment after tibial resection."

https://openalex.org/W2906125762,"Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common postoperative complications experienced by older patients after anesthesia and surgery but the cause remains unknown. Immune molecules are essential for many aspects of neural homeostasis, including learning and memory, and an imbalance in immune neuromodulators is implicated in the development of neural dysfunction. Aging alters the control of neuroinflammatory cascades and general anesthetics are immunosuppressants. Therefore, we hypothesized that general anesthesia disturbs neuroimmune signaling in an age-dependent fashion. We tested this hypothesis by examining gene expression of key immune neuromodulators including IL-1β, TNFα, and CCL2 in the hippocampus of young adult (3 mo) and aged (20 mo) mice following isoflurane anesthesia. We show that isoflurane anesthesia increases expression of these signaling molecules in the hippocampus of young adult mice but decreases it in the hippocampus of old mice. Furthermore, anesthetized old mice had an amplified hippocampal neuroimmune response to systemically administered lipopolysaccharide compared to age-matched carrier controls. Together, these data indicate that isoflurane anesthesia disrupts hippocampal neuroimmune mediator gene expression in the old brain and suggests a potential mechanism by which general anesthesia can contribute to disordered neuronal homeostasis and post-anesthesia cognitive disability in older subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2906198162,"Activation induced deaminase (AID) has two distinct and well defined roles, both relying on its deoxycytidine (dC) deaminating function: one as a DNA mutator and another in DNA demethylation. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), AID was previously shown to be an independent negative prognostic factor. While there is substantial impact on DNA mutations, effects of AID on gene expression by promoter demethylation of disease related target genes in leukemia has not been addressed. To shed light on this question, we aimed at determining genome wide methylation changes as well as gene expression changes in response to AID expression in CLL. Although we found minor differences in individual methylation variable positions following AID expression, we could not find recurrent methylation changes of specific target sites or changes in global methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2906508443,"Small-scale fisheries are large contributors to regional economies and livelihoods in coastal communities of Latin America. While Mexico is one of the cases where small-scale fisheries play an important role, overfishing and poor management strategies have led to the collapse of many of its fisheries. The callo de hacha scallop fishery of the Ensenada de La Paz in Baja California Sur is an example of such a fishery which, after years of mismanagement, was closed by the Mexican authorities in 2009. The present study evaluated the recovery efforts in the cove and the potential outcomes of a collaboration between a non-governmental organization and a fishing community working towards the restoration of this pen-shell fishery. After more than four years of closure and active monitoring of the recovering process, the callo de hacha population has shown a significant population recovery, with potential solvency for reopening fishing activities. Four scenarios of uncertainty are evaluated with two of them providing positive net present values from reopening the fishery. We also document the involvement of a non-governmental organization with a fishing community, which created social capital and, in our opinion, was essential for a successful restoration. Having an actively involved community helped raise funds for the fishing closure so fishers were able to comply with Mexican legislation; it also fostered community building and self-organization that will be crucial to maintaining the sustainability of the fishery."

All subjects underwent NCV examination at median and tibial nerves as motor nerve (MCV) as well as median and sural nerves as sensory nerve (SCV). Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were evaluated as arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis parameters.Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that NCV at all sites negatively correlated with baPWV, maximal and mean IMT (IMT-Max and IMT-Mean), and plaque score (all p values p<0.01 at least). Multiple regression analyses adjusted for confounding factors such as age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, HbA1c, fasting C-peptide, systolic blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and albuminuria showed that the association of NCV with IMT-Max, ITM-Mean, and plaque score remained significant (all p values p<0.05 at least) except that between SCV at median and IMT-Max. Moreover, SCV at median (forearm) and sural were significantly associated with baPWV (p = 0.023 and p = 0.027, respectively).The present study showed that DPN estimated by quantitative NCV is linearly associated with the deterioration of arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis parameters in T2DM independently of various diabetic and atherosclerotic factors."

In this work we describe a detailed expression analysis of Grg1-4 family members during embryonic neurogenesis in the developing murine telencephalon. Grg1-4 presented a unique, complex yet overlapping expression pattern; Grg1 and Grg3 were mainly detected in the proliferative zones of the telencephalon, Grg2 mainly in the subpallium and finally, Grg4 mainly in the subpallial post mitotic neurons. In addition, comparative analysis of the expression of Grg1-4 revealed that, at these stages, distinct telencephalic progenitor domains or structures are characterized by the presence of different combinations of Grg repressors, thus forming a ""Grg-mediated repression map""."

My manager's decision planted a seed of self-doubt. Was he right? Was I asking for too much? But I reminded myself that I had already proved I could be an effective scientist on a part-time schedule. During my 7 years as a university researcher working part time—a common choice among working mothers in the Netherlands—my career had flourished. With rigorous time management and organization, I got at least as much good work done in 4 days a week as others did on full-time schedules.

When I left my university post for the biotech company, spurred by the desire for my work to reach patients, I expected that I would be able to grow professionally and advance my career there. I had the impression that the company valued performance and ambition. But now I was being told that I should be happy in my current role as a troubleshooter, rather than the project leader I aspired to be.

A friend suggested that I reach out to senior managers about opportunities in other departments. At first, I resolutely rejected that idea. Didn't he understand? I wanted to work on antibodies and nothing but antibodies! That was what I knew, where I felt I could add the most value. And yet, I did not want to leave this cool company just because of one unsupportive manager.

With little expectation that it would lead anywhere, I approached the three senior managers. One did not respond. One had nothing to offer. The third invited me to chat. He patiently listened to my story, asked what I was looking for, and then—in the blink of an eye—told me that I was welcome to join him in building a vaccine research unit. I stuttered that I knew nothing about vaccines. He waved nonchalantly and said, “You will learn. You are smart and willing to work hard. You will make it.”

The reassurance was exactly what I had been looking for, but I was still shaken by my manager's lack of confidence in me. Could I really handle a high-responsibility role in a completely new field?

A few sleepless nights later, I decided that taking a chance on the unknown was better than staying in a position that made me miserable. The worst thing that could happen was that I would fail. But I already felt like a failure, so why not try it?

I soon discovered a new passion. My career path within the company opened up. I took on more responsibilities, developed new skills, expanded my scientific horizons, worked with great people, and led fantastic projects—all because of a change that had felt forced on me. It had pushed me further than I was willing to go, further than I thought I could cope with, and taught me that when I step out of my comfort zone, I find my most creative, productive self.

More than 10 years later, antibodies—my scientific “first love”—crossed my path again in the form of an exciting, challenging position that demanded a major life change, complicated by my recent divorce. I would have to leave my home and community, start again in another country, and find a way to co-parent across borders. After many discussions, I asked my son whether he would go abroad with me. Without lifting his eyes from his Minecraft game, he responded, “ Pourquoi pas ?” I couldn't have said it better myself.
