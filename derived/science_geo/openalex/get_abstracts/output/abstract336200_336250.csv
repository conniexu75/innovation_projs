https://openalex.org/W2150881469,"Caterpillars of the spring brood of Nemoria arizonaria develop into mimics of the oak catkins upon which they feed. Caterpillars from the summer brood emerge after the catkins have fallen and they develop instead into mimics of oak twigs. This developmental polymorphism may be triggered by the concentration of defensive secondary compounds in the larval diet: all caterpillars raised on catkins, which are low in tannin, developed into catkin morphs; those raised on leaves, which are high in tannin, developed into twig morphs; most raised on artificial diets of catkins with elevated tannin concentrations developed into twig morphs."
https://openalex.org/W1966560370,Mitochondrial DNA from the extinct dusky seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens) was compared in terms of nucleotide sequence divergence to mitochondrial DNAs from extant populations of seaside sparrows. Analyses of restriction sites revealed a close phylogenetic affinity of A. m. nigrescens to other sparrow populations along the Atlantic coast of the United States but considerable genetic distance from Gulf coast birds. Concerns and applied management strategies for the seaside sparrow have been based on a morphological taxonomy that does not adequately reflect evolutionary relationships within the complex.
https://openalex.org/W2093793589,"The next generation of efficient turbines and engines will require materials that can withstand operating temperatures approaching 2000 degrees C. Intermetallic compounds with high melting temperatures are candidates for this application, but the obstacle of their limited ductility must first be overcome. Because the available data on these materials is limited, a survey of the effects of chemistry and crystal structure must be performed. With the use of melting temperature and density as figures of merit, the most likely candidates have been identified for preliminary screening."
https://openalex.org/W2085498651,"Coral islands drown when sea level rise exceeds the maximum potential of coral reefs to grow upward (about 10 millimeters per year). During the Holocene transgression (18,000 years ago to present) sea levels rose at rates of up to 10 to 20 millimeters per year, and most coral island reefs situated deeper than a critical depth of30 to 40 meters below present day sea level drowned. Coral islands that did not drown during the Holocene transgression apparently all developed on antecedent foundations shallower than critical depth. During low stands in sea level during the Pleistocene, these islands were elevated and subject to subaerial erosion. Today, in the Hawaiian Archipelago, the depth of drowned banks is inversely related to summit area; smaller banks are progressively deeper, evidently because of erosional truncation during low sea level stands. Bank summit area may therefore be an important factor determining the failure or success of coral islands."

https://openalex.org/W1983274772,"Long-term data on U.S. productivity growth show its enormous contribution to U.S. living standards but do not confirm fears that the country is losing its manufacturing jobs to other countries. Growth in U.S. manufacturing productivity shows no downward trend; the U.S. share of world manufacturing employment is rising and, although the share of U.S. service sector jobs has increased, that in Japan has risen three times as quickly. The threats to U.S. productivity growth are mostly shorter term, for example, the federal deficit that absorbs savings which would otherwise be used to modernize and expand plant and equipment."

https://openalex.org/W2087532431,"This response to a letter re-emphasizes the purpose of the Workshop on the First Detection of Carbon Dioxide Effects which, was to outline a research and analysis program that would provide the information needed to address more completely the issue of CO/sub 2/ warming of the environment and to determine ... whether or not (the climate models) may be grossly in error. The approach proposed by the Workshop participants indicated that definitive conclusions about climatic change should be based on correlated changes in an array of variables, rather than on selected changes in any single variable. A three-pronged effort was outlined to accomplish this objective."
