https://openalex.org/W1749057191,"Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy disorders for which the cause is often unknown1. Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10−3). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10−10 and P = 7.8 × 10−12, respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P < 10−8), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders2."

The Cas9 system has been used to modify genomes in multiple cells and organisms, demonstrating its potential as a facile genome-engineering tool. We used in vitro selection and high-throughput sequencing to determine the propensity of eight guide-RNA:Cas9 complexes to cleave each of 10(12) potential off-target DNA sequences. The selection results predicted five off-target sites in the human genome that were confirmed to undergo genome cleavage in HEK293T cells upon expression of one of two guide-RNA:Cas9 complexes. In contrast to previous models, our results show that guide-RNA:Cas9 specificity extends past a 7- to 12-base-pair seed sequence. Our results also suggest a tradeoff between activity and specificity both in vitro and in cells as a shorter, less-active guide RNA is more specific than a longer, more-active guide RNA. High concentrations of guide-RNA:Cas9 complexes can cleave off-target sites containing mutations near or within the PAM that are not cleaved when enzyme concentrations are limiting."
https://openalex.org/W2031047943,"During the inflammatory response that drives atherogenesis, macrophages accumulate progressively in the expanding arterial wall. The observation that circulating monocytes give rise to lesional macrophages has reinforced the concept that monocyte infiltration dictates macrophage buildup. Recent work has indicated, however, that macrophage accumulation does not depend on monocyte recruitment in some inflammatory contexts. We therefore revisited the mechanism underlying macrophage accumulation in atherosclerosis. In murine atherosclerotic lesions, we found that macrophages turn over rapidly, after 4 weeks. Replenishment of macrophages in these experimental atheromata depends predominantly on local macrophage proliferation rather than monocyte influx. The microenvironment orchestrates macrophage proliferation through the involvement of scavenger receptor A (SR-A). Our study reveals macrophage proliferation as a key event in atherosclerosis and identifies macrophage self-renewal as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease."

https://openalex.org/W2094118946,"Expression of long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory requires protein synthesis, which can be repressed by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α-subunit (eIF2α). Elevated phosphorylation of eIF2α has been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and Alzheimer's disease model mice. Therefore, we tested whether suppressing eIF2α kinases could alleviate synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Genetic deletion of eIF2α kinase PERK prevented enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2α and deficits in protein synthesis, synaptic plasticity and spatial memory in mice that express familial Alzheimer's disease–related mutations in APP and PSEN1. Similarly, deletion of another eIF2α kinase, GCN2, prevented impairments of synaptic plasticity and defects in spatial memory exhibited by the Alzheimer's disease model mice. Our findings implicate aberrant eIF2α phosphorylation as a previously unidentified molecular mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease–related synaptic pathophysioloy and memory dysfunction and suggest that PERK and GCN2 are potential therapeutic targets for treatment of individuals with Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1966181749,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hepatokine that acts as a global starvation signal to modulate fuel partitioning and metabolism and repress growth; however, the site of action of these diverse effects remains unclear. FGF21 signals through a heteromeric cell-surface receptor composed of one of three FGF receptors (FGFR1c, FGFR2c or FGFR3c) in complex with β-Klotho, a single-pass transmembrane protein that is enriched in metabolic tissues. Here we show that in addition to its known effects on peripheral metabolism, FGF21 increases systemic glucocorticoid levels, suppresses physical activity and alters circadian behavior, which are all features of the adaptive starvation response. These effects are mediated through β-Klotho expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and the dorsal vagal complex of the hindbrain. Mice lacking the gene encoding β-Klotho (Klb) in these regions are refractory to these effects, as well as those on metabolism, insulin and growth. These findings demonstrate a crucial role for the nervous system in mediating the diverse physiologic and pharmacologic actions of FGF21."

https://openalex.org/W1991494425,"Progress in adoptive T-cell therapy for cancer and infectious diseases is hampered by the lack of readily available, antigen-specific, human T lymphocytes. Pluripotent stem cells could provide an unlimited source of T lymphocytes, but the therapeutic potential of human pluripotent stem cell-derived lymphoid cells generated to date remains uncertain. Here we combine induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technologies to generate human T cells targeted to CD19, an antigen expressed by malignant B cells, in tissue culture. These iPSC-derived, CAR-expressing T cells display a phenotype resembling that of innate γδ T cells. Similar to CAR-transduced, peripheral blood γδ T cells, the iPSC-derived T cells potently inhibit tumor growth in a xenograft model. This approach of generating therapeutic human T cells 'in the dish' may be useful for cancer immunotherapy and other medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2002896974,"Heather Mefford, Ingrid Scheffer and colleagues report the identification of inherited mutations in GRIN2A that cause epilepsy-aphasia syndromes, which have a characteristic EEG pattern and developmental regression affecting language. Epilepsy-aphasia syndromes (EAS) are a group of rare, severe epileptic encephalopathies of unknown etiology with a characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern and developmental regression particularly affecting language. Rare pathogenic deletions that include GRIN2A have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. We sought to delineate the pathogenic role of GRIN2A in 519 probands with epileptic encephalopathies with diverse epilepsy syndromes. We identified four probands with GRIN2A variants that segregated with the disorder in their families. Notably, all four families presented with EAS, accounting for 9% of epilepsy-aphasia cases. We did not detect pathogenic variants in GRIN2A in other epileptic encephalopathies (n = 475) nor in probands with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (n = 81). We report the first monogenic cause, to our knowledge, for EAS. GRIN2A mutations are restricted to this group of cases, which has important ramifications for diagnostic testing and treatment and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of this debilitating group of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2039814229,"Cortical neurons in thalamic recipient layers receive excitation from the thalamus and the cortex. The relative contribution of these two sources of excitation to sensory tuning is poorly understood. We optogenetically silenced the visual cortex of mice to isolate thalamic excitation onto layer 4 neurons during visual stimulation. Thalamic excitation contributed to a third of the total excitation and was organized in spatially offset, yet overlapping, ON and OFF receptive fields. This receptive field structure predicted the orientation tuning of thalamic excitation. Finally, both thalamic and total excitation were similarly tuned to orientation and direction and had the same temporal phase relationship to the visual stimulus. Our results indicate that tuning of thalamic excitation is unlikely to be imparted by direction- or orientation-selective thalamic neurons and that a principal role of cortical circuits is to amplify tuned thalamic excitation."
https://openalex.org/W2012073519,"Hydrogenases catalyze the formation of hydrogen. The cofactor ('H-cluster') of [FeFe]-hydrogenases consists of a [4Fe-4S] cluster bridged to a unique [2Fe] subcluster whose biosynthesis in vivo requires hydrogenase-specific maturases. Here we show that a chemical mimic of the [2Fe] subcluster can reconstitute apo-hydrogenase to full activity, independent of helper proteins. The assembled H-cluster is virtually indistinguishable from the native cofactor. This procedure will be a powerful tool for developing new artificial H₂-producing catalysts."

https://openalex.org/W1965641455,"Mutations in the gene encoding the F-box domain–containing protein Fbxo7 are genetically associated to an autosomal recessive form of early-onset Parkinson's disease of similar severity to those caused by Parkinson's disease–linked mutations in the genes for the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 or the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Burchell et al. show that Fbxo7 acts in a common cellular and molecular pathway with Parkin and PINK1 in autophagic clearance of mitochondria in response to mitochondrial depolarization and damage. Compelling evidence indicates that two autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease genes, PINK1 (PARK6) and Parkin (PARK2), cooperate to mediate the autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy). Mutations in the F-box domain–containing protein Fbxo7 (encoded by PARK15) also cause early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that Fbxo7 participates in mitochondrial maintenance through direct interaction with PINK1 and Parkin and acts in Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Cells with reduced Fbxo7 expression showed deficiencies in translocation of Parkin to mitochondria, ubiquitination of mitofusin 1 and mitophagy. In Drosophila, ectopic overexpression of Fbxo7 rescued loss of Parkin, supporting a functional relationship between the two proteins. Parkinson's disease–causing mutations in Fbxo7 interfered with this process, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047483303,"Nervous systems process information by integrating the electrical activity of neurons in complex networks. This motivates the long-standing interest in using optical methods to simultaneously monitor the membrane potential of multiple genetically targeted neurons via expression of genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators (GEVIs) in intact neural circuits. No currently available GEVIs have demonstrated robust signals in intact brain tissue that enable reliable recording of individual electrical events simultaneously in multiple neurons. Here, we show that the recently developed ""ArcLight"" GEVI robustly reports both subthreshold events and action potentials in genetically targeted neurons in the intact Drosophila fruit fly brain and reveals electrical signals in neurite branches. In the same way that genetically encoded fluorescent sensors have revolutionized the study of intracellular Ca(2+) signals, ArcLight now enables optical measurement in intact neural circuits of membrane potential, the key cellular parameter that underlies neuronal information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2007284471,"Skeletal muscle contains Pax7-expressing muscle stem or satellite cells, enabling muscle regeneration throughout most of adult life. Here, we demonstrate that induced inactivation of Pax7 in Pax7-expressing cells of adult mice leads to loss of muscle stem cells and reduced heterochromatin condensation in rare surviving satellite cells. Inactivation of Pax7 in Myf5-expressing cells revealed that the majority of adult muscle stem cells originate from myogenic lineages, which express the myogenic regulators Myf5 or MyoD. Likewise, the majority of muscle stem cells are replenished from Myf5-expressing myogenic cells during adult life, and inactivation of Pax7 in Myf5-expressing cells after muscle damage leads to a complete arrest of muscle regeneration. Finally, we demonstrate that a relatively small number of muscle stem cells are sufficient for efficient repair of skeletal muscles. We conclude that Pax7 acts at different levels in a nonhierarchical regulatory network controlling muscle-satellite-cell-mediated muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1963690531,"Preventing reproduction during nutritional deprivation is an adaptive process that is conserved and essential for the survival of species. In mammals, the mechanisms that inhibit fertility during starvation are complex and incompletely understood. Here we show that exposure of female mice to fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a fasting-induced hepatokine, mimics infertility secondary to starvation. Mechanistically, FGF21 acts on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus to suppress the vasopressin-kisspeptin signaling cascade, thereby inhibiting the proestrus surge in luteinizing hormone. Mice lacking the FGF21 co-receptor, β-Klotho, in the SCN are refractory to the inhibitory effect of FGF21 on female fertility. Thus, FGF21 defines an important liver-neuroendocrine axis that modulates female reproduction in response to nutritional challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2028997870,"Cells expressing variable lymphocyte receptor C (VLRC) genes that encode VLRC receptors, which are used by jawless vertebrates to react with antigens, are defined as a second T-cell-like lymphocyte subset (the first being VLRA-bearing cells); distinct properties of these two T-cell-like subsets are reminiscent of the distinction between αβ and γδ T cells in jawed vertebrates. The jawless vertebrates have an adaptive immune system that uses somatically diversified leucine-rich repeat receptors (VLRs) to recognize antigens, rather than the T- and B-cell receptors of jawed vertebrates. However the VLRB- and VLRA-bearing cells have features that resemble B and T cells, respectively. This study defines a third lineage of lymphocytes in a jawless vertebrate — the lamprey — that expresses the recently described VLRC receptors. The differences between the lamprey's two T-cell-like lymphocyte subsets echo the distinction between the αβ and γδ T-cell lineages of jawed vertebrates, suggesting that functional specialization of distinct T-cell-like lineages was an ancient feature of a primordial immune system. Jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes) have different adaptive immune systems1,2. Gnathostomes use T- and B-cell antigen receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily3,4. Cyclostomes, the lampreys and hagfish, instead use leucine-rich repeat proteins to construct variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), two types of which, VLRA and VLRB, are reciprocally expressed by lymphocytes resembling gnathostome T and B cells5,6,7. Here we define another lineage of T-cell-like lymphocytes that express the recently identified VLRC receptors8,9. Both VLRC+ and VLRA+ lymphocytes express orthologues of genes that gnathostome γδ and αβ T cells use for their differentiation, undergo VLRC and VLRA assembly and repertoire diversification in the ‘thymoid’ gill region, and express their VLRs solely as cell-surface proteins. Our findings suggest that the genetic programmes for two primordial T-cell lineages and a prototypic B-cell lineage were already present in the last common vertebrate ancestor approximately 500 million years ago. We propose that functional specialization of distinct T-cell-like lineages was an ancient feature of a primordial immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1974203453,"Numerous transcriptional regulators of neurogenesis have been identified in the developing and adult brain, but how neurogenic fate is programmed at the epigenetic level remains poorly defined. Here, we report that the transcription factor Pax6 directly interacts with the Brg1-containing BAF complex in adult neural progenitors. Deletion of either Brg1 or Pax6 in the subependymal zone (SEZ) causes the progeny of adult neural stem cells to convert to the ependymal lineage within the SEZ while migrating neuroblasts convert to different glial lineages en route to or in the olfactory bulb (OB). Genome-wide analyses reveal that the majority of genes downregulated in the Brg1 null SEZ and OB contain Pax6 binding sites and are also downregulated in Pax6 null SEZ and OB. Downstream of the Pax6-BAF complex, we find that Sox11, Nfib, and Pou3f4 form a transcriptional cross-regulatory network that drives neurogenesis and can convert postnatal glia into neurons. Taken together, elements of our work identify a tripartite effector network activated by Pax6-BAF that programs neuronal fate."
https://openalex.org/W2042209114,"Biomarkers that predict disease progression might assist the development of better therapeutic strategies for aggressive cancers, such as ovarian cancer. Here, we investigated the role of collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1) in cell invasiveness and tumor formation and the prognostic impact of COL11A1 expression in ovarian cancer. Microarray analysis suggested that COL11A1 is a disease progression-associated gene that is linked to ovarian cancer recurrence and poor survival. Small interference RNA-mediated specific reduction in COL11A1 protein levels suppressed the invasive ability and oncogenic potential of ovarian cancer cells and decreased tumor formation and lung colonization in mouse xenografts. A combination of experimental approaches, including real-time RT–PCR, casein zymography and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, showed that COL11A1 knockdown attenuated MMP3 expression and suppressed binding of Ets-1 to its putative MMP3 promoter-binding site, suggesting that the Ets-1–MMP3 axis is upregulated by COL11A1. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (TGF-β1) treatment triggers the activation of smad2 signaling cascades, leading to activation of COL11A1 and MMP3. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP3 abrogated the TGF-β1-triggered, COL11A1-dependent cell invasiveness. Furthermore, the NF-YA-binding site on the COL11A1 promoter was identified as the major determinant of TGF-β1-dependent COL11A1 activation. Analysis of 88 ovarian cancer patients indicated that high COL11A1 mRNA levels are associated with advanced disease stage. The 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were significantly lower (P=0.006 and P=0.018, respectively) among patients with high expression levels of tissue COL11A1 mRNA compared with those with low expression. We conclude that COL11A1 may promote tumor aggressiveness via the TGF-β1–MMP3 axis and that COL11A1 expression can predict clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1997221105,"By silencing intracortical excitation in mouse primary visual cortex, Li and colleagues find that the tuning of layer 4 pyramidal cells is independent of cortico-cortical inputs. Instead, intracortical excitation amplifies thalamocortical signals and expands the spatial receptive field of layer 4 neurons. Neurons in thalamorecipient layers of sensory cortices integrate thalamocortical and intracortical inputs. Although we know that their functional properties can arise from the convergence of thalamic inputs, intracortical circuits could also be involved in thalamocortical transformations of sensory information. We silenced intracortical excitatory circuits with optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex and compared visually evoked thalamocortical input with total excitation in the same layer 4 pyramidal neurons. We found that intracortical excitatory circuits preserved the orientation and direction tuning of thalamocortical excitation, with a linear amplification of thalamocortical signals of about threefold. The spatial receptive field of thalamocortical input was slightly elongated and was expanded by intracortical excitation in an approximately proportional manner. Thus, intracortical excitatory circuits faithfully reinforce the representation of thalamocortical information and may influence the size of the receptive field by recruiting additional inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2074299407,"During natural vision, humans categorize the scenes they encounter: an office, the beach, and so on. These categories are informed by knowledge of the way that objects co-occur in natural scenes. How does the human brain aggregate information about objects to represent scene categories? To explore this issue, we used statistical learning methods to learn categories that objectively capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in a large collection of natural scenes. Using the learned categories, we modeled fMRI brain signals evoked in human subjects when viewing images of scenes. We find that evoked activity across much of anterior visual cortex is explained by the learned categories. Furthermore, a decoder based on these scene categories accurately predicts the categories and objects comprising novel scenes from brain activity evoked by those scenes. These results suggest that the human brain represents scene categories that capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in the world."

https://openalex.org/W1964531150,"Dopamine is essential to cognitive functions. However, despite abundant studies demonstrating that dopamine neuron activity is related to reinforcement and motivation, little is known about what signals dopamine neurons convey to promote cognitive processing. We therefore examined dopamine neuron activity in monkeys performing a delayed matching-to-sample task that required working memory and visual search. We found that dopamine neurons responded to task events associated with cognitive operations. A subset of dopamine neurons were activated by visual stimuli if the monkey had to store the stimuli in working memory. These neurons were located dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta, whereas ventromedial dopamine neurons, some in the ventral tegmental area, represented reward prediction signals. Furthermore, dopamine neurons monitored visual search performance, becoming active when the monkey made an internal judgment that the search was successfully completed. Our findings suggest an anatomical gradient of dopamine signals along the dorsolateral-ventromedial axis of the ventral midbrain."
https://openalex.org/W1999615570,"How the cortex processes and transforms sensory input coming from the thalamus is still a matter of debate. Here the authors optogenetically silence local cortical circuits to show that intracortical excitation amplifies and prolongs thalamic inputs to the auditory cortex. Cortical processing of sensory information begins with the transformation of thalamically relayed signals. We optogenetically silenced intracortical circuits to isolate thalamic inputs to layer 4 neurons and found that intracortical excitation linearly amplified thalamocortical responses underlying frequency and direction selectivity, with spectral range and tuning preserved, and prolonged the response duration. This signal pre-amplification and prolongation enhanced the salience of thalamocortically relayed information and ensured its robust, faithful and more persistent representation."
https://openalex.org/W2070166996,"Oct4 is a core component of the regulatory network of pluripotency. Schöler and colleagues found that establishment of totipotency was not affected by genetic elimination of maternal Oct4a, with live offspring being born and oocytes able to reprogram somatic cell nuclei. However, ablation of both maternal and zygotic Oct4a led to the formation of an inner cell mass that was not pluripotent. Oct4A is a core component of the regulatory network of pluripotent cells, and by itself can reprogram neural stem cells into pluripotent cells in mice and humans. However, its role in defining totipotency and inducing pluripotency during embryonic development is still unclear. We genetically eliminated maternal Oct4A using a Cre/loxP approach in mouse and found that the establishment of totipotency was not affected, as shown by the generation of live pups. After complete inactivation of both maternal and zygotic Oct4A expression, the embryos still formed Oct4–GFP- and Nanog-expressing inner cell masses, albeit non-pluripotent, indicating that Oct4A is not a determinant for the pluripotent cell lineage separation. Interestingly, Oct4A-deficient oocytes were able to reprogram fibroblasts into pluripotent cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that, in contrast to its role in the maintenance of pluripotency, maternal Oct4A is not crucial for either the establishment of totipotency in embryos, or the induction of pluripotency in somatic cells using oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1999008171,"How tissue damage is detected to induce inflammatory responses is unclear. Most studies have focused on damage signals released by cell breakage and necrosis. Whether tissues use other cues in addition to cell lysis to detect that they are damaged is unknown. We find that osmolarity differences between interstitial fluid and the external environment mediate rapid leukocyte recruitment to sites of tissue damage in zebrafish by activating cytosolic phospholipase a2 (cPLA2) at injury sites. cPLA2 initiates the production of non-canonical arachidonate metabolites that mediate leukocyte chemotaxis through a 5-oxo-ETE receptor (OXE-R). Thus, tissues can detect damage through direct surveillance of barrier integrity, with cell swelling probably functioning as a pro-inflammatory intermediate in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2091086437,"Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is a DNA repair enzyme that is frequently defective in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although low ERCC1 expression correlates with platinum sensitivity, the clinical effectiveness of platinum therapy is limited, highlighting the need for alternative treatment strategies. To discover new mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for ERCC1-defective tumours, we performed high-throughput drug screens in an isogenic NSCLC model of ERCC1 deficiency and dissected the mechanism underlying ERCC1-selective effects by studying molecular biomarkers of tumour cell response. The high-throughput screens identified multiple clinical poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1/2) inhibitors, such as olaparib (AZD-2281), niraparib (MK-4827) and BMN 673, as being selective for ERCC1 deficiency. We observed that ERCC1-deficient cells displayed a significant delay in double-strand break repair associated with a profound and prolonged G2/M arrest following PARP1/2 inhibitor treatment. Importantly, we found that ERCC1 isoform 202, which has recently been shown to mediate platinum sensitivity, also modulated PARP1/2 sensitivity. A PARP1/2 inhibitor-synthetic lethal siRNA screen revealed that ERCC1 deficiency was epistatic with homologous recombination deficiency. However, ERCC1-deficient cells did not display a defect in RAD51 foci formation, suggesting that ERCC1 might be required to process PARP1/2 inhibitor-induced DNA lesions before DNA strand invasion. PARP1 silencing restored PARP1/2 inhibitor resistance in ERCC1-deficient cells but had no effect in ERCC1-proficient cells, supporting the hypothesis that PARP1 might be required for the ERCC1 selectivity of PARP1/2 inhibitors. This study suggests that PARP1/2 inhibitors as a monotherapy could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with ERCC1-deficient tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2047688303,"A strategy exploiting species-specific miRNA expression may provide another layer of biosafety in gain-of-function influenza experiments. Recent gain-of-function studies in influenza A virus H5N1 strains revealed that as few as three-amino-acid changes in the hemagglutinin protein confer the capacity for viral transmission between ferrets1,2. As transmission between ferrets is considered a surrogate indicator of transmissibility between humans, these studies raised concerns about the risks of gain-of-function influenza A virus research. Here we present an approach to strengthen the biosafety of gain-of-function influenza experiments. We exploit species-specific endogenous small RNAs to restrict influenza A virus tropism. In particular, we found that the microRNA miR-192 was expressed in primary human respiratory tract epithelial cells as well as in mouse lungs but absent from the ferret respiratory tract. Incorporation of miR-192 target sites into influenza A virus did not prevent influenza replication and transmissibility in ferrets, but did attenuate influenza pathogenicity in mice. This molecular biocontainment approach should be applicable beyond influenza A virus to minimize the risk of experiments involving other pathogenic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2044446034,"Caveolin-1 has a complex role in prostate cancer and has been suggested to be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. As mature caveolin-1 resides in caveolae, invaginated lipid raft domains at the plasma membrane, caveolae have been suggested as a tumor-promoting signaling platform in prostate cancer. However, caveola formation requires both caveolin-1 and cavin-1 (also known as PTRF; polymerase I and transcript release factor). Here, we examined the expression of cavin-1 in prostate epithelia and stroma using tissue microarray including normal, non-malignant and malignant prostate tissues. We found that caveolin-1 was induced without the presence of cavin-1 in advanced prostate carcinoma, an expression pattern mirrored in the PC-3 cell line. In contrast, normal prostate epithelia expressed neither caveolin-1 nor cavin-1, while prostate stroma highly expressed both caveolin-1 and cavin-1. Utilizing PC-3 cells as a suitable model for caveolin-1-positive advanced prostate cancer, we found that cavin-1 expression in PC-3 cells inhibits anchorage-independent growth, and reduces in vivo tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. The expression of α-smooth muscle actin in stroma along with interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cancer cells was also decreased in tumors of mice bearing PC-3-cavin-1 tumor cells. To determine whether cavin-1 acts by neutralizing caveolin-1, we expressed cavin-1 in caveolin-1-negative prostate cancer LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Caveolin-1 but not cavin-1 expression increased anchorage-independent growth in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Cavin-1 co-expression reversed caveolin-1 effects in caveolin-1-positive LNCaP cells. Taken together, these results suggest that caveolin-1 in advanced prostate cancer is present outside of caveolae, because of the lack of cavin-1 expression. Cavin-1 expression attenuates the effects of non-caveolar caveolin-1 microdomains partly via reduced IL-6 microenvironmental function. With circulating caveolin-1 as a potential biomarker for advanced prostate cancer, identification of the molecular pathways affected by cavin-1 could provide novel therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2075858986,"Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for cancer. However, multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major obstacle to effective chemotherapy, limiting the efficacy of both conventional chemotherapeutic and novel biologic agents. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a xenosensor, is a key regulator of MDR. It functions in xenobiotic detoxification by regulating the expression of phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, whose overexpression in cancers and whose role in drug resistance make them potential therapeutic targets for reducing MDR. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous negative regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in most cellular processes, including drug resistance. Here, we report the inversely related expression of miR-137 and CAR in parental and doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells, wherein miR-137 is downregulated in resistant cells. miR-137 overexpression resulted in downregulation of CAR protein and mRNA (via mRNA degradation); it sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to doxorubicin (as shown by reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and increased G2-phase cell cycle arrest) and reduced the in vivo growth rate of neuroblastoma xenografts. We observed similar results in cellular models of hepatocellular and colon cancers, indicating that the doxorubicin-sensitizing effect of miR-137 is not tumor type-specific. Finally, we show for the first time a negative feedback loop whereby miR-137 downregulates CAR expression and CAR downregulates miR-137 expression. Hypermethylation of the miR-137 promoter and negative regulation of miR-137 by CAR contribute in part to reduced miR-137 expression and increased CAR and MDR1 expression in doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells. These findings demonstrate that miR-137 is a crucial regulator of cancer response to doxorubicin treatment, and they identify miR-137 as a highly promising target to reduce CAR-driven doxorubicin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1967085665,"Although there have been numerous advances in our understanding of how apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii enter host cells, many of the signaling pathways and enzymes involved in the organization of invasion mediators remain poorly defined. We recently performed a forward chemical-genetic screen in T. gondii and identified compounds that markedly enhanced infectivity. Although molecular dissection of invasion has benefited from the use of small-molecule inhibitors, the mechanisms underlying induction of invasion by small-molecule enhancers have never been described. Here we identify the Toxoplasma ortholog of human APT1, palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (TgPPT1), as the target of one class of small-molecule enhancers. Inhibition of this uncharacterized thioesterase triggered secretion of invasion-associated organelles, increased motility and enhanced the invasive capacity of tachyzoites. We demonstrate that TgPPT1 is a bona fide depalmitoylase, thereby establishing an important role for dynamic and reversible palmitoylation in host-cell invasion by T. gondii."

In this study, we examined the specific role of NO in bleaching using the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella, a model system for the study of corals. Exposure of A. pulchella to high-temperature shock (26-33°C over <1 h) or an NO donor (S-nitrosoglutathione) resulted in significant increases in host caspase-like enzyme activity. These responses were reflected in the intensities of bleaching, which were significantly higher in heat- or NO-treated specimens than in controls maintained in seawater at 26°C. Notably, the inhibition of caspase-like activity prevented bleaching even in the presence of an NO donor or at elevated temperature. The additional use of an NO scavenger controlled for effects mediated by agents other than NO. We also exposed A. pulchella to a more ecologically relevant treatment (an increase from 26 to 33°C over 6-7 d). Again, host NO synthesis correlated with the activation of caspase-like enzyme activity. Therefore, we conclude that NO's involvement in cnidarian bleaching arises through the regulation of host apoptotic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2126031505,"Some patients with severe inflammatory disease fail to respond to glucocorticoids, and oxidative stress contributes to this insensitivity. Importin receptors are associated with nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is essential for glucocorticoid function. We hypothesized that importin-7 is central to GR nuclear translocation and glucocorticoid sensitivity. We investigated the effects of importin-7 siRNA on fluticasone propionate (FP)-induced GR nuclear localization and suppression of IL-1β-induced CXCL8 and the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plus IL-1β costimulation on importin-7 expression, function, and glucocorticoid responsiveness in a human macrophagecell line (U937). H2O2 significantly reduced FP-induced GR nuclear localization (3.4±0.51- vs. 5.7±0.85-fold increase, P<0.05) and suppression of IL-1β-induced CXCL8 (62.3±2.3 vs. 85.1±7.0%, P<0.05). Knockdown of importin-7 by 38.4 ± 11.5% (compared with control siRNA) significantly reduced FP-mediated GR nuclear localization (3.5±0.5- vs. 5.7±0.85-fold increase, P<0.05) and suppression of IL-1β-induced CXCL8 expression (40.2±16.1 vs. 68.4±3.0%, P<0.05). H2O2 plus IL-1β had no direct effect on importin-7 but caused a significant loss (61.2±12.6% compared with baseline) of nuclear RanGTP, an essential cofactor for importin-7-mediated nuclear import of cargo proteins. The importin-7 complex is essential for glucocorticoid function, and the expression of its cofactor RanGTP is reduced during oxidative stress-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1970402401,"The alteration of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling effector Smad2/3 was detected in several types of tumors, which acts as oncogenic factor and tumor suppressor, but the relationship between these events has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that PAK4 interacts with and modulates phosphorylation of Smad2/3 via both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms, which attenuate Smad2/3 axis transactivation and TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition in gastric cancer cells. First, PAK4 interaction with Smad2/3, which is independent of PAK4 kinase activity, blocks TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 Ser465/467 or Smad3 Ser423/425 and the consequent activation. In addition, PAK4 phosphorylates Smad2 on Ser465, leading to the degradation of Smad2 through ubiquitin–proteasome-dependent pathway under hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation. Interestingly, PAK4 expression correlates negatively with phospho-Ser465/467 Smad2 but positively with phospho-Ser465 Smad2 in gastric cancer tissues. Furthermore, the expressions of HGF, phospho-Ser474 PAK4 and phospho-Ser465 Smad2 are markedly increased in gastric cancer tissues, and the expression of Smad2 is decreased in gastric cancer tissues. Our results document an oncogenic role of PAK4 in repression of Smad2/3 transactivation that involved in tumorigenesis, and suggest PAK4 as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2160968619,"Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is the primary physical airway defense against inhaled pathogens and particulates. MCC depends on both proper fluid/mucus homeostasis and epithelial ciliary beating. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neurotransmitter expressed in the sinonasal epithelium that is up-regulated in allergy. However, the effects of VIP on human sinonasal physiology are unknown, as are VIP's interactions with histamine, a major regulator of allergic disease. We imaged ciliary beat frequency, mucociliary transport, apical Cl- permeability, and airway surface liquid (ASL) height in primary human sinonasal air-liquid-interface cultures to investigate the effects of VIP and histamine. VIP stimulated an increase in ciliary beat frequency (EC50 0.5 μM; maximal increase ~40% compared with control) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-dependent and Na+K+2Cl- cotransporter-dependent fluid secretion, all requiring cAMP/PKA signaling. Histamine activated Ca2+ signaling that increased ASL height but not ciliary beating. Low concentrations of VIP and histamine had synergistic effects on CFTR-dependent fluid secretion, revealed by increased ASL heights. An up-regulation of VIP in histamine-driven allergic rhinitis would likely enhance mucosal fluid secretion and contribute to allergic rhinorrhea. Conversely, a loss of VIP-activated secretion in patients with CF may impair mucociliary transport, contributing to increased incidences of sinonasal infections and rhinosinusitis.—Lee, R.

https://openalex.org/W2031640794,"Insulin is a major autoantigen in islet autoimmunity and progression to type 1 diabetes. It has been suggested that the insulin B-chain may be critical to insulin autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes. INS-IGF2 consists of the preproinsulin signal peptide, the insulin B-chain, and eight amino acids of the C-peptide in addition to 138 amino acids from the IGF2 gene. We aimed to determine the expression of INS-IGF2 in human pancreatic islets and autoantibodies in newly diagnosed children with type 1 diabetes and controls. INS-IGF2, expressed primarily in beta cells, showed higher levels of expression in islets from normal compared with donors with either type 2 diabetes (p = 0.006) or high HbA1c levels (p < 0.001). INS-IGF2 autoantibody levels were increased in newly diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 304) compared with healthy controls (n = 355; p < 0.001). Displacement with cold insulin and INS-IGF2 revealed that more patients than controls had doubly reactive insulin-INS-IGF2 autoantibodies. These data suggest that INS-IGF2, which contains the preproinsulin signal peptide, the B-chain, and eight amino acids of the C-peptide may be an autoantigen in type 1 diabetes. INS-IGF2 and insulin may share autoantibody-binding sites, thus complicating the notion that insulin is the primary autoantigen in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2024714363,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is caused by mutations in the NF2 gene that encodes a tumor-suppressor protein called merlin. NF2 is characterized by formation of multiple schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin loss-of-function is associated with increased activity of Rac and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and deregulation of cytoskeletal organization. LIM domain kinases (LIMK1 and 2) are substrate for Cdc42/Rac-PAK and modulate actin dynamics by phosphorylating cofilin at serine-3. This modification inactivates the actin severing and depolymerizing activity of cofilin. LIMKs also translocate into the nucleus and regulate cell cycle progression. Significantly, LIMKs are overexpressed in several tumor types, including skin, breast, lung, liver and prostate. Here we report that mouse Schwann cells (MSCs) in which merlin function is lost as a result of Nf2 exon2 deletion (Nf2(ΔEx2)) exhibited increased levels of LIMK1, LIMK2 and active phospho-Thr508/505-LIMK1/2, as well as phospho-Ser3-cofilin, compared with wild-type normal MSCs. Similarly, levels of LIMK1 and 2 total protein and active phosphorylated forms were elevated in human vestibular schwannomas compared with normal human Schwann cells (SCs). Reintroduction of wild-type NF2 into Nf2(ΔEx2) MSC reduced LIMK1 and LIMK2 levels. We show that pharmacological inhibition of LIMK with BMS-5 decreased the viability of Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect viability of control MSCs. Similarly, LIMK knockdown decreased viability of Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs. The decreased viability of Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs was not due to caspase-dependent or -independent apoptosis, but rather due to inhibition of cell cycle progression as evidenced by accumulation of cells in G2/M phase. Inhibition of LIMKs arrests cells in early mitosis by decreasing aurora A activation. Our results suggest that LIMKs are potential drug targets for NF2 and tumors associated with merlin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1984914475,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) produces the pro-survival sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate and has been implicated in inflammation, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Recent studies identified TRAF2 as a sphingosine 1-phosphate target, implicating SK1 in activation of the NF-κB pathway, but the functional consequences of this connection on gene expression are unknown. Here, we find that loss of SK1 potentiates induction of the chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; also known as CCL5) in HeLa cells stimulated with TNF-α despite RANTES induction being highly dependent on the NF-κB pathway. Additionally, we find that SK1 is not required for TNF-induced IKK phosphorylation, IκB degradation, nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, and transcriptional NF-κB activity. In contrast, loss of SK1 prevented TNF-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and inhibition of p38 MAPK, like SK1 knockdown, also potentiates RANTES induction. Finally, in addition to RANTES, loss of SK1 also potentiated the induction of multiple chemokines and cytokines in the TNF response. Taken together, these data identify a potential and novel anti-inflammatory function of SK1 in which chemokine levels are suppressed through SK1-mediated activation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, in this system, activation of NF-κB is dissociated from SK1, suggesting that the interaction between these pathways may be more complex than currently thought."

https://openalex.org/W2167716741,"Pin1, a conserved eukaryotic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, has profound effects on numerous key-signaling molecules, and its deregulation contributes to disease, particularly cancer. Although Pin1-mediated prolyl isomerization of protein servers as a regulatory switch in signaling pathways, the significance of proline isomerase activity in chromatin modifying complex remains unclear. Here, we identify Pin1 as a key negative regulator for suppressor of variegation 3–9 homologue 1 (SUV39H1) stability, a major methyltransferase responsible for histone H3 trimethylation on Lys9 (H3K9me3). Pin1 interacts with SUV39H1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and promotes ubiquitination-mediated degradation of SUV39H1. Consequently, Pin1 reduces SUV39H1 abundance and suppresses SUV39H1 ability to induce H3K9me3. In contrast, depletion of Pin1 in cancer cells leads to elevated SUV39H1 expression, which subsequently increases H3K9me3, inhibiting tumorigenecity of cancer cells. In a xenograft model with 4T1 metastatic mouse breast carcinoma cells, Pin1 overexpression increases tumor growth, whereas SUV39H1 overexpression abrogates it. In human breast cancer patients, immunohistochemical staining shows that Pin1 levels are negatively correlated with SUV39H1 as well as H3K9me3 levels. Thus, Pin1-mediated reduction of SUV39H1 stability contributes to convey oncogenic signals for aggressiveness of human breast cancer, suggesting that Pin1 may be a promising drug target for anticancer therapy.—Khanal, P., Kim, G., Lim, S.-C, Yun, H.-J., Lee, K.

Previous work has shown that the partial loss (i.e. residues 12–78) of the SLP-76 SAM region can impair positive and negative thymic selection (49.Shen S. Lau J. Zhu M. Zou J. Fuller D. Li Q.J.

Despite the importance of SLP-76, it has been unclear whether the adaptor can directly self-associate in response to T-cell receptor ligation and whether this event is needed for the activation of T-cells. Although complexes comprised of SLP-76 associated with adaptors such as Nck and Vav-1 have been described (50.Barda-Saad M. Shirasu N. Pauker M.H. Hassan N. Perl O. Balbo A. Yamaguchi H. Houtman J.C.

Cooperative interactions at the SLP-76 complex are critical for actin polymerization.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2315-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the direct binding of SLP-76 to SLP-76 has not been reported. Here, we report that anti-CD3 induces SLP-76 self-association mediated by the SAM domain, and this event was needed for SLP-76 microcluster formation and T-cell activation. Furthermore, different regions in the SAM domain contributed to this self-association with the H5 helix alone supporting co-precipitation of SLP-76 at reduced levels, smaller microclusters, and enhanced T-cell activation. Our data identified for the first time that anti-CD3 ligation induces SLP-76 self-association as mediated by its N-terminal SAM domain. SLP-76-deficient Jurkat J14 T-cells (gift from A. Weiss, University of California, San Francisco) were cultured as described (51.Schneider H. Smith X. Liu H. Bismuth G. Rudd C.E.

SLP-76-EYFP was constructed by subcloning SLP-76 cDNA into the XhoI/BamHI sites of pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Madison, WI). The dN57 mutant was generated by replacing the full-length SLP-76 with PCR-amplified cDNA coding 58 to 533 amino acids into SpeI/BamHI sites of SLP-76-EYFP plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W2048618111,"Renal transplantation remains the best treatment option for patients with end-stage renal failure. However, the shortage of renal grafts remains a big challenge. Renal graft ischemic injuries that occur before and after graft retrieval have a devastating effect on graft survival, especially on grafts from marginal donors. This study was conducted to assess the protective effect against ischemic injury of a preservative solution supplemented with xenon (Xe), when used on ex vivo kidney grafts in a rat renal transplant model, and to explore the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Lewis rat renal grafts were stored in Soltran preservative solution at 4°C, saturated with nitrogen (N2) or Xe gas (70% Xe or N2, with 5% CO2 balanced with O2) for 24 or 48 h. Grafts stored in Xe-saturated preservative solution demonstrated significantly less severe histopathologic changes, together with enhanced B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and heat shock protein (HSP)-70 expression. After engraftment in the Lewis rat recipient, renal function was significantly improved in the Xe-treated grafts, and macrophage infiltration and fibrosis were reduced. Xe exposure enhanced Bcl-2 and HSP-70 expression in human renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells and prevented mitochondrial and nuclear damage. The release of the apoptogenic factors cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and proinflammatory high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB-1) was effectively suppressed. This study thus demonstrated for the first time that Xe confers renoprotection on renal grafts ex vivo and is likely to stabilize cellular structure during ischemic insult. The current study has significant clinical implications, in which the use of Xe ex vivo could enhance the marginal donor pool of renal grafts by preventing graft loss due to ischemia.—Zhao, H., Ning, J., Savage, S., Kang, H., Lu, K., Zheng, X., George, A.

https://openalex.org/W2057944331,"Dual inhibitors of the closely related receptor tyrosine kinases insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor (IR) are promising therapeutic agents in cancer. Here, we report an unusually selective class of dual inhibitors of IGF-1R and IR identified in a parallel screen of known kinase inhibitors against a panel of 300 human protein kinases. Biochemical and structural studies indicate that this class achieves its high selectivity by binding to the ATP-binding pocket of inactive, unphosphorylated IGF-1R/IR and stabilizing the activation loop in a native-like inactive conformation. One member of this compound family was originally reported as an inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase ERK, a kinase that is distinct in the structure of its unphosphorylated/inactive form from IR/IGF-1R. Remarkably, this compound binds to the ATP-binding pocket of ERK in an entirely different conformation to that of IGF-1R/IR, explaining the potency against these two structurally distinct kinase families. These findings suggest a novel approach to polypharmacology in which two or more unrelated kinases are inhibited by a single compound that targets different conformations of each target kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2130926587,"Epithelial Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-3 (NHE3) transport is fundamental for renal and intestinal sodium reabsorption. Cytoplasmic protons are thought to serve as allosteric modifiers of the exchanger and to trigger its transport through protein conformational change. This effect presupposes an intracellular pH (pHi) dependence of NHE3 activity, although the biophysical and molecular basis of NHE3 pHi sensitivity have not been defined. NHE3, when complexed with the calcineurin homologous protein-1 (CHP1), had a shift in pHi sensitivity (0.4 units) toward the acidic side in comparison with NHE3 alone, as measured by oscillating pH electrodes combined with whole-cell patch clamping. Indeed, CHP1 interaction with NHE3 inhibited NHE3 transport in a pHi -dependent manner. CHP1 binding to NHE3 also affected its acute regulation. Intracellular perfusion of peptide from the CHP1 binding region (or pHi modification to reduce the CHP1 amount bound to NHE3) was permissive and cooperative for dopamine inhibition of NHE3 but reversed that of adenosine. Thus, CHP1 interaction with NHE3 apparently establishes the exchanger set point for pHi, and modification in this set point is effective in the hormonal stimuli-mediated regulation of NHE3. CHP1 may serve as a regulatory cofactor for NHE3 conformational change, dependent on intracellular protonation."
https://openalex.org/W1976512618,"Transcription factor E2F-1 and its interaction with pRb provide a key point of control in cell proliferation. E2F-1 participates in both cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and in cells exists with a DP dimerization partner protein, the most prominent being DP-1. By mining the tumor tissue and cancer cell line encyclopedia genomic databases, we identified the first somatic mutations in the DP-1 gene and describe 53 distinct mutation events here. The mutations are mostly missense mutations, but also include nonsense and frame-shift mutations that result in truncated DP-1 derivatives. Mutation occurs throughout the DP-1 gene but generally leaves protein dimerization activity intact. This allows the mutant derivatives to affect the properties of the E2F-1/DP-1 heterodimer through a transdominant mechanism, which changes the DNA binding, transcriptional activation and pRb-binding properties of the heterodimer. In particular, many DP-1 mutants were found to impair E2F-1-dependent apoptosis. Our results establish that somatic mutations in DP-1 uncouple normal control of the E2F pathway, and thus define a new mechanism that could contribute to aberrant proliferation in tumor cells."
